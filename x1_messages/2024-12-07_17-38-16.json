        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that exactly two out of three randomly selected students wear glasses. There are 15 students in total, with 6 wearing glasses and 9 not wearing glasses.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for probability. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the scenarios where exactly two out of the three selected students wear glasses.\n\nSince the selection is random and without replacement (I assume), I should use combinations to figure out the number of ways to choose the students.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Total students: 15\n\n- Students wearing glasses: 6\n\n- Students not wearing glasses: 9\n\nI need to select 3 students, and exactly 2 of them should wear glasses.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 students who wear glasses out of 6 is C(6,2), and the number of ways to choose 1 student who does not wear glasses out of 9 is C(9,1).\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 3 students out of 15 is C(15,3).\n\nTherefore, the probability should be:\n\nP(exactly 2 wear glasses) = [C(6,2) * C(9,1)] / C(15,3)\n\nI need to calculate these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(6,2) is calculated as:\n\nC(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = (6*5*4!) / (2*1 * 4!) = (6*5) / 2 = 15\n\nNext, C(9,1) is simply 9.\n\nThen, C(15,3) is:\n\nC(15,3) = 15! / (3! * (15-3)!) = (15*14*13*12!) / (6 * 12!)) = (15*14*13) / 6\n\nCalculating numerator: 15*14 = 210, 210*13 = 2730\n\nDenominator: 6\n\nSo, C(15,3) = 2730 / 6 = 455\n\nNow, plug these back into the probability formula:\n\nP = (15 * 9) / 455 = 135 / 455\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n135 / 5 = 27\n\n455 / 5 = 91\n\nSo, P = 27 / 91\n\nWait, can this be simplified further? Let's see.\n\n27 and 91.\n\n27 is 3^3, and 91 is 7*13. No common factors, so 27/91 is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two of the three selected students wear glasses is 27/91.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to better understand it.\n\n27 divided by 91 is approximately 0.2967, or about 29.67%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 29.67% chance that exactly two out of three randomly selected students wear glasses.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nC(6,2) = 15, C(9,1) = 9, C(15,3) = 455.\n\n15 * 9 = 135\n\n135 / 455 = 27/91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step using probability rules.\n\nThe probability of selecting two students with glasses and one without, in a specific order.\n\nFor example, the first two with glasses and the third without.\n\nThe probability of the first student having glasses is 6/15.\n\nGiven that, the probability of the second student having glasses is 5/14.\n\nThen, the probability of the third student not having glasses is 9/13.\n\nSo, the probability for this specific sequence is (6/15) * (5/14) * (9/13).\n\nBut since the two students with glasses can be in any order among the three selections, I need to account for all possible orders.\n\nThere are C(3,2) = 3 ways to arrange two with glasses and one without.\n\nSo, total probability is 3 * [(6/15) * (5/14) * (9/13)]\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, (6/15) = 0.4\n\n(5/14) \u2248 0.3571\n\n(9/13) \u2248 0.6923\n\nMultiplying these: 0.4 * 0.3571 \u2248 0.14284\n\nThen, 0.14284 * 0.6923 \u2248 0.0989\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 3 * 0.0989 \u2248 0.2967\n\nWhich matches the earlier result of 27/91 \u2248 0.2967.\n\nGood, it's consistent.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 27/91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{27}{91}} \\]"
