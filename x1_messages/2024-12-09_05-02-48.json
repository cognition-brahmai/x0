        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 houses in a row, and we need to figure out which house is second from the right based on some clues.\n\nFirst clue: The blue house is to the left of the red house, but not necessarily next to it. So, blue is somewhere to the left of red, but there might be other houses in between.\n\nSecond clue: The green house is immediately to the right of the white house. So, white and green are next to each other, with green right after white.\n\nThird clue: The first house on the left is white.\n\nAlright, let's start by placing the first house. Since the first house is white, and green is immediately to the right of white, the second house must be green.\n\nSo, house 1: white\nHouse 2: green\n\nNow, we have two houses left: blue and red.\n\nThe blue house is to the left of the red house, but not necessarily next to it.\n\nSo, in the remaining two positions (houses 3 and 4), blue must be to the left of red.\n\nThat means house 3 could be blue and house 4 red, or both houses 3 and 4 could be red and blue in some order, but given that blue is to the left of red, the only possibility is house 3: blue, house 4: red.\n\nWait, no. If blue is to the left of red, and they don't have to be next to each other, then in houses 3 and 4, blue could be in house 3 and red in house 4, or blue in house 3 and red in house 4, or blue in house 3 and red in house 4. Wait, that's the same as the first option.\n\nActually, since there are only two houses left, and blue must be to the left of red, the only arrangement is blue in house 3 and red in house 4.\n\nSo, the full arrangement is:\n\nHouse 1: white\nHouse 2: green\nHouse 3: blue\nHouse 4: red\n\nNow, the question is, which house is second from the right?\n\nSecond from the right would be house 3 (since house 4 is the last on the right, and house 3 is second from the right).\n\nSo, house 3 is blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the blue house.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check.\n\nFirst house: white\nSecond house: green\nThird house: blue\nFourth house: red\n\nYes, second from the right is house 3, which is blue.\n\nSo, the answer is the blue house.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{blue house}} \\]"
