        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: in a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what's the probability of drawing four cards of the same rank, like all four Kings, for example. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what's in a standard deck. There are 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 ranks: ace through 10, and then jack, queen, and king. So, there are four cards of each rank in the deck.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of drawing four cards of the same rank. That means I need to pick all four cards that share the same rank, like all four aces, or all four kings, or all four queens, and so on.\n\nI think the first step is to figure out the total number of possible ways to draw four cards from the deck, regardless of their ranks. Since the order doesn't matter here, I believe this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, in this case, n = 52 (total cards), and k = 4 (cards to draw). Plugging into the formula:\n\nTotal possible combinations = C(52, 4) = 52! / (4!(52 - 4)!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 270,725.\n\nAlright, so there are 270,725 different ways to draw four cards from the deck.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many of these combinations consist of all four cards being of the same rank. Since there are 13 ranks in the deck (ace through king), and for each rank, there's only one way to choose all four cards of that rank (because there are exactly four cards per rank).\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me think. For a given rank, say kings, there are four kings in the deck, and I need to choose all four of them. So, the number of ways to choose all four kings is C(4, 4) = 1. Similarly, for queens, it's C(4, 4) = 1, and so on for each rank.\n\nSince there are 13 ranks, the total number of favorable combinations would be 13 \u00d7 1 = 13.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If I want all four cards to be kings, there's only one way to do that, because there are exactly four kings. Same for queens, jacks, and so on, up to aces. So, yes, 13 favorable combinations in total.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = favorable combinations / total combinations = 13 / 270,725.\n\nLet me calculate that fraction.\n\n13 divided by 270,725 is approximately 0.000048, or 4.8 \u00d7 10^-5.\n\nTo express this as a probability, I can leave it in decimal form, or maybe convert it to a percentage.\n\nAs a percentage, that's 0.0048%, which is a very small chance.\n\nWait a second, does this seem right? Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to think about the probability step by step, considering the draws one at a time.\n\nAssuming that the cards are drawn without replacement, since we're drawing a hand of four cards.\n\nSo, the probability that the first card is of a certain rank is 4/52, since there are four cards of each rank in the deck.\n\nBut actually, since we don't care about the rank of the first card, just that all four cards are of the same rank, maybe that's not the best way.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the first card can be any card, then the second card must match the rank of the first card, and so on.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nProbability that the first card is any card: 52/52 = 1.\n\nProbability that the second card matches the rank of the first card: 3/51, because there are three remaining cards of that rank out of the remaining 51 cards.\n\nProbability that the third card matches the rank: 2/50, since two cards of that rank are left out of the remaining 50 cards.\n\nProbability that the fourth card matches the rank: 1/49, as only one card of that rank is left out of the remaining 49 cards.\n\nSo, the overall probability would be:\n\n1 \u00d7 (3/51) \u00d7 (2/50) \u00d7 (1/49).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 3/51 = 1/17.\n\nThen, 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nThen, 1/49.\n\nSo, probability = (1/17) \u00d7 (1/25) \u00d7 (1/49) = 1 / (17 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 49).\n\nLet's compute the denominator:\n\n17 \u00d7 25 = 425.\n\n425 \u00d7 49 = let's see, 400 \u00d7 49 = 19,600, and 25 \u00d7 49 = 1,225. So, total is 19,600 + 1,225 = 20,825.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, 17 \u00d7 25 = 425.\n\n425 \u00d7 49:\n\n400 \u00d7 49 = 19,600.\n\n25 \u00d7 49 = 1,225.\n\nTotal = 19,600 + 1,225 = 20,825.\n\nWait, but I recall that earlier I had total combinations as 270,725, but according to this, it's 13 / 270,725, but now I'm getting 1 / 20,825.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something in this approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered that there are 13 favorable combinations (one for each rank) out of total C(52,4) = 270,725 combinations, giving probability 13 / 270,725.\n\nIn the second approach, I got 1 / 20,825.\n\nThese two results need to be consistent, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that there are 13 different ranks, and for each rank, the probability is 1 / 20,825, but since there are 13 ranks, the total probability is 13 / 20,825.\n\nWait, but that would be 13 / 20,825 = 13 / 20,825.\n\nBut earlier, I had total combinations as 270,725, and 13 / 270,725.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating C(52,4).\n\nLet me recalculate C(52,4):\n\nC(52,4) = 52! / (4! \u00d7 48!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49) / 24.\n\nCalculating numerator: 52 \u00d7 51 = 2,652.\n\n2,652 \u00d7 50 = 132,600.\n\n132,600 \u00d7 49 = 6,500,000 - wait, let's do it step by step.\n\n2,652 \u00d7 50 = 132,600.\n\n132,600 \u00d7 49:\n\n132,600 \u00d7 50 = 6,630,000.\n\nSubtract 132,600 (since it's 49, which is 50 - 1) = 6,630,000 - 132,600 = 6,497,400.\n\nNow, divide by 24:\n\n6,497,400 / 24.\n\n24 \u00d7 270,725 = 24 \u00d7 270,000 = 6,480,000, plus 24 \u00d7 725 = 17,400, total 6,497,400.\n\nSo, yes, C(52,4) = 270,725.\n\nNow, in the second approach, I got 1 / 20,825, but according to the first approach, it should be 13 / 270,725.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to multiply by 13 in the second approach as well, since there are 13 different ranks possible.\n\nSo, if for one rank, the probability is 1 / 20,825, then for 13 ranks, it would be 13 / 20,825.\n\nBut according to the first approach, it's 13 / 270,725.\n\nSo, are these two fractions equal?\n\nLet's check: is 13 / 20,825 equal to 13 / 270,725?\n\nClearly not, since 20,825 \u2260 270,725.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nLet me re-examine the second approach.\n\nIn the second approach, I considered the probability of drawing four cards of the same rank in a specific order.\n\nBut actually, the order doesn't matter in this problem, since we're just dealing with a hand of four cards.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to account for the different orders in which the four cards can be drawn.\n\nWait, no. In the second approach, I started with the first card being any card, and then specified the probabilities for the subsequent cards to match the first card's rank.\n\nBut, since the order doesn't matter, that should still give the correct probability.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe I need to consider that the first card can be any card, and then the remaining three cards must all match that rank.\n\nSo, probability = (number of ways to choose four cards of the same rank) / (total number of ways to choose any four cards).\n\nWe already have the numerator as 13 (since there are 13 ranks), and the denominator is C(52,4) = 270,725.\n\nSo, probability should be 13 / 270,725.\n\nBut in the second approach, I got 1 / 20,825.\n\nSo, there's inconsistency here, and I need to resolve it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in the second approach, I'm calculating the probability for a specific rank, and then I need to multiply by the number of ranks.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nProbability for one specific rank: 1 \u00d7 (3/51) \u00d7 (2/50) \u00d7 (1/49) = 1 / (17 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 49) = 1 / 20,825.\n\nSince there are 13 ranks, the total probability is 13 \u00d7 (1 / 20,825) = 13 / 20,825.\n\nBut according to the first approach, it's 13 / 270,725.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator in the second approach.\n\nLet me recalculate the denominator for the second approach.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw any four cards is C(52,4) = 270,725, as before.\n\nNow, the number of favorable ways is 13 (one for each rank).\n\nSo, probability should be 13 / 270,725.\n\nBut according to the second approach, I have 13 / 20,825.\n\nSo, there must be an error in the second approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second approach is incorrect because it's considering the probability for a specific sequence, whereas in reality, the order doesn't matter.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that the first card can be any card, and then the next three cards must match its rank.\n\nSo, probability:\n\nFirst card: any card, so probability 1.\n\nSecond card: must match the first card's rank, so 3 / 51.\n\nThird card: must also match the first card's rank, so 2 / 50.\n\nFourth card: must match the first card's rank, so 1 / 49.\n\nSo, overall probability: 1 \u00d7 (3/51) \u00d7 (2/50) \u00d7 (1/49).\n\nBut this seems to be the probability for a specific rank.\n\nHowever, since the first card can be of any rank, and we're not specifying which rank it is, this should cover all possible ranks.\n\nWait, but in reality, this calculation is for the probability that four specific cards drawn in sequence are all of the same rank.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, perhaps I need to multiply this probability by the number of ranks.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to 13 / 20,825.\n\nBut this contradicts the first approach.\n\nSo, perhaps the first approach is correct, and the second approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in the second approach, the probability calculated is for any specific rank, and since there are 13 ranks, the total probability is 13 times that.\n\nSo, 13 / 20,825.\n\nBut according to the first approach, it's 13 / 270,725.\n\nThese two fractions are not equal, so there's still a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator in the second approach.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nTotal number of ways to draw four cards: C(52,4) = 270,725.\n\nNumber of favorable ways: 13 (one for each rank).\n\nSo, probability should be 13 / 270,725.\n\nIn the second approach, I calculated the probability for one specific rank as 1 \u00d7 (3/51) \u00d7 (2/50) \u00d7 (1/49) = 1 / (17 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 49) = 1 / 20,825.\n\nThen, for 13 ranks, it would be 13 / 20,825.\n\nBut 13 / 20,825 simplifies to 13 / 20,825, which is not equal to 13 / 270,725.\n\nSo, clearly, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the second approach is actually calculating the probability for a specific sequence, and I need to account for all possible sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to realize that the probability calculated in the second approach is actually the probability for one specific rank, considering the order of drawing.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, perhaps I need to multiply by the number of ways to arrange the four cards.\n\nWait, no, that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second approach needs to be adjusted because it's considering the probability for a specific sequence, whereas in reality, the four cards can be drawn in any order.\n\nSo, maybe I need to multiply by the number of ways to arrange the four cards.\n\nWait, but that might not be necessary because combinations don't consider order.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach altogether.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use the concept of hypergeometric distribution, which deals with sampling without replacement.\n\nIn hypergeometric distribution, the probability of k successes in n draws from a finite population of size N containing exactly K successes is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) \u00d7 C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- N = 52 (total cards)\n\n- K = 4 (cards of a particular rank)\n\n- n = 4 (cards drawn)\n\n- k = 4 (all four cards of the same rank)\n\nSo, the probability of drawing all four cards of a specific rank is:\n\nP(X = 4) = [C(4, 4) \u00d7 C(52 - 4, 4 - 4)] / C(52, 4) = [1 \u00d7 C(48, 0)] / 270,725 = (1 \u00d7 1) / 270,725 = 1 / 270,725\n\nBut since there are 13 different ranks, the total probability is 13 \u00d7 (1 / 270,725) = 13 / 270,725.\n\nThis matches the first approach I took.\n\nSo, according to this, the probability is 13 / 270,725.\n\nBut earlier, in the second approach, I got 13 / 20,825, which is different.\n\nSo, perhaps the second approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a calculation error in the second approach.\n\nLet me re-examine the second approach.\n\nProbability:\n\nFirst card: any card, probability 1.\n\nSecond card: must match the first card's rank, probability 3/51.\n\nThird card: must match the first card's rank, probability 2/50.\n\nFourth card: must match the first card's rank, probability 1/49.\n\nSo, overall probability: 1 \u00d7 (3/51) \u00d7 (2/50) \u00d7 (1/49) = (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49) = 6 / 124,950 = 1 / 20,825.\n\nThen, for 13 ranks, it's 13 / 20,825.\n\nBut according to the hypergeometric approach, it's 13 / 270,725.\n\nThese two results are different, so there must be an error in one of the approaches.\n\nAfter checking, I realize that in the hypergeometric approach, the probability for one specific rank is 1 / C(52,4) = 1 / 270,725, but since there are 13 ranks, the total probability is 13 / 270,725.\n\nIn the second approach, the probability calculated is for a specific sequence, but since the order doesn't matter, multiplying by 13 should give the total probability.\n\nHowever, 13 / 20,825 is not equal to 13 / 270,725, so there's still a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the second approach by considering that the first card can be any card, and then the remaining three must match its rank.\n\nBut in reality, the first card sets the rank, and the remaining three must match that rank.\n\nSo, the probability should be 1 \u00d7 (3/51) \u00d7 (2/50) \u00d7 (1/49).\n\nBut according to the hypergeometric distribution, it's 1 / C(52,4).\n\nWait, no, hypergeometric distribution gives P(X = 4) = C(4,4) * C(48,0) / C(52,4) = 1 / 270,725 for a specific rank.\n\nSince there are 13 ranks, total probability is 13 / 270,725.\n\nSo, I think the correct probability is 13 / 270,725.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 13 / 270,725.\n\nTo express this as a decimal, it's approximately 0.000048, or 4.8 \u00d7 10^-5.\n\nAs a percentage, that's 0.0048%.\n\nSo, it's a very rare event to draw four cards of the same rank from a standard deck of 52 cards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{270725}} \\]"
