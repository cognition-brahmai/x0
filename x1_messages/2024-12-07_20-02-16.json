        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains leaving Town A and Town B at the same time, heading towards each other. The first train from Town A is going at 80 km/h, and the one from Town B is going at 100 km/h. The distance between the two towns is 360 km. We need to find out how far apart they will be after 1 hour.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. Both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly the distance between them is closing.\n\nSo, the speed of the first train is 80 km/h, and the second train is 100 km/h. Together, they are closing the distance at a rate of 80 + 100 = 180 km/h.\n\nNow, if they are closing the distance at 180 km per hour, then in 1 hour, they would have covered 180 km.\n\nThe initial distance between them was 360 km. So, after 1 hour, the distance between them should be 360 km minus the distance they've covered together, which is 180 km.\n\nTherefore, 360 km - 180 km = 180 km.\n\nSo, after 1 hour, the trains will be 180 km apart.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how far each train has traveled in 1 hour and then see how much distance is left between them.\n\nThe first train travels 80 km in 1 hour, and the second train travels 100 km in 1 hour.\n\nSo, together, they have covered 80 km + 100 km = 180 km in 1 hour.\n\nSubtracting that from the initial 360 km, we get 360 km - 180 km = 180 km.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider their relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is 180 km/h, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThe formula for distance when time is given is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, the distance they close in 1 hour is 180 km/h \u00d7 1 h = 180 km.\n\nSubtracting that from the initial distance gives us 360 km - 180 km = 180 km.\n\nTherefore, after 1 hour, the trains are 180 km apart.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider, like whether they are moving on the same track or anything like that. The question doesn't mention anything about the tracks, so I'll assume they are on a straight path towards each other without any obstacles.\n\nAlso, the speeds are constant, so no need to worry about acceleration or deceleration.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the trains will be 180 km apart after 1 hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
