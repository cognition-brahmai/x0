        "content": "So I have this cylindrical container, and it has a radius of 3 inches and a height of 10 inches. I need to find out its volume in cubic inches. I remember that the volume of a cylinder is calculated using a specific formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I think it involves the radius and the height, and maybe pi is involved somewhere. Let me try to recall the formula.\n\nI believe the formula for the volume of a cylinder is V equals pi times the radius squared times the height. So, V = \u03c0r\u00b2h. Does that sound right? Well, to make sure, let's break it down. The base of the cylinder is a circle, and the area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2. Then, multiplying that area by the height of the cylinder should give us the volume. That makes sense.\n\nSo, given that the radius r is 3 inches and the height h is 10 inches, I can plug these values into the formula. Let's do that.\n\nFirst, calculate the radius squared: 3 inches squared is 9 square inches.\n\nThen, multiply that by pi. Pi is approximately 3.14159, so 9 times 3.14159 is about 28.27431 square inches.\n\nFinally, multiply that result by the height, which is 10 inches: 28.27431 times 10 equals 282.7431 cubic inches.\n\nSo, the volume of the cylindrical container is approximately 282.74 cubic inches.\n\nBut, I'm thinking, maybe I should leave the answer in terms of pi for exactness. Let's try that again.\n\nUsing the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, and plugging in r = 3 inches and h = 10 inches, we get V = \u03c0*(3)^2*10 = \u03c0*9*10 = 90\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nThat's another way to express it, which is more precise since it doesn't involve approximating pi.\n\nAlternatively, if I need a numerical value, I can use the approximation \u03c0 \u2248 3.14, so V \u2248 90*3.14 = 282.6 cubic inches.\n\nBut actually, for more precision, I can use \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159, which gives V \u2248 90*3.14159 = 282.7431 cubic inches, as I calculated earlier.\n\nHmm, I wonder if there's a way to calculate this without using pi, or if that's the only way.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think about the volume in terms of the area of the base times the height. The base is a circle with radius 3 inches, so area A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*9 = 9\u03c0 square inches. Then, multiplying by the height of 10 inches gives volume V = 9\u03c0*10 = 90\u03c0 cubic inches. That's the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the cylinder as a stack of circular disks, each with thickness dh, and integrate along the height, but that seems like overkill for this problem since we have a straightforward formula.\n\nI should also consider units to make sure they're consistent. The radius is in inches, the height is in inches, so the volume should be in cubic inches, which it is.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nFirst, r = 3 inches, so r\u00b2 = 9 square inches.\n\nThen, V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0*9*10 = 90\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159, V \u2248 90*3.14159 = 282.7431 cubic inches.\n\nAlternatively, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.14, V \u2248 90*3.14 = 282.6 cubic inches.\n\nSo, approximately 282.74 cubic inches is accurate enough.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that could affect the volume, like the thickness of the container walls or if it's open or closed at the top and bottom. But since the problem doesn't specify any of that, I assume it's a thin-walled cylinder and we're to consider the internal volume.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the height given is the total height including the tops and bottoms, but again, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that the height given is the vertical height of the cylinder.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. It's a straightforward volume calculation for a right circular cylinder.\n\nSo, the volume is either 90\u03c0 cubic inches exactly, or approximately 282.74 cubic inches.\n\nI think for most practical purposes, giving the numerical approximation is sufficient, but leaving it in terms of pi is more precise.\n\nPerhaps I should present both answers.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cylindrical container is 90\u03c0 cubic inches, or approximately 282.74 cubic inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90\\pi \\text{ cubic inches} \\approx 282.74 \\text{ cubic inches}} \\]"
