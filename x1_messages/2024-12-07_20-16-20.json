        "content": "So, you're driving at an average speed of 45 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, and you want to know how far you'll travel. To figure this out, we can use the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nHere, the speed is 45 miles per hour, and the time is 2.5 hours. So, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 45 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nNow, multiplying 45 by 2.5:\n\n\\[ 45 \\times 2.5 = 112.5 \\]\n\nSo, you will travel 112.5 miles.\n\nBut let's double-check that. Another way to think about it is to break down the time into hours and fractions of an hour. 2.5 hours is the same as 2 hours and 0.5 hours. So, the distance can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = (\\text{Speed} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours}) + (\\text{Speed} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{hours}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = (45 \\times 2) + (45 \\times 0.5) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 90 + 22.5 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 112.5 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nYeah, that matches the first calculation. So, you'll travel 112.5 miles.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this. For example, what if the speed wasn't constant, and you were accelerating or decelerating? But the problem says you're driving at an average speed of 45 mph, so the average speed takes into account any changes in speed over the journey. Therefore, using the formula Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time is appropriate here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. Make sure that the units for speed and time are compatible. In this case, speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so the units work out correctly for distance in miles.\n\nAlso, if you wanted to convert the distance to another unit, like kilometers, you could do that. There are approximately 1.60934 kilometers in a mile, so:\n\n\\[ 112.5 \\, \\text{miles} \\times 1.60934 \\, \\text{km/mile} \\approx 181.067 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\nBut since the question was in miles, 112.5 miles is the answer.\n\nLet me think if there's any other aspect to this. Maybe considering real-world factors, like stops or traffic, but the problem gives an average speed, so those factors are already accounted for in the average.\n\nSo, in conclusion, driving at an average speed of 45 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, you will travel 112.5 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112.5 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
