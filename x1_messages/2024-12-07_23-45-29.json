        "content": "Let's see. There are 12 people who always tell the truth and 8 who always lie. So, in total, there are 20 people in the room. Now, I ask everyone how many liars are in the room. I need to find out how many different answers I will get.\n\nFirst, let's consider the truth-tellers. Since they always tell the truth, each truth-teller will give the correct number of liars in the room. There are 8 liars, so each truth-teller will say \"8.\"\n\nNow, the liars. They always lie, so each liar will give a number that is not the actual number of liars. So, they won't say \"8.\" But what else could they say? Well, they could say any number except 8. But the question is, how many different answers will I get?\n\nSo, from the truth-tellers, I have one answer: \"8.\" From the liars, since each can say any number except 8, potentially, they could each say a different number. But the question is about how many different answers I will get, not how many different answers are possible.\n\nWait, but in reality, the liars could all say the same wrong number, or each say a different wrong number. But the question is, given that there are 8 liars, and each can choose any number except 8, how many different answers will I get?\n\nI think I need to consider that the liars can choose any number except 8, but they don't have to choose different numbers. So, it's possible that all liars say the same wrong number, or they say different wrong numbers.\n\nBut the question is, how many different answers will I get? So, it depends on what numbers the liars choose.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at it differently. The truth-tellers will all say \"8.\" The liars can say any number except \"8.\" So, the possible answers are \"8\" from the truth-tellers and any other number from the liars.\n\nBut the question is, how many different answers will I get? So, if all liars say the same number, then I would get two different answers: \"8\" and whatever number the liars choose. But if the liars say different numbers, then I would get more different answers.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how the liars choose their numbers, just that they lie. So, they can choose any number except 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of different answers I get could be:\n\n- \"8\" from the truth-tellers.\n\n- Plus, any number that the liars choose, as long as it's not 8.\n\nBut since the liars can choose any number except 8, and there are infinitely many numbers, in theory, there could be infinitely many different answers.\n\nWait, but probably, the context is that the question is about how many different specific answers are possible, but that seems too broad.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liars can only choose integers, and perhaps only non-negative integers, since we're talking about counting people.\n\nAssuming that, then the possible answers from the liars are integers except 8.\n\nSo, possible answers are all integers except 8, plus the truth-tellers saying 8.\n\nBut again, that would still be infinitely many possible answers, since integers include negative numbers and zero.\n\nBut in the context of counting liars in a room, negative numbers don't make sense. So, perhaps the liars can only choose non-negative integers except 8.\n\nBut still, there are infinitely many non-negative integers except 8.\n\nBut that seems unrealistic for the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the liars can only choose numbers that are possible counts given the total number of people.\n\nSo, in the room, there are 20 people, 12 truth-tellers and 8 liars. So, the possible counts of liars range from 0 to 20.\n\nWait, but we know there are 8 liars, but the liars will lie about that.\n\nSo, the liars will choose any number except 8, but a number that could plausibly be the count of liars, which would be from 0 to 20, excluding 8.\n\nSo, possible answers from liars are integers from 0 to 20, except 8.\n\nTherefore, the possible answers are:\n\n- \"8\" from truth-tellers.\n\n- And any integer from 0 to 20, except 8, from the liars.\n\nSo, in total, the possible answers are all integers from 0 to 20, inclusive.\n\nBecause \"8\" is included from the truth-tellers, and the liars can say any other number from 0 to 20.\n\nWait, but the liars can't say 8, by definition.\n\nBut the truth-tellers will say 8.\n\nSo, the possible answers are:\n\n- \"8\" (from truth-tellers)\n\n- And any number from 0 to 20, except 8 (from liars)\n\nTherefore, the set of possible answers is all integers from 0 to 20, inclusive.\n\nBut wait, that includes 8, which comes only from truth-tellers, and the liars can say any other number.\n\nSo, the total number of different possible answers is 21 (since 0 to 20 is 21 different numbers).\n\nBut perhaps the liars can say numbers outside of 0 to 20, like negative numbers or numbers greater than 20, but in the context of counting people, that seems unlikely.\n\nSo, assuming that answers are non-negative integers up to 20, then the possible answers are 0 through 20, which is 21 different answers.\n\nBut, in reality, the truth-tellers will only say 8, and the liars will say anything except 8.\n\nSo, the actual answers I get will be:\n\n- \"8\" from the truth-tellers.\n\n- And various other numbers from the liars, but not 8.\n\nSo, the number of different answers depends on how many different numbers the liars choose.\n\nBut the problem asks for how many different answers I will get, not considering the sources, just the distinct values.\n\nGiven that, and without knowing how the liars choose their numbers, it seems like the possible answers are all integers from 0 to 20, except that 8 is only from truth-tellers and liars can't choose it.\n\nBut wait, the liars can choose 8, but they don't, because they always lie, and there are 8 liars, so saying \"8\" would be telling the truth, which they can't do.\n\nWait, no. The question is, how many liars are in the room. There are 8 liars. So, if a liar says \"8,\" they would be telling the truth, which they can't do because they always lie.\n\nTherefore, liars cannot say \"8,\" because that would be telling the truth.\n\nSo, liars must choose any number except 8.\n\nNow, assuming that answers are non-negative integers up to 20, the possible answers are 0 to 20, except 8, from the liars, and 8 from the truth-tellers.\n\nTherefore, the set of possible answers is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20} from the liars, and 8 from the truth-tellers.\n\nSo, overall, the possible answers are {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20}, which is 21 different answers.\n\nBut, in reality, since truth-tellers will only say 8, and liars will say anything except 8, the actual answers I get will be 8 from truth-tellers and some subset of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20} from the liars.\n\nBut the question is, how many different answers will I get?\n\nGiven that, and without knowing how the liars choose their answers, it's possible that all liars choose the same number, different from 8, giving me two different answers: 8 and whatever the liars say.\n\nOr, if each liar chooses a different number, I could get up to 20 different answers: 8 plus 19 other numbers.\n\nBut the problem likely expects me to consider that the liars can choose any number except 8, and potentially choose different numbers.\n\nTherefore, the number of different answers I will get is the number of distinct numbers chosen by the liars plus the number \"8\" from the truth-tellers.\n\nBut since the liars can choose any numbers except 8, and there are 8 liars, the number of different answers can range from 1 to 19, depending on how many distinct numbers the liars choose.\n\nBut the problem asks for \"how many different answers will you get?\", implying a single number, not a range.\n\nSo, perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the liars all choose the same number, different from 8, and the truth-tellers all say 8, so I get two different answers: 8 and whatever the liars say.\n\nBut the problem states that there are 8 liars and 12 truth-tellers, and I'm asking how many different answers I will get.\n\nWait, perhaps the liars all say the same wrong number, and the truth-tellers all say 8, so I get two different answers.\n\nBut the problem is about how many different answers I will get, and it seems like the answer should be two: one from the truth-tellers and one from the liars.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that liars could choose different numbers, leading to more than two different answers.\n\nHowever, perhaps in this scenario, all liars choose the same wrong number, leading to only two different answers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the liars each choose a different wrong number, leading to more different answers.\n\nBut without specification, perhaps the assumption is that all liars say the same wrong number.\n\nIn that case, I would get two different answers: 8 from truth-tellers and one other number from the liars.\n\nTherefore, the number of different answers I will get is two.\n\nBut I feel like there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liars will say different numbers, leading to multiple different answers.\n\nBut the problem asks for \"how many different answers will you get?\", and it seems like it should be a specific number.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider that the truth-tellers will all say \"8,\" and the liars will say any number except \"8.\" But the question is, how many different answers will I get?\n\nWell, the truth-tellers give one answer: \"8.\"\n\nThe liars give answers that are not \"8.\" But the problem doesn't specify what numbers the liars choose or whether they all choose the same number or different numbers.\n\nHowever, since the liars are lying, and they know there are 8 liars, they would likely choose numbers that are different from 8, but they could choose any other number.\n\nSo, if all liars choose the same wrong number, say \"10,\" then I would get two different answers: \"8\" and \"10.\"\n\nBut if each liar chooses a different wrong number, then I could get up to 19 different wrong answers (assuming answers are integers from 0 to 20, excluding 8), plus the \"8\" from truth-tellers, totaling 20 different answers.\n\nBut the problem likely expects that the liars all choose the same wrong number, leading to only two different answers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think about it in terms of possible responses.\n\n- Truth-tellers will always say \"8.\"\n\n- Liars will say anything except \"8.\"\n\nSo, the set of possible answers is \"8\" and any other number.\n\nBut in the context of the problem, it's reasonable to assume that answers are non-negative integers up to the total number of people in the room, which is 20.\n\nTherefore, possible answers are integers from 0 to 20, except that liars won't say \"8.\"\n\nSo, possible answers are {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20} from liars, and \"8\" from truth-tellers.\n\nTherefore, the total possible distinct answers are 21 (0 through 20), because \"8\" is included only from truth-tellers, and liars can say any of the other 20 numbers.\n\nBut, in reality, the liars might not choose all 20 other numbers; they could choose a subset of them.\n\nBut the question is, how many different answers will I get?\n\nGiven that, and without specifying how the liars choose their answers, it's unclear.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem assumes that each person gives a unique answer, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the liars all give the same wrong answer, in which case I would get only two different answers: \"8\" from truth-tellers and one other number from liars.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liars will each choose a different wrong number, leading to many different answers.\n\nBut again, without specification, it's hard to tell.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is that I will get two different answers: \"8\" from truth-tellers and one other number from liars.\n\nBut I suspect there's a more precise way to think about it.\n\nLet me consider that the liars can see everyone else and know who are liars and who are truth-tellers.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify what the liars know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liars don't know who are liars and who are truth-tellers, so they don't know that there are 8 liars.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liars know that there are 8 liars, but since they lie, they can't say \"8.\"\n\nSo, they have to choose a number different from 8.\n\nTherefore, each liar will choose a number\u22608.\n\nNow, if all liars choose the same wrong number, say \"10,\" then I would get two different answers: \"8\" and \"10.\"\n\nBut if liars choose different wrong numbers, then I would get more different answers.\n\nBut without knowing how the liars choose their numbers, it's indeterminate how many different answers I will get.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem assumes that all liars choose the same wrong number, leading to only two different answers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard solution to this type of problem.\n\nLet me consider that the liars will all give the same wrong answer, and truth-tellers give the correct answer.\n\nIn that case, I would get two different answers: \"8\" from truth-tellers and one other number from liars.\n\nTherefore, the number of different answers I will get is two.\n\nBut I feel like this is simplifying the problem too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liars will choose different numbers, leading to multiple different answers.\n\nBut again, without specification, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the number of distinct answers that are possible, not the number I will get.\n\nBut the question says, \"how many different answers will you get?\" which implies the number of distinct answers received.\n\nBut without knowing how the liars choose their answers, it's hard to pin down.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that I will get two different answers: one correct answer from truth-tellers and one wrong answer from liars.\n\nBut if liars choose different wrong answers, then I could get more than two different answers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the context of the problem, it's assumed that liars all give the same wrong answer.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be two.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to determine the number of different answers based on the number of truth-tellers and liars.\n\nBut I don't see it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that I will get only one answer, which is \"8,\" because the liars, by lying, would deny that there are 8 liars, but the truth-tellers will say \"8,\" and their statements are truthful.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because liars will give incorrect answers, which would be different from \"8.\"\n\nTherefore, I would get at least two different answers: \"8\" and whatever the liars say.\n\nBut again, if liars choose different numbers, I could get multiple different answers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that only two answers are possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that I will get only one answer, which is \"8,\" because the liars, by lying, would give answers that contradict each other, making their answers invalid.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the truth-tellers will say \"8,\" and the liars will say \"There are not 8 liars,\" which could be interpreted as any number except 8.\n\nBut again, without knowing specifically what numbers they choose, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this context, liars will all converge on a single wrong number, leading to only two different answers.\n\nBut I'm still not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that I will get only one answer, which is \"8,\" because the liars cannot agree on a single number, leading to their answers being dismissed.\n\nBut that seems like an assumption not supported by the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have only two different answers: \"8\" from truth-tellers and \"7\" from liars.\n\nBut why \"7\"? There's no particular reason to choose \"7.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps liars will say \"9,\" suggesting one more liar to mislead.\n\nBut again, without specification, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liars will say \"0,\" denying the presence of any liars.\n\nBut again, that's just one possible wrong answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liars will say \"12,\" claiming that all are truth-tellers.\n\nBut again, that's just another possible wrong answer.\n\nThe point is, liars can choose any number except 8, and without knowing their choices, it's indeterminate how many different answers I will get.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is that I will get two different answers: \"8\" from truth-tellers and one other number from liars.\n\nBut if liars choose different numbers, then I could get more than two different answers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be two, assuming that liars all choose the same wrong number.\n\nGiven that, I will go with two different answers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
