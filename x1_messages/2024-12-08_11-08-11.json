        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B in 2 hours, and the distance is 100 miles. That means its speed going from A to B is 100 miles divided by 2 hours, which is 50 miles per hour. Got it.\n\nNow, it returns from Town B to Town A at half its original speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. So, on the way back, the train is going at 25 miles per hour.\n\nTo find out how long the return trip takes, I need to divide the distance by the speed. So, 100 miles divided by 25 miles per hour should give me the time for the return trip.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 100 divided by 25 is 4. So, the return trip takes 4 hours.\n\nThe entire round trip is the time to go from A to B plus the time to go back from B to A. That's 2 hours plus 4 hours, which equals 6 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check. The train goes from A to B at 50 mph, taking 2 hours. Then it returns at 25 mph, taking 4 hours. So, total time is indeed 6 hours.\n\nI think that makes sense. But maybe I should consider if there's any stoppage time or something, but the question doesn't mention any, so probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the average speed for the entire trip, but the question is asking for the total time, not the average speed.\n\nSo, the entire round trip takes 6 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
