        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 people in the room, including Mary, and each person knows exactly 3 other people in the room. Also, none of these people have any common friends. Hmmm. So, I need to figure out how many people Mary knows.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means that each person knows exactly 3 other people, and that none of them have any common friends. If each person knows exactly 3 others, it sounds like a graph where each vertex has a degree of 3. In graph theory, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.\n\nSo, if we imagine this situation as a graph, where each person is a vertex, and an edge between two vertices means that those two people know each other, then we have a 10-vertex graph where each vertex has degree 3.\n\nNow, the additional condition is that none of these people have any common friends. That means, for any two vertices that are connected by an edge, they don't share any common neighbors. In other words, if A knows B, and A knows C, then B and C don't know each other.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit tricky. If A knows B, C, and D, and none of B, C, D know each other, then A is the only connection between B, C, and D.\n\nBut the problem says that none of these people have any common friends. So, for any person, their friends don't know each other. That makes sense.\n\nSo, in this graph, it's a 10-vertex graph where each vertex has degree 3, and for any two adjacent vertices, they have no common neighbors.\n\nI need to find out how many people Mary knows. But the problem says that each person knows exactly 3 other people, so, doesn't that mean Mary knows exactly 3 people?\n\nWait, but the question is: \"how many people does Mary know?\" And it says each person knows exactly 3 other people. So, isn't the answer just 3?\n\nBut then, why is the condition about no common friends included? Maybe it's to make sure that the graph is constructed in a specific way.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the condition that none of these people have any common friends implies something about the structure of the graph.\n\nLet me consider Mary and the three people she knows. Let's call them A, B, and C. According to the condition, A, B, and C don't know each other. So, Mary is the only connection between them.\n\nNow, each of A, B, and C also knows two other people besides Mary, since they each have degree 3.\n\nLet's consider A. A knows Mary and two others. Let's call them D and E. Similarly, B knows Mary and two others, say F and G, and C knows Mary and two others, say H and I.\n\nNow, none of A, B, C know each other, and none of D, E, F, G, H, I know A, B, or C except through Mary.\n\nWait, but D and E are friends of A, so they shouldn't know A's other friends, which are Mary, B, and C. But wait, A only knows Mary, D, and E. So, D and E don't know B or C.\n\nSimilarly, F and G are friends of B, so they don't know A or C.\n\nAnd H and I are friends of C, so they don't know A or B.\n\nBut what about the connections between D, E, F, G, H, I? Could they know each other?\n\nWell, since none of the people have common friends, and D and E are both friends of A, they don't know each other.\n\nSimilarly, F and G don't know each other, and H and I don't know each other.\n\nBut what about D and F, or D and H, etc.? The condition only says that none of these people have any common friends, meaning that if two people know the same person, they don't know each other.\n\nBut in this case, D and F don't know any common people, because D knows A and E, and F knows B and G. So, they don't know each other.\n\nSimilarly, D and H don't know each other, since D knows A and E, and H knows C and I.\n\nSo, in this setup, it seems like the graph is composed of Mary in the center, knowing A, B, and C, and each of A, B, and C knows two others who don't know anyone else in the group.\n\nBut wait, there are 10 people in total. So, Mary, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I are all distinct.\n\nWait, but in this setup, Mary knows A, B, and C, and A knows Mary, D, and E; B knows Mary, F, and G; C knows Mary, H, and I; D knows A and E; E knows A and D; F knows B and G; G knows B and F; H knows C and I; I knows C and H.\n\nSo, everyone knows exactly 2 or 3 people, as per their degrees.\n\nBut the problem says that each person knows exactly 3 other people, but in this setup, D, E, F, G, H, I only know 2 people each.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the graph.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the graph is such that Mary knows A, B, and C; A knows Mary, D, and E; D knows A and F; E knows A and G; F knows D and H; G knows E and I; H knows F and J; I knows G and J; J knows H and I.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a 10-vertex graph where each vertex has degree 3, and the graph is a union of disjoint 5-cycles, but with degree 3, that might not work.\n\nWait, but the condition is that no two adjacent vertices have any common neighbors.\n\nIn graph theory, a graph where no two adjacent vertices have any common neighbors is called a triangle-free graph, but actually, more specifically, it's a graph with no triangles and no diamonds.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, it's stronger than just being triangle-free, because in a triangle-free graph, no three vertices form a triangle, but here, for any two adjacent vertices, they have no common neighbors.\n\nThis is a graph with girth at least 4, meaning the shortest cycle has length at least 4.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a cubic graph, which is a 3-regular graph, meaning each vertex has degree 3.\n\nAnd with the additional condition that no two adjacent vertices have common neighbors, which might be a specific type of cubic graph.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a cubic graph with girth at least 4.\n\nWait, but in cubic graphs, it's possible to have triangles, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a cubic graph with girth at least 5, meaning no cycles of length less than 5.\n\nIn that case, it would satisfy the condition that no two adjacent vertices have common neighbors.\n\nWait, in a cubic graph with girth at least 4, no two adjacent vertices have common neighbors.\n\nBecause if two adjacent vertices had a common neighbor, that would form a triangle, which is a cycle of length 3.\n\nBut in a graph with girth at least 4, there are no cycles of length 3, so no triangles.\n\nTherefore, in such a graph, no two adjacent vertices have common neighbors.\n\nSo, perhaps this graph has girth at least 4.\n\nBut in any case, the problem seems to be leading me to consider a specific type of graph.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way to approach this problem without delving too deep into graph theory.\n\nLet me try to count the total number of edges in the graph.\n\nIn a graph with 10 vertices, each of degree 3, the total number of edges is (10 * 3)/2 = 15.\n\nSo, there are 15 edges in the graph.\n\nNow, the condition is that no two adjacent vertices have common neighbors.\n\nI wonder if this imposes any restrictions on the number of people Mary knows.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each person knows exactly 3 other people, and none of these people have any common friends.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem: \"each person knows exactly 3 other people in the room. If we know that none of these people have any common friends, how many people does Mary know?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the phrase \"none of these people have any common friends\" refers to the entire group, meaning that no two people in the room have a common friend.\n\nBut that seems odd, because if each person knows exactly 3 others, then their friends are connected to them, but not necessarily to each other.\n\nWait, but in the earlier interpretation, if A knows Mary, B, and C, and B knows Mary, F, and G, then A and B both know Mary, so they have a common friend, which is Mary.\n\nBut the problem says that none of these people have any common friends, meaning that no two people share a common friend.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted that.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Each person knows exactly 3 other people in the room. If we know that none of these people have any common friends, how many people does Mary know?\"\n\nPerhaps it's better to interpret it as: for any person, their friends do not know each other.\n\nIn other words, if A knows B and C, then B and C do not know each other.\n\nThat seems consistent with the earlier interpretation.\n\nSo, in graph terms, the graph is triangle-free, or more specifically, it's a 3-regular graph with girth at least 4.\n\nBut in any case, the question is: how many people does Mary know?\n\nBut the problem already states that each person knows exactly 3 other people, so wouldn't Mary know exactly 3 people?\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick here, and the condition imposes further restrictions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition makes the situation impossible, leading to Mary knowing 0 people.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition forces Mary to know a different number of people.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the total number of friendships and the constraints imposed by the condition.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose Mary knows A, B, and C.\n\nThen, A, B, and C do not know each other, by the condition.\n\nNow, A knows Mary and two others, say D and E.\n\nSimilarly, B knows Mary and two others, say F and G, and C knows Mary and two others, say H and I.\n\nNow, D and E do not know A's other friends, which are Mary, B, and C, so they don't know Mary, B, or C.\n\nSimilarly, F and G don't know Mary, A, or C, and H and I don't know Mary, A, or B.\n\nNow, D knows A and E, and E knows A and D.\n\nSimilarly, F knows B and G, G knows B and F, H knows C and I, and I knows C and H.\n\nNow, none of D, E, F, G, H, I know each other, because if, say, D and F knew each other, then D and F would both know A and B, but A and B don't know each other, which doesn't violate the condition directly, but perhaps indirectly.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that no two people have any common friends.\n\nWait, but in this setup, D and E are both friends of A, but they don't know each other, which satisfies the condition that A's friends don't know each other.\n\nSimilarly, F and G don't know each other, and H and I don't know each other.\n\nNow, what about D and F? Do they have any common friends?\n\nD knows A and E, F knows B and G.\n\nSo, D and F don't know each other, and they don't have any common friends, since A doesn't know B, E doesn't know G, etc.\n\nSimilarly, D and H don't know each other, and don't have any common friends.\n\nSo, this setup seems to satisfy the condition that no two people have any common friends.\n\nBut in this case, Mary knows 3 people, which is consistent with the initial statement.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to arrange this graph such that Mary knows more or fewer people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition forces Mary to know exactly 3 people.\n\nWait, but the problem states that each person knows exactly 3 other people, so Mary must know exactly 3 people.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here, and the condition makes it impossible for Mary to know exactly 3 people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition forces Mary to know a different number of people.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the total number of friendships and see if it's possible.\n\nLet me consider that in a group of 10 people, each knowing exactly 3 others, with no two people having common friends.\n\nSo, as I've set up earlier, Mary knows A, B, and C; A knows Mary, D, and E; B knows Mary, F, and G; C knows Mary, H, and I; D knows A and E; E knows A and D; F knows B and G; G knows B and F; H knows C and I; I knows C and H.\n\nSo, in this setup, we have Mary knowing 3 people, and the others knowing 2 or 3 people as per their degrees.\n\nBut earlier, I realized that D, E, F, G, H, I only know 2 people each, which contradicts the initial condition that each person knows exactly 3 people.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the graph.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nSuppose Mary knows A, B, and C.\n\nA knows Mary, D, and E.\n\nB knows Mary, F, and G.\n\nC knows Mary, H, and I.\n\nNow, D knows A and, say, F.\n\nWait, but if D knows A and F, then A and F have a common friend, which is D, but A and F are not directly connected.\n\nWait, no, A and F don't know each other, but D knows both A and F.\n\nBut the condition is that no two people have any common friends.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up.\n\nLet me try to rephrase.\n\nThe condition is that no two people have any common friends.\n\nSo, for any two people, say X and Y, if they both know Z, then Z is their only common friend.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"none of these people have any common friends\", which could mean that for any two people, they don't share any common friends.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because if X knows Z and Y knows Z, then Z is a common friend of X and Y.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem means that no two people share more than one common friend.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"none of these people have any common friends\", which is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it means that for any two people who know each other, they don't have any common friends besides each other.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that no two adjacent vertices have any common neighbors besides each other.\n\nBut in the earlier interpretation, that would mean the graph has no triangles.\n\nBut in this case, the graph would have girth at least 4.\n\nBut in any case, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that each person knows exactly 3 others, and the graph is 3-regular, and that no two adjacent vertices have common neighbors, which is a specific type of graph.\n\nIn such a graph, is it possible to have a 3-regular graph on 10 vertices with no two adjacent vertices having common neighbors?\n\nI'm not sure, but perhaps such a graph exists.\n\nIn any case, the problem seems to be leading me to conclude that Mary knows exactly 3 people, as per the initial condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition makes it impossible for such a graph to exist, in which case Mary knows 0 people.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition forces Mary to know a different number of people.\n\nBut given the constraints, it's hard to see how.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that Mary knows 3 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
