        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to figure out how many employees are currently working in each department.\n\nThe company has 120 employees in total, and 60% of them work in the sales department. So, to find the number of sales employees, we calculate 60% of 120:\n\nSales employees = 60% of 120 = 0.60 * 120 = 72 employees\n\nNow, the remaining employees work in the production department. So, production employees would be the total employees minus the sales employees:\n\nProduction employees = Total employees - Sales employees = 120 - 72 = 48 employees\n\nOkay, so right now, there are 48 employees in production.\n\nNow, the company is planning to hire an additional 20 employees, and all of them will work in the production department. So, after hiring, the number of production employees will be:\n\nNew production employees = Current production employees + New hires = 48 + 20 = 68 employees\n\nThe total workforce after hiring will be the original 120 employees plus the 20 new hires:\n\nTotal workforce after hiring = 120 + 20 = 140 employees\n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of this new total workforce is working in production. So, we'll calculate the percentage of production employees out of the total workforce after hiring:\n\nPercentage in production = (Production employees / Total workforce after hiring) * 100 = (68 / 140) * 100\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, divide 68 by 140:\n\n68 \u00f7 140 = 0.4857 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.4857 * 100 = 48.57%\n\nSo, after hiring the additional 20 employees for production, approximately 48.57% of the total workforce will be working in the production department.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check those calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the original number of employees: 120\n\n60% in sales: 0.60 * 120 = 72\n\nSo, production employees: 120 - 72 = 48\n\nAfter hiring 20 more for production: 48 + 20 = 68\n\nTotal workforce after hiring: 120 + 20 = 140\n\nPercentage in production: (68 / 140) * 100\n\nLet me do the division again: 68 divided by 140 equals 0.4857142857...\n\nMultiplying by 100: 48.57142857...%\n\nSo, yes, approximately 48.57%.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48.57\\%} \\]"
