        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a PowerShell script that gathers details about network interfaces on a Windows system. Specifically, I need to get IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, DNS servers, and MAC addresses. Sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure I cover all the bases.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what cmdlets in PowerShell can help me retrieve this information. I recall that the `Get-NetAdapter` cmdlet can give me details about network adapters, and `Get-NetIPConfiguration` can provide IP configuration details. Maybe I can combine these to get all the required information.\n\nLet me start by exploring `Get-NetIPConfiguration`. When I run this cmdlet without any parameters, it shows IP configuration for all network interfaces. It displays the interface alias, connection status, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, default gateway, and DNS servers. That's pretty useful.\n\nBut I also need the MAC address, which I think is part of the network adapter's properties. So, perhaps I can use `Get-NetAdapter` to get the MAC address and combine it with the IP configuration data.\n\nI should think about how to structure the script. Maybe I can get a list of all network interfaces and then for each interface, collect all the relevant information.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Get a list of all network interfaces.\n\n2. For each interface, retrieve:\n\na. Interface name or alias\n\nb. IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6)\n\nc. Subnet masks\n\nd. Default gateways\n\ne. DNS servers\n\nf. MAC address\n\nI need to consider that some interfaces might not have IP addresses assigned, or they might have multiple IP addresses. So, the script should handle these scenarios gracefully.\n\nAlso, I should think about the output format. Maybe create a custom object for each interface with properties for each piece of information, and then output a list of these objects. That way, it's easy to read and manipulate if needed.\n\nLet me consider how to get the subnet mask. From what I remember, subnet masks are part of the IP address configuration, so they should be available along with the IP addresses.\n\nDefault gateways are usually set per interface, but sometimes multiple gateways can be configured. I need to capture all of them if present.\n\nDNS servers can be configured per interface as well, so I need to retrieve all DNS servers assigned to each interface.\n\nMAC addresses are part of the network adapter's physical properties, so I'll get that from `Get-NetAdapter`.\n\nI should also handle any errors or exceptions that might occur when retrieving this information, like permissions issues or inaccessible network adapters.\n\nLet me think about how to map the information from `Get-NetIPConfiguration` and `Get-NetAdapter`. Probably, I can match them based on the interface name or index.\n\nMaybe I can get the interface index from `Get-NetIPConfiguration` and use that to get the corresponding adapter's MAC address from `Get-NetAdapter`.\n\nI need to test this approach on different Windows systems to ensure compatibility.\n\nAlso, I should consider that not all interfaces might have a MAC address, like loopback interfaces. So, I need to handle those cases appropriately.\n\nLet me sketch a rough script structure:\n\n```\n\n# Get all network interfaces\n\n$interfaces = Get-NetIPConfiguration\n\nforeach ($interface in $interfaces) {\n\n# Get interface name\n\n$interfaceName = $interface.InterfaceAlias\n\n# Get IP addresses\n\n$ipv4Addresses = $interface.IPv4Address\n\n$ipv6Addresses = $interface.IPv6Address\n\n# Get subnet masks (from IPv4 configuration)\n\n$subnetMasks = $interface.IPv4Subnet\n\n# Get default gateways\n\n$defaultGateways = $interface.IpDefaultGateway\n\n# Get DNS servers\n\n$dnsServers = $interface.DNSServer\n\n# Get MAC address using interface index\n\n$adapter = Get-NetAdapter -InterfaceIndex $interface.InterfaceIndex\n\n$macAddress = $adapter.MacAddress\n\n# Create a custom object with all the information\n\n$interfaceInfo = New-Object PSObject -Property @{\n\nInterfaceName = $interfaceName\n\nIPv4Addresses = $ipv4Addresses\n\nIPv6Addresses = $ipv6Addresses\n\nSubnetMasks = $subnetMasks\n\nDefaultGateways = $defaultGateways\n\nDnsServers = $dnsServers\n\nMacAddress = $macAddress\n\n}\n\n# Output the object\n\n$interfaceInfo\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. Now, I need to test this script and see if it retrieves the correct information.\n\nI should also think about formatting the output for better readability. For example, listing IP addresses and DNS servers as comma-separated strings instead of arrays.\n\nAdditionally, I can add some error handling to manage cases where certain information is not available.\n\nLet me consider using `Select-Object` to create a more structured output.\n\nMaybe something like this:\n\n```\n\n$interfaceInfo = [PSCustomObject]@{\n\nInterfaceName = $interfaceName\n\nIPv4Addresses = ($ipv4Addresses | ForEach-Object { $_.IpAddress }) -join ', '\n\nIPv6Addresses = ($ipv6Addresses | ForEach-Object { $_.IpAddress }) -join ', '\n\nSubnetMasks = ($subnetMasks | ForEach-Object { $_.PrefixLength }) -join ', '\n\nDefaultGateways = ($defaultGateways | ForEach-Object { $_.NextHop }) -join ', '\n\nDnsServers = ($dnsServers | ForEach-Object { $_.ServerAddress }) -join ', '\n\nMacAddress = $macAddress\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis way, the output is more readable, with addresses listed as comma-separated strings.\n\nI should also handle cases where there are no IP addresses or DNS servers assigned.\n\nLet me think about how to display subnet masks. In IP configuration, subnet masks are often represented as CIDR prefixes (e.g., /24 for 255.255.255.0). Should I convert these to the dotted decimal format?\n\nMaybe I can add an option to choose the format, but to keep it simple, I'll stick with CIDR for now.\n\nAlso, for default gateways, I need to display the next hop IP address.\n\nI should make sure that all properties are present, even if they are empty or null.\n\nLet me consider adding some comments to the script for clarity.\n\nAlso, I can add a header or a description at the beginning of the script to explain its purpose.\n\nPerhaps I can format the output as a table for better readability when run in the PowerShell console.\n\nAlternatively, I can export the output to a CSV file for easier analysis or reporting.\n\nWait, the user might want to use this script in different ways, so maybe I can add parameters to choose the output format, like console output or CSV file.\n\nThat sounds like a good idea.\n\nLet me think about how to implement that.\n\nI can use PowerShell's `Param` to define parameters for the script, such as `-OutputFormat` with possible values like 'Console' or 'CSV', and maybe `-FilePath` if the output format is CSV.\n\nSo, the script can accept these parameters and based on the input, either display the output in the console or save it to a specified CSV file.\n\nI need to validate the output format parameter to ensure it's one of the accepted values.\n\nAlso, if the output format is CSV and the file path is not specified, I can set a default file path, like 'network_interfaces.csv' in the current directory.\n\nI should also handle cases where the file already exists, maybe by overwriting it or appending to it.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll set the script to overwrite the file if it already exists.\n\nLet me adjust the script structure accordingly.\n\nHere's an updated outline:\n\n```\n\nParam(\n\n[ValidateSet('Console','CSV')]\n\n[string]$OutputFormat = 'Console',\n\n[string]$FilePath = 'network_interfaces.csv'\n\n)\n\n# Get all network interfaces\n\n$interfaces = Get-NetIPConfiguration\n\nforeach ($interface in $interfaces) {\n\n# Retrieve interface details as before\n\n# ...\n\n# Create custom object\n\n$interfaceInfo = [PSCustomObject]@{\n\nInterfaceName = $interfaceName\n\nIPv4Addresses = ($ipv4Addresses | ForEach-Object { $_.IpAddress }) -join ', '\n\nIPv6Addresses = ($ipv6Addresses | ForEach-Object { $_.IpAddress }) -join ', '\n\nSubnetMasks = ($subnetMasks | ForEach-Object { $_.PrefixLength }) -join ', '\n\nDefaultGateways = ($defaultGateways | ForEach-Object { $_.NextHop }) -join ', '\n\nDnsServers = ($dnsServers | ForEach-Object { $_.ServerAddress }) -join ', '\n\nMacAddress = $macAddress\n\n}\n\n# Collect all interface info objects in an array\n\n$allInterfaceInfo += $interfaceInfo\n\n}\n\n# Based on OutputFormat, either display in console or export to CSV\n\nif ($OutputFormat -eq 'Console') {\n\n$allInterfaceInfo | Format-Table -AutoSize\n\n} elseif ($OutputFormat -eq 'CSV') {\n\n$allInterfaceInfo | Export-Csv -Path $FilePath -NoTypeInformation\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems solid. Now, I need to test this script on a Windows system to ensure it works as expected.\n\nI should check different scenarios, such as:\n\n- Interfaces with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\n\n- Interfaces with multiple IP addresses\n\n- Interfaces with no IP addresses assigned\n\n- Interfaces with default gateways set\n\n- Interfaces with DNS servers set\n\n- Interfaces without MAC addresses (like loopback)\n\nI need to make sure that the script handles all these cases without errors.\n\nAlso, I should verify that the output is accurate and formatted correctly.\n\nLet me also consider localizing the script. Maybe some property names or values differ based on the system's language settings. I need to ensure that the script is not dependent on any specific language.\n\nTo do that, I can use the cmdlets' default properties and avoid hardcoding any strings that might change based on locale.\n\nI believe PowerShell cmdlets return consistent property names regardless of the system's language, so that should be fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is running the script with sufficient permissions. Some network configuration details might require administrative privileges. I should include a note in the script reminding the user to run it as an administrator if necessary.\n\nLet me add a check at the beginning of the script to verify if the script is running with administrative privileges and display a message if not.\n\nHere's how I can do that:\n\n```\n\n# Check for administrative privileges\n\n$currentPrincipal = New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent())\n\nif (-not $currentPrincipal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)) {\n\nWrite-Warning \"This script requires administrative privileges to run. Please run as administrator.\"\n\nexit\n\n}\n\n```\n\nI'll add this at the beginning of the script.\n\nNow, I need to think about error handling within the script. For example, if `Get-NetIPConfiguration` fails for some reason, or if there are issues retrieving the MAC address.\n\nI can wrap the retrieval commands in try-catch blocks to catch any exceptions and handle them gracefully, perhaps by logging an error message and skipping that interface.\n\nBut to keep the script simple, maybe just include basic error handling and output any errors to the console.\n\nLet me consider using `Try` and `Catch` for the main retrieval operations.\n\nHere's an updated script structure with error handling:\n\n```\n\nParam(\n\n[ValidateSet('Console','CSV')]\n\n[string]$OutputFormat = 'Console',\n\n[string]$FilePath = 'network_interfaces.csv'\n\n)\n\n# Check for administrative privileges\n\n$currentPrincipal = New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent())\n\nif (-not $currentPrincipal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)) {\n\nWrite-Warning \"This script requires administrative privileges to run. Please run as administrator.\"\n\nexit\n\n}\n\n# Get all network interfaces\n\n$interfaces = Get-NetIPConfiguration\n\nforeach ($interface in $interfaces) {\n\nTry {\n\n# Retrieve interface details\n\n$interfaceName = $interface.InterfaceAlias\n\n$ipv4Addresses = $interface.IPv4Address\n\n$ipv6Addresses = $interface.IPv6Address\n\n$subnetMasks = $interface.IPv4Subnet\n\n$defaultGateways = $interface.IpDefaultGateway\n\n$dnsServers = $interface.DNSServer\n\n$adapter = Get-NetAdapter -InterfaceIndex $interface.InterfaceIndex\n\n$macAddress = $adapter.MacAddress\n\n# Create custom object\n\n$interfaceInfo = [PSCustomObject]@{\n\nInterfaceName = $interfaceName\n\nIPv4Addresses = ($ipv4Addresses | ForEach-Object { $_.IpAddress }) -join ', '\n\nIPv6Addresses = ($ipv6Addresses | ForEach-Object { $_.IpAddress }) -join ', '\n\nSubnetMasks = ($subnetMasks | ForEach-Object { $_.PrefixLength }) -join ', '\n\nDefaultGateways = ($defaultGateways | ForEach-Object { $_.NextHop }) -join ', '\n\nDnsServers = ($dnsServers | ForEach-Object { $_.ServerAddress }) -join ', '\n\nMacAddress = $macAddress\n\n}\n\n# Collect all interface info objects in an array\n\n$allInterfaceInfo += $interfaceInfo\n\n} Catch {\n\nWrite-Error \"Error retrieving information for interface $($interface.InterfaceAlias): $_\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n# Based on OutputFormat, either display in console or export to CSV\n\nif ($OutputFormat -eq 'Console') {\n\n$allInterfaceInfo | Format-Table -AutoSize\n\n} elseif ($OutputFormat -eq 'CSV') {\n\n$allInterfaceInfo | Export-Csv -Path $FilePath -NoTypeInformation\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis looks good. Now, I need to test this script in different environments to ensure its reliability.\n\nI should also consider optimizing the script for performance, especially if there are many network interfaces.\n\nUsing `Get-NetAdapter` inside a loop might not be efficient for a large number of interfaces. Maybe I can retrieve all adapters at once and then match them by interface index.\n\nLet me try to optimize that part.\n\nFirst, retrieve all adapters outside the loop:\n\n```\n\n$adapters = Get-NetAdapter\n\n```\n\nThen, inside the loop, use the interface index to select the corresponding adapter:\n\n```\n\n$adapter = $adapters | Where-Object { $_.InterfaceIndex -eq $interface.InterfaceIndex }\n\n$macAddress = $adapter.MacAddress\n\n```\n\nThis should be more efficient than calling `Get-NetAdapter` for each interface inside the loop.\n\nLet me update the script accordingly.\n\nAlso, I should handle cases where an adapter is not found for a particular interface index, which might happen if the interface is not a physical adapter.\n\nI can add a check to see if `$adapter` is null and set `$macAddress` to 'N/A' or something similar.\n\nHere's the revised script:\n\n```\n\nParam(\n\n[ValidateSet('Console','CSV')]\n\n[string]$OutputFormat = 'Console',\n\n[string]$FilePath = 'network_interfaces.csv'\n\n)\n\n# Check for administrative privileges\n\n$currentPrincipal = New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent())\n\nif (-not $currentPrincipal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)) {\n\nWrite-Warning \"This script requires administrative privileges to run. Please run as administrator.\"\n\nexit\n\n}\n\n# Get all network interfaces\n\n$interfaces = Get-NetIPConfiguration\n\n# Get all network adapters\n\n$adapters = Get-NetAdapter\n\n# Initialize array to hold interface information\n\n$allInterfaceInfo = @()\n\nforeach ($interface in $interfaces) {\n\nTry {\n\n# Retrieve interface details\n\n$interfaceName = $interface.InterfaceAlias\n\n$ipv4Addresses = $interface.IPv4Address\n\n$ipv6Addresses = $interface.IPv6Address\n\n$subnetMasks = $interface.IPv4Subnet\n\n$defaultGateways = $interface.IpDefaultGateway\n\n$dnsServers = $interface.DNSServer\n\n# Get corresponding adapter by InterfaceIndex\n\n$adapter = $adapters | Where-Object { $_.InterfaceIndex -eq $interface.InterfaceIndex }\n\n$macAddress = if ($adapter) { $adapter.MacAddress } else { 'N/A' }\n\n# Create custom object\n\n$interfaceInfo = [PSCustomObject]@{\n\nInterfaceName = $interfaceName\n\nIPv4Addresses = ($ipv4Addresses | ForEach-Object { $_.IpAddress }) -join ', '\n\nIPv6Addresses = ($ipv6Addresses | ForEach-Object { $_.IpAddress }) -join ', '\n\nSubnetMasks = ($subnetMasks | ForEach-Object { $_.PrefixLength }) -join ', '\n\nDefaultGateways = ($defaultGateways | ForEach-Object { $_.NextHop }) -join ', '\n\nDnsServers = ($dnsServers | ForEach-Object { $_.ServerAddress }) -join ', '\n\nMacAddress = $macAddress\n\n}\n\n# Add to the array\n\n$allInterfaceInfo += $interfaceInfo\n\n} Catch {\n\nWrite-Error \"Error retrieving information for interface $($interface.InterfaceAlias): $_\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n# Based on OutputFormat, either display in console or export to CSV\n\nif ($OutputFormat -eq 'Console') {\n\n$allInterfaceInfo | Format-Table -AutoSize\n\n} elseif ($OutputFormat -eq 'CSV') {\n\n$allInterfaceInfo | Export-Csv -Path $FilePath -NoTypeInformation\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis should work efficiently and handle various scenarios.\n\nI should also consider adding comments to the script for better understanding and maintainability.\n\nLet me add some comments explaining each section of the script.\n\nFinally, I need to test the script on a Windows system to verify that it retrieves the correct information and handles different cases appropriately.\n\nI should also check if the CSV output is correctly formatted and if the table output in the console is readable.\n\nOnce I'm satisfied with the testing, I can consider the script complete.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo retrieve information about network interfaces on a Windows system, including IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, DNS servers, and MAC addresses, you can use the following PowerShell script.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```powershell\nParam(\n    [ValidateSet('Console','CSV')]\n    [string]$OutputFormat = 'Console',\n    [string]$FilePath = 'network_interfaces.csv'\n)\n\n# Check for administrative privileges\n$currentPrincipal = New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent())\nif (-not $currentPrincipal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)) {\n    Write-Warning \"This script requires administrative privileges to run.
