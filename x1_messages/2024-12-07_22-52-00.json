        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that normally produces 500 widgets per hour, but there's a malfunction that causes the production rate to decrease by 5% each hour. We need to find out how many widgets are produced over an 8-hour shift.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 5% decrease in production rate means. If the factory produces 500 widgets in the first hour, then in the second hour, it will produce 5% less than that. So, the production in the second hour would be 500 minus 5% of 500.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5% of 500 is 0.05 times 500, which is 25. So, in the second hour, the production would be 500 - 25 = 475 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, but this decrease is happening every hour. So, each hour, the production rate is 5% less than the previous hour's rate. This sounds like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by a common ratio.\n\nIn this case, the common ratio would be (1 - 0.05) = 0.95, since the production is decreasing by 5% each hour.\n\nSo, the production in each hour can be represented as:\n\n- Hour 1: 500\n\n- Hour 2: 500 * 0.95\n\n- Hour 3: 500 * 0.95^2\n\n- ...\n\n- Hour 8: 500 * 0.95^7\n\nTo find the total production over 8 hours, I need to sum up these values from hour 1 to hour 8.\n\nThis is a geometric series where the first term a = 500, the common ratio r = 0.95, and the number of terms n = 8.\n\nThe sum S of the first n terms of a geometric series is given by:\n\nS = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 500 * (1 - 0.95^8) / (1 - 0.95)\n\nFirst, calculate 0.95^8.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n0.95^1 = 0.95\n\n0.95^2 = 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025\n\n0.95^3 = 0.9025 * 0.95 = 0.857375\n\n0.95^4 = 0.857375 * 0.95 \u2248 0.81450625\n\n0.95^5 \u2248 0.81450625 * 0.95 \u2248 0.7737809375\n\n0.95^6 \u2248 0.7737809375 * 0.95 \u2248 0.735091890625\n\n0.95^7 \u2248 0.735091890625 * 0.95 \u2248 0.69833729609375\n\n0.95^8 \u2248 0.69833729609375 * 0.95 \u2248 0.6634204312890625\n\nNow, plug this back into the sum formula:\n\nS = 500 * (1 - 0.6634204312890625) / (1 - 0.95)\n\nCalculate 1 - 0.6634204312890625 = 0.3365795687109375\n\n1 - 0.95 = 0.05\n\nSo, S = 500 * (0.3365795687109375) / 0.05\n\nNow, divide 0.3365795687109375 by 0.05:\n\n0.3365795687109375 / 0.05 = 6.73159137421875\n\nThen, multiply by 500:\n\n500 * 6.73159137421875 \u2248 3365.795687109375\n\nSo, the total production over 8 hours is approximately 3365.8 widgets.\n\nBut since we're dealing with whole widgets, we should round this to the nearest whole number.\n\n3365.8 rounds to 3366 widgets.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 0.95^8, I got approximately 0.6634204312890625. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 1 - 0.6634204312890625 = 0.3365795687109375\n\nAnd 1 - 0.95 = 0.05\n\nSo, S = 500 * (0.3365795687109375) / 0.05\n\nDividing 0.3365795687109375 by 0.05 gives 6.73159137421875\n\nThen, 500 * 6.73159137421875 = 3365.795687109375, which rounds to 3366.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nS = 500 * [(1 - 0.95^8) / 0.05]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nS = 500 * [(1 - 0.6634204312890625) / 0.05] = 500 * (0.3365795687109375 / 0.05) = 500 * 6.73159137421875 \u2248 3365.795687109375\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the production for each hour individually and sum them up to verify.\n\nHour 1: 500\n\nHour 2: 500 * 0.95 = 475\n\nHour 3: 475 * 0.95 = 451.25\n\nHour 4: 451.25 * 0.95 \u2248 428.6875\n\nHour 5: 428.6875 * 0.95 \u2248 407.253125\n\nHour 6: 407.253125 * 0.95 \u2248 386.89046875\n\nHour 7: 386.89046875 * 0.95 \u2248 367.5459453125\n\nHour 8: 367.5459453125 * 0.95 \u2248 349.168648046875\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n500 + 475 = 975\n\n975 + 451.25 = 1426.25\n\n1426.25 + 428.6875 \u2248 1854.9375\n\n1854.9375 + 407.253125 \u2248 2262.190625\n\n2262.190625 + 386.89046875 \u2248 2649.08109375\n\n2649.08109375 + 367.5459453125 \u2248 3016.6270390625\n\n3016.6270390625 + 349.168648046875 \u2248 3365.795687109375\n\nYes, that matches the previous total of approximately 3365.795687109375, which rounds to 3366 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the total number of widgets produced during the 8-hour shift is 3366.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3366} \\]"
