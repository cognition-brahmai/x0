        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students, and 60% of them are girls. I need to find out how many boys are in the class. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many girls there are. If 60% of the class are girls, then I can calculate the number of girls by taking 60% of 30.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 30, I can multiply 30 by 0.60.\n\nSo, 30 times 0.60 is 18. That means there are 18 girls in the class.\n\nNow, to find out how many boys there are, I can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.\n\nSo, 30 minus 18 equals 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 boys in the class.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of boys first.\n\nIf 60% are girls, then the remaining percentage must be boys, right?\n\nSo, 100% minus 60% equals 40%. That means 40% of the class are boys.\n\nThen, I can find 40% of 30 to get the number of boys.\n\n40% of 30 is 0.40 times 30, which is 12.\n\nSo, again, I get 12 boys in the class.\n\nAlright, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that my calculation is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if the numbers make sense.\n\nTotal students: 30\n\nGirls: 18\n\nBoys: 12\n\nAdding girls and boys: 18 + 12 = 30, which matches the total number of students.\n\nAlso, 18 girls is 60% of 30, and 12 boys is 40% of 30.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nSo, the answer is 12 boys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
