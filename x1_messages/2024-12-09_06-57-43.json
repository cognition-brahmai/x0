        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 100 people in a group, and among them, 65 have read Book A, 45 have read Book B, and 30 have read both books. I need to find out how many people haven't read either book.\n\nOkay, let me try to understand this. I think this is a classic example of using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. So, the total number of people who have read at least one of the books can be found by adding the number of people who have read Book A and Book B and then subtracting those who have read both, since they are counted twice in the initial addition.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of people who have read at least one book is:\n\nNumber who read A or B = (Number who read A) + (Number who read B) - (Number who read both A and B)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber who read A or B = 65 + 45 - 30 = 80\n\nSo, 80 people have read at least one of the books. Now, to find out how many have not read either book, I subtract this number from the total number of people in the group.\n\nNumber who haven't read either book = Total number of people - Number who read A or B\n\nNumber who haven't read either book = 100 - 80 = 20\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If 65 have read Book A and 45 have read Book B, and 30 have read both, then indeed, the number who have read only Book A is 65 - 30 = 35, and only Book B is 45 - 30 = 15. So, total number who have read at least one book is 35 (only A) + 15 (only B) + 30 (both) = 80, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who haven't read either book is 20.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using sets or Venn diagrams.\n\nIf I imagine two circles overlapping, one for Book A and one for Book B. The overlap represents people who have read both books, which is 30 people. The part of the Book A circle outside the overlap is people who have read only Book A, which is 65 - 30 = 35. Similarly, the part of the Book B circle outside the overlap is people who have read only Book B, which is 45 - 30 = 15.\n\nSo, the total number of people who have read at least one book is 35 + 15 + 30 = 80, as before. And again, subtracting this from the total group size gives 100 - 80 = 20 people who haven't read either book.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use probabilities or some other method, but since this is a straightforward inclusion-exclusion problem, I think the approach I've taken is sufficient and accurate.\n\nI don't see any errors in my reasoning, and the calculations seem correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 20 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
