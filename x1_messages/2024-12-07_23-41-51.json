So, the car is traveling at two different speeds for different amounts of time, and we need to find out the total distance it has traveled.\n\nFirst, it travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance covered in this part of the journey, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nNext, the car increases its speed to 80 miles per hour and travels for another 2 hours. Again, using the same formula:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 80 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 160 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, we just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 240 miles + 160 miles = 400 miles\n\nSo, the car has traveled a total of 400 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
