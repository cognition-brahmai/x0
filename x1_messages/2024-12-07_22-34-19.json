        "content": "Let's see. So, Tom is twice as old as Jerry now, and five years ago, Tom was three times as old as Jerry. I need to find out their current ages.\n\nFirst, I should assign variables to their ages. Let's say Jerry's current age is J years, and Tom's current age is T years.\n\nAccording to the first statement, Tom is twice as old as Jerry, so T = 2J.\n\nThe second statement says that five years ago, Tom was three times as old as Jerry. Five years ago, Tom's age would be T - 5, and Jerry's age would be J - 5. So, T - 5 = 3(J - 5).\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) T = 2J\n\n2) T - 5 = 3(J - 5)\n\nI can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for J.\n\nSo, substituting T from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n2J - 5 = 3(J - 5)\n\nNow, I'll solve for J.\n\n2J - 5 = 3J - 15\n\nSubtract 2J from both sides:\n\n-5 = J - 15\n\nAdd 15 to both sides:\n\n10 = J\n\nSo, Jerry is 10 years old.\n\nNow, using equation 1, T = 2J = 2 * 10 = 20\n\nTherefore, Tom is 20 years old and Jerry is 10 years old.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nFive years ago, Tom was 20 - 5 = 15 years old, and Jerry was 10 - 5 = 5 years old.\n\nWas Tom three times as old as Jerry at that time? 15 is indeed three times 5.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Tom is } 20 \\text{ years old and Jerry is } 10 \\text{ years old.}} \\]"
