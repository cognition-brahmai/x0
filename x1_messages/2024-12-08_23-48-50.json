Pacus are indeed related to piranhas and are native to South America. While piranhas have a reputation for being aggressive and occasionally attacking humans, pacus are generally considered less aggressive and are more herbivorous. There are no credible reports of pacus attacking or feeding on human testicles. It's essential to approach such claims with skepticism and rely on scientific evidence and reputable sources for information. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask."
