        "content": "So, there's a class with 30 students, and 60% of them are female. First, I need to find out how many females there are. \n\nTo do that, I'll calculate 60% of 30. \n\n60% of 30 is (60/100) * 30 = 0.6 * 30 = 18 females.\n\nSo, there are 18 females in the class.\n\nNow, it says that 75% of these females wear glasses. So, I need to find out how many females wear glasses.\n\n75% of 18 is (75/100) * 18 = 0.75 * 18 = 13.5.\n\nBut since we can't have half a person, maybe there's a mistake here. Maybe the numbers aren't supposed to lead to a fraction of a person.\n\nAnyway, proceeding with the calculation, so 13.5 females wear glasses.\n\nNow, I need to find out what percentage of the entire class wears glasses. The entire class has 30 students, and 13.5 of them (assuming these are all the students who wear glasses) wear glasses.\n\nTo find the percentage, I'll use the formula:\n\n( number who wear glasses / total number of students ) * 100\n\nSo, (13.5 / 30) * 100 = ?\n\nFirst, 13.5 divided by 30 is 0.45.\n\nThen, 0.45 multiplied by 100 is 45%.\n\nSo, 45% of the entire class wears glasses.\n\nWait a minute, but this assumes that only females wear glasses. Maybe some males wear glasses too. The problem only says that 75% of females wear glasses, but it doesn't say anything about males wearing glasses.\n\nIf no information is given about males wearing glasses, maybe we're supposed to assume that only females wear glasses.\n\nBut that seems unclear. Maybe I should consider the possibility that males could also wear glasses.\n\nLet me check the problem again.\n\n\"In a class of 30 students, 60% are female. If 75% of the females wear glasses, what percentage of the entire class wears glasses?\"\n\nIt doesn't mention anything about males wearing glasses, so perhaps we should assume that only females wear glasses.\n\nIn that case, the calculation I did earlier is correct: 45% of the class wears glasses.\n\nAlternatively, if males can also wear glasses, but we don't have data on that, maybe the answer is only based on the females who wear glasses.\n\nProbably, since the problem only provides information about females wearing glasses, we should assume that males do not wear glasses for this problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 45%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45\\%} \\]"
