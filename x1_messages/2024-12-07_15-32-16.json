        "content": "Epic films are characterized by dramatic, high-stakes conflicts often revolving around love, honor, rebellion, and sacrifice. These films typically have large-scale productions, spectacular settings, and grandiose themes. They often depict historical events or legendary stories and focus on heroic characters facing monumental challenges. Film noir, on the other hand, is known for its dark, moody atmosphere and themes of crime, jealousy, and moral ambiguity. Comedy films are intended to amuse and entertain through humor and light-hearted situations, while documentaries are non-fictional films that present factual information on various subjects.\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u662fA.
