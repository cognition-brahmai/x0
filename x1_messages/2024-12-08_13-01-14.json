        "content": "Machu Picchu was built by the Inca civilization around 1450. It's located in present-day Peru, high in the Andes Mountains. The estate was abandoned a century later during the Spanish Conquest. The Incas were a remarkable civilization known for their advanced engineering, agriculture, and social structures. Machu Picchu is considered one of the most impressive archaeological sites in the world due to its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments, and panoramic views. The site was hidden for centuries before being rediscovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, an American historian. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World."
