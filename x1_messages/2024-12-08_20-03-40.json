        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a car travels 120 miles on a full tank of gas, and the tank holds 15 gallons. I need to figure out how many miles per gallon the car gets. Okay, miles per gallon\u2014 that's fuel efficiency, right? So, I need to find out how many miles the car can travel per gallon of gas.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. If the car travels 120 miles on a full tank, and the tank is 15 gallons, then to find miles per gallon, I should probably divide the miles by the gallons. So, 120 miles divided by 15 gallons. Let me do that math. 120 divided by 15 is 8. So, 8 miles per gallon.\n\nWait a minute, that seems really low. I mean, I know older cars might get that, but nowadays, most cars get better mileage than that. Maybe I did something wrong. Let me double-check. 120 miles on 15 gallons, so 120 divided by 15 is indeed 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe I should consider how many gallons are used per mile. Wait, no, the question is asking for miles per gallon, which is the standard way to measure fuel efficiency in the US.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If the car travels 120 miles on 15 gallons, then per gallon, it should travel 8 miles. But again, that seems too low. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the tank holds 15 gallons, but the car doesn't use all of it. Sometimes, tanks aren't completely empty when refilled. But the problem says \"a full tank,\" so I think it's safe to assume that it's indeed 15 gallons for 120 miles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a conversion issue. Miles are in imperial units, and gallons can be US gallons or imperial gallons. In the US, we use US gallons, which is what I assume here, unless specified otherwise.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to calculate this. Perhaps using proportions. If 15 gallons allow for 120 miles, then 1 gallon would allow for x miles. So, 15 gallons / 1 gallon = 120 miles / x miles. Solving for x, x = (120 miles * 1 gallon) / 15 gallons = 8 miles per gallon. Again, I get 8 miles per gallon.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider the context. If this is an older car or a truck, 8 miles per gallon could be plausible, but for a regular car, it seems very low. Maybe the problem is trying to illustrate a point about fuel efficiency, or maybe the numbers are hypothetical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe it's supposed to be 30 gallons instead of 15, which would give 4 miles per gallon, or maybe it's supposed to be 120 miles on 10 gallons, which would give 12 miles per gallon. But according to the given numbers, it's 120 miles on 15 gallons, which is 8 miles per gallon.\n\nLet me consider if there's a different formula to use. Sometimes, fuel efficiency is calculated differently, but in the US, miles per gallon is the standard measure. So, I think dividing miles by gallons is the correct approach.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the problem is trying to trick me by giving imperfect numbers, but in this case, the division is straightforward. 120 divided by 15 is indeed 8.\n\nPerhaps I should consider real-world examples. For instance, a car that gets 20-30 miles per gallon is more common nowadays. Some hybrids get even better. So, 8 miles per gallon seems unusually low, but mathematically, based on the given numbers, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about selecting the best solution among multiple options. But in this case, there's only one correct answer, which is 8 miles per gallon.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for multiple solutions and then to rank them based on precision and ease of understanding. But in this straightforward problem, there's only one precise solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are different ways to interpret the problem. For example, perhaps the car doesn't use fuel at a constant rate, but that seems unlikely for this level of problem.\n\nAnother angle: maybe consider the efficiency in different driving conditions. For instance, city vs. highway driving. But again, the problem seems to be straightforward, without additional variables.\n\nPerhaps consider the environmental impact or cost associated with such fuel efficiency, but that's beyond the scope of the question.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, the car gets 8 miles per gallon. While this seems low by modern standards, it's the accurate result based on the provided data.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
