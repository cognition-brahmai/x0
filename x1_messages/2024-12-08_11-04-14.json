        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 6 black socks and 4 white socks in a box. I'm in complete darkness, so I can't see anything, and I need to figure out how many socks I must take out to be sure that I have at least one pair of the same color. Okay, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to be sure. It's not about probability; it's about certainty. So, I need to guarantee that among the socks I pick, there are at least two of the same color.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario. What's the worst that can happen? Well, I could pick one black sock and one white sock. That's two socks, and they're of different colors. So, in that case, I don't have a pair of the same color yet.\n\nNow, if I pick a third sock, it has to be either black or white. If it's black, then I have two black socks, which is a pair. If it's white, then I have two white socks, which is also a pair. So, in either case, by picking three socks, I guarantee that I have at least one pair of the same color.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that I could pick more than two socks without getting a pair? Let's see. If I pick three socks, as I just thought, I'll have either two black and one white, or two white and one black. In both cases, there's a pair.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the maximum number of socks I can pick without getting a pair of the same color. If I pick one black and one white, that's two socks, and no pair yet. But picking a third sock will force a pair, as it must match one of the colors already picked.\n\nSo, it seems that three socks are the minimum I need to pick to guarantee at least one pair of the same color.\n\nLet me double-check this. Suppose I pick four socks. Then, I could have, say, two black and two white, which means I have two pairs. Or, three black and one white, which is a pair of black socks, and so on. But the question is about the minimum number needed to ensure at least one pair.\n\nYes, the worst-case scenario is picking one of each color first, and the next pick guarantees a pair.\n\nSo, the answer should be three socks.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the number of each color. There are 6 black and 4 white. The maximum number of socks without a pair would be picking one black and one white, total two socks. The next pick, whichever color it is, will create a pair.\n\nTherefore, three socks are sufficient to ensure at least one pair of the same color.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
