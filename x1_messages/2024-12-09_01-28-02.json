        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a teacher who wants to form a committee of 3 students out of 10. But there's a catch: two specific students, Alex and Bella, can't be on the committee together because they argue a lot. We need to find out how many different committees can be formed under this condition.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of possible committees without any restrictions. Since the order in which we choose the students doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of unrestricted committees is C(10, 3). Plugging in the values:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10 - 3)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible committees without any restrictions.\n\nNow, we need to account for the condition that Alex and Bella cannot be on the committee together. To do this, it's helpful to calculate the number of committees where both Alex and Bella are included and then subtract that from the total number of unrestricted committees. This way, we'll be left with the number of committees that don't have both Alex and Bella.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many committees include both Alex and Bella.\n\nIf both Alex and Bella are on the committee, then we're choosing 2 specific students (Alex and Bella) and need to choose 1 more student from the remaining 8 students (since there are 10 students in total and 2 are already chosen).\n\nSo, the number of committees with both Alex and Bella is C(8, 1) because we're choosing 1 student from the remaining 8.\n\nC(8, 1) = 8.\n\nSo, there are 8 committees where both Alex and Bella are present.\n\nNow, to find the number of committees where Alex and Bella are not both present, we subtract the number of committees with both from the total number of unrestricted committees.\n\nTherefore, the number of acceptable committees is:\n\nTotal committees - Committees with both Alex and Bella = 120 - 8 = 112.\n\nWait a minute, is that the final answer? Let's double-check to make sure we haven't missed anything.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to consider different scenarios:\n\n1. Committees that include Alex but not Bella.\n\n2. Committees that include Bella but not Alex.\n\n3. Committees that include neither Alex nor Bella.\n\nWe can calculate the number of committees in each of these scenarios and then add them up to get the total number of acceptable committees.\n\nLet's calculate each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: Committees that include Alex but not Bella.\n\nIf Alex is included and Bella is not, we need to choose 2 more students from the remaining 8 students (since Bella is excluded).\n\nNumber of such committees: C(8, 2).\n\nC(8, 2) = (8 \u00d7 7) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 28.\n\nScenario 2: Committees that include Bella but not Alex.\n\nThis is similar to scenario 1. If Bella is included and Alex is not, we choose 2 more students from the remaining 8.\n\nNumber of such committees: C(8, 2) = 28.\n\nScenario 3: Committees that include neither Alex nor Bella.\n\nIf neither Alex nor Bella is included, we choose all 3 students from the remaining 8 students.\n\nNumber of such committees: C(8, 3).\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 56.\n\nNow, adding up all these scenarios:\n\n28 (Alex but not Bella) + 28 (Bella but not Alex) + 56 (neither Alex nor Bella) = 112.\n\nThis matches the earlier result of 112 committees.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of complementary counting, which is what we did first. The total number of committees minus the number of committees that include both Alex and Bella gives us the number of committees that do not include both Alex and Bella, which is what we want.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the number of acceptable committees is 112.\n\nWait, but let's make sure that there are no other restrictions or that we haven't overcounted in any scenario.\n\nIn the first method, we subtracted the committees with both Alex and Bella from the total committees, which should give us the number of committees where either Alex is alone, Bella is alone, or neither is present.\n\nIn the second method, we explicitly counted these scenarios and added them up to get the same total.\n\nTherefore, it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total number of committees and subtract those where both Alex and Bella are present, which is exactly what we did.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 112.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nThe problem states that Alex and Bella cannot be on the committee together. This means that committees with only Alex, only Bella, or neither are allowed, but not both together.\n\nWe've accounted for that in both methods.\n\nAlternatively, some might misinterpret this as neither Alex nor Bella can be on the committee, but that's not the case. The condition is only about them not being together on the committee.\n\nTherefore, our calculation stands correct.\n\nSo, the teacher can form 112 different committees under the given condition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]"
