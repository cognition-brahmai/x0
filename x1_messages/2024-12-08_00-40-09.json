        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and we're told that its length is twice its width. Also, the perimeter of the garden is 48 meters. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width of the garden.\n\nFirst, let's recall what the perimeter of a rectangle is. The perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle. For a rectangle, it's calculated as:\n\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the length is twice the width. So, we can express the length in terms of the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nWe're also given that the perimeter is 48 meters. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 2l + 2w = 48 \\]\n\nBut since \\( l = 2w \\), we can substitute \\( 2w \\) for \\( l \\) in the perimeter equation:\n\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 48 \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 48 \\]\n\n\\[ 6w = 48 \\]\n\nNow, to find \\( w \\), we divide both sides by 6:\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{48}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ w = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the width is 8 meters.\n\nNow, since the length is twice the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the garden are 16 meters in length and 8 meters in width.\n\nWait a minute, let me just double-check that. If the length is 16 meters and the width is 8 meters, the perimeter would be:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 16 + 2 \\times 8 = 32 + 16 = 48 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the given perimeter. So, our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the garden are \\(\\boxed{16 \\text{ meters by } 8 \\text{ meters}}\\)."
