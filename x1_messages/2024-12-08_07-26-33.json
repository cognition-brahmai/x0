        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains moving towards each other from Station A and Station B, which are 300 miles apart.\n\nFirst, train A leaves Station A at 12:00 PM traveling at 60 miles per hour towards Station B. Then, train B leaves Station B at 1:00 PM traveling at 90 miles per hour towards Station A.\n\nSo, train A has a head start of 1 hour because it leaves an hour earlier than train B.\n\nIn that 1 hour, train A covers a distance of 60 miles per hour \u00d7 1 hour = 60 miles.\n\nTherefore, when train B starts at 1:00 PM, the remaining distance between the two trains is 300 miles - 60 miles = 240 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other. So, their speeds add up. Train A is going at 60 mph and train B at 90 mph, so their relative speed is 60 + 90 = 150 miles per hour.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to meet, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 240 miles / 150 miles per hour = 1.6 hours\n\nNow, 1.6 hours is the same as 1 hour and 0.6 \u00d7 60 minutes = 36 minutes.\n\nSo, the trains will meet 1 hour and 36 minutes after train B starts at 1:00 PM.\n\nTherefore, the meeting time is 1:00 PM + 1 hour 36 minutes = 2:36 PM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total time train A has been traveling when they meet.\n\nTrain A starts at 12:00 PM and meets train B at 2:36 PM, which is 2 hours and 36 minutes, or 2.6 hours.\n\nDistance covered by train A = 60 mph \u00d7 2.6 hours = 156 miles.\n\nTrain B starts at 1:00 PM and travels until 2:36 PM, which is 1 hour and 36 minutes, or 1.6 hours.\n\nDistance covered by train B = 90 mph \u00d7 1.6 hours = 144 miles.\n\nTotal distance covered by both trains: 156 + 144 = 300 miles, which matches the distance between the stations.\n\nSo, yes, the trains meet at 2:36 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2:36 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
