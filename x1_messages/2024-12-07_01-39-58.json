        "content": "Let's see. I have this question about sports science. It says that sports science studies how the healthy human body works during exercise, and how sport and physical activity promote health and performance. It looks at things from the cellular level all the way up to the whole body. It mentions the body's metabolic response to exercise, the role of physical activity in preventing disease, and how the body adapts to the stresses of exercise.\n\nThe question is asking what sports science does NOT study, and there are four options:\n\nA. The body's metabolic response to exercise\n\nB. The role of physical activity in the prevention of disease\n\nC. The impact of diet on athletic performance\n\nD. How the body's structures and functions are adapted to the stresses of exercise\n\nOkay, so from the description, sports science does study the body's metabolic response to exercise, which is option A. It also studies the role of physical activity in preventing disease, that's option B. And it examines how the body's structures and functions adapt to the stresses of exercise, which is option D.\n\nSo, the one that's not mentioned is option C: the impact of diet on athletic performance. Now, wait a minute, I'm a bit unsure here. Doesn't sports science also look at nutrition and diet? I mean, athletes often focus on their diet to improve performance. Maybe it's studying how diet affects the body's metabolic responses or something like that.\n\nBut based on the information given in the question, it only mentions metabolic responses, the prevention of disease through physical activity, and adaptation to exercise stresses. It doesn't explicitly mention diet.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is C, the impact of diet on athletic performance, because it's not mentioned in the description provided.\n\nBut I feel like sports science does cover nutrition and diet, especially in the context of athletic performance. Maybe it's just not included in this particular description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe diet is considered part of the metabolic response to exercise, in which case it would be included in option A.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think differently. If I consider that metabolic responses are how the body processes nutrients and energy during exercise, then diet could be a factor that influences those metabolic responses.\n\nBut the question is about what sports science does NOT study, and according to the description given, it's about metabolic responses, prevention of disease through physical activity, and adaptation to exercise stresses.\n\nDiet impact on athletic performance isn't directly mentioned in those points.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is C, the impact of diet on athletic performance, because it's not explicitly covered in the description provided.\n\nBut again, I have a nagging feeling that sports science does encompass nutrition and diet, especially for athletes.\n\nMaybe I should consider that sports science might involve interdisciplinary studies, including nutrition, physiology, biology, etc.\n\nBut based strictly on the information given in the question, it seems that option C is the one not mentioned.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. The impact of diet on athletic performance.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. The body's metabolic response to exercise - mentioned directly.\n\nB. The role of physical activity in the prevention of disease - mentioned directly.\n\nC. The impact of diet on athletic performance - not directly mentioned.\n\nD. How the body's structures and functions are adapted to the stresses of exercise - mentioned directly.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
