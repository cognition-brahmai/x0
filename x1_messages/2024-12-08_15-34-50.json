        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem about a farmer who has ducks and cows, and he counts 30 heads and 80 legs in total. I need to figure out how many ducks there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of ducks as D and the number of cows as C.\n\nSince each animal has one head, the total number of heads should be equal to the total number of animals. So, D + C = 30.\n\nNow, for the legs. Ducks have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs would be 2D + 4C = 80.\n\nAlright, so I have two equations:\n\n1. D + C = 30\n\n2. 2D + 4C = 80\n\nI need to solve these equations to find the value of D, which is the number of ducks.\n\nHmm, maybe I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation. Let's solve the first equation for D:\n\nD = 30 - C\n\nNow, plug this into the second equation:\n\n2(30 - C) + 4C = 80\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n60 - 2C + 4C = 80\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n60 + 2C = 80\n\nNow, subtract 60 from both sides:\n\n2C = 20\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nC = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 cows. Now, plug this back into the first equation to find D:\n\nD + 10 = 30\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\nD = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 20 ducks.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 20 ducks and 10 cows, that totals 30 heads, which matches the first piece of information. Now, for the legs: 20 ducks times 2 legs each is 40 legs, and 10 cows times 4 legs each is 40 legs, totaling 80 legs, which matches the second piece of information.\n\nLooks good. I think 20 is the correct number of ducks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
