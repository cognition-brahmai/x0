        "content": "Yes, during the 1969 Miss America pageant, there was a protest by feminist activists outside the event. One of the most iconic acts of this protest was the \"Freedom Trash Can,\" into which women symbolically threw items that represented oppressive gender norms, including bras, girdles, high-heeled shoes, and other feminine products. This act was meant to challenge the objectification and sexualization of women in the beauty pageant industry and society at large. The media often sensationalized this event, focusing on the bra-burning aspect, which has since become a symbol of the feminist movement's fight against gender inequality."
