Determine the total monthly electricity consumption for all households.\n2. Multiply the total consumption by the cost per kWh to find the revenue.\n\nFirst, let's find the total monthly electricity consumption. There are 20,000 households, and each household consumes an average of 350 kWh per month. So, the total consumption is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total consumption} = \\text{number of households} \\times \\text{average consumption per household} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total consumption} = 20,000 \\times 350 \\, \\text{kWh} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n\\[ 20,000 \\times 350 = 7,000,000 \\, \\text{kWh} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much revenue is generated from this consumption. The cost of electricity is $0.12 per kWh. Therefore, the total revenue is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = \\text{total consumption} \\times \\text{cost per kWh} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 7,000,000 \\, \\text{kWh} \\times 0.12 \\, \\text{\\$/kWh} \\]\n\nLet's do the multiplication:\n\n\\[ 7,000,000 \\times 0.12 = 840,000 \\, \\text{\\$} \\]\n\nSo, the total revenue generated by the electricity provider in this city every month is $840,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{840000} \\]"
