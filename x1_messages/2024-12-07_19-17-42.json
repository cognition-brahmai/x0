It's often referred to as the \"Atlantic Years\" compilation, but the specific album with \"Respect\" and \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" is actually \"I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You,\" released in 1967. However, her greatest hits and many of her iconic songs are indeed associated with her time at Atlantic Records. Aretha Franklin is renowned for her soulful voice and powerful performances, and these songs are staples of the soul music genre."
