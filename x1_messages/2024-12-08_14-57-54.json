        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 20 balls: 10 are red, 5 are blue, and 5 are green. I need to find the probability of picking either a red ball or a blue ball. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the basic formula for probability. The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is picking a red or a blue ball.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls in the box, which is 20.\n\nNext, I need to determine the number of favorable outcomes. Here, favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball. There are 10 red balls and 5 blue balls. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 10 (red) plus 5 (blue), which equals 15.\n\nNow, I can plug these numbers into the probability formula:\n\nProbability = number of favorable outcomes / total number of possible outcomes = 15 / 20\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5:\n\n15 \u00f7 5 = 3\n\n20 \u00f7 5 = 4\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this probability as a decimal or a percentage. To convert the fraction 3/4 to a decimal, I divide 3 by 4, which equals 0.75. To express it as a percentage, I multiply the decimal by 100, so 0.75 \u00d7 100 = 75%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red ball or a blue ball is 3/4, or 0.75, or 75%.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check. The box has 20 balls in total: 10 red, 5 blue, and 5 green. Picking a red or blue ball means I'm interested in any of the 15 balls that are either red or blue. So, 15 out of 20 is indeed 3/4.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability of not picking a green ball, since the only other option besides red and blue is green. There are 5 green balls out of 20, so the probability of picking a green ball is 5/20, which simplifies to 1/4. Therefore, the probability of not picking a green ball (i.e., picking either red or blue) is 1 minus the probability of picking green:\n\nProbability (red or blue) = 1 - Probability (green) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 3/4 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}} \\]"
