I need to find out the total production for the month.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the daily production. If the factory produces 150 units each hour and operates for 16 hours a day, then the daily production would be:\n\nDaily production = units per hour \u00d7 hours per day\n\nSo, that's 150 units/hour \u00d7 16 hours/day.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n150 \u00d7 16 = 2,400 units per day.\n\nAlright, now I need to find out the monthly production. There are 30 days in the month, so:\n\nMonthly production = daily production \u00d7 days per month\n\nThat would be 2,400 units/day \u00d7 30 days.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n2,400 \u00d7 30 = 72,000 units.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 150 units per hour for 16 hours:\n\n150 \u00d7 16 = 2,400 units per day. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 2,400 units per day for 30 days:\n\n2,400 \u00d7 30 = 72,000 units.\n\nYeah, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the production, like downtime, maintenance, or holidays. But according to the problem, it just says the factory operates 16 hours a day for 30 days, so I think assuming constant production is fine for this calculation.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 72,000 units in a month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72000} \\]"
