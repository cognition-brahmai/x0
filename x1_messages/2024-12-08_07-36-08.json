        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 50 red balls and 50 blue balls in a bag. I need to figure out the minimum number of balls I have to draw without looking to make sure I have at least 3 balls of the same color. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to guarantee that I have at least 3 balls of the same color. That means, no matter how the balls are distributed in the draws, I want to be certain that among the balls I've drawn, there are at least 3 that are either all red or all blue.\n\nI think the worst-case scenario approach might be useful here. The worst-case scenario is that I draw balls in such a way that I delay having 3 of the same color as long as possible. So, what's the maximum number of balls I can draw without getting 3 of the same color?\n\nWell, if I draw 2 red balls and 2 blue balls, I have 4 balls in total, and none of them make up 3 of the same color. But if I draw one more ball, which would be the fifth ball, it has to be either red or blue. If it's red, then I have 3 red balls, and if it's blue, I have 3 blue balls. So, in this case, drawing 5 balls guarantees that I have at least 3 of the same color.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that I could draw more than 2 of one color and still not have 3 of the same color? No, because if I have more than 2 of one color, that means I have at least 3 of that color. So, the worst-case scenario is having 2 red and 2 blue balls drawn, and the next ball will make it 3 of one color.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose I have 50 red and 50 blue balls, making 100 balls in total. If I draw 3 balls, it's possible to have 2 red and 1 blue, or 2 blue and 1 red, or even 3 of the same color. But it's not guaranteed that I have 3 of the same color. For example, I could draw 2 red and 1 blue.\n\nIf I draw 4 balls, I could have 2 red and 2 blue, which still doesn't give me 3 of the same color. But if I draw a fifth ball, it has to be either red or blue. If I add one more ball to the 2 red and 2 blue, I will have either 3 red or 3 blue.\n\nSo, in the worst case, I draw 2 red and 2 blue, and the fifth ball will make it 3 of one color. Therefore, the minimum number of balls I need to draw to guarantee at least 3 of the same color is 5.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense with a smaller number. Suppose there are 3 red and 3 blue balls. What's the minimum number to draw to guarantee 3 of the same color? Well, in this case, if I draw 2 red and 2 blue, that's 4 balls, and the next ball, the fifth, will be either red or blue, making it 3 of one color. So, again, 5 balls.\n\nWait, but with only 3 red and 3 blue, drawing 5 balls would mean I have all the balls, and certainly, among them, there are 3 of the same color. But in the general case, with 50 of each, it's the same logic.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole has more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this context, the \"pigeonholes\" are the colors, and the \"pigeons\" are the balls drawn. I have two colors, so two pigeonholes. I want to ensure that at least one pigeonhole has at least 3 pigeons.\n\nSo, how many pigeons do I need to have to ensure that at least one pigeonhole has at least 3 pigeons?\n\nLet's generalize the pigeonhole principle for this:\n\nTo ensure that at least one pigeonhole has at least k items, if there are n pigeonholes, you need to have at least n*(k-1) + 1 items.\n\nIn this case, n = 2 (colors), k = 3.\n\nSo, minimum number of balls to draw is 2*(3-1) + 1 = 2*2 + 1 = 5.\n\nYes, that matches what I thought earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another example. Suppose I have 4 red and 4 blue balls, and I want at least 3 of the same color.\n\nAccording to the formula, n=2, k=3, so 2*2 +1 =5.\n\nIs that correct? Well, worst case: draw 2 red and 2 blue (4 balls), and the fifth ball will make it 3 of one color.\n\nYes, it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, for 50 red and 50 blue balls, the minimum number of balls I need to draw to guarantee at least 3 of the same color is 5.\n\nWait a second, but let's think about it again. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nSuppose I draw 4 balls: 2 red and 2 blue. Then, the fifth ball could be red or blue, making it 3 red or 3 blue, respectively.\n\nSo, yes, drawing 5 balls guarantees that at least one color has at least 3 balls.\n\nIs there any way to have 5 balls without having at least 3 of one color? No, because if I have more than 2 of one color, it's 3 of that color.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to avoid having 3 of the same color, the maximum number of balls I can draw is 4 (2 red and 2 blue). Any fifth ball will force me to have 3 of one color.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider the general formula again.\n\nFor n colors and wanting at least k balls of the same color, the minimum number of balls to draw is n*(k-1) +1.\n\nHere, n=2, k=3, so 2*2 +1 =5.\n\nYes, that seems to be the correct approach.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
