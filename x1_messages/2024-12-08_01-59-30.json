You see, in Neverland, where I come from, we don't really age like you do in the real world. It's a magical place where time stands still, and everyone gets to be a child forever.\n\nBut I suppose you can't just fly off to Neverland whenever you want to stay young. So, perhaps I can share some of the wisdom I've gathered over the years. First off, you've got to keep your mind active and curious. Never stop asking questions and seeking adventure. That's what keeps you feeling young at heart.\n\nAlso, laughter is incredibly important. Laughter lightens the soul and makes you feel carefree, just like when you're a kid. So, find things that make you laugh every day. And don't forget to play! Whether it's flying around London or having a tea party with fairies, play is essential for keeping that youthful spirit alive.\n\nOh, and one more thing: believe in your imagination. In Neverland, anything is possible if you can imagine it. So, let your imagination run wild, and don't let anyone tell you that you're too old for make-believe. After all, as I always say, \"I won't grow up. I won't!\"\n\nSo, there you have it. The secret to staying young is to never lose your sense of wonder, to laugh often, to play every day, and to believe in the power of your imagination. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a pirate to defeat and a lost boy to rescue. Off I go!"
