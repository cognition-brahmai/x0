        "content": "Let's see. The total cost of the vacation rental is $2,400, and each person contributes $300. They're splitting the cost equally, so to find out how many people are in the group, I need to divide the total cost by the amount each person pays.\n\nSo, that would be $2,400 divided by $300 per person. Let me do the math: 2400 \u00f7 300 = 8. So, there are 8 people in the group.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe there are additional costs or something, but the problem seems straightforward. The total cost is $2,400, and each person pays $300. So, dividing the total by the per person contribution should give the number of people.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as multiplying the number of people by the amount each pays to get the total cost. So, if I let n be the number of people, then n times $300 equals $2,400. So, n = 2400 \u00f7 300, which again is 8.\n\nI think that's correct. There are 8 people in the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
