        "content": "So the company's revenue increases by 10% each year, and it started with $200,000 in its first year. I need to find out what the revenue will be in the fourth year. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 10% increase means. If something increases by 10%, it means it becomes 110% of its original amount. For example, if I have $100 and it increases by 10%, it becomes $110. So, in this case, each year the revenue is 110% of the previous year's revenue.\n\nNow, the company starts with $200,000 in the first year. To find the second year's revenue, I need to increase $200,000 by 10%. That would be $200,000 multiplied by 1.10, which is $220,000.\n\nFor the third year, I take the second year's revenue, which is $220,000, and increase it by another 10%. So, $220,000 times 1.10 equals $242,000.\n\nFinally, for the fourth year, I take the third year's revenue, $242,000, and increase it by another 10%. So, $242,000 times 1.10 equals $266,200.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without doing it year by year? I think there is a formula for compound growth like this. It's similar to how interest accrues on money in a bank account.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, the revenue increases by 10% each year, and it's compounded annually, so n=1. The time t is 3 years because we're going from year 1 to year 4, which is a 3-year period.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nA = 200,000 * (1 + 0.10/1)^(1*3) = 200,000 * (1.10)^3.\n\nCalculating that, 1.10 to the power of 3 is 1.331. So, A = 200,000 * 1.331 = $266,200.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by calculating year by year. So, the revenue in the fourth year will be $266,200.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check again.\n\nFirst year: $200,000.\n\nSecond year: $200,000 * 1.10 = $220,000.\n\nThird year: $220,000 * 1.10 = $242,000.\n\nFourth year: $242,000 * 1.10 = $266,200.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the revenue each year is multiplied by 1.10. So, after three years of growth, it would be the original amount multiplied by 1.10 three times, which is the same as multiplying by 1.10^3.\n\nSo, $200,000 * 1.10^3 = $200,000 * 1.331 = $266,200.\n\nEither way, I end up with the same answer. So, I'm confident that $266,200 is the correct revenue for the fourth year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{266200} \\]"
