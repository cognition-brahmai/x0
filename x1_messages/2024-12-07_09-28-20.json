It's generally recommended not to use cotton swabs to clean the ear canal because they can push wax deeper into the ear and potentially damage the eardrum. The ear is self-cleaning, and wax usually moves out on its own. If you have issues with earwax buildup, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for safe cleaning methods."
