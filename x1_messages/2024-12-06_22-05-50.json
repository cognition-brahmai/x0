        "content": "Let's see here. The farmer has 15 sheep, and the statement says \"all but 8 die.\" So, I need to figure out how many sheep are left alive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"all but 8 die\" means. Does it mean that all the sheep die except for 8 of them? Or is there something else going on here?\n\nLet me think about the phrase \"all but 8.\" If \"all but 8 die,\" it seems like all the sheep die except for 8. So, if the farmer had 15 sheep and all but 8 die, that means 15 minus 8 sheep die, right?\n\nSo, 15 minus 8 is 7. Wait, but if all but 8 die, that would mean 7 die and 8 are left alive. But that doesn't make sense because if 7 die, then 8 are left, but the phrase says \"all but 8 die,\" which seems like all except 8 die.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try another approach.\n\nSuppose the farmer has 15 sheep. If \"all but 8 die,\" it means that only 8 sheep do not die. So, those 8 sheep are the ones that are left alive.\n\nTherefore, the number of sheep left alive is 8.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's a trick in the question.\n\nLet me consider the phrase again: \"all but 8 die.\" Does it mean that all of the sheep die except for 8? If so, then yes, 8 are left alive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"all but 8\" means something different in this context. Perhaps it's referring to something else besides the sheep dying.\n\nBut the question clearly says \"all but 8 die,\" so it seems straightforward. All the sheep die except for 8, meaning that 8 sheep survive.\n\nSo, the answer should be that there are 8 sheep left.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose the farmer has 15 sheep, and all but 8 die. Could \"all but 8\" be referring to something else, like the number of sheep that are sold or moved elsewhere?\n\nNo, the question specifically says \"die.\" So, it's about the sheep that die.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"all but 8 die\" is a tricky way of saying that 8 sheep die, but that doesn't make sense because if 8 die, then 7 would be left, but the phrase says \"all but 8 die,\" which suggests that all except 8 die.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. If \"all but 8 die,\" it means that all sheep except for 8 die. So, the 8 that don't die are the ones that are left alive.\n\nTherefore, the number of sheep left alive is 8.\n\nI think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that \"all but 8\" means \"all except 8.\" So, if all except 8 die, then those 8 exceptions are the ones that don't die, meaning they are left alive.\n\nSo, the answer is 8 sheep are left.\n\nI don't think there's any other reasonable interpretation of the phrase \"all but 8 die.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 8 sheep are left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
