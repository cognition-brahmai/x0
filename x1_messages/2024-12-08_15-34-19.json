        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are five houses in a row, each a different color: blue, red, green, yellow, and white. I need to figure out the order based on the given clues.\n\nFirst clue: The blue house is next to the red house.\n\nSo, blue and red are adjacent to each other. They could be in either order: blue-red or red-blue.\n\nSecond clue: The green house is two houses away from the yellow house.\n\nThis means there are exactly two houses between green and yellow.\n\nThird clue: The white house is between the blue and green houses.\n\nSo, white is immediately next to both blue and green.\n\nAlright, let's try to put this together.\n\nLet me denote the five positions as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nFrom the first clue, blue and red are next to each other. So possible pairs could be:\n\n- Positions 1 and 2\n\n- Positions 2 and 3\n\n- Positions 3 and 4\n\n- Positions 4 and 5\n\nNow, the third clue says white is between blue and green. That means white is adjacent to both blue and green.\n\nSo, if white is in position x, then blue is in x-1 and green in x+1, or blue in x+1 and green in x-1.\n\nBut we also know that blue is next to red. So, blue can't be at an end unless red is on the other side.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Maybe I should list out possible arrangements.\n\nLet me consider the possible positions for blue and red first.\n\nOption 1: Blue in 1, red in 2.\n\nThen, white must be next to blue, so white could be in position 3 (since position 2 is red).\n\nBut if white is in 3, then green would be in 4 (since white is between blue and green).\n\nSo, positions:\n\n1. Blue\n\n2. Red\n\n3. White\n\n4. Green\n\n5. Yellow\n\nNow, check the second clue: green is two houses away from yellow.\n\nIn this arrangement, green is in 4, yellow is in 5. They are only one house apart, not two. So this doesn't work.\n\nOption 2: Red in 1, blue in 2.\n\nThen, white must be next to blue, so white could be in 3.\n\nThen, green would be in 4.\n\nSo, positions:\n\n1. Red\n\n2. Blue\n\n3. White\n\n4. Green\n\n5. Yellow\n\nCheck the second clue: green in 4, yellow in 5. Again, only one house apart. Doesn't satisfy the clue.\n\nOption 3: Blue in 2, red in 3.\n\nThen, white must be next to blue, so white could be in 1 or 4.\n\nIf white is in 1, then green would be in 3, but red is already in 3. That's a conflict.\n\nIf white is in 4, then green would be in 5.\n\nSo, positions:\n\n2. Blue\n\n3. Red\n\n4. White\n\n5. Green\n\n1. Yellow\n\nCheck the second clue: green in 5, yellow in 1. They are two houses apart (1 and 5: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \u2014 there are two houses in between 1 and 5). So, green in 5 and yellow in 1 are two houses apart. This works.\n\nSo, this arrangement seems possible:\n\n1. Yellow\n\n2. Blue\n\n3. Red\n\n4. White\n\n5. Green\n\nLet me check if all clues are satisfied.\n\nFirst clue: blue is next to red. Yes, positions 2 and 3.\n\nSecond clue: green is two houses away from yellow. Green in 5, yellow in 1. Yes, two houses in between.\n\nThird clue: white is between blue and green. White in 4 is between blue in 2 and green in 5. Hmm, but technically, white is not immediately between blue and green. Blue is in 2, white is in 4, green is in 5. So, white is next to green, but not next to blue. Maybe this is not correct.\n\nWait, the third clue says \"the white house is between the blue and green houses.\" So, white should be in a position that is between blue and green.\n\nIn the arrangement above, blue is in 2, white is in 4, green is in 5. White is between blue and green in the sense that blue comes before white, and green comes after white.\n\nBut perhaps \"between\" means immediately next, with blue on one side and green on the other.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAlternative interpretation: white is adjacent to both blue and green.\n\nIn that case, white must be next to both blue and green.\n\nIn the previous arrangement, white is next only to green, not to blue.\n\nSo, perhaps my interpretation was incorrect.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIf white is between blue and green, it must be adjacent to both.\n\nSo, white must have blue on one side and green on the other.\n\nTherefore, the sequence must be blue-white-green or green-white-blue.\n\nGiven that blue is next to red, and white is between blue and green, let's see.\n\nOption 1: blue-white-green.\n\nThen, blue is next to white and red (from the first clue).\n\nSo, if blue is between white and red.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the relative positions.\n\nFrom the first clue: blue is next to red.\n\nFrom the third clue: white is between blue and green.\n\nSo, white is immediately between blue and green.\n\nTherefore, the sequence must be blue-white-green or green-white-blue.\n\nNow, considering the first clue, blue is next to red, so red must be next to blue.\n\nIf the sequence is blue-white-green, then red must be next to blue, so red could be on the left of blue.\n\nSo, red-blue-white-green.\n\nBut we have five houses, so need to place yellow and ensure that green is two houses away from yellow.\n\nSo, if we have:\n\n1. Red\n\n2. Blue\n\n3. White\n\n4. Green\n\n5. Yellow\n\nNow, green is in 4, yellow in 5. They are only one house apart, which doesn't satisfy the second clue that they should be two houses apart.\n\nAlternative arrangement:\n\nIf we have green-white-blue, then considering blue is next to red, red could be on the right of blue.\n\nSo, green-white-blue-red.\n\nThen, position 5 would be yellow.\n\nSo, positions:\n\n1. Green\n\n2. White\n\n3. Blue\n\n4. Red\n\n5. Yellow\n\nNow, check the second clue: green is in 1, yellow in 5. They are two houses apart (1,2,3,4,5 \u2014 two houses in between). This works.\n\nSo, this arrangement satisfies all clues:\n\n1. Green\n\n2. White\n\n3. Blue\n\n4. Red\n\n5. Yellow\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- Blue is next to red: positions 3 and 4.\n\n- Green is two houses away from yellow: positions 1 and 5, with two houses in between.\n\n- White is between blue and green: position 2 is white, between blue in 3 and green in 1.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, white is between green and blue, which satisfies the between condition.\n\nTherefore, the order of the houses is:\n\n1. Green\n\n2. White\n\n3. Blue\n\n4. Red\n\n5. Yellow\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Green, White, Blue, Red, Yellow}} \\]"
