        "content": "So, you've got this scenario where buses leave the station every 15 minutes, and you arrive at the station at a random time. You want to know what the average waiting time would be until the next bus arrives. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst off, I think this has something to do with probability, right? Because you're arriving at a random time, so the waiting time could be anything from 0 minutes (if you happen to arrive just as the bus is leaving) up to 14 minutes (if you arrive right after a bus has left).\n\nI recall that in probability, when dealing with uniform distributions, the average or expected value is usually the midpoint of the range. So, if the waiting time can be anywhere from 0 to 15 minutes, maybe the average waiting time is just half of that, which would be 7.5 minutes.\n\nWait a second, but the buses leave every 15 minutes, so the interval is 15 minutes. If I think of this as a cycle where each cycle is 15 minutes, and within that cycle, the bus arrives at the end of the cycle, then if I arrive at a random time within that cycle, the waiting time would be the remaining time till the end of the cycle.\n\nSo, mathematically, if we let the cycle be from time t=0 to t=15 minutes, and you arrive at some random time t within that interval, then the waiting time w would be 15 - t.\n\nTo find the average waiting time, we need to find the expected value of w, which is the integral of w with respect to t, divided by the interval length.\n\nSo, E[w] = (1/15) * \u222b(15 - t) dt from 0 to 15.\n\nLet me compute that integral.\n\n\u222b(15 - t) dt from 0 to 15 = [15t - (1/2)t\u00b2] from 0 to 15 = (15*15 - (1/2)*15\u00b2) - (0) = 225 - (1/2)*225 = 225 - 112.5 = 112.5.\n\nThen, E[w] = (1/15) * 112.5 = 7.5 minutes.\n\nOkay, that matches my initial thought. So, the average waiting time is 7.5 minutes.\n\nBut, just to make sure, maybe there's another way to look at this. Perhaps using the concept of uniform distribution.\n\nIf the arrival time is uniformly distributed over the 15-minute interval, then the expected waiting time should indeed be half of the interval, which is 7.5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the average of all possible waiting times. If you arrive at time t=0, waiting time is 0; at t=1, waiting time is 14; at t=2, waiting time is 13; and so on, up to t=14, waiting time is 1; at t=15, waiting time is 0 again.\n\nSo, the waiting times would be symmetric around t=7.5 minutes, with waiting times increasing from 0 to 7.5 minutes and then decreasing back to 0.\n\nAgain, the average of these waiting times would be 7.5 minutes.\n\nWait, but actually, if you plot waiting time w against arrival time t, w = 15 - t for t from 0 to 15, it's a straight line starting at 15 and going down to 0.\n\nThe area under this line is a triangle with base 15 and height 15, so area is (1/2)*15*15 = 112.5, and dividing by the interval length of 15 gives E[w] = 7.5 minutes.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using the concept of geometric distribution or something else in probability?\n\nWell, geometric distribution is usually for discrete events, like the number of trials until the first success, but here we have a continuous time interval, so maybe not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the bus arrivals as a Poisson process, but I don't think that's necessary here since the buses are leaving at fixed intervals, not randomly.\n\nSo, sticking with the uniform distribution approach seems appropriate.\n\nLet me consider if there are any assumptions I'm making that might be wrong.\n\nAssumption 1: The arrival time is uniformly distributed over the 15-minute interval. Is this reasonable? Well, since you arrive at a random time, and no other information is given, assuming uniform distribution seems fair.\n\nAssumption 2: The buses leave exactly every 15 minutes with no variation. Again, based on the problem statement, this seems acceptable.\n\nAssumption 3: The cycle repeats indefinitely. That is, after every 15 minutes, a bus leaves.\n\nNow, to generalize this, if the bus interval is 'k' minutes instead of 15, what would be the average waiting time?\n\nUsing the same logic, E[w] = (1/k) * \u222b(k - t) dt from 0 to k = (1/k) * [k*t - (1/2)t\u00b2] from 0 to k = (1/k) * (k\u00b2 - (1/2)k\u00b2) = (1/k) * (1/2)k\u00b2 = (1/2)k.\n\nSo, for any bus interval of 'k' minutes, the average waiting time is k/2 minutes.\n\nIn this specific case, k=15, so E[w]=7.5 minutes.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's think about what the distribution of waiting times looks like.\n\nIf you plot waiting time w against arrival time t, w = k - t for t from 0 to k.\n\nThis is a straight line starting at w=k when t=0 and decreasing linearly to w=0 when t=k.\n\nThe probability density function (pdf) of t is uniform, f(t) = 1/k for t between 0 and k.\n\nTherefore, the expected value E[w] = \u222bw*f(t) dt from 0 to k = \u222b(k - t)*(1/k) dt from 0 to k.\n\nWhich simplifies to (1/k) * \u222b(k - t) dt from 0 to k, which we've already computed as k/2.\n\nAlternatively, since w = k - t, and E[t] = integral of t*f(t) dt from 0 to k = (1/k) * \u222bt dt from 0 to k = (1/k) * [(1/2)k\u00b2] = k/2.\n\nTherefore, E[w] = E[k - t] = k - E[t] = k - k/2 = k/2.\n\nAgain, confirming that the average waiting time is k/2 minutes.\n\nSo, for k=15, E[w]=7.5 minutes.\n\nNow, is there any other factor that could affect this? For example, if the buses are not leaving exactly every 15 minutes, but there's some variability in the intervals, would that change the average waiting time?\n\nBut in this problem, buses are leaving every 15 minutes consistently, so no need to consider variability.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if you consider the time between buses varies, then the waiting time distribution would change, and perhaps the average waiting time would be different.\n\nBut in this case, it's fixed at 15 minutes, so we can stick with the uniform distribution approach.\n\nAlso, I should note that this is the average waiting time. The actual waiting time for any particular arrival would be somewhere between 0 and 15 minutes, but on average, it's 7.5 minutes.\n\nSome people might intuitively think that since buses come every 15 minutes, the average waiting time should be 15 minutes, but that would be incorrect because you're more likely to arrive during the earlier part of the interval when the waiting time is longer, but due to the uniform distribution, it averages out to half the interval.\n\nWait, actually, no. In a uniform distribution, every point in the interval is equally likely, so the average waiting time is indeed half the interval.\n\nAlternatively, some people might think that because the buses come every 15 minutes, the average waiting time is 15 minutes, but that would be the total interval, not the average wait.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the average waiting time until the next bus arrives is 7.5 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
