        "content": "The Galapagos Islands are part of Ecuador, a country in northwestern South America. The archipelago is located in the Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the western coast of the mainland. The islands are renowned for their diverse and endemic species, which were influential in Charles Darwin's development of the theory of evolution by natural selection after his visit in 1835. Today, the Galapagos Islands are a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, known for their extraordinary biodiversity and conservation efforts."
