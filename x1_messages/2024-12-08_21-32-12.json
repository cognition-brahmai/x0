        "content": "Sure! Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. Below is a Python script that implements Dijkstra's algorithm for an undirected, weighted graph.\n\nFirst, make sure to install the necessary library:\n\n```bash\npip install networkx\n```\n\nHere's the Python script:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start, end):\n    # Initialize distances and previous nodes\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    previous_nodes = {node: None for node in graph}\n    \n    # Priority queue to hold nodes to visit\n    priority_queue = [(0, start)]\n    \n    while priority_queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        \n        # Nodes can get added to the priority queue multiple times. We only\n        # process a node the first time we remove it from the priority queue.\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():\n            distance = current_distance + weight\n            # Only consider this new path if it's better\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node\n                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    path = []\n    current = end\n    while current is not None:\n        path.append(current)\n        current = previous_nodes[current]\n    # Reverse path to get from start to end\n    path = path[::-1]\n    \n    return path, distances[end]\n\ndef main():\n    # Example graph represented as an adjacency dictionary\n    graph = {\n        'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},\n        'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},\n        'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},\n        'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}\n    }\n    \n    start_node = 'A'\n    end_node = 'D'\n    \n    path, distance = dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node)\n    \n    print(f\"Shortest path from {start_node} to {end_node}: {path}\")\n    print(f\"Distance: {distance}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Graph Representation**:\n   - The graph is represented as an adjacency dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is another dictionary containing neighboring nodes and their edge weights.\n\n2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n   - **Initialization**: Set the distance to the start node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\n   - **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the closest node.\n   - **Relaxation**: For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the distance through the current node and update the distance if it's shorter.\n   - **Path Reconstruction**: Once the end node is reached, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the end node to the start node using the `previous_nodes` dictionary.\n\n3. **Example Usage**:\n   - A sample graph is defined with nodes 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'.\n   - The script finds the shortest path from 'A' to 'D' and prints the path and its total distance.\n\nThis script should work for any undirected, weighted graph represented in the specified format. If you have a different graph or need to handle larger graphs, you can adjust the `graph` dictionary accordingly."
