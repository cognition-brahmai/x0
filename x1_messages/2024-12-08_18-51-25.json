        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car rental company has 200 cars, and they rent out 80% of them. First, I need to figure out how many cars they are renting out.\n\nTo find 80% of 200, I can calculate:\n\n0.80 \u00d7 200 = 160 cars\n\nSo, they rent out 160 cars. That means the number of cars available for rent at any time is:\n\nTotal cars - rented cars = 200 - 160 = 40 cars\n\nBut they want to have 50 cars available for rent at all times. So, they need to have more cars in total to achieve that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of cars they need as x. Then, 80% of x are rented out, and 20% are available for rent.\n\nSo, 20% of x should be equal to 50 cars.\n\nMathematically, that\u2019s:\n\n0.20x = 50\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 50 / 0.20 = 250 cars\n\nSo, they need to have 250 cars in total to have 50 available for rent.\n\nNow, they currently have 200 cars. So, the number of cars they need to purchase is:\n\n250 - 200 = 50 cars\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nIf they have 250 cars and rent out 80% of them:\n\n0.80 \u00d7 250 = 200 cars rented out\n\nThen, the number available for rent is:\n\n250 - 200 = 50 cars\n\nYes, that matches what they want.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the rental rate. They rent out 80% of their cars, which means 20% are always available.\n\nSo, to have 50 cars available, which is 20% of the total fleet:\n\n0.20x = 50\n\nx = 50 / 0.20 = 250 cars\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, they need to purchase 50 more cars to achieve that.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Suppose they want to have 50 cars available, and they rent out 80% of their total fleet.\n\nLet me set up an equation:\n\nTotal cars = rented cars + available cars\n\nLet t = total cars\n\nRented cars = 0.80t\n\nAvailable cars = t - 0.80t = 0.20t\n\nThey want available cars = 50\n\nSo, 0.20t = 50\n\nT = 50 / 0.20 = 250 cars\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they mean that they want to have at least 50 cars available at all times, considering that they rent out 80% of their cars.\n\nIn that case, the calculation remains the same.\n\nSo, they need to have a total of 250 cars to have 50 available.\n\nSince they currently have 200 cars, they need to purchase 50 more cars.\n\nWait, but maybe there are other factors to consider. For example, perhaps there is a fluctuation in rental demand, and sometimes they rent out more or less than 80%.\n\nBut based on the information given, assuming they consistently rent out 80% of their cars, they need to have 250 cars in total to have 50 available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want to have 50 cars available in addition to the ones they are already renting out.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because they are already renting out 160 cars with 200 total, leaving 40 available.\n\nThey want to increase the available cars to 50.\n\nSo, they need to increase their total fleet.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that for every 100 cars they have, 20 are available.\n\nSo, to have 50 available, they need:\n\n50 / 0.20 = 250 cars\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want to have 50 cars available beyond what they currently have available.\n\nThey currently have 40 available, so they want an additional 50 available, making it 90 available.\n\nWait, but the question says \"to have 50 cars available for rent at all times,\" which likely means they want to have 50 cars available, not an additional 50.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation.\n\nTherefore, they need to purchase 50 more cars.\n\nBut perhaps there is a more precise way to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that they rent out 80% of their cars, so 20% are available.\n\nThey want the number of available cars to be 50.\n\nSo, 20% of total cars = 50\n\nTherefore, total cars = 50 / 0.20 = 250 cars\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they have a different rental rate, but based on the information given, assuming a consistent 80% rental rate.\n\nSo, the answer is they need to purchase 50 more cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
