        "content": "A Komodo dragon is a large species of lizard found in Indonesia. It is the largest living species of lizard, reaching lengths of up to 10 feet and weighing as much as 150 pounds. Komodo dragons are carnivorous and are known for their powerful jaws and sharp teeth, which they use to hunt and kill prey such as deer, pigs, and water buffalo. They are also known for their unique hunting techniques, which include ambushing prey and using their strong sense of smell to track down carrion. Due to habitat loss and poaching, Komodo dragons are considered a vulnerable species and are protected by law in Indonesia."
