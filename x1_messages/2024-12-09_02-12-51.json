        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this company that makes two products, A and B. Product A needs 2 hours of labor per unit, and product B needs 3 hours per unit. They have a total of 240 hours of labor available each week. The question is, if they want to allocate equal amounts of labor to both products, how many units of each can they produce?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to allocate equal amounts of labor to both products. Does that mean they spend the same number of hours on A as they do on B? I think that's what it means. So, if they have 240 hours in total and they want to split the labor equally, that means 120 hours for A and 120 hours for B.\n\nNow, for product A, which takes 2 hours per unit, how many units can they produce with 120 hours? Well, that would be 120 hours divided by 2 hours per unit, which is 60 units of A.\n\nFor product B, which takes 3 hours per unit, with 120 hours, they can produce 120 divided by 3, which is 40 units of B.\n\nSo, the company can produce 60 units of A and 40 units of B if they allocate equal amounts of labor to both.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Total labor used would be (60 units * 2 hours/unit) + (40 units * 3 hours/unit) = 120 hours + 120 hours = 240 hours, which matches the total available labor. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. If they want to allocate equal amounts of labor to both products, and they have a total of 240 hours, then dividing that equally would indeed be 120 hours each. So, my initial approach seems right.\n\nI don't think I need to consider any other constraints here, like materials or anything else, because the question only mentions labor hours. So, based on that, I think 60 units of A and 40 units of B is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ units of A and } 40 \\text{ units of B}} \\]"
