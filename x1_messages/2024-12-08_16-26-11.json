So, when you're visiting these countries, you'll need to exchange your US Dollars (USD) into their respective local currencies.\n\nFor Mexico, you'll be changing USD to MXN, and for New Zealand, you'll be changing USD to NZD. It's always a good idea to get familiar with the current exchange rates before you go, so you know how much you're getting for your money. Also, consider the fees associated with currency exchanges, as some methods might charge higher fees than others.\n\nEnjoy your travels! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
