Each plan should correspond to an evidence value, which is the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, prior evidence values, or both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nBing[input]: Allows the user to search for information using Bing search engine. It helps in locating appropriate sites that might contain the answer to the user's query.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or multiple websites from the input string containing newline separated links. Input is one or more links, and it generates plain text output containing the content of the links.\nURLGrabber[input]: Grabs links from plain text and provides a plain text, newline separated list of links.\nQuerySolver[input]: Answers questions based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a textual question referencing an #E[index] variable, like What is the population of New York, given #E1?\n\nInputs to these functions should be plain strings, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable. For instance, QuerySolver[What is the GDP of India, given #E3?]\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n#E1 = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on result of #E1]\n#E2 = [Next function to call and input parameter, which may refer to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who is the current president of Microsoft and what are some significant contributions they've made to the company?"
