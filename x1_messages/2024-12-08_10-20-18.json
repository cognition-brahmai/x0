        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we know that the factory produces 200 widgets per hour. It operates for 16 hours each day. So, to find out how many widgets it produces in one day, we can multiply the hourly production by the number of hours it operates daily.\n\nSo, daily production = 200 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day.\n\nLet me calculate that: 200 * 16 = 3,200 widgets per day.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many widgets are produced in one month, assuming there are 30 days in that month. So, monthly production would be the daily production multiplied by the number of days in the month.\n\nMonthly production = 3,200 widgets/day * 30 days/month.\n\nLet's do that math: 3,200 * 30.\n\nWell, 3,000 * 30 is 90,000, and 200 * 30 is 6,000, so added together that's 96,000 widgets per month.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 200 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day = 3,200 widgets/day. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 3,200 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 96,000 widgets/month. That also seems right.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's see:\n\nTotal hours in a month: 16 hours/day * 30 days = 480 hours/month.\n\nThen, total widgets in a month: 200 widgets/hour * 480 hours/month = 96,000 widgets/month.\n\nOkay, same answer. Or, I could consider the monthly production directly:\n\n200 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day * 30 days/month = 200 * 16 * 30.\n\nFirst, 200 * 16 is 3,200, and then 3,200 * 30 is 96,000.\n\nAlternatively, 16 * 30 = 480, and then 200 * 480 = 96,000.\n\nRegardless of the order, I keep getting 96,000 widgets per month.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Maybe maintenance breaks or downtime. But according to the problem, it operates 16 hours a day every day in the month, so no breaks.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies a 30-day month, so we don't have to worry about varying month lengths.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 96,000 widgets in one month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96000} \\]"
