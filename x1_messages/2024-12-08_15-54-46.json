        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In a room full of people, everyone shakes hands exactly once with every other person, and there were a total of 66 handshakes. I need to figure out how many people were in the room.\n\nOkay, so handshaking problem. I think this is related to combinations, where we're choosing pairs of people to shake hands. If there are n people in the room, and each shakes hands with every other person exactly once, then the total number of handshakes should be the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n, which is the combination formula C(n, 2).\n\nSo, C(n, 2) = 66.\n\nI recall that C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nTherefore, C(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n - 2)!) = (n(n - 1)(n - 2)!)/(2*1*(n - 2)!)) = (n(n - 1))/2.\n\nSo, (n(n - 1))/2 = 66.\n\nNow, I can solve for n.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: n(n - 1) = 132.\n\nSo, n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for n.\n\nI can try factoring.\n\nLook for two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to -1.\n\nLet's see, factors of 132:\n\n1 and 132, 2 and 66, 3 and 44, 4 and 33, 6 and 22, 11 and 12.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -132 and add to -1.\n\nLooking at the signs, one number must be positive and the other negative.\n\nLet's try 11 and -12.\n\n11 * -12 = -132, and 11 + (-12) = -1.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(n + 11)(n - 12) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor to zero:\n\nn + 11 = 0 \u21d2 n = -11.\n\nn - 12 = 0 \u21d2 n = 12.\n\nNow, n represents the number of people, which can't be negative, so n = 12.\n\nTherefore, there were 12 people in the room.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf there are 12 people, then C(12, 2) = (12*11)/2 = 66.\n\nYes, that matches the given number of handshakes.\n\nSo, the answer is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
