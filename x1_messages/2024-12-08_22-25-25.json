        "content": "So, let's see here. The train is traveling at different speeds for different periods of time, and I need to find out the total distance it covers. I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time, but since the speed changes, I need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, the train travels at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, for this part, the distance should be 60 miles per hour times 3 hours, which is 180 miles.\n\nThen, it slows down to 40 miles per hour for the next 2 hours. So, for this part, the distance is 40 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 80 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together: 180 miles plus 80 miles equals 260 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe by calculating the average speed for the entire journey and then multiplying by the total time. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, the total time traveled is 3 hours plus 2 hours, which is 5 hours.\n\nNow, to find the average speed, I would need the total distance divided by the total time. But I don't know the total distance yet, which is what I'm trying to find. So, that approach might not work directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the weighted average speed. The train traveled at 60 mph for 3 hours and 40 mph for 2 hours. So, the average speed could be calculated as (60 mph * 3 hours + 40 mph * 2 hours) divided by the total time, which is 5 hours.\n\nLet's do the math: (60 * 3) plus (40 * 2) is 180 plus 80, which is 260, divided by 5 hours, which gives an average speed of 52 mph.\n\nThen, the total distance would be the average speed times the total time, which is 52 mph times 5 hours, equaling 260 miles.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using graphs or something like that.\n\nWell, I could plot a graph of speed versus time, with time on the x-axis and speed on the y-axis. The area under the curve would represent the distance traveled.\n\nIn this case, the graph would have two rectangular sections: one at 60 mph for 3 hours and another at 40 mph for 2 hours.\n\nThe area of the first rectangle is 60 times 3, which is 180 miles, and the area of the second is 40 times 2, which is 80 miles. Adding them up gives 260 miles again.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 260 miles as the total distance traveled by the train.\n\nI think that's pretty conclusive. The answer should be 260 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{260} \\]"
