        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains: Train A leaving Station A heading towards Station B, and Train B leaving Station B heading towards Station A. The distance between Station A and Station B is 100 miles. Train A is going at 40 miles per hour, and Train B is going at 60 miles per hour. We need to find out how far apart they are after one hour.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much distance each train covers in one hour. Since speed is miles per hour, I can multiply the speed by the time to get the distance.\n\nFor Train A:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance A = 40 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 40 miles\n\nSo, Train A has traveled 40 miles towards Station B.\n\nFor Train B:\n\nDistance B = 60 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 60 miles\n\nTrain B has traveled 60 miles towards Station A.\n\nNow, together, in one hour, they have covered a combined distance of Distance A plus Distance B, which is 40 miles + 60 miles = 100 miles.\n\nWait a minute, the total distance between Station A and Station B is 100 miles. So, if together they have covered 100 miles in one hour, that means they should have met each other exactly after one hour.\n\nBut the question is asking how far apart they are after one hour. If they have covered a combined distance equal to the total distance between them, then they should have closed the distance completely, meaning they meet at that point.\n\nSo, the distance apart after one hour should be zero.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it differently.\n\nLet's consider their relative speed. Since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nRelative speed = Speed of Train A + Speed of Train B = 40 mph + 60 mph = 100 mph\n\nSo, their approach rate is 100 miles per hour.\n\nIn one hour, at this relative speed, they would cover 100 miles.\n\nGiven that the initial distance was 100 miles, after one hour, the remaining distance would be:\n\nInitial distance - distance covered together = 100 miles - 100 miles = 0 miles\n\nSo, they should be right next to each other, meaning zero miles apart.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Perhaps something about the times or speeds that I haven't considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about how far each train is from its starting point or something like that, but no, it specifically asks how far apart they are after one hour.\n\nAnother way to look at it: in one hour, Train A has moved 40 miles from Station A, and Train B has moved 60 miles from Station B.\n\nSo, the remaining distance between them would be the initial 100 miles minus the sum of the distances they've each traveled.\n\nWhich again is 100 - (40 + 60) = 100 - 100 = 0 miles.\n\nSo, they have closed the entire distance between them in one hour and should be meeting at that point.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that they are 0 miles apart after one hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
