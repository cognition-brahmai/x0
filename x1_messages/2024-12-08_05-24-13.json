        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a farmer who sells two types of apples: small ones for $1 each and large ones for $2 each. In one day, he sells a total of 100 apples and makes $150. We need to find out how many of each type he sold.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( s \\) represent the number of small apples sold.\n\n- Let \\( l \\) represent the number of large apples sold.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of apples sold is 100.\n\n2. The total revenue from selling these apples is $150.\n\nWe can translate these into two equations based on the given information.\n\nFrom the first point:\n\n\\[ s + l = 100 \\]\n\nThis equation represents the total quantity of apples sold.\n\nFrom the second point:\n\n\\[ 1s + 2l = 150 \\]\n\nThis equation represents the total revenue, where small apples contribute $1 each and large apples contribute $2 each to the total revenue.\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( s + l = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( s + 2l = 150 \\)\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I\u2019ll use the elimination method here because it\u2019s straightforward for this system.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ (s + 2l) - (s + l) = 150 - 100 \\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[ s + 2l - s - l = 50 \\]\n\n\\[ l = 50 \\]\n\nSo, the farmer sold 50 large apples.\n\nNow, we can substitute \\( l = 50 \\) back into the first equation to find \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s + 50 = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 100 - 50 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer sold 50 small apples and 50 large apples.\n\nWait a minute, let\u2019s double-check this because it seems a bit too straightforward. Maybe there's a better way to confirm this answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the substitution method. From the first equation:\n\n\\[ s = 100 - l \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( s \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ (100 - l) + 2l = 150 \\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - l + 2l = 150 \\]\n\n\\[ 100 + l = 150 \\]\n\n\\[ l = 150 - 100 \\]\n\n\\[ l = 50 \\]\n\nAgain, we get \\( l = 50 \\), and then \\( s = 100 - 50 = 50 \\).\n\nHmm, both methods give the same answer. Maybe I should check if this makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nLet\u2019s verify the total revenue:\n\n- 50 small apples at $1 each: \\( 50 \\times 1 = 50 \\) dollars.\n\n- 50 large apples at $2 each: \\( 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\n- Total revenue: \\( 50 + 100 = 150 \\) dollars.\n\nThis matches the given total revenue. Also, the total number of apples is \\( 50 + 50 = 100 \\), which matches the total quantity sold.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the farmer sold 50 small apples and 50 large apples.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let\u2019s consider if there could be other possible solutions. For example, if the farmer sold more small apples and fewer large apples, would it still add up to $150?\n\nSuppose the farmer sold 60 small apples and 40 large apples:\n\n- 60 small apples: \\( 60 \\times 1 = 60 \\) dollars.\n\n- 40 large apples: \\( 40 \\times 2 = 80 \\) dollars.\n\n- Total: \\( 60 + 80 = 140 \\) dollars, which is less than $150.\n\nAlternatively, if he sold 40 small apples and 60 large apples:\n\n- 40 small apples: \\( 40 \\times 1 = 40 \\) dollars.\n\n- 60 large apples: \\( 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\n- Total: \\( 40 + 120 = 160 \\) dollars, which is more than $150.\n\nSo, selling 50 of each type is the only combination that exactly meets the total revenue of $150 and the total quantity of 100 apples.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the average price per apple. Total revenue is $150 for 100 apples, so the average price per apple is \\( 150 / 100 = 1.50 \\) dollars.\n\nSince small apples are $1 and large are $2, the average price of $1.50 suggests an equal mix of both, which aligns with our solution of 50 small and 50 large apples.\n\nAlternatively, we could set up the problem using weights or ratios, but the straightforward algebraic approach seems sufficient here.\n\nIn conclusion, the farmer sold 50 small apples and 50 large apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ small apples and } 50 \\text{ large apples}} \\]"
