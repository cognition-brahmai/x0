        "content": "Let's see. So, the bacteria population doubles every 20 minutes, and we want to know how many times it will have doubled after 3 hours. First, I need to figure out how many 20-minute intervals there are in 3 hours.\n\nOkay, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 times 60, which is 180 minutes. Now, to find out how many 20-minute periods are in 180 minutes, I can divide 180 by 20.\n\n180 divided by 20 is 9. So, the bacteria population will double 9 times in 3 hours.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if that makes sense. If it doubles every 20 minutes, then after 20 minutes it doubles once, after 40 minutes it doubles twice, and so on, up to 180 minutes. Let's list it out to be sure.\n\n- 20 minutes: doubles once\n\n- 40 minutes: doubles twice\n\n- 60 minutes: doubles three times\n\n- 80 minutes: doubles four times\n\n- 100 minutes: doubles five times\n\n- 120 minutes: doubles six times\n\n- 140 minutes: doubles seven times\n\n- 160 minutes: doubles eight times\n\n- 180 minutes: doubles nine times\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier. So, the population doubles 9 times in 3 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to look at this. For example, using the formula for exponential growth. The general formula for exponential growth is N = N0 * 2^(t/T), where:\n\n- N is the final population size\n\n- N0 is the initial population size\n\n- t is the time elapsed\n\n- T is the doubling time\n\nIn this case, t is 3 hours, and T is 20 minutes. But actually, the question is not asking for the final population size, but rather how many times it has doubled. So, perhaps my initial approach is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the number of doubling periods in the total time. Again, that brings me back to dividing the total time by the doubling time, which is what I did earlier.\n\nLet me consider if there's any trick here that I'm missing. For example, does the population double at time zero? Well, at time zero, the population is just starting, so I wouldn't count that as a doubling event. The first doubling happens after 20 minutes, the second after 40 minutes, and so on, up to 180 minutes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each doubling period is independent, and they accumulate over time. So, in 180 minutes, with each period being 20 minutes, there are 9 periods, meaning 9 doublings.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The population doubles 9 times in 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
