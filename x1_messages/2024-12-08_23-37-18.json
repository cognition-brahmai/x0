        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an online store selling books and CDs. The price of a book is three times that of a CD. Someone bought 10 items for $100, and we need to figure out how many books and CDs they bought. Interesting!\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of CDs bought.\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of books bought.\n\nWe know that the total number of items bought is 10, so:\n\n\\( c + b = 10 \\)\n\nNext, let\u2019s think about the prices. Let\u2019s assume the price of one CD is \\( p \\) dollars. Then, since a book costs three times that, the price of one book is \\( 3p \\) dollars.\n\nNow, the total cost of the CDs would be \\( c \\times p \\), and the total cost of the books would be \\( b \\times 3p \\). The total amount spent is $100, so:\n\n\\( c \\times p + b \\times 3p = 100 \\)\n\nWe can factor out \\( p \\) from both terms:\n\n\\( p(c + 3b) = 100 \\)\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( c + b = 10 \\)\n\n2. \\( p(c + 3b) = 100 \\)\n\nWe have three variables here: \\( c \\), \\( b \\), and \\( p \\). But we only have two equations, which means we have one degree of freedom. However, since we're dealing with a real-world problem, some constraints apply.\n\nFirst, \\( c \\) and \\( b \\) must be non-negative integers because you can't buy a negative number of items or a fraction of an item.\n\nAlso, \\( p \\) must be a positive real number because prices can't be zero or negative.\n\nLet\u2019s see if we can express one variable in terms of another to simplify this.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\( c = 10 - b \\)\n\nNow, plug this into equation 2:\n\n\\( p((10 - b) + 3b) = 100 \\)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\( p(10 - b + 3b) = p(10 + 2b) = 100 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( p = \\frac{100}{10 + 2b} \\)\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n\\( p = \\frac{100}{2(5 + b)} = \\frac{50}{5 + b} \\)\n\nNow, since \\( p \\) must be positive, and \\( b \\) is a non-negative integer, \\( 5 + b \\) must be a positive integer divisor of 50 for \\( p \\) to be a positive real number.\n\nWait, but actually, \\( 5 + b \\) must be a positive integer that divides 50, but since \\( b \\) is a non-negative integer, \\( 5 + b \\) can take on integer values starting from 5 upwards.\n\nLet\u2019s consider possible integer values for \\( b \\) (number of books), and see what \\( p \\) would be.\n\nPossible values for \\( b \\):\n\nSince \\( b \\) is a non-negative integer and \\( c = 10 - b \\) must also be non-negative, \\( b \\) can range from 0 to 10.\n\nLet\u2019s try different integer values for \\( b \\) from 0 to 10 and see which ones give us a positive real number for \\( p \\), and whether those values make sense in the context of the problem.\n\nStarting with \\( b = 0 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 0} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10 \\) dollars per CD.\n\nThen, \\( c = 10 - 0 = 10 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal cost: \\( 10 \\) CDs \\(\\times\\) \\( 10 \\) dollars/CD = \\( 100 \\) dollars.\n\nBut wait, books cost three times as much as CDs, which would be \\( 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\) dollars per book.\n\nBut in this scenario, since \\( b = 0 \\), there are no books, so the total cost is just from CDs, which checks out.\n\nSo, one possible solution is 0 books and 10 CDs.\n\nIs that realistic? Well, it\u2019s possible, but maybe not what was intended if the problem expects both books and CDs to be purchased.\n\nNext, \\( b = 1 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 1} = \\frac{50}{6} \\approx 8.333 \\) dollars per CD.\n\nThen, \\( c = 10 - 1 = 9 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal cost from CDs: \\( 9 \\times 8.333 \\approx 75 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal cost from books: \\( 1 \\times 3 \\times 8.333 \\approx 25 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 75 + 25 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nThis works mathematically.\n\nProceeding to \\( b = 2 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 2} = \\frac{50}{7} \\approx 7.142 \\) dollars per CD.\n\n\\( c = 10 - 2 = 8 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal from CDs: \\( 8 \\times 7.142 \\approx 57.14 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal from books: \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 7.142 \\approx 42.86 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 57.14 + 42.86 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nAgain, mathematically sound.\n\nContinuing to \\( b = 3 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 3} = \\frac{50}{8} = 6.25 \\) dollars per CD.\n\n\\( c = 10 - 3 = 7 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal from CDs: \\( 7 \\times 6.25 = 43.75 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal from books: \\( 3 \\times 3 \\times 6.25 = 56.25 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 43.75 + 56.25 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nStill valid.\n\n\\( b = 4 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 4} = \\frac{50}{9} \\approx 5.555 \\) dollars per CD.\n\n\\( c = 10 - 4 = 6 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal from CDs: \\( 6 \\times 5.555 \\approx 33.33 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal from books: \\( 4 \\times 3 \\times 5.555 \\approx 66.67 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 33.33 + 66.67 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nValid.\n\n\\( b = 5 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 5} = \\frac{50}{10} = 5 \\) dollars per CD.\n\n\\( c = 10 - 5 = 5 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal from CDs: \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal from books: \\( 5 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 75 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 25 + 75 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nValid.\n\n\\( b = 6 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 6} = \\frac{50}{11} \\approx 4.545 \\) dollars per CD.\n\n\\( c = 10 - 6 = 4 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal from CDs: \\( 4 \\times 4.545 \\approx 18.18 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal from books: \\( 6 \\times 3 \\times 4.545 \\approx 81.82 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 18.18 + 81.82 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nValid.\n\n\\( b = 7 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 7} = \\frac{50}{12} \\approx 4.167 \\) dollars per CD.\n\n\\( c = 10 - 7 = 3 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal from CDs: \\( 3 \\times 4.167 \\approx 12.50 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal from books: \\( 7 \\times 3 \\times 4.167 \\approx 87.50 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 12.50 + 87.50 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nValid.\n\n\\( b = 8 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 8} = \\frac{50}{13} \\approx 3.846 \\) dollars per CD.\n\n\\( c = 10 - 8 = 2 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal from CDs: \\( 2 \\times 3.846 \\approx 7.69 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal from books: \\( 8 \\times 3 \\times 3.846 \\approx 92.31 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 7.69 + 92.31 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nValid.\n\n\\( b = 9 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 9} = \\frac{50}{14} \\approx 3.571 \\) dollars per CD.\n\n\\( c = 10 - 9 = 1 \\) CD.\n\nTotal from CDs: \\( 1 \\times 3.571 \\approx 3.57 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal from books: \\( 9 \\times 3 \\times 3.571 \\approx 96.43 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 3.57 + 96.43 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nValid.\n\n\\( b = 10 \\):\n\n\\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + 10} = \\frac{50}{15} \\approx 3.333 \\) dollars per CD.\n\n\\( c = 10 - 10 = 0 \\) CDs.\n\nTotal from CDs: \\( 0 \\times 3.333 = 0 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal from books: \\( 10 \\times 3 \\times 3.333 \\approx 100 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal: \\( 0 + 100 = 100 \\) dollars.\n\nValid.\n\nSo, mathematically, all integer values of \\( b \\) from 0 to 10 are possible solutions, as long as \\( c = 10 - b \\), and \\( p = \\frac{50}{5 + b} \\).\n\nBut, from a realism perspective, it might be unlikely to have scenarios where someone buys only books or only CDs, but it's possible. However, if we assume that the person bought a mix of both, then \\( b \\) from 1 to 9 would be more realistic.\n\nMoreover, the price of CDs ranging from approximately $3.33 to $10.00 might be realistic, depending on the type of CDs and books sold by the store.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple possible solutions:\n\n1. 0 books and 10 CDs, with CDs costing $10 each.\n\n2. 1 book and 9 CDs, with CDs costing approximately $8.33 each.\n\n3. 2 books and 8 CDs, with CDs costing approximately $7.14 each.\n\n4. 3 books and 7 CDs, with CDs costing $6.25 each.\n\n5. 4 books and 6 CDs, with CDs costing approximately $5.56 each.\n\n6. 5 books and 5 CDs, with CDs costing $5.00 each.\n\n7. 6 books and 4 CDs, with CDs costing approximately $4.55 each.\n\n8. 7 books and 3 CDs, with CDs costing approximately $4.17 each.\n\n9. 8 books and 2 CDs, with CDs costing approximately $3.85 each.\n\n10. 9 books and 1 CD, with CDs costing approximately $3.57 each.\n\n11. 10 books and 0 CDs, with CDs costing approximately $3.33 each.\n\nAll these scenarios satisfy the given conditions.\n\nHowever, if there are additional constraints not mentioned in the problem, such as the store having a minimum or maximum price for CDs or books, or the person buying at least one of each type of item, then some of these solutions might not be applicable.\n\nIn the absence of such constraints, all these solutions are mathematically valid and reasonably realistic.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is that the person bought a combination of books and CDs ranging from 0 to 10 books, with the corresponding number of CDs, and the price of CDs adjusted accordingly to meet the total cost of $100.\n\nBut if I had to pick one that seems most balanced, perhaps buying 5 books and 5 CDs, with CDs costing $5 each and books costing $15 each, might be the most straightforward and realistic option.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Multiple solutions exist, including but not limited to: } (b, c) = (0,10), (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4), (7,3), (8,2), (9,1), (10,0)}"
