The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in other countries. \nWhich of the following countries does NOT contain a significant portion of the Amazon rainforest?\nA.

        "content": "Let's see here. The Amazon rainforest is mostly in South America, right? And it covers a huge area, like 5.5 million square kilometers. The passage says it includes parts of nine countries, with most of it in Brazil, then Peru, Colombia, and some in other countries.\n\nSo, the question is asking which country doesn't have a significant portion of the Amazon rainforest. The options are Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, and \"None of the above.\"\n\nHmm, Brazil has 60% of the rainforest, Peru has 13%, and Colombia has 10%. That adds up to 83%. What about the other countries? The passage mentions that the majority is in Brazil, followed by Peru and Colombia, and \"minor amounts in other countries.\" So, which other countries are included in the Amazon basin?\n\nI know that the Amazon basin includes territory from nine nations: Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. So, Argentina isn't even one of the nine countries that the Amazon basin covers.\n\nLooking back at the options, Argentina is listed, and since it's not one of the nine countries in the Amazon basin, it doesn't have a significant portion of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Argentina.\n\nBut, to make sure, let's think about it again. Brazil has 60%, Peru 13%, Colombia 10%, and the remaining 17% is divided among the other six countries. So, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana have smaller portions.\n\nArgentina isn't even in the list, so it doesn't have any part of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Argentina.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
