It's about believing in your friends, even when they don't believe in themselves. Just like how Snoopy always stands by me, even when I kick the football and it never works out. Friends are like that\u2014they support you through thick and thin, and they never give up on you, even when you might give up on yourself. It's a special bond that goes beyond words; it's about actions and being there in the moments that matter. So, in the end, true friendship is about loyalty, understanding, and never letting your friends down."
