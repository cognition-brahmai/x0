        "content": "So the factory produces 100 cars every day, but it only operates 6 days a week, taking Sundays off. I need to find out how many cars it produces in a year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days a year the factory is operating. Since it works 6 days a week and takes one day off each week, I can calculate the number of operating days in a year.\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year, so:\n\nOperating days per week = 6\n\nTotal operating days in a year = 6 days/week * 52 weeks/year = 312 days/year\n\nBut wait, that might not account for all the days in a year because 52 weeks only account for 364 days (52 weeks * 7 days/week = 364 days), and there are 365 days in a non-leap year, or 366 in a leap year.\n\nSo, I should consider the total number of days in a year and subtract the Sundays.\n\nTotal days in a year = 365 (assuming it's not a leap year)\n\nNumber of Sundays in a year = 52 (since there are 52 weeks)\n\nTherefore, operating days = 365 - 52 = 313 days\n\nWait, but that doesn't account for the fact that sometimes there are 53 Sundays in a year. So, to be more accurate, I should consider that the number of Sundays can be 52 or 53, depending on the year.\n\nBut to simplify, maybe I can assume that on average, there are 52 Sundays in a year.\n\nSo, operating days = 365 - 52 = 313 days\n\nAlternatively, using the weeks:\n\n52 weeks * 6 days/week = 312 days\n\nPlus, there is one extra day in the year, making it 313 operating days (if that extra day is not a Sunday).\n\nBut to be precise, I need to consider whether the extra day is a Sunday or not.\n\nLet's assume it's not a Sunday, so operating days = 313\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate based on the number of weeks.\n\nTotal weeks in a year = 52\n\nOperating days per week = 6\n\nSo, total operating days = 52 * 6 = 312 days\n\nBut there are 365 days in a year, so there are 365 - 312 = 53 days off, which includes Sundays and possibly other days.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 52 Sundays would be 52 days off, and 365 - 52 = 313 operating days.\n\nBut if the factory operates 6 days a week, it should be 52 weeks * 6 days = 312 days.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of one day.\n\nPerhaps it's simpler to consider that in a non-leap year, the factory operates on all days except Sundays, which amounts to 365 - 52 = 313 days.\n\nBut if it operates 6 days a week, that's 312 days, as 52 weeks * 6 days = 312 days.\n\nSo, perhaps there is one additional operating day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory takes an extra day off in the year.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nTo simplify, I'll assume that the factory operates 6 days a week, 52 weeks a year, which is 312 days, and ignore the extra day for now.\n\nNow, the factory produces 100 cars each operating day.\n\nSo, total car production in a year = 100 cars/day * 312 days/year = 31,200 cars/year\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it might be 313 days, which would be 100 * 313 = 31,300 cars.\n\nSo, depending on how you account for the extra day in the year, the production could be either 31,200 or 31,300 cars.\n\nTo be more precise, I should consider that a non-leap year has 365 days, and 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day.\n\nSo, there are 52 Sundays plus one extra day, which might or might not be a Sunday, depending on the starting day of the year.\n\nIf the extra day is not a Sunday, then the factory operates on that day, making it 313 operating days.\n\nIf the extra day is a Sunday, then it's a day off, so operating days remain 312.\n\nBut determining whether the extra day is a Sunday or not requires knowing the specific year.\n\nSince the question doesn't specify a particular year, I'll assume it's a non-leap year with 365 days, and the extra day is not a Sunday, leading to 313 operating days.\n\nTherefore, total car production = 100 cars/day * 313 days/year = 31,300 cars/year\n\nAlternatively, if the extra day is a Sunday, then operating days are 312, and production is 31,200 cars.\n\nBut without specific information, I'll go with 31,300 cars as the annual production.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31300} \\]"
