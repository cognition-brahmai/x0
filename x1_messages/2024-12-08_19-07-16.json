        "content": "Let's tackle this marble problem step by step. So, we've got a bag with red, blue, and green marbles. The ratios given are:\n\n- The ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:4.\n\n- The ratio of blue to green marbles is 2:5.\n\nAnd we're told there are 20 blue marbles. We need to find the total number of marbles.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how these ratios relate to each other. We have two separate ratios involving blue marbles. To combine them, I should express all three colors in terms of a common ratio.\n\nLet's start with the red to blue ratio, which is 3:4. That means for every 3 red marbles, there are 4 blue marbles.\n\nSeparately, the blue to green ratio is 2:5, meaning for every 2 blue marbles, there are 5 green marbles.\n\nTo combine these, I need to make the number of blue marbles in both ratios the same. Right now, in the red to blue ratio, blue is 4, and in the blue to green ratio, blue is 2. The least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4.\n\nSo, I'll adjust the blue to green ratio to match 4 blue marbles. If 2 blue marbles correspond to 5 green marbles, then 4 blue marbles would correspond to \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) green marbles.\n\nNow, with blue marbles set to 4 in both ratios, I can combine them:\n\n- Red:Blue:Green = 3:4:10\n\nThis means for every 3 red, 4 blue, and 10 green marbles, the ratios hold.\n\nBut we know there are actually 20 blue marbles. So, I need to scale up the ratio accordingly.\n\nIn the ratio, blue has 4 parts, but in reality, there are 20 blue marbles. So, the scaling factor is \\( \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, multiply each part of the ratio by 5:\n\n- Red: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n\n- Blue: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n\n- Green: \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\)\n\nNow, to find the total number of marbles, add them all up:\n\n\\(15 + 20 + 50 = 85\\)\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the ratio is 3:4:10, and blue is 20, scaling by 5 makes sense. So, red is 15, blue is 20, green is 50, total 85.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's see.\n\nGiven the ratio of red to blue is 3:4, and blue to green is 2:5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express all ratios in terms of red, blue, and green.\n\nGiven red:blue = 3:4, and blue:green = 2:5.\n\nTo combine them, I need to express blue in terms that are compatible.\n\nSo, red:blue = 3:4\n\nBlue:green = 2:5\n\nTo combine, make blue the same in both ratios.\n\nMultiply the first ratio by 2 and the second ratio by 4 to make blue equal:\n\nRed:blue = 3\u00d72 : 4\u00d72 = 6:8\n\nBlue:green = 2\u00d74 : 5\u00d74 = 8:20\n\nNow, combined ratio is red:blue:green = 6:8:20\n\nSimplify by dividing each by 2:\n\n3:4:10\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, with blue = 4 parts, and actual blue = 20, scaling factor is 5.\n\nThus, red = 3\u00d75=15, green=10\u00d75=50, total=15+20+50=85.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use proportions.\n\nGiven red:blue = 3:4, and blue =20, then red = (3/4)*20 = 15.\n\nSimilarly, blue:green = 2:5, and blue=20, then green = (5/2)*20 = 50.\n\nTotal = 15+20+50=85.\n\nWait, but in the blue:green ratio, if blue is 2 parts and green is 5 parts, then when blue is 20, green should be (5/2)*20=50.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of least common multiple again.\n\nThe ratios are red:blue = 3:4 and blue:green = 2:5.\n\nThe blue in the first ratio is 4, and in the second is 2.\n\nLCM of 4 and 2 is 4, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, adjust the second ratio to have blue as 4.\n\nBlue:green = 2:5 => 4:10.\n\nSo, combined ratio red:blue:green = 3:4:10.\n\nScaling by 5, total is 85.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of blue marbles and find the total based on that.\n\nGiven that blue is 4 parts in the combined ratio, and actual blue is 20,\n\nSo, each part is 20/4 = 5.\n\nThen, red is 3 parts, so 3\u00d75=15.\n\nGreen is 10 parts, so 10\u00d75=50.\n\nTotal: 15+20+50=85.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the total ratio parts.\n\nRed:blue:green = 3:4:10.\n\nTotal parts: 3+4+10=17 parts.\n\nIf blue is 4 parts and equals 20 marbles, then each part is 20/4=5 marbles.\n\nTherefore, total marbles = 17 parts \u00d7 5 marbles/part = 85 marbles.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total ratio parts directly.\n\nGiven the ratio 3:4:10, total parts are 17.\n\nIf blue has 20 marbles, which correspond to 4 parts,\n\nThen, total marbles = (20 / 4) \u00d7 17 = 5 \u00d7 17 = 85.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion that there are 85 marbles in total.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I should consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I set up equations based on the ratios.\n\nLet r be the number of red marbles, b be blue, and g be green.\n\nGiven:\n\nr/b = 3/4 => r = (3/4)b\n\nb/g = 2/5 => g = (5/2)b\n\nGiven b = 20,\n\nThen r = (3/4)*20 = 15\n\ng = (5/2)*20 = 50\n\nTotal = 15 + 20 + 50 = 85\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of proportions or cross-multiplication.\n\nGiven r:b = 3:4, and b =20,\n\nThen r = (3/4)*20 = 15\n\nSimilarly, b:g = 2:5, and b=20,\n\nThen g = (5/2)*20 = 50\n\nTotal = 15 + 20 + 50 = 85\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nI think it's consistent across multiple methods. Therefore, the total number of marbles is 85.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{85} \\]"
