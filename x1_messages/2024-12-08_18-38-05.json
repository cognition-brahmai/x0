        "content": "Let's see. I have these statements about cryptography, and I need to figure out which one is correct. So, first things first, what's cryptography? It's a way to protect information and communications by turning regular text into code that only certain people can understand. There are different types of cryptography, like symmetric-key and public-key.\n\nSymmetric-key cryptography is when both the person sending the message and the person receiving it use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the message. It's like having a secret code that only you and your friend know. Public-key cryptography is different because it uses two keys: a public key, which anyone can use to encrypt a message to you, and a private key that only you have to decrypt those messages.\n\nOkay, so let's look at statement A: \"Symmetric-key cryptography is less secure than public-key cryptography.\" Hmm, is that true? Well, symmetric-key cryptography can be very secure, especially with strong algorithms and long keys. Public-key cryptography has the advantage of not needing to share a secret key over a potentially insecure channel, which can be a security risk in symmetric-key systems. But overall, both can be secure; it just depends on how they're implemented.\n\nSo, I don't think A is necessarily correct.\n\nStatement B says, \"In symmetric-key cryptography, the sender and the receiver do not share the same key.\" That's directly opposite to what I know about symmetric-key cryptography. By definition, they do share the same key. So, B is definitely false.\n\nStatement C: \"The process of converting ciphertext into plaintext is known as decryption.\" That sounds right. Ciphertext is the encrypted message, and decryption is the process of turning it back into plaintext, which is the original readable message.\n\nStatement D: \"Public-key cryptography uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.\" Wait, that's not correct. In public-key cryptography, there are two different keys: the public key for encryption and the private key for decryption. They are mathematically related but not the same.\n\nSo, D is false.\n\nThat leaves me with C as the correct statement. Let me double-check.\n\nA is questionable; security depends on implementation.\n\nB is false.\n\nC is correct.\n\nD is false.\n\nE is \"None of the above,\" but since C is correct, E isn't the answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The process of converting ciphertext into plaintext is known as decryption.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
