        "content": "So in this classroom, there are 12 boys and 8 girls. The problem says that every boy shakes hands with every other boy once, and every girl shakes hands with every other girl once. We need to find out the total number of handshakes that occur.\n\nFirst, let's think about the boys. There are 12 boys, and each one shakes hands with every other boy exactly once. So, for the boys, we need to figure out how many unique pairs of boys there are, because each pair represents one handshake.\n\nSimilarly, for the girls, there are 8 girls, and each one shakes hands with every other girl exactly once. So, we'll need to find out how many unique pairs of girls there are, which will give us the number of handshakes among the girls.\n\nFinally, we'll add the number of handshakes among the boys and the number of handshakes among the girls to get the total number of handshakes in the classroom.\n\nLet's start with the boys. To find out how many unique pairs of boys there are, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is used to find out how many ways we can choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order of selection. The formula is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, we want to choose 2 boys out of 12 to form a handshake pair. So, n = 12 and k = 2.\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the 10! in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 handshakes among the boys.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the girls. There are 8 girls, and we need to find out how many unique pairs of girls there are.\n\nAgain, using the combination formula with n = 8 and k = 2:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 28 handshakes among the girls.\n\nNow, to find the total number of handshakes in the classroom, we add the handshakes among the boys and the handshakes among the girls:\n\n\\[\n66 + 28 = 94\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes that occur in the classroom is 94.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that handshakes only occur between boys and between girls, not between boys and girls. So, the total number of handshakes is simply the sum of the handshakes among boys and the handshakes among girls, which is what I've calculated.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the total number of possible handshakes if everyone shakes hands with everyone else, and then subtract the handshakes between boys and girls, that should give us the same result.\n\nFirst, the total number of handshakes if everyone shakes hands with everyone else would be:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times 18!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nThen, the number of handshakes between boys and girls would be:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 8 = 96\n\\]\n\nSo, if we subtract the handshakes between boys and girls from the total handshakes, we get:\n\n\\[\n190 - 96 = 94\n\\]\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation, so it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each boy shakes hands with 11 other boys (since there are 12 boys in total, and he doesn't shake hands with himself), and each girl shakes hands with 7 other girls. So, the total number of handshakes among boys would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nWe divide by 2 because each handshake is counted twice if we simply multiply 12 by 11 (once for each participant).\n\nSimilarly, for the girls:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nAgain, adding these up gives us 66 + 28 = 94.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 94 as the total number of handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 94.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{94} \\]"
