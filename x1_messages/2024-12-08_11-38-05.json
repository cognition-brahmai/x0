        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the man buys a car for $20,000 and sells it after two years for $15,000. That means on the first transaction, he bought for $20,000 and sold for $15,000. So, what's his loss on the first transaction?\n\nLoss = Cost Price - Selling Price\n\nSo, Loss = $20,000 - $15,000 = $5,000\n\nOkay, so he lost $5,000 on the first car.\n\nThen, he buys another car for $25,000 and sells it after another two years for $20,000. Again, let's calculate the loss on the second transaction.\n\nLoss = Cost Price - Selling Price\n\nLoss = $25,000 - $20,000 = $5,000\n\nSo, on the second transaction, he also lost $5,000.\n\nNow, to find his net loss or gain on both transactions, we need to add up all his losses and gains.\n\nFrom the first transaction: Loss of $5,000\n\nFrom the second transaction: Loss of $5,000\n\nTotal Loss = $5,000 + $5,000 = $10,000\n\nSo, his net loss on both transactions is $10,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe by considering the total amount spent and the total amount gained.\n\nTotal amount spent: First car $20,000 + Second car $25,000 = $45,000\n\nTotal amount gained: First sale $15,000 + Second sale $20,000 = $35,000\n\nNet result: Total gained - Total spent = $35,000 - $45,000 = -$10,000\n\nWhich is a loss of $10,000. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if he had gained money on any transaction, I would have added gains and subtracted losses, but in this case, it's all losses.\n\nSo, final answer: Net loss of $10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-10000} \\]\n"
