So, I need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nWell, if each person contributes $8, and the total cost is $120, then the number of people should be the total cost divided by the amount each person contributes. So, that would be 120 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do the math: 120 \u00f7 8 = 15.\n\nSo, there are 15 people in the group.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If 15 people each contribute $8, that should total $120.\n\n15 times 8 is indeed 120. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as finding the value of n in the equation 8n = 120, where n is the number of people.\n\nSolving for n: n = 120 / 8 = 15.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
