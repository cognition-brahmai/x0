At a corner table, JASON, a laid-back tech enthusiast in his late 20s, sits across from his best friend, MIKE, a charismatic journalism student with a curious twinkle in his eye.\n\nJason is fidgeting with his cup, avoiding eye contact, while Mike sips his coffee, sensing something's off.\n\nMIKE\n(Noticing Jason's unease)\nDude, you okay? You've been acting weird all morning.\n\nJason takes a deep breath, steeling himself.\n\nJASON\nI need to tell you something, Mike. Something big.\n\nMike's curiosity piqued, he leans in.\n\nMIKE\nSpill it, man. What's going on?\n\nJason looks around, making sure no one's listening, then leans in conspiratorially.\n\nJASON\nRemember that superhero, Nightwing? The one who's been taking down criminals and saving the city?\n\nMike nods, smiling.\n\nMIKE\nYeah, he's pretty badass. Wait, where are you going with this?\n\nJASON\n(sighs)\nI... I'm Nightwing.\n\nThe words hang in the air between them. Mike's expression shifts from amusement to confusion, then to disbelief.\n\nMIKE\n(skeptical)\nWhat? No way, Jason. That can't be possible.\n\nJason reaches into his backpack and pulls out a dark hooded cloak and a mask, placing them on the table.\n\nJASON\nIt's true, Mike. I've been Nightwing for over a year now.\n\nMike picks up the mask, examining it closely.\n\nMIKE\nThis looks real. But why are you telling me now?\n\nJASON\nBecause I need your help. There's something big coming up, and I need someone I can trust.\n\nMike puts down the mask, looking Jason straight in the eye.\n\nMIKE\nTrust? You mean trust that you're actually Nightwing? Or trust with whatever mission you have?\n\nJASON\nBoth, Mike. I need you to believe me and help me with this.\n\nMike takes a moment, processing the information.\n\nMIKE\nAlright, let's say I believe you. What do you need from me?\n\nJason looks relieved.\n\nJASON\nI need you to look into a lead for me. There's a criminal organization planning something big, and I need to stop them.\n\nMIKE\n(nodding)\nOkay, I can do that. But, Jason, this is huge. Are you sure about this?\n\nJASON\nAbsolutely. I trust you, Mike. You're my best friend.\n\nMike smiles, a mix of excitement and nerves.\n\nMIKE\nAlright, let's do this. But promise me one thing.\n\nJASON\nWhat's that?\n\nMIKE\nKeep me safe. I don't want to end up in trouble because of this.\n\nJASON\nI promise, Mike. Your safety is my top priority.\n\nMike nods, accepting the terms.\n\nMIKE\nAlright, let's get to work then.\n\nAs they start discussing the details, the coffee shop continues its usual bustle, unaware of the extraordinary secret shared between the two friends.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nEnd of Scene."
