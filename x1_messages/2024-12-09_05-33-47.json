        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train's average speed. Let's see what it says. The train travels at 60 km/h for the first hour, then speeds up to 80 km/h for the next two hours. I need to find the average speed over these three hours.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, I should find out how far the train went in each part of the journey and then add those distances up, then divide by the total time.\n\nOkay, for the first hour, the train is going at 60 km/h. So, distance equals speed times time. That means 60 km/h times 1 hour, which is 60 kilometers.\n\nNext, for the next two hours, the train is going faster, at 80 km/h. So, distance is 80 km/h times 2 hours, which is 160 kilometers.\n\nNow, total distance is 60 km plus 160 km, which is 220 kilometers.\n\nTotal time is 1 hour plus 2 hours, which is 3 hours.\n\nSo, average speed is total distance divided by total time: 220 km divided by 3 hours. Let's do that calculation.\n\n220 divided by 3 is... hmm, 3 goes into 220 seventy-three times with a remainder. 3 times 73 is 219, so 220 minus 219 is 1, so it's 73 and one-third km/h.\n\nWait, but I should probably express it as a decimal. Let's see, 1 divided by 3 is approximately 0.333, so 73.333 km/h.\n\nBut, to be precise, I can leave it as 73.3 recurring, or maybe round it to 73.3 km/h.\n\nAlternatively, I can keep it as a fraction: 220/3 km/h.\n\nBut I think the question might expect a decimal answer.\n\nSo, the average speed is approximately 73.3 km/h.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst part: 60 km/h for 1 hour \u2192 60 km.\n\nSecond part: 80 km/h for 2 hours \u2192 160 km.\n\nTotal distance: 60 + 160 = 220 km.\n\nTotal time: 1 + 2 = 3 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 220 \u00f7 3 = 73.333... km/h.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it using weights. Since the train traveled longer at 80 km/h, it makes sense that the average is closer to 80 than to 60.\n\nLet's see, 60 and two times 80 is 160, so total 220, divided by 3, yep.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{73.\\overline{3} \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
