        "content": "So you have 10 cats and 20 dogs, and you want to know the total number of legs. Let's figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to know how many legs each animal has. Typically, both cats and dogs have 4 legs each.\n\nSo, for the cats:\n\nNumber of cats: 10\n\nLegs per cat: 4\n\nTotal legs from cats: 10 cats * 4 legs/cat = 40 legs\n\nNext, for the dogs:\n\nNumber of dogs: 20\n\nLegs per dog: 4\n\nTotal legs from dogs: 20 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 80 legs\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs from both cats and dogs, we add the two totals together:\n\nTotal legs = legs from cats + legs from dogs = 40 legs + 80 legs = 120 legs\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about this again. I just assumed that all cats and dogs have 4 legs each, which is usually the case. But it's possible that some animals might have fewer legs due to injuries or birth defects. However, since no such information is provided, it's reasonable to assume that all animals have the typical number of legs.\n\nAlso, we should consider whether there are any other animals or humans involved, but based on the information given, it's just cats and dogs.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the legs include the owner's legs. If we're counting all the legs in the environment, we might need to include the owner's legs as well. But since the question specifies \"10 cats and 20 dogs,\" it might be focusing only on the animals mentioned.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider both scenarios:\n\n1. Counting only the legs of the cats and dogs:\n\nTotal legs = 40 (from cats) + 80 (from dogs) = 120 legs\n\n2. Including the owner's legs (assuming the owner has 2 legs):\n\nTotal legs = 120 (from animals) + 2 (from owner) = 122 legs\n\nHowever, since the question specifically mentions \"10 cats and 20 dogs,\" it's likely that we should consider only their legs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 120.\n\nBut to be completely sure, let's verify the calculations again.\n\nNumber of cats: 10\n\nLegs per cat: 4\n\nTotal legs from cats: 10 * 4 = 40\n\nNumber of dogs: 20\n\nLegs per dog: 4\n\nTotal legs from dogs: 20 * 4 = 80\n\nTotal legs: 40 + 80 = 120\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as:\n\nTotal animals: 10 cats + 20 dogs = 30 animals\n\nLegs per animal: 4\n\nTotal legs: 30 * 4 = 120 legs\n\nThis matches our previous calculation.\n\nI think we can confidently say that there are 120 legs in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
