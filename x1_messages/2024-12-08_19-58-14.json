        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (4^2) * (3^3) divided by (6*2). First, I need to calculate each part separately.\n\nSo, 4 raised to the power of 2 is 4 * 4, which equals 16.\n\nNext, 3 raised to the power of 3 is 3 * 3 * 3, which is 27.\n\nNow, multiplying those results: 16 * 27. Let's see, 16 * 20 is 320, and 16 * 7 is 112, so together that's 320 + 112 = 432.\n\nThen, 6 * 2 is 12.\n\nSo now, I have to divide 432 by 12. 12 times 36 is 432, so the answer should be 36.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 12 * 30 = 360, and 12 * 6 = 72, so 360 + 72 is 432. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
