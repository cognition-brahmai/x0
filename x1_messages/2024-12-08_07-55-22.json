        "content": "I'm not sure which specific river you're referring to, but one of the largest rivers in North America that flows through or borders multiple states and provinces is the Mississippi River. It's the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent. The river flows through or along the borders of ten U.S. states, from Minnesota to Louisiana, and it does not border any Canadian provinces as it is entirely within the United States.\n\nHowever, if you're thinking of a river that borders both the United States and Canada, the Missouri River is another major tributary of the Mississippi River system, but it also doesn't border Canada. Another significant river is the Colorado River, which flows through seven U.S. states and two Mexican states, but again, not Canadian provinces.\n\nPerhaps you're thinking of the Columbia River, which flows through British Columbia in Canada and the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon. The Columbia River is one of the largest rivers in North America and is known for its hydroelectric power production and salmon runs.\n\nAlternatively, the St. Lawrence River forms part of the international boundary between the United States and Canada, flowing between Lake Ontario and the Atlantic Ocean, and it borders several U.S. states and Canadian provinces.\n\nCould you please provide more specifics or confirm if one of these rivers matches what you're thinking of?\n"
