        "content": "The word \"daisy\" has an interesting etymology. It comes from the Old English term \"d\u00e6ges eage,\" which literally translates to \"day's eye.\" This name was given because the flower's petals open up in the daytime, resembling the sun, and close at night. Over time, \"d\u00e6ges eage\" evolved into \"daisy\" in Middle English. So, the name reflects the flower's behavior of opening and closing with the daylight."
