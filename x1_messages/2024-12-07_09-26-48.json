        "content": "So, the book has 200 pages, and I read 25 pages per day. I need to find out how many days it will take to finish the book. Hmm, this seems like a division problem. I think I should divide the total number of pages by the number of pages I read each day. So, 200 divided by 25.\n\nLet me do that. 200 divided by 25 is... well, 25 times 8 is 200, so it should be 8 days. But let me make sure. If I read 25 pages a day for 8 days, that's 25 times 8, which is 200 pages. Perfect, that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, but what if I don't read every day? What if I take breaks or something? The question says \"per day,\" so I guess it's assuming I read every day without breaks. So, it should be 8 days if I read 25 pages each day without any breaks.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can think about it in weeks. If I read every day, and there are 7 days in a week, then 25 pages a day for a week would be 175 pages, since 25 times 7 is 175. Then, I'd have 25 pages left, which would take one more day. So, that's 7 days plus 1 day, which is 8 days again. Okay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about how many pages I read per week and see how many weeks it would take. But since the question is in days, it's probably simpler to stick with days.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. Is there any chance that the book has some pages that aren't read, like copyright pages or something? The question says the book has 200 pages, so I think it's safe to assume all pages are read.\n\nAlso, is there a possibility that the number of pages I read per day changes? The question says I read 25 pages per day, so I'll assume that's constant.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take 8 days to finish the book if I read 25 pages each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
