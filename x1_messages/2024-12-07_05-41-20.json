        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The student needs an average of at least 85% across four exams to pass the course. They've already taken three exams with scores of 90%, 82%, and 78%. We need to find out what they must score on the fourth exam to achieve that average.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an average is. The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by how many there are. So, for four exams, the average would be the sum of all four scores divided by four.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let's denote the score on the fourth exam as \\( x \\). The average of the four exams would then be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average} = \\frac{90 + 82 + 78 + x}{4}\n\\]\n\nWe know that this average needs to be at least 85%. So, we can set up the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{90 + 82 + 78 + x}{4} \\geq 85\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( x \\) to find the minimum score required on the fourth exam.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the sum in the numerator:\n\n\\[\n90 + 82 + 78 = 250\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{250 + x}{4} \\geq 85\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the denominator, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by 4:\n\n\\[\n250 + x \\geq 340\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract 250 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx \\geq 340 - 250\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx \\geq 90\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the student needs to score at least 90% on the fourth exam to achieve an average of 85% or higher for the course.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total percentage points needed for all four exams to achieve an average of 85%. Since the average is the total sum divided by the number of exams, we can find the total sum required by multiplying the desired average by the number of exams:\n\n\\[\n\\text{total required} = 85 \\times 4 = 340\n\\]\n\nThe student has already scored 90 + 82 + 78 = 250 on the first three exams. So, the score needed on the fourth exam is:\n\n\\[\nx = 340 - 250 = 90\n\\]\n\nThis matches the previous result. So, the student needs to score at least 90% on the fourth exam.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, is there a maximum score that can be achieved on the fourth exam? Typically, exam scores are capped at 100%, so the student cannot score more than 100%. But in this case, since 90% is less than 100%, it's achievable.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the student needs at least 90%, meaning 90% or higher. Scoring exactly 90% would give an average of 85%, and anything above 90% would raise the average above 85%.\n\nLet me quickly check what the average would be if the student scores exactly 90% on the fourth exam:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average} = \\frac{90 + 82 + 78 + 90}{4} = \\frac{340}{4} = 85\\%\n\\]\n\nPerfect, that matches our requirement.\n\nAlternatively, if the student scores higher than 90%, say 95%:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average} = \\frac{90 + 82 + 78 + 95}{4} = \\frac{345}{4} = 86.25\\%\n\\]\n\nWhich is above the required average.\n\nConversely, if the student scores less than 90%, say 85%:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average} = \\frac{90 + 82 + 78 + 85}{4} = \\frac{335}{4} = 83.75\\%\n\\]\n\nWhich is below the required 85%.\n\nTherefore, the minimum score needed on the fourth exam is indeed 90%.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if the student scores exactly 90%, they will pass with the minimum required average. Scoring higher than 90% will not only ensure passing but also result in a higher average.\n\nIn conclusion, the student must score at least 90% on the fourth exam to achieve an average of 85% or higher for the course.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90\\%} \\]"
