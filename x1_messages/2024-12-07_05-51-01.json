They leaped, twirling in mid-air, silver flanks glinting like moonlight on water. Their clicks and whistles echoed, a language unknown to humans. Suddenly, a net loomed, its tendrils reaching out. Panic surged. With a final burst of speed, they slipped through the mesh, hearts pounding. Freedom was sweet, but caution now ruled their every move."
