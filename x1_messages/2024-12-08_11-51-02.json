        "content": "Let's see... So there's this puzzle about a man building a house with four sides, each facing south, and a bear walks past it, and the question is what color is the bear. Hmm, that's interesting. I've heard similar puzzles before, but usually, they involve directions and geography in a tricky way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The house has four sides, and each side faces south. That seems impossible because in regular directions, if one side faces south, the opposite side should face north, and the other two sides would face east and west. But here, all four sides face south. So, there must be something unique about the location of this house.\n\nMaybe the house is built at the North Pole. If you're at the North Pole, every direction is south. So, all four sides of the house would indeed face south. That makes sense. And if the house is at the North Pole, and a bear walks past it, what color is the bear?\n\nBears at the North Pole are polar bears, and polar bears are white. So, the bear is white.\n\nWait a minute, but is that the only possible answer? Is it possible for the house to be built somewhere else where all four sides face south?\n\nLet me think. If the house is built right at the North Pole, then yes, all four sides would face south. But are there any other places on Earth where this could happen?\n\nHmm, maybe near the South Pole. But if you're at the South Pole, every direction is north, so that wouldn't work for this puzzle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps on a curved surface or something like that. But I think the North Pole is the only place where all directions are south.\n\nSo, if the house is at the North Pole, and the bear is a polar bear, then the bear is white.\n\nBut, I recall that there are other types of bears that could be white, or at least have white fur sometimes, but polar bears are the only bears that are naturally white.\n\nWait, but some brown bears can have white coats due to albinism, but that's rare, and the default assumption should be polar bear.\n\nAlso, the puzzle mentions that a bear walks past the house. Polar bears are the only bears that inhabit the Arctic region, which includes the North Pole.\n\nTherefore, the bear is white.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other scenarios where all four sides of a house face south.\n\nMaybe if the house is built on the side of a hill or something, but I don't think that would change the direction that the sides face.\n\nAlternatively, if the house is built on a spherical object or something, but again, I think the North Pole is the only practical solution.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the bear is white.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{white}} \\]"
