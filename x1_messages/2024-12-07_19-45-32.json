First, we need to understand the current situation and then see how it changes after hiring additional full-time employees.\n\n1. **Current workforce:**\n   - Total employees: 200\n   - Percentage of part-time workers: 40%\n\n   From this, we can calculate the number of part-time workers and full-time workers currently.\n\n   Number of part-time workers = 40% of 200\n   = 0.40 \u00d7 200\n   = 80\n\n   Therefore, the number of full-time workers is:\n   Total employees - part-time workers\n   = 200 - 80\n   = 120\n\n2. **Hiring additional full-time employees:**\n   - Additional full-time employees: 50\n\n   After hiring, the new number of full-time employees will be:\n   Current full-time employees + additional full-time employees\n   = 120 + 50\n   = 170\n\n   The total number of employees after hiring will be:\n   Current total employees + additional employees\n   = 200 + 50\n   = 250\n\n3. **Calculating the new percentage of part-time workers:**\n   The number of part-time workers remains the same (80), but the total number of employees is now 250.\n\n   Percentage of part-time workers = (Number of part-time workers / Total employees) \u00d7 100\n   = (80 / 250) \u00d7 100\n   = 0.32 \u00d7 100\n   = 32%\n\nSo, after hiring an additional 50 full-time employees, the percentage of part-time workers in the workforce will be 32%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32\\%} \\]"
