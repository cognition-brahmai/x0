        "content": "So the factory produces 2000 units of product A and 3000 units of product B each day. Product A sells for $15 per unit and product B sells for $10 per unit. To find the daily revenue, I need to calculate the total sales from both products.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the revenue from product A. That's 2000 units times $15 per unit. So, 2000 multiplied by 15.\n\n2000 \u00d7 15 = 30,000\n\nSo, product A brings in $30,000 per day.\n\nNext, for product B, it's 3000 units at $10 each.\n\n3000 \u00d7 10 = 30,000\n\nSo, product B also brings in $30,000 per day.\n\nNow, to find the total daily revenue, I'll add the revenues from both products together.\n\n30,000 (from A) + 30,000 (from B) = 60,000\n\nTherefore, the factory generates $60,000 in revenue each day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a faster way to do this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as total revenue equals the sum of (quantity of A times price of A) and (quantity of B times price of B).\n\nSo, Revenue = (2000 \u00d7 15) + (3000 \u00d7 10)\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, leading to $60,000.\n\nOr, another way: since both products contribute $30,000 each, total is $60,000.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other costs or factors that might affect the revenue. The question asks for revenue, not profit, so costs like production costs aren't relevant here. Revenue is just the income from sales.\n\nAlso, the question specifies \"daily revenue,\" and it gives daily production amounts, so that seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I should consider if all produced units are sold. The question says \"each unit of product A sells for $15\" and \"each unit of product B sells for $10,\" but it doesn't explicitly say that all units are sold. Maybe some units are not sold.\n\nBut in standard economics, revenue is calculated based on units sold, not produced. So, if not all units are sold, revenue would only be from the sold units.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify any unsold units, perhaps it's safe to assume that all produced units are sold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a inventory element, but that might be too complicated for this level.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the assumption that all units produced are sold.\n\nTherefore, revenue is indeed (2000 \u00d7 15) + (3000 \u00d7 10) = $60,000.\n\nAnother angle: maybe there are different selling prices based on demand, but the question gives fixed prices, so no need to consider that.\n\nOr perhaps there are discounts or variations in price, but again, the question states fixed prices per unit.\n\nSo, unless there's additional information, $60,000 is the daily revenue.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to verify this calculation.\n\nLet me do the math again:\n\n2000 units of A at $15 each: 2000 \u00d7 15 = 30,000\n\n3000 units of B at $10 each: 3000 \u00d7 10 = 30,000\n\nTotal: 30,000 + 30,000 = 60,000\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the average price per unit:\n\nTotal units: 2000 + 3000 = 5000\n\nTotal revenue: 60,000\n\nAverage price per unit: 60,000 / 5000 = 12\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nWell, product A is $15 and product B is $10. The average being $12 seems plausible, given the quantities.\n\nBecause product B has more units, it pulls the average down.\n\nTo verify:\n\nWeighted average price: (2000/5000)\u00d715 + (3000/5000)\u00d710\n\nWhich is (0.4 \u00d7 15) + (0.6 \u00d7 10) = 6 + 6 = 12\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, total revenue would be average price times total units: 12 \u00d7 5000 = 60,000\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, perhaps I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect revenue, like taxes or fees.\n\nBut typically, revenue is calculated before deductions, so $60,000 would be the gross revenue.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, $60,000 is the daily revenue generated by the factory.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 60000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60000} \\]"
