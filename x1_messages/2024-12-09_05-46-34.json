To create a Java program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of words in each line, and then prints the total word count at the end, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Reading the File:** We need to read the content of a text file line by line.\n2. **Counting Words:** For each line, we need to count the number of words.\n3. **Summing Up:** Keep a running total of the word counts from all lines.\n4. **Printing the Total:** Finally, print the total word count.\n\nWe'll use Java's built-in libraries to handle file reading and string operations. Specifically, we'll use `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line and `String.split` to split each line into words based on spaces.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implement this:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Project\n\nCreate a new Java project in your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) or set up a simple Java file in your text editor.\n\n### Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nWe need to import `java.io.*` for file handling and `java.util.*` for any utility classes we might need.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Main Class and Method\n\nWe'll create a public class, say `WordCounter`, with a `main` method.\n\n### Step 4: Handle File Reading\n\nInside the `main` method, we'll handle file reading using a `BufferedReader`. We need to specify the file path of the text file we want to read.\n\n### Step 5: Count Words in Each Line\n\nFor each line read from the file, we'll split the line into words using spaces as delimiters and count the number of elements in the resulting array.\n\n### Step 6: Sum Up the Word Counts\n\nMaintain a variable to keep track of the total word count and add the word count of each line to this variable.\n\n### Step 7: Print the Total Word Count\n\nAfter processing all lines, print the total word count.\n\n### Complete Code Example\n\nHere's how the complete code might look:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class WordCounter {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Specify the path to your text file\n        String filePath = \"path/to/your/textfile.txt\";\n        int totalWordCount = 0;\n\n        // Try-with-resources to ensure the reader is closed after use\n        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n            String line;\n            // Read each line from the file\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                // Split the line into words based on spaces\n                String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n                // Add the number of words in this line to the total count\n                totalWordCount += words.length;\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        // Print the total word count\n        System.out.println(\"Total word count: \" + totalWordCount);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **File Path:** Replace `\"path/to/your/textfile.txt\"` with the actual path to your text file.\n2. **BufferedReader:** This is used for efficient reading of the file line by line.\n3. **String.split(\"\\\\s+\"):** This splits the line into words based on one or more whitespace characters.\n4. **try-with-resources:** Ensures that the `BufferedReader` is closed automatically after reading, even if an exception occurs.\n5. **Exception Handling:** Catches `IOException` in case there are issues reading the file.\n\nThis program will read the specified text file, count the words in each line, sum them up, and print the total word count at the end.\n\n**Note:** Make sure the file path is correct and the file is accessible. If the file is in the same directory as your Java file, you can use just the file name."
