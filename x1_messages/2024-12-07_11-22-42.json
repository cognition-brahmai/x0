        "content": "Both President Andrew Jackson and his Vice President John C. Calhoun served in the War of 1812 prior to their terms in office.\n\nAndrew Jackson is perhaps best known for his role in the War of 1812, particularly for his victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, which occurred after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed but before news of peace had reached the Americas. This battle cemented Jackson's reputation as a military hero and later contributed significantly to his presidential campaign.\n\nJohn C. Calhoun also played a notable role in the War of 1812. He served as the Secretary of War under President James Madison during the conflict. Calhoun was instrumental in organizing the nation's war efforts and was later recognized for his contributions.\n\nTheir experiences in the War of 1812 shaped their political careers and influenced their policies once they assumed higher offices in the U.S. government."
