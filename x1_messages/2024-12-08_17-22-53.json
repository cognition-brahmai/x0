Finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings is a classic problem in computer science, and dynamic programming is a great way to solve it efficiently. I'll walk you through the process and provide you with a Python script that does exactly that.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguously. For example, in the string \"abcde\", \"ace\" is a subsequence, but \"aec\" is not.\n\nThe longest common subsequence between two strings is the longest sequence that is a subsequence of both strings. For instance, given the strings \"ABCBDAB\" and \"BDCAB\", the LCS is \"BCAB\".\n\nNow, to solve this using dynamic programming, we'll create a 2D table where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the length of the LCS of the first i characters of the first string and the first j characters of the second string.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization:** Create a 2D array (table) with dimensions (len(str1) + 1) x (len(str2) + 1). Initialize the first row and the first column to 0 because the LCS of an empty string with any string is 0.\n\n2. **Filling the table:** For each character in str1 and str2:\n   - If the characters match (str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]), then the value in the table at [i][j] is the value at [i-1][j-1] plus 1.\n   - If the characters don't match, then the value in the table at [i][j] is the maximum of the value at [i-1][j] and [i][j-1].\n\n3. **Backtracking:** Once the table is filled, the length of the LCS is in table[len(str1)][len(str2)]. To find the actual LCS, we can backtrack from this cell to reconstruct the sequence.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lcs(str1, str2):\n    m = len(str1)\n    n = len(str2)\n\n    # Create a table to store lengths of longest common subsequence.\n    table = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # Fill table in bottom-up fashion\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                table[i][j] = table[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                table[i][j] = max(table[i - 1][j], table[i][j - 1])\n\n    # Following the table to collect the longest common subsequence\n    index = table[m][n]\n    lcs = [\"\"] * (index + 1)\n    lcs[index] = \"\"\n\n    # Start from the bottom right corner and\n    # store characters in lcs[]\n    i = m\n    j = n\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n            lcs[index - 1] = str1[i - 1]\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n            index -= 1\n        elif table[i - 1][j] > table[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n\n    return \"\".join(lcs)\n\n# Example usage:\nstr1 = \"ABCBDAB\"\nstr2 = \"BDCAB\"\nprint(\"Longest Common Subsequence:\", lcs(str1, str2))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Table Construction:** We build a table where each cell [i][j] contains the length of the LCS of the first i characters of str1 and the first j characters of str2.\n2. **Filling the Table:** We iterate through each character of both strings. If characters match, we add 1 to the diagonal value; otherwise, we take the maximum value from the left or top cell.\n3. **Backtracking:** We start from the bottom-right corner of the table and trace back to construct the LCS by checking if characters match or by moving to the cell with the higher value.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the LCS efficiently with a time complexity of O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings."
