        "content": "I think there might be some confusion here. From what I know, the Titanic was a British passenger ship, not Italian, and it sank in the North Atlantic Ocean, not the Mediterranean Sea. Also, the date you mentioned is November 21, 1905, but I believe the Titanic sank in April 1912. And, tragically, a lot of people didn't survive; it was a major disaster. Maybe there's some mix-up with another ship?\n\nLet me check some facts. The Titanic was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Ireland, for the White Star Line. It was known for being one of the largest and most luxurious ships at the time. Its maiden voyage was from Southampton, England, to New York City, with stops in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland.\n\nOn April 14, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the Titanic hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean and sank in the early hours of April 15. The disaster resulted in the loss of more than 1,500 lives, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.\n\nSo, to answer your question correctly: The Titanic, on her maiden voyage, struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean and sank on April 15, 1912, resulting in a significant loss of life.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Nationality:** British\n\n- **Type:** Passenger ship\n\n- **Location of sinking:** North Atlantic Ocean\n\n- **Date:** April 15, 1912\n\n- **Cause:** Hit an iceberg\n\n- **Passengers and crew:** Estimated 2,224\n\n- **Deaths:** Over 1,500\n\n- **Survivors:** Approximately 706\n\nI hope that clears things up. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!"
