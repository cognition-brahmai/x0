        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a baker uses 15 eggs to make 60 cupcakes, and I need to figure out how many eggs he would use to make 150 cupcakes. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cupcakes. It seems like there's a proportional relationship here\u2014more eggs mean more cupcakes. So, if 15 eggs make 60 cupcakes, I need to find out how many eggs (let's call it x) would make 150 cupcakes.\n\nOne way to approach this is to set up a proportion. Proportions are good for solving problems where two ratios are equal. So, the ratio of eggs to cupcakes should be the same in both cases.\n\nThe ratio is eggs over cupcakes, so:\n\n15 eggs / 60 cupcakes = x eggs / 150 cupcakes\n\nNow, I can cross-multiply to solve for x.\n\n15 * 150 = 60 * x\n\nThat gives:\n\n2250 = 60x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 60 to solve for x:\n\nx = 2250 / 60\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n2250 divided by 60 is 37.5\n\nSo, x = 37.5\n\nWait, but eggs are whole items, isn't it? Can you use half an egg in baking? Maybe in some recipes, but generally, it's whole eggs. Maybe I should consider if there's a need to round up or consider the practical aspect.\n\nBut according to the math, it's 37.5 eggs. Maybe the baker can use half an egg, or perhaps the recipe can be adjusted to use whole eggs. But based on the proportion, it's 37.5.\n\nLet me check another way to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how many eggs are used per cupcake.\n\nIf 15 eggs make 60 cupcakes, then eggs per cupcake is 15/60 = 0.25 eggs per cupcake.\n\nNow, for 150 cupcakes, it would be 150 * 0.25 = 37.5 eggs.\n\nSame result. So, that reinforces that the answer is indeed 37.5 eggs.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of scaling.\n\nIf 60 cupcakes require 15 eggs, then to find out how many times 60 goes into 150, I can divide 150 by 60.\n\n150 / 60 = 2.5\n\nSo, it's 2.5 times the original amount.\n\nTherefore, the eggs needed would be 15 * 2.5 = 37.5\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think no matter which way I approach it, I end up with 37.5 eggs.\n\nMaybe another way: using the unitary method.\n\nFirst, find out how many eggs are needed for one cupcake.\n\nEggs per cupcake = 15 eggs / 60 cupcakes = 0.25 eggs per cupcake\n\nThen, for 150 cupcakes: 150 * 0.25 = 37.5 eggs\n\nStill the same.\n\nAlright, I think it's consistent across different methods. So, the baker would need 37.5 eggs to make 150 cupcakes.\n\nBut, considering that eggs are whole items, perhaps the baker would need to use 38 eggs, rounding up, to have enough.\n\nOr maybe, if the recipe can be adjusted to use half an egg, then 37.5 is fine.\n\nBut based on the problem, it's asking for how many eggs would be used, and mathematically, it's 37.5.\n\nI think the answer is 37.5 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37.5} \\]"
