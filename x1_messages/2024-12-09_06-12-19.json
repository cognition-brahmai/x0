        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a square with an area of 64 square units, and it's being cut into four equal smaller squares. I need to find the perimeter of one of those smaller squares.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the side length of the original square. Since the area of a square is given by side length squared, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{side length}^2 = 64 \\]\n\nTo find the side length, I take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\text{side length} = \\sqrt{64} = 8 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNow, the square is being cut into four equal smaller squares. I need to visualize how this is done. If I imagine the original square and cut it in half both horizontally and vertically, I'll end up with four smaller squares, each taking up one quadrant of the original square.\n\nEach smaller square will have a side length that is half of the original square's side length because we're dividing both the length and the width by two.\n\nSo, the side length of each smaller square is:\n\n\\[ \\text{smaller side length} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of one of these smaller squares, I use the formula for the perimeter of a square, which is four times the side length:\n\n\\[ \\text{perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{side length} = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check if the smaller squares are indeed formed by halving both dimensions. If I have a square of side 8, cutting it in half horizontally and vertically should give me four squares, each with sides of 4 units. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the area of each smaller square. The original area is 64 square units, and it's being divided into four equal parts, so each smaller square has an area of:\n\n\\[ \\text{smaller area} = \\frac{64}{4} = 16 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\nThen, the side length of each smaller square would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{smaller side length} = \\sqrt{16} = 4 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nAgain, the perimeter would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{perimeter} = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this. Suppose the square isn't cut into four equal smaller squares by halving both dimensions. Is there another way to cut a square into four equal smaller squares?\n\nHmm, I think the only way to cut a square into four equal smaller squares is by making two cuts: one horizontal and one vertical, both through the midpoints. This would divide the square into four smaller squares, each with side lengths half of the original.\n\nIf there's another method, I can't think of it right now, so I'll stick with this approach.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that in the original square, the area is 64, and when divided into four equal smaller squares, each smaller square has an area of 16. The perimeter of a square is proportional to its side length, which in turn is determined by the square root of its area.\n\nSo, perimeter is indeed 16 units.\n\nWait, but let me consider if the cuts are not made through the midpoints. For example, what if the cuts are made off-center? Could that result in four smaller squares of equal area?\n\nI don't think so. If the cuts aren't through the midpoints, the resulting shapes wouldn't all be squares. Some would be rectangles or other quadrilaterals. So, to have four equal smaller squares, the cuts must be through the midpoints.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach is correct, and the perimeter of one of the smaller squares is 16 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
