        "content": "Let's see. The company produces 500 units every week, and each unit costs $20 to make. They sell each unit for $35. I need to find out what their weekly profit is.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total cost of producing those 500 units. Since each unit costs $20, I can multiply the number of units by the cost per unit to get the total cost.\n\nTotal cost = number of units \u00d7 cost per unit\nTotal cost = 500 \u00d7 $20\nTotal cost = $10,000\n\nNext, I need to find out how much revenue the company brings in from selling those 500 units. Each unit is sold for $35, so again, I'll multiply the number of units by the selling price per unit to get the total revenue.\n\nTotal revenue = number of units \u00d7 selling price per unit\nTotal revenue = 500 \u00d7 $35\nTotal revenue = $17,500\n\nNow, profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n\nProfit = total revenue - total cost\nProfit = $17,500 - $10,000\nProfit = $7,500\n\nSo, the company makes a weekly profit of $7,500.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Are there any other costs involved, like overheads or taxes? The question only mentions the production cost per unit and the selling price, so I think $7,500 is the correct weekly profit.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the calculations again.\n\nTotal cost: 500 units \u00d7 $20 = $10,000\nTotal revenue: 500 units \u00d7 $35 = $17,500\nProfit: $17,500 - $10,000 = $7,500\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7500} \\]"
