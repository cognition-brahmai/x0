        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces 500 units of a product every day. Out of these, 0.5% are defective. We need to find out how many non-defective products are produced over 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 0.5% defective means. If 0.5% of the products are defective, then the remaining percentage must be non-defective. So, 100% - 0.5% = 99.5% are non-defective.\n\nNow, the factory produces 500 units per day. To find out how many of these are non-defective each day, I can calculate 99.5% of 500.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n99.5% of 500 = (99.5 / 100) * 500 = 0.995 * 500 = 497.5\n\nWait, that can't be right. You can't have half a product, can you? Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of defective products first and then subtract that from the total daily production to get the non-defective count.\n\nSo, defective rate is 0.5% of 500.\n\n0.5% of 500 = (0.5 / 100) * 500 = 0.005 * 500 = 2.5\n\nAgain, half a product doesn't make sense. Maybe the defective rate is meant to be a whole number. Perhaps it's an average?\n\nAssuming that, on average, 0.5% of products are defective, which leads to 2.5 defective products per day, but since we can't have half products, perhaps in reality, some days have 2 defective products and some have 3.\n\nBut for calculation purposes, I'll proceed with the average.\n\nSo, daily non-defective production = total daily production - defective products = 500 - 2.5 = 497.5\n\nNow, over 30 days, the total non-defective production would be 497.5 units/day * 30 days.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n497.5 * 30 = 14,925\n\nSo, over 30 days, the factory produces 14,925 non-defective products.\n\nBut, considering that you can't have half a product, maybe I should round the daily non-defective production to the nearest whole number.\n\n497.5 rounds to 498 units per day.\n\nThen, 498 * 30 = 14,940\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that defective products are 2.5 per day, over 30 days that's 2.5 * 30 = 75 defective products.\n\nTotal production over 30 days is 500 * 30 = 15,000 units.\n\nSubtracting defective products: 15,000 - 75 = 14,925 non-defective products.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 14,925 non-defective products produced in 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14925} \\]"
