        "content": "Let's see here. The store sells apples for $1.50 per pound and oranges for $2.00 per pound. The customer buys 4 pounds of apples and 3 pounds of oranges, and pays with a $20 bill. I need to find out how much change they'll get back.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total cost of the apples. Apples are $1.50 per pound, and the customer buys 4 pounds. So, 1.50 times 4 should give me the total cost for apples.\n\n1.50 \u00d7 4 = 6.00\n\nSo, the apples cost $6.00.\n\nNext, the oranges are $2.00 per pound, and the customer buys 3 pounds. So, 2.00 times 3 will give me the total cost for oranges.\n\n2.00 \u00d7 3 = 6.00\n\nOranges also cost $6.00.\n\nNow, I need to find the total cost of both the apples and oranges together.\n\n6.00 + 6.00 = 12.00\n\nSo, the total cost is $12.00.\n\nThe customer pays with a $20 bill. To find out the change, I need to subtract the total cost from $20.\n\n20.00 - 12.00 = 8.00\n\nTherefore, the customer should receive $8.00 in change.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Apples are $1.50 per pound, 4 pounds is $6.00. Oranges are $2.00 per pound, 3 pounds is $6.00. Total is $12.00. $20 minus $12 is indeed $8.00.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
