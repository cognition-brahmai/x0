List all employees who earn more than $50,000.**\n\nTo list all employees earning more than $50,000, we need to select records from the employees table where the salary is greater than 50000. Assuming the employees table has columns like employee_id, name, salary, etc., the query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM employees\nWHERE salary > 50000;\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns from the employees table where the salary is greater than 50000.\n\n**b. Find the department that has the most employees.**\n\nTo find the department with the most employees, we need to count the number of employees in each department and then identify the one with the highest count. Assuming there is a departments table and a relationship between employees and departments (perhaps through a department_id column in the employees table), the query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS employee_count\nFROM departments d\nJOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id\nGROUP BY d.department_name\nORDER BY employee_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query joins the departments and employees tables on department_id, groups the results by department_name, counts the number of employees in each department, orders the results in descending order by employee_count, and limits the output to the top department with the most employees.\n\n**c. Increase the salary of all employees in the 'Sales' department by 10%.**\n\nTo increase the salary of all employees in the 'Sales' department by 10%, we need to update the salary column in the employees table for those specific employees. Assuming the departments table has a department_name column, and employees table has a department_id that relates to departments table, the query would be:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE employees\nSET salary = salary * 1.10\nWHERE department_id = (\n    SELECT department_id\n    FROM departments\n    WHERE department_name = 'Sales'\n);\n```\n\nThis query updates the salary of employees in the Sales department by increasing it by 10%. It first selects the department_id for the 'Sales' department from the departments table and then uses that id to update the salary in the employees table.\n\nMake sure to backup your data before running update queries to avoid accidental data loss.\n\nI hope these queries help you manage your company database effectively! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
