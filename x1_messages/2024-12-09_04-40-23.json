        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have an office with 25 employees, and each employee uses an average of 80 sheets of paper every week. We need to find out how many sheets of paper the office uses in a year, considering there are 52 weeks in a year.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total number of sheets used by all employees in one week. Since each employee uses 80 sheets per week, and there are 25 employees, I'll multiply 80 by 25.\n\n80 sheets/employee/week * 25 employees = 2,000 sheets/week\n\nSo, the office uses 2,000 sheets of paper each week.\n\nNext, to find out the annual usage, I need to multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52.\n\n2,000 sheets/week * 52 weeks/year = 104,000 sheets/year\n\nTherefore, the office uses 104,000 sheets of paper in a year.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the annual usage per employee first and then multiply by the number of employees.\n\nEach employee uses 80 sheets per week, so in a year, one employee would use:\n\n80 sheets/week * 52 weeks/year = 4,160 sheets/year\n\nThen, for 25 employees:\n\n4,160 sheets/year/employee * 25 employees = 104,000 sheets/year\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, 104,000 sheets per year seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, perhaps I should consider if there are any exceptions or additional factors that might affect this calculation. For example, are there any holidays or weeks where employees might not be using paper? But the problem states \"52 weeks,\" so I'll assume it accounts for the entire year, including holidays.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"average\" usage, which suggests that the weekly usage might fluctuate, but since it's an average, using 80 sheets per week per employee is sufficient for this calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any paper-saving initiatives in the office that might reduce paper usage, but again, the problem doesn't mention any such factors, so I'll stick with the given data.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the office uses 104,000 sheets of paper in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{104000} \\]"
