        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There are 50 people in a room: 20 men and 30 women. I need to find the probability that if I randomly select two people from the room, both of them are women.\n\nOkay, probability problems can sometimes be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. I know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to select any two people from the room. And the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to select two women from the room.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to select two people from 50. That sounds like a combination problem because the order doesn't matter; I just need to choose two people without regard to order.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose two people from 50 is:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50!}{2!(50 - 2)!} = \\frac{50!}{2! \\cdot 48!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 48! in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 48!} = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{2450}{2} = 1225\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 1225 possible ways to choose any two people from the room.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to choose two women from the 30 women present. Again, this is a combination problem.\n\n\\[\nC(30, 2) = \\frac{30!}{2!(30 - 2)!} = \\frac{30!}{2! \\cdot 28!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying similarly:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 2) = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 28!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{870}{2} = 435\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 435 ways to choose two women from the room.\n\nNow, the probability that both selected people are women is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both women}) = \\frac{435}{1225}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{435 \\div 5}{1225 \\div 5} = \\frac{87}{245}\n\\]\n\nI'll check if this can be simplified further. Let's see if 87 and 245 have any common factors.\n\n87 divided by 3 is 29, and 245 divided by 5 is 49. 29 and 49 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both selected people are women is \\( \\frac{87}{245} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal or a percentage for better understanding. Let's calculate it as a decimal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{87}{245} \\approx 0.3551\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.3551, or 35.51%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities sequentially?\n\nLet's think about it. The probability that the first person selected is a woman is the number of women divided by the total number of people:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first woman}) = \\frac{30}{50} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that the first person selected is a woman, there are now 29 women left and 49 people left in the room. So, the probability that the second person selected is also a woman is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{second woman} | \\text{first woman}) = \\frac{29}{49}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that both are women is the product of these two probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both women}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{29}{49} = \\frac{87}{245}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier using combinations.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is \\( \\frac{87}{245} \\), or approximately 35.51%.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem to ensure I'm not missing anything?\n\nPerhaps I can consider the probability of selecting two men and see if that makes sense.\n\nThe number of ways to select two men from 20 is:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20 - 2)!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2 \\times 1} = 190\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of selecting two men is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both men}) = \\frac{190}{1225} = \\frac{38}{245} \\approx 0.1551\n\\]\n\nAnd the probability of selecting one man and one woman can be calculated as:\n\nFirst, select a man and then a woman, or select a woman and then a man.\n\nThe number of ways to select a man first and then a woman is:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 30 = 600\n\\]\n\nThe number of ways to select a woman first and then a man is:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 20 = 600\n\\]\n\nSo, total number of ways to select one man and one woman is 600 + 600 = 1200.\n\nBut wait, this is ordered selection, whereas our earlier combinations were unordered.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nIf I'm selecting two people without regard to order, then the number of ways to select one man and one woman should be:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 1) \\times C(30, 1) = 20 \\times 30 = 600\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of selecting one man and one woman is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one man and one woman}) = \\frac{600}{1225} = \\frac{120}{245} \\approx 0.4898\n\\]\n\nNow, if I add up all the probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both women}) + P(\\text{both men}) + P(\\text{one man and one woman}) = \\frac{87}{245} + \\frac{38}{245} + \\frac{120}{245} = \\frac{245}{245} = 1\n\\]\n\nWhich makes sense because these are the only possible outcomes when selecting two people from the room.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for probability of independent events, but in this case, the selections are without replacement, so they are dependent events.\n\nWait, actually, in the sequential approach, the probability changes after the first selection, which is why it's dependent.\n\nBut in the combinations approach, we consider the selection without regard to order, which accounts for the dependency.\n\nEither way, both methods lead to the same result.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The answer should be \\( \\frac{87}{245} \\), or approximately 35.51%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{87}{245}} \\]"
