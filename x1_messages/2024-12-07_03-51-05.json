        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. A company spends 30% of its revenue on salaries, and the total annual salary expense is $450,000. I need to find out what the company's annual revenue is. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that 30% of the revenue is spent on salaries. That means if I can find out what 30% of the revenue is, it should equal $450,000. So, in mathematical terms, 30% of revenue (R) equals $450,000. I can write that as:\n\n0.30 * R = $450,000\n\nNow, I need to solve for R, which is the revenue. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.30. So:\n\nR = $450,000 / 0.30\n\nLet me do that calculation. $450,000 divided by 0.30.\n\nFirst, 0.30 times what number equals $450,000? Well, 0.30 is the same as 30/100 or 3/10. So, 3/10 of R is $450,000. To find R, I can multiply $450,000 by 10/3.\n\nSo, $450,000 * (10/3) = ?\n\nLet's see, 450,000 divided by 3 is 150,000, and then multiplied by 10 is 1,500,000.\n\nAlternatively, $450,000 / 0.30 is the same as $450,000 * (1/0.30), which is $450,000 * (10/3) = $1,500,000.\n\nSo, the company's annual revenue is $1,500,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the revenue is $1,500,000 and they spend 30% on salaries, then 30% of $1,500,000 should be $450,000.\n\nLet me calculate 30% of $1,500,000.\n\n30/100 * 1,500,000 = 0.30 * 1,500,000 = $450,000.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the company's annual revenue is indeed $1,500,000.\n\nI think that makes sense. I used the basic formula for percentage calculations to find the total revenue based on the percentage spent on salaries and the actual amount spent.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions or some other method?\n\nWell, another approach could be to set up a proportion. If 30% corresponds to $450,000, then 100% would correspond to the total revenue.\n\nSo, I can write it as:\n\n30% : $450,000 = 100% : R\n\nThen, to find R, I can cross-multiply and solve for R.\n\nSo, 30% * R = 100% * $450,000\n\nThen, R = (100% * $450,000) / 30%\n\nSince percent means per hundred, 100% is 1, and 30% is 0.30.\n\nSo, R = ($450,000) / 0.30 = $1,500,000\n\nAgain, I get the same answer. So, no matter which method I use, the result is $1,500,000.\n\nMaybe I can try using algebra to solve it.\n\nLet R be the revenue.\n\nGiven that 30% of R is $450,000.\n\nSo, 0.30R = 450,000\n\nTo find R, divide both sides by 0.30.\n\nR = 450,000 / 0.30 = 1,500,000\n\nOnce again, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The company's annual revenue is $1,500,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this calculation. For example, are there any taxes or other expenses that might be included in the revenue? But based on the information given, the problem seems straightforward. It states that 30% of revenue is spent on salaries, and the salary expense is $450,000, so finding the total revenue is simply a matter of calculating the whole from the given percentage.\n\nI don't think there are any tricks or additional steps needed here. The problem is clear, and the calculation is straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is $1,500,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1500000} \\]"
