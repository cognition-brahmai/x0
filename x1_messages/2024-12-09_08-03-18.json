        "content": "Given the set \\( s = \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\), I need to find all possible subsets of \\( s \\). A subset is a set that contains elements from \\( s \\), and it can be any combination of these elements, including the empty set and \\( s \\) itself.\n\nTo find all possible subsets, I can consider each element and decide whether to include it or not in a particular subset. Since there are 3 elements, there are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) possible subsets. Let's list them step by step.\n\n1. The empty set: \\( \\{\\} \\)\n2. Subsets with one element:\n   - \\( \\{1\\} \\)\n   - \\( \\{2\\} \\)\n   - \\( \\{3\\} \\)\n3. Subsets with two elements:\n   - \\( \\{1, 2\\} \\)\n   - \\( \\{1, 3\\} \\)\n   - \\( \\{2, 3\\} \\)\n4. The subset with all three elements:\n   - \\( \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\)\n\nSo, the complete list of subsets is:\n\n\\[ \\{\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\]\n\nTo verify, I can check that there are indeed 8 subsets, which matches the calculation \\( 2^3 = 8 \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of the power set. The power set of a set \\( s \\) is the set of all subsets of \\( s \\), and its cardinality is \\( 2^{|s|} \\), where \\( |s| \\) is the number of elements in \\( s \\). Here, \\( |s| = 3 \\), so the power set has 8 elements, which matches what I found.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAll possible subsets of \\( s = \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\) are \\( \\{\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\boxed{ \\{\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2,3\\} }\\)"
