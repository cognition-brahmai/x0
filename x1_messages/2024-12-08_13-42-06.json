        "content": "Okay, I'm going to try to write a Java program that simulates a simple banking system. I need to create classes for Bank, Account, and Customer. The bank should be able to create new accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and display account balances.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what each class should do and what properties they should have.\n\nStarting with the Customer class, each customer should have a name and possibly an ID or some identifier. For simplicity, I'll just use a name for now.\n\nNext, the Account class should be associated with a customer and have a balance. It should allow deposits and withdrawals, and also display the balance.\n\nThen, the Bank class should manage multiple accounts. It should be able to create new accounts for customers and perform operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry on these accounts.\n\nI need to decide how to store the accounts in the Bank class. Maybe using a list or an array.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline:\n\n- Customer class:\n\n- Properties: name\n\n- Constructor: accepts name\n\n- Account class:\n\n- Properties: customer, balance\n\n- Constructor: accepts customer and initial balance\n\n- Methods: deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), getBalance()\n\n- Bank class:\n\n- Properties: list of accounts\n\n- Methods: createAccount(customer, initialBalance), deposit(accountNumber, amount), withdraw(accountNumber, amount), getBalance(accountNumber)\n\nWait, but how will I identify accounts? Maybe each account should have a unique account number.\n\nSo, I need to assign a unique account number to each account created.\n\nLet me adjust the outline:\n\n- Account class:\n\n- Properties: accountNumber, customer, balance\n\n- Constructor: accepts accountNumber, customer, initialBalance\n\n- Methods: deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), getBalance()\n\n- Bank class:\n\n- Properties: list of accounts, nextAccountNumber\n\n- Methods: createAccount(customer, initialBalance), deposit(accountNumber, amount), withdraw(accountNumber, amount), getBalance(accountNumber)\n\nI need to make sure that account numbers are unique. So, in the Bank class, I'll have a variable nextAccountNumber that increments each time a new account is created.\n\nAlso, I need a way to find an account by its account number in the list of accounts.\n\nFor the list of accounts, I can use an ArrayList<Account>.\n\nIn the createAccount method, I'll create a new Account with the next available account number and add it to the list.\n\nFor deposit, withdraw, and getBalance methods in the Bank class, I'll search for the account with the given account number and call the corresponding method on that account.\n\nI should also think about error handling. For example, what if someone tries to withdraw more than the balance? Or what if an account number doesn't exist?\n\nI'll need to decide how to handle such cases. Maybe throw an exception or return an error message.\n\nAlso, for the customer class, maybe I should include an ID in addition to the name to make it unique.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that each customer has a unique name.\n\nWait, but in reality, multiple people can have the same name. Maybe I should include an ID or use the account number as the identifier.\n\nActually, the account number will be unique, so maybe I can use that as the identifier for deposits and withdrawals.\n\nLet me define the classes more concretely.\n\nFirst, the Customer class:\n\npublic class Customer {\n\n    private String name;\n\n    public Customer(String name) {\n\n        this.name = name;\n\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n\n        return name;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nNext, the Account class:\n\npublic class Account {\n\n    private int accountNumber;\n\n    private Customer customer;\n\n    private double balance;\n\n    public Account(int accountNumber, Customer customer, double initialBalance) {\n\n        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n\n        this.customer = customer;\n\n        this.balance = initialBalance;\n\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n\n        if (amount > 0) {\n\n            balance += amount;\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n\n        if (amount > 0) {\n\n            if (amount <= balance) {\n\n                balance -= amount;\n\n            } else {\n\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance() {\n\n        return balance;\n\n    }\n\n    public int getAccountNumber() {\n\n        return accountNumber;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, the Bank class:\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class Bank {\n\n    private ArrayList<Account> accounts;\n\n    private int nextAccountNumber;\n\n    public Bank() {\n\n        accounts = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        nextAccountNumber = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    public void createAccount(Customer customer, double initialBalance) {\n\n        Account newAccount = new Account(nextAccountNumber, customer, initialBalance);\n\n        accounts.add(newAccount);\n\n        nextAccountNumber++;\n\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(int accountNumber, double amount) {\n\n        Account account = findAccount(accountNumber);\n\n        if (account != null) {\n\n            account.deposit(amount);\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(int accountNumber, double amount) {\n\n        Account account = findAccount(accountNumber);\n\n        if (account != null) {\n\n            account.withdraw(amount);\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance(int accountNumber) {\n\n        Account account = findAccount(accountNumber);\n\n        if (account != null) {\n\n            return account.getBalance();\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    private Account findAccount(int accountNumber) {\n\n        for (Account account : accounts) {\n\n            if (account.getAccountNumber() == accountNumber) {\n\n                return account;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        return null;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nFinally, I need a main class to test this banking system.\n\npublic class BankingSystem {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        Bank bank = new Bank();\n\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"Alice\");\n\n        Customer customer2 = new Customer(\"Bob\");\n\n        bank.createAccount(customer1, 1000.0);\n\n        bank.createAccount(customer2, 500.0);\n\n        try {\n\n            bank.deposit(1, 500.0);\n\n            bank.withdraw(2, 200.0);\n\n            System.out.println(\"Balance for account 1: \" + bank.getBalance(1));\n\n            System.out.println(\"Balance for account 2: \" + bank.getBalance(2));\n\n        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis should create two accounts for Alice and Bob with initial balances of 1000 and 500 respectively. Then, it deposits 500 into account 1 and withdraws 200 from account 2, and prints the balances.\n\nI need to make sure that account numbers are unique and that operations on non-existent accounts are handled properly.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that deposits and withdrawals are valid (positive amounts, sufficient balance for withdrawals).\n\nI might want to add more features later, like transferring funds between accounts, but for a simple banking system, this should suffice.\n\nI should also consider using exceptions to handle errors, which I've started to do by throwing IllegalArgumentException when appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, I could define custom exceptions for different error conditions.\n\nBut for now, this should work.\n\nLet me think about possible improvements.\n\n1. Use long or String for account numbers to handle larger accounts.\n\n2. Add methods to list all accounts or all accounts for a specific customer.\n\n3. Implement interest calculations.\n\n4. Add overdraft facilities.\n\nBut for a simple banking system, the current implementation should be sufficient.\n\nI should also consider encapsulation and make sure that properties are private and accessed through getters.\n\nIn the Customer class, name is private and accessed through getName().\n\nIn the Account class, accountNumber, customer, and balance are private, with getters as needed.\n\nIn the Bank class, accounts and nextAccountNumber are private, and operations are performed through methods.\n\nThis seems okay.\n\nI should also think about threading and concurrency, but since this is a simple simulation, I'll assume single-threaded operation.\n\nAlright, I think this is a good starting point for a simple banking system in Java.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a simple banking system in Java, we need to model three main components: `Bank`, `Account`, and `Customer`. This system should allow creating new accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, and displaying account balances.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Customer Class**:\n   - Represents a bank customer with a name.\n\n2. **Account Class**:\n   - Represents a bank account associated with a customer, including an account number and balance.\n   - Provides methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance.\n\n3. **Bank Class**:\n   - Manages multiple accounts, assigning unique account numbers.\n   - Provides methods to create new accounts, deposit, withdraw, and check balances.\n\n4. **BankingSystem Class**:\n   - A test class to demonstrate the functionality of the banking system.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\n// Customer class\nclass Customer {\n    private String name;\n\n    public Customer(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n}\n\n// Account class\nclass Account {\n    private int accountNumber;\n    private Customer customer;\n    private double balance;\n\n    public Account(int accountNumber, Customer customer, double initialBalance) {\n        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n        this.customer = customer;\n        this.balance = initialBalance;\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            if (amount <= balance) {\n                balance -= amount;\n            } else {\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n            }\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n\n    public int getAccountNumber() {\n        return accountNumber;\n    }\n}\n\n// Bank class\nclass Bank {\n    private ArrayList<Account> accounts;\n    private int nextAccountNumber;\n\n    public Bank() {\n        accounts = new ArrayList<>();\n        nextAccountNumber = 1;\n    }\n\n    public void createAccount(Customer customer, double initialBalance) {\n        Account newAccount = new Account(nextAccountNumber, customer, initialBalance);\n        accounts.add(newAccount);\n        nextAccountNumber++;\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(int accountNumber, double amount) {\n        Account account = findAccount(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            account.deposit(amount);\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(int accountNumber, double amount) {\n        Account account = findAccount(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            account.withdraw(amount);\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance(int accountNumber) {\n        Account account = findAccount(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            return account.getBalance();\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private Account findAccount(int accountNumber) {\n        for (Account account : accounts) {\n            if (account.getAccountNumber() == accountNumber) {\n                return account;\n            }\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n\n// Test class\npublic class BankingSystem {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Bank bank = new Bank();\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"Alice\");\n        Customer customer2 = new Customer(\"Bob\");\n\n        bank.createAccount(customer1, 1000.0);\n        bank.createAccount(customer2, 500.0);\n\n        try {\n            bank.deposit(1, 500.0);\n            bank.withdraw(2, 200.0);\n            System.out.println(\"Balance for account 1: \" + bank.getBalance(1));\n            System.out.println(\"Balance for account 2: \" + bank.getBalance(2));\n        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Customer Class**:\n   - Simple class with a name attribute.\n\n2. **Account Class**:\n   - Manages account operations like deposit, withdraw, and balance check.\n   - Ensures that deposits are positive and withdrawals do not exceed the balance.\n\n3. **Bank Class**:\n   - Manages multiple accounts with unique account numbers.\n   - Provides methods to interact with accounts such as deposit, withdraw, and balance inquiry.\n\n4. **BankingSystem Class**:\n   - Demonstrates the functionality by creating accounts, performing transactions, and checking balances.\n\nThis design ensures encapsulation and basic error handling for a simple banking system."
