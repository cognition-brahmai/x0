Marriage laws vary by country and even within different regions of a country, so it's important to check the specific laws where you live. Additionally, some countries have different age requirements for marriage depending on factors such as gender and whether or not the marriage is with parental consent. It's always best to consult with a legal professional or government official to determine the legal age of marriage in your area."
