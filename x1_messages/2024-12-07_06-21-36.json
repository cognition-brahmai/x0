        "content": "So, I've got this question here: if you read 20 pages of a book every day, how many pages would you have read in a non-leap year? And I need to show my work. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many days are in a non-leap year. I remember that a non-leap year has 365 days. So, if I read 20 pages every day, I just need to multiply the number of pages I read daily by the number of days in the year.\n\nSo, that's 20 pages/day \u00d7 365 days/year.\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication. 20 times 365.\n\nI can make this easier by breaking it down. I know that 20 times 300 is 6,000, and 20 times 65 is 1,300. So, 6,000 plus 1,300 equals 7,300.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 20 times 365:\n\n- 20 \u00d7 300 = 6,000\n\n- 20 \u00d7 60 = 1,200\n\n- 20 \u00d7 5 = 100\n\nNow, adding those up: 6,000 + 1,200 = 7,200, plus 100 equals 7,300.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, if I read 20 pages every day for 365 days, I would have read 7,300 pages in total.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this calculation. For example, are there days when I might not read, like maybe holidays or weekends? But the question says \"every day,\" so I should assume that I read every single day without any breaks.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm using the correct number of days in a non-leap year. I'm confident that it's 365 days.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the book has fewer than 7,300 pages. But the question doesn't specify the total number of pages in the book, so I'll assume that the book has at least 7,300 pages or that I might read multiple books to reach that total.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you read 20 pages every day for a non-leap year, you would read 7,300 pages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7300} \\]"
