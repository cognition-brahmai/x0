        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Let's create a TypeScript class called \"Vehicle\" with the specified properties and methods.\n\nFirst, we need to define the class with properties for make, model, year, and mileage. These properties will store the relevant information about the vehicle.\n\nNext, we'll include a method to calculate fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency can be calculated by dividing the mileage by the fuel consumed. We'll need to take fuel consumed as an input parameter for this method.\n\nLastly, we'll create a method to display the vehicle information in a formatted string. This method will return a string that includes all the vehicle's properties.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```typescript\nclass Vehicle {\n    make: string;\n    model: string;\n    year: number;\n    mileage: number;\n\n    constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number, mileage: number) {\n        this.make = make;\n        this.model = model;\n        this.year = year;\n        this.mileage = mileage;\n    }\n\n    calculateFuelEfficiency(fuelConsumed: number): number {\n        if (fuelConsumed <= 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Fuel consumed must be greater than zero.\");\n        }\n        return this.mileage / fuelConsumed;\n    }\n\n    displayVehicleInfo(): string {\n        return `${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}, Mileage: ${this.mileage} miles`;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst myCar = new Vehicle(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2020, 30000);\nconsole.log(myCar.displayVehicleInfo()); // Outputs: 2020 Toyota Camry, Mileage: 30000 miles\nconst efficiency = myCar.calculateFuelEfficiency(1000);\nconsole.log(`Fuel efficiency: ${efficiency} miles per unit of fuel`);\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- The `Vehicle` class has properties for make, model, year, and mileage.\n- The constructor initializes these properties.\n- The `calculateFuelEfficiency` method calculates and returns the fuel efficiency based on the provided fuel consumed.\n- The `displayVehicleInfo` method returns a formatted string containing the vehicle's information.\n\nThis should meet your requirements.
