        "content": "So I have this problem here: find the area enclosed by the polar curve r equals 2 sine theta, from theta equals 0 to theta equals pi. Okay, polar coordinates can be a bit tricky if you're not used to them, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the area enclosed by a polar curve. I think it's something like:\n\nA = 1/2 \u222b r\u00b2 d\u03b8\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, the area is equal to one-half times the integral of r squared with respect to theta, over the given interval.\n\nGiven that r = 2 sin \u03b8, I'll plug that into the formula:\n\nA = 1/2 \u222b (2 sin \u03b8)\u00b2 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nLet me square the expression inside the integral:\n\n(2 sin \u03b8)\u00b2 = 4 sin\u00b2 \u03b8.\n\nSo now, the integral becomes:\n\nA = 1/2 \u222b 4 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nI can factor out the constant 4 from the integral:\n\nA = 1/2 * 4 \u222b sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nSimplify 1/2 * 4:\n\n1/2 * 4 = 2.\n\nSo, A = 2 \u222b sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nNow, I need to integrate sin squared theta. Hmm, I remember there's a trigonometric identity that can help me with that. Let's see:\n\nsin\u00b2 \u03b8 = (1 - cos 2\u03b8)/2.\n\nYes, that's the double-angle identity for cosine.\n\nSo, substituting that in:\n\nA = 2 \u222b (1 - cos 2\u03b8)/2 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nSimplify the integrand by dividing each term by 2:\n\n(1 - cos 2\u03b8)/2 = 1/2 - (cos 2\u03b8)/2.\n\nSo, A = 2 \u222b (1/2 - (cos 2\u03b8)/2) d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nI can split the integral into two parts:\n\nA = 2 * [ \u222b 1/2 d\u03b8 - \u222b (cos 2\u03b8)/2 d\u03b8 ] from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nLet's integrate each part separately.\n\nFirst, \u222b 1/2 d\u03b8 = 1/2 \u03b8.\n\nSecond, \u222b (cos 2\u03b8)/2 d\u03b8.\n\nFor this one, I can use substitution. Let u = 2\u03b8, so du = 2 d\u03b8, which means d\u03b8 = du/2.\n\nSo, \u222b (cos u)/2 * (du/2) = \u222b cos u du / 4 = (sin u)/4.\n\nSubstituting back, (sin 2\u03b8)/4.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nA = 2 * [ (1/2 \u03b8) - (sin 2\u03b8)/4 ] evaluated from 0 to \u03c0.\n\nNow, let's evaluate this expression at the upper limit (\u03b8 = \u03c0) and the lower limit (\u03b8 = 0), and then subtract.\n\nFirst, at \u03b8 = \u03c0:\n\n(1/2 * \u03c0) - (sin 2\u03c0)/4 = (\u03c0/2) - (0)/4 = \u03c0/2.\n\nSecond, at \u03b8 = 0:\n\n(1/2 * 0) - (sin 0)/4 = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nSubtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:\n\n\u03c0/2 - 0 = \u03c0/2.\n\nNow, don't forget that we have the 2 multiplying the integral:\n\nA = 2 * (\u03c0/2) = \u03c0.\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the polar curve r = 2 sin \u03b8 from \u03b8 = 0 to \u03b8 = \u03c0 is \u03c0.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit straightforward. Let me double-check if I've done everything correctly.\n\nFirst, the formula for the area in polar coordinates is indeed A = 1/2 \u222b r\u00b2 d\u03b8.\n\nI squared r correctly: (2 sin \u03b8)\u00b2 = 4 sin\u00b2 \u03b8.\n\nFactoring out constants is fine: A = 1/2 * 4 \u222b sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8 = 2 \u222b sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8.\n\nUsing the identity sin\u00b2 \u03b8 = (1 - cos 2\u03b8)/2 is correct.\n\n Integrating term by term:\n\n\u222b 1/2 d\u03b8 = 1/2 \u03b8.\n\n\u222b (cos 2\u03b8)/2 d\u03b8 = (sin 2\u03b8)/4.\n\nEvaluating from 0 to \u03c0:\n\n[1/2 * \u03c0 - (sin 2\u03c0)/4] - [1/2 * 0 - (sin 0)/4] = \u03c0/2 - 0 = \u03c0/2.\n\nThen, A = 2 * (\u03c0/2) = \u03c0.\n\nSeems correct. But just to be thorough, let's think about what this curve looks like.\n\nr = 2 sin \u03b8 is a circle. I recall that in polar coordinates, r = a sin \u03b8 represents a circle of radius a/2 centered at (0, a/2) in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nSo, r = 2 sin \u03b8 should be a circle of radius 1, centered at (0,1) in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe area of a circle with radius 1 is indeed \u03c0, which matches my calculation.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\pi} \\]"
