        "content": "The classic novel that features the characters Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn is \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" by Mark Twain, published in 1876, and its sequel \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\" published in 1884. Both novels are set in the 19th-century Southern United States, along the Mississippi River, and explore themes of friendship, adventure, and the complexity of societal norms, particularly in the context of slavery and racism.\n\nMark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, was renowned for his use of local dialects and his critical perspective on American society. \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" is often considered one of the greatest American novels, known for its deep exploration of moral issues and its innovative narrative techniques.\n\nIn \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\" Tom is portrayed as a mischievous yet likable boy who often finds himself in various adventures with his friends, including Huckleberry Finn, a boy from the outskirts of society. The novel is set in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, inspired by Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain grew up.\n\n\"Huckleberry Finn\" continues the adventures of Huckleberry Finn, this time as the protagonist, and includes Tom Sawyer as a secondary character. The novel follows Huck as he flees from his abusive father and teams up with Jim, an enslaved man seeking freedom, on a journey down the Mississippi River. Their adventures provide a backdrop for Twain's commentary on slavery and racism.\n\nBoth novels have had a profound impact on American literature and continue to be studied and enjoyed for their literary merit and historical significance."
