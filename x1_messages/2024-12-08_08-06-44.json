        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have boxes that contain specific numbers of small, medium, and large items: 6 small, 8 medium, and 10 large per box. The customer has ordered 60 small items, 72 medium items, and 90 large items. We need to figure out how many of these boxes the company needs to send to fulfill the order.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out how many boxes are needed for each type of item separately and then see what the overall requirement is.\n\nStarting with small items:\n\nEach box has 6 small items, and the customer wants 60 small items.\n\nSo, the number of boxes needed for small items is 60 divided by 6, which is 10 boxes.\n\nNext, medium items:\n\nEach box has 8 medium items, and the customer wants 72 medium items.\n\n72 divided by 8 is 9 boxes.\n\nLastly, large items:\n\nEach box has 10 large items, and the customer wants 90 large items.\n\n90 divided by 10 is 9 boxes.\n\nNow, here's the thing: each box contains a combination of small, medium, and large items. So, if I just add up the boxes needed for each type separately, that wouldn't make sense because each box contributes to all three types.\n\nI need to find a way to combine these requirements.\n\nMaybe I should think about the ratios or find the least common multiple or something like that.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps find out how many of each type of item are in one box and see how many boxes are needed to reach or exceed the ordered quantities.\n\nBut that seems similar to what I did earlier.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each box contains 6 small, 8 medium, and 10 large items, and the customer has ordered specific numbers of each.\n\nSo, the total number of boxes needed would be determined by the item that requires the most boxes.\n\nIn other words, the item that dictates the highest number of boxes needed will be the one that requires the most boxes.\n\nFrom earlier, small items require 10 boxes, medium require 9 boxes, and large require 9 boxes.\n\nSo, the small items require the most boxes: 10.\n\nBut, if I send 10 boxes, that would cover:\n\nSmall items: 10 boxes * 6 small/items = 60 small items (exactly what's needed).\n\nMedium items: 10 boxes * 8 medium/items = 80 medium items.\n\nThe customer ordered 72 medium items, so 80 is more than enough.\n\nLarge items: 10 boxes * 10 large/items = 100 large items.\n\nThe customer ordered 90 large items, so 100 is also more than enough.\n\nWait, but is there a way to send fewer boxes and still meet the order?\n\nIf I send 9 boxes, that would cover:\n\nSmall items: 9 boxes * 6 = 54 small items, which is less than the 60 required.\n\nSo, that's not enough for small items.\n\nTherefore, I need at least 10 boxes to cover all the items.\n\nWait, but large and medium items are covered with 9 boxes, but small items need 10.\n\nSo, sending 10 boxes would cover all requirements.\n\nBut, is there a way to optimize this, maybe by adjusting the number of boxes to exactly meet the requirements?\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of boxes as x.\n\nThen, the total number of small items delivered would be 6x, medium items 8x, and large items 10x.\n\nThe customer wants:\n\n6x >= 60\n\n8x >= 72\n\n10x >= 90\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer x that satisfies all three inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 6x >= 60 => x >= 10\n\nSecond inequality: 8x >= 72 => x >= 9\n\nThird inequality: 10x >= 90 => x >= 9\n\nSo, the most restrictive condition is x >= 10 from the small items.\n\nTherefore, the company needs to send at least 10 boxes to fulfill the order.\n\nWait, but if they send 10 boxes, they will have:\n\nSmall items: 6*10 = 60\n\nMedium items: 8*10 = 80\n\nLarge items: 10*10 = 100\n\nThe customer ordered 60, 72, and 90 respectively, so medium and large items are overdelivered, but that should be acceptable since the customer can't return items or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company can send fewer boxes and supplement with loose items, but the problem states that products are sold in boxes, implying that items are only sent in boxes.\n\nTherefore, the company needs to send 10 boxes to fulfill the order.\n\nBut let me check if there is a way to send fewer boxes by combining different box configurations.\n\nWait, maybe some boxes have different compositions, but in this problem, all boxes have the same composition: 6 small, 8 medium, and 10 large.\n\nSo, no, all boxes are identical.\n\nTherefore, the only way to fulfill the order is by sending entire boxes, and the minimum number required is 10 boxes.\n\nYes, that seems to be the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
