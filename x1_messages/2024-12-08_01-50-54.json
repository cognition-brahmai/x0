The battle was a significant conflict during the Napoleonic Wars, pitting French forces under Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte against an Allied army consisting of British, Dutch, and German troops, led by the Duke of Wellington, and Prussian forces under Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher. The battle resulted in a decisive victory for the Allies and marked the final defeat of Napoleon, leading to his exile on the island of Saint Helena."
