        "content": "I know Newton is famous for his work on gravity and motion, but I didn't realize he also worked on optics. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nWell, according to this source from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Newton made significant contributions to optics. He discovered that white light is made up of different colors. That's pretty cool! He even wrote a whole book about it called \"Opticks\" in 1704.\n\nSo, besides his work on gravity and motion, Newton was also a pioneer in understanding light and color. It's interesting how one person can make such big discoveries in multiple fields.\n\nI guess that's why they say he's one of the most influential scientists of all time. It's not just one area; he made groundbreaking contributions in several areas of science.\n\nI should probably look more into his work on optics sometime. It sounds fascinating.\n\n**Source:**\n\n- [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Entry on Quantum Mechanics History](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-history/#NewtPrin)\n\n**Additional Reading:**\n\n- Newton, I.
