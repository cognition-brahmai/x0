        "content": "The first woman to win a Nobel Prize in both Physics and Chemistry was Marie Curie. She was a pioneering researcher in the field of radioactivity. In 1903, she shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity. Then, in 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. Marie Curie's groundbreaking work significantly advanced our understanding of radioactivity and its applications in science and medicine."
