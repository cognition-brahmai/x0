        "content": "Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, phenomena, and processes outside Earth's atmosphere. It encompasses a wide range of topics, from understanding the birth and death of stars to the evolution of galaxies and the structure of the universe itself. At its core, astronomy seeks to answer fundamental questions about the origin, nature, and fate of the cosmos.\n\nStars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by their own gravity. They generate energy through nuclear fusion in their cores, primarily converting hydrogen into helium. Stars come in various sizes, temperatures, and stages of evolution, forming the building blocks of galaxies. Our own star, the Sun, is a medium-sized, middle-aged star that provides the energy sustaining life on Earth.\n\nGalaxies are vast systems composed of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, bound together by gravity. They can contain hundreds of billions of stars and span thousands of light-years in diameter. Galaxies come in different shapes and sizes, such as spiral, elliptical, and irregular. The Milky Way, our home galaxy, is a spiral galaxy containing our Solar System. Galaxies can interact and merge, influencing their structures and star formation rates.\n\nPlanets are celestial bodies that orbit stars and are not stars themselves. They are characterized by their spherical shape due to their own gravity and by having cleared their orbits of other debris. Planets can be terrestrial (rocky) or gaseous, and they vary greatly in size, composition, and environmental conditions. In our Solar System, there are eight recognized planets, ranging from small, dense Mercury to large, gaseous Jupiter. The study of exoplanets\u2014planets orbiting other stars\u2014has revealed a diverse array of worlds, expanding our understanding of planetary systems and the potential for life elsewhere in the universe."
