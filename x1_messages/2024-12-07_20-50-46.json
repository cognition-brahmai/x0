        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To calculate the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers in Python, you can use the following script:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    # Calculate mean\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate median\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    n = len(sorted_numbers)\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        median = (sorted_numbers[n//2 - 1] + sorted_numbers[n//2]) / 2\n    else:\n        median = sorted_numbers[n//2]\n    \n    # Calculate mode\n    from collections import Counter\n    count = Counter(numbers)\n    max_count = max(count.values())\n    mode = [num for num, freq in count.items() if freq == max_count]\n    \n    return mean, median, mode\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]\nmean, median, mode = calculate_statistics(numbers)\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean)\nprint(\"Median:\", median)\nprint(\"Mode:\", mode)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `calculate_statistics` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean, median, and mode. Here's a brief explanation of each step:\n\n1. **Mean**: The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers in the list and then dividing by the count of numbers.\n2. **Median**: The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n3. **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. If there are multiple numbers with the same highest frequency, all are considered modes.\n\nYou can test this function with different lists of numbers to see how it works. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
