Kangaroos are well-known for their distinctive features, including the pouch where they carry their joeys (young kangaroos) and their strong hind legs that are adapted for hopping, which is their primary mode of locomotion. There are several species of kangaroos, with the red kangaroo being the largest living marsupial."
