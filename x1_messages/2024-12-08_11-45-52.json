        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that checks if a string of parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced. If it is, I need to print \"Balanced\"; otherwise, \"Not Balanced\". Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"balanced\" means in this context. I think it means that every opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and they are properly nested. For example, \"([])\" is balanced, but \"([)]\" is not.\n\nSo, the symbols involved are parentheses '()', brackets '[]', and braces '{}'. I need to check if these are correctly matched and nested.\n\nI recall that a stack is a good data structure for this kind of problem because it follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, which is perfect for matching pairs of symbols.\n\nHere's a plan:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n\n2. If the character is an opening symbol (i.e., '(', '[', '{'), push it onto the stack.\n\n3. If it's a closing symbol (i.e., ')', ']', '}'), check if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's no matching opening symbol, so it's not balanced.\n\n4. If the stack is not empty, pop the top element and check if it matches the closing symbol. If it doesn't, it's not balanced.\n\n5. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all symbols were properly matched and nested, so it's balanced. If the stack still has elements, it's not balanced.\n\nI need to define what it means for opening and closing symbols to match. For example, '(' matches ')', '[' matches ']', and '{' matches '}'.\n\nI should also consider that there might be other characters in the string besides these symbols. Should I ignore them or consider them part of the expression? The task says \"a string of parentheses, brackets, and braces,\" so I think it's safe to assume that the string consists only of these characters.\n\nLet me think about some examples to test my logic:\n\n- \"()\" should be balanced.\n\n- \"([])\" should be balanced.\n\n- \"([)]\" should not be balanced.\n\n- \"{[()]}\" should be balanced.\n\n- \"{[(])}\" should not be balanced.\n\n- \"{{[[(())]]}}\" should be balanced.\n\n- \"((()\" should not be balanced.\n\nOkay, now let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nI'll need a stack. In Python, I can use a list as a stack, with append() to push and pop() to pop elements.\n\nI'll need a way to check if a symbol is an opening or closing symbol. I can use sets or dictionaries for this.\n\nMaybe I can create a dictionary that maps opening symbols to their corresponding closing symbols.\n\nFor example:\n\nsymbol_map = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}\n\nThen, when I encounter an opening symbol, I push it onto the stack. When I encounter a closing symbol, I check if it matches the top of the stack.\n\nWait, but in Python, checking the top of the stack without popping it can be done by accessing stack[-1].\n\nSo, here's some pseudocode:\n\nfor each character in the string:\n\nif character is in symbol_map (opening symbol):\n\npush it onto the stack\n\nelse:\n\nif stack is empty:\n\nnot balanced\n\nelse:\n\npop the top element from the stack\n\nif symbol_map[poppped_element] != character:\n\nnot balanced\n\nafter processing all characters:\n\nif stack is empty:\n\nbalanced\n\nelse:\n\nnot balanced\n\nThat seems pretty solid.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases:\n\n- Empty string: Should be balanced since there are no unmatched symbols.\n\n- Single symbol, like '(', should be not balanced.\n\n- Symbols in various orders and depths.\n\nI should also consider that the input string might contain spaces or other characters, but as per the task, it's only parentheses, brackets, and braces.\n\nAlright, time to start writing some code.\n\nFirst, I'll define the symbol_map dictionary.\n\nThen, initialize an empty list as the stack.\n\nThen, iterate through each character in the string.\n\nCheck if it's an opening symbol, if so, push it onto the stack.\n\nIf it's a closing symbol, check if the stack is empty or if the corresponding opening symbol doesn't match, then it's not balanced.\n\nFinally, after processing all characters, check if the stack is empty.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the script.\n\nI can write a function, say, is_balanced(s), that takes a string s and returns \"Balanced\" or \"Not Balanced\".\n\nBut since the task says to print \"Balanced\" or \"Not Balanced\", I can directly print within the function or in the main code.\n\nAlternatively, I can write the logic in the main block.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll write the logic in the main block.\n\nLet me sketch a rough version:\n\nsymbol_map = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}\n\nstack = []\n\nfor char in input_string:\n\nif char in symbol_map:\n\nstack.append(char)\n\nelif not stack or symbol_map[stack.pop()] != char:\n\nprint(\"Not Balanced\")\n\nexit()\n\nif not stack:\n\nprint(\"Balanced\")\n\nelse:\n\nprint(\"Not Balanced\")\n\nHmm, that seems concise.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the script accepts the input string.\n\nI can read the input string from the user using input() function.\n\nWait, but in a script, it's often better to accept input via command-line arguments.\n\nFor now, to keep it simple, I'll use input().\n\nSo, input_string = input(\"Enter the string of parentheses, brackets, and braces: \")\n\nThen, proceed with the above logic.\n\nLet me think about potential errors.\n\nWhat if the input string contains characters other than the expected symbols?\n\nAccording to the task, it's a string of only parentheses, brackets, and braces, so I don't need to handle other characters.\n\nBut to make the script more robust, maybe I should ignore any other characters.\n\nWait, but the task specifies that it's a string of these symbols, so I'll assume only these characters are present.\n\nAnother thing: what if the stack is empty when I try to pop an element?\n\nIn Python, popping from an empty list raises an IndexError.\n\nBut in my logic, before popping, I check if the stack is empty, so it should be fine.\n\nLet me test this logic with some examples mentally.\n\nExample 1: \"()\"\n\n- char '(', push onto stack\n\n- char ')', check stack is not empty, pop '(', check symbol_map['('] == ')', which matches\n\n- after loop, stack is empty, so \"Balanced\"\n\nGood.\n\nExample 2: \"([])\"\n\n- '(', push\n\n- '[', push\n\n- ']', pop '(', but symbol_map['('] == ')', which doesn't match ']', so \"Not Balanced\"\n\nWait, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no, in this logic, when I encounter ']', I check if symbol_map[stack.pop()] == ']', but stack.pop() would be '[', and symbol_map['['] == ']', which matches, so continue.\n\nWait, no, actually, stack.append('('), then stack.append('['), then char = ']', which is a closing symbol.\n\nSo, check if stack is not empty, then pop '[' , and check if symbol_map['['] == ']', which is true.\n\nThen, continue.\n\nNext char ')', which is a closing symbol.\n\nCheck if stack is not empty, pop '(', and check if symbol_map['('] == ')', which matches.\n\nFinally, stack is empty, so \"Balanced\"\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nEarlier, I had a mental slip.\n\nAnother example: \"([)]\"\n\n- '(', push\n\n- '[', push\n\n- ')', pop '[', but symbol_map['['] == ']', which doesn't match ')', so \"Not Balanced\"\n\nCorrect.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother example: \"{[()]}\"\n\n- '{', push\n\n- '[', push\n\n- '(', push\n\n- ')', pop '[', symbol_map['['] == ']', which doesn't match ')', so \"Not Balanced\"\n\nWait, no, in this logic, when I encounter ')', I should pop '(', not '[`.\n\nWait, no, the stack has '{', '[', '('.\n\nWhen I encounter ')', I pop '(', and symbol_map['('] == ')', which matches.\n\nThen, next char '}', pop '[', symbol_map['['] == ']', which doesn't match '}', so \"Not Balanced\"\n\nWait, no, actually, symbol_map['['] == ']', which doesn't match '}', so \"Not Balanced\"\n\nWait, but in reality, \"{[()]}\" should be balanced.\n\nWait, maybe my logic is flawed.\n\nWait, let's simulate step by step:\n\n- char '{', push stack: ['{']\n\n- char '[', push stack: ['{', '[']\n\n- char '(', push stack: ['{', '[', '(']\n\n- char ')', pop '(', symbol_map['('] == ')', which matches, continue\n\n- char ']', pop '[', symbol_map['['] == ']', which matches, continue\n\n- char '}', pop '{', symbol_map['{'] == '}', which matches, continue\n\n- end of string, stack is empty, \"Balanced\"\n\nWait, in my earlier mental simulation, I mistakenly popped the wrong element.\n\nIn Python's list, pop() removes the last element, which is correct for a stack.\n\nSo, yes, it should work.\n\nAnother example: \"{[(])}\"\n\n- '{', push ['{']\n\n- '[', push ['{', '[']\n\n- '(', push ['{', '[', '(']\n\n- ')', pop '(', symbol_map['('] == ')', which matches, continue\n\n- ']', pop '[', symbol_map['['] == ']', which matches, continue\n\n- '}', pop '{', symbol_map['{'] == '}', which matches, continue\n\n- end of string, stack is empty, \"Balanced\"\n\nWait, but \"{[(])}\" should not be balanced.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- '{', push ['{']\n\n- '[', push ['{', '[']\n\n- '(', push ['{', '[', '(']\n\n- ')', pop '(', symbol_map['('] == ')', which matches, continue\n\n- ']', pop '[', symbol_map['['] == ']', which matches, continue\n\n- '}', pop '{', symbol_map['{'] == '}', which matches, continue\n\nWait, but in \"{[(])}\", the sequence is { [ ( ) ] }, which is actually not balanced because the brackets are misnested.\n\nWait, no, in this simulation, it seems balanced, but it shouldn't be.\n\nWait, maybe my logic is incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me check the sequence again.\n\nIn \"{[(])}\", it should be:\n\n- '{' pushed\n\n- '[' pushed\n\n- '(' pushed\n\n- ')' pops '(' and matches\n\n- ']' pops '{' (since '{' is on top), but symbol_map['{'] == '}', which doesn't match ']', so \"Not Balanced\"\n\nWait, no, stack after popping '(': ['{', '[']\n\nThen, ']', pops '[', symbol_map['['] == ']', which matches\n\nThen, '}', pops '{', symbol_map['{'] == '}', which matches\n\nSo, it should be \"Balanced\", but actually, it's not balanced because the sequence is \"{[)]}\", which is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, in \"{[(])}\", the sequence is { [ ( ) ] }, which is indeed incorrect because the brackets are mismatched.\n\nWait, in my earlier simulation, it seemed balanced, but it shouldn't be.\n\nWait, perhaps my logic is flawed.\n\nLet me try again:\n\n- '{' pushed, stack: ['{']\n\n- '[' pushed, stack: ['{', '[']\n\n- '(' pushed, stack: ['{', '[', '(']\n\n- ')' popped, stack: ['{', '['], check symbol_map['('] == ')', which matches\n\n- ']' popped, stack: ['{'], check symbol_map['['] == ']', which matches\n\n- '}' popped, stack: [], check symbol_map['{'] == '}', which matches\n\n- stack is empty, \"Balanced\"\n\nBut this sequence is actually not balanced because the brackets are mismatched.\n\nWait, perhaps my logic is correct, and the sequence is balanced.\n\nWait, no, \"{[(])}\" is not balanced.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the string.\n\nLet me check:\n\n\"{ [ ( ] ) }\"\n\nThat would be { [ ( ] ) }, which is not balanced because the brackets don't match properly.\n\nWait, but according to my logic, it seems balanced.\n\nHmm, perhaps my logic is flawed.\n\nWait, maybe I need to pop the top element and check if it matches the current closing symbol.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- Use a stack to keep track of opening symbols.\n\n- When encountering a closing symbol, pop the top element and check if it matches.\n\n- If at any point there's a mismatch or the stack is empty when trying to pop, it's not balanced.\n\n- After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it's balanced.\n\nWait, that's what I have already.\n\nMaybe I need to verify with more examples.\n\nAnother example: \"({[]})\"\n\n- '(', push ['(']\n\n- '{', push ['(', '{']\n\n- '[', push ['(', '{', '[']\n\n- ']', pop '[', symbol_map['['] == ']', which matches\n\n- '}', pop '{', symbol_map['{'] == '}', which matches\n\n- ')', pop '(', symbol_map['('] == ')', which matches\n\n- stack is empty, \"Balanced\"\n\nGood.\n\nAnother example: \"({[}])\"\n\n- '(', push ['(']\n\n- '{', push ['(', '{']\n\n- '[', push ['(', '{', '[']\n\n- '}', pop '[', symbol_map['['] == ']', which doesn't match '}', \"Not Balanced\"\n\nCorrect.\n\nWait, in my earlier example, \"{[(])}\", which is \"{ [ ) ] }\", according to my logic:\n\n- '{' pushed ['{']\n\n- '[' pushed ['{', '[']\n\n- '(' pushed ['{', '[', '(']\n\n- ')' popped '(', symbol_map['('] == ')', matches\n\n- ']' popped '[', symbol_map['['] == ']', matches\n\n- '}' popped '{', symbol_map['{'] == '}', matches\n\n- stack is empty, \"Balanced\"\n\nBut this should not be balanced because the sequence is \"{ [ ) ] }\", which has mismatched brackets.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when popping, I should check if the top of the stack matches the current closing symbol.\n\nWait, no, I think my logic is correct, and \"{[(])}\" is actually balanced according to my simulation.\n\nBut intuitively, it seems incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe my intuition is wrong.\n\nLet me check online or with a friend.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look up how nesting works.\n\nIn nesting, each opening symbol should have a corresponding closing symbol in the correct order.\n\nIn \"{[(])}\", it's \"{ [ ( ) ] }\", which seems balanced to me.\n\nWait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier.\n\nLet me re-express it:\n\n\"{ [ ( ) ] }\"\n\n- '{' opened, then '[' opened, then '(' opened, then ')' closed, matching '('\n\n- then ']' closed, matching '['\n\n- then '}' closed, matching '{'\n\nSo, yes, it's balanced.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was not balanced, but according to the matching, it is balanced.\n\nMaybe I confused it with \"{ [ ( ] ) }\", which would be \"{ [ ) ] }\", which is not balanced.\n\nWait, in that case:\n\n- '{' pushed ['{']\n\n- '[' pushed ['{', '[']\n\n- '(' pushed ['{', '[', '(']\n\n- ']' popped '(', symbol_map['('] == ')', which doesn't match ']', \"Not Balanced\"\n\nYes, that would be \"Not Balanced\"\n\nSo, in my earlier simulation, I had a typo or misinterpretation.\n\nTherefore, my logic seems correct.\n\nAlright, I think I'm ready to write the code now.\n\nI need to make sure to handle all edge cases and ensure that the script prints the correct output.\n\nI should also consider performance, but for this task, it's not a concern since the input is expected to be small.\n\nI need to write a clean and readable code.\n\nLet me summarize the steps again:\n\n1. Define a dictionary that maps opening symbols to their corresponding closing symbols.\n\n2. Initialize an empty list to use as a stack.\n\n3. Iterate through each character in the input string.\n\na. If the character is an opening symbol, push it onto the stack.\n\nb. If it's a closing symbol:\n\ni. If the stack is empty, print \"Not Balanced\" and exit.\n\nii. Pop the top element from the stack.\n\niii. If the corresponding closing symbol doesn't match the current character, print \"Not Balanced\" and exit.\n\n4. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, print \"Balanced\"; otherwise, print \"Not Balanced\".\n\nI need to implement this logic in Python.\n\nI should also handle the input gracefully, but since the task is simple, using input() should suffice.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to check if the parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}` in a given string are balanced. This means that every opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and they are properly nested.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Use a Stack**: We will use a stack to keep track of opening symbols.\n2. **Mapping Symbols**: Use a dictionary to map opening symbols to their corresponding closing symbols.\n3. **Iterate Through the String**:\n   - If an opening symbol is encountered, push it onto the stack.\n   - If a closing symbol is encountered, check if it matches the expected closing symbol from the top of the stack.\n4. **Check Stack**: After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if the string is balanced.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef check_balanced(s):\n    # Mapping of opening to closing symbols\n    symbol_map = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}\n    # Initialize an empty stack\n    stack = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char in symbol_map:\n            # It's an opening symbol; push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        else:\n            # It's a closing symbol\n            if not stack or symbol_map[stack.pop()] != char:\n                print(\"Not Balanced\")\n                return\n    # After processing all characters, check if stack is empty\n    if not stack:\n        print(\"Balanced\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Not Balanced\")\n\n# Read input from the user\ninput_string = input(\"Enter the string of parentheses, brackets, and braces: \")\ncheck_balanced(input_string)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Definition**: We define a dictionary `symbol_map` that maps opening symbols to their corresponding closing symbols.\n2. **Stack Initialization**: We use a list `stack` to keep track of opening symbols.\n3. **Processing Each Character**:\n   - If the character is an opening symbol, it is pushed onto the stack.\n   - If it is a closing symbol, we check if it matches the expected closing symbol based on the top of the stack. If not, the string is not balanced.\n4. **Final Check**: After processing the entire string, if the stack is empty, all symbols were properly matched and nested, indicating the string is balanced.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly validate the balancing of different types of parentheses, brackets, and braces in the string."
