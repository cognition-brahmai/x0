        "content": "Alright, I'm going to write a Java program that reads a CSV file with user information\u2014names, ages, and emails\u2014and saves this data into an SQLite database. I need to make sure that the program handles errors well, especially for invalid inputs and duplicate entries.\n\nFirst, I need to set up my project. Since I'm using Java, I'll need to include the SQLite JDBC driver in my project dependencies. If I'm using Maven, I can add the dependency in the pom.xml file like this:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>\n    <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>\n    <version>3.36.0.3</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nNext, I need to design the SQLite database. I'll create a table to store user information. The table should have columns for name, age, and email. I'll make sure that the email column has a unique constraint to prevent duplicate entries.\n\nHere's the SQL statement to create the table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    age INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\nNow, I need to read the CSV file. I'll use Java's built-in classes for file I/O. I need to handle cases where the file doesn't exist or can't be read. I should also parse the CSV correctly, assuming that it's comma-separated and doesn't contain quotes or other special characters.\n\nI'll use a `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line. For each line, I'll split it by commas to get the name, age, and email.\n\nBut, I should consider that names might contain spaces, and ages might not be valid integers. I need to handle these cases appropriately.\n\nTo interact with the SQLite database, I'll use JDBC. I need to establish a connection to the database, create the table if it doesn't exist, and then insert the user data.\n\nI need to handle exceptions that may occur during file reading, database connection, and SQL execution. For duplicate entries, I'll catch the exception that occurs when trying to insert a duplicate email and handle it accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Establish a connection to the SQLite database.\n\n2. Create the users table if it doesn't exist.\n\n3. Read the CSV file line by line.\n\n4. For each line:\n\na. Split the line into name, age, and email.\n\nb. Validate the age to ensure it's a valid integer.\n\nc. Try to insert the user into the database.\n\nd. If a duplicate email is detected, handle the error.\n\n5. Close all resources.\n\nI need to make sure to close the database connection and file readers properly, even if errors occur. I'll use try-with-resources to handle this.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the CSV file might have a header row that I need to skip.\n\nLet me think about error handling in more detail:\n\n- If the CSV file doesn't exist or can't be read, I should print an error message.\n\n- If a line in the CSV doesn't have exactly three fields, I should skip that line and log an error.\n\n- If the age is not a valid integer, I should skip that entry and log an error.\n\n- If there's a duplicate email, I should log an error and skip inserting that user.\n\nI should also think about the user experience. Maybe I can keep track of the number of successful inserts and the number of errors, and print a summary at the end.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.sql.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class CsvToSqlite {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String url = \"jdbc:sqlite:user_data.db\";\n        String csvPath = \"users.csv\";\n\n        try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url)) {\n            createTable(conn);\n            readAndInsertCsv(conn, csvPath);\n        } catch (SQLException | IOException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void createTable(Connection conn) throws SQLException {\n        String sql = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\" +\n                \"id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\" +\n                \"name TEXT NOT NULL,\" +\n                \"age INTEGER NOT NULL,\" +\n                \"email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL\" +\n                \");\";\n        try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {\n            stmt.execute(sql);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void readAndInsertCsv(Connection conn, String csvPath) throws IOException, SQLException {\n        int successCount = 0;\n        int errorCount = 0;\n\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(csvPath))) {\n            String line;\n            boolean firstLine = true;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                if (firstLine) {\n                    firstLine = false;\n                    continue; // Skip header\n                }\n                String[] values = line.split(\",\");\n                if (values.length != 3) {\n                    System.err.println(\"Invalid line: \" + line);\n                    errorCount++;\n                    continue;\n                }\n                String name = values[0].trim();\n                String ageStr = values[1].trim();\n                String email = values[2].trim();\n\n                try {\n                    int age = Integer.parseInt(ageStr);\n                    if (insertUser(conn, name, age, email)) {\n                        successCount++;\n                    } else {\n                        errorCount++;\n                    }\n                } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n                    System.err.println(\"Invalid age: \" + ageStr);\n                    errorCount++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Import completed.\");\n        System.out.println(\"Successful inserts: \" + successCount);\n        System.out.println(\"Errors: \" + errorCount);\n    }\n\n    private static boolean insertUser(Connection conn, String name, int age, String email) throws SQLException {\n        String sql = \"INSERT INTO users(name, age, email) VALUES(?,?,?)\";\n        try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n            pstmt.setString(1, name);\n            pstmt.setInt(2, age);\n            pstmt.setString(3, email);\n            pstmt.executeUpdate();\n            return true;\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            if (e.getErrorCode() == 19 || e.getSQLState().equals(\"23505\")) {\n                System.err.println(\"Duplicate email: \" + email);\n            } else {\n                System.err.println(\"Error inserting user: \" + e.getMessage());\n            }\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- I establish a connection to an SQLite database named `user_data.db`.\n\n- I create a table named `users` if it doesn't exist.\n\n- I read the CSV file specified by `csvPath`, skipping the header row.\n\n- For each valid line in the CSV, I parse the name, age, and email, and insert the user into the database.\n\n- I handle errors for invalid lines, invalid ages, and duplicate emails.\n\n- I use try-with-resources to ensure that resources are closed properly.\n\nI need to make sure that the CSV file is in the correct format and that the database driver is included in the classpath.\n\nThis should cover the basic requirements. If there are more specific requirements or edge cases, I can adjust the code accordingly."
