        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a circular pond with a diameter of 12 feet, and I want to build a walkway around it that's 3 feet wide. I need to figure out the area of just the walkway. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since the pond is circular, I know that the area of a circle is given by the formula A equals pi times the radius squared, right? So, area equals pi R squared. But here, I have both the pond and the walkway to consider.\n\nThe pond has a diameter of 12 feet, so its radius is half of that, which is 6 feet. So, the area of the pond is pi times 6 squared, which is 36 pi square feet.\n\nNow, the walkway is 3 feet wide and it goes around the pond. So, the outer edge of the walkway would be 3 feet beyond the pond's edge all around. That means the radius of the entire area, including the pond and the walkway, would be the pond's radius plus the walkway's width. So, 6 feet plus 3 feet equals 9 feet.\n\nTherefore, the area of the entire region, including the pond and the walkway, would be pi times 9 squared, which is 81 pi square feet.\n\nTo find the area of just the walkway, I need to subtract the area of the pond from the total area. So, area of walkway equals area of total minus area of pond. That would be 81 pi minus 36 pi, which is 45 pi square feet.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The walkway is like a ring around the pond, so its area should be the difference between the area of the larger circle (pond plus walkway) and the area of the pond itself. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the walkway as a series of small rings, each with a tiny width, but that seems more complicated for this problem. The method I used earlier should suffice.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can verify this with another approach. Suppose I consider the walkway as a path that's 3 feet wide around the pond. The circumference of the pond is pi times diameter, which is 12 pi feet. But if I multiply that by the width of the walkway, 3 feet, that would give me something like 36 pi square feet, which is not matching my earlier calculation of 45 pi square feet.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. Why are the two methods giving different results? Oh, wait, I see the mistake. The circumference times the width would give the area of a rectangle that's wrapped around the pond, but that's only an approximation and it's not exact for a circle. For a circular path, the exact area is indeed the difference between the areas of the two circles, which is what I calculated first as 45 pi square feet.\n\nSo, the correct area of the walkway is 45 pi square feet. The other method was an approximation and didn't account for the curvature properly.\n\nAlright, I think that's the answer. But just to be extra sure, let's plug in the value of pi and see what numbers we get.\n\nPi is approximately 3.1416. So, 45 times 3.1416 is about 141.372 square feet.\n\nIf I calculate the area of the pond: 36 pi, which is about 113.0976 square feet.\n\nAnd the total area: 81 pi, which is about 254.4672 square feet.\n\nSubtracting the pond's area from the total area: 254.4672 minus 113.0976 equals 141.372 square feet. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, yeah, the area of the walkway is 45 pi square feet, or approximately 141.37 square feet.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45\\pi} \\]"
