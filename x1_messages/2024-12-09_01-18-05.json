        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. To create a Node.js script that connects to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, lists all files within the bucket, and prints their names and sizes, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your Google Cloud project and enable the Cloud Storage API.**\n2. **Install the Google Cloud Storage client library for Node.js.**\n3. **Authenticate your application to access Google Cloud Storage.**\n4. **Write the Node.js script to list files and print their names and sizes.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Set up your Google Cloud project and enable the Cloud Storage API\n\n1. **Create a Google Cloud project:**\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n   - Create a new project or select an existing one.\n\n2. **Enable the Cloud Storage API:**\n   - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Library\".\n   - Search for \"Cloud Storage\" and enable the API for your project.\n\n3. **Create a service account and generate credentials:**\n   - Go to \"IAM & Admin\" > \"Service Accounts\".\n   - Create a new service account or select an existing one.\n   - Generate a JSON key file for the service account.\n   - Download the JSON key file and keep it in a secure location.\n\n### Step 2: Install the Google Cloud Storage client library for Node.js\n\nYou can install the Google Cloud Storage client library using npm (Node Package Manager). Run the following command in your project directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @google-cloud/storage\n```\n\n### Step 3: Authenticate your application\n\nTo authenticate your application, set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the JSON key file you downloaded earlier.\n\nFor example, if your key file is named `keyfile.json` and is located in the same directory as your script, you can set the environment variable like this:\n\n```bash\nexport GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"./keyfile.json\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set the environment variable directly in your script using the `process.env` object:\n\n```javascript\nprocess.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = './keyfile.json';\n```\n\n### Step 4: Write the Node.js script\n\nNow, you can write the Node.js script to list files in the bucket and print their names and sizes. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Import the Google Cloud Storage library\nconst { Storage } = require('@google-cloud/storage');\n\n// Create a new Storage instance\nconst storage = new Storage();\n\n// Specify the name of your bucket\nconst bucketName = 'your-bucket-name';\n\n// Function to list files in the bucket\nasync function listFiles() {\n  try {\n    // Reference to the bucket\n    const bucket = storage.bucket(bucketName);\n\n    // List files in the bucket\n    const [files] = await bucket.getFiles();\n\n    // Print file names and sizes\n    files.forEach(file => {\n      console.log(`File: ${file.name}, Size: ${file.metadata.size} bytes`);\n    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error listing files:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Call the function\nlistFiles();\n```\n\nReplace `'your-bucket-name'` with the actual name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Import the Storage library:**\n   - We import the `Storage` class from the `@google-cloud/storage` package.\n\n2. **Create a Storage instance:**\n   - We create a new instance of the `Storage` class, which allows us to interact with Google Cloud Storage.\n\n3. **Specify the bucket name:**\n   - Set the `bucketName` variable to the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket.\n\n4. **List files in the bucket:**\n   - We use the `getFiles()` method of the bucket object to retrieve a list of files.\n   - We iterate over the list of files and print each file's name and size.\n\n5. **Handle errors:**\n   - We use a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the script.\n\nThat's it! Make sure to handle your credentials securely and follow best practices for authentication and authorization in production environments.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
