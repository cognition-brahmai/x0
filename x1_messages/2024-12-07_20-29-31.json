        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a large hotel chain that wants to renovate its properties over 3 years. They have 500 hotels worldwide, each with an average of 200 rooms. Renovating each room will cost $10,000, and the company can allocate $50 million per year for renovations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We need to find out how many hotels can be renovated each year within the $50 million budget, and then calculate the total number of rooms that will be renovated over the 3-year period.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the cost to renovate a single hotel. Since each hotel has an average of 200 rooms and each room costs $10,000 to renovate, the total cost per hotel would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per hotel} = 200 \\text{ rooms} \\times \\$10,000/\\text{room} = \\$2,000,000\n\\]\n\nSo, each hotel renovation costs $2 million.\n\nNow, the company allocates $50 million per year for renovations. To find out how many hotels can be renovated each year within this budget, I'll divide the annual budget by the cost per hotel:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hotels per year} = \\frac{\\$50,000,000}{\\$2,000,000/\\text{hotel}} = 25 \\text{ hotels/year}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the company can renovate 25 hotels each year within their budget.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total number of rooms that will be renovated over the 3-year period. Since they can renovate 25 hotels per year, over 3 years that would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total hotels renovated} = 25 \\text{ hotels/year} \\times 3 \\text{ years} = 75 \\text{ hotels}\n\\]\n\nEach of these hotels has 200 rooms, so the total number of rooms renovated would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total rooms renovated} = 75 \\text{ hotels} \\times 200 \\text{ rooms/hotel} = 15,000 \\text{ rooms}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The company has 500 hotels, and they're renovating 75 hotels over 3 years. That seems manageable, but I should confirm that they aren't trying to renovate more than they have.\n\nGiven that they have 500 hotels, renovating 75 over 3 years means that not all hotels will be renovated within this period. But the question doesn't ask about that; it's only asking for how many can be renovated within the budget and the total rooms renovated over 3 years.\n\nLet me also confirm the budget allocation. Each hotel costs $2 million to renovate, and they're renovating 25 hotels per year, which would indeed be:\n\n\\[\n25 \\text{ hotels/year} \\times \\$2,000,000/\\text{hotel} = \\$50,000,000/\\text{year}\n\\]\n\nThat matches their annual allocation of $50 million. So, the calculations seem consistent.\n\nIs there any other aspect I should consider? The problem mentions that the renovations are spread over 3 years, but doesn't specify any changes in the budget or costs over time. So, I'm assuming that the budget remains constant at $50 million per year and that the costs don't change over the 3 years.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the company has 500 hotels, but they can only renovate a portion of them within the given budget and time frame. The question is focused on what can be achieved with the allocated resources, not on the entire fleet of hotels.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Hotels renovated per year: 25\n\n- Total hotels renovated over 3 years: 75\n\n- Total rooms renovated over 3 years: 15,000\n\nI think this answers the question fully. However, if I were to provide additional insight, I might consider the overall percentage of hotels renovated or the total cost over the 3 years, but the question doesn't specifically ask for that.\n\nLet me just verify the calculations one more time to be sure.\n\nStarting with:\n\n- 500 hotels\n\n- 200 rooms/hotel\n\n- $10,000 per room\n\n- $50 million per year for 3 years\n\nCalculated:\n\n- Cost per hotel: 200 rooms * $10,000 = $2,000,000\n\n- Hotels per year: $50,000,000 / $2,000,000 = 25 hotels/year\n\n- Total hotels over 3 years: 25 hotels/year * 3 years = 75 hotels\n\n- Total rooms renovated: 75 hotels * 200 rooms/hotel = 15,000 rooms\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident with these answers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15000} \\]"
