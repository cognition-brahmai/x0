        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are students in three different grades: 9, 10, and 11. Specifically, there are 120 students in grade 9, 150 in grade 10, and 180 in grade 11. Each student needs 5 notebooks for the upcoming semester. The question is, how many notebooks does the school need to order in total?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to find out the total number of students across all three grades. So, I'll add up the numbers:\n\n120 (grade 9) + 150 (grade 10) + 180 (grade 11)\n\nLet's do that addition step by step.\n\n120 plus 150 is 270.\n\nThen, 270 plus 180 is 450.\n\nSo, there are 450 students in total.\n\nNow, each student needs 5 notebooks. Therefore, to find the total number of notebooks needed, I should multiply the total number of students by the number of notebooks per student.\n\nThat is: 450 students \u00d7 5 notebooks/student.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n450 \u00d7 5.\n\nWell, 400 \u00d7 5 is 2000.\n\nAnd 50 \u00d7 5 is 250.\n\nSo, 2000 + 250 equals 2250.\n\nTherefore, the school needs to order 2250 notebooks.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this to double-check my answer?\n\nMaybe I can calculate the notebooks needed for each grade separately and then add them up.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor grade 9: 120 students \u00d7 5 notebooks = 600 notebooks.\n\nFor grade 10: 150 students \u00d7 5 notebooks = 750 notebooks.\n\nFor grade 11: 180 students \u00d7 5 notebooks = 900 notebooks.\n\nNow, add those up: 600 + 750 + 900.\n\n600 plus 750 is 1350.\n\n1350 plus 900 is 2250.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the school needs to order 2250 notebooks.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider. For example, are there any students who might need more or fewer notebooks? The problem says each student needs 5 notebooks, so I'll assume that's consistent across all students.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention anything about extra notebooks for the school or teachers, so I'll stick with the student count.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2250 notebooks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2250} \\]"
