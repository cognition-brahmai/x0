        "content": "Let's see. I need to figure out how far I'll travel if I drive at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours and 45 minutes. Okay, so the formula for distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance equals speed times time.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the time is in the same units as the speed. The speed is in miles per hour, so the time should be in hours. I have 3 hours and 45 minutes. I know that 45 minutes is 45/60 of an hour because there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 45 divided by 60 is 0.75. Therefore, 3 hours and 45 minutes is equal to 3.75 hours.\n\nNow, I can plug the values into the formula:\n\nDistance = 60 mph \u00d7 3.75 hours\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n60 \u00d7 3.75\n\nWell, 60 times 3 is 180, and 60 times 0.75 is 45. So, 180 plus 45 equals 225.\n\nTherefore, I will travel 225 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I'm driving at 60 miles per hour, that means I cover 60 miles every hour. In 3 hours, I would cover 180 miles, and in another 45 minutes, which is 0.75 of an hour, I would cover an additional 45 miles. So, yes, 180 plus 45 is indeed 225 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the time entirely into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 45 minutes, which totals 225 minutes. Then, since the speed is 60 miles per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, that means I'm traveling at 1 mile per minute. So, in 225 minutes, I would travel 225 miles. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also use the formula for distance again, but ensuring that the units are consistent. Speed is 60 miles per hour, time is 3.75 hours, and distance is indeed 225 miles.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 225 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{225} \\]"
