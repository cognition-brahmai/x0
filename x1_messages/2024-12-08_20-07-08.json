        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the garden has an area of 200 square meters and a width of 10 meters. I need to find out the length of the garden and also what the perimeter would be if someone were to walk around it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas for the area and perimeter of a rectangle. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. That makes sense because area is basically the space inside the rectangle.\n\nGiven that the area is 200 square meters and the width is 10 meters, I can set up an equation to solve for the length. So, area equals length times width, which is 200 = length \u00d7 10.\n\nTo find the length, I can divide both sides of the equation by 10. So, length equals 200 divided by 10, which is 20 meters. Okay, so the length of the garden is 20 meters.\n\nNext, I need to find the perimeter. The perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle. I think the formula for perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width, or something like that. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the perimeter would be 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, perimeter equals 2L plus 2W.\n\nI've already found that the length L is 20 meters and the width W is 10 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, perimeter equals 2 times 20 plus 2 times 10.\n\nThat would be 40 plus 20, which equals 60 meters.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the garden is 60 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate the perimeter? Maybe I can use the area to check my answer or something. But I don't think that's necessary here because I have both the length and the width, and I've applied the formula correctly.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, area equals length times width: 200 = L \u00d7 10. Solving for L, L = 200 / 10 = 20 meters. That seems correct.\n\nThen, perimeter equals 2L + 2W = 2(20) + 2(10) = 40 + 20 = 60 meters. That also seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. The length of the garden is 20 meters, and the perimeter is 60 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe length of the garden is \\boxed{20} meters and the perimeter is \\boxed{60} meters."
