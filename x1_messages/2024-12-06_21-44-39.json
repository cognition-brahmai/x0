        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a Python script that interacts with Amazon S3 using the Boto3 library. This script will allow you to upload, download, and list objects in a specified S3 bucket. We'll make sure to handle authentication and error handling properly.\n\nFirst, you'll need to have Boto3 installed. If you don't have it already, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install boto3\n```\n\nNext, you need to set up your AWS credentials. The simplest way is to use the AWS CLI to configure your credentials:\n\n```bash\naws configure\n```\n\nThis will prompt you to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.\n\nNow, let's start writing the script. We'll break it down into functions for uploading, downloading, and listing objects.\n\n### Uploading an Object\n\nTo upload a file to S3, you can use the `upload_file` method provided by Boto3.\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError\n\ndef upload_to_s3(file_name, bucket_name, object_name=None):\n    if object_name is None:\n        object_name = file_name\n\n    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n    try:\n        response = s3_client.upload_file(file_name, bucket_name, object_name)\n        print(f\"File {file_name} uploaded to {bucket_name}/{object_name}\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"The file was not found\")\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available\")\n    except PartialCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Incomplete credentials\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Downloading an Object\n\nTo download a file from S3, you can use the `download_file` method.\n\n```python\ndef download_from_s3(bucket_name, object_name, file_name=None):\n    if file_name is None:\n        file_name = object_name\n\n    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n    try:\n        s3_client.download_file(bucket_name, object_name, file_name)\n        print(f\"Object {object_name} downloaded from {bucket_name} to {file_name}\")\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available\")\n    except PartialCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Incomplete credentials\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Listing Objects in a Bucket\n\nTo list all objects in a specified bucket, you can use the `list_objects_v2` method.\n\n```python\ndef list_objects_in_bucket(bucket_name):\n    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n    try:\n        response = s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)\n        if 'Contents' in response:\n            for obj in response['Contents']:\n                print(obj['Key'])\n        else:\n            print(\"No objects in bucket\")\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available\")\n    except PartialCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Incomplete credentials\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\nNow, let's put these functions into a single script and add a simple menu to interact with them.\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError\n\ndef upload_to_s3(file_name, bucket_name, object_name=None):\n    if object_name is None:\n        object_name = file_name\n\n    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n    try:\n        response = s3_client.upload_file(file_name, bucket_name, object_name)\n        print(f\"File {file_name} uploaded to {bucket_name}/{object_name}\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"The file was not found\")\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available\")\n    except PartialCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Incomplete credentials\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndef download_from_s3(bucket_name, object_name, file_name=None):\n    if file_name is None:\n        file_name = object_name\n\n    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n    try:\n        s3_client.download_file(bucket_name, object_name, file_name)\n        print(f\"Object {object_name} downloaded from {bucket_name} to {file_name}\")\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available\")\n    except PartialCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Incomplete credentials\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndef list_objects_in_bucket(bucket_name):\n    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n    try:\n        response = s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)\n        if 'Contents' in response:\n            for obj in response['Contents']:\n                print(obj['Key'])\n        else:\n            print(\"No objects in bucket\")\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available\")\n    except PartialCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Incomplete credentials\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    bucket_name = 'your_bucket_name'\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nS3 Bucket Operations\")\n        print(\"1. Upload a file\")\n        print(\"2. Download a file\")\n        print(\"3. List objects in bucket\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            file_name = input(\"Enter the file path to upload: \")\n            object_name = input(\"Enter the object name in S3 (optional): \") or None\n            upload_to_s3(file_name, bucket_name, object_name)\n        elif choice == '2':\n            object_name = input(\"Enter the object name to download: \")\n            file_name = input(\"Enter the local file name (optional): \") or None\n            download_from_s3(bucket_name, object_name, file_name)\n        elif choice == '3':\n            list_objects_in_bucket(bucket_name)\n        elif choice == '4':\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Upload Function**: Uploads a local file to an S3 bucket.\n2. **Download Function**: Downloads an object from an S3 bucket to a local file.\n3. **List Objects Function**: Lists all objects in the specified S3 bucket.\n4. **Main Menu**: A simple text-based menu to choose between uploading, downloading, listing objects, or exiting the script.\n\nMake sure to replace `'your_bucket_name'` with the name of your actual S3 bucket.\n\nThis script handles basic error cases like missing files, credential issues, and other exceptions that might occur during S3 operations."
