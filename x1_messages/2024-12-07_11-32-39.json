        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village with 100 houses, each having at least one pet, and the total number of pets is 200. Additionally, no two houses have the same number of pets. We need to find out the maximum number of pets that can be in any single house.\n\nFirst, since each house has at least one pet, and no two houses have the same number of pets, the number of pets in each house must be a unique positive integer. So, the smallest possible numbers of pets in the houses would be 1, 2, 3, and so on, up to some maximum number.\n\nLet's denote the maximum number of pets in a single house as \\( k \\). Then, the number of pets in the houses would be the integers from 1 up to \\( k \\), and since there are 100 houses, \\( k \\) must be at least 100 because the sequence starts at 1 and increases by 1 each time.\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, if we have houses with pets numbering from 1 to \\( k \\), the total number of pets would be:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut we know that the total number of pets is 200, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} = 200\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nk(k + 1) = 400\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find a positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( k(k + 1) = 400 \\). Let's try to solve for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\nk^2 + k - 400 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 1600}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1601}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\sqrt{1601}\\) is approximately 40.01, so:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-1 + 40.01}{2} \\approx \\frac{39.01}{2} \\approx 19.505\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer, we can try \\( k = 19 \\) and \\( k = 20 \\) to see which one fits.\n\nFirst, for \\( k = 19 \\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{19 \\times 20}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nBut the total number of pets is 200, which is more than 190, so \\( k = 19 \\) is not sufficient.\n\nNow, for \\( k = 20 \\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{20 \\times 21}{2} = 210\n\\]\n\nThis is 210, which is more than 200. So, \\( k = 20 \\) exceeds the total number of pets.\n\nWait a minute, this seems conflicting. The sum for \\( k = 19 \\) is 190, which is less than 200, and for \\( k = 20 \\), it's 210, which is more than 200. But we have only 100 houses, and the sequence from 1 to 20 has 20 numbers, not 100.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Perhaps not all houses are assigned consecutive integers starting from 1 up to \\( k \\). Wait, but the problem states that no two houses have the same number of pets, so each house has a unique number of pets.\n\nGiven that, and there are 100 houses, the unique number of pets in each house must be 100 unique positive integers.\n\nSo, to minimize the total number of pets, the houses would have 1, 2, 3, ..., 100 pets, but that sum would be:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{100 \\times 101}{2} = 5050\n\\]\n\nBut the total number of pets is only 200, which is way less than 5050. So, something's off here.\n\nWait, perhaps not all houses have to have consecutive integers starting from 1. Maybe some houses have higher numbers, and others have lower numbers, but all unique.\n\nBut the condition is that no two houses have the same number of pets, and each has at least one pet.\n\nTo maximize the number of pets in one house, we need to minimize the number of pets in the other houses.\n\nSo, assign the smallest possible unique positive integers to 99 houses, and the remaining pets to the 100th house.\n\nThe smallest 99 unique positive integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 99.\n\nThe sum of these is:\n\n\\[\nS_{99} = \\frac{99 \\times 100}{2} = 4950\n\\]\n\nBut the total number of pets is only 200, so the 100th house would have:\n\n\\[\n200 - 4950 = -4750\n\\]\n\nWhich is impossible, as the number of pets can't be negative.\n\nThis suggests that it's impossible to have 99 houses with unique numbers of pets from 1 to 99 and still have a total of only 200 pets.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nMaybe not all houses have distinct numbers of pets greater than or equal to 1, but since the problem says every house has at least one pet and no two houses have the same number of pets, they must all have unique positive integers starting from 1 upwards.\n\nBut the sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050, which is much larger than 200.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the houses don't have distinct numbers starting from 1, but from some other lower number.\n\nWait, but the problem says each house has at least one pet, and no two houses have the same number of pets.\n\nSo, the smallest possible distinct positive integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 100.\n\nBut as we've seen, their sum is 5050, which is way above 200.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps not all houses have unique numbers of pets, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some houses have more pets, and some have fewer, but still unique counts, and the total is 200.\n\nBut again, if we try to minimize the sum for 100 unique positive integers, the minimal sum is 5050, which is greater than 200.\n\nThis suggests that the problem as stated may be impossible, or there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the houses don't necessarily have to have consecutive integer numbers of pets starting from 1, but could have any unique positive integers.\n\nSo, to minimize the sum, the smallest possible unique positive integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 100, summing to 5050.\n\nBut since the total is only 200, which is less than 5050, it's impossible to have 100 unique positive integers summing to 200.\n\nWait, but maybe not all houses have distinct numbers of pets greater than or equal to 1, but that would contradict the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some houses have only one pet, and others have more, but still unique counts, and the total is 200.\n\nBut again, the minimal sum for 100 unique positive integers is 5050, which is greater than 200.\n\nThis suggests that the problem as stated is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the houses don't all have distinct numbers of pets; only that no two houses have the same number of pets, but they can have the same number as long as it's unique.\n\nWait, no, \"no two houses have the same number of pets\" means that each house has a unique number of pets.\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for some houses to have the same number of pets, but the maximum number of pets in any single house is to be found, given that no two houses have the same number of pets.\n\nWait, no, the problem clearly states \"no two houses have the same number of pets,\" which means each house has a unique number of pets.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and it's allowed for multiple houses to have the same number of pets, but with the condition that no two houses have the same number of pets of a particular type or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to maximize the number of pets in one house given that no two houses have the same number of pets, and the total is 200 across 100 houses, each with at least one pet.\n\nGiven that, and the minimal sum being 5050, which is greater than 200, it seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for some houses to have the same number of pets, but the maximum number of pets in any single house is to be found.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"no two houses have the same number of pets,\" which implies that each house has a unique number of pets.\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to maximize the number of pets in one house while ensuring that no two houses have the same number of pets, and the total is 200.\n\nGiven that, and the minimal sum for 100 unique positive integers is 5050, which is greater than 200, it seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps not all houses have unique numbers of pets; only that no two houses have the same number of pets.\n\nWait, that's the same as saying each house has a unique number of pets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"no two houses have the same number of pets\" means that the number of pets in each house is distinct.\n\nGiven that, and the sum is 200, it seems impossible with 100 houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and it's meant to be fewer than 100 houses, or a different total number of pets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to select a subset of houses with unique numbers of pets summing to 200, and find the maximum possible in one house.\n\nBut the problem specifically mentions 100 houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum number of pets in a single house, given that the total is 200, and no two houses have the same number of pets, with at least one pet per house.\n\nGiven that, and the minimal sum for 100 unique positive integers is 5050, which is greater than 200, it seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for some houses to have zero pets, but the problem states that every house has at least one pet.\n\nWait, no, \"every house has at least one pet.\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to select a subset of houses with unique numbers of pets summing to 200, and find the maximum possible in one house.\n\nBut again, with 100 houses, it doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to have 100 houses, each with a unique number of pets, summing to 200, with each house having at least one pet, and to find the maximum number in any single house.\n\nGiven that, and the minimal sum being 5050, which is greater than 200, it seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to have 100 houses, each with a unique number of pets, and the total

constraints:\n\n- There are 100 houses.\n- Each house has at least one pet.\n- The total number of pets is 200.\n- No two houses have the same number of pets.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Consideration**:\n   - Each house must have a unique number of pets, and each must have at least one pet.\n   - To maximize the number of pets in one house, we need to minimize the number of pets in the other houses.\n\n2. **Minimizing Pets in 99 Houses**:\n   - The smallest possible unique positive integers for 99 houses are 1, 2, 3, ..., 99.\n   - The sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers is given by \\( s = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - Calculate the sum for houses with 1 to 99 pets.\n   - Subtract this sum from the total number of pets (200) to find the number of pets in the 100th house.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Check if the sum of pets in the 99 houses is less than or equal to 200.\n   - If not, determine if the problem is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of pets in the first 99 houses\nn = 99\nmin_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n\n# Total pets\ntotal_pets = 200\n\n# Pets in the 100th house\nmax_pets = total_pets - min_sum\n\n# Since min_sum should be less than or equal to total_pets for the problem to be feasible\nif min_sum <= total_pets:\n    print(max_pets)\nelse:\n    print(\"Impossible\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Sum Calculation**:\n   - The sum of pets in the first 99 houses is \\( \\frac{99 \\times 100}{2} = 4950 \\).\n\n2. **Feasibility Check**:\n   - The total number of pets is 200.\n   - The sum for 99 houses is 4950, which is greater than 200.\n   - Therefore, it is impossible to have 100 houses each with unique numbers of pets totaling 200.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The problem as stated is impossible because the minimal sum required for 99 houses exceeds the total number of pets available.\n\nThus, the answer is \"Impossible\"."
