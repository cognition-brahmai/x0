        "content": "If a car is moving at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, to find out how far it will travel in 2 hours and 30 minutes, we need to use the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nGiven that the speed is 50 miles per hour, and the time is 2 hours and 30 minutes, we first need to convert the time into hours because the speed is in miles per hour.\n\nFirst, let's convert 30 minutes into hours:\n\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, 2 hours and 30 minutes is equal to:\n\n\\[ 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, plug the values into the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 50 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 2.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 125 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the car will travel 125 miles in 2 hours and 30 minutes at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the distance traveled in 2 hours and then add the distance traveled in the additional 30 minutes.\n\n- Distance in 2 hours:\n\n\\[ 50 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 100 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n- Distance in 30 minutes:\n\nSince 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance would be half of the hourly speed:\n\n\\[ \\frac{50 \\text{ miles}}{2} = 25 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n- Total distance:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ miles} + 25 \\text{ miles} = 125 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\n**Understanding the Concept:**\n\nIt's important to ensure that the units for time and speed are compatible. In this case, since speed is given in miles per hour, time should be in hours. If time is given in minutes, it needs to be converted to hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\n\nAdditionally, understanding that average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken helps in solving these types of problems. In this scenario, we are given the average speed and the time, and we need to find the distance.\n\n**Real-World Application:**\n\nThis type of calculation is useful in various real-world scenarios, such as planning travel time, calculating fuel consumption, or determining arrival times. For example, if you're planning a road trip and know the average speed you expect to maintain, you can estimate how long it will take to reach your destination or how far you can travel within a certain time frame.\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n\n1. **Unit Inconsistency:** Make sure that the units for speed and time are compatible. Mixing hours and minutes can lead to incorrect calculations.\n\n2. **Incorrect Time Conversion:** When converting minutes to hours, remember to divide by 60, not multiply.\n\n3. **Misapplying the Formula:** Ensure you are using the correct formula. For speed, time, and distance problems, the relationships are:\n\n   - \\(\\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}\\)\n\n   - \\(\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\\)\n\n   - \\(\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}\\)\n\n4. **Decimal Misplacement:** When dealing with decimal times (like 2.5 hours), ensure that the decimal is placed correctly to avoid miscalculations.\n\nBy being mindful of these points, you can accurately solve problems involving speed, time, and distance."
