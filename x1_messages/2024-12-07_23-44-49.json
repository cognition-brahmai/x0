And being good at it is half the battle. But also, you've gotta be a people person. Because, at the end of the day, it's not about what you know, it's about who you know. Networking, schmetworking. You know, you've gotta make connections. And don't forget to laugh. Laughter is the best medicine. So, keep smiling, even when things are tough. And of course, always remember: \"That's what she said.\" Because humor can take you far in life. But seriously, dedication, hard work, and a little bit of duct tape. Duct tape fixes everything. So, there you go. That's my recipe for success. Now, who's ready for some Dundies?"
