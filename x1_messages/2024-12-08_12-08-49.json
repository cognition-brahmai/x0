        "content": "So I have this investment problem here. I need to figure out how much money I'll have after investing $5,000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, and it's compounded quarterly over 5 years. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so that's $5,000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 4%, but I need to express that as a decimal, so that's 0.04.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded quarterly, that's 4 times a year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 5 years.\n\nSo, plugging in these values:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n\n0.04 / 4 = 0.01\n\nSo, each quarter, the interest rate is 1%.\n\nNow, add 1 to that:\n\n1 + 0.01 = 1.01\n\nNext, raise that to the power of (4 times 5), which is 20:\n\n1.01^20\n\nI need to calculate 1.01 to the power of 20. Let me see:\n\n1.01^10 is approximately 1.10462, and squared is about 1.22019, but that's not precise. Maybe I should use a calculator for this.\n\nAssuming I have a calculator, 1.01^20 is approximately 1.22019.\n\nWait, actually, I think I remember that 1.01 raised to the 20th power is about 1.22019.\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal amount:\n\n5000 * 1.22019 = 6100.95\n\nSo, after 5 years, the amount accumulated would be approximately $6,100.95.\n\nBut, I should check if I did everything correctly. Let me see:\n\n- P = $5,000\n\n- r = 4% = 0.04\n\n- n = 4 (since it's compounded quarterly)\n\n- t = 5 years\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5) = 5000(1 + 0.01)^20 = 5000(1.01)^20\n\nAs I calculated earlier, (1.01)^20 \u2248 1.22019\n\nSo, 5000 * 1.22019 = 6100.95\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently to confirm. Since the interest is compounded quarterly, each quarter the amount grows by 1%. So, over 5 years, that's 20 quarters.\n\nStarting with $5,000, each quarter you multiply the current amount by 1.01.\n\nSo, after 1 quarter: 5000 * 1.01 = 5050\n\nAfter 2 quarters: 5050 * 1.01 = 5100.50\n\nAfter 3 quarters: 5100.50 * 1.01 = 5151.51\n\nAnd so on, up to 20 quarters.\n\nBut that would take a while to calculate manually, so the formula is much easier.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the simple interest formula to see how it compares.\n\nSimple interest is A = P(1 + rt)\n\nSo, A = 5000(1 + 0.04*5) = 5000(1 + 0.2) = 5000*1.2 = 6000\n\nBut compound interest should yield more than simple interest, which it does ($6,100.95 > $6,000).\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the effective annual rate.\n\nThe effective annual rate (EAR) is (1 + r/n)^n - 1\n\nSo, EAR = (1 + 0.04/4)^4 - 1 = (1.01)^4 - 1 \u2248 1.0406 - 1 = 0.0406 or 4.06%\n\nSo, effectively, the investment grows at 4.06% per year.\n\nThen, over 5 years, the amount would be 5000*(1.0406)^5\n\nCalculating 1.0406^5 is approximately 1.2208\n\nSo, 5000*1.2208 = 6104\n\nWhich is close to what I calculated earlier ($6,100.95), considering rounding differences.\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the amount after 5 years is approximately $6,100.95.\n\nWait a second, in the first calculation, I got $6,100.95, and in the second method, I got $6,104. Is there a discrepancy here?\n\nLet me check my calculations more carefully.\n\nFirst method:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5) = 5000(1.01)^20\n\nCalculating (1.01)^20 more accurately:\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.01^20 \u2248 1.22019\n\nSo, 5000 * 1.22019 = 6100.95\n\nSecond method:\n\nEAR = (1 + 0.04/4)^4 - 1 = (1.01)^4 - 1 \u2248 1.040604 - 1 = 0.040604 or 4.0604%\n\nThen, A = 5000*(1.040604)^5\n\nCalculating 1.040604^5:\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.040604^5 \u2248 1.220802\n\nSo, 5000 * 1.220802 = 6104.01\n\nSo, the difference is due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps.\n\nTherefore, the final amount after 5 years is approximately $6,104.01\n\nSo, to conclude, if you invest $5,000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded quarterly, you will have approximately $6,104.01 after 5 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6104.01} \\]"
