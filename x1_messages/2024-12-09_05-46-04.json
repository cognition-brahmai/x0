        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: at a family gathering, everyone shakes hands with every other person exactly once, and there were a total of 66 handshakes. I need to figure out how many people attended the gathering.\n\nHmm, this seems like a classic problem in combinatorics. I think it has to do with combinations, where the order doesn't matter. In this case, a handshake between person A and person B is the same as a handshake between person B and person A, so it's unordered.\n\nI recall that the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n to shake hands is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nAnd I'm told that this equals 66:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, I need to solve for n in this equation.\n\nFirst, I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\nn(n-1) = 132\n\\]\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - n - 132 = 0\n\\]\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation for n. I can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to -1. Hmm, let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of 132:\n\n1 and 132\n\n2 and 66\n\n3 and 44\n\n4 and 33\n\n6 and 22\n\n11 and 12\n\nConsidering the signs, I need one positive and one negative to get -132. And their difference should be -1.\n\nLet's see, if I take 12 and -11:\n\n12 * -11 = -132\n\n12 + (-11) = 1, which is not -1.\n\nWait, maybe -12 and 11:\n\n-12 * 11 = -132\n\n-12 + 11 = -1, which is what I need.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - n - 132 = (n - 12)(n + 11) = 0\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives:\n\n\\[\nn - 12 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n + 11 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 12 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n = -11\n\\]\n\nSince the number of people can't be negative, n = 12 is the solution.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the formula for combinations is correct: C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nSetting that equal to 66 is correct.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives n(n-1) = 132.\n\nExpanding that gives n^2 - n - 132 = 0.\n\nFactoring that into (n - 12)(n + 11) = 0 is correct.\n\nAnd solving for n gives n = 12 or n = -11, but n can't be negative, so n = 12.\n\nLet me verify this by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nC(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 132/2 = 66, which matches the given number of handshakes.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have tried other methods, like using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor the equation n^2 - n - 132 = 0, a = 1, b = -1, c = -132.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 528}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{529}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm 23}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, n = (1 + 23)/2 = 24/2 = 12, or n = (1 - 23)/2 = -22/2 = -11.\n\nAgain, n = 12 is the valid solution.\n\nI could also have tried to list out the combinations, but that would be time-consuming for larger numbers.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the sequence of handshakes.\n\nThe first person shakes hands with n-1 people.\n\nThe second person shakes hands with n-2 remaining people (since they already shook hands with the first person).\n\nAnd so on, until the last person, who has already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is:\n\n\\[\n(n-1) + (n-2) + \\dots + 1 + 0\n\\]\n\nThis is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, which is equal to (n-1)n/2.\n\nWait, that's the same as C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, which matches what I started with.\n\nSo, again, confirming that the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't remember the combination formula, I can think of it as each person shaking hands with every other person exactly once, leading to this sum.\n\nAnother approach could be to use graph theory, where each person is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge.\n\nIn an undirected graph, the number of edges is equal to C(n, 2), which again brings me back to the same formula.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same equation.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who attended the gathering is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
