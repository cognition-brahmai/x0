        "content": "Yes, during the invasion of Poland in 1939, Polish cavalry did charge against German tanks with lances and sabers. This was due to a combination of factors, including outdated military tactics, lack of adequate armored support, and the surprise nature of the German attack.\n\nThe Polish cavalry, known as the \"Uhlans,\" were highly skilled horsemen who had traditionally fought with lances and sabers. However, by the time of World War II, cavalry charges against modern armored vehicles were obsolete and suicidal.\n\nThe misconception arises from the fact that the Polish cavalry did engage German infantry and armored vehicles in several instances, but these charges were not\u76f2\u76ee or irrational. Instead, they were often attempts to disrupt enemy formations or exploit specific tactical situations.\n\nOne famous example is the Battle of Krojanty on September 1, 1939, where a Polish cavalry brigade attacked German infantry positions, mistaking them for Polish units. When German armored vehicles intervened, the cavalry suffered heavy losses. This incident was later exaggerated and misreported, leading to the myth of Polish cavalry charging German tanks.\n\nIn reality, the Polish military was in the process of modernizing and had some armored units, but they were insufficient to counter the massive German armored forces. The Polish strategy relied on delaying actions and mobile defense, but the swift German advance overwhelmed many Polish units.\n\nIt's important to note that while some cavalry charges did occur, they were not the norm, and the Polish army also employed infantry, artillery, and aircraft in their defense. The myth of Polish cavalry charging tanks persists due to propaganda and misinformation spread by both German and Soviet sources during and after the war.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Zaloga, S.
