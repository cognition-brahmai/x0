        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells books for $12 each and magazines for $5 each. A customer wants to buy a combination of these items that totals exactly $100. We need to find out all the possible combinations of books and magazines that add up to $100.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of books.\n\n- Let \\( m \\) represent the number of magazines.\n\nGiven the prices, the total cost can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\[ 12b + 5m = 100 \\]\n\nOur goal is to find all non-negative integer solutions for \\( b \\) and \\( m \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\nSince \\( b \\) and \\( m \\) have to be whole numbers (you can't buy a fraction of a book or magazine), we're dealing with a Diophantine equation, which are equations that require integer solutions.\n\nLet's try to solve for one variable in terms of the other. I'll solve for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ 5m = 100 - 12b \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 12b}{5} \\]\n\nFor \\( m \\) to be an integer, the numerator \\( 100 - 12b \\) must be divisible by 5. Therefore, \\( 100 - 12b \\) must be a multiple of 5.\n\nLet's consider the possible values of \\( b \\) that make \\( 100 - 12b \\) divisible by 5.\n\nFirst, note that 100 is divisible by 5 (since 100 \u00f7 5 = 20), and 12 is not divisible by 5. So, we need to find \\( b \\) such that \\( 12b \\) leaves a remainder that, when subtracted from 100, results in a number divisible by 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for \\( b \\) such that \\( 12b \\) modulo 5 equals 100 modulo 5.\n\nCalculate 100 mod 5:\n\n\\[ 100 \\div 5 = 20 \\] with no remainder, so \\( 100 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\)\n\nNow, calculate 12 mod 5:\n\n\\[ 12 \\div 5 = 2 \\) with a remainder of 2, so \\( 12 \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( 12b \\equiv 2b \\mod 5 \\)\n\nWe need \\( 2b \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\), meaning \\( 2b \\) is divisible by 5.\n\nSo, \\( 2b \\) must be a multiple of 5.\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( 2b = 5k \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nThen, \\( b = \\frac{5k}{2} \\)\n\nBut \\( b \\) must be an integer, so \\( \\frac{5k}{2} \\) must be integer. This implies that \\( k \\) must be even.\n\nLet \\( k = 2n \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer.\n\nThen, \\( b = \\frac{5(2n)}{2} = 5n \\)\n\nSo, \\( b \\) must be a multiple of 5.\n\nNow, since \\( b \\) represents the number of books, it must be a non-negative integer (\\( b \\geq 0 \\)).\n\nLet's find the possible values of \\( b \\):\n\nGiven that \\( b = 5n \\), and \\( b \\) must satisfy the original equation, we need to ensure that \\( m \\) is also non-negative.\n\nSubstitute \\( b = 5n \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 12(5n)}{5} = \\frac{100 - 60n}{5} = 20 - 12n \\]\n\nSince \\( m \\) must be non-negative, \\( 20 - 12n \\geq 0 \\)\n\nSolve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ 20 - 12n \\geq 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 20 \\geq 12n \\]\n\n\\[ n \\leq \\frac{20}{12} \\]\n\n\\[ n \\leq \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) is an integer, the possible values for \\( n \\) are \\( n = 0, 1 \\)\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding values of \\( b \\) and \\( m \\) for each \\( n \\):\n\n1. For \\( n = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ b = 5(0) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 20 - 12(0) = 20 \\]\n\nSo, one combination is 0 books and 20 magazines.\n\n2. For \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ b = 5(1) = 5 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 20 - 12(1) = 8 \\]\n\nSo, another combination is 5 books and 8 magazines.\n\nLet's check if these combinations indeed total $100:\n\n1. 0 books and 20 magazines:\n\n\\[ 12(0) + 5(20) = 0 + 100 = 100 \\]\n\n2. 5 books and 8 magazines:\n\n\\[ 12(5) + 5(8) = 60 + 40 = 100 \\]\n\nBoth combinations satisfy the total of $100.\n\nAre there any other possible values for \\( n \\)?\n\nWell, \\( n \\) can be negative, but since \\( b = 5n \\) and \\( b \\) must be non-negative, \\( n \\) cannot be negative. Therefore, the only possible integer values for \\( n \\) are 0 and 1.\n\nHence, there are only two possible combinations:\n\n- 0 books and 20 magazines\n\n- 5 books and 8 magazines\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check if there are any other possible solutions that we might have missed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another approach to solve this problem.\n\nLet's try iterating through possible values of \\( b \\) and see if \\( m \\) comes out to be an integer.\n\nGiven the equation:\n\n\\[ 12b + 5m = 100 \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 12b}{5} \\]\n\nFor \\( m \\) to be an integer, \\( 100 - 12b \\) must be divisible by 5.\n\nLet's try different non-negative integer values for \\( b \\) and see which ones satisfy this condition.\n\nPossible values for \\( b \\):\n\nSince each book costs $12, the maximum number of books the customer can buy is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{12} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\) books.\n\nSo, \\( b \\) can be from 0 to 8.\n\nNow, let's check each value of \\( b \\) from 0 to 8:\n\n1. \\( b = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 0}{5} = 20 \\] (integer)\n\n2. \\( b = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 12}{5} = \\frac{88}{5} = 17.6 \\] (not integer)\n\n3. \\( b = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 24}{5} = \\frac{76}{5} = 15.2 \\] (not integer)\n\n4. \\( b = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 36}{5} = \\frac{64}{5} = 12.8 \\] (not integer)\n\n5. \\( b = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 48}{5} = \\frac{52}{5} = 10.4 \\] (not integer)\n\n6. \\( b = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 60}{5} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8 \\] (integer)\n\n7. \\( b = 6 \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 72}{5} = \\frac{28}{5} = 5.6 \\] (not integer)\n\n8. \\( b = 7 \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 84}{5} = \\frac{16}{5} = 3.2 \\] (not integer)\n\n9. \\( b = 8 \\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{100 - 96}{5} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \\] (not integer)\n\nSo, only \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( b = 5 \\) give integer values for \\( m \\), which matches our earlier findings.\n\nTherefore, the only possible combinations are:\n\n- 0 books and 20 magazines\n\n- 5 books and 8 magazines\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this problem.\n\nPerhaps using the concept of linear combinations or greatest common divisors (GCD).\n\nThe GCD of 12 and 5 is 1, which divides 100. Since 1 divides 100, there are solutions to the equation.\n\nThe general solution to the equation \\( 12b + 5m = 100 \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ b = b_0 + 5k \\]\n\n\\[ m = m_0 - 12k \\]\n\nWhere \\( b_0 \\) and \\( m_0 \\) are particular solutions, and \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nFrom earlier, we have two particular solutions:\n\n1. \\( b = 0 \\), \\( m = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( b = 5 \\), \\( m = 8 \\)\n\nLet's use the first particular solution \\( b = 0 \\), \\( m = 20 \\):\n\nThen, the general solution is:\n\n\\[ b = 0 + 5k = 5k \\]\n\n\\[ m = 20 - 12k \\]\n\nWe need both \\( b \\) and \\( m \\) to be non-negative integers.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 5k \\geq 0 \\] \u21d2 \\( k \\geq 0 \\)\n\n\\[ 20 - 12k \\geq 0 \\] \u21d2 \\( k \\leq \\frac{20}{12} \\) \u21d2 \\( k \\leq \\frac{5}{3} \\) \u21d2 \\( k \\leq 1 \\) (since \\( k \\) is an integer)\n\nTherefore, \\( k \\) can be 0 or 1.\n\nFor \\( k = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ b = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 20 \\]\n\nFor \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ b = 5 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 8 \\]\n\nWhich again confirms our earlier solutions.\n\nTherefore, there are only two possible combinations.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach to confirm this.\n\nPerhaps graphically, by plotting the equation \\( 12b + 5m = 100 \\) and looking for integer solutions where both \\( b \\) and \\( m \\) are non-negative integers.\n\nHowever, since this is a linear equation in two variables, the graph would be a straight line, and the integer solutions would be the lattice points that lie on that line within the first quadrant.\n\nGiven the constraints, and as we've already found only two such points, it's consistent with our previous conclusions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using modular arithmetic to find all possible solutions.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[ 12b + 5m \\equiv 0 \\mod 100 \\]\n\nBut since the total is exactly 100, it's better to stick with the original equation.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that \\( m \\) must be a multiple of 12 minus some multiple of 5 to reach 100.\n\nBut I think we've sufficiently explored different methods and all point to the same two solutions.\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. 0 books and 20 magazines\n\n2. 5 books and 8 magazines\n\nI don't see any other combinations that satisfy the condition of totaling exactly $100.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if negative values are possible, but since you can't buy negative quantities, \\( b \\) and \\( m \\) must be non-negative integers, so no need to consider negative values.\n\nAlso, zero is allowed for either \\( b \\) or \\( m \\), as long as the total is $100.\n\nHence, the final answer is these two combinations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(0, 20) \\text{ and } (5, 8)} \\]"
