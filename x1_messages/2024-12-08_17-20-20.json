        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units of product X in 8 hours. If it operates for 12 hours a day, how many units can it produce in one day? Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the production rate per hour. So, if 500 units are produced in 8 hours, then the hourly production rate would be 500 units divided by 8 hours. That should give me the number of units produced per hour.\n\nLet me calculate that: 500 divided by 8 is 62.5 units per hour. So, the factory produces 62.5 units each hour.\n\nNow, if the factory operates for 12 hours a day, I can find the total daily production by multiplying the hourly production rate by the number of hours operated in a day.\n\nSo, that would be 62.5 units per hour times 12 hours. Let's do the math: 62.5 times 12.\n\nWell, 60 times 12 is 720, and 2.5 times 12 is 30, so adding them up, 720 plus 30 equals 750 units.\n\nTherefore, the factory can produce 750 units of product X in one day if it operates for 12 hours.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to find out how much longer the factory is operating beyond the initial 8 hours and then find out how much more it can produce in that extra time.\n\nSo, the factory is operating for 12 hours, which is 4 hours more than the initial 8 hours.\n\nIf it produces 500 units in 8 hours, then in 4 hours, it should produce half of that, since 4 is half of 8.\n\nHalf of 500 is 250 units.\n\nSo, in 12 hours, it would produce 500 units plus an additional 250 units, totaling 750 units.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 750 units is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion. If 8 hours correspond to 500 units, then 12 hours correspond to x units.\n\nSo, 8/500 = 12/x or vice versa. Wait, actually, it should be 8 hours is to 500 units as 12 hours is to x units.\n\nSo, 8/500 = 12/x.\n\nWait, no. Proportions are set up as ratios of the same quantities.\n\nSo, hours to units should be consistent.\n\nActually, it's better to think of it as units per hour.\n\nSo, 500 units / 8 hours = x units / 12 hours.\n\nSo, 500/8 = x/12.\n\nThen, solving for x, x = (500/8) * 12.\n\nThat's the same as my first calculation.\n\nSo, again, x = (500 * 12) / 8.\n\nLet's compute that: 500 times 12 is 6000, divided by 8 is 750 units.\n\nSame answer again. So, definitely, the factory can produce 750 units in one day when operating for 12 hours.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this.\n\nIs there any information about the factory's production rate changing over time, or any constraints like machine downtime, breaks, or anything like that?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any such factors, so I'll assume that the production rate is constant throughout the 12 hours.\n\nTherefore, the calculation remains straightforward: calculate the hourly production rate and then multiply by the total operating hours in a day.\n\nSo, the final answer is 750 units per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{750} \\]"
