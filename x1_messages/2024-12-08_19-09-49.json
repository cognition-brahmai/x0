        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 5 boxes, and each of these boxes contains 4 smaller boxes, and each of those smaller boxes contains 3 tiny boxes. I need to find out how many tiny boxes there are in total. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 5 big boxes. Each of these big boxes contains 4 smaller boxes. So, if I have 5 big boxes, and each has 4 smaller boxes, then the total number of smaller boxes is 5 times 4, which is 20 smaller boxes.\n\nNow, each of these 20 smaller boxes contains 3 tiny boxes. So, if I have 20 smaller boxes, and each has 3 tiny boxes, then the total number of tiny boxes is 20 times 3, which is 60 tiny boxes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's think about the structure here:\n\n- There are 5 big boxes.\n\n- Each big box has 4 smaller boxes inside it.\n\n- Each smaller box has 3 tiny boxes inside it.\n\nSo, the tiny boxes are nested two levels deep: inside the smaller boxes, which are inside the big boxes.\n\nTo find the total number of tiny boxes, I need to consider all the levels.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the multiplication at each level.\n\nStart with the big boxes: 5 big boxes.\n\nEach big box contains 4 smaller boxes, so the total number of smaller boxes is 5 * 4 = 20.\n\nNow, each of these 20 smaller boxes contains 3 tiny boxes, so the total number of tiny boxes is 20 * 3 = 60.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a multiplication of all the levels together: 5 big boxes, each with 4 smaller boxes, each with 3 tiny boxes, so 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nMaybe I can think about one big box: it has 4 smaller boxes, and each smaller box has 3 tiny boxes, so one big box has 4 * 3 = 12 tiny boxes.\n\nSince there are 5 big boxes, each containing 12 tiny boxes, the total number of tiny boxes is 5 * 12 = 60.\n\nAlright, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nLet me try another angle. Suppose I consider all the tiny boxes individually.\n\nEach tiny box is inside a smaller box, which is inside a big box.\n\nSo, for each tiny box, there's a path: big box -> smaller box -> tiny box.\n\nGiven that, the number of tiny boxes should be the product of the number of choices at each level.\n\nNumber of big boxes: 5\n\nNumber of smaller boxes per big box: 4\n\nNumber of tiny boxes per smaller box: 3\n\nTotal tiny boxes: 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nImagine there are 5 large boxes.\n\nEach large box contains 4 medium-sized boxes.\n\nAnd each medium-sized box contains 3 small tiny boxes.\n\nSo, for example, big box 1 has smaller boxes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4.\n\nEach of these smaller boxes has tiny boxes a, b, c.\n\nSo, smaller box 1.1 has tiny boxes a, b, c.\n\nSmaller box 1.2 has tiny boxes a, b, c.\n\nAnd so on for all the smaller boxes in all the big boxes.\n\nSo, for big box 1:\n\nSmaller boxes: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4\n\nEach has 3 tiny boxes: a, b, c.\n\nSo, for big box 1, number of tiny boxes is 4 smaller boxes * 3 tiny boxes = 12.\n\nSimilarly, for big box 2: another 12 tiny boxes.\n\nAnd so on up to big box 5.\n\nSo, total tiny boxes are 5 big boxes * 12 tiny boxes per big box = 60.\n\nYes, that seems to check out.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of overlapping or double-counting.\n\nEach tiny box is uniquely contained within one smaller box, which is itself contained within one big box.\n\nSo, no overlaps or shared boxes between different big boxes or smaller boxes.\n\nTherefore, the total should indeed be the product of the numbers at each level.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider it as a tree structure.\n\nThe big boxes are the root nodes.\n\nEach big box has 4 child nodes, which are the smaller boxes.\n\nEach smaller box has 3 child nodes, which are the tiny boxes.\n\nSo, the total number of tiny boxes is the total number of leaf nodes in this tree.\n\nGiven that, the total number of leaf nodes would be the number of big boxes multiplied by the number of smaller boxes per big box multiplied by the number of tiny boxes per smaller box, which is again 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of tiny boxes is 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
