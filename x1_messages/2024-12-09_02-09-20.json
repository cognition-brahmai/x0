Haikus are traditionally composed of three phrases with a syllable pattern of 5-7-5. They often capture a moment in nature or a seasonal change. Here are some examples inspired by various natural phenomena:\n\n**Spring Blossoms**\n\nCherry petals fall soft,  \nSpring's gentle breeze whispers through,  \nNature awakens.\n\n**Summer Storm**\n\nThunder rolls above,  \nRain dances on green leaves below,  \nSummer's passionate.\n\n**Autumn Leaves**\n\nGolden leaves descend,  \nCrimson and amber paint the sky,  \nAutumn's quiet hymn.\n\n**Winter Snow**\n\nSilent snowflakes drift,  \nBlanketing the world in white,  \nWinter's hush descends.\n\n**Mountain Majesty**\n\nPeaks touch the sky high,  \nEagles soar where clouds dare not,  \nMountain's stern embrace.\n\n**Ocean's Embrace**\n\nWaves caress the shore,  \nEndless blue meets horizon,  \nOcean's eternal song.\n\n**Desert Solitude**\n\nSand dunes stretch afar,  \nSun paints the sky in oranges,  \nDesert's silent chant.\n\n**Forest Whispers**\n\nAncient trees stand tall,  \nMystic light filters through leaves,  \nForest's secret tales.\n\n**River's Journey**\n\nWater flows serene,  \nCarving paths through time and stone,  \nRiver's endless quest.\n\n**Sunrise Serenity**\n\nGolden sun ascends,  \nPainting skies with hues of dawn,  \nNew day's promise blooms.\n\nI hope these haikus capture the essence of nature's beauty and inspire a sense of wonder and appreciation for our natural world."
