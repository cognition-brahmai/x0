        "content": "So I've got this math problem here: (4 * 3) / (2^3 - 5) + 6. Hmm, let's break it down step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the stuff inside the parentheses. There are two sets: the numerator (4 * 3) and the denominator (2^3 - 5).\n\nStarting with the numerator: 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. So, that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the denominator: 2 raised to the power of 3 minus 5. Exponents come before subtraction, right? So, 2^3 is 8. Then, 8 minus 5 is 3.\n\nSo now, the expression simplifies to 12 divided by 3 plus 6.\n\nNext, division before addition. 12 divided by 3 is 4. Then, 4 plus 6 is 10.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n(4 * 3) / (2^3 - 5) + 6\n\n= 12 / (8 - 5) + 6\n\n= 12 / 3 + 6\n\n= 4 + 6\n\n= 10\n\nSeems pretty straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other ways to interpret this.\n\nPerhaps if the exponent applies differently, but no, 2^3 is definitely 8.\n\nAnd the order of operations is correct: parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nSo, in this case, parentheses are handled, exponent is calculated, multiplication and division are done next, and finally addition.\n\nI think 10 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
