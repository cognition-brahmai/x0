        "content": "In the velvet expanse of night's embrace,\nWhere stars whisper secrets to the moon's soft face,\nA canvas painted with hues so fine,\nIn shades of blue and silver shine.\n\nThe world below sleeps, cradled in repose,\nWhile overhead, a thousand stories disclose.\nEach star a dream, each twinkle a sigh,\nIn the silent dance of the cosmos on high.\n\nNo constellations guide my Muse this night,\nNo Orion's belt, no Pleiades' light.\nJust the raw, unbridled beauty of space,\nWhere mysteries hide in every place.\n\nThe Milky Way, a river of light,\nSpills across the heavens, pure and bright.\nBut I won't name it, for in this verse,\nIt's simply the path where dreams rehearse.\n\nThe moon, a pearl in the sky's dark sea,\nIts glow upon the earth, a gentle spree.\nYet, I refrain from calling it by name,\nLet it be the lantern of the night's game.\n\nShadows lengthen, and the wind does sigh,\nAs if in awe of the celestial sky.\nThe world holds its breath, in reverence deep,\nTo the wonders that only night can keep.\n\nSo here I stand, beneath the starry dome,\nA mere speck in the universe's home.\nAnd though I know not the names of the lights above,\nTheir beauty speaks, in a language of love.\n\nFor in the night sky, where mysteries abound,\nLies a peace that the day cannot astound.\nIt's a reminder of our place in the vast,\nAnd the infinite stories that are at last.\n\nUnspoken, unnamed, yet deeply felt,\nThe night sky's magic, foreverbelt.\nSo let me bask in its serene glow,\nAnd let my soul with its beauty grow.\n\nFor in the darkness, where the stars do play,\nLies a beauty that words can barely convey.\nSo I'll keep silent on their names and ways,\nAnd let their mystery forever amaze."
