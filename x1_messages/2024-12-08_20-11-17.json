I've been meaning to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately, and I think it's best if I put it down in words so you can understand where I'm coming from.\n\nAs you know, I've been coming home later than usual these past few weeks. I've tried to be as discreet as possible, but I realize that my late nights might be causing you worry. For that, I'm truly sorry. You've always been there for me, supporting me in every way possible, and the least I can do is keep you informed and at ease.\n\nThe truth is, being a student and balancing schoolwork is challenging enough, but lately, I've taken up some additional responsibilities that require a significant amount of my time. I've joined a few clubs and organizations at school that align with my interests, and they've been quite demanding. There are meetings, projects, and events that need my attention, and sometimes, they run late into the evening.\n\nMoreover, I've also been volunteering at the local community center. It's a place where I can give back to the community and help those in need. The volunteer shifts are in the evenings, and I've been trying to make as much time as possible to be there and assist wherever I can.\n\nI understand that you might be concerned about my safety and well-being, and I assure you that I'm being cautious and taking all necessary precautions. I always let someone know where I am, and I try to stick to well-lit and populated areas when walking home.\n\nI want you to know that I appreciate everything you do for me. Your love and support mean the world to me, and I promise to be more communicative about my schedule going forward. If there's ever anything on my mind or if I need to talk, I'll make sure to reach out to you.\n\nThank you for understanding, Aunt May. I love you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPeter\n\nP.S. I've attached my updated schedule so you can see when I'll be busy and plan accordingly.\n\n**[Attached: Peter's Updated Schedule]**"
