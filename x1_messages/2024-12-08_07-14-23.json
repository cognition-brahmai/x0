        "content": "Yes, nicotine can stay in your body for several months, depending on various factors such as the frequency and amount of usage, individual metabolism, and the specific detection method being used. Nicotine is metabolized into cotinine, which has a longer half-life and can be detected in the body for a more extended period. It's essential to note that the detection time can vary from person to person, and factors such as age, weight, and overall health can influence how long nicotine remains in the system."
