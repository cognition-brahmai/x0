Below is a PowerShell script that retrieves information about all running processes on the local computer, including Process ID, Process Name, CPU Usage, Memory Usage, and Start Time. It then displays this information in a tabular format.\n\n```powershell\n# Get all running processes\n$processes = Get-Process\n\n# Select specific properties and calculate CPU usage\n$processInfo = foreach ($process in $processes) {\n    [PSCustomObject]@{\n        ProcessID = $process.Id\n        ProcessName = $process.ProcessName\n        CPUUsage = \"$([math]::Round($process.CPU, 2))%\"\n        MemoryUsage = \"{0:N2} MB\" -f ($process.WorkingSet / 1MB)\n        StartTime = $process.StartTime\n    }\n}\n\n# Display the information in a table\n$processInfo | Sort-Object -Property CPUUsage -Descending | Format-Table -AutoSize\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Get-Process**: This cmdlet retrieves all running processes on the local computer.\n2. **foreach loop**: Iterates through each process to extract and calculate the required information.\n3. **PSCustomObject**: Creates custom objects with properties for ProcessID, ProcessName, CPUUsage, MemoryUsage, and StartTime.\n4. **CPUUsage**: Calculated and formatted as a percentage.\n5. **MemoryUsage**: Calculated and formatted in megabytes (MB).\n6. **Sort-Object**: Sorts the processes by CPU usage in descending order.\n7. **Format-Table -AutoSize**: Displays the information in a table format with automatic column sizing.\n\nThis script provides a clear overview of running processes, sorted by CPU usage, making it easier to identify resource-intensive processes."
