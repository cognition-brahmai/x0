        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"If the sum of three consecutive even integers is 90, what are the integers?\" Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that even integers are numbers like 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. They're always 2 units apart. So, if I have three consecutive even integers, they would be like x, x+2, and x+4, where x is the first even integer.\n\nNow, the problem says that the sum of these three integers is 90. So, I can set up an equation to represent this situation. The sum would be:\n\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 90\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nx + x + 2 + x + 4 = 90\n\nNow, I can combine like terms. Adding up the x's and the constants separately:\n\nx + x + x is 3x, and 2 + 4 is 6. So, the equation simplifies to:\n\n3x + 6 = 90\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for x. First, I'll subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:\n\n3x + 6 - 6 = 90 - 6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3x = 84\n\nNow, I'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\n3x / 3 = 84 / 3\n\nSo, x = 28\n\nNow that I have x, which is the first even integer, I can find the other two by adding 2 and 4 to it, respectively.\n\nSo, the three consecutive even integers are:\n\nFirst integer: x = 28\n\nSecond integer: x + 2 = 30\n\nThird integer: x + 4 = 32\n\nLet me double-check to make sure that these are indeed even and consecutive. 28, 30, 32\u2014yes, they're all even, and each is 2 more than the previous one.\n\nNow, to verify that their sum is indeed 90:\n\n28 + 30 + 32 = 90\n\nLet's add them up: 28 + 30 is 58, and 58 + 32 is 90. Perfect, it checks out.\n\nSo, the three consecutive even integers are 28, 30, and 32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28, 30, 32} \\]"
