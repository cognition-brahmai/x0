        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have 10 apples, and I eat 2 apples every day until I run out. The question is, how many days will the apples last?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems straightforward: I've got a certain number of apples, I consume them at a steady rate, and I want to find out how many days this supply will last.\n\nSo, the total number of apples is 10, and the daily consumption is 2 apples per day. To find out how many days the apples will last, I should divide the total number of apples by the number of apples I eat each day.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal apples = 10\n\nApples eaten per day = 2\n\nNumber of days = Total apples / Apples eaten per day = 10 / 2 = 5 days\n\nThat seems simple enough. But maybe there's more to it. What if I don't always eat exactly 2 apples every day? Maybe some days I eat a bit more or less. But the problem says I eat 2 apples every day until I run out, so I think it's safe to assume a constant rate of consumption.\n\nWait a minute, what if on the last day, I don't have exactly 2 apples left? For example, if I have only 1 apple left on the fifth day, will I still eat 2 apples? But according to the problem, I eat 2 apples every day until I run out. So, if I have only 1 apple left, I can't eat 2 apples that day, which means I run out before completing the fifth day.\n\nLet me think about that again. Starting with 10 apples:\n\nDay 1: Eat 2 apples, remaining = 10 - 2 = 8\n\nDay 2: Eat 2 apples, remaining = 8 - 2 = 6\n\nDay 3: Eat 2 apples, remaining = 6 - 2 = 4\n\nDay 4: Eat 2 apples, remaining = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nDay 5: Eat 2 apples, remaining = 2 - 2 = 0\n\nSo, on day 5, I eat the last 2 apples, and there are no apples left. Therefore, the apples last for 5 full days.\n\nBut what if on day 5, there are only 1 apple left? According to the problem, I eat 2 apples every day until I run out. So, if I have only 1 apple left, I can't eat 2 apples, which means that on day 5, I can't eat 2 apples, and thus, I run out before day 5 is over.\n\nWait, but in the calculation above, on day 5, I have exactly 2 apples left, which allows me to eat 2 apples, leaving me with 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the apples will last exactly 5 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that on the last day, if I have less than 2 apples, I won't eat any apples that day, because I can't eat 2 apples. But that seems a bit picky. Maybe I should adjust my approach.\n\nLet me try a different method. If I eat 2 apples per day, then the number of full days I can continue eating is the integer part of the total apples divided by the daily consumption.\n\nSo, 10 divided by 2 is 5, which is a whole number, meaning I can eat 2 apples each day for 5 days, with no apples left over.\n\nBut what if I had, say, 11 apples? Then, 11 divided by 2 is 5.5. But since I can't have half a day, I would say it lasts for 5 full days, and on the sixth day, I have 1 apple left, which is not enough to eat 2 apples.\n\nWait, but in this case, with 10 apples, since 10 divided by 2 is exactly 5, I can have 5 full days with no apples left afterward.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 5 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of inequalities. Let\u2019s let d be the number of days the apples last.\n\nEach day, I eat 2 apples, so after d days, I would have eaten 2d apples.\n\nI start with 10 apples, so the inequality is:\n\n2d \u2264 10\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd \u2264 10 / 2\n\nd \u2264 5\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of full days I can eat 2 apples is 5 days.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nWhat if I consider that on the last day, I might eat fewer than 2 apples if I don't have enough? But the problem says I eat 2 apples every day until I run out. So, I stop eating once I can't eat 2 apples.\n\nSo, in that case, I can only eat 2 apples per day for 5 days, and on day 6, I would have 0 apples, which isn't enough to eat another 2 apples, so I stop.\n\nTherefore, the apples last for 5 days.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see how many sets of 2 apples are there in 10 apples.\n\n10 divided by 2 is 5, so there are 5 sets of 2 apples in 10 apples.\n\nTherefore, the apples will last for 5 days.\n\nI think this is the most straightforward and accurate way to approach the problem.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the apples will last for 5 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
