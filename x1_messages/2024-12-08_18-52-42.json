I know that honey bees are important for pollinating many crops, but I don't think that all of our food depends on them. There are other pollinators like bumblebees, butterflies, and even some birds and bats that help with pollination. Also, some crops are wind-pollinated or self-pollinating, so they don't need insects to help them. So, I doubt that humanity would starve or die out without European honey bees. But maybe I'm missing something. What do you think?"
