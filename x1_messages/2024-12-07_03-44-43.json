        "content": "Yes, generally speaking, overweight or obese individuals tend to have higher resting metabolic rates (RMR) than normal-weight individuals due to their larger body size and higher fat mass. However, it's essential to note that this doesn't necessarily mean that overweight people burn calories more efficiently.\n\nResting metabolic rate refers to the number of calories your body burns while at rest to maintain vital functions such as breathing, circulation, and temperature regulation. Several factors influence RMR, including age, sex, muscle mass, and overall body composition.\n\nIn terms of body composition, muscle tissue is more metabolically active than fat tissue, meaning that muscle burns more calories at rest compared to fat. Therefore, individuals with higher muscle mass tend to have higher RMRs, regardless of their weight.\n\nOverweight or obese individuals often have higher fat mass, which can lead to a higher RMR compared to normal-weight individuals with lower fat mass. However, the increase in RMR may not be proportionate to the increase in body weight, resulting in a lower metabolic rate per unit of body mass.\n\nMoreover, some studies suggest that obesity may be associated with a lower metabolic rate per unit of fat-free mass compared to normal-weight individuals. This could be due to various factors, including hormonal imbalances, inflammation, or other metabolic alterations associated with obesity.\n\nIt's important to consider that resting metabolic rate is just one aspect of overall energy expenditure. Other factors, such as physical activity level and the thermic effect of food, also contribute to total daily energy expenditure.\n\nIn summary, while overweight individuals may have higher absolute resting metabolic rates due to their larger body size, their metabolic rate per unit of body mass may be lower compared to normal-weight individuals. Additionally, factors such as muscle mass and overall body composition play significant roles in determining metabolic rates.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1.
