        "content": "Let's see. The store sells three types of candies: X, Y, and Z, priced at $5, $8, and $12 per pound respectively. The customer bought 3 pounds of type X, 4 pounds of type Y, and 2 pounds of type Z. I need to find out the total cost of this purchase.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost for each type of candy separately and then add them up to get the total cost.\n\nStarting with type X:\n\nType X costs $5 per pound, and the customer bought 3 pounds.\n\nSo, the cost for type X is 3 pounds * $5/pound = $15.\n\nNext, type Y:\n\nType Y is $8 per pound, and the customer bought 4 pounds.\n\nSo, the cost for type Y is 4 pounds * $8/pound = $32.\n\nThen, type Z:\n\nType Z is $12 per pound, and the customer bought 2 pounds.\n\nSo, the cost for type Z is 2 pounds * $12/pound = $24.\n\nNow, I need to add up these amounts to get the total cost:\n\n$15 (for X) + $32 (for Y) + $24 (for Z) = $15 + $32 = $47, and then $47 + $24 = $71.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the purchase is $71.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nType X: 3 pounds * $5/pound = $15. That seems correct.\n\nType Y: 4 pounds * $8/pound = $32. That also seems correct.\n\nType Z: 2 pounds * $12/pound = $24. Correct.\n\nTotal: $15 + $32 + $24.\n\nAdding $15 and $32 gives $47.\n\nThen adding $47 and $24 should be $71.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the total weight or something, but since each type has a different price, it's proper to calculate each one separately and then sum them up.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here or additional factors to consider, like tax or anything. The question seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the total cost should be $71.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{71} \\]"
