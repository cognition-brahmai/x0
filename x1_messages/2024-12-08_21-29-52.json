        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangle with a length of 12 units and a width of 8 units. So, first things first, I need to find out the area of this rectangle before any cuts are made.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, for this rectangle:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 12 units \u00d7 8 units = 96 square units.\n\nAlright, so we start with 96 square units.\n\nNow, the problem says to cut out a square from one corner of the rectangle. The side length of this square is equal to half the width of the rectangle. The width of the rectangle is 8 units, so half of that would be:\n\nSide length of square = 8 units / 2 = 4 units.\n\nSo, we're cutting out a square with sides of 4 units.\n\nNext, I need to find the area of this square to see how much area is being removed from the rectangle.\n\nArea of square = side \u00d7 side = 4 units \u00d7 4 units = 16 square units.\n\nNow, to find the area of the remaining shape, I need to subtract the area of the square from the area of the original rectangle.\n\nRemaining area = area of rectangle - area of square = 96 square units - 16 square units = 80 square units.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let me double-check. The rectangle is 12 units long and 8 units wide, and I'm cutting out a square of 4 units from one corner. Yes, that should leave a shape that's still a quadrilateral but with one corner cut off.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the remaining shape could be seen as a combination of a smaller rectangle and a rectangle with a portion missing. But in this case, since we're just cutting out a square from one corner, the simplest way is just to subtract the area of the square from the area of the rectangle.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I draw a rectangle that's 12 units by 8 units and then cut out a square of 4 units from one corner, what's left is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square.\n\nSo, yes, the calculation seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining shape is 80 square units.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the new dimensions after the cut.\n\nIf I cut out a square of 4 units from one corner, the remaining shape would have new dimensions. Let's see:\n\nThe original rectangle is 12 units long and 8 units wide. Cutting a square of 4 units from one corner would reduce both the length and the width by 4 units, but only partially, since it's just one corner.\n\nActually, after cutting out the square, the remaining shape would consist of two rectangles: one that's 12 units by (8 - 4) = 12 units by 4 units, and another that's (12 - 4) = 8 units by 4 units, but that might be double-counting.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider the area removed is just the square of 4 units by 4 units, which is 16 square units, and subtract that from the total area of 96 square units, which gives 80 square units, as I initially calculated.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the area of the remaining shape directly. If I remove a square from one corner, the remaining shape is a pentagon. To find its area, I could divide it into smaller shapes whose areas I can calculate and then sum them up.\n\nFor example, I could divide the remaining shape into one rectangle and one right-angled triangle.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nAfter cutting out the square, the remaining shape can be divided into a rectangle that's 12 units by (8 - 4) = 12 units by 4 units, and a right-angled triangle with legs of 4 units each (from the cut-out square).\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Actually, after cutting out the square, the remaining shape is like the original rectangle with a square chunk missing from one corner.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the remaining shape as the original rectangle minus the square that was cut out.\n\nSo, area = area of rectangle - area of square = 96 - 16 = 80 square units.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the area of the remaining shape by considering it as a combination of smaller rectangles, I might get the same result.\n\nFor instance, if I consider the remaining shape as a rectangle of 12 units by 4 units (the uncut part) plus a rectangle of 8 units by 4 units (the part where the square was cut out), but that would be adding areas that aren't actually present.\n\nWait, no. Actually, that approach wouldn't make sense because the square cut out is a part that needs to be subtracted, not added.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach seems best.\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining shape is 80 square units.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider the coordinates.\n\nLet's place the rectangle on a coordinate plane with one corner at the origin (0,0). So, the rectangle extends from (0,0) to (12,8).\n\nIf we cut out a square from the corner at (8,0) with side length 4 units, then the square would extend from (8,0) to (12,4).\n\nSo, the area of the remaining shape would be the area of the rectangle minus the area of this square.\n\nArea of rectangle: 12 \u00d7 8 = 96 square units.\n\nArea of square: 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 square units.\n\nRemaining area: 96 - 16 = 80 square units.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the area of the remaining shape by integrating over the region, but that's unnecessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the remaining shape as consisting of two rectangles: one that's 12 units by 4 units (from y=4 to y=8) and another that's 8 units by 4 units (from x=0 to x=8 and y=0 to y=4), but then I would be double-counting or missing the cut-out square.\n\nWait, no. If I have a rectangle of 12 units by 4 units (from y=4 to y=8) and a rectangle of 8 units by 4 units (from x=0 to x=8 and y=0 to y=4), and then subtract the overlapping area, which is the cut-out square.\n\nBut that seems more complicated than necessary.\n\nStick with the initial approach: area of original rectangle minus area of cut-out square.\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining shape is 80 square units.\n\nI think that's the simplest and most accurate way to solve this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
