        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a hotel chain wanting to build a new resort on a tropical island. They're planning to have 200 rooms, each costing $250,000 to construct. Plus, there are additional facilities like a restaurant, spa, swimming pool, and conference center, with their own construction costs. I need to calculate the total construction cost and then estimate how long it will take to recoup this investment based on some given revenue figures.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the construction cost. The rooms are straightforward: 200 rooms at $250,000 each. So, the total cost for rooms is 200 multiplied by $250,000. Let me do that calculation:\n\n200 rooms * $250,000 per room = $50,000,000.\n\nNow, the additional facilities:\n\n- Restaurant: $1,000,000\n\n- Spa: $500,000\n\n- Swimming pool: $750,000\n\n- Conference center: $2,000,000\n\nLet's add these up:\n\n$1,000,000 + $500,000 + $750,000 + $2,000,000 = $4,250,000.\n\nNow, to get the total construction cost, I'll add the cost of the rooms and the additional facilities:\n\n$50,000,000 (rooms) + $4,250,000 (facilities) = $54,250,000.\n\nOkay, so the total construction cost is $54,250,000.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the time required to recoup this investment. To do that, I need to calculate the annual revenue and then see how many years it will take for the revenue to equal the construction cost.\n\nThe given data is:\n\n- Average room rate: $300 per night\n\n- Occupancy rate: 75%\n\n- Additional revenue from other facilities: 25% of total income\n\nFirst, let's find out the annual revenue from room bookings.\n\nThere are 200 rooms, each generating revenue based on the occupancy rate and the room rate.\n\nDaily revenue from rooms = Number of rooms * Occupancy rate * Room rate\n\nSo,\n\nDaily revenue from rooms = 200 rooms * 75% * $300\n\nFirst, 75% of 200 rooms is 150 rooms occupied per night.\n\nSo,\n\n150 rooms * $300 per night = $45,000 per night.\n\nNow, to find annual revenue from rooms, we'll multiply the daily revenue by the number of nights in a year, which is 365.\n\nAnnual revenue from rooms = $45,000 per night * 365 nights = $16,425,000.\n\nNow, there's additional revenue from other facilities amounting to 25% of total income. Wait a minute, this is a bit tricky. It says \"additional revenue from other facilities amounting to 25% of total income.\"\n\nSo, total income seems to be the sum of room revenue and additional facility revenue. But it says additional revenue is 25% of total income, which includes both room revenue and additional revenue. This sounds like a circular dependency.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet R be the room revenue.\n\nLet F be the additional facility revenue.\n\nTotal income, T = R + F.\n\nBut F = 25% of T.\n\nSo, F = 0.25 * T.\n\nAnd T = R + F.\n\nSubstituting F in the equation:\n\nT = R + 0.25*T.\n\nNow, let's solve for T.\n\nT - 0.25*T = R.\n\n0.75*T = R.\n\nTherefore, T = R / 0.75.\n\nSo, total income T is room revenue divided by 0.75.\n\nWe already calculated R, the room revenue, as $16,425,000.\n\nSo, T = $16,425,000 / 0.75 = $21,900,000.\n\nTherefore, the total annual revenue is $21,900,000.\n\nNow, to find the payback period, which is the time required to recoup the construction cost, we'll divide the total construction cost by the annual revenue.\n\nPayback period = Total construction cost / Annual revenue.\n\nSo,\n\nPayback period = $54,250,000 / $21,900,000 \u2248 2.477 years.\n\nTo express this in years and months, 0.477 years is approximately 5.7 months.\n\nSo, it would take about 2 years and 6 months to recoup the investment.\n\nWait a second, does this seem reasonable? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the total construction cost:\n\n200 rooms * $250,000 = $50,000,000.\n\nAdditional facilities: $1,000,000 + $500,000 + $750,000 + $2,000,000 = $4,250,000.\n\nTotal: $50,000,000 + $4,250,000 = $54,250,000. That seems correct.\n\nNow, room revenue:\n\n200 rooms * 75% occupancy * $300 per night = 150 rooms * $300 = $45,000 per night.\n\nAnnual room revenue: $45,000 * 365 = $16,425,000.\n\nAdditional revenue is 25% of total income, which includes both room revenue and additional revenue. So, I set up the equation T = R / 0.75, which gave T = $21,900,000.\n\nThen, payback period = $54,250,000 / $21,900,000 \u2248 2.477 years, or about 2 years and 6 months.\n\nHmm, that seems plausible. But perhaps I should consider other factors, like operating costs, maintenance, etc. However, based on the information provided, this seems to be the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the additional revenue is separate from the room revenue, not dependent on the total income. Let's consider that possibility.\n\nIf additional revenue from other facilities is 25% of the room revenue, then:\n\nAdditional revenue = 0.25 * $16,425,000 = $4,106,250.\n\nThen, total annual revenue = room revenue + additional revenue = $16,425,000 + $4,106,250 = $20,531,250.\n\nThen, payback period = $54,250,000 / $20,531,250 \u2248 2.64 years, or about 2 years and 8 months.\n\nBut according to the problem, it says \"additional revenue from other facilities amounting to 25% of total income.\" Total income would be the sum of room revenue and additional revenue, so my first approach seems more accurate.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, additional revenue is dependent on total income, which includes additional revenue itself. It's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"additional revenue from other facilities amounting to 25% of total income\" means that additional revenue is 25% of the room revenue.\n\nIf that's the case, then additional revenue = 0.25 * room revenue.\n\nSo, total income = room revenue + additional revenue = room revenue + 0.25 * room revenue = 1.25 * room revenue.\n\nTherefore, total income = $16,425,000 * 1.25 = $20,531,250.\n\nThen, payback period = $54,250,000 / $20,531,250 \u2248 2.64 years.\n\nThis is similar to the second approach.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, \"additional revenue from other facilities amounting to 25% of total income.\" This seems to imply that additional revenue is 25% of the total income, which includes both room revenue and additional revenue.\n\nIn that case, the first approach is correct, where total income T = room revenue / (1 - 0.25) = room revenue / 0.75.\n\nSo, T = $16,425,000 / 0.75 = $21,900,000.\n\nThen, payback period = $54,250,000 / $21,900,000 \u2248 2.477 years.\n\nI think this is the accurate calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that additional revenue is $21,900,000, and room revenue is $16,425,000, making total income $38,325,000, but that doesn't make sense because total income can't be the sum of room revenue and additional revenue if additional revenue is already 25% of total income.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the additional revenue as a given fixed amount, but no, it's stated as a percentage of total income.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that additional revenue is 25% of the room revenue, not of the total income. In that case, additional revenue = 0.25 * $16,425,000 = $4,106,250.\n\nThen, total income = room revenue + additional revenue = $16,425,000 + $4,106,250 = $20,531,250.\n\nPayback period = $54,250,000 / $20,531,250 \u2248 2.64 years.\n\nBut considering the phrasing, \"additional revenue from other facilities amounting to 25% of total income,\" it seems more accurate to consider that the additional revenue is 25% of the total income, which includes both room revenue and additional revenue.\n\nIn that case, the first approach is correct, leading to a payback period of approximately 2.477 years.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, perhaps the best approach is to calculate both scenarios and consider which one is more plausible.\n\nFirst scenario:\n\n- Total income T = room revenue + additional revenue\n\n- Additional revenue = 0.25 * T\n\n- Therefore, T = room revenue / 0.75 = $16,425,000 / 0.75 = $21,900,000\n\n- Payback period = $54,250,000 / $21,900,000 \u2248 2.477 years\n\nSecond scenario:\n\n- Additional revenue = 0.25 * room revenue = 0.25 * $16,425,000 = $4,106,250\n\n- Total income = room revenue + additional revenue = $16,425,000 + $4,106,250 = $20,531,250\n\n- Payback period = $54,250,000 / $20,531,250 \u2248 2.64 years\n\nGiven these two scenarios, the payback period differs by about 0.163 years, which is approximately 2 months.\n\nConsidering the phrasing of the problem, I think the first scenario is more accurate, as it accounts for the additional revenue being a portion of the total income, including both room revenue and additional revenue.\n\nTherefore, the payback period is approximately 2.477 years, or about 2 years and 6 months.\n\nHowever, in real-world scenarios, there are often other costs to consider, such as operating expenses, maintenance, marketing, and so on. But based on the information provided, which only includes construction costs and revenue, the payback period is approximately 2 years and 6 months.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this is a simplified calculation and doesn't take into account factors like inflation, changes in occupancy rates over time, or the time value of money. For a more accurate analysis, a discounted cash flow model or internal rate of return might be more appropriate, but for the purposes of this problem, the payback period is sufficient.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nTotal construction cost: $54,250,000\n\nAnnual total revenue: $21,900,000\n\nPayback period: Approximately 2.477 years, or 2 years and 6 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.477 \\text{ years}} \\]"
