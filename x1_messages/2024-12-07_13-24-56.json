        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 40 students. Out of these, 12 play soccer, 18 play basketball, and the rest play both sports. We need to find out how many play both soccer and basketball.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being said. There are students who play only soccer, only basketball, and some who play both. The total number of students is 40.\n\nNow, according to the problem, 12 students play soccer. This includes those who play only soccer and those who play both soccer and basketball.\n\nSimilarly, 18 students play basketball. This includes those who play only basketball and those who play both sports.\n\nThe rest of the students, which means those who are not in the 12 who play soccer or the 18 who play basketball, play both sports.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Because if some students play both sports, they should be included in both the soccer and basketball groups.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Let S be the set of students who play soccer.\n\n- Let B be the set of students who play basketball.\n\n- Let's say x students play both sports.\n\nSo, the number of students who play only soccer would be 12 - x.\n\nSimilarly, the number of students who play only basketball would be 18 - x.\n\nAnd the number of students who play both is x.\n\nNow, the total number of students is the sum of those who play only soccer, only basketball, and both.\n\nSo, (12 - x) + (18 - x) + x = 40.\n\nLet's simplify this equation.\n\n12 - x + 18 - x + x = 40\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n12 + 18 - x - x + x = 40\n\n30 - x = 40\n\nNow, solving for x:\n\n- x = 40 - 30\n\n- x = 10\n\nSo, 10 students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this.\n\nIf 12 play soccer, including those who play both, and 18 play basketball, including those who play both, and 10 play both, then:\n\nOnly soccer: 12 - 10 = 2\n\nOnly basketball: 18 - 10 = 8\n\nBoth: 10\n\nTotal: 2 + 8 + 10 = 20\n\nBut the class has 40 students. That doesn't add up.\n\nHmm, there must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me consider using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\n|S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |S \u222a B| is the number of students who play either soccer or basketball or both.\n\n- |S| is the number of students who play soccer.\n\n- |B| is the number of students who play basketball.\n\n- |S \u2229 B| is the number of students who play both sports.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the rest of the students play both sports. But wait, that doesn't make sense. If the rest play both sports, does that mean that everyone not in the soccer or basketball groups plays both?\n\nWait, I think there's confusion in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"In a class of 40 students, 12 students play soccer, 18 students play basketball, and the rest play both sports.\" \n\nSo, the rest of the students, who don't play just soccer or just basketball, play both.\n\nSo, perhaps the total number of students is the sum of those who play only soccer, only basketball, and both.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the rest play both.\n\nSo, maybe it's better to think of it this way:\n\nTotal students = students who play only soccer + students who play only basketball + students who play both.\n\nGiven that, we have:\n\n40 = (students who play only soccer) + (students who play only basketball) + (students who play both).\n\nNow, students who play soccer = those who play only soccer + those who play both.\n\nSimilarly, students who play basketball = those who play only basketball + those who play both.\n\nSo,\n\n12 = only soccer + both\n\n18 = only basketball + both\n\nLet's denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\nLet s be the number of students who play only soccer.\n\nLet b be the number of students who play only basketball.\n\nLet b0 be the number of students who play both.\n\nThen,\n\ns + b0 = 12  ...(1)\n\nb + b0 = 18  ...(2)\n\ns + b + b0 = 40 ...(3)\n\nWe need to find b0.\n\nFrom equation (1), s = 12 - b0.\n\nFrom equation (2), b = 18 - b0.\n\nPlugging these into equation (3):\n\n(12 - b0) + (18 - b0) + b0 = 40\n\n12 - b0 + 18 - b0 + b0 = 40\n\n30 - b0 = 40\n\n-b0 = 10\n\nb0 = -10\n\nWait, that gives b0 = -10, which doesn't make sense because the number of students can't be negative.\n\nHmm, there must be an error in the setup.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that the rest of the students play both sports, meaning that apart from those who play only soccer and those who play only basketball, the remaining students play both.\n\nBut according to the problem, \"the rest play both sports.\"\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to consider that the total number of students is equal to those who play only soccer plus those who play only basketball plus those who play both.\n\nBut that seems correct.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is in the interpretation of \"the rest play both sports.\"\n\nPerhaps it means that any student not in the soccer or basketball groups plays both.\n\nBut according to set theory, the union of soccer and basketball players should be those who play at least one of the sports.\n\nIf some play both, they are included in both groups.\n\nBut according to the problem, the rest play both.\n\nWait, maybe it's worded differently.\n\nLet me consider that the rest of the students, who are not in the soccer or basketball groups, play both.\n\nBut that would imply that there are students who don't play soccer or basketball, but according to the problem, 12 play soccer, 18 play basketball, and the rest play both.\n\nWait, so perhaps the rest of the students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nSo, total students = those who play only soccer + those who play only basketball + those who play both.\n\nGiven that, we have:\n\n40 = (12 - x) + (18 - x) + x\n\nWhere x is the number of students who play both.\n\nWait, but in this setup, it's similar to what I did earlier, which led to a negative number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that apart from those who play soccer and those who play basketball, the remaining students play both.\n\nBut that would mean:\n\nStudents who play only soccer: 12 - x\n\nStudents who play only basketball: 18 - x\n\nStudents who play both: x\n\nTotal: (12 - x) + (18 - x) + x = 40\n\nSimplifying: 30 - x = 40\n\nSo, -x = 10, which gives x = -10.\n\nThis can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is misphrased.\n\nPerhaps it means that besides those who play only soccer and only basketball, the rest play both.\n\nIn that case, the equation would be:\n\nOnly soccer: 12 - x\n\nOnly basketball: 18 - x\n\nBoth: x\n\nTotal: (12 - x) + (18 - x) + x = 40\n\nWhich simplifies to 30 - x = 40, leading to x = -10.\n\nThis suggests a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends to say that students who don't play soccer or basketball play both, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that students who don't play soccer or don't play basketball play both, which is also confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and it should state the number of students who play only soccer and only basketball, or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nAccording to inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal students = number who play soccer + number who play basketball - number who play both + number who play neither.\n\nBut according to the problem, \"the rest play both,\" which is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the rest play both\" means that students who don't play soccer or basketball play both, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it means that students who don't play only soccer or only basketball play both.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that the rest of the students play both soccer and basketball, meaning that they are not included in the counts of those who play only soccer or only basketball.\n\nIn that case, the total number of students would be equal to only soccer + only basketball + both.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that:\n\nOnly soccer: 12 - x\n\nOnly basketball: 18 - x\n\nBoth: x\n\nTotal: 40\n\nSo, (12 - x) + (18 - x) + x = 40\n\nSimplify: 30 - x = 40\n\nThus, x = -10, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests an inconsistency in the problem's numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that students who don't play soccer or don't play basketball play both, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and it should say that some students play neither sport.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the rest play both\" means that students who aren't in the soccer or basketball groups play both, which would imply that those playing both are counted in both the soccer and basketball groups.\n\nBut according to standard set theory, those who play both are included in both the soccer and basketball counts.\n\nGiven that, the total number of students involved in at least one sport would be |S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B|.\n\nGiven |S| = 12, |B| = 18, and |S \u2229 B| = x.\n\nThen, |S \u222a B| = 12 + 18 - x = 30 - x.\n\nIf the total number of students is 40, and assuming that all students play at least one sport, then |S \u222a B| should be 40.\n\nThus, 30 - x = 40\n\nSo, -x = 10, which gives x = -10, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that not all students play at least one sport, meaning some play neither.\n\nBut the problem says \"the rest play both,\" which seems to imply that some play neither, which contradicts the earlier assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that besides those who play only soccer and only basketball, the remaining students play both.\n\nIn that case, the equation is:\n\nOnly soccer: 12 - x\n\nOnly basketball: 18 - x\n\nBoth: x\n\nNeither: 40 - [(12 - x) + (18 - x) + x] = 40 - (30 - x) = 10 + x\n\nBut if \"the rest play both,\" and neither is 10 + x, but both is x, which seems inconsistent.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider defining the number of students who play both as x.\n\nThen, the number of students who play only soccer is 12 - x.\n\nThe number who play only basketball is 18 - x.\n\nThe rest play both, which is x.\n\nTotal students: (12 - x) + (18 - x) + x = 40\n\nSimplify: 30 - x = 40\n\nSo, x = -10, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that the problem's numbers are inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that 12 students play only soccer, 18 play only basketball, and the rest play both.\n\nIn that case, total students would be only soccer + only basketball + both.\n\nSo, 12 (only soccer) + 18 (only basketball) + both = 40\n\nThus, both = 40 - 12 - 18 = 10 students play both.\n\nBut the problem says \"12 students play soccer, 18 students play basketball, and the rest play both.\"\n\nIf 12 play soccer (which includes those who play both), and 18 play basketball (which includes those who play both), then the rest play both.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to rephrase:\n\nTotal students = only soccer + only basketball + both + neither.\n\nBut according to the problem, \"the rest play both,\" which might imply that neither is zero, but earlier calculations suggest otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that students who don't play only soccer or only basketball play both, which would be similar to students who play both sports.\n\nBut this seems to be leading in circles.\n\nGiven the confusion in interpreting the problem, perhaps the most plausible interpretation is that 12 students play only soccer, 18 play only basketball, and the rest play both.\n\nIn that case, the number of students playing both would be 40 - 12 - 18 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly stated, and it should specify the number of students playing only soccer and only basketball.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this, and the inconsistency in the numbers, I'm going to go with the interpretation that 12 play only soccer, 18 play only basketball, and the rest play both, leading to 10 students playing both sports.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
