        "content": "\"Et tu, Brute?\" is a famous Latin phrase often translated as \"You too, Brutus?\" or \"And you, Brutus?\" It is attributed to Julius Caesar and is supposed to have been his last words as he was being assassinated by a group of Roman senators, including Marcus Junius Brutus, on the Ides of March (March 15), 44 BC. The phrase suggests that Caesar was shocked and betrayed by his friend and ally Brutus joining the conspiracy against him.\n\nThis line is particularly famous through William Shakespeare's play \"Julius Caesar,\" where it is used by Caesar upon seeing Brutus among his assassins. However, it's worth noting that there is no contemporary evidence that Caesar actually spoke these words; the phrase originates from Shakespeare's dramatization of the event.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question, the phrase 'Et tu, Brute?' is associated with the assassination of Julius Caesar."
