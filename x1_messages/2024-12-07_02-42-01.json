        "content": "Creating a Java application to simulate a bank account system is a great way to understand object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. In this simulation, we'll design classes for accounts, transactions, and customers, and implement methods for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds between accounts.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Customer Class\n\nFirst, we need a `Customer` class to represent the individuals who own the bank accounts.\n\n```java\npublic class Customer {\n    private String name;\n    private String customerId;\n\n    public Customer(String name, String customerId) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.customerId = customerId;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public String getCustomerId() {\n        return customerId;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Account Class\n\nNext, we'll create an `Account` class to represent bank accounts. Each account will have a unique account number, a balance, and an associated customer.\n\n```java\npublic class Account {\n    private String accountNumber;\n    private double balance;\n    private Customer customer;\n\n    public Account(String accountNumber, Customer customer) {\n        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n        this.customer = customer;\n        this.balance = 0.0;\n    }\n\n    public String getAccountNumber() {\n        return accountNumber;\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n\n    public Customer getCustomer() {\n        return customer;\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n            System.out.println(\"Deposited: \" + amount);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid deposit amount.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount) {\n            balance -= amount;\n            System.out.println(\"Withdrew: \" + amount);\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Insufficient funds or invalid withdrawal amount.\");\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define the Transaction Class\n\nWe'll create a `Transaction` class to represent transactions between accounts.\n\n```java\npublic class Transaction {\n    private Account fromAccount;\n    private Account toAccount;\n    private double amount;\n\n    public Transaction(Account fromAccount, Account toAccount, double amount) {\n        this.fromAccount = fromAccount;\n        this.toAccount = toAccount;\n        this.amount = amount;\n    }\n\n    public boolean execute() {\n        if (fromAccount.withdraw(amount)) {\n            toAccount.deposit(amount);\n            System.out.println(\"Transferred: \" + amount + \" from \" + fromAccount.getAccountNumber() + \" to \" + toAccount.getAccountNumber());\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Transfer failed.\");\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create the Bank Application\n\nNow, we'll create a `Bank` class to manage multiple accounts and perform operations.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class Bank {\n    private Map<String, Account> accounts;\n\n    public Bank() {\n        accounts = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public void createAccount(String accountNumber, Customer customer) {\n        if (!accounts.containsKey(accountNumber)) {\n            accounts.put(accountNumber, new Account(accountNumber, customer));\n            System.out.println(\"Account created: \" + accountNumber);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Account already exists.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public Account getAccount(String accountNumber) {\n        return accounts.get(accountNumber);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Bank bank = new Bank();\n\n        // Create customers\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"Alice\", \"Cust001\");\n        Customer customer2 = new Customer(\"Bob\", \"Cust002\");\n\n        // Create accounts\n        bank.createAccount(\"Acc001\", customer1);\n        bank.createAccount(\"Acc002\", customer2);\n\n        // Deposit funds\n        Account aliceAccount = bank.getAccount(\"Acc001\");\n        aliceAccount.deposit(1000);\n\n        // Withdraw funds\n        aliceAccount.withdraw(200);\n\n        // Transfer funds\n        Account bobAccount = bank.getAccount(\"Acc002\");\n        Transaction transfer = new Transaction(aliceAccount, bobAccount, 300);\n        transfer.execute();\n\n        // Check balances\n        System.out.println(\"Alice's balance: \" + aliceAccount.getBalance());\n        System.out.println(\"Bob's balance: \" + bobAccount.getBalance());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Customer Class**: Represents a bank customer with a name and customer ID.\n2. **Account Class**: Represents a bank account with an account number, balance, and associated customer. Includes methods for depositing and withdrawing funds.\n3. **Transaction Class**: Manages fund transfers between two accounts. Ensures that funds are withdrawn from one account and deposited into another.\n4. **Bank Class**: Manages multiple accounts using a map for quick access. Provides methods to create accounts and retrieve them by account number. The `main` method demonstrates creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds.\n\nThis setup follows OOP principles by encapsulating related data and behaviors within classes and utilizing relationships between these classes to model real-world entities and interactions."
