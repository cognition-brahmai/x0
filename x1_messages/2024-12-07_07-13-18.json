        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that reads employee data from a CSV file and generates an HTML report showing the number of employees per department, sorted by department name. The script should also accept command-line arguments for the input CSV and output HTML file paths. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to handle command-line arguments. Python's `argparse` module is perfect for this. I'll set up arguments for the input CSV path and the output HTML path.\n\nNext, I need to read the CSV file. The `csv` module in Python should work fine for this. The CSV has columns: id, first_name, last_name, email, and department. I need to count the number of employees in each department.\n\nTo count employees per department, I can use a dictionary where the keys are department names and the values are the counts. As I read each row from the CSV, I'll check the department and increment the count in the dictionary.\n\nAfter reading all the data, I need to sort the departments by name. Since dictionary keys in Python are unordered in older versions, but in Python 3.7 and above, dictionaries maintain insertion order. However, to ensure sorting, I should use `sorted()` on the dictionary keys.\n\nFinally, I need to generate an HTML report. I'll create a string that contains the HTML code, including a table that lists departments and their employee counts. Then, I'll write this string to the specified HTML file.\n\nI should also handle any potential errors, like missing files or incorrect CSV formats, to make the script more robust.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the script:\n\n1. Import necessary modules: `argparse` for command-line arguments, `csv` for reading CSV files.\n\n2. Set up argparse to accept input CSV path and output HTML path.\n\n3. Read the CSV file using `csv.reader`.\n\n4. Initialize a dictionary to count employees per department.\n\n5. Iterate through each row in the CSV, updating the department counts.\n\n6. Sort the departments by name.\n\n7. Create an HTML string with a table listing departments and employee counts.\n\n8. Write the HTML string to the specified output file.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like an empty CSV file or departments with zero employees (though if a department has no employees, it might not appear in the CSV).\n\nLet me sketch a rough code outline:\n\n```python\nimport argparse\nimport csv\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Generate HTML report of employees per department.')\n    parser.add_argument('input_csv', help='Path to the input CSV file')\n    parser.add_argument('output_html', help='Path to the output HTML file')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    try:\n        with open(args.input_csv, newline='') as csvfile:\n            reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)\n            dept_counts = {}\n            for row in reader:\n                dept = row['department']\n                if dept in dept_counts:\n                    dept_counts[dept] += 1\n                else:\n                    dept_counts[dept] = 1\n\n            sorted_depts = sorted(dept_counts.keys())\n\n            html_content = '''\n            <html>\n            <head>\n                <title>Employee Department Report</title>\n            </head>\n            <body>\n                <table border=\"1\">\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Department</th>\n                        <th>Number of Employees</th>\n                    </tr>\n            '''\n            for dept in sorted_depts:\n                html_content += f'<tr><td>{dept}</td><td>{dept_counts[dept]}</td></tr>'\n            html_content += '''\n                </table>\n            </body>\n            </html>\n            '''\n\n            with open(args.output_html, 'w') as htmlfile:\n                htmlfile.write(html_content)\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: The file {args.input_csv} was not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to implement this script, testing each part as I go along to ensure it works correctly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python script that reads employee data from a CSV file and generates an HTML report showing the number of employees per department, sorted by department name. The script should accept command-line arguments for the input CSV file path and the output HTML file path.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Command-Line Arguments**: Use the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments for input and output file paths.\n2. **Reading CSV Data**: Use the `csv` module to read the employee data from the specified CSV file.\n3. **Counting Employees per Department**: Use a dictionary to count the number of employees in each department.\n4. **Sorting Departments**: Sort the departments by name.\n5. **Generating HTML Report**: Create an HTML string with a table listing departments and their employee counts, and write this string to the specified HTML file.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport argparse\nimport csv\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Generate HTML report of employees per department.')\n    parser.add_argument('input_csv', help='Path to the input CSV file')\n    parser.add_argument('output_html', help='Path to the output HTML file')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    try:\n        with open(args.input_csv, newline='') as csvfile:\n            reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)\n            dept_counts = {}\n            for row in reader:\n                dept = row['department']\n                if dept in dept_counts:\n                    dept_counts[dept] += 1\n                else:\n                    dept_counts[dept] = 1\n\n            sorted_depts = sorted(dept_counts.keys())\n\n            html_content = '''\n            <html>\n            <head>\n                <title>Employee Department Report</title>\n            </head>\n            <body>\n                <table border=\"1\">\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Department</th>\n                        <th>Number of Employees</th>\n                    </tr>\n            '''\n            for dept in sorted_depts:\n                html_content += f'<tr><td>{dept}</td><td>{dept_counts[dept]}</td></tr>'\n            html_content += '''\n                </table>\n            </body>\n            </html>\n            '''\n\n            with open(args.output_html, 'w') as htmlfile:\n                htmlfile.write(html_content)\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: The file {args.input_csv} was not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Command-Line Arguments**: The `argparse` module is used to define and parse command-line arguments for the input CSV file path and the output HTML file path.\n2. **Reading CSV Data**: The `csv.DictReader` class is used to read the CSV file into a dictionary, making it easy to access columns by name.\n3. **Counting Employees per Department**: A dictionary is used to count the number of employees in each department by iterating through each row of the CSV data.\n4. **Sorting Departments**: The department names are sorted using the `sorted()` function.\n5. **Generating HTML Report**: An HTML string is constructed with a table that lists each department and its corresponding employee count. This string is then written to the specified HTML file.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward way to generate an HTML report from employee data in a CSV file, sorted by department name."
