        "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that! So, you want a Python script that acts as a simple calculator, handling addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. And you want it to use the Shunting Yard algorithm to parse the mathematical expressions. Sounds interesting!\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what the Shunting Yard algorithm is. It's a method for parsing mathematical expressions specified in infix notation (which is the standard way we write expressions, like 2 + 3 * 4) and converting them into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which is easier to evaluate.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Take an infix expression as input.\n\n2. Use the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert it into RPN.\n\n3. Evaluate the RPN expression to get the result.\n\nDoes that sound right to you?\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the Shunting Yard algorithm. It was invented by Edsger Dijkstra to convert infix expressions to postfix (RPN). The algorithm uses a stack to hold operators and outputs the final RPN expression.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the algorithm:\n\n- Read the infix expression from left to right.\n\n- For each token:\n\n- If it's a number, output it.\n\n- If it's an operator, push it onto the stack. If there are operators on the stack with higher precedence, pop them onto the output before pushing the new operator.\n\n- If it's a left parenthesis, push it onto the stack.\n\n- If it's a right parenthesis, pop operators from the stack to the output until a left parenthesis is encountered, then pop the left parenthesis.\n\n- After reading all tokens, pop any remaining operators from the stack to the output.\n\nOnce we have the RPN expression, evaluating it is straightforward:\n\n- Use a stack to hold numbers.\n\n- For each token in the RPN expression:\n\n- If it's a number, push it onto the stack.\n\n- If it's an operator, pop the top two numbers from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.\n\n- At the end, the stack should have only one number, which is the result.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, we need to tokenize the input expression. That means breaking it down into numbers and operators. For example, the expression \"3 + 4 * 2 / ( 1 - 5 )\" should be tokenized into: ['3', '+', '4', '*', '2', '/', '(', '1', '-', '5', ')']\n\nWe can use regular expressions to split the input string into tokens.\n\nNext, we need to implement the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert these tokens into RPN.\n\nThen, we need to evaluate the RPN expression.\n\nLet's consider the precedence and associativity of the operators:\n\n- Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.\n\n- Operators with the same precedence are evaluated based on their associativity. In most programming languages, all these operators are left-associative.\n\nSo, in the Shunting Yard algorithm, when comparing operators, we need to consider their precedence and associativity to decide whether to pop operators from the stack.\n\nFor example, in the expression \"2 + 3 * 4\", the '*' has higher precedence than '+', so the Shunting Yard algorithm should output '2 3 4 * +', which evaluates to 14.\n\nWait a minute, actually, in RPN, that should be '2 3 4 * +', but let's verify.\n\nWait, no. '2 3 4 * +' would be:\n\n- Push 2\n\n- Push 3\n\n- Push 4\n\n- Multiply 3 and 4 to get 12\n\n- Add 2 and 12 to get 14\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: \"2 * 3 + 4\"\n\nShould be '2 3 * 4 +', which is:\n\n- Push 2\n\n- Push 3\n\n- Multiply to get 6\n\n- Push 4\n\n- Add 6 and 4 to get 10\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, let's think about how to handle parentheses. Parentheses should group subexpressions, so anything inside parentheses should be evaluated first.\n\nFor example, in \"( 2 + 3 ) * 4\", the addition inside the parentheses should be done first.\n\nIn RPN, this would be '2 3 + 4 *', which is:\n\n- Push 2\n\n- Push 3\n\n- Add to get 5\n\n- Push 4\n\n- Multiply 5 and 4 to get 20\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's consider division and subtraction.\n\nFor subtraction, remember that it's left-associative, just like addition and subtraction.\n\nFor example, \"10 - 4 - 2\" should be evaluated as (10 - 4) - 2 = 4, not 10 - (4 - 2) = 8.\n\nSimilarly, division is left-associative.\n\nSo, in the Shunting Yard algorithm, when an operator has the same precedence as the one on top of the stack, and both are left-associative, we should pop the top operator onto the output and then push the new operator onto the stack.\n\nWait, no. For left-associative operators, if the incoming operator has the same precedence as the one on top of the stack, we pop the top operator onto the output before pushing the new one.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor right-associative operators, like exponentiation, you would push the new operator onto the stack without popping the top operator, but since we're only dealing with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are left-associative, we don't need to worry about that.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in code.\n\nFirst, we need to define the precedence of operators. We can use numbers to represent precedence levels.\n\nLet's assign:\n\n- Multiplication and division: precedence 2\n\n- Addition and subtraction: precedence 1\n\nThat way, higher numbers indicate higher precedence.\n\nWe'll need a function to get the precedence of an operator.\n\nAlso, we need to handle parentheses, which have the highest effective precedence since they group subexpressions.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, tokenize the input expression.\n\nWe can use the re module in Python to split the input string into tokens.\n\nFor example:\n\nimport re\n\ndef tokenize(expression):\n\nreturn re.findall(r'\\d+|\\+|\\-|\\*|\\/|\\(|\\)', expression)\n\nThis should work for our purposes.\n\nNext, implement the shunting_yard function.\n\nWe'll need a stack to hold operators, and a list to hold the output (RPN expression).\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\ndef shunting_yard(tokens):\n\noutput = []\n\nstack = []\n\nfor token in tokens:\n\nif token is a number:\n\noutput.append(token)\n\nelif token is an operator:\n\nwhile stack is not empty and top of stack is an operator with higher or equal precedence:\n\noutput.append(stack.pop())\n\nstack.append(token)\n\nelif token is '(':\n\nstack.append(token)\n\nelif token is ')':\n\nwhile top of stack is not '(':\n\noutput.append(stack.pop())\n\nstack.pop()  # Remove the '(' from the stack\n\n# After processing all tokens, pop any remaining operators from the stack to the output\n\nwhile stack is not empty:\n\noutput.append(stack.pop())\n\nreturn output\n\nWait, but we need to consider associativity when deciding whether to pop operators with equal precedence.\n\nFor left-associative operators, we pop them if they have higher or equal precedence.\n\nFor right-associative operators, we only pop them if they have higher precedence.\n\nBut since all our operators are left-associative, we can pop them if they have higher or equal precedence.\n\nSo, in the code, it would be:\n\nwhile stack and is_operator(stack[-1]) and precedence(stack[-1]) >= precedence(token):\n\noutput.append(stack.pop())\n\nThen push the new operator onto the stack.\n\nAlso, when encountering a ')', we pop operators until we reach the matching '('.\n\nMake sure to handle cases where parentheses are mismatched.\n\nSimilarly, ensure that the stack doesn't have any remaining '(' after processing all tokens.\n\nOtherwise, it's a syntax error.\n\nAlright, now, let's think about evaluating the RPN expression.\n\nWe'll need a function that takes the RPN list and evaluates it.\n\nSomething like:\n\ndef evaluate_rpn(rpn):\n\nstack = []\n\nfor token in rpn:\n\nif token is a number:\n\nstack.append(int(token))\n\nelse:\n\nb = stack.pop()\n\na = stack.pop()\n\nif token is '+':\n\nstack.append(a + b)\n\nelif token is '-':\n\nstack.append(a - b)\n\nelif token is '*':\n\nstack.append(a * b)\n\nelif token is '/':\n\nif b == 0:\n\nraise ValueError(\"Division by zero\")\n\nstack.append(a / b)\n\nif len(stack) != 1:\n\nraise ValueError(\"Invalid expression\")\n\nreturn stack[0]\n\nThis should work.\n\nWe assume that the RPN expression is valid.\n\nWe should also make sure that the input expression is valid, but for simplicity, we can assume that the user inputs valid expressions.\n\nNow, let's think about putting it all together.\n\nWe'll have a main function that:\n\n1. Takes an input expression from the user.\n\n2. Tokenizes it.\n\n3. Converts it to RPN using the Shunting Yard algorithm.\n\n4. Evaluates the RPN expression.\n\n5. Prints the result.\n\nAlso, we can put this in a loop so that the user can perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.\n\nLet's sketch the main function:\n\ndef main():\n\nwhile True:\n\nexpression = input(\"Enter an expression (or 'quit' to exit): \")\n\nif expression.lower() == 'quit':\n\nbreak\n\ntokens = tokenize(expression)\n\nrpn = shunting_yard(tokens)\n\nresult = evaluate_rpn(rpn)\n\nprint(\"Result:\", result)\n\nThis way, the user can enter expressions repeatedly until they type 'quit'.\n\nNow, let's consider some test cases to verify our implementation.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nExpression: 3 + 4 * 2 / ( 1 - 5 )\n\nExpected RPN: 3 4 2 * 1 5 - / +\n\nExpected result: 3 + (8 / (-4)) = 3 + (-2) = 1\n\nTest case 2:\n\nExpression: 10 + 2 * 6 - 3\n\nExpected RPN: 10 2 6 * + 3 -\n\nExpected result: 10 + 12 - 3 = 19\n\nTest case 3:\n\nExpression: (15 / (7 - (1 + 1))) * 3 - (2 + (1 + 1))\n\nExpected RPN: 15 7 1 1 + - / 3 * 2 1 1 + + -\n\nExpected result: (15 / (7 - 2)) * 3 - (2 + 2) = (15 / 5) * 3 - 4 = 3 * 3 - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5\n\nWe should test these to ensure our implementation is correct.\n\nAlso, need to handle negative numbers.\n\nFor example, expression: 5 * -6\n\nThis would require handling negative signs as either unary operators or as signs belonging to the number.\n\nIn our current tokenization, '-6' would be treated as a single token, which is a negative number.\n\nSo, in the tokenize function, we should adjust the regex to recognize negative numbers.\n\nWe can modify the regex to handle negative numbers:\n\ndef tokenize(expression):\n\n# Match numbers (including negative numbers) and operators/parentheses\n\nreturn re.findall(r'-?\\d+|\\+|\\-|\\*|\\/|\\(|\\)', expression)\n\nThis way, '-6' is treated as a single token.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful with subtraction vs. negative numbers.\n\nFor example, in \"5 - 6\", '-' is a subtraction operator, but in \"-6\", '-' is part of the number.\n\nIn our current tokenization, '5 - 6' would be ['5', '-', '6'], which is correct.\n\nAnd '-6' would be ['-6'], which is also correct.\n\nIn the evaluation, we need to treat '-6' as a single number.\n\nSo, in the evaluate_rpn function, when appending to the stack, we should check if the token is a number (including negative numbers).\n\nSince we're converting the token to int, and '-6' can be directly converted to -6, it should work.\n\nAnother consideration is handling multiple digits numbers, like '100 + 200'.\n\nOur tokenization should handle that, as '100' and '200' are valid tokens.\n\nAlso, need to handle floating point numbers, but for simplicity, we can stick with integers.\n\nIf we want to support floating point, we can adjust the regex accordingly.\n\nFor now, let's keep it to integers.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the is_operator function.\n\nIt's a simple function that checks if a token is one of the operators: '+', '-', '*', '/'.\n\ndef is_operator(token):\n\nreturn token in ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\nSimilarly, the precedence function can be implemented as:\n\ndef precedence(operator):\n\nif operator in ['*', '/']:\n\nreturn 2\n\nelif operator in ['+', '-']:\n\nreturn 1\n\nelse:\n\nreturn 0\n\nThis way, higher numbers indicate higher precedence.\n\nNow, let's consider error handling.\n\nWe should handle cases like:\n\n- Mismatched parentheses.\n\n- Division by zero.\n\n- Invalid tokens.\n\n- Empty expression.\n\nFor now, we can keep it simple and assume valid input, but it's good to have some basic error checking.\n\nFor example, in the shunting_yard function, if we encounter an unmatched ')', we can raise an error.\n\nSimilarly, in evaluate_rpn, if the stack doesn't have exactly one element at the end, it's an invalid expression.\n\nAlso, handle division by zero.\n\nAlright, I think we have a solid plan.\n\nLet me summarize the steps:\n\n1. Tokenize the input expression using regex.\n\n2. Use the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert the infix expression to RPN.\n\n3. Evaluate the RPN expression to get the result.\n\n4. Implement a loop in the main function to allow multiple calculations.\n\n5. Test the implementation with various expressions to ensure correctness.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the code based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple calculator that uses the Shunting Yard algorithm to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Tokenize the Expression:**\n   - Use regular expressions to split the input string into numbers and operators.\n\n2. **Shunting Yard Algorithm:**\n   - Convert the infix expression to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).\n   - Use a stack to hold operators and output the final RPN expression.\n\n3. **Evaluate RPN Expression:**\n   - Use a stack to evaluate the RPN expression step by step.\n\n4. **Main Function:**\n   - Allow user to input expressions repeatedly and get results until they choose to quit.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef tokenize(expression):\n    # Match numbers (including negative numbers) and operators/parentheses\n    return re.findall(r'-?\\d+|\\+|\\-|\\*|\\/|\\(|\\)', expression)\n\ndef is_operator(token):\n    return token in ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef precedence(operator):\n    if operator in ['*', '/']:\n        return 2\n    elif operator in ['+', '-']:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef shunting_yard(tokens):\n    output = []\n    stack = []\n    for token in tokens:\n        if token.lstrip('-').isdigit():\n            output.append(token)\n        elif is_operator(token):\n            while stack and is_operator(stack[-1]) and precedence(stack[-1]) >= precedence(token):\n                output.append(stack.pop())\n            stack.append(token)\n        elif token == '(':\n            stack.append(token)\n        elif token == ')':\n            while stack and stack[-1] != '(':\n                output.append(stack.pop())\n            if not stack:\n                raise ValueError(\"Mismatched parentheses\")\n            stack.pop()  # Remove the '(' from the stack\n    while stack:\n        if stack[-1] in ['(', ')']:\n            raise ValueError(\"Mismatched parentheses\")\n        output.append(stack.pop())\n    return output\n\ndef evaluate_rpn(rpn):\n    stack = []\n    for token in rpn:\n        if token.lstrip('-').isdigit():\n            stack.append(int(token))\n        else:\n            if len(stack) < 2:\n                raise ValueError(\"Invalid expression\")\n            b = stack.pop()\n            a = stack.pop()\n            if token == '+':\n                stack.append(a + b)\n            elif token == '-':\n                stack.append(a - b)\n            elif token == '*':\n                stack.append(a * b)\n            elif token == '/':\n                if b == 0:\n                    raise ValueError(\"Division by zero\")\n                stack.append(a / b)\n    if len(stack) != 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid expression\")\n    return stack[0]\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        expression = input(\"Enter an expression (or 'quit' to exit): \")\n        if expression.lower() == 'quit':\n            break\n        try:\n            tokens = tokenize(expression)\n            rpn = shunting_yard(tokens)\n            result = evaluate_rpn(rpn)\n            print(\"Result:\", result)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"Error:\", e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Tokenize the Expression:**\n   - The `tokenize` function uses a regular expression to split the input string into tokens (numbers and operators).\n\n2. **Shunting Yard Algorithm:**\n   - The `shunting_yard` function converts the infix expression to RPN using a stack to hold operators.\n   - It handles operator precedence and associativity, and manages parentheses.\n\n3. **Evaluate RPN Expression:**\n   - The `evaluate_rpn` function evaluates the RPN expression using a stack.\n   - It performs operations based on the operators and pushes numbers onto the stack.\n\n4. **Main Function:**\n   - The `main` function repeatedly takes user input, processes it through the tokenizer, Shunting Yard algorithm, and RPN evaluator, then displays the result.\n   - The loop continues until the user types 'quit'."
