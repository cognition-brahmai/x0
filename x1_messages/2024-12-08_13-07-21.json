        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has a total of 150 cars in their fleet. According to the information, 60% of these are compact cars, 30% are sedans, and the remaining are SUVs. I need to find out how many of each type they have.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of compact cars. Since 60% of the fleet are compact cars, I can find this by taking 60% of 150. To calculate that, I can multiply 150 by 0.60.\n\nSo, 150 times 0.60 is 90. That means there are 90 compact cars.\n\nNext, I'll find out how many sedans there are. It's said that 30% of the fleet are sedans. So, I'll calculate 30% of 150. That's 150 multiplied by 0.30.\n\n150 times 0.30 is 45. So, there are 45 sedans.\n\nNow, to find out how many SUVs there are, I know that the rest of the cars after compact and sedans are SUVs. Since 60% are compact and 30% are sedans, that adds up to 90%. Therefore, the remaining 10% must be SUVs.\n\nTo confirm, I can add up the percentages: 60% + 30% + 10% equals 100%, which makes sense.\n\nSo, to find the number of SUVs, I'll calculate 10% of 150. That's 150 multiplied by 0.10.\n\n150 times 0.10 is 15. Therefore, there are 15 SUVs.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll add up the numbers: 90 compact cars + 45 sedans + 15 SUVs equals 150, which matches the total number of cars in the fleet.\n\nSo, the company has 90 compact cars, 45 sedans, and 15 SUVs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90 \\text{ compact cars}, 45 \\text{ sedans}, 15 \\text{ SUVs}} \\]"
