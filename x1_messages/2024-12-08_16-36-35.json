        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are chickens and rabbits on a farm, and together they have 40 heads and 112 legs. I need to find out how many of each animal there are.\n\nFirst, I know that both chickens and rabbits have one head each. So, if there are 40 heads, that means there are 40 animals in total, right? Now, chickens have 2 legs, and rabbits have 4 legs. So, the total number of legs is 112.\n\nLet me try to set up some equations to solve this. Let's say:\n\n- Let C be the number of chickens.\n\n- Let R be the number of rabbits.\n\nFrom the information given:\n\n1. The total number of animals is 40, so C + R = 40.\n\n2. The total number of legs is 112, so 2C + 4R = 112.\n\nOkay, now I have two equations:\n\nC + R = 40\n\n2C + 4R = 112\n\nI need to solve these equations to find the values of C and R.\n\nMaybe I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation. Let's solve the first equation for C:\n\nC = 40 - R\n\nNow, plug this into the second equation:\n\n2(40 - R) + 4R = 112\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n80 - 2R + 4R = 112\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n80 + 2R = 112\n\nNow, subtract 80 from both sides:\n\n2R = 32\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nR = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 rabbits.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation C = 40 - R:\n\nC = 40 - 16 = 24\n\nTherefore, there are 24 chickens and 16 rabbits.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure this makes sense. Chickens have 2 legs each, so 24 chickens would have 48 legs. Rabbits have 4 legs each, so 16 rabbits would have 64 legs. Total legs: 48 + 64 = 112, which matches the given information. Also, 24 + 16 = 40 animals, which matches the total number of heads.\n\nLooks good to me!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24 \\text{ chickens and } 16 \\text{ rabbits}} \\]"
