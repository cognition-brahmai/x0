        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains: one leaving Town A at 80 km/h heading towards Town B, and another leaving Town B at 100 km/h heading towards Town A. The distance between Town A and Town B is 240 km. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up relative to each other. That means the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is 80 km/h plus 100 km/h, which is 180 km/h.\n\nNow, the total distance between them is 240 km. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nTime = 240 km / 180 km/h\n\nLet me calculate that. 240 divided by 180 is... hmm, that's the same as 24 divided by 18, which simplifies to 4/3.\n\nSo, time is 4/3 hours.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express that in minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can multiply 4/3 by 60.\n\n4/3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 80 minutes.\n\nSo, they will meet after 80 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to consider the ratio of their speeds. The train from Town A is going at 80 km/h, and the one from Town B at 100 km/h. The ratio of their speeds is 8:10, which simplifies to 4:5.\n\nThat means for every 4 parts the first train travels, the second train travels 5 parts in the same time.\n\nThe total parts are 4 + 5 = 9 parts.\n\nThe total distance is 240 km, so each part is 240 / 9 = approximately 26.67 km.\n\nSo, the train from Town A travels 4 parts, which is 4 * 26.67 \u2248 106.68 km, and the train from Town B travels 5 parts, which is 5 * 26.67 \u2248 133.33 km.\n\nNow, to find the time, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nFor the train from Town A:\n\nTime = 106.68 km / 80 km/h = 1.3335 hours\n\nFor the train from Town B:\n\nTime = 133.33 km / 100 km/h = 1.3333 hours\n\nBoth give approximately 1.333 hours, which is 4/3 hours or 80 minutes.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of relative speed. Since they are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 180 km/h, and the time to meet would be the total distance divided by the relative speed, which again is 240 km / 180 km/h = 4/3 hours.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I'm getting the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like the time zone or something, but in this case, it's a straightforward problem.\n\nTherefore, the trains will meet after 80 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
