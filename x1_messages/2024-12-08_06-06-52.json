        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has 17 sheep, and it says \"all but 9 die.\" So, I need to figure out how many sheep are left alive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"all but 9 die\" means. Does it mean that all the sheep die except for 9? Or is there something else I'm missing?\n\nLet me think about it. If all but 9 die, that should mean that only 9 sheep survive. So, the number of sheep left alive would be 9.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's a trick here. Maybe \"all but 9\" doesn't mean that only 9 survive. Maybe it means something different.\n\nLet me look it up. \"All but\" generally means \"all except for.\" So, \"all but 9 die\" should mean that all except for 9 die. Therefore, 9 sheep do not die, and they are left alive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and I need to consider that the farmer has other sheep that aren't included in the original 17. But the question says he has 17 sheep and all but 9 die, so probably, it's just about these 17.\n\nSo, if he has 17 sheep and all but 9 die, then 9 sheep are left alive.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it differently. Maybe I should subtract 9 from 17 to find out how many die. No, that doesn't make sense because \"all but 9 die\" means that all except 9 die.\n\nSo, if he has 17 sheep and all except 9 die, then 9 sheep are left alive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"all but 9\" means that all of them die except for 9, which again leads to 9 sheep surviving.\n\nI think the answer is 9 sheep are left alive.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret this phrase. Sometimes, \"all but 9\" could be misleading, but in this context, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is 9 sheep are left alive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
