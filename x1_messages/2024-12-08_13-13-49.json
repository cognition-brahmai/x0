        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company that produces 1000 widgets per day, and their production increases by 5% each month. We need to find out how many widgets will be produced on the last day of the third month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The production starts at 1000 widgets per day, and every month, the daily production increases by 5%. So, after one month, the daily production will be 1000 plus 5% of 1000. After the second month, it'll increase by another 5% based on the new amount, and so on for three months.\n\nThis sounds like a compound interest problem, where the production increases by a certain percentage each month. In finance, compound interest is calculated on the initial amount and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods. Similarly, here, the production increase is based on the previous month's production.\n\nSo, the formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the exact formula to use here. Let me think.\n\nIn this case, the production increases by 5% each month, and we're dealing with discrete monthly increases. So, perhaps it's more like compound interest compounded monthly, but since it's production per day, and the increase is monthly, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, but the production is per day, and it increases every month. So, each month has a certain number of days, but since it's asking for the production on the last day of the third month, maybe the number of days in each month isn't relevant, as we're only interested in the daily production rate at that specific day.\n\nAssuming that the production increases by 5% at the end of each month, meaning that at the end of month 1, the daily production is increased by 5%, and similarly at the end of month 2 and month 3.\n\nSo, starting with 1000 widgets per day.\n\nAfter month 1:\n\nNew production = 1000 + (5/100)*1000 = 1000 * 1.05 = 1050 widgets per day.\n\nAfter month 2:\n\nNew production = 1050 + (5/100)*1050 = 1050 * 1.05 = 1102.5 widgets per day.\n\nAfter month 3:\n\nNew production = 1102.5 + (5/100)*1102.5 = 1102.5 * 1.05 = 1157.625 widgets per day.\n\nSo, on the last day of the third month, the company will produce 1157.625 widgets.\n\nBut it's unusual to produce a fraction of a widget, so perhaps we should round it to the nearest whole number. Let's say 1158 widgets.\n\nWait, but in the calculations above, after month 3, I got 1157.625. If I round that to the nearest whole number, it would be 1158, as 0.625 is greater than 0.5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the compound interest formula directly.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe formula for amount after n periods with compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount after n periods\n\n- P is the principal amount (initial production)\n\n- r is the rate of increase per period\n\n- n is the number of periods\n\nIn this case:\n\nP = 1000 widgets per day\n\nr = 5% per month = 0.05\n\nn = 3 months\n\nSo,\n\nA = 1000 * (1 + 0.05)^3 = 1000 * (1.05)^3\n\nCalculating 1.05 cubed:\n\n1.05^3 = 1.157625\n\nSo,\n\nA = 1000 * 1.157625 = 1157.625 widgets per day\n\nAgain, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, on the last day of the third month, the company will produce 1157.625 widgets per day.\n\nBut since partial widgets aren't practical, we should probably round it to the nearest whole number.\n\n1157.625 rounds to 1158 widgets.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, especially in production, you might round down if you can't produce a fraction of a widget.\n\nBut generally, rounding rules apply, and since 0.625 is greater than 0.5, it should be rounded up to 1158.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to keep the decimal.\n\nBut since widgets are discrete items, it's better to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1158 widgets.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe the production increases by 5% cumulatively each month, meaning that each month's increase is added to the previous total.\n\nWait, that's exactly how compound interest works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant a simple interest increase, where each month the production increases by 5% of the original amount, not the accumulated amount.\n\nLet's explore that possibility.\n\nIn simple interest, the interest is calculated only on the principal amount, not on the accumulated interest.\n\nSo, in this case, each month the production increases by 5% of the original 1000 widgets.\n\nSo, monthly increase = 5% of 1000 = 50 widgets per day.\n\nAfter three months, the total increase would be 3 * 50 = 150 widgets per day.\n\nTherefore, the production on the last day of the third month would be:\n\n1000 + 150 = 1150 widgets per day.\n\nBut this seems contradictory to the earlier calculation using compound interest.\n\nWhich approach is correct?\n\nThe problem says \"production increases by 5% each month.\"\n\nThis is typically interpreted as a compound increase, where each month's increase is calculated on the previous month's production.\n\nTherefore, the first approach using compound interest is more accurate.\n\nHence, the production on the last day of the third month is 1157.625 widgets per day, which rounds to 1158 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends for the increase to be applied at the end of each month, and the production on the last day of the third month is after three such increases.\n\nUsing the compound interest formula, A = P(1 + r)^n, where n is 3, gives us the correct amount.\n\nSo, sticking with that.\n\nTherefore, the company will produce 1158 widgets on the last day of the third month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1158} \\]"
