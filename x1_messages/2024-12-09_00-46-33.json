        "content": "Let's tackle this chess tournament problem. So, the scenario is that each player plays every other player exactly once, and there were a total of 28 games played. I need to find out how many players participated in the tournament.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's a problem about combinations because each game is a unique pairing of two players. In other words, the number of games is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 players out of the total number of players.\n\nLet's denote the number of players as n. The number of ways to choose 2 players out of n is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis formula represents the total number of games played in the tournament because each pair of players plays exactly one game.\n\nAccording to the problem, this total is 28 games. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for n.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\nn(n-1) = 56\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll expand the left side:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - n = 56\n\\]\n\nTo form a standard quadratic equation, I'll move all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - n - 56 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - n - 56 = 0\n\\]\n\nI need to solve for n. I can do this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -56 and add up to -1 (the coefficient of n).\n\nLet's think:\n\nWhat pairs of factors of -56 add up to -1?\n\nPossible factor pairs of -56:\n\n- 7 and -8: 7 * -8 = -56, and 7 + (-8) = -1. That works!\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic equation as:\n\n\\[\n(n + 7)(n - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the possible solutions for n:\n\n\\[\nn + 7 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = -7 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n = 8\n\\]\n\nSince the number of players cannot be negative, n = -7 is not a valid solution. Therefore, n = 8 is the only feasible solution.\n\nSo, there were 8 players in the tournament.\n\nBut, to make sure, I can verify this by plugging n = 8 back into the original combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches the given total number of games.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other methods to solve this problem. For example, I could list out the number of games for different numbers of players until I reach 28, but that would be more time-consuming and less efficient than using the combination formula.\n\nAnother way is to recognize that the number of games in a round-robin tournament (where each player plays every other player once) is always given by n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of players. So, setting that equal to 28 and solving for n gives the answer directly.\n\nIn conclusion, there were 8 players in the tournament.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
