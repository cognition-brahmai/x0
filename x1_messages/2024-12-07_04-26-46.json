        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to make a simple calculator in Ruby that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. I need to make sure it takes in two numbers and an operator as arguments, and then does the operation and shows the result. Also, it should handle mistakes nicely, like if someone puts in the wrong kind of operator or something.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to get inputs from the command line in Ruby. I think Ruby has a way to access command-line arguments. I recall that ARGV is an array that holds the arguments passed to the script. So, if someone runs the script like this: ruby calculator.rb 5 + 3, then ARGV[0] would be \"5\", ARGV[1] would be \"+\", and ARGV[2] would be \"3\".\n\nI need to make sure there are exactly three arguments: two numbers and one operator. If there are more or fewer, I should give an error message. So, I can check the length of ARGV and see if it's equal to 3. If not, print a message like \"Usage: ruby calculator.rb NUMBER OPERATOR NUMBER\" and maybe list what operators are accepted.\n\nNext, I need to convert the string arguments to numbers. So, ARGV[0] and ARGV[2] should be converted to floats or integers. But I should handle if someone passes something that can't be converted to a number, like a letter or a word. So, I need to try converting them and if it fails, show an error message.\n\nFor the operator, I need to check if it's one of the accepted operators: +, -, *, or /. If it's not, I should show an error message listing the valid operators.\n\nOnce I have two numbers and a valid operator, I can perform the operation. For addition, I'll add the numbers; for subtraction, subtract; for multiplication, multiply; and for division, divide.\n\nI need to be careful with division, especially if the second number is zero. Division by zero isn't allowed, so I should check if the operator is '/' and the second number is zero, and if so, show an error message.\n\nAfter performing the operation, I'll print out the result in a nice format, like \"5 + 3 = 8\".\n\nAlso, I should think about how to structure the code. Maybe I can put the main logic in a method, and handle the argument parsing separately. That might make it cleaner.\n\nLet me start by writing some pseudocode:\n\nif ARGV length is not 3\n\nprint usage message\n\nexit\n\ntry to convert ARGV[0] and ARGV[2] to floats, handle errors\n\nif ARGV[1] is not one of +, -, *, /\n\nprint error message with valid operators\n\nexit\n\nif operator is / and second number is 0\n\nprint error message about division by zero\n\nexit\n\nperform the operation based on the operator\n\nprint the result\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, let's think about how to implement this in Ruby.\n\nFirst, checking the number of arguments:\n\nif ARGV.length != 3\n\nputs \"Usage: ruby calculator.rb NUMBER OPERATOR NUMBER\"\n\nputs \"Accepted operators: +, -, *, /\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\nNext, converting the arguments to numbers. I can use Float() to convert to floating-point numbers. If it can't convert, it will raise an ArgumentError, so I can rescue that.\n\nbegin\n\nnum1 = Float(ARGV[0])\n\nnum2 = Float(ARGV[2])\n\nrescue ArgumentError\n\nputs \"Error: Both first and third arguments must be numbers.\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\nThen, check the operator:\n\noperators = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\nif !operators.include?(ARGV[1])\n\nputs \"Error: Invalid operator. Accepted operators are +, -, *, /.\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\nCheck for division by zero:\n\nif ARGV[1] == '/' && num2 == 0\n\nputs \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\nNow, perform the operation based on the operator. I can use a case statement for this.\n\nresult = case ARGV[1]\n\nwhen '+'\n\nnum1 + num2\n\nwhen '-'\n\nnum1 - num2\n\nwhen '*'\n\nnum1 * num2\n\nwhen '/'\n\nnum1 / num2\n\nelse\n\n# This should never happen since we already checked the operator\n\nputs \"Unexpected error with operator.\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\nFinally, print the result:\n\nputs \"#{num1} #{ARGV[1]} #{num2} = #{result}\"\n\nI think that covers the basic functionality. Now, I'll write the actual Ruby code based on this logic.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in Ruby that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can follow the steps below. This calculator will take two numbers and an operator as input arguments and display the result of the operation. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check the number of arguments**: Ensure exactly three arguments are provided (two numbers and one operator).\n2. **Validate and convert the numbers**: Convert the first and third arguments to floats. Handle any conversion errors.\n3. **Validate the operator**: Ensure the operator is one of the accepted ones: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.\n4. **Handle division by zero**: Check if the operator is `/` and the second number is zero.\n5. **Perform the operation**: Use a `case` statement to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation.\n6. **Display the result**: Print the result in a user-friendly format.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```ruby\n# Check if exactly three arguments are provided\nif ARGV.length != 3\n  puts \"Usage: ruby calculator.rb NUMBER OPERATOR NUMBER\"\n  puts \"Accepted operators: +, -, *, /\"\n  exit\nend\n\n# Try to convert the first and third arguments to floats\nbegin\n  num1 = Float(ARGV[0])\n  num2 = Float(ARGV[2])\nrescue ArgumentError\n  puts \"Error: Both first and third arguments must be numbers.\"\n  exit\nend\n\n# Define accepted operators\noperators = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Validate the operator\nif !operators.include?(ARGV[1])\n  puts \"Error: Invalid operator. Accepted operators are +, -, *, /.\"\n  exit\nend\n\n# Check for division by zero\nif ARGV[1] == '/' && num2 == 0\n  puts \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\"\n  exit\nend\n\n# Perform the operation based on the operator\nresult = case ARGV[1]\nwhen '+'\n  num1 + num2\nwhen '-'\n  num1 - num2\nwhen '*'\n  num1 * num2\nwhen '/'\n  num1 / num2\nelse\n  # This should never happen due to earlier validation\n  puts \"Unexpected error with operator.\"\n  exit\nend\n\n# Print the result\nputs \"#{num1} #{ARGV[1]} #{num2} = #{result}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Argument Check**: The script first checks if exactly three arguments are provided. If not, it prints a usage message and exits.\n2. **Number Conversion**: It attempts to convert the first and third arguments to floats. If conversion fails, it prints an error message and exits.\n3. **Operator Validation**: It checks if the operator is one of the accepted ones. If not, it informs the user of the valid operators and exits.\n4. **Division by Zero**: If the operator is division and the second number is zero, it prints an error message and exits.\n5. **Arithmetic Operation**: Using a `case` statement, it performs the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the operator.\n6. **Result Display**: Finally, it prints the result of the operation in a clear format.\n\nThis approach ensures that the calculator handles various edge cases gracefully and provides helpful feedback to the user."
