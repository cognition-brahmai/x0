        "content": "Let's see... There are 10 houses in the village, each with a different number of people living in them, ranging from 1 to 10. The sum of all the people in these houses is 55. I need to find out how many people live in the house with the highest number of residents.\n\nFirst, since each house has a different number of people and the numbers range from 1 to 10, it means that each house has exactly one number from 1 to 10, and no two houses have the same number of residents.\n\nSo, the numbers of people in the houses are the integers from 1 to 10, each used once.\n\nThe sum of the first 10 positive integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = (n)(n + 1)/2\n\nWhere n is the largest number in the series.\n\nIn this case, n = 10.\n\nSum = (10)(10 + 1)/2 = (10)(11)/2 = 55\n\nWait a minute, the sum is indeed 55, which matches the total given in the problem.\n\nSo, if the numbers are exactly 1 through 10, each used once, then the house with the highest number of residents would have 10 people.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure there aren't any tricks here.\n\nThe problem says \"each house has a different number of people living in it, ranging from 1 to 10.\" And the sum is 55.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that the sum of 1 through 10 is 55, it seems straightforward that the numbers are exactly 1 through 10.\n\nTherefore, the house with the highest number of residents has 10 people.\n\nI don't think there's any other way to interpret this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
