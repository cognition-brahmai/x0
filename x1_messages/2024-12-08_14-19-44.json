        "content": "The largest living land mammal is the African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Adult males can reach heights of up to 4 meters (13 feet) at the shoulder and weigh as much as 7,000 kilograms (15,432 pounds). However, it's worth noting that there is another species of elephant, the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), which is also very large but generally smaller than their African counterparts. The African elephant is distinguished by its larger size, concave back, and larger ears, which are often described as resembling the continent of Africa. Both species are intelligent and social animals, living in complex matriarchal societies."
