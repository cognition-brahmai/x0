        "content": "The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was located in what is now modern-day Turkey. Halicarnassus was an ancient city that is now known as Bodrum, a popular coastal town in southwestern Turkey. The mausoleum was built between 353 and 350 BCE by Artemisia II of Caria for her late husband, Mausolus, the ruler of Caria. It was renowned for its architectural beauty and artistic decorations, attracting visitors from all over the ancient world. Although the original structure no longer exists, its legacy lives on through the term \"mausoleum,\" which is now used to describe any above-ground tomb."
