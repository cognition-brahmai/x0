        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, total balls in the bag are 4 + 6 + 5, which is 15 balls.\n\nNow, I need to draw 3 balls from the bag without replacement, and I want to find the probability that exactly 2 of them are red and 1 is blue.\n\nOkay, first things first. Since we're drawing without replacement, the probability changes with each draw. But instead of trying to calculate it step by step for each draw, I think it's easier to use combinations here. Combinations help us figure out how many ways we can choose a certain number of items from a larger set without regard to order.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 15 is combinations of 15 taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 15 is C(15, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that: C(15, 3) = 15! / (3! * (15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455.\n\nAlright, so there are 455 different ways to draw 3 balls from 15.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to get exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThere are 4 red balls, and I need to choose 2 of them. So, the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 4 is C(4, 2).\n\nSimilarly, there are 6 blue balls, and I need to choose 1 of them. So, the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball from 6 is C(6, 1).\n\nGreen balls are there, but since I'm only interested in 2 red and 1 blue, I don't need to choose any green balls for this specific scenario.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4, 2) times C(6, 1).\n\nLet me calculate C(4, 2): C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 6.\n\nAnd C(6, 1) = 6! / (1! * (6 - 1)!) = 6 / 1 = 6.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 36 / 455.\n\nLet me see if this fraction can be simplified. Both 36 and 455 are divisible by... let's see, 36 divided by 7 is 5.14, which isn't an integer, and 455 divided by 5 is 91. Wait, maybe I can check for common factors.\n\nLet's see, 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, and 455 = 5 * 91 = 5 * 7 * 13. No common factors here. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 36/455.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider another approach to verify this.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the probability step by step, considering the draws one at a time without replacement.\n\nSo, first draw: probability of drawing a red ball. There are 4 red balls out of 15 total, so 4/15.\n\nSecond draw: now, one red ball has already been drawn, so there are 3 red balls left and 14 total balls left. So, probability of drawing another red ball is 3/14.\n\nThird draw: now, two red balls have been drawn, so there are 2 red, 6 blue, and 5 green left, totaling 13 balls. But wait, no: actually, only two red balls have been drawn, so there are still 6 blue and 5 green balls. So, total balls left are 13.\n\nBut I need exactly two red balls and one blue ball. So, the third ball should be blue.\n\nProbability of drawing a blue ball on the third draw: there are 6 blue balls left out of 13 total balls, so 6/13.\n\nSo, the probability for this specific sequence: red, red, blue is (4/15) * (3/14) * (6/13).\n\nBut wait, this is just one possible sequence. The sequence could also be red, blue, red or blue, red, red.\n\nSo, I need to consider all possible sequences that result in two reds and one blue.\n\nThere are three such sequences: RRB, RBR, BRR.\n\nEach of these sequences will have the same probability, since the individual probabilities are just rearranged in multiplication, and multiplication is commutative.\n\nSo, probability for each sequence is (4/15) * (3/14) * (6/13).\n\nLet me calculate that: (4/15) * (3/14) = (4 * 3) / (15 * 14) = 12 / 210 = 2/35.\n\nThen, (2/35) * (6/13) = 12 / 455.\n\nSo, each sequence has a probability of 12/455.\n\nSince there are three such sequences, total probability is 3 * (12/455) = 36/455.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier using combinations.\n\nSo, that's a good check.\n\nAlternatively, if I had considered the general formula for hypergeometric distribution, which is used for calculating probabilities when sampling without replacement, the formula is:\n\nProbability = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (total balls: 15)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (red balls: 4)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red balls)\n\nBut wait, in this case, I have two types of successful outcomes: red and blue. So, maybe hypergeometric distribution for multiple types.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as first choosing the red balls and then the blue ball separately.\n\nBut I think the way I did it initially with combinations is correct.\n\nSo, bottom line, the probability is 36/455.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n36 divided by 455 is approximately 0.0791, or about 7.91%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 7.91% chance of drawing exactly two red balls and one blue ball when drawing three balls without replacement from this bag.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I try to use permutations instead of combinations.\n\nSo, total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 15 is P(15, 3) = 15 * 14 * 13 = 2730.\n\nNumber of ways to draw 2 red and 1 blue: first, choose 2 reds and 1 blue, and consider the order.\n\nSo, for RRB: 4 choices for first red, 3 for second red, and 6 for blue. So, 4 * 3 * 6 = 72.\n\nSimilarly, RBR: 4 * 6 * 3 = 72.\n\nAnd BRR: 6 * 4 * 3 = 72.\n\nSo, total number of favorable permutations is 72 * 3 = 216.\n\nThen, probability is 216 / 2730.\n\nLet me simplify that: 216 \u00f7 6 = 36, 2730 \u00f7 6 = 455. So, 36/455.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I end up with 36/455.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that this is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{36}{455}} \\]"
