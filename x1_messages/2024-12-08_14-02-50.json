Each tool will produce an evidence value, which can be used as input for subsequent steps.\n\nHere are the tools that can be called:\n\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that uses a search engine to find information on the web. The output is a list of websites that may contain the answer to the question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from one or more websites provided in the input string (newline separated links). \nLinkParser[input]: Parses plain text and produces a newline-separated list of URLs.\nAIAnswerer[input]: An AI model capable of answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must reference an #E[n] variable, e.g., \"What color is the cat, given #E1?\"\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action]\n#E0 = [function with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action, based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function with input parameter, possibly referencing previous evidence like \"#E0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [#En]\n\nQuestion: What is the current population of Tokyo and what are some famous landmarks there?"

I think the best way to start is by searching the web for the latest population data of Tokyo. I can use the WebSearch tool for that.\n\nSo, first step:\n\nPlan: Search the web for the current population of Tokyo.\n\n#E0 = WebSearch[\"current population of Tokyo\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I'll need to extract the relevant information from those web pages. Maybe there are some official statistics or recent reports that can give me accurate data.\n\nNext step:\n\nPlan: Extract text from the top search results to find the population figure.\n\n#E1 = TextExtractor[#E0]\n\nNow, with the extracted text, I need to look for numbers that represent the population. It should be a large number, probably in millions, and it should be labeled as the current population.\n\nPerhaps I can use the AIAnswerer to parse this information from the text.\n\nPlan: Use AIAnswerer to find the current population from the extracted text.\n\n#E2 = AIAnswerer[\"What is the current population of Tokyo, given #E1?\"]\n\nAlright, that should give me the population figure. Now, for the famous landmarks in Tokyo. I can probably find a list of famous tourist spots or historic sites in Tokyo. Maybe I can search the web again for \"famous landmarks in Tokyo.\"\n\nPlan: Search the web for famous landmarks in Tokyo.\n\n#E3 = WebSearch[\"famous landmarks in Tokyo\"]\n\nThen, extract the text from those search results to get the names of the landmarks.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the top search results for landmarks.\n\n#E4 = TextExtractor[#E3]\n\nNow, I need to parse this text to find the names of the landmarks. Maybe list them out.\n\nPlan: Use AIAnswerer to list famous landmarks in Tokyo from the extracted text.\n\n#E5 = AIAnswerer[\"List some famous landmarks in Tokyo, given #E4.\"]\n\nFinally, I can compile both pieces of information: the population and the landmarks.\n\nPlan: Combine the population and landmarks information.\n\n#E6 = AIAnswerer[\"Provide the current population of Tokyo and some famous landmarks there, using #E2 and #E5.\"]\n\nSo, the final answer would be #E6.\n\n**Final Answer: #E6**"
