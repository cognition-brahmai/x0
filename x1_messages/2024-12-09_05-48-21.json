        "content": "So there are 100 apples on a table. I take away 50 apples, and then my friend takes away 25 apples. To find out how many apples are left, I need to subtract the apples that were taken away from the total number.\n\nFirst, starting with 100 apples, if I take away 50, that leaves 100 - 50 = 50 apples.\n\nThen, my friend takes away 25 apples from the remaining 50, so 50 - 25 = 25 apples.\n\nTherefore, there are 25 apples left on the table.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this again. The problem says that both I and my friend take away apples, but it doesn't specify if we are taking them at the same time or one after the other. Does the order matter here?\n\nIn this case, since it's specified that I take away 50 apples first and then my friend takes away 25, the order is sequential. So, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to add up the apples taken away and subtract that total from the original amount.\n\nI took 50 apples, and my friend took 25 apples, so together we took 50 + 25 = 75 apples.\n\nSubtracting that from the original 100 apples: 100 - 75 = 25 apples left.\n\nThis confirms the initial calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nIs there a possibility that some apples are being replaced or added back to the table after they're taken away? The problem doesn't mention that, so we can assume that once apples are taken away, they're gone from the table.\n\nAlso, the problem states that there are 100 apples on the table initially, and then two people take away apples. It's a straightforward subtraction problem.\n\nAnother angle to consider: are there any apples that neither I nor my friend took, perhaps because they're reserved or damaged? The problem doesn't indicate any such conditions, so we should assume all apples are available to be taken.\n\nAdditionally, the problem specifies that my friend takes away 25 apples after I've already taken 50. If there was any restriction on how many apples could be taken, it would have been mentioned. Since there isn't, we can proceed with the straightforward subtraction.\n\nLet me also consider if the apples are being taken in any particular way that might affect the count. For example, are the apples being taken one by one, or in groups? Is there any pattern to how they're being taken? The problem doesn't provide such details, so we assume that the quantities given are exact.\n\nFurthermore, the problem doesn't mention any other people or actions affecting the apples on the table, so we don't need to account for any additional changes.\n\nIn conclusion, starting with 100 apples, after I take 50 and my friend takes 25, there are 25 apples left on the table.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
