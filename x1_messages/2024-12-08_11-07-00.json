        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a round-robin tournament where every player plays every other player exactly once, and there were a total of 45 games played. We need to figure out how many players participated in this tournament.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a round-robin tournament, the number of games can be calculated using combinations. Specifically, if there are \\( n \\) players, the number of games is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\), which is equal to \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\). This makes sense because each game is a unique pair of players.\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nI need to solve for \\( n \\). Let's manipulate this equation to find \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\nn(n-1) = 90\n\\]\n\nNow, expand the left side:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - n - 90 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the standard form \\( n^2 - n - 90 = 0 \\). I can solve this using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -1 \\), and \\( c = -90 \\). Plugging these values in:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 360}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{361}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm 19}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two potential solutions:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1 + 19}{2} = 10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\frac{1 - 19}{2} = -9\n\\]\n\nSince the number of players can't be negative, we discard \\( n = -9 \\). Therefore, \\( n = 10 \\) is the solution.\n\nBut wait, let's verify this. If there are 10 players, the number of games should be \\( \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45 \\), which matches the given number of games. So, this seems correct.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there could be other interpretations or potential mistakes in this approach.\n\nAlternative Approach 1: Considering Byes\n\nIn some round-robin tournaments, especially in scheduling, a \"bye\" is given, which means a player gets a automatic win or rest. But in the standard definition, every player plays every other player exactly once, so byes aren't typically factored in unless specified. Since the problem doesn't mention byes, I'll stick with the initial approach.\n\nAlternative Approach 2: Different Game Structures\n\nMaybe the games were played in a different structure, like some players playing more games than others. But the problem specifically states that every player plays every other player exactly once, so this shouldn't be the case.\n\nAlternative Approach 3: Players Dropping Out\n\nIf some players dropped out after some games, it could affect the total number of games. However, the problem says \"every player plays every other player exactly once,\" implying that all players completed their scheduled games. So, this doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternative Approach 4: Mistake in Calculation\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. Starting from \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 45 \\), multiplying both sides by 2 gives \\( n(n-1) = 90 \\). Then, forming the quadratic equation \\( n^2 - n - 90 = 0 \\), and solving it gives \\( n = 10 \\) or \\( n = -9 \\). Again, \\( n = 10 \\) is the valid solution.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out possible values of \\( n \\) and see which one gives 45 games.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If \\( n = 9 \\), \\( \\binom{9}{2} = 36 \\), which is less than 45.\n\n- If \\( n = 10 \\), \\( \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\), which matches.\n\n- If \\( n = 11 \\), \\( \\binom{11}{2} = 55 \\), which is more than 45.\n\nSo, \\( n = 10 \\) is the only integer value that satisfies the equation.\n\nAlternative Approach 5: Graph Theory Interpretation\n\nIn graph theory, a round-robin tournament can be represented by a complete graph where each vertex is a player and each edge is a game played between two players. The number of edges in a complete graph with \\( n \\) vertices is \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\), which again brings us back to the same equation.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, it seems that \\( n = 10 \\) is the correct number of players.\n\nPotential Answer 1: 10 players\n\nThis is based on the standard combination formula for round-robin tournaments, which directly solves to \\( n = 10 \\).\n\nPotential Answer 2: 9 players\n\nIf there was a mistake in counting or if some games were not played, but the problem states that every player played every other player exactly once, so this seems unlikely.\n\nPotential Answer 3: 11 players\n\nThis would result in 55 games, which is more than the 45 played, so it doesn't fit the given information.\n\nRanking the Answers:\n\n1. 10 players: This is the most feasible answer based on the standard combination formula and direct calculation. It perfectly matches the given number of games (45).\n\n2. 9 players: This would result in only 36 games, which is less than 45, so it doesn't fit the scenario described.\n\n3. 11 players: This would result in 55 games, which is more than 45, so it also doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the most feasible answer is that there were 10 players in the tournament.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
