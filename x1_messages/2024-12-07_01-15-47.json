Currently, the ED has 10 doctors working 12-hour shifts, with an average of 5 patients per hour. The hospital administration believes that increasing the number of doctors on duty will decrease patient waiting times. Calculate how many additional doctors are needed to reduce the average waiting time by half, assuming each doctor can handle the same workload. Describe your approach to solving this problem."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional doctors are required to reduce the average patient waiting time by half in the hospital's emergency department (ED). Let's break down the problem and approach it step by step.\n\n### Given Data:\n- Current number of doctors: 10\n- Each doctor works 12-hour shifts\n- Average patients per hour: 5\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. Each doctor can handle the same workload.\n2. Increasing the number of doctors will directly reduce the waiting time.\n3. The arrival rate of patients is constant at 5 patients per hour.\n\n### Objective:\nReduce the average waiting time by half.\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Current System:**\n   - Calculate the current total patient arrival rate.\n   - Determine the current system's capacity in terms of patients per hour.\n\n2. **Determine the Required Capacity:**\n   - Since we want to reduce waiting time by half, we need to double the system's capacity.\n\n3. **Calculate the Additional Doctors Needed:**\n   - Find out how many more doctors are required to achieve the increased capacity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the Current Total Patient Arrival Rate\n- Patients per hour: 5\n- Since the doctors work 12-hour shifts, the total number of patients per shift is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ patients/hour} \\times 12 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ patients/shift}\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the Current System's Capacity\n- Each doctor works 12-hour shifts.\n- Assuming each doctor can handle a certain number of patients per hour, we need to find this rate.\n\nFirst, let's find the total patient handling capacity with 10 doctors.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- \\( \\lambda \\) = arrival rate = 5 patients/hour\n- \\( \\mu \\) = service rate per doctor (patients per hour)\n- \\( c \\) = number of doctors = 10\n\nIn queueing theory, for an M/M/c queue (Markovian arrival and service times with c servers), the average waiting time \\( W \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{1}{\\mu c - \\lambda} \\times \\frac{\\rho^c}{c!(1 - \\rho)} \\times P_0\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu c} \\) (traffic intensity)\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the probability that there are zero customers in the system.\n\nHowever, this formula is complex, and solving it directly might not be straightforward without knowing \\( \\mu \\).\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system \\( L \\) is equal to the arrival rate \\( \\lambda \\) multiplied by the average time spent in the system \\( W \\):\n\n\\[\nL = \\lambda W\n\\]\n\nBut to relate this directly to the number of doctors, we can consider that the total service rate of the system is \\( c \\times \\mu \\).\n\nTo reduce the waiting time by half, we need to double the system's service rate.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the Required Capacity\n\nIf the current service rate is \\( c \\times \\mu = 10 \\times \\mu \\), to halve the waiting time, we need to double the service rate to \\( 20 \\times \\mu \\).\n\nThis implies we need \\( c' = 20 \\) doctors.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate the Additional Doctors Needed\n\nAdditional doctors needed:\n\n\\[\nc' - c = 20 - 10 = 10\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]\n\n### Explanation:\n\nBy doubling the number of doctors from 10 to 20, the system's service rate doubles, which should halve the average waiting time for patients, assuming patient arrival rates remain constant and each doctor handles patients at the same rate. This approach simplifies the problem by directly relating the service capacity to the number of doctors, based on the principle that doubling capacity halves waiting times, under the given assumptions."
