        "content": "Let's see. So, the car is traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for a total time of 2 hours and 30 minutes. I need to find out how far it has traveled.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the time into hours since the speed is in miles per hour. 2 hours and 30 minutes\u2014well, 30 minutes is half an hour, so that would be 2.5 hours in total.\n\nNow, the formula for distance when speed is constant is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that. 60 multiplied by 2.5.\n\n60 times 2 is 120, and 60 times 0.5 is 30, so altogether that's 150 miles.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. 60 miles per hour means that for every hour, the car travels 60 miles. So in 2 hours, it would travel 120 miles, and in half an hour, it would travel half of 60 miles, which is 30 miles. So, 120 plus 30 equals 150 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the time into minutes. 2 hours and 30 minutes is 150 minutes. Then, since the speed is 60 miles per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, that means the car travels 1 mile per minute.\n\nSo, at 1 mile per minute, in 150 minutes, the car would travel 150 miles.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, the distance traveled is 150 miles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the formula for constant speed in terms of feet per second or something, but that seems unnecessary here since the units are already consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times time + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{acceleration} \\times time^2 \\]\n\nBut since the speed is constant, the acceleration is zero, so that term vanishes, and I'm back to the original formula.\n\nSo, no need to complicate it further. The answer should be 150 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
