        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a city with 500,000 people. First, we need to find out how many of these people own a car. The problem says that 60% of the people own a car. So, to find the number of car owners, I'll multiply the total population by 60%.\n\nNumber of car owners = 500,000 * 60% = 500,000 * 0.6 = 300,000\n\nAlright, so there are 300,000 car owners in the city. Now, each car owner has an average of 1.5 cars. To find the total number of cars, I need to multiply the number of car owners by the average number of cars per owner.\n\nTotal cars = 300,000 * 1.5\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n300,000 * 1.5 = 450,000\n\nSo, there are approximately 450,000 cars owned by people in this city.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"each car owner has an average of 1.5 cars.\" Does that mean that some people own more than one car? Yes, that makes sense. So, the average is 1.5, which means some might own one car, some two, and so on.\n\nBut, since we're dealing with averages, multiplying the number of car owners by the average number of cars per owner should give us the total number of cars. So, 300,000 owners times 1.5 cars each equals 450,000 cars.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, finding the number of car owners:\n\n500,000 people * 60% = 500,000 * 0.6 = 300,000 car owners\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, total cars:\n\n300,000 car owners * 1.5 cars per owner = 450,000 cars\n\nYes, that looks right.\n\nSo, the total number of cars owned by people in the city is approximately 450,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450000} \\]"
