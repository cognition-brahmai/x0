        "content": "So the theme park is planning to build a new roller coaster that's 200 feet tall with a track that's 5,000 feet long. The construction is going to cost $20 million, and they think that this new attraction will bring in an extra 500,000 visitors each year. The average ticket price is $75, and we need to figure out how much more money the park will make each year from these additional visitors and then see how many years it will take to earn back the $20 million they spent on the roller coaster.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the increase in annual revenue from ticket sales. To do that, I'll multiply the number of additional visitors by the average ticket price. So, that's 500,000 visitors times $75 per ticket.\n\n500,000 visitors * $75/ticket = $37,500,000\n\nSo, the park expects to make an additional $37.5 million each year from ticket sales because of the new roller coaster.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many years it will take to recoup the $20 million investment. To do this, I'll divide the construction cost by the annual increase in revenue.\n\n$20,000,000 / $37,500,000 per year = approximately 0.5333 years\n\nBut 0.5333 years is a bit less intuitive, so I'll convert that into months to make it clearer. There are 12 months in a year, so:\n\n0.5333 years * 12 months/year \u2248 6.4 months\n\nSo, it would take a little over 6 months to earn back the $20 million investment.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too good to be true. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, the additional revenue per year is indeed $37.5 million. But the construction cost is $20 million. So, dividing $20 million by $37.5 million gives approximately 0.5333 years, which is about 6.4 months.\n\nHowever, in real life, there are other costs to consider besides just the construction cost, like operating costs, maintenance, staffing, etc. But according to the problem, we're only considering the construction cost and the additional revenue from ticket sales, assuming no other expenses.\n\nSo, based on these numbers, the park would recoup its investment in a little over 6 months.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe the park has to pay for tickets for the additional visitors, or there are variable costs per visitor. But the problem doesn't mention any such costs, so I'll assume that the additional revenue is pure profit, which seems unlikely in reality, but according to the problem, that's the case.\n\nTherefore, the park can expect to make an additional $37.5 million per year from the new roller coaster and will recoup the $20 million construction cost in about 6.4 months.\n\nI think that's the answer, but it does seem unusually quick. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try another approach. If the park makes an additional $37.5 million per year, then in one year, they would make $37.5 million, which is more than the $20 million cost. So, yes, in less than a year, they would recover the cost.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of how many months it takes to make $20 million if they're making $37.5 million per year.\n\nFirst, find the monthly additional revenue:\n\n$37,500,000 / 12 months = $3,125,000 per month\n\nThen, divide the construction cost by the monthly additional revenue:\n\n$20,000,000 / $3,125,000/month = 6.4 months\n\nSame result as before.\n\nSo, it seems consistent. Perhaps the park is expecting a very high number of additional visitors or a very high ticket price, which is why the payback period is so short.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the construction cost is relatively low compared to the expected additional revenue.\n\nBut according to the numbers provided, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the increase in annual revenue from ticket sales is $37.5 million, and it would take approximately 6.4 months to recoup the $20 million investment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe increase in annual revenue from ticket sales is $\\boxed{37500000}$ dollars, and it would take approximately $\\boxed{6.4}$ months to recoup the investment."
