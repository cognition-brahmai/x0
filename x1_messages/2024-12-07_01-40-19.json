        "content": "To create a Python script that connects to a PostgreSQL database, creates a table named \"users\" with columns for id, name, and email, and inserts three sample records into the table, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install the necessary library**: You'll need the `psycopg2` library to connect to the PostgreSQL database from Python. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2\n   ```\n\n2. **Write the Python script**: Below is a sample script that performs the required tasks. Make sure to replace the connection parameters (`database`, `user`, `password`, `host`, `port`) with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials.\n\n   ```python\n   import psycopg2\n\n   # Connection parameters\n   dbname = \"your_database_name\"\n   user = \"your_username\"\n   password = \"your_password\"\n   host = \"localhost\"  # or your host address\n   port = \"5432\"  # default PostgreSQL port\n\n   # Connect to the PostgreSQL database\n   conn = psycopg2.connect(dbname=dbname, user=user, password=password, host=host, port=port)\n\n   # Create a cursor object\n   cur = conn.cursor()\n\n   # Create the users table\n   cur.execute(\"\"\"\n   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n       name VARCHAR(100),\n       email VARCHAR(100)\n   )\n   \"\"\")\n\n   # Insert three sample records\n   sample_users = [\n       (\"Alice\", \"alice@example.com\"),\n       (\"Bob\", \"bob@example.com\"),\n       (\"Charlie\", \"charlie@example.com\")\n   ]\n\n   for user in sample_users:\n       cur.execute(\"INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (%s, %s)\", user)\n\n   # Commit the changes\n   conn.commit()\n\n   # Close the cursor and connection\n   cur.close()\n   conn.close()\n\n   print(\"Table created and sample data inserted successfully.\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the script**: Execute the script in your Python environment. If everything is set up correctly, it will connect to your PostgreSQL database, create the \"users\" table if it doesn't exist, and insert the three sample records.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Connecting to the Database**: The `psycopg2.connect` function is used to establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the provided credentials.\n\n- **Creating the Table**: The `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` SQL statement is used to create the \"users\" table with columns for id, name, and email. The `id` column is set as a serial primary key, which means it will auto-increment.\n\n- **Inserting Data**: Sample user data is inserted into the table using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The `INSERT INTO` statement is executed for each sample user.\n\n- **Committing Changes**: The `conn.commit()` method is called to save the changes made to the database.\n\n- **Closing Connections**: It's important to close the cursor and the connection to free up resources.\n\nMake sure your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible with the provided credentials. If you're using a different host or port, adjust the connection parameters accordingly."
