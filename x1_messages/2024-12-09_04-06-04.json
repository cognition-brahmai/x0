        "content": "No, shaving does not make hair grow back thicker or darker. This is a common myth, but it's not based on scientific fact.\n\nWhen you shave your hair, you're cutting it at the surface of the skin. The hair that grows back will have a blunt tip, which might make it feel coarser or thicker, but the actual diameter of the hair remains the same.\n\nThe color of the hair also doesn't change due to shaving. Hair color is determined by melanin production in the hair follicle, which isn't affected by shaving.\n\nSo, don't worry about shaving making your hair thicker or darker. It's just a temporary change in how the hair feels due to the shape of the cut end."
