        "content": "Sure! To create a Python script that connects to a MongoDB database, reads data from a collection, performs some basic aggregation operations, and outputs the results in a human-readable format, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Required Packages**: Ensure you have `pymongo` installed, which is the official Python driver for MongoDB.\n\n2. **Connect to MongoDB**: Use `pymongo` to connect to your MongoDB database.\n\n3. **Read Data**: Access the collection from which you want to read data.\n\n4. **Perform Aggregation Operations**: Use aggregation pipelines to perform operations like count, sum, and average.\n\n5. **Output Results**: Print the results in a readable format.\n\nBelow is a sample script that demonstrates these steps. For this example, let's assume we have a database named `sample_db` and a collection named `orders`. Each document in the `orders` collection has fields like `order_id`, `amount`, and `status`.\n\n### Sample Script\n\n```python\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n# Step 1: Connect to MongoDB\nclient = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\ndb = client['sample_db']\ncollection = db['orders']\n\n# Step 2: Perform aggregation operations\n\n# Count the total number of documents in the collection\ntotal_count = collection.count_documents({})\n\n# Sum of all amounts\ntotal_amount = collection.aggregate([{\"$group\": {\"_id\": None, \"total\": {\"$sum\": \"$amount\"}}}])\n\n# Average amount\naverage_amount = collection.aggregate([{\"$group\": {\"_id\": None, \"average\": {\"$avg\": \"$amount\"}}}])\n\n# Count of orders by status\nstatus_counts = collection.aggregate([{\"$group\": {\"_id\": \"$status\", \"count\": {\"$sum\": 1}}}])\n\n# Step 3: Output the results\n\nprint(f\"Total number of orders: {total_count}\")\n\nfor result in total_amount:\n    print(f\"Total amount: {result['total']}\")\n\nfor result in average_amount:\n    print(f\"Average amount: {result['average']}\")\n\nprint(\"Order counts by status:\")\nfor result in status_counts:\n    print(f\"Status: {result['_id']}, Count: {result['count']}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Connecting to MongoDB**: We use `MongoClient` to connect to the MongoDB instance running on `localhost` at port `27017`. Replace the connection string if your MongoDB is hosted elsewhere.\n\n2. **Accessing the Collection**: We access the `orders` collection in the `sample_db` database.\n\n3. **Aggregation Operations**:\n   - **Count**: `count_documents({})` counts all documents in the collection.\n   - **Sum**: Using an aggregation pipeline, we sum up the `amount` field.\n   - **Average**: Again, using an aggregation pipeline, we calculate the average of the `amount` field.\n   - **Group by Status**: We group documents by the `status` field and count the number of documents in each group.\n\n4. **Output Results**: We print the results in a readable format.\n\nMake sure to install `pymongo` using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```sh\npip install pymongo\n```\n\nThis script provides a basic framework. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to adjust the database name, collection name, and field names accordingly."
