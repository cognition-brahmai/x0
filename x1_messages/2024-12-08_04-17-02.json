        "content": "The French word for a small appetizer typically served before a meal is \"l'ap\u00e9ritif\" or more commonly, \"l'ap\u00e9ro.\" However, if you're referring to the actual small bites served during l'ap\u00e9ro, those are often called \"les amuse-gueules\" or \"les starters.\" But the term most directly related to a small appetizer is \"l'entr\u00e9e,\" although in some regions, \"l'entr\u00e9e\" can refer to the first course of a meal. To avoid confusion, it's sometimes better to use \"l'amicale\" or \"l'ouverture\" for appetizers. But in everyday language, people often use \"l'ap\u00e9ro\" to refer to both the drinks and the small bites served before a meal."
