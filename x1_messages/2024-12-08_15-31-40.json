        "content": "So I've got this problem here about two departments in a company, and I need to find the combined average number of hours worked per employee in both departments. Let's see what I've got.\n\nDepartment A has 30 employees, and each works 40 hours per week. Department B has 25 employees, each working 35 hours per week. I need to find the average hours worked per employee when combining both departments.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the total number of hours worked in each department and then add them up. After that, I'll divide by the total number of employees in both departments to get the average.\n\nSo, for Department A:\n\nNumber of employees: 30\n\nHours per employee per week: 40\n\nTotal hours for Department A: 30 * 40 = 1200 hours\n\nFor Department B:\n\nNumber of employees: 25\n\nHours per employee per week: 35\n\nTotal hours for Department B: 25 * 35 = 875 hours\n\nNow, the combined total hours for both departments: 1200 + 875 = 2075 hours\n\nTotal number of employees in both departments: 30 + 25 = 55 employees\n\nNow, to find the average hours per employee:\n\nAverage hours = total hours / total employees = 2075 / 55\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2075 divided by 55.\n\nFirst, 55 times 37 is 2035.\n\n2075 - 2035 = 40\n\nSo, 37 with a remainder of 40.\n\nNow, 40 divided by 55 is approximately 0.727\n\nSo, 37 + 0.727 = 37.727 hours\n\nBut maybe I should be more precise. Let me use a calculator for this.\n\n2075 \u00f7 55 = 37.727272...\n\nSo, approximately 37.73 hours per employee.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if this is the correct way to find the average.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the weighted average.\n\nThe weighted average takes into account the number of employees in each department.\n\nSo, the formula for weighted average is:\n\n(WA) = (sum of (number of employees * hours per employee)) / total number of employees\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, WA = (30*40 + 25*35) / (30 + 25) = (1200 + 875) / 55 = 2075 / 55 = 37.7272...\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to find the average differently, say, averaging the two department's hours directly, that would be incorrect because the departments have different numbers of employees.\n\nFor example, if I just average 40 and 35, that's 37.5, but that doesn't account for the fact that Department A has more employees than Department B.\n\nSo, the weighted average is the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of proportions.\n\nDepartment A has 30 out of 55 employees, which is 30/55 = 6/11\n\nDepartment B has 25 out of 55, which is 25/55 = 5/11\n\nSo, the average would be:\n\n(6/11)*40 + (5/11)*35\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, (6/11)*40 = 240/11 = approximately 21.818\n\n(5/11)*35 = 175/11 = approximately 15.909\n\nAdd them up: 21.818 + 15.909 = 37.727\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, that's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of total hours and total employees, which is what I did first.\n\nNow, another way to think about it is to find the total hours worked by all employees and divide by the total number of employees.\n\nThat's essentially the same as the weighted average.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I arrive at approximately 37.73 hours per employee.\n\nBut maybe I should express it in a fraction or more precisely.\n\n2075 divided by 55.\n\nLet me see:\n\n55 * 37 = 2035\n\n2075 - 2035 = 40\n\nSo, 37 and 40/55 hours.\n\nSimplify 40/55:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 8/11\n\nSo, 37 and 8/11 hours.\n\nIf I want to convert 8/11 to a decimal:\n\n8 \u00f7 11 = 0.7272...\n\nSo, 37.7272... hours\n\nRounded to two decimal places, 37.73 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if the question prefers hours and minutes, I could convert the decimal part to minutes.\n\n0.7272 * 60 minutes \u2248 43.63 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 37 hours and 44 minutes.\n\nBut since the question asks for the average number of hours, I think 37.73 hours is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if it needs to be in fraction, 37 8/11 hours.\n\nBut probably decimal is fine.\n\nSo, the combined average number of hours worked per employee in both departments is approximately 37.73 hours per week.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37.73} \\]"
