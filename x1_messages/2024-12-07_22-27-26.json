        "content": "So I've got this problem about a rectangular garden. It says that the length is 4 meters longer than the width, and the area is 240 square meters. I need to find the dimensions, which means finding both the length and the width. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, area = length \u00d7 width. That's a starting point.\n\nNow, the problem gives me a relationship between the length and the width: the length is 4 meters longer than the width. So, if I let the width be something, say, W meters, then the length would be W + 4 meters.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Width = W meters\n- Length = W + 4 meters\n- Area = 240 square meters\n\nUsing the area formula:\n\nArea = Length \u00d7 Width\n\nSo,\n\n240 = (W + 4) \u00d7 W\n\nNow, I have an equation here: 240 = (W + 4)W\n\nI need to solve for W. Let's expand the right side:\n\n240 = W\u00b2 + 4W\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. To solve it, I should set it to zero. So, let's move all terms to one side:\n\nW\u00b2 + 4W - 240 = 0\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation: W\u00b2 + 4W - 240 = 0\n\nI can solve this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. I'll try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -240 and add up to 4. Let's think:\n\nPossible factor pairs of -240:\n\n- 1 and -240\n- 2 and -120\n- 3 and -80\n- 4 and -60\n- 5 and -48\n- 6 and -40\n- 8 and -30\n- 10 and -24\n- 12 and -20\n- 15 and -16\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -240 and add up to 4.\n\nLet's see: 15 and -16 multiply to -240 and add up to -1. Not quite.\n\n16 and -15 multiply to -240 and add up to 1. Close, but not 4.\n\nWait, maybe 20 and -12:\n\n20 \u00d7 -12 = -240\n\n20 + (-12) = 8. Not 4.\n\nHow about 24 and -10:\n\n24 \u00d7 -10 = -240\n\n24 + (-10) = 14. Still not 4.\n\n18 and -13.2:\n\n18 \u00d7 -13.2 = -240 (but 18 -13.2 is 4.8). Not exact.\n\nHmm, maybe I should try another method. Maybe completing the square or using the quadratic formula.\n\nQuadratic formula is given by:\n\nW = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nFor the equation W\u00b2 + 4W - 240 = 0, the coefficients are:\n\na = 1, b = 4, c = -240\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nW = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(4\u00b2 - 4(1)(-240))] / (2*1)\n\nW = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 960)] / 2\n\nW = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(976)] / 2\n\nHmm, sqrt(976). That seems a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify sqrt(976).\n\n976 divided by 16 is 61, since 16 \u00d7 61 = 976.\n\nSo, sqrt(976) = sqrt(16 \u00d7 61) = 4\u221a61\n\nSo, W = [-4 \u00b1 4\u221a61] / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\nW = [-4 + 4\u221a61]/2 or W = [-4 - 4\u221a61]/2\n\nW = [-4 + 4\u221a61]/2 = -2 + 2\u221a61\n\nW = [-4 - 4\u221a61]/2 = -2 - 2\u221a61\n\nNow, since width can't be negative, I'll discard the negative solution.\n\nSo, W = -2 + 2\u221a61\n\nHmm, that's an irrational number. Maybe I should check if there's a simpler way or if I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can factor the quadratic differently.\n\nLet me try factoring by grouping.\n\nStarting with W\u00b2 + 4W - 240 = 0\n\nI need to find two numbers that multiply to (1)(-240) = -240 and add to 4.\n\nAs before, I'm having trouble finding integers that fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can complete the square.\n\nStarting with W\u00b2 + 4W = 240\n\nTo complete the square, take half of the coefficient of W, which is 4, half is 2, then square it to get 4.\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\nW\u00b2 + 4W + 4 = 240 + 4\n\nW\u00b2 + 4W + 4 = 244\n\nNow, the left side is a perfect square:\n\n(W + 2)\u00b2 = 244\n\nTake square root of both sides:\n\nW + 2 = \u00b1\u221a244\n\nW = -2 \u00b1 \u221a244\n\nAgain, width can't be negative, so W = -2 + \u221a244\n\nSimplify \u221a244:\n\n244 = 4 \u00d7 61, so \u221a244 = \u221a(4\u00d761) = 2\u221a61\n\nSo, W = -2 + 2\u221a61\n\nThat seems consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nBut this doesn't look very clean. Maybe there's a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me double-check the problem.\n\n\" A rectangular garden has a length that is 4 meters longer than its width. If the area of the garden is 240 square meters, what are the dimensions of the garden?\"\n\nSo, area = length \u00d7 width = 240\n\nLength = width + 4\n\nSo, (W + 4)W = 240\n\nWhich leads to W\u00b2 + 4W - 240 = 0\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to guess and check.\n\nThink of possible widths that, when multiplied by a length 4 meters longer, give 240.\n\nLet's try W = 10:\n\nLength = 14\n\n10 \u00d7 14 = 140. Too low.\n\nW = 15:\n\nLength = 19\n\n15 \u00d7 19 = 285. Too high.\n\nW = 12:\n\nLength = 16\n\n12 \u00d7 16 = 192. Still low.\n\nW = 14:\n\nLength = 18\n\n14 \u00d7 18 = 252. Close, still a bit high.\n\nW = 13:\n\nLength = 17\n\n13 \u00d7 17 = 221. Still low.\n\nW = 14.5:\n\nLength = 18.5\n\n14.5 \u00d7 18.5 = let's see... 14.5 \u00d7 18.5.\n\n14.5 \u00d7 18 = 261\n\nPlus 14.5 \u00d7 0.5 = 7.25\n\nTotal 261 + 7.25 = 268.25. Still high.\n\nThis guessing isn't getting me closer quickly.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the quadratic solution.\n\nW = -2 + 2\u221a61\n\nLet's calculate \u221a61.\n\n61 is between 49 and 64, so \u221a61 is between 7 and 8.\n\nActually, 7.5\u00b2 = 56.25\n\n7.8\u00b2 = 60.84\n\n7.9\u00b2 = 62.41\n\n7.84\u00b2 = let's see, 7.84 \u00d7 7.84.\n\n7\u00d77 = 49\n\n7\u00d70.84 = 5.88, so 49 + 5.88 = 54.88\n\nThen, 0.84\u00d70.84 = 0.7056\n\nTotal: 54.88 + 0.7056 = 55.5856. Not 61.\n\nWait, maybe 7.81\u00b2:\n\n7\u00d77 = 49\n\n7\u00d70.81 = 5.67\n\n0.81\u00d70.81 = 0.6561\n\nTotal: 49 + 5.67 = 54.67 + 0.6561 = 55.3261. Still low.\n\n7.85\u00b2:\n\n7\u00d77 = 49\n\n7\u00d70.85 = 5.95\n\n0.85\u00d70.85 = 0.7225\n\nTotal: 49 + 5.95 = 54.95 + 0.7225 = 55.6725\n\nStill low.\n\n7.9\u00b2 = 62.41, which is higher than 61.\n\nSo, \u221a61 is between 7.8 and 7.9.\n\nLet's approximate \u221a61 \u2248 7.81\n\nThen, W = -2 + 2(7.81) = -2 + 15.62 = 13.62 meters\n\nThen, Length = W + 4 = 13.62 + 4 = 17.62 meters\n\nLet's check the area: 13.62 \u00d7 17.62 \u2248 240.\n\nCalculate: 13.62 \u00d7 17.62.\n\nFirst, 13.62 \u00d7 17 = 231.54\n\n13.62 \u00d7 0.62 = approximately 8.44\n\nTotal: 231.54 + 8.44 = 240 meters squared.\n\nThat checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to solve this without getting into decimals.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor the quadratic differently.\n\nLet me try factoring W\u00b2 + 4W - 240 = 0\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -240 and add to 4.\n\nLet's list factor pairs of 240:\n\n1 and 240\n\n2 and 120\n\n3 and 80\n\n4 and 60\n\n5 and 48\n\n6 and 40\n\n8 and 30\n\n10 and 24\n\n12 and 20\n\n15 and 16\n\nNow, considering the signs, I need one positive and one negative to multiply to -240 and add to 4.\n\nLet's try 20 and -12:\n\n20 \u00d7 -12 = -240\n\n20 + (-12) = 8. Not 4.\n\n16 and -15:\n\n16 \u00d7 -15 = -240\n\n16 + (-15) = 1. Not 4.\n\n18 and -13.2: Not integers.\n\nHmm, maybe factoring isn't the easiest way here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the quadratic formula more precisely.\n\nW = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 960)] / 2\n\nW = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(976)] / 2\n\nNow, sqrt(976):\n\n976 = 16 \u00d7 61\n\nSo, sqrt(976) = sqrt(16) \u00d7 sqrt(61) = 4\u221a61\n\nThus, W = [-4 \u00b1 4\u221a61]/2 = -2 \u00b1 2\u221a61\n\nAgain, W = -2 + 2\u221a61\n\nSince W must be positive, we take the positive solution.\n\nNow, to find the numerical value, we can approximate \u221a61.\n\nWe know that 7.5\u00b2 = 56.25\n\n7.8\u00b2 = 60.84\n\n7.85\u00b2 = 61.6225\n\nSo, \u221a61 is approximately 7.81\n\nThus, W \u2248 -2 + 2(7.81) = -2 + 15.62 = 13.62 meters\n\nThen, Length = W + 4 \u2248 13.62 + 4 = 17.62 meters\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the garden are approximately 13.62 meters in width and 17.62 meters in length.\n\nAlternatively, if exact values are preferred, we can express the width as W = -2 + 2\u221a61 meters, and length as L = W + 4 = 2 + 2\u221a61 meters.\n\nBut for practical purposes, the approximate values should suffice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the garden are approximately \\boxed{13.62 \\text{ meters by } 17.62 \\text{ meters}}."
