For each step, indicate the corresponding evidence value which will be the output of one of the available tools given an input string that could be the user question, one or more prior evidence values, or a mixture of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool allowing users to perform searches via DuckDuckGo search engine. It helps in identifying potential sources that might have answers to the user's query.\nSiteReader[input]: Loads one or multiple websites from the input string consisting of newline separated links. Input includes one or more links and outputs plain text comprising the content of these links.\nURLPicker[input]: Picks URLs from plain text and provides a plain text, newline-separated response of URLs.\nQAEngine[input]: A question-answering language model effective at answering queries based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a textual question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, like What is the population of Paris, given :evidence1:?\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: having the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Which company developed the Hubble Space Telescope and what were its major contributions to astronomy?"
