If a person reads 30 pages per hour for 4 hours every day, how many pages will they read in a month with 30 days?\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many pages the person reads in one day. They read 30 pages per hour for 4 hours, so that's 30 pages/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 120 pages per day.\n\nNow, to find out how many pages they read in 30 days, I'll multiply the daily reading by the number of days: 120 pages/day \u00d7 30 days = 3600 pages.\n\nSo, the person will read 3600 pages in a month with 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3600} \\]"
