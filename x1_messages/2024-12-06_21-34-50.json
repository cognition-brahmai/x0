        "content": "So there's a class with 40 students, and 60% of them are female. I need to find out how many male students there are. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many female students there are because I know the percentage. If 60% of the class are females, then I can calculate the number of female students by taking 60% of 40.\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 40 by 60% or 0.60 in decimal form. So, 40 times 0.60 equals 24. So, there are 24 female students.\n\nNow, to find the number of male students, I can subtract the number of female students from the total number of students. That is, 40 minus 24 equals 16.\n\nSo, there are 16 male students in the class.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of male students. If 60% are female, then the remaining percentage must be male. So, 100% minus 60% equals 40%. That means 40% of the class are male students.\n\nNow, I can calculate 40% of 40 to find the number of male students. 40% of 40 is 0.40 times 40, which equals 16. So, again, I get 16 male students.\n\nBoth methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like there are 16 male students in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
