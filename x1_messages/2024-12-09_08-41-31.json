        "content": "In the sullen heart of shadowed lands,\nWhere sunlight dares not pierce the verdant veil,\nA realm of mystery and darkness stands,\nWhere ancient trees in silence forever wail.\n\nBeneath the canopy, where gloom doth reign,\nThe forest breathes with life in every breath,\nYet death lurks close, in every hidden vein,\nAnd time itself seems to have lost its death.\n\nHere, in this place of eternal night,\nThe spirits of the past still linger on,\nTheir whispers carried by the misty light,\nThat shrouds the forest in a mournful tone.\n\nOh, rainforest dark, thy beauty is a curse,\nFor in thy depths, both life and death converge."
