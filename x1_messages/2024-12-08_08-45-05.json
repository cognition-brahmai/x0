        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has a total of 100 cars. Out of these, 60% are sedans, 30% are SUVs, and 10% are convertibles. I need to find out how many more sedans there are than SUVs.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of sedans. Since 60% of the cars are sedans, I can find that by taking 60% of 100 cars. That would be:\n\nNumber of sedans = 60% of 100 = 0.60 * 100 = 60 sedans\n\nNext, I'll find the number of SUVs. 30% of the cars are SUVs, so:\n\nNumber of SUVs = 30% of 100 = 0.30 * 100 = 30 SUVs\n\nNow, to find out how many more sedans there are than SUVs, I'll subtract the number of SUVs from the number of sedans:\n\nMore sedans than SUVs = Number of sedans - Number of SUVs = 60 - 30 = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 more sedans than SUVs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Percentages can sometimes be tricky. I have a total of 100 cars, which makes it straightforward because percentages directly translate to numbers. But just to be sure, let's confirm the calculations.\n\n60% of 100 is indeed 60 sedans.\n\n30% of 100 is indeed 30 SUVs.\n\nSubtracting those gives 30 more sedans than SUVs.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of ratios or fractions, but since the total is 100, it's pretty straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that sedans are twice as many as SUVs because 60 is twice 30. But the question is specifically asking for how many more sedans there are, not how many times more.\n\nSo, the answer should be 30 more sedans than SUVs.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
