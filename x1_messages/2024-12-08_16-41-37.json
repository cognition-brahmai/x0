        "content": "Let's see. So, in this classroom, there are 4 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 students in total. I need to find out how many girls and boys there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably define variables for the number of girls and boys. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys.\n\n- Since there are 4 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls would be \\( 4b \\).\n\nNow, the total number of students is the sum of the number of girls and boys, so:\n\n\\[ b + 4b = 30 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, that's:\n\n\\[ 5b = 30 \\]\n\nTo find \\( b \\), I can divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, there are 6 boys.\n\nNow, since there are 4 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 24 girls and 6 boys in the class.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 6 boys and 24 girls, that does add up to 30 students. And 24 is indeed 4 times 6, so that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this using ratios. The ratio of girls to boys is 4:1, which means for every 4 girls, there is 1 boy. So, the total parts are 4 + 1 = 5 parts.\n\nSince there are 30 students in total, each part represents \\( \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\) students.\n\nTherefore, boys are 1 part, which is 6, and girls are 4 parts, which is \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\).\n\nEither way, I end up with the same answer.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. But maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I let the number of boys be \\( b \\), and the number of girls be \\( g \\).\n\nI know that:\n\n1. \\( g = 4b \\)\n\n2. \\( g + b = 30 \\)\n\nI can substitute the first equation into the second:\n\n\\[ 4b + b = 30 \\]\n\nAgain, that's:\n\n\\[ 5b = 30 \\]\n\nSo, \\( b = 6 \\), and then \\( g = 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\).\n\nSame result.\n\nPerhaps I can use algebraic equations to confirm this.\n\nLet me set up the system of equations:\n\n\\[ \\begin{cases}\n\ng = 4b \\\\\n\ng + b = 30\n\n\n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n\n\\[ 4b + b = 30 \\]\n\n\\[ 5b = 30 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 6 \\]\n\nThen, \\( g = 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\).\n\nAlternatively, I could solve for \\( g \\) first.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( g = 4b \\).\n\nPlugging this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 4b + b = 30 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( 5b = 30 \\), so \\( b = 6 \\), and \\( g = 24 \\).\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me try another approach. What if I consider the difference between the number of girls and boys?\n\nWell, the difference is \\( g - b \\). But I don't know the difference, only the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of fractions.\n\nSince girls are 4 times the boys, the fraction of the class that is boys is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\), and girls are \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\), because \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) is 4 times \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\nSo, the fraction of boys is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the total class.\n\nTherefore, number of boys is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 30 = 6 \\).\n\nSimilarly, number of girls is \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 30 = 24 \\).\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if 24 is indeed 4 times 6.\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnd 24 plus 6 equals 30, which matches the total number of students.\n\nI can't think of any other way this could be interpreted. It seems straightforward.\n\nPerhaps the key is to identify the relationship between girls and boys and translate that into mathematical equations.\n\nIn this case, the relationship is that there are 4 times as many girls as boys, which directly translates to \\( g = 4b \\).\n\nThen, the total number of students is 30, so \\( g + b = 30 \\).\n\nSolving these two equations gives the numbers of girls and boys.\n\nThis approach can be applied to similar problems where there are proportional relationships between different groups.\n\nIt's important to define variables clearly and set up equations based on the given relationships.\n\nIn summary, there are 24 girls and 6 boys in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24 \\text{ girls and } 6 \\text{ boys}} \\]"
