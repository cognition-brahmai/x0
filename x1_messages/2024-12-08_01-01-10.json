        "content": "Well, let's think about this. I know that North America has several large cities, and some of them are capitals while others aren't. So, I need to find the most populous city that isn't a capital.\n\nFirst, what are the countries in North America? There's the United States, Canada, Mexico, and smaller countries like Belize, Guatemala, etc. But the largest populations are in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, so probably the most populous city is in one of those.\n\nIn the U.S., the capital is Washington, D.C., but it's not the most populous city. I think New York is the biggest city in the U.S. Similarly, in Canada, the capital is Ottawa, but Toronto and Montreal are larger. In Mexico, the capital is Mexico City, which I believe is the largest city in the country.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the most populous city that isn't a capital, I should compare the largest cities in these countries, excluding their capitals.\n\nLet's start with the U.S. The most populous city is New York, followed by Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, etc. None of these are capitals, since the capital is Washington, D.C.\n\nIn Canada, Toronto is the largest city, followed by Montreal, Vancouver, etc., and none of these are the capital.\n\nIn Mexico, as I mentioned, the capital is Mexico City, which is the largest city. So, the next largest city would be Guadalajara, I think.\n\nSo, now I need to compare the populations of New York (U.S.), Toronto (Canada), and Guadalajara (Mexico) to see which one is the most populous among non-capital cities.\n\nI know that New York is very large, with a population over 8 million. Toronto has around 2.9 million, and Guadalajara has about 1.5 million.\n\nSo, New York seems to be the largest among these.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are larger cities in the U.S. than New York. Let's check. Actually, New York is the largest city in the U.S., followed by Los Angeles, Chicago, etc.\n\nSo, New York is the largest non-capital city in North America.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other large cities in other North American countries that might be larger than New York but not be capitals.\n\nFor example, in Mexico, is Monterrey larger than Guadalajara? I don't think so. Monterrey has around 1.1 million, which is less than Guadalajara.\n\nIn Canada, Vancouver has around 650,000, which is still less than Toronto and way less than New York.\n\nIn the U.S., Philadelphia is next after New York, with around 1.6 million, which is still less than New York.\n\nSo, it seems that New York is the most populous city in North America that isn't the capital of its country.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that Mexico City is the capital of Mexico and is the largest city, but perhaps there are larger cities in the U.S. that aren't capitals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the population numbers I have in mind.\n\nLet me look up the population of New York and Toronto to confirm.\n\nOh, actually, the population of New York City is around 8.4 million, while Toronto has around 2.9 million, as I thought.\n\nBut perhaps if I consider the metropolitan areas, the numbers change.\n\nLet me check the metropolitan area populations.\n\nNew York metropolitan area has over 20 million people, while Toronto's metropolitan area has around 6 million, and Mexico City's metropolitan area has over 21 million.\n\nWait, but Mexico City is the capital, so it doesn't qualify.\n\nSo, in terms of metropolitan areas, Mexico City is the largest, followed by New York, then Toronto.\n\nBut the question is about cities, not metropolitan areas, and specifically non-capital cities.\n\nSo, sticking to city populations, New York is the largest non-capital city in North America.\n\nBut perhaps there are other large cities in the U.S. that I'm not considering.\n\nLet me think about it differently. What is the most populous city in North America that is not the capital of its country?\n\nFirst, list the largest cities in North America:\n\n1. Mexico City, Mexico - capital\n\n2. New York, U.S. - not capital\n\n3. Los Angeles, U.S. - not capital\n\n4. Chicago, U.S. - not capital\n\n5. Toronto, Canada - not capital\n\n6. Montreal, Canada - not capital\n\n7. Miami, U.S. - not capital\n\n8. Houston, U.S. - not capital\n\n9. Philadelphia, U.S. - not capital\n\n10. Guadalajara, Mexico - not capital\n\nFrom this list, the largest non-capital city is New York.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check the populations:\n\n- New York: 8.4 million\n\n- Los Angeles: 3.9 million\n\n- Chicago: 2.7 million\n\n- Toronto: 2.9 million\n\n- Montreal: 1.7 million\n\n- Miami: 0.4 million\n\n- Houston: 2.3 million\n\n- Philadelphia: 1.6 million\n\n- Guadalajara: 1.5 million\n\nSo, New York is clearly the largest among these.\n\nTherefore, the most populous city in North America that doesn't serve as the capital of its country is New York.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{New York}} \\]"
