        "content": "Alright, I need to figure out which function to use for this task. The user wants to know how many times the word 'sustainability' appears in a provided PDF document. So, I have two functions available: text_analysis and pdf_analytics.\n\nFirst, let's look at text_analysis. It says it's for analyzing text content in various formats, and it has parameters for action and target_word. The actions listed are count_words, sentiment_analysis, keyword_extraction, etc. Since the user wants to count the occurrences of a specific word, 'sustainability', the action that seems relevant here is 'count_words', and I can specify the target_word as 'sustainability'.\n\nOn the other hand, there's pdf_analytics, which is specifically for analyzing PDF documents. That seems directly applicable since the input is a PDF. It has parameters for action and target_word as well. The actions listed include count, filter, grouped_count, etc. Here, 'count' seems like the appropriate action to count the occurrences of the target_word, which again would be 'sustainability'.\n\nNow, I need to decide which one to choose. Since pdf_analytics is specifically designed for PDFs, and text_analysis is for various text formats, perhaps pdf_analytics is more suited for this task. But text_analysis might also be able to handle PDFs, as it mentions various formats.\n\nHowever, to cover all bases, I should consider that pdf_analytics might have features optimized for PDFs that text_analysis doesn't. So, maybe pdf_analytics is the better choice here.\n\nLet me think about this step by step:\n\n1. The input is a PDF document.\n\n2. The required operation is to count the occurrences of a specific word ('sustainability').\n\nGiven that, pdf_analytics seems directly geared towards handling PDFs, and its 'count' action appears to be what's needed.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider text_analysis:\n\n- If I use text_analysis with action: count_words and target_word: sustainability, it might work, assuming it can handle PDFs.\n\n- However, since pdf_analytics is specifically for PDFs, it might handle PDF-specific issues like formatting, embeddings, or special characters better.\n\nTherefore, I think pdf_analytics is the more appropriate choice here.\n\nSo, I'll go with pdf_analytics, set the action to 'count', and specify the target_word as 'sustainability'.\n\nI need to present this in YAML format.\n\nYAML is a human-readable data serialization format, and it's commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.\n\nA simple YAML example might look like this:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: pdf_analytics\nparams:\n  action: count\n  target_word: sustainability\n```\n\nBut I need to match the exact parameter names as given in the function definitions.\n\nLooking back, for pdf_analytics, the parameters are:\n\n- action\n\n- target_word\n\nAnd for text_analysis:\n\n- action\n\n- target_word\n\nSo, the parameter names are the same in both functions.\n\nTherefore, the YAML should specify the function name and then the parameters with their values.\n\nGiven that, the YAML for pdf_analytics would be:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: pdf_analytics\nparams:\n  action: count\n  target_word: sustainability\n```\n\nAnd for text_analysis:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: text_analysis\nparams:\n  action: count_words\n  target_word: sustainability\n```\n\nBut since I've decided that pdf_analytics is more appropriate for this task, I'll go with the first one.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any advantage to using text_analysis. Maybe text_analysis has more general text processing capabilities, but since the input is a PDF, pdf_analytics might be better equipped to handle it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps text_analysis requires the text to be pre-extracted from the PDF, whereas pdf_analytics can directly work with the PDF file.\n\nBut since the user provided a PDF document, it's likely that pdf_analytics can handle it directly.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with pdf_analytics.\n\nSo, the final answer in YAML format is:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: pdf_analytics\nparams:\n  action: count\n  target_word: sustainability\n```\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\text{function: pdf\\_analytics} \\\\ \\text{params:} \\\\ \\quad \\text{action: count} \\\\ \\quad \\text{target\\_word: sustainability} } \\]"
