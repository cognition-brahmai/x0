        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming subcommittees from a group of 3 men and 5 women, and each subcommittee must have at least one man and one woman. I need to figure out how many different subcommittees can be formed under these conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a total of 3 men and 5 women, making 8 people in total. We're to form subcommittees from these 8 people, but with the condition that each subcommittee must include at least one man and one woman. The problem doesn't specify the size of the subcommittees, so I think we have to consider all possible sizes, as long as they include at least one man and one woman.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k members from a set of n is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). But in this case, since the subcommittee can be of any size, I need to sum over all possible k, but with the constraints that there's at least one man and one woman in the subcommittee.\n\nOne approach could be to calculate the total number of possible subcommittees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of subcommittees that consist of only men or only women. That way, the remaining subcommittees would necessarily include at least one man and one woman.\n\nSo, first, let's calculate the total number of possible subcommittees from 8 people. Since each person can either be in the subcommittee or not, there are 2^8 = 256 possible subsets, including the empty set. But since a subcommittee can't be empty, we subtract 1, giving us 255 possible non-empty subcommittees.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the subcommittees that are all men or all women.\n\nThe number of all-men subcommittees is the number of subsets of the 3 men, which is 2^3 = 8, including the empty set. Again, since subcommittees can't be empty, we subtract 1, giving us 7 all-men subcommittees.\n\nSimilarly, the number of all-women subcommittees is the number of subsets of the 5 women, which is 2^5 = 32, minus 1 for the empty set, giving us 31 all-women subcommittees.\n\nTherefore, the number of subcommittees with at least one man and one woman should be the total non-empty subcommittees minus the all-men and all-women subcommittees:\n\n255 - 7 - 31 = 217.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nTotal non-empty subcommittees: 2^8 - 1 = 255.\n\nAll-men subcommittees: 2^3 - 1 = 7.\n\nAll-women subcommittees: 2^5 - 1 = 31.\n\nSo, 255 - 7 - 31 = 217.\n\nHmm, that seems right, but maybe I should consider another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider all possible pairs of at least one man and at least one woman, and then see how many subcommittees include such pairs.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Alternatively, I can think in terms of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal subcommittees: 2^8 - 1 = 255.\n\nSubcommittees with only men: 2^3 - 1 = 7.\n\nSubcommittees with only women: 2^5 - 1 = 31.\n\nSo, subcommittees with at least one man and one woman: 255 - 7 - 31 = 217.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the total subcommittees minus the all-men and all-women subcommittees, which is what I did.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can calculate it another way.\n\nLet's think about choosing at least one man and at least one woman.\n\nThe number of ways to choose at least one man is total subsets minus the subsets with no men, which is 2^8 - 2^5 = 256 - 32 = 224.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose at least one woman is 2^8 - 2^3 = 256 - 8 = 248.\n\nBut if I add these two, I'm double-counting the subcommittees that have both at least one man and at least one woman.\n\nWait, that might not be directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of subcommittees with at least one man and at least one woman directly.\n\nMaybe it's better to fix the number of men and women in the subcommittee and sum over all possible combinations that satisfy the conditions.\n\nSo, let's let the subcommittee have m men and w women, where m >= 1 and w >= 1, and m + w >= 1.\n\nBut m can be from 1 to 3, and w can be from 1 to 5, as long as m + w >= 1, which is already satisfied since m and w are at least 1.\n\nSo, the total number of such subcommittees is the sum over m from 1 to 3 and w from 1 to 5 of C(3, m) * C(5, w).\n\nLet's compute that.\n\nFirst, for m = 1:\n\nSum over w from 1 to 5: C(3,1) * C(5,w) = 3 * (C(5,1) + C(5,2) + C(5,3) + C(5,4) + C(5,5))\n\nC(5,1) = 5\n\nC(5,2) = 10\n\nC(5,3) = 10\n\nC(5,4) = 5\n\nC(5,5) = 1\n\nSo, sum for m=1: 3 * (5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1) = 3 * 31 = 93\n\nNext, for m = 2:\n\nC(3,2) = 3\n\nSum over w from 1 to 5: 3 * (5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1) = 3 * 31 = 93\n\nWait, that's the same as for m=1.\n\nWait, no, actually, C(3,2) is 3, same as C(3,1), so it's the same calculation.\n\nThen, for m=3:\n\nC(3,3) = 1\n\nSum over w from 1 to 5: 1 * (5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1) = 1 * 31 = 31\n\nSo, total subcommittees with at least one man and one woman: 93 + 93 + 31 = 217\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 217.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nTotal subcommittees: 255\n\nAll-men: 7\n\nAll-women: 31\n\nSo, 255 - 7 - 31 = 217.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to calculate the number of subcommittees that include at least one man and at least one woman directly.\n\nThis can be done using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe number of subcommittees that include at least one man is total subcommittees minus subcommittees with no men, which is 255 - 31 = 224.\n\nThe number of subcommittees that include at least one woman is 255 - 7 = 248.\n\nBut if we add these two, we get 224 + 248 = 472, which counts the subcommittees with both at least one man and one woman twice.\n\nSo, to find the number of subcommittees with at least one man and one woman, we need to subtract the total subcommittees from this sum, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying inclusion-exclusion here.\n\nLet me recall: to find the number of subcommittees that have at least one man and at least one woman, it's equivalent to total subcommittees minus those that have no men or no women.\n\nThat is, |A \u2229 B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u222a B|, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, the inclusion-exclusion principle for two sets is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nBut in this context, perhaps it's better to think in terms of complement.\n\nThe number of subcommittees with at least one man and at least one woman is equal to the total subcommittees minus the subcommittees with only men minus the subcommittees with only women.\n\nWhich is again 255 - 7 - 31 = 217.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to choose at least one man and at least one woman, which is the product of the number of ways to choose at least one man and the number of ways to choose at least one woman, minus the subcommittees that include at least one man or at least one woman, but that seems more complicated.\n\nNo, actually, that's not correct. Better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nSo, the final answer is 217.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{217} \\]"
