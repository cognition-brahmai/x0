        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a simple chat server in Java using sockets that can handle multiple clients. This server will allow clients to connect, send messages to each other, and disconnect properly. To achieve this, we'll use Java's built-in socket programming capabilities along with some threading to manage multiple clients simultaneously.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - The server will listen for incoming client connections on a specified port.\n   - For each client that connects, the server will create a new thread to handle that client's communications.\n\n2. **Client Handling:**\n   - Each client thread will read messages from its associated client and broadcast those messages to all other connected clients.\n   - The thread will also handle the disconnection of the client gracefully.\n\n3. **Messaging:**\n   - Messages will be sent as strings.\n   - The server will prepend the client's username to each message to identify the sender.\n\n4. **User Management:**\n   - Each client will be assigned a unique username upon connection.\n   - The server will keep track of all connected users and their associated threads.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ChatServer {\n    private static final int PORT = 12345;\n    private static HashSet<String> userNames = new HashSet<>();\n    private static HashSet<PrintWriter> writers = new HashSet<>();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Chat Server is running...\");\n        try (ServerSocket listener = new ServerSocket(PORT)) {\n            while (true) {\n                new ClientThread(listener.accept()).start();\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error in server: \" + e.getMessage());\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static class ClientThread extends Thread {\n        private String username;\n        private Socket socket;\n        private BufferedReader in;\n        private PrintWriter out;\n\n        public ClientThread(Socket socket) {\n            this.socket = socket;\n        }\n\n        public void run() {\n            try {\n                in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n                out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n                // Get a unique username for this client\n                while (true) {\n                    out.println(\"Enter your username:\");\n                    username = in.readLine();\n                    if (username == null || username.isEmpty()) {\n                        out.println(\"Username cannot be empty. Please try again.\");\n                        continue;\n                    }\n                    if (userNames.contains(username)) {\n                        out.println(\"Username already in use. Please choose another.\");\n                    } else {\n                        userNames.add(username);\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                out.println(\"Welcome, \" + username + \"! Type '/quit' to exit.\");\n                writers.add(out);\n\n                // Broadcast the arrival of the new user\n                broadcast(username + \" has joined the chat.\", username);\n\n                String message;\n                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                    if (\"/quit\".equals(message)) {\n                        break;\n                    }\n                    broadcast(username + \": \" + message, username);\n                }\n\n                // User is disconnecting\n                userNames.remove(username);\n                writers.remove(out);\n                socket.close();\n                broadcast(username + \" has left the chat.\", username);\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                if (username != null) {\n                    userNames.remove(username);\n                    writers.remove(out);\n                    broadcast(username + \" has left the chat.\", username);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        private void broadcast(String message, String sender) {\n            for (PrintWriter writer : writers) {\n                if (!writer.equals(out)) { // Don't send back to the sender\n                    writer.println(message);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Server Setup:**\n   - The server listens on port `12345` for incoming client connections.\n   - For each connection, a new `ClientThread` is created and started.\n\n2. **Client Handling:**\n   - Each `ClientThread` handles a single client's communication.\n   - It assigns a unique username to the client and manages their input and output streams.\n   - The thread reads messages from the client and broadcasts them to all other connected clients.\n\n3. **Messaging:**\n   - Messages are sent as strings, and the server prepends the sender's username to each message.\n   - The special command `/quit` is used to disconnect a client gracefully.\n\n4. **User Management:**\n   - Usernames are stored in a set to ensure uniqueness.\n   - Output streams (`PrintWriter`) are managed in a set to broadcast messages efficiently.\n\nThis setup ensures that multiple clients can connect and communicate with each other through the server, with each client running in its own thread for concurrency."
