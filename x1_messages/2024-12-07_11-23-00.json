        "content": "So John has a bag with 6 red balls and 4 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. He picks one ball, notes its color, puts it back, and repeats this process two more times, for a total of three picks. We want to find the probability that exactly two of those picks are red balls.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. Since John puts the ball back each time, each pick is independent of the others. That means the probability of picking a red ball doesn't change from pick to pick. The probability of picking a red ball on any single pick is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 6/10 or 0.6. Similarly, the probability of picking a blue ball is 4/10 or 0.4.\n\nNow, since the picks are independent, the probability of a specific sequence of picks can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each individual pick. For example, the probability of picking red first, then red again, then blue would be 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.4.\n\nBut we're interested in exactly two red balls in three picks. That means there are different sequences where this can happen:\n\n1. Red, Red, Blue\n\n2. Red, Blue, Red\n\n3. Blue, Red, Red\n\nEach of these sequences has exactly two red picks and one blue pick.\n\nSo, to find the total probability of getting exactly two red balls, I need to add up the probabilities of these three sequences.\n\nLet's calculate each one:\n\n1. Red, Red, Blue: 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.144\n\n2. Red, Blue, Red: 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.144\n\n3. Blue, Red, Red: 0.4 * 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.144\n\nNow, adding these up: 0.144 + 0.144 + 0.144 = 0.432\n\nSo, the probability of picking exactly two red balls in three picks is 0.432, or 43.2%.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without listing all the sequences? I think there is. This seems like a binomial probability problem.\n\nIn binomial probability, the probability of getting exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials (each with success probability p) is given by the formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, which is n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 3 (three picks), k = 2 (exactly two red balls), and p = 0.6 (probability of picking a red ball).\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(3, 2) * 0.6^2 * 0.4^1\n\nFirst, C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * 1!) = (6) / (2 * 1) = 3\n\nThen, 0.6^2 = 0.36\n\nAnd 0.4^1 = 0.4\n\nSo, P(X = 2) = 3 * 0.36 * 0.4 = 3 * 0.144 = 0.432\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier by adding the probabilities of the individual sequences.\n\nThis seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check the probability of all possible outcomes to ensure they add up to 1.\n\nPossible number of red balls: 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nLet's calculate each:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(3, 0) * 0.6^0 * 0.4^3 = 1 * 1 * 0.064 = 0.064\n\nP(X = 1) = C(3, 1) * 0.6^1 * 0.4^2 = 3 * 0.6 * 0.16 = 3 * 0.096 = 0.288\n\nP(X = 2) = C(3, 2) * 0.6^2 * 0.4^1 = 3 * 0.36 * 0.4 = 0.432\n\nP(X = 3) = C(3, 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^0 = 1 * 0.216 * 1 = 0.216\n\nNow, adding them up: 0.064 + 0.288 + 0.432 + 0.216 = 1.0\n\nPerfect, they add up to 1, which confirms that the probabilities are calculated correctly.\n\nSo, the probability of picking exactly two red balls in three picks is 0.432.\n\nBut maybe I should express it as a fraction for exactness.\n\nLet's see:\n\n0.432 can be written as 432/1000. Simplifying:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 54/125\n\nSo, 54/125 is the exact probability.\n\nAlternatively, leaving it as a decimal is fine too, depending on the context.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.432} \\]"
