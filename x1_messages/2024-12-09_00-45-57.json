        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is ((8 - 2 * 3) / 2)^2 - 5. Okay, first things first, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting inside the parentheses: (8 - 2 * 3). Here, multiplication comes before subtraction, so 2 * 3 is 6. So, 8 - 6 equals 2. Now, the expression is (2 / 2)^2 - 5.\n\nNext, division: 2 divided by 2 is 1. So now it's 1^2 - 5.\n\nThen, exponents: 1 squared is still 1. So, 1 - 5.\n\nFinally, subtraction: 1 minus 5 equals -4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-4} \\]"
