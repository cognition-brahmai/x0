        "content": "So I've got this problem here. It says that in a group of people, 75% have brown eyes and 25% have blue eyes. And it tells me that there are 48 people with blue eyes. I need to find out how many people are in the group altogether.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that percentages represent parts of a whole, and in this case, the whole is the total number of people in the group. So, 75% have brown eyes and 25% have blue eyes, which adds up to 100%, which makes sense because those are the only two eye colors mentioned.\n\nNow, I'm given that 25% of the group have blue eyes, and that number is 48 people. I need to find the total number of people in the group. Let's denote the total number of people as T.\n\nSo, 25% of T is equal to 48.\n\nIn mathematical terms, that's:\n\n0.25 * T = 48\n\nNow, to find T, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\nT = 48 / 0.25\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n0.25 is the same as 1/4, so dividing by 0.25 is the same as multiplying by 4.\n\nSo, T = 48 * 4 = 192\n\nTherefore, the total number of people in the group is 192.\n\nBut just to double-check, I can verify this by calculating 25% of 192 and see if it equals 48.\n\n25% of 192 is 0.25 * 192 = 48, which matches the given number.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, I can find out how many have brown eyes.\n\n75% of 192 is 0.75 * 192 = 144\n\nSo, 144 have brown eyes and 48 have blue eyes, which adds up to 192, the total number of people.\n\nEverything seems to check out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192} \\]"
