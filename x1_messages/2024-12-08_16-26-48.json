Each step should correspond to an evidence value (#E[index]), which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows users to conduct a web search using Bing. It helps in finding potential sources that might contain answers to the user's query.\nPageReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and generates plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extracts hyperlinks from plain text and returns a plain text, newline delimited list of links.\nAIQA[input]: An artificial intelligence-powered question-answering model, especially adept at answering queries based on an input text passage. The input must be a textual question referencing a #E[n] variable, such as \"What is the population of New York City, given #E1?\"\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [First action based on the input question]\n#E1 = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action, based on the result of #E1]\n#E2 = [Next function to call and input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence like \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the origin story of Batman and how has it evolved over time?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out about Batman's origin story and how it has changed over time. Since Batman is a comic book character, his origin probably started in the comics, but I know that he's also been in movies and TV shows, so his story might have been adapted or changed in those mediums.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up some basic information about Batman to get started. I can use the Bing tool for that. So, I'll search \"Batman origin story\" on Bing to find some sources that talk about it.\n\n#E1 = Bing[\"Batman origin story\"]\n\nOnce I have those search results, I need to figure out which ones are reliable and contain the information I'm looking for. Maybe there are Wikipedia pages or comic book database sites that have details about Batman's origins.\n\nNext, I might need to read through some of these sources to get a grasp on the original story. Probably, Batman was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, and he first appeared in Detective Comics in 1939. His origin likely involves his parents being murdered in front of him, which leads him to fight crime in Gotham City.\n\nBut I also need to look into how this origin story has evolved over time. Maybe in different comic book series, movies, or TV shows, there have been variations or additions to the story.\n\nSo, after reading some general information from #E1, I should look for sources that specifically talk about the evolution of Batman's origin story. Maybe there are articles that compare different versions across various media.\n\nI can use the HyperlinkExtractor tool to get relevant links from the search results in #E1 and then use PageReader to extract information from those pages.\n\n#E2 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E1]\n\nThen,\n\n#E3 = PageReader[#E2]\n\nAfter gathering this text, I can use AIQA to ask specific questions about the origin story and its evolution, referencing the context from #E3.\n\nFor example:\n\n#E4 = AIQA[\"What is the original origin story of Batman, and who created it? Given context: #E3\"]\n\nAnd then,\n\n#E5 = AIQA[\"How has Batman's origin story evolved over time in different media like comics, movies, and TV shows? Given context: #E3\"]\n\nI should also think about any special considerations. For instance, Batman has been around for a long time, and his story has been revised and rebooted several times. There might be different continuity lines in the comics, like the New 52 or DC Rebirth, each with their own take on his origin.\n\nMaybe I should look for a comprehensive source that outlines these different versions. Perhaps a book or a detailed article on Batman's history.\n\nAlternatively, I could search specifically for \"evolution of Batman's origin story\" to get more targeted results.\n\n#E6 = Bing[\"evolution of Batman's origin story\"]\n\nThen, extract links from #E6:\n\n#E7 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E6]\n\nAnd read those pages:\n\n#E8 = PageReader[#E7]\n\nFinally, use AIQA to summarize the information:\n\n#E9 = AIQA[\"Summarize the origin story of Batman and how it has evolved over different adaptations in comics, movies, and TV shows. Given context: #E8\"]\n\nI think that should give me a good overview of what I'm looking for.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Search for \"Batman origin story\" using Bing to find initial sources.\n\n   #E1 = Bing[\"Batman origin story\"]\n\n2. Extract relevant links from the search results.\n\n   #E2 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E1]\n\n3. Read the content from these links.\n\n   #E3 = PageReader[#E2]\n\n4. Ask AIQA about the original origin story and its creators, referencing #E3.\n\n   #E4 = AIQA[\"What is the original origin story of Batman, and who created it? Given context: #E3\"]\n\n5. Ask AIQA about how the origin story has evolved over time in different media, referencing #E3.\n\n   #E5 = AIQA[\"How has Batman's origin story evolved over time in different media like comics, movies, and TV shows? Given context: #E3\"]\n\n6. Conduct a more specific search for \"evolution of Batman's origin story\".\n\n   #E6 = Bing[\"evolution of Batman's origin story\"]\n\n7. Extract links from these search results.\n\n   #E7 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E6]\n\n8. Read the content from these links.\n\n   #E8 = PageReader[#E7]\n\n9. Summarize the origin story and its evolution using AIQA, referencing #E8.\n\n   #E9 = AIQA[\"Summarize the origin story of Batman and how it has evolved over different adaptations in comics, movies, and TV shows. Given context: #E8\"]\n\nFinal Answer: #E9"
