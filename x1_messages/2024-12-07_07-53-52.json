Held every four years, the Olympics bring together athletes from all over the world to compete in a wide range of sports disciplines. The modern Olympics were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. The first modern Olympic Games took place in Athens, Greece, in 1896, and since then, they have become a global celebration of athletic excellence and international unity."
