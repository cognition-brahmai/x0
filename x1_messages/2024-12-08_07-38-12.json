        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, making a total of 12 balls. We're going to draw 3 balls at random without putting any back, and we want to find the probability that out of these 3 balls, 2 are red and 1 is blue.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand that since we're drawing without replacement, the probability changes with each draw because the total number of balls decreases. But in this case, since we're dealing with combinations, we can use the concept of combinations to find the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the formula for probability is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes when drawing 3 balls out of 12. This is simply the number of combinations of 12 balls taken 3 at a time, which is denoted as \\( C(12, 3) \\) or \\( \\binom{12}{3} \\).\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ C(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3!(12 - 3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!} \\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 9! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[ C(12, 3) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9!}{3! \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{1320}{6} = 220 \\]\n\nSo, there are 220 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 12.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is getting 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 5 red balls. This is \\( C(5, 2) \\):\n\n\\[ C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2! \\times 3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 3!} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose 2 red balls from 5.\n\nNext, we need to choose 1 blue ball from 7 blue balls. This is \\( C(7, 1) \\):\n\n\\[ C(7, 1) = \\frac{7!}{1!(7 - 1)!} = \\frac{7!}{1! \\times 6!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6!}{1 \\times 6!} = 7 \\]\n\nSo, there are 7 ways to choose 1 blue ball from 7.\n\nNow, since these are independent choices (choosing red balls and choosing blue balls), we multiply the number of ways to get the total number of favorable outcomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of favorable outcomes} = C(5, 2) \\times C(7, 1) = 10 \\times 7 = 70 \\]\n\nSo, there are 70 favorable ways to draw 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{70}{220} \\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10:\n\n\\[ \\frac{70 \\div 10}{220 \\div 10} = \\frac{7}{22} \\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{7}{22} \\).\n\nAlternatively, we can convert this to a decimal to get a better sense of it:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{22} \\approx 0.3181 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 31.81%.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, \\( C(12, 3) = 220 \\) seems correct.\n\nThen, \\( C(5, 2) = 10 \\) and \\( C(7, 1) = 7 \\), and their product is 70, which also seems correct.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed \\( \\frac{70}{220} = \\frac{7}{22} \\), which is approximately 31.81%.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think about the different sequences in which we can draw 2 red balls and 1 blue ball. For example, we could draw red first, then red, then blue (RRB), or red, blue, red (RBR), or blue, red, red (BRR). Each of these sequences has a different probability, but since we're drawing without replacement, we need to calculate each sequence separately and then add them up.\n\nLet's try this approach to verify our earlier result.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing RRB:\n\n- Probability of first ball being red: \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\)\n\n- Probability of second ball being red, given the first was red: \\( \\frac{4}{11} \\)\n\n- Probability of third ball being blue, given the first two were red: \\( \\frac{7}{10} \\)\n\nSo, the probability of RRB is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{12} \\times \\frac{4}{11} \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 7}{12 \\times 11 \\times 10} = \\frac{140}{1320} = \\frac{7}{66} \\]\n\nNext, the probability of RBR:\n\n- Probability of first ball being red: \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\)\n\n- Probability of second ball being blue, given the first was red: \\( \\frac{7}{11} \\)\n\n- Probability of third ball being red, given the first was red and the second was blue: \\( \\frac{4}{10} \\)\n\nSo, the probability of RBR is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{12} \\times \\frac{7}{11} \\times \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{5 \\times 7 \\times 4}{12 \\times 11 \\times 10} = \\frac{140}{1320} = \\frac{7}{66} \\]\n\nNext, the probability of BRR:\n\n- Probability of first ball being blue: \\( \\frac{7}{12} \\)\n\n- Probability of second ball being red, given the first was blue: \\( \\frac{5}{11} \\)\n\n- Probability of third ball being red, given the first was blue and the second was red: \\( \\frac{4}{10} \\)\n\nSo, the probability of BRR is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{12} \\times \\frac{5}{11} \\times \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{7 \\times 5 \\times 4}{12 \\times 11 \\times 10} = \\frac{140}{1320} = \\frac{7}{66} \\]\n\nNow, we add up the probabilities of these three sequences:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{66} + \\frac{7}{66} + \\frac{7}{66} = \\frac{21}{66} = \\frac{7}{22} \\]\n\nSo, again, we get \\( \\frac{7}{22} \\), which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing 2 red balls and 1 blue ball is \\( \\frac{7}{22} \\).\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this problem.\n\nWe could also use the concept of permutations, since the order in which we draw the balls matters in the sequential approach, but in the combination approach, order doesn't matter.\n\nIn the combination approach, we directly calculate the number of ways to choose 2 reds out of 5 and 1 blue out of 7, and divide by the total number of ways to choose any 3 balls out of 12.\n\nIn the permutation approach, we consider the order of drawing the balls, as we did when we calculated the probabilities for RRB, RBR, and BRR separately.\n\nBoth approaches should give us the same final probability, which they do, as we've seen.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the probability remains \\( \\frac{7}{22} \\).\n\nI think that's pretty much it. Unless there's something else to consider, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{22}} \\]"
