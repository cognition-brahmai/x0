None suffer to have me, but do from my lack.\" Hmm, interesting. So, I need to figure out what this is describing.\n\nFirst, it says, \"I weaken all men for hours each day.\" Weaken all men? That sounds pretty broad. Maybe it's something that affects everyone, regardless of who they are. Could it be sleep? Sleep weakens us in a way because we're not alert or active during that time. But sleep is more of a natural state, not necessarily something that weakens us.\n\nOr maybe it's aging. Aging weakens all men over time, but it's not something that happens for hours each day. It's a gradual process. So maybe not that.\n\nNext, \"I show you strange visions while you are away.\" Visions while you're away... that sounds like dreams. When we're asleep, we're \"away\" from wakefulness, and we experience dreams, which can be strange and vivid.\n\nContinuing, \"I take you by night, by day take you back.\" Taking you by night sounds like sleep again, since that's when we typically sleep. And by day, you take us back, which could mean waking up and returning to consciousness.\n\nFinally, \"None suffer to have me, but do from my lack.\" People don't suffer from having sleep; in fact, most people need sleep to function properly. However, lacking sleep can cause suffering, both physically and mentally.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like the answer is sleep. It weakens us temporarily by making us less active and alert, shows us strange visions in the form of dreams, takes us by night when we sleep, and returns us by day when we wake up. And indeed, while having sleep is necessary and not problematic, lacking sleep can cause significant issues.\n\nSo, I think the answer to the riddle is sleep."
