        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 12 red balls, 8 blue balls, and 10 green balls. So, total, that's 12 + 8 + 10. Let's calculate that: 12 plus 8 is 20, plus 10 is 30 balls in total.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability that when I pick one ball at random, it's not a red ball. Okay, so first, I need to understand what probability means here. Probability is usually the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 30. The favorable outcomes are the ones where I pick a ball that's not red. So, that means it could be either blue or green.\n\nLet's see, there are 8 blue balls and 10 green balls. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 8 + 10, which is 18.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 18 divided by 30. But maybe I can simplify that fraction. Both 18 and 30 are divisible by 6. So, 18 divided by 6 is 3, and 30 divided by 6 is 5. So, the simplified fraction is 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of complementary probability. The probability that I don't pick a red ball is the same as 1 minus the probability that I do pick a red ball.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls, which is 12, divided by the total number of balls, which is 30. So, that's 12/30, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nThen, 1 minus 2/5 is 3/5, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both ways, I end up with 3/5 as the probability of picking a ball that's not red.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Total balls: 12 red + 8 blue + 10 green = 30 balls. Not red balls: 8 blue + 10 green = 18. So, 18/30 = 3/5. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using complementary probability: probability of not red = 1 - probability of red. Probability of red is 12/30 = 2/5. So, 1 - 2/5 = 3/5. Same answer.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Probability of not picking a red ball is 3/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
