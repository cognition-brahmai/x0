Can he do it? And what has Senator McCain got to say about it? Well, we are running the numbers and reading the tea leaves with the best political team on television. Also, she says she\\'s in it to win it for Barack Obama -- the \"Raw Politics\" behind Hillary Clinton\\'s promise to work her heart out for the man who beat her. Plus, the strange connection between Bill, Barack Obama and the blogger who taped Bill\\'s temper tantrum. We will tell you about that. And then later, breathtaking images and heartbreaking stories with the rivers rising and the earth giving ground. We\\'re going to take you to the soggy scene in the Midwest and update you on the worst flooding there in decades. We have got a very heavy night of news. And we begin with this. Today, for the second day running, the average price of gasoline topped $4 a gallon nationwide. Tonight, Americans tell CNN they expect it to go even higher. And they are already making significant changes in their own lives. The big question: With prices soaring and the job market sagging and the housing market tanking, can Barack Obama, like Bill Clinton in 1992, turn this into a referendum on the economy? Well, he sure seems to think so. Take a look now at this map. These are the dozen states that were decided by five percentage points or less in 2004. Of these 12, Barack Obama plans, over the next two weeks, to campaign in four big ones, representing 79 electoral votes, touting his plans to fix the economy. And in many of those purple states, yellow on our map, John McCain will be hot on his heels talking about your money, trying to win your vote. We get more now from CNN\\'s Jessica Yellin. JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Barack Obama\\'s economic message could not be any simpler. YELLIN: In his first policy speech of the general election, Obama attempted to bind his opponent to George Bush. He mentioned the president 15 times. OBAMA: Senator McCain wants to turn Bush\\'s policy of too little too late into a policy of even less even later. The centerpiece of John McCain\\'s economic plan amounts to a full-throated endorsement of George Bush\\'s policies. We can\\'t afford four more years of skewed priorities that give us nothing but record debt. YELLIN: McCain\\'s campaign is striking back, hitting where Democrats have hurt before. CARLY FIORINA, VICTORY CHAIR, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Barack Obama\\'s plan, basically, is to raise virtually every tax out there. Raising taxes when economies are hurting is the wrong formula. YELLIN: Or, as McCain puts it: SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will leave it to my opponent to propose returning to the failed big government mandates of the \\'60s and \\'70s. YELLIN: The latest CNN poll shows, 78 percent of Americans believe the economy is in poor shape. So, Obama is seizing on that economic anxiety, proposing short-term solutions, including another round of rebate checks, part of a $50 billion stimulus package. OBAMA: If the government can bail out investment banks on Wall Street, we can extend a hand to folks who are struggling here on Main Street. YELLIN: He promises to shut down corporate tax loopholes, and accuses McCain of supporting massive tax giveaways to an oil conglomerate. OBAMA: When we\\'re paying more than $4 a gallon for gas, the man who rails against government spending wants to spend $1.2 billion on a tax break for ExxonMobil. That isn\\'t just irresponsible. It is outrageous. YELLIN: And he\\'s vowing to enact a middle-class tax cut that would help Americans who earn up to $150,000 a year. The policy details were few. Shaping a message was Obama\\'s goal, as he seeks to define himself as McCain\\'s opposite. OBAMA: This is a choice you will face in November. You can vote for John McCain and see a continuation, see a continuation of Bush economic policies. But I don\\'t think that\\'s the future we want. YELLIN (on camera): McCain says he believes the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Well, you can expect Obama to use that against McCain as much as possible. In fact, team Obama believes, if this election is a referendum on our economy, then Obama wins. Jessica Yellin, CNN, Washington. BROWN: Digging deeper, CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, GOP strategist and CNN contributor Ed Rollins, and Dee Dee Myers, Bill Clinton\\'s former White House press secretary and the author of \"Why Women Should Rule the World.\" Good to see you all. David, let me start with you. The economy\\'s going to be a huge issue in this fall. As we just heard Jessica tell us, 78 percent of the people surveyed say that the economy is in poor shape. And look at this number. This is 86 percent of people think it\\'s likely that gas prices are going to hit $5 per gallon this year. Now, Obama argues, McCain is an extension of Bush\\'s failed economic policies. If he is able to make this about the economy, is that a winner? DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Absolutely. The economy is becoming the mother lode of this campaign. Neither Barack Obama, nor John McCain has been particularly effective in the primaries at convincing voters that they have the answers on the economy. Today, Barack Obama is trying to seize the initiative. He\\'s going to go out on this two-week tour to these key states, laying out his short-term plans today, laying out long-term plans a week from now. And if he can make this -- if he can turn the economy into his issue, if he can open up a big lead against John McCain at who would be more effective at addressing the economy in the future, yes, I think that -- I think he could crack open a big lead in the race and win the election. We haven\\'t yet heard John McCain really coming out fulsomely against it yet, and joining the debate. But Barack Obama got off to what I think was a strong start today in North Carolina. BROWN: Ed, in an attempt to distance himself from Bush\\'s policy, one of McCain\\'s top advisers recently said this, that Bush knows very little about the economy, beyond holding down tax rates. Does McCain have to make a clear break from Bush on this issue to have credibility with voters? ED ROLLINS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, sure -- sure he does. I mean, obviously, you can\\'t say repeatedly say -- he said it himself -- and now to have his advisers say, I don\\'t know very much about the economy, when it\\'s the number-one issue in the country. BROWN: Yes. ROLLINS: And I think the critical thing is that he -- he, in turn -- I mean, leadership is going to be very important. And the person who can get out front and say, I have a real plan. And economists around the country say, it\\'s a plan that might work. It may be different than what\\'s there today. But to argue that all I\\'m going to do is support the Bush tax cuts for the future, they\\'re not going to stay in existence anyways. So, I think you have got to offer some alternatives. You have got to offer some hope. BROWN: Dee Dee, let me ask you about Obama. We mentioned that his tour started today in North Carolina. He\\'s offering short-term solutions to ease general economic anxiety that Americans are having now. But do you think that\\'s going to be enough, or does he really need to lay out a more detailed long- term policy to try to convince voters that he can do this? DEE DEE MYERS, FORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I think he needs to do both. He needs to talk about some short-term solutions to people who are really feeling the pinch. And as he travels around the country, I\\'m sure he comes in contact every day with people who are really suffering because of high gas prices, job insecurity, the mortgage crisis. But, at the same time, he needs a long-term plan. But the third piece of this for him is that he really has to connect with voters, that he has to make sure that he not only has a 10-point plan, but that he goes around and connects with the Democrats that he didn\\'t necessarily connect with in the primaries. And a lot of working-class Democrats voted for Hillary Clinton on economic issues across the last three months. In fact, she won the last three months of this campaign largely on economic issues. So, he needs to go back, dig in, connect his big ideas with the details that will make people\\'s lives better. And I think he has the opportunity and the potential to do that. But now he has to go out and do it. BROWN: So, how does he do that, David? GERGEN: Well, I want to say this. He promised today in his speech that, a week from today, he would give his long-term plan, that he would lay it out in another speech then, to go to Dee Dee\\'s point. But I also think Dee Dee is right about it\\'s -- the problem with his speech today was that it had too many different pieces. There was no central theme. And he needs to simplify this. In the hands of a Clinton, this speech could have been really more powerful today. I think he needs to -- it almost sounded as if he didn\\'t write this speech or didn\\'t have much to do with it. He is a better speaker than this speech was. Where I think he got the initiative was going out front and being first on it and making this economic tour. But I think he has to sharpen his rhetoric, sharpen the arguments. And, on that, I think this has got to be somehow communicated in a way that people can listen to. It\\'s a little too Washingtonian right now. It\\'s got to have a little more Reagan, frankly, and a little more pop to it. The one line that really worked for him was the one about ExxonMobil. They just had these record profits. And now he\\'s accusing McCain of supporting a tax break for ExxonMobil. That\\'s a pretty good argument. BROWN: Now, assuming, Ed, he\\'s able to simplify, to boil all this language down, to get it into a, David, if you will, a \"It\\'s the economy, stupid\" kind message that connects with people, that is centrally what this campaign becomes about, isn\\'t it? BROWN: How does McCain respond to that? ROLLINS: This campaign has to be about the future. You have to give some hope that, in a year from now, gasoline won\\'t be $6 a gallon. You have to give some hope that the mortgage situation -- that there won\\'t be another million people losing their homes among the two million. You have got to give some hope that, basically, it\\'s not just about, I\\'m going to cut tax rates for the middle class and Bush, and Reagan, and McCain have all cut them for the rich people. You have got to basically convince blue-collar voters that you\\'re going to help restimulate this economy, create jobs, and make their lives better and more effective. BROWN: All right, guys, David Gergen, Ed Rollins, Dee Dee Myers, we are coming back to you in just a minute. But we want to move forward, because, as always, we are live- blogging. Well, actually, Erica Hill is live-blogging. I\\'m still warming up. But join in the conversation, if you want to, at CNN.com/360. We\\'re going to have a lot more politics tonight, including the lowdown on Hillary Clinton\\'s promise to work for Barack Obama. And Bill Clinton back to his old ways, but it\\'s not what you\\'re thinking. We\\'re going to explain. And then later; rivers rising, lakes overflowing, water everywhere. And the worse may be yet to come. We\\'re going to have the latest on the flooding tonight on 360.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
