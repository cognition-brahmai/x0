This sword is often considered to be one of the most iconic symbols associated with King Arthur and his reign. The story of Excalibur varies slightly depending on the source, but generally, it is said that after Arthur proves his worthiness, the Lady of the Lake presents him with the sword, which is said to possess mystical powers and is unbreakable. In some versions, Excalibur is also associated with the Stone of Destiny and the concept of rightful kingship."
