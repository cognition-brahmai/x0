        "content": "Let's see. The store sells shirts for $25 each and pants for $40 each. The customer buys 3 shirts and 2 pairs of pants and pays with a $200 bill. I need to find out how much change they will receive.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total cost of the shirts. Since each shirt is $25 and the customer buys 3 shirts, I'll multiply 25 by 3.\n\n25 \u00d7 3 = 75\n\nSo, the shirts cost $75 in total.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total cost of the pants. Each pair of pants is $40, and the customer buys 2 pairs, so I'll multiply 40 by 2.\n\n40 \u00d7 2 = 80\n\nTherefore, the pants cost $80 in total.\n\nNow, I need to find the total cost of both the shirts and the pants. I'll add the cost of the shirts and the cost of the pants together.\n\n75 + 80 = 155\n\nSo, the total cost is $155.\n\nThe customer pays with a $200 bill, so to find out the change, I'll subtract the total cost from $200.\n\n200 - 155 = 45\n\nTherefore, the customer will receive $45 in change.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, shirts: 3 \u00d7 25 = 75. That seems correct.\n\nPants: 2 \u00d7 40 = 80. That's also correct.\n\nTotal cost: 75 + 80 = 155. That's right.\n\nChange from $200: 200 - 155 = 45. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the customer will receive $45 in change.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
