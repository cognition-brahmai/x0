        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. It says the diameter is 10 feet and the height is 15 feet, and I need to find its volume in cubic feet. Okay, I remember that the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nFirst, I need to find the radius. The diameter is 10 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is 5 feet. Got it.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula: V = \u03c0*(5)^2*15.\n\nLet me calculate 5 squared: 5^2 = 25.\n\nThen, multiply that by the height: 25*15 = 375.\n\nSo, the volume is 375\u03c0 cubic feet.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it in terms of \u03c0, or maybe compute a numerical value. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll leave it as 375\u03c0 cubic feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to check this? Maybe I can think about the area of the base and then multiply by the height.\n\nThe base is a circle with radius 5 feet, so the area is \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*25 = 25\u03c0 square feet.\n\nThen, multiplying by the height: 25\u03c0 * 15 = 375\u03c0 cubic feet. Yeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I need a numerical value, I can approximate \u03c0 as 3.14.\n\nSo, 375 * 3.14 = let's see:\n\n300*3.14 = 942\n\n75*3.14 = 235.5\n\nTotal = 942 + 235.5 = 1177.5 cubic feet.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify to use a decimal approximation, I think leaving it as 375\u03c0 cubic feet is fine.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the units. Diameter is in feet, height is in feet, so volume should be in cubic feet, which it is.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't miss anything in the calculation. Let's see: radius is half the diameter, which is 5 feet, squared is 25, times height 15 is 375, times \u03c0 is 375\u03c0. Seems solid.\n\nI think that's the answer: 375\u03c0 cubic feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375\\pi} \\]"
