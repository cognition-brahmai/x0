        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria doubling every hour. Let's see, initially, there are 10 bacteria, and I need to find out how many there will be after 12 hours. Hmm, doubling every hour sounds like exponential growth, right?\n\nSo, exponential growth means that the amount increases by the same factor over equal intervals of time. In this case, the interval is one hour, and the factor is 2, since the bacteria double.\n\nI remember that the general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ N = N_0 \\times k^t \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the final amount,\n\n- \\( N_0 \\) is the initial amount,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the growth factor,\n\n- \\( t \\) is time in the same units as the growth rate.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( N_0 = 10 \\) bacteria,\n\n- \\( k = 2 \\) (since it doubles),\n\n- \\( t = 12 \\) hours.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ N = 10 \\times 2^{12} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 2^{12} \\). Let's see:\n\n\\[ 2^1 = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^5 = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^6 = 64 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^8 = 256 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^9 = 512 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{10} = 1024 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{11} = 2048 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{12} = 4096 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\).\n\nNow, multiply that by the initial amount:\n\n\\[ N = 10 \\times 4096 = 40960 \\]\n\nTherefore, after 12 hours, there will be 40,960 bacteria.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 10 bacteria:\n\nAfter 1 hour: \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\)\n\nAfter 2 hours: \\( 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\)\n\nAfter 3 hours: \\( 40 \\times 2 = 80 \\)\n\nAfter 4 hours: \\( 80 \\times 2 = 160 \\)\n\nAfter 5 hours: \\( 160 \\times 2 = 320 \\)\n\nAfter 6 hours: \\( 320 \\times 2 = 640 \\)\n\nAfter 7 hours: \\( 640 \\times 2 = 1280 \\)\n\nAfter 8 hours: \\( 1280 \\times 2 = 2560 \\)\n\nAfter 9 hours: \\( 2560 \\times 2 = 5120 \\)\n\nAfter 10 hours: \\( 5120 \\times 2 = 10240 \\)\n\nAfter 11 hours: \\( 10240 \\times 2 = 20480 \\)\n\nAfter 12 hours: \\( 20480 \\times 2 = 40960 \\)\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 40,960 bacteria after 12 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of exponents. Since the bacteria double every hour, the amount after \\( t \\) hours is the initial amount multiplied by 2 raised to the power of \\( t \\). That's what I did earlier.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that each bacterium divides into two every hour, so the population doubles each hour.\n\nI should also consider if there are any limitations to this growth. For example, maybe the bacteria have limited resources and can't keep doubling indefinitely. But the problem doesn't mention any constraints, so I'll assume unlimited growth for this scenario.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The time interval for doubling is hourly, and the time given is in hours, so that's fine.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using logarithms or some other properties of exponents, but I think the straightforward approach is the best here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what the population would be after a few more hours to see the pattern.\n\nAfter 13 hours: \\( 40960 \\times 2 = 81920 \\)\n\nAfter 14 hours: \\( 81920 \\times 2 = 163840 \\)\n\nAnd so on. Yes, it's clearly exponential growth.\n\nI can also verify \\( 2^{12} \\) using the fact that \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\), which is a common memory size in computing. So, \\( 2^{12} = 2^{10} \\times 2^2 = 1024 \\times 4 = 4096 \\), which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is indeed 40,960 bacteria after 12 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40960} \\]"
