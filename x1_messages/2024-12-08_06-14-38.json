        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 widgets per day, and each widget needs 2 screws and 3 bolts. We have 2000 screws and 3000 bolts in inventory. I need to find out how many days the factory can keep making widgets before it runs out of either screws or bolts.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many screws and bolts are used each day.\n\nSince each widget requires 2 screws, and they make 500 widgets per day, the daily screw usage is:\n\n2 screws/widget * 500 widgets/day = 1000 screws/day\n\nSimilarly, each widget requires 3 bolts, so the daily bolt usage is:\n\n3 bolts/widget * 500 widgets/day = 1500 bolts/day\n\nNow, with 2000 screws in inventory, how many days can they last?\n\n2000 screws / 1000 screws/day = 2 days\n\nAnd with 3000 bolts:\n\n3000 bolts / 1500 bolts/day = 2 days\n\nSo, both screws and bolts will last for 2 days.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe the factory will run out of one component before the other.\n\nLet me calculate the total screws needed for x days:\n\n1000 screws/day * x days = 1000x screws\n\nSimilarly, bolts needed for x days:\n\n1500 bolts/day * x days = 1500x bolts\n\nGiven that we have 2000 screws and 3000 bolts, we need to ensure that:\n\n1000x \u2264 2000 and 1500x \u2264 3000\n\nSolving for x in both inequalities:\n\nx \u2264 2000 / 1000 = 2\n\nx \u2264 3000 / 1500 = 2\n\nSo, x \u2264 2 days\n\nBoth constraints give us the same limit, so the factory can operate for 2 days before running out of either screws or bolts.\n\nBut what if the usage rates were different, or the inventory amounts were different? It's important to check both components to see which one limits the production first.\n\nIn this case, both screws and bolts limit the production to 2 days, so the factory can continue for 2 days before needing to restock.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
