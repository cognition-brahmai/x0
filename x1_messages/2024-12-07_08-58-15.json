        "content": "So there are 25 red balls and 15 blue balls in a box, making a total of 40 balls. You're picking one ball, looking at its color, putting it back, and then picking another ball. You want to know the probability that both balls you pick are red.\n\nFirst, let's understand what probability is. Probability is like figuring out the chances of something happening. It's always a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means it will never happen, and 1 means it will always happen.\n\nNow, since you're replacing the ball after the first pick, that means the total number of balls remains the same for both picks. So, each pick is independent of the other.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first try is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, that's 25 red balls out of 40 total balls. So, the probability is 25/40.\n\nSimilarly, since you're replacing the ball, the probability of picking a red ball on the second try is also 25/40.\n\nNow, because these two events are independent, meaning the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick, the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two red balls in a row, with replacement, is (25/40) multiplied by (25/40).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 25 divided by 40 is 0.625.\n\nSo, 0.625 multiplied by 0.625 is 0.390625.\n\nTo express this as a fraction, we can keep it as (25/40) * (25/40) = 625/1600.\n\nWe can simplify 625/1600 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 25, which gives us 25/64.\n\nSo, the probability is 25/64, or approximately 0.3906, which is about 39.06%.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{64}} \\]"
