        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing football and basketball. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere are 30 students in total. Out of these, 18 play football, 17 play basketball, and 10 play both games. I need to find out how many students don't play either game.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I'm pretty sure there's a formula for this.\n\nLet me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion. For two sets, the formula is:\n\nNumber of students playing football or basketball = Number playing football + Number playing basketball - Number playing both.\n\nSo, that would be 18 + 17 - 10 = 25 students play either football or basketball or both.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't play either game, I'll subtract the number who play at least one game from the total number of students.\n\nSo, 30 - 25 = 5 students don't play either game.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nn(F) = number of students playing football = 18\n\nn(B) = number of students playing basketball = 17\n\nn(F \u2229 B) = number of students playing both = 10\n\nWe need to find the number of students who don't play either, which is the complement of the union of F and B.\n\nSo, number of students not playing either = total students - n(F \u222a B)\n\nAnd n(F \u222a B) = n(F) + n(B) - n(F \u2229 B) = 18 + 17 - 10 = 25\n\nTherefore, 30 - 25 = 5\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can verify this by considering only the students who play only one sport.\n\nNumber of students playing only football = 18 - 10 = 8\n\nNumber of students playing only basketball = 17 - 10 = 7\n\nNumber of students playing both = 10\n\nSo, total playing at least one sport = 8 + 7 + 10 = 25\n\nAgain, 30 - 25 = 5 students don't play either sport.\n\nI think this makes sense. I've approached it from two different angles and got the same answer both times.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try to visualize this with a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents football players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\nThe overlap, which is n(F \u2229 B), is 10 students.\n\nSo, the part of the football circle that doesn't overlap is 18 - 10 = 8\n\nSimilarly, the part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap is 17 - 10 = 7\n\nThen, the total number of students in the union of the two circles is 8 + 7 + 10 = 25\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total number of students gives 30 - 25 = 5\n\nI feel confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
