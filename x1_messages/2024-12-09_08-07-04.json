        "content": "So you've got a rectangular garden that measures 15 meters in length and 8 meters in width, and you're wondering how much grass you need to cover it entirely. To figure this out, you're essentially looking for the area of the garden because the area will tell you how many square meters you have to cover.\n\nNow, the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\n\nGiven that your garden is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, you can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 15 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 8 \\, \\text{meters} = 120 \\, \\text{square meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, you would need 120 square meters of grass to cover the garden completely.\n\nBut let's think a bit deeper here. Maybe there are other factors to consider. For example, does the garden have any paths or features that don't need to be covered with grass? If there are areas like ponds, patios, or flower beds, you might need to subtract those areas from the total garden area to find out how much grass you actually need.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we'll assume that the entire garden needs to be covered with grass.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the overlap or wastage. When laying grass, especially if you're using turf that comes in rolls, there might be some wastage due to cutting and fitting around edges. So, it's often a good idea to buy a bit extra to account for this.\n\nLet's say you decide to buy 10% extra to cover any wastage. To calculate this:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Extra grass} = 120 \\, \\text{sq m} \\times 0.10 = 12 \\, \\text{sq m}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total grass needed} = 120 \\, \\text{sq m} + 12 \\, \\text{sq m} = 132 \\, \\text{sq m}\n\\]\n\nSo, in this case, you might want to purchase 132 square meters of grass to be safe.\n\nBut since your question specifically asks for how many square meters of grass are needed to cover the garden completely, without considering extras, the initial calculation of 120 square meters is the direct answer.\n\nIt's also worth noting that grass can be sold in rolls of specific sizes, so you might need to buy a certain number of rolls that cover the total area required. For instance, if the grass rolls are 2 meters wide and 5 meters long (which would be 10 square meters per roll), you would need:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rolls} = \\frac{120 \\, \\text{sq m}}{10 \\, \\text{sq m per roll}} = 12 \\, \\text{rolls}\n\\]\n\nAdding the 10% extra:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total rolls needed} = \\frac{132 \\, \\text{sq m}}{10 \\, \\text{sq m per roll}} = 13.2 \\, \\text{rolls}\n\\]\n\nSince you can't buy a fraction of a roll, you'd need to round up to 14 rolls.\n\nBut again, this is getting into more practical considerations beyond just the area calculation.\n\nIn summary, for a rectangular garden that is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, you need 120 square meters of grass to cover it completely. If you want to account for wastage, consider buying slightly more.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
