        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a Python script that acts as a simple calculator. It should be able to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and it should take inputs from the command line. Also, I need to make sure that the script validates the input and handles any errors that might come up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to handle command-line arguments in Python. I think the `sys` module has something to do with this. Yes, `sys.argv` can be used to access command-line arguments. So, I'll import `sys` at the beginning of my script.\n\nNow, the script should accept three arguments: two numbers and an operation. For example, if someone wants to add 5 and 3, they would run something like `python calculator.py 5 + 3`. Wait, but in programming, it's more common to have the operation in the middle like that. Maybe I should consider that order.\n\nBut actually, to make it more standard, perhaps I should use options or flags for better clarity. Maybe using the `argparse` module would be better. `argparse` allows me to define arguments more clearly and handle errors more gracefully.\n\nLet me think about this. If I use `argparse`, I can specify that there are two number arguments and one operation argument. I can also specify that the operation must be one of the four: +, -, *, /.\n\nSo, I'll import `argparse` and set up the argument parser.\n\nI'll need to define that there are two positional arguments for the numbers and one for the operation. I should also specify that the numbers should be of type float, since people might want to do calculations with decimals.\n\nWait, but what if someone enters a non-numeric value for the numbers? I need to handle that. `argparse` can handle type conversions and will throw an error if the conversion fails, which is good.\n\nFor the operation, I can define choices: +, -, *, /. That way, if someone enters something else, `argparse` will complain.\n\nOnce I have the inputs, I need to perform the specified operation on the two numbers.\n\nI need to be careful with division, as division by zero is not allowed. So, I have to check if the second number is zero when the operation is division.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the user provides exactly three arguments: two numbers and one operation. If not, I should display an error message.\n\nWait, with `argparse`, if the user provides the wrong number of arguments, it will automatically show an error and display usage instructions.\n\nThat's convenient.\n\nSo, here's a rough plan:\n\n1. Import `argparse` and `sys`.\n\n2. Set up an ArgumentParser.\n\n3. Add two arguments for the numbers, specifying that they are floats.\n\n4. Add one argument for the operation, with choices limited to +, -, *, /.\n\n5. In the script, parse the arguments.\n\n6. Based on the operation, perform the corresponding calculation.\n\n7. Print the result.\n\n8. Handle specific errors, like division by zero.\n\nLet me start writing some pseudocode.\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules:\n\nimport argparse\n\nThen, set up the argument parser:\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"A simple calculator.\")\n\nNext, add the arguments:\n\nparser.add_argument(\"num1\", type=float, help=\"First number\")\n\nparser.add_argument(\"op\", choices=['+', '-', '*', '/'], help=\"Operation\")\n\nparser.add_argument(\"num2\", type=float, help=\"Second number\")\n\nThen, parse the arguments:\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nNow, based on the operation, perform the calculation:\n\nif args.op == '+':\n\nresult = args.num1 + args.num2\n\nelif args.op == '-':\n\nresult = args.num1 - args.num2\n\nelif args.op == '*':\n\nresult = args.num1 * args.num2\n\nelif args.op == '/':\n\nif args.num2 == 0:\n\nprint(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nelse:\n\nresult = args.num1 / args.num2\n\nFinally, print the result:\n\nprint(\"Result:\", result)\n\nThat seems straightforward. But I should consider if there are any other edge cases or errors that I need to handle.\n\nFor example, what if the operation is division and the second number is zero? I've already handled that by checking if args.num2 == 0 and printing an error message, then exiting with status 1.\n\nWhat if the user provides more or fewer arguments? `argparse` should handle that and show an error message automatically.\n\nAlso, if the user provides a non-numeric value for the numbers, `argparse` should raise an error because of the type=float specification.\n\nI think that covers most of the possible errors.\n\nLet me think about the order of the arguments. In the plan above, the operation is between the two numbers, like `num1 op num2`. That seems natural for a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using options like --num1, --op, --num2, but that might be less intuitive for a simple calculator.\n\nI'll stick with positional arguments for simplicity.\n\nIs there a way to make the script more user-friendly? Maybe by displaying a help message if the user runs the script without any arguments.\n\n`argparse` automatically provides a help option if you specify the --help flag, but I can also make sure that if no arguments are provided, it displays usage instructions.\n\nWait, actually, if the user doesn't provide the required arguments, `argparse` will display an error and the usage message.\n\nThat should be sufficient.\n\nLet me consider writing a main function to encapsulate the script logic.\n\nIt's a good practice to have a main function and protect it with the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` clause.\n\nThis way, if someone imports this script as a module, the calculator won't run automatically.\n\nSo, I'll define a main function that sets up the parser and performs the calculation.\n\nAlso, I should think about how to handle invalid operations. Although I've limited the choices with `choices=['+', '-', '*', '/']`, if somehow an invalid operation slips through, I should handle it.\n\nMaybe I can add a default case in the operation checking and raise an error.\n\nBut with choices specified, `argparse` should prevent invalid operations from being passed.\n\nStill, it's good to be safe.\n\nLet me also consider formatting the output. For example, if the result is a float, I might want to format it to a certain number of decimal places.\n\nThat could be an optional feature.\n\nFor now, I'll just print the result as is.\n\nLet me summarize the steps again:\n\n1. Import `argparse` and `sys`.\n\n2. Define a main function.\n\n3. Inside main, create an ArgumentParser object.\n\n4. Add positional arguments for num1, op, and num2 with appropriate types and choices.\n\n5. Parse the arguments.\n\n6. Based on the operation, perform the calculation and handle division by zero.\n\n7. Print the result.\n\n8. If any errors occur, handle them appropriately and exit with an error code.\n\n9. Protect the main function with `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`.\n\nI think that covers everything.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the actual code based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in Python that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can use the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments and ensure proper input validation. Below is a complete Python script that accomplishes this task.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Use `argparse` to parse command-line arguments for two numbers and an operation.\n2. **Operation Support**: Support addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).\n3. **Error Handling**: Handle division by zero and invalid inputs using `argparse`'s built-in error handling.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport argparse\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"A simple calculator.\")\n    parser.add_argument(\"num1\", type=float, help=\"First number\")\n    parser.add_argument(\"op\", choices=['+', '-', '*', '/'], help=\"Operation\")\n    parser.add_argument(\"num2\", type=float, help=\"Second number\")\n    \n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    \n    if args.op == '+':\n        result = args.num1 + args.num2\n    elif args.op == '-':\n        result = args.num1 - args.num2\n    elif args.op == '*':\n        result = args.num1 * args.num2\n    elif args.op == '/':\n        if args.num2 == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n            sys.exit(1)\n        else:\n            result = args.num1 / args.num2\n    \n    print(\"Result:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Argument Parsing**: The `argparse` module is used to define and parse the command-line arguments. It ensures that the user provides two numeric arguments and a valid operation symbol.\n2. **Operations**: Based on the operation specified, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed.\n3. **Error Handling**: Division by zero is checked and an error message is printed if attempted. `argparse` handles other errors like missing arguments or invalid operation symbols.\n4. **Output**: The result of the calculation is printed to the console.\n\nThis script provides a robust and user-friendly command-line calculator with clear error handling and validation."
