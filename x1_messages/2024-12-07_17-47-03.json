        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a hospital trying to optimize its ER operations. They've got 15 doctors working in shifts, each shift is 12 hours long, and on average, each doctor sees 4 patients per hour. Now, they want to reduce patient wait times during peak hours, which are from 6 PM to 12 AM, by adding more doctors. And during these peak hours, the patient influx doubles. We need to find out how many additional doctors are needed to handle this increased patient volume.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current setup. There are 15 doctors, each working 12-hour shifts, and each sees 4 patients per hour. So, the total patient capacity per doctor per shift is:\n\n4 patients/hour * 12 hours = 48 patients per doctor per shift.\n\nTherefore, the total patient capacity for all doctors in one shift is:\n\n15 doctors * 48 patients/doctor = 720 patients per shift.\n\nNow, the peak hours are from 6 PM to 12 AM, which is a 6-hour period. During this time, the patient influx doubles. So, if normally the ER handles a certain number of patients per hour, during peak hours, it's twice that number.\n\nLet's find out the normal patient arrival rate. Since each doctor sees 4 patients per hour, and there are 15 doctors, the total patient capacity per hour is:\n\n15 doctors * 4 patients/hour = 60 patients per hour.\n\nThis suggests that normally, the ER handles 60 patients per hour. During peak hours, this doubles to:\n\n60 patients/hour * 2 = 120 patients per hour.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that during peak hours, there are enough doctors to handle 120 patients per hour.\n\nEach doctor can see 4 patients per hour, so the number of doctors needed to handle 120 patients per hour is:\n\n120 patients/hour \u00f7 4 patients/hour/doctor = 30 doctors.\n\nWait a minute, but currently, there are 15 doctors. So, during peak hours, they need 30 doctors to handle the doubled patient volume.\n\nTherefore, the additional number of doctors needed is:\n\n30 doctors - 15 doctors = 15 doctors.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check.\n\nFirst, confirm the patient arrival rate:\n\n- Normal rate: 60 patients/hour.\n\n- Peak rate: 120 patients/hour.\n\nEach doctor can see 4 patients per hour.\n\nSo, to handle 120 patients per hour, indeed:\n\n120 \u00f7 4 = 30 doctors needed.\n\nCurrently, there are 15 doctors.\n\nThus, additional doctors needed: 30 - 15 = 15.\n\nBut, is there anything else to consider? For example, are the current 15 doctors already covering the normal patient load, and we just need to add more during peak hours? Or is there a different shift structure?\n\nThe problem says that doctors are working in shifts, each 12 hours long, and they want to increase the number of doctors during peak hours (6 PM - 12 AM).\n\nAssuming that the current 15 doctors are spread out over the entire 12-hour shift, including the peak hours, but perhaps not optimized.\n\nHowever, the calculation above suggests that during peak hours, when patient volume doubles, they need twice as many doctors to handle the load, assuming the same patient per doctor rate.\n\nBut maybe the current 15 doctors are already handling the normal load, and during peak hours, the load doubles, so they need additional doctors to handle the extra load.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf normally, the ER handles 60 patients per hour with 15 doctors, and during peak hours, the patient arrival rate doubles to 120 patients per hour, then to handle the additional 60 patients per hour (120 - 60 = 60), how many additional doctors are needed?\n\nEach doctor can see 4 patients per hour, so:\n\nAdditional patients = 60 patients/hour.\n\nAdditional doctors needed = 60 \u00f7 4 = 15 doctors.\n\nSo, again, we get 15 additional doctors needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current 15 doctors can handle the normal load, and during peak hours, when the load doubles, they need to handle the extra load on top of the normal load.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, the 30 doctors are needed to handle the doubled load, which includes both the normal and the extra load.\n\nIn the second approach, since the normal load is already being handled by the 15 doctors, the additional doctors are only needed for the extra load during peak hours.\n\nBut actually, when the patient volume doubles, the total patient volume is twice the normal, so to handle that, you need twice the number of doctors, assuming each doctor's capacity remains the same.\n\nTherefore, from this perspective, doubling the number of doctors to 30 would be needed to handle the doubled patient volume.\n\nHowever, since there are already 15 doctors, the additional doctors needed would be 15.\n\nBut maybe there's a more efficient way to schedule the doctors so that during peak hours, more doctors are on duty without needing to double the number.\n\nPerhaps some doctors work only during peak hours, or perhaps they can adjust the shift lengths.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that to handle twice the patient volume during peak hours, they need twice the number of doctors.\n\nTherefore, additional doctors needed: 15.\n\nWait, but maybe I should look at it in terms of total patient volume during the peak hours and see how many doctors are needed to handle that.\n\nLet's calculate the total patient volume during peak hours.\n\nPeak hours are 6 PM to 12 AM, which is 6 hours.\n\nDuring these hours, patient arrival rate is double the normal rate.\n\nNormal rate is 60 patients per hour, so peak rate is 120 patients per hour.\n\nTherefore, total patients during peak hours:\n\n120 patients/hour * 6 hours = 720 patients.\n\nNow, each doctor can see 4 patients per hour, and during the 6-hour peak period, each doctor can see:\n\n4 patients/hour * 6 hours = 24 patients per doctor during peak hours.\n\nTherefore, the number of doctors needed to handle 720 patients during peak hours is:\n\n720 patients \u00f7 24 patients/doctor = 30 doctors.\n\nAgain, this suggests that 30 doctors are needed during peak hours to handle the patient volume.\n\nGiven that there are already 15 doctors, the additional doctors needed would be 15.\n\nBut perhaps the current 15 doctors are already working during peak hours and can handle part of the load.\n\nIf the current 15 doctors are already on duty during peak hours, and each can see 24 patients during that period, then the total patients they can handle are:\n\n15 doctors * 24 patients/doctor = 360 patients.\n\nBut during peak hours, there are 720 patients.\n\nSo, the additional patients that need to be handled are:\n\n720 - 360 = 360 patients.\n\nTherefore, the additional doctors needed to handle these 360 patients are:\n\n360 patients \u00f7 24 patients/doctor = 15 doctors.\n\nAgain, we get the same number: 15 additional doctors needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hospital can adjust the shift lengths or have doctors work only during peak hours.\n\nFor example, if some doctors work only during peak hours, that could affect the total number needed.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that to handle the doubled patient volume during peak hours, the hospital needs to double the number of doctors on duty during that time, or add an additional 15 doctors.\n\nTherefore, the additional number of doctors needed is 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
