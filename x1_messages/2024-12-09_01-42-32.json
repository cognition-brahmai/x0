        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company sells widgets for $20 each, and they have fixed costs of $10,000 per month. The variable cost per widget is $8. I need to figure out how many widgets they need to sell to break even. Okay, let's start by understanding what break-even means.\n\nBreak-even is when the total revenue equals the total costs. So, there's no profit, no loss. It's the point where the company covers all its expenses but doesn't make any extra money beyond that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for break-even analysis. I think it's something like:\n\nBreak-even point (in units) = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, in this case:\n\nFixed Costs = $10,000 per month\n\nSelling Price per Unit = $20\n\nVariable Cost per Unit = $8\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nBreak-even point = $10,000 / ($20 - $8) = $10,000 / $12 \u2248 833.33\n\nSince you can't sell a fraction of a widget, the company needs to sell at least 834 widgets to break even.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check this. Maybe I should verify it by calculating the total revenue and total costs at 834 widgets.\n\nTotal Revenue = Number of Units Sold * Selling Price per Unit\n\nTotal Variable Costs = Number of Units Sold * Variable Cost per Unit\n\nTotal Costs = Fixed Costs + Total Variable Costs\n\nSo, at 834 widgets:\n\nTotal Revenue = 834 * $20 = $16,680\n\nTotal Variable Costs = 834 * $8 = $6,672\n\nTotal Costs = $10,000 + $6,672 = $16,672\n\nSo, $16,680 - $16,672 = $8 profit. That's pretty close to break-even. If they sell one less, which is 833 widgets:\n\nTotal Revenue = 833 * $20 = $16,660\n\nTotal Variable Costs = 833 * $8 = $6,664\n\nTotal Costs = $10,000 + $6,664 = $16,664\n\n$16,660 - $16,664 = -$4 loss\n\nSo, at 833 widgets, they're losing $4, and at 834, they're making $8 profit. Therefore, 834 is indeed the break-even point, considering you can't sell a fraction of a widget.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using contribution margin or something like that.\n\nThe contribution margin per unit is Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit, which is $20 - $8 = $12, as I calculated earlier. Then, fixed costs divided by contribution margin per unit gives the break-even point in units, which is $10,000 / $12 \u2248 833.33, rounding up to 834.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation where Total Revenue = Total Costs.\n\nSo:\n\n20x = 10,000 + 8x\n\nWhere x is the number of widgets sold.\n\nSubtract 8x from both sides:\n\n12x = 10,000\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\nx = 10,000 / 12 \u2248 833.33\n\nAgain, rounding up to 834 widgets.\n\nI think this confirms it. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other costs that might be involved, like taxes or anything, but the problem only mentions fixed costs and variable costs per widget, so I think we're good.\n\nAnother way to look at it is the contribution margin ratio. Contribution Margin Ratio is (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit) / Selling Price per Unit = ($20 - $8) / $20 = $12 / $20 = 60%.\n\nThen, Break-even point in sales dollars = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio = $10,000 / 0.6 \u2248 $16,666.67\n\nThen, to find the number of units, divide the break-even sales dollars by the selling price per unit: $16,666.67 / $20 = 833.335, which again rounds up to 834 widgets.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 834 widgets as the break-even point.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's check the total contribution margin at 834 widgets.\n\nContribution Margin = Number of Units Sold * Contribution Margin per Unit = 834 * $12 = $10,008\n\nFixed Costs = $10,000\n\nSo, $10,008 - $10,000 = $8 profit, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAt 833 widgets:\n\nContribution Margin = 833 * $12 = $9,996\n\nFixed Costs = $10,000\n\n$9,996 - $10,000 = -$4 loss\n\nTherefore, the company needs to sell at least 834 widgets to cover its fixed and variable costs.\n\nI think this is solid. No issues here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{834} \\]"
