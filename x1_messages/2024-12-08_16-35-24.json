But the question is asking for the number of apples left, not oranges. So, adding oranges shouldn't affect the number of apples. Therefore, there are still 5 apples in the basket.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's a trick here that I'm not seeing. Let's think again. Initially, there are 10 apples. I take away 5 apples, which leaves 5 apples. Then, I add 6 oranges. Oranges are different from apples, so they don't change the apple count. So, the number of apples remains 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the act of adding oranges affects the apples in some way, but that seems unlikely. Maybe the basket has a certain capacity, but nothing in the problem suggests that. It seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to be tricky by mentioning both apples and oranges, but the key is to focus on what's being asked: the number of apples left. So, starting with 10 apples, taking away 5, leaves 5 apples. Adding oranges doesn't change that.\n\nAnother way to look at it: the total number of fruits in the basket initially is 10 apples. After taking away 5 apples, there are 5 apples left. Then, adding 6 oranges makes the total fruits 5 apples + 6 oranges = 11 fruits, but since the question asks for apples, it's still 5 apples.\n\nI think the answer is 5 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
