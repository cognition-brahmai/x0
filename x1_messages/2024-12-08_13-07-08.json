        "content": "Let's see. So, the question is: if a car travels at 60 miles per hour, how long will it take to travel 300 miles? Hmm, this seems like a straightforward problem involving speed, distance, and time. I remember there's a formula that connects these three: distance equals speed multiplied by time, or d = s * t. So, if I have the distance and the speed, I can rearrange the formula to solve for time, which would be t = d / s.\n\nPlugging in the values, that would be t = 300 miles / 60 miles per hour. Let's do the math: 300 divided by 60 is 5. So, it should take 5 hours to travel 300 miles at 60 miles per hour. That seems straightforward enough.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect the travel time. For example, are there stops along the way? Does the car maintain a constant speed the entire time? In real-life scenarios, there might be traffic, rest stops, or other delays. However, since the question doesn't mention any of these, I'll assume that the car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour without any stops.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. The speed is given in miles per hour and the distance in miles, so the time should come out in hours, which makes sense. If the units were different, I might need to do some conversions, but in this case, everything matches up nicely.\n\nLet me think about it differently to confirm. If the car travels 60 miles in one hour, then in two hours it would travel 120 miles, three hours for 180 miles, four hours for 240 miles, and five hours for 300 miles. Yeah, that matches up with the calculation I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use dimensional analysis to ensure that the units are correct. Starting with 300 miles divided by 60 miles per hour, that's like 300 miles / (60 miles/hour). Dividing miles by miles per hour, the miles cancel out, and I'm left with hours, which is the unit for time, as expected.\n\nIs there another way to look at this problem? Maybe using proportions. If 60 miles correspond to 1 hour, then 300 miles would correspond to x hours. So, I can set up a proportion: 60 miles / 1 hour = 300 miles / x hours. Cross-multiplying gives 60x = 300, and solving for x gives x = 5 hours again.\n\nAlright, so no matter how I approach this, I keep getting 5 hours as the answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of a different answer. For instance, if the speed wasn't constant, or if the car was accelerating, then the time might be different. However, the question specifies a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, so I don't need to account for acceleration or changing speeds.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Dividing 300 by 60 is straightforward, and it definitely equals 5. So, no issues there.\n\nAnother angle: if the speed was in a different unit, like miles per minute or something, I'd need to convert it to miles per hour. But here, it's already in miles per hour, so no conversion is needed.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
