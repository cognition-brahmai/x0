        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I'm dealt five cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and I need to find the probability that exactly one of those cards is a king. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, with 4 kings in total. I'm drawing five cards without replacement, which means once a card is drawn, it's not going back into the deck.\n\nTo find the probability of drawing exactly one king, I think I should use combinations because the order in which I draw the cards doesn't matter here.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw five cards from 52 is C(52, 5), where C(n, k) is the combination formula that calculates the number of ways to choose k items from n without regard to order.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, which are the hands with exactly one king.\n\nThere are 4 kings in the deck, so I need to choose exactly one of them. The number of ways to choose one king from four is C(4, 1).\n\nThen, since I'm drawing five cards in total, and one of them is a king, the remaining four cards must be non-kings. There are 52 - 4 = 48 non-king cards in the deck. So, the number of ways to choose four non-king cards from 48 is C(48, 4).\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes should be C(4, 1) * C(48, 4).\n\nFinally, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is [C(4, 1) * C(48, 4)] / C(52, 5).\n\nLet me calculate these values step by step.\n\nFirst, C(52, 5) = 52! / (5! * (52 - 5)!) = (52*51*50*49*48) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 2,598,960.\n\nNext, C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nThen, C(48, 4) = 48! / (4! * (48 - 4)!) = (48*47*46*45) / (4*3*2*1) = 194,580.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 * 194,580 = 778,320.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 778,320 / 2,598,960.\n\nLet's simplify this fraction.\n\nDividing both numerator and denominator by 4: 778,320 / 4 = 194,580 and 2,598,960 / 4 = 649,740.\n\nSo, 194,580 / 649,740.\n\nI can simplify further by dividing both by 194,580: 194,580 / 194,580 = 1 and 649,740 / 194,580 = 3.34 (approximately), but that doesn't seem right for simplification.\n\nWait, maybe I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 194,580 and 649,740.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as 194,580 / 649,740 and recognize that this reduces to approximately 0.2996, or about 29.96%.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express it as a fraction in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the original formula without calculating the large combinations.\n\nSo, P(exactly one king) = [C(4,1) * C(48,4)] / C(52,5).\n\nCalculating C(4,1) = 4, C(48,4) = 194,580, and C(52,5) = 2,598,960.\n\nSo, P = (4 * 194,580) / 2,598,960 = 778,320 / 2,598,960.\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 4: 778,320 / 4 = 194,580 and 2,598,960 / 4 = 649,740.\n\nNow, dividing numerator and denominator by 194,580: 194,580 / 194,580 = 1 and 649,740 / 194,580 = 3.34, which is not an integer, so perhaps I made a mistake in simplification.\n\nAlternatively, I can divide numerator and denominator by 120, which is 5 factorial.\n\nWait, but that might not be applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can leave it as 778,320 / 2,598,960, which simplifies to approximately 0.2996, or about 29.96%.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 30%.\n\nAlternatively, to get the exact fraction, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 194,580.\n\n778,320 \u00f7 194,580 = 4\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 194,580 = 13.35, which is not an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can divide numerator and denominator by 48, which is a common factor.\n\n778,320 \u00f7 48 = 16,215\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 48 = 54,145\n\nSo, 16,215 / 54,145.\n\nThis can be further simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 5.\n\n16,215 \u00f7 5 = 3,243\n\n54,145 \u00f7 5 = 10,829\n\nSo, 3,243 / 10,829.\n\nI'm not sure if this can be simplified further. Let's check if 3,243 and 10,829 have any common factors.\n\n3,243 divided by 3 is 1,081, and 10,829 divided by 3 is approximately 3,609.666, which is not an integer.\n\nSo, perhaps 3,243 / 10,829 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nC(52,5) = 2,598,960 is correct.\n\nC(4,1) = 4 is correct.\n\nC(48,4) = 194,580 is correct.\n\nSo, 4 * 194,580 = 778,320.\n\nTherefore, P = 778,320 / 2,598,960.\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 4: 778,320 / 4 = 194,580 and 2,598,960 / 4 = 649,740.\n\nNow, 194,580 and 649,740.\n\nGCD of 194,580 and 649,740.\n\nWell, 649,740 \u00f7 194,580 = 3.34, which is not an integer, so no common factor there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can divide numerator and denominator by 194,580.\n\nBut 649,740 \u00f7 194,580 = 3.34, again not an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can accept that 194,580 / 649,740 is the fraction, which is approximately 0.2996.\n\nSo, the probability is about 29.96%, or roughly 30%.\n\nAlternatively, to express it as a fraction, perhaps it's better to leave it as 778,320 / 2,598,960, acknowledging that it's approximately 0.3 or 30%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to simplify 778,320 / 2,598,960.\n\nLet's try dividing numerator and denominator by 120.\n\n778,320 \u00f7 120 = 6,486\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 120 = 21,658\n\nSo, 6,486 / 21,658.\n\nThis can be further simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2.\n\n6,486 \u00f7 2 = 3,243\n\n21,658 \u00f7 2 = 10,829\n\nSo, 3,243 / 10,829.\n\nThis seems to be the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the exact probability is 3,243 / 10,829.\n\nAlternatively, as a decimal, it's approximately 0.2996, or about 30%.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly one king in a five-card hand is roughly 30%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3243}{10829}} \\]"
