        "content": "So the population is increasing by 2% every year, and right now there are 50,000 people in the city. I need to find out what the population will be like in 10 years. Hmm, percentage increase over time, that sounds like something to do with compound interest or something similar. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that a 2% increase means that each year, the population goes up by 2% of the current population. So, it's not just 2% of the original population added each year, but 2% of whatever the population is at that time. That means it's compounding, like how interest accrues on money in a bank account.\n\nSo, maybe I can use the formula for compound interest to calculate this. The compound interest formula is:\n\n\\[A = P \\times (1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{n \\times t}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\(n\\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\(t\\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, the population is increasing by 2% each year, and it's compounded annually, so \\(n\\) would be 1. The rate \\(r\\) is 2%, which is 0.02 in decimal form. The initial population \\(P\\) is 50,000, and the time \\(t\\) is 10 years.\n\nSo, plugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[A = 50,000 \\times (1 + 0.02)^{10}\\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[1 + 0.02 = 1.02\\]\n\nSo now:\n\n\\[A = 50,000 \\times (1.02)^{10}\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(1.02\\) raised to the power of 10. Let's see:\n\n\\[1.02^{10} \\approx 1.21899\\]\n\nSo, multiplying that by the initial population:\n\n\\[A \\approx 50,000 \\times 1.21899 = 60,949.5\\]\n\nSince population can't be a fraction, I'll round it to the nearest whole number, which is 60,950.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this? Maybe using the formula for exponential growth?\n\nThe exponential growth formula is:\n\n\\[P(t) = P_0 \\times e^{rt}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(P(t)\\) is the population at time \\(t\\).\n\n- \\(P_0\\) is the initial population.\n\n- \\(r\\) is the growth rate.\n\n- \\(t\\) is time.\n\nBut in this case, since the growth is compounded annually at a fixed percentage, the first formula I used should be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the population year by year, applying the 2% increase each time. Let's try that to verify.\n\nStarting with 50,000.\n\nYear 1:\n\n\\[50,000 + (0.02 \\times 50,000) = 50,000 \\times 1.02 = 51,000\\]\n\nYear 2:\n\n\\[51,000 \\times 1.02 = 52,020\\]\n\nYear 3:\n\n\\[52,020 \\times 1.02 = 53,060.4 \\approx 53,060\\]\n\nYear 4:\n\n\\[53,060 \\times 1.02 = 54,121.2 \\approx 54,121\\]\n\nYear 5:\n\n\\[54,121 \\times 1.02 = 55,203.42 \\approx 55,203\\]\n\nYear 6:\n\n\\[55,203 \\times 1.02 = 56,307.06 \\approx 56,307\\]\n\nYear 7:\n\n\\[56,307 \\times 1.02 = 57,433.14 \\approx 57,433\\]\n\nYear 8:\n\n\\[57,433 \\times 1.02 = 58,581.66 \\approx 58,582\\]\n\nYear 9:\n\n\\[58,582 \\times 1.02 = 59,753.64 \\approx 59,754\\]\n\nYear 10:\n\n\\[59,754 \\times 1.02 = 60,949.08 \\approx 60,949\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, I get 60,949, which is very close to what I got earlier (60,950). The slight difference is probably due to rounding errors in each step.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that in 10 years, the population will be approximately 60,950.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect population growth, like migration or changes in the growth rate over time. However, based on the information provided, the growth rate is constant at 2% per year, and there's no mention of migration or other factors. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the growth is solely due to this annual percentage increase.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that population growth might not always follow a perfect compounded interest model, as real-world populations can be affected by various factors such as birth rates, death rates, migration, and so on. But for the purposes of this problem, we're given a simple annual growth rate, so using the compound interest formula is appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the population in 10 years will be approximately 60,950.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60950} \\]"
