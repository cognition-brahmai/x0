        "content": "So I've got this problem here: A company has 5 managers and 15 employees. I need to figure out in how many ways a committee of 6 people can be formed, but it must include at least 2 managers. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that \"at least 2 managers\" means that the committee can have 2, 3, 4, or even all 5 managers. So, I need to consider all these possibilities.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, when dealing with \"at least\" scenarios, it's often easier to calculate the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that don't meet the criteria. But in this case, since the restriction is that there must be at least 2 managers, I think it's simpler to directly calculate the number of committees with exactly 2, 3, 4, and 5 managers and then sum those up.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of possible committees of 6 people from the 20 people (5 managers + 15 employees) and then subtract the number of committees with fewer than 2 managers, i.e., committees with 0 or 1 manager. That might be more efficient.\n\nLet me consider both approaches and see which one I'm more comfortable with.\n\nFirst approach: directly calculating committees with at least 2 managers.\n\nSo, I need to calculate:\n\n- Number of committees with exactly 2 managers and 4 employees\n\n- Plus number of committees with exactly 3 managers and 3 employees\n\n- Plus number of committees with exactly 4 managers and 2 employees\n\n- Plus number of committees with exactly 5 managers and 1 employee\n\nWait, but the company only has 5 managers, so the maximum number of managers in the committee is 5.\n\nOkay, so for each of these cases, I can use combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose k managers from 5 is C(5, k), and the number of ways to choose the remaining (6 - k) employees from 15 is C(15, 6 - k).\n\nSo, the total number of committees with exactly k managers is C(5, k) * C(15, 6 - k).\n\nTherefore, the total number of committees with at least 2 managers is:\n\nSum from k=2 to k=5 of [C(5, k) * C(15, 6 - k)]\n\nNow, let's calculate each term:\n\nFor k=2: C(5,2) * C(15,4)\n\nC(5,2) = 10\n\nC(15,4) = 1365\n\nSo, 10 * 1365 = 13,650\n\nFor k=3: C(5,3) * C(15,3)\n\nC(5,3) = 10\n\nC(15,3) = 455\n\nSo, 10 * 455 = 4,550\n\nFor k=4: C(5,4) * C(15,2)\n\nC(5,4) = 5\n\nC(15,2) = 105\n\nSo, 5 * 105 = 525\n\nFor k=5: C(5,5) * C(15,1)\n\nC(5,5) = 1\n\nC(15,1) = 15\n\nSo, 1 * 15 = 15\n\nNow, summing these up: 13,650 + 4,550 + 525 + 15 = 18,740\n\nOkay, so according to this approach, there are 18,740 possible committees with at least 2 managers.\n\nNow, let's verify this using the alternative approach: total number of committees minus committees with fewer than 2 managers.\n\nTotal number of committees of 6 people from 20 people is C(20,6).\n\nC(20,6) = 38,760\n\nNow, committees with fewer than 2 managers mean committees with 0 or 1 manager.\n\nSo, number of committees with 0 managers and 6 employees: C(5,0) * C(15,6)\n\nC(5,0) = 1\n\nC(15,6) = 5,005\n\nSo, 1 * 5,005 = 5,005\n\nNumber of committees with 1 manager and 5 employees: C(5,1) * C(15,5)\n\nC(5,1) = 5\n\nC(15,5) = 3,003\n\nSo, 5 * 3,003 = 15,015\n\nTherefore, total number of committees with fewer than 2 managers is 5,005 + 15,015 = 20,020\n\nNow, subtract this from the total number of committees: 38,760 - 20,020 = 18,740\n\nOkay, so both approaches give the same result: 18,740.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to select at least 2 managers and fill the remaining spots with employees.\n\nSo, first, select 2 managers: C(5,2) = 10\n\nThen, select the remaining 4 committee members from the 15 employees: C(15,4) = 1,365\n\nSo, 10 * 1,365 = 13,650\n\nWait, but this only accounts for committees with exactly 2 managers. I need to account for committees with more than 2 managers.\n\nSo, this approach, as I did in the first method, needs to consider all possible numbers of managers from 2 to 5.\n\nTherefore, it's similar to the first approach I took.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut in this case, since the condition is simply \"at least 2 managers,\" the direct calculation or the subtraction method seems more straightforward.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently through two different methods, and both give me 18,740 as the number of possible committees.\n\nSo, the final answer is 18,740.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18740} \\]"
