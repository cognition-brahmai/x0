I remember seeing kids create castles, spaceships, and even replicas of real-world objects with them. It's pretty amazing how versatile they are. I've also heard that Legos encourage creativity and help develop fine motor skills in children. Plus, they've been around for a long time, so they must be doing something right. Have you ever played with Legos yourself?"
