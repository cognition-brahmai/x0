        "content": "So, the car factory makes 500 cars every day, and each car needs 4 tires. We want to know how many tires the factory should have in stock to keep making cars for 15 days without running out.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find out how many tires are used each day. Since each car needs 4 tires, and they make 500 cars a day, I can multiply 500 by 4 to get the daily tire usage.\n\nSo, 500 cars/day \u00d7 4 tires/car = 2,000 tires/day.\n\nThat means the factory uses 2,000 tires every day.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many tires are needed for 15 days. So, I'll multiply the daily tire usage by 15.\n\n2,000 tires/day \u00d7 15 days = 30,000 tires.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs to have 30,000 tires in stock to cover 15 days of production.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if they already have some tires in stock or if there's any waste or defects. However, the question doesn't mention anything about that, so I'll assume that the factory needs exactly 4 tires per car and that all tires are good.\n\nAlso, perhaps I should think about whether the factory operates every day for those 15 days. If there are weekends or holidays when the factory is closed, then the total number of tires needed would be less. But again, the question says \"per day\" and \"15 days of production,\" so I think it's safe to assume that it's 15 consecutive days of production.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory has any tires already in stock. If they already have some tires, they might not need to have 30,000 additional tires in stock. But since the question asks how many tires the factory needs to have in stock for 15 days of production, I think it's referring to the total stock required for that period.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory needs to have 30,000 tires in stock to maintain production for 15 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30000} \\]"
