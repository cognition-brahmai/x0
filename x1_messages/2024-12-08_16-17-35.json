        "content": "Let's see here. We have two trains, one leaving station A at 9 am going east at 60 mph, and another leaving station B at 10 am going west at 80 mph. The stations are 300 miles apart, and I need to figure out which train will be closer to station A when they meet.\n\nFirst, I need to determine when and where they meet. Since they're traveling towards each other, their speeds will add up relative to each other. The first train starts at 9 am, and the second at 10 am, so there's a one-hour difference.\n\nLet me calculate how far the first train travels in that one hour before the second train starts. Train A is going at 60 mph, so in one hour, it covers 60 miles. That means, at 10 am, when train B starts, the distance between them is 300 miles minus the 60 miles train A has already covered, which is 240 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other: train A at 60 mph and train B at 80 mph. Their relative speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph. So, they will cover the remaining 240 miles at 140 mph.\n\nTime taken to meet = distance / relative speed = 240 miles / 140 mph = 12/7 hours, which is approximately 1 hour and 43 minutes.\n\nSo, they meet at 10 am + 1 hour 43 minutes, which is around 11:43 am.\n\nNow, I need to find out how far each train has traveled by that time.\n\nFirst, train A started at 9 am and meets at 11:43 am. That's 2 hours and 43 minutes, which is 2 + 43/60 = 2.7167 hours.\n\nDistance covered by train A = speed * time = 60 mph * 2.7167 hours \u2248 163 miles.\n\nTrain B started at 10 am and meets at 11:43 am, which is 1 hour and 43 minutes, or 1 + 43/60 = 1.7167 hours.\n\nDistance covered by train B = 80 mph * 1.7167 hours \u2248 137 miles.\n\nNow, since train A is going east and train B is going west, and station A is the reference point, we need to see which train is closer to A when they meet.\n\nTrain A has traveled 163 miles east from A, and train B has traveled 137 miles west from B.\n\nBut wait, station B is 300 miles west of A. So, if train B travels 137 miles west from B, its position relative to A would be 300 + 137 = 437 miles west of A.\n\nSimilarly, train A is 163 miles east of A.\n\nSo, when they meet, train A is 163 miles east of A, and train B is 437 miles west of A.\n\nTherefore, train A is closer to station A when they meet.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't make sense because they are moving towards each other from stations that are 300 miles apart. If train A has gone 163 miles east and train B has gone 137 miles west, their positions should add up to more than 300 miles, which seems off.\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider the positions.\n\nLet me visualize this. Station A is at point A, station B is 300 miles west of A.\n\nTrain A leaves A at 9 am going east at 60 mph.\n\nTrain B leaves B at 10 am going west at 80 mph.\n\nWait, but if train A is going east from A, and train B is going west from B, they are actually moving away from each other, not towards.\n\nOh, that can't be right. Maybe I misread the directions.\n\nLet me check the question again: \"Another train leaves station B at 10 am traveling west at 80 mph.\" Wait, if station A and B are 300 miles apart, and train A is going east from A, and train B is going west from B, then yes, they are moving away from each other.\n\nBut the problem says \"when they meet.\" If they are moving away from each other, they won't meet unless one of them changes direction.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"A train leaves station A at 9 am traveling east at 60 mph. Another train leaves station B at 10 am traveling west at 80 mph. Station A and B are 300 miles apart. Which train will be closer to station A when they meet?\"\n\nHmm, if they are moving in opposite directions, away from each other, they won't meet unless one of them changes direction or something. Maybe I misread the directions.\n\nWait, perhaps train B is traveling east, not west. That would make more sense.\n\nLet me check again: \"traveling west at 80 mph.\" Oh, it says west. Maybe the stations are aligned east-west.\n\nSuppose station A is west, station B is east, 300 miles apart.\n\nTrain A leaves A at 9 am going east at 60 mph.\n\nTrain B leaves B at 10 am going west at 80 mph.\n\nIn this case, train A is going towards B, and train B is coming towards A.\n\nSo, they are moving towards each other.\n\nWait, but if A is going east and B is going west, and stations are 300 miles apart, with A west of B, then yes, they are moving towards each other.\n\nSo, my initial calculation might be correct.\n\nTrain A has a one-hour head start, covering 60 miles, so at 10 am, the distance between them is 240 miles.\n\nThen, their relative speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph, so time to meet is 240 / 140 = 12/7 hours, which is approximately 1 hour and 43 minutes, meeting at around 11:43 am.\n\nThen, train A has traveled for 2.7167 hours at 60 mph, covering about 163 miles.\n\nTrain B has traveled for 1.7167 hours at 80 mph, covering about 137 miles.\n\nNow, since train A is going east from A, and train B is going west from B, when they meet, their positions are:\n\nTrain A is 163 miles east of A.\n\nTrain B is 137 miles west of B.\n\nBut B is 300 miles east of A, so 137 miles west of B would be 300 - 137 = 163 miles east of A.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, both trains are at the same point, 163 miles east of A, which makes sense because they meet there.\n\nTherefore, when they meet, both trains are at the same location, 163 miles east of A.\n\nSo, both are equally close to A, at 163 miles.\n\nBut the question is, which train is closer to station A when they meet?\n\nWell, since both are at the same location, they are equally close to A.\n\nBut the answer options might suggest otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nTrain A travels for 2.7167 hours at 60 mph: 2.7167 * 60 = 163 miles.\n\nTrain B travels for 1.7167 hours at 80 mph: 1.7167 * 80 \u2248 137 miles.\n\nNow, since train A has traveled 163 miles east from A, and train B has traveled 137 miles west from B.\n\nBut B is 300 miles east of A.\n\nSo, train B's position relative to A is 300 - 137 = 163 miles east of A.\n\nYes, so both trains are at 163 miles east of A when they meet.\n\nTherefore, both are equally close to A, at 163 miles.\n\nSo, neither is closer; they are at the same distance from A.\n\nBut maybe the question is worded differently, or perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"when they meet\" refers to their positions at that time, and since they are at the same point, the distance to A is the same for both.\n\nTherefore, neither is closer; they are equally close to A.\n\nBut if I have to choose one, perhaps it's a trick question to see if you realize they are at the same point when they meet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation.\n\nLet me check the time calculation again.\n\nTrain A has a one-hour head start, covering 60 miles, so at 10 am, the distance between them is 240 miles.\n\nRelative speed is 140 mph, so time to meet is 240 / 140 = 12/7 hours, which is approximately 1 hour and 43 minutes.\n\nSo, meeting time is 10:00 am + 1 hour 43 minutes = 11:43 am.\n\nDistance covered by train A: 2.7167 hours * 60 mph = 163 miles.\n\nDistance covered by train B: 1.7167 hours * 80 mph = 137 miles.\n\nPosition of train A: 163 miles east of A.\n\nPosition of train B: 300 - 137 = 163 miles east of A.\n\nYes, same position.\n\nTherefore, both are equally close to A.\n\nI think the answer is that neither is closer; they are equally close to A at 163 miles.\n\nBut if I have to choose one, maybe the question expects \"both are at the same distance from A.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the directions are confusing.\n\nLet me consider station A and B being 300 miles apart, with train A going east from A at 60 mph, and train B going west from B at 80 mph.\n\nIf train A is going east from A, and train B is going west from B, then their paths are moving away from each other.\n\nWait, but if station A is west of station B, and train A is going east towards B, while train B is going west towards A, then they are moving towards each other.\n\nSo, their relative speed is indeed 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nDistance at 10 am is 240 miles, so time to meet is 240 / 140 = 12/7 hours.\n\nDistances traveled:\n\nTrain A: 60 * (1 + 12/7) = 60 * (7/7 + 12/7) = 60 * 19/7 \u2248 163 miles.\n\nTrain B: 80 * (12/7) \u2248 137 miles.\n\nPositions:\n\nTrain A: 163 miles east of A.\n\nTrain B: 300 - 137 = 163 miles east of A.\n\nYes, same position.\n\nTherefore, both are equally close to A.\n\nI think the answer is that neither is closer; they are at the same distance from A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Both trains are equally close to station A when they meet.}} \\]"
