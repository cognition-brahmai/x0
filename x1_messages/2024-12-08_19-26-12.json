        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about a farmer who has chickens and cows on his farm. The total number of animal heads is 50, and the total number of legs is 140. I need to figure out how many chickens and how many cows there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what's being asked. There are two types of animals: chickens and cows. Each has a certain number of heads and legs. Chickens have 1 head and 2 legs, right? And cows have 1 head and 4 legs. The total number of heads is 50, which means there are 50 animals in total because each animal has one head. The total number of legs is 140.\n\nSo, I need to find out how many of these 50 animals are chickens and how many are cows, given that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and altogether they have 140 legs.\n\nMaybe I can set up some equations to represent this situation. Let's define variables for the number of chickens and the number of cows. Let's say:\n\n- Let c be the number of chickens.\n\n- Let k be the number of cows.\n\nNow, since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is the sum of the number of chickens and cows, which is 50. So, I can write the first equation as:\n\nc + k = 50\n\nThat makes sense. Now, for the legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 140. So, the second equation should be:\n\n2c + 4k = 140\n\nOkay, now I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) c + k = 50\n\n2) 2c + 4k = 140\n\nI need to solve for c and k. I think I can use the substitution or elimination method. Maybe the elimination method is straightforward here.\n\nIf I take the first equation, c + k = 50, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for c:\n\nc = 50 - k\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for c into the second equation:\n\n2(50 - k) + 4k = 140\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\n100 - 2k + 4k = 140\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100 + 2k = 140\n\nNow, subtract 100 from both sides:\n\n2k = 40\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\nk = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 cows. Now, plug this back into the expression for c:\n\nc = 50 - 20 = 30\n\nTherefore, there are 30 chickens and 20 cows.\n\nWait, I should check if this makes sense. Total heads: 30 + 20 = 50, which matches. Total legs: 30 chickens * 2 legs = 60 legs, plus 20 cows * 4 legs = 80 legs, totaling 140 legs. Perfect, it checks out.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a different method or thinking about it differently.\n\nAnother approach could be to assume all animals are chickens or all are cows and then adjust based on the leg difference.\n\nFor example, if all 50 animals were chickens, they would have 50 * 2 = 100 legs. But the actual number of legs is 140, which is 40 legs more than 100.\n\nSince each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken, the difference of 40 legs must be due to the cows.\n\nSo, number of cows = 40 / 2 = 20 cows.\n\nThen, number of chickens = 50 - 20 = 30 chickens.\n\nThat's the same answer I got earlier, but using a different method. It's always good to cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, if I assumed all animals were cows, then 50 cows would have 50 * 4 = 200 legs. But the actual number is 140, which is 60 legs less than 200.\n\nEach chicken has 2 legs less than a cow, so the difference of 60 legs must be due to the chickens.\n\nTherefore, number of chickens = 60 / 2 = 30 chickens.\n\nThen, number of cows = 50 - 30 = 20 cows.\n\nAgain, the same result. It's reassuring that different methods lead to the same answer.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of averages. The average number of legs per animal is 140 legs / 50 animals = 2.8 legs per animal.\n\nSince chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, the average of 2.8 legs per animal suggests that the ratio of chickens to cows is such that the average is between 2 and 4, closer to 3.\n\nTo find the exact numbers, I can set up a proportion.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the proportion of chickens as p, and cows as 1 - p.\n\nThen, the average legs per animal is:\n\n2p + 4(1 - p) = 2.8\n\nLet\u2019s solve for p:\n\n2p + 4 - 4p = 2.8\n\n-2p + 4 = 2.8\n\n-2p = -1.2\n\np = 0.6\n\nSo, 60% of the animals are chickens, and 40% are cows.\n\nTherefore, number of chickens = 0.6 * 50 = 30\n\nNumber of cows = 0.4 * 50 = 20\n\nSame answer again. It's good to see consistency across different methods.\n\nPerhaps I can use matrices to solve the system of equations, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could graph the two equations and find the intersection point, but that's more time-consuming and less precise than algebraic methods.\n\nI think the methods I've used so far are sufficient and appropriate for this problem.\n\nLet me consider if there are any constraints or additional factors I should consider. For example, fractional animals don't make sense, so the numbers must be whole numbers. In this case, both 30 chickens and 20 cows are whole numbers, so that's fine.\n\nAlso, negative numbers of animals don't make sense, so the solutions must be non-negative. Here, both values are positive, so that's good.\n\nIs there any possibility of other types of animals or abnormal animals with different numbers of heads or legs? The problem specifies only chickens and cows, each with one head and the standard number of legs, so I don't need to consider that.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the problem could be extended or modified. For example, what if there were different types of animals or different numbers of heads and legs?\n\nBut for the given problem, I think I've found the correct answer using multiple methods, and it's consistent.\n\nSo, the farmer has 30 chickens and 20 cows.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ chickens and } 20 \\text{ cows}} \\]"
