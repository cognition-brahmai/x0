        "content": "The electric field \\(E\\) due to a point charge \\(q\\) at a distance \\(r\\) from the charge can be calculated using Coulomb's law. According to Coulomb's law, the electric field is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the charge. The formula for the electric field is:\n\n\\[E = k \\frac{q}{r^2}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(E\\) is the electric field strength in newtons per coulomb (N/C)\n\n- \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately \\(8.9875 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{C}^2\\)\n\n- \\(q\\) is the magnitude of the point charge in coulombs (C)\n\n- \\(r\\) is the distance from the point charge in meters (m)\n\nThis formula gives the magnitude of the electric field. The direction of the electric field depends on the sign of the charge:\n\n- If the charge is positive, the electric field points radially outward from the charge.\n\n- If the charge is negative, the electric field points radially inward toward the charge.\n\nIt's important to note that this formula assumes that the point charge is isolated and there are no other charges or fields interfering with it. In more complex scenarios with multiple charges, the electric field at a point is the vector sum of the electric fields due to each individual charge.\n\nAlso, this formula is derived from Gauss's law, which states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by the surface. For a point charge, the electric field is spherically symmetric, leading to the inverse square relationship with distance.\n\nIn practical applications, knowing the electric field due to a point charge is fundamental in understanding electrostatic phenomena, such as the behavior of charged particles in electric fields, capacitance, and electric potential.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\n\nSuppose we have a point charge of \\(q = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\) C, and we want to find the electric field at a distance of \\(r = 0.5\\) m from the charge.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[E = k \\frac{q}{r^2} = 8.9875 \\times 10^9 \\times \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}}{(0.5)^2} = 8.9875 \\times 10^9 \\times \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.25} = 8.9875 \\times 10^9 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-6} = 7.19 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{N/C}\\]\n\nSo, the electric field at 0.5 m from a 2 \u03bcC point charge is approximately \\(7.19 \\times 10^4\\) N/C, directed radially outward if the charge is positive.\n\n**Units and Dimensions:**\n\n- The unit of electric field is newtons per coulomb (N/C), which is equivalent to volts per meter (V/m).\n\n- The electric field can also be expressed in terms of its components in a coordinate system, especially in more complex scenarios.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- This formula is only accurate for static charges and does not account for time-varying electric or magnetic fields.\n\n- In relativistic scenarios where charges are moving at speeds\u63a5\u8fd1\u5149\u901f, the electric field must be calculated using special relativity and Maxwell's equations.\n\n- For continuous charge distributions, the electric field is calculated by integrating the contributions from infinitesimal charge elements.\n\n**Related Concepts:**\n\n- Electric potential: The electric potential \\(V\\) at a point is related to the electric field \\(E\\) by the gradient relationship: \\(E = -\\nabla V\\).\n\n- Electric flux: The electric flux through a surface is given by the surface integral of the electric field over that surface.\n\n- Gauss's law: A fundamental law in electrostatics that relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the total charge enclosed.\n\nUnderstanding the electric field due to a point charge is crucial for building a foundation in electromagnetism and is applicable in various fields such as physics, engineering, and materials science."
