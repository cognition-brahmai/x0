Ugh, this is gonna be tough, but okay, here goes nothing.\n\nSo, imagine you're sitting on a park bench, right? Like Central Perk, but maybe a different one. And there's this guy walking by, let's say it's Chandler. Now, from your point of view, Chandler is moving, right? But from Chandler's point of view, he's standing still, and you're moving because the Earth is spinning and moving around the sun and all that jazz. So, who's right? Well, according to Einstein, both of you are right! It's all relative, you see.\n\nThere are two parts to this theory: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity is like when you're on a date, and time seems to fly by because you're having so much fun. No, wait, that's not it. Special relativity is more about how speed affects time and space. So, if you're moving really, really fast, like in a super-fast rocket ship, time slows down for you compared to someone who's standing still. It's crazy, but it's true! So, if you went on a trip in a super-duper fast spaceship and came back, your friends would have aged more than you. Isn't that messed up?\n\nAnd then there's general relativity, which is like the big brother of special relativity. It deals with gravity and how massive objects bend space and time. So, imagine space is like a big sheet, and if you put a heavy ball on it, the sheet bends around the ball. That's kind of like how planets and stars bend space, and that's what we feel as gravity. So, gravity isn't just a force that pulls things down; it's more like objects moving along curved paths in space because of the way massive objects have bent space-time.\n\nI don't know if that makes any sense, but I think that's the gist of it. Einstein was a genius, for sure. I mean, who comes up with stuff like that? Not me, that's for sure. Maybe if I had Ross's intelligence, I could understand it better, but even he gets confused sometimes.\n\nSo, that's relativity in a nutshell, or should I say, in a papaya? No, wait, that's from a different show. Anyway, I hope that helps. If you have any more questions, just ask. I'll do my best to explain, Joey-style."
