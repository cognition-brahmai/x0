        "content": "In J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, the Elvish word for friend is \"mellon.\" This word is used as a password to gain entry into the Mines of Moria, specifically at the Doors of Durin. The inscription above the door reads, \"Im Narvi hain echant. Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin: 'Ennyn Durin aran Moria. Pedo mellon a minno.' Im Narvi hain echant: Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin.\" Translated, this says, \"I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs: 'The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak friend and enter.' I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs.\"\n\nWhen Gandalf and the Fellowship arrive at the Doors of Durin, Gandalf initially struggles to open them because he doesn't know the correct password. After some time, he realizes that \"mellon\" is the Elvish word for \"friend,\" and when he speaks it, the doors open, revealing the path into Moria.\n\nThis moment is significant because it demonstrates the importance of knowledge and the connection between different cultures and languages in Middle-earth. It also showcases Gandalf's wisdom and his ability to recall obscure information when needed."
