        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem about a farmer who has chickens and rabbits on his farm. Apparently, there are a total of 30 heads and 90 legs among them. I need to figure out how many chickens and how many rabbits there are.\n\nFirst, I know that both chickens and rabbits have one head each. So, if there are 30 heads, that means there are 30 animals in total, right? Now, chickens have 2 legs each, and rabbits have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 90.\n\nI think I can set up some equations to solve this. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of rabbits as R.\n\nSince both chickens and rabbits have one head each, and there are 30 heads, I can write:\n\nC + R = 30\n\nThat makes sense. Now, for the legs: chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from chickens would be 2C. Rabbits have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from rabbits would be 4R. The total number of legs is 90, so:\n\n2C + 4R = 90\n\nOkay, now I have two equations:\n\n1) C + R = 30\n\n2) 2C + 4R = 90\n\nI need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of C and R.\n\nOne way to do this is to solve the first equation for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for C:\n\nC = 30 - R\n\nNow, substitute this expression for C into the second equation:\n\n2(30 - R) + 4R = 90\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n60 - 2R + 4R = 90\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n60 + 2R = 90\n\nNow, subtract 60 from both sides:\n\n2R = 30\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nR = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 rabbits. Now, plug this back into the first equation to find C:\n\nC + 15 = 30\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\nC = 15\n\nWait, that can't be right. If there are 15 chickens and 15 rabbits, then the total number of legs would be:\n\nChickens: 15 * 2 = 30 legs\n\nRabbits: 15 * 4 = 60 legs\n\nTotal legs: 30 + 60 = 90 legs\n\nThat matches the given total. So, according to this, there are 15 chickens and 15 rabbits.\n\nBut, I'm a bit suspicious because it seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nIf there are 15 chickens and 15 rabbits, total heads are indeed 30. Total legs are 30 from chickens and 60 from rabbits, totaling 90 legs. It seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Perhaps using substitution isn't the best method, or maybe there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's assume all 30 animals are chickens. Then, the total number of legs would be 30 * 2 = 60 legs. But the actual total is 90 legs, which is 30 legs more than 60.\n\nNow, each rabbit has 2 more legs than a chicken. So, the difference of 30 legs must be due to the rabbits.\n\nTherefore, the number of rabbits is 30 / 2 = 15 rabbits.\n\nThen, the number of chickens is 30 - 15 = 15 chickens.\n\nThis matches my previous result. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume all animals are rabbits, then total legs would be 30 * 4 = 120 legs. But the actual total is 90 legs, which is 30 legs less than 120.\n\nEach chicken has 2 legs less than a rabbit. So, the difference of 30 legs must be due to the chickens.\n\nTherefore, the number of chickens is 30 / 2 = 15 chickens.\n\nThen, the number of rabbits is 30 - 15 = 15 rabbits.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nLet me try another method, maybe using matrices or something more advanced, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of averages.\n\nIf there are 30 animals and total legs are 90, then the average number of legs per animal is 90 / 30 = 3 legs per animal.\n\nNow, chickens have 2 legs and rabbits have 4 legs. So, the average of 3 legs per animal suggests a mix of chickens and rabbits.\n\nLet me consider the proportion of rabbits.\n\nIf R is the fraction of rabbits, then the average legs would be:\n\nAverage legs = (1 - R) * 2 + R * 4 = 2 + 2R\n\nSet this equal to 3:\n\n2 + 2R = 3\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n2R = 1\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nR = 0.5\n\nSo, 50% of the animals are rabbits, and 50% are chickens.\n\nTherefore, number of rabbits is 0.5 * 30 = 15 rabbits.\n\nNumber of chickens is 30 - 15 = 15 chickens.\n\nOnce again, the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that there are 15 chickens and 15 rabbits on the farm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThere are \\boxed{15} chickens and \\boxed{15} rabbits."
