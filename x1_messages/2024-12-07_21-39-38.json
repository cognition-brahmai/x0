        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls there are in the school.\n\nThe school has 800 students, and 60% of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:\n\nNumber of boys = 60% of 800 = 0.60 \u00d7 800 = 480 boys\n\nSince the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 800 - 480 = 320 girls\n\nNext, we need to find out how many boys and girls participate in sports.\n\n40% of the boys participate in sports, so:\n\nNumber of boys in sports = 40% of 480 = 0.40 \u00d7 480 = 192 boys\n\n30% of the girls participate in sports, so:\n\nNumber of girls in sports = 30% of 320 = 0.30 \u00d7 320 = 96 girls\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who participate in sports, we add the number of boys and girls in sports:\n\nTotal students in sports = Number of boys in sports + Number of girls in sports = 192 + 96 = 288 students\n\nSo, 288 students in total participate in sports.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]"
