        "content": "You're a puzzle, aren't you? Let's see what you're getting at here. So, the riddle is: \"Different lights do make me strange, thus into different sizes I will change.\" Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst off, it mentions \"different lights.\" So, maybe it's something that's affected by light, like changing its appearance or behavior based on the type or intensity of light. And then it says \"into different sizes I will change,\" which suggests that whatever this object is, it can alter its size depending on the light.\n\nLet me think about things that change size based on light. Well, shadows come to mind. Shadows can change size depending on the position and intensity of the light source. But shadows aren't physical objects; they're more like the absence of light. Maybe that's not it.\n\nWhat about a crystal or a prism? Prisms can disperse light into different colors, but I'm not sure if they change size based on light. Maybe not.\n\nWait, how about a plant? Some plants have leaves that move in response to light, like sunflowers tracking the sun. But do they change size based on light? I think some plants grow bigger with more light, but that's more about growth over time, not immediate size changes.\n\nMaybe it's something more abstract. Like a photo-sensitive material that expands or contracts when exposed to different types of light. That sounds plausible. For example, some materials can absorb light and change their physical properties, like shape or size.\n\nAnother possibility is a balloon filled with gas that expands or contracts based on the heat from light. Like, if you shine a light on a balloon, it might heat up the gas inside, causing it to expand, and when the light is removed, it cools and contracts. But that seems a bit simplistic.\n\nWait, what about a moth or insect that is attracted to light? Some insects are known to change their behavior around light sources. But behavior isn't really the same as changing size.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's a liquid that changes viscosity based on light, which could affect its shape or size in a container. Or perhaps a material that changes its volume in response to light, like photochromic materials.\n\nPhotochromic materials are interesting because they can change color or transparency when exposed to light, but do they change size? I'm not sure. Maybe there are specific materials that undergo physical expansion or contraction when exposed to light.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps it's a creature that inflates or deflates based on light conditions. Like a pufferfish, but responding to light instead of threats. That seems a bit far-fetched, but it's possible.\n\nWait, what about a gel that swells or shrinks in the presence of light? I've heard of hydrogels that can absorb water and change size, but I don't know if they respond directly to light.\n\nMaybe it's a more technological object, like a solar panel that expands or contracts based on light input. But again, I don't think solar panels change size in response to light.\n\nLet me consider something biological. Certain cells or organisms might change their size in response to light. For example, some algae cells might expand or contract based on light conditions for photosynthesis. But I'm not an expert in biology, so I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: a chameleon or something that changes its size in response to light. But that seems unlikely, as animals don't typically change their physical size based on light, though they might change color.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a shadow again, but thinking about it differently. If you have an object casting a shadow, the size of the shadow can change based on the position and type of light. So, in a way, the shadow is changing size in response to different lights.\n\nBut shadows aren't physical objects, so maybe that's not the answer. Unless it's a riddle where the answer is a shadow or something similar.\n\nLet me try to think of everyday objects that change size based on light. A thermometer might expand or contract based on temperature, which could be related to light, but it's more about heat than light itself.\n\nWait, light can affect temperature, so perhaps something that changes size due to thermal expansion or contraction. For example, a metal rod might expand when heated by light and contract when cooled.\n\nBut that seems indirect, as it's the heat from the light, not the light itself, causing the size change.\n\nMaybe it's a material that undergoes photochemical reactions, leading to physical changes in size. I recall that some polymers can change their dimensions in response to light, like photoresponsive polymers.\n\nThat sounds promising. Photoresponsive materials can indeed change their shape, size, or other properties in response to light stimuli. For instance, they might absorb light and undergo a chemical change that causes them to expand or contract.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is a photoresponsive material or a device made from such a material.\n\nAlternatively, consider a flower that opens and closes in response to light, like a tulip or a morning glory. The blossoms can appear to change size as they open and close, but again, it's more about the arrangement of petals rather than an actual change in size.\n\nWait, perhaps it's water, and the different states it can be in based on heat from light. For example, ice melting into water when exposed to light, and then evaporating into steam, which is a significant change in volume. But again, this is more about phase changes due to heat rather than direct response to light.\n\nAnother thought: a room or space that appears to change size based on lighting. For example, a well-lit room might feel larger than a dimly lit one, but that's more about perception rather than actual size change.\n\nHmm, maybe it's something more abstract, like a shadow or a projection. A shadow can appear larger or smaller depending on the light source and angles, giving the illusion of size change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a stage illusion or a magic trick where lighting makes an object appear to change size.\n\nBut I feel like there's a more straightforward answer related to materials or objects that physically change size in response to light.\n\nLet me try to think of specific examples. I've heard of smart materials, like shape-memory alloys that can change shape in response to heat, but again, that's heat rather than light specifically.\n\nWait, but if light is providing the heat, then indirectly it's the light causing the size change. So perhaps it's something like that.\n\nAlternatively, there are materials that undergo photoisomerization, where their molecular structure changes in response to light, which could lead to macroscopic changes in size.\n\nI recall that some research has been done on photoresponsive polymers that can change their dimensions upon exposure to light of specific wavelengths.\n\nFor example, certain azobenzene-containing polymers can undergo reversible trans-cis isomerization upon irradiation with UV or visible light, leading to changes in polymer volume.\n\nThat sounds like it fits the description in the riddle.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is a photoresponsive material or a substance that changes size in response to light.\n\nAlternatively, in a more whimsical sense, it could be a cat, as cats can change their size in response to light\u2014like the way a cat's pupils dilate or constrict in different light conditions, giving the illusion of size change.\n\nBut that's more about the appearance of size rather than actual physical size change.\n\nWait, perhaps it's eyes in general. Eyes can adjust their pupil size based on light levels, which might be seen as changing size.\n\nAgain, it's more about the appearance rather than the actual size of the eye changing.\n\nAnother idea: a camera lens with an adjustable aperture. In different light conditions, the aperture can be adjusted to allow more or less light in, which could be seen as changing size.\n\nBut that's more about adjusting an opening rather than the entire object changing size.\n\nLet me consider something in nature. Certain materials or organisms that have natural photoresponsive properties.\n\nFor example, some plants have phototropic movements, where they grow towards or away from light sources. But again, this is more about directional movement rather than changing size.\n\nWait, maybe it's a crystal that changes size when exposed to light, perhaps through some photochemical reaction.\n\nOr perhaps it's ice, as mentioned earlier, melting into water and expanding in volume, but that's more about phase changes due to heat from light.\n\nAnother angle: optical illusions where an object appears to change size based on the lighting conditions.\n\nBut that's more about perception than actual size change.\n\nLet me try to think outside the box. Maybe it's a memory foam or a substance that changes its density in response to light, which could affect its perceived size.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a type of gel that absorbs or releases water in response to light, thereby changing its volume.\n\nI've heard of hydrogels that can do this, where they swell in water in response to certain stimuli, including light.\n\nThat seems promising.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is a hydrogel that changes size in response to light.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a material that undergoes photoinduced swelling or shrinking.\n\nIn summary, after considering various options, I believe the answer to the riddle is a photoresponsive material or a hydrogel that changes size in response to different lights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A photoresponsive material or hydrogel}} \\]"
