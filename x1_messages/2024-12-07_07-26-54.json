        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have books costing $12 each and CDs costing $8 each, and the total spent is $100. We need to find out how many different combinations of books and CDs can add up to $100.\n\nFirst, let's set up an equation to represent this situation. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- \\( b \\) is the number of books.\n\n- \\( c \\) is the number of CDs.\n\nThe total cost equation would be:\n\n\\[ 12b + 8c = 100 \\]\n\nOur goal is to find all the non-negative integer solutions for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the equation to make it easier to work with. Notice that both 12 and 8 are divisible by 4, so let's divide the entire equation by 4:\n\n\\[ 3b + 2c = 25 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find integer values for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\nOne approach is to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ 2c = 25 - 3b \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{25 - 3b}{2} \\]\n\nSince \\( c \\) must be an integer, \\( 25 - 3b \\) must be even. That means \\( 3b \\) must be odd for \\( 25 - 3b \\) to be even, because 25 is odd. Since 3 is odd, \\( b \\) must be odd for \\( 3b \\) to be odd.\n\nSo, \\( b \\) must be an odd integer.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values for \\( b \\). Since \\( b \\) represents the number of books, it must be a non-negative integer (\\( b \\geq 0 \\)).\n\nAdditionally, since \\( 3b \\leq 25 \\) (from \\( 3b + 2c = 25 \\)), \\( b \\) can be at most \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{25}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\).\n\nSo, possible values for \\( b \\) are the odd integers from 0 to 8, which are: 1, 3, 5, 7.\n\nLet's check each of these:\n\n1. \\( b = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{25 - 3(1)}{2} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11 \\]\n\n2. \\( b = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{25 - 3(3)}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\]\n\n3. \\( b = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{25 - 3(5)}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\]\n\n4. \\( b = 7 \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{25 - 3(7)}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n- 1 book and 11 CDs\n\n- 3 books and 8 CDs\n\n- 5 books and 5 CDs\n\n- 7 books and 2 CDs\n\nWait a minute, let's check if \\( b = 0 \\) could be a possibility. Although \\( b \\) must be odd, 0 is even. But according to our earlier reasoning, \\( b \\) must be odd for \\( 3b \\) to be odd, which is necessary for \\( 25 - 3b \\) to be even, so \\( c \\) is integer. Therefore, \\( b = 0 \\) is not acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, \\( b = 2 \\) is even, so \\( 3(2) = 6 \\), which is even, and \\( 25 - 6 = 19 \\), which is odd, so \\( c = \\frac{19}{2} \\) is not an integer. Hence, \\( b = 2 \\) is invalid.\n\nThe same logic applies to \\( b = 4 \\), \\( b = 6 \\), and \\( b = 8 \\), as they are even numbers, leading to non-integer values for \\( c \\).\n\nTherefore, only \\( b = 1, 3, 5, 7 \\) are valid, giving us four combinations.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other possible odd values for \\( b \\) beyond 7. The next odd number after 7 is 9, but \\( 3(9) = 27 \\), which is greater than 25, so \\( b = 9 \\) is not acceptable since it would result in a negative number of CDs.\n\nHence, there are only four possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, we could have approached this by solving for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ 3b = 25 - 2c \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{25 - 2c}{3} \\]\n\nFor \\( b \\) to be an integer, \\( 25 - 2c \\) must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet\u2019s consider \\( c \\) as a non-negative integer and find values of \\( c \\) such that \\( 25 - 2c \\) is divisible by 3.\n\nLet\u2019s find \\( c \\) such that:\n\n\\[ 25 - 2c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\]\n\n\\[ 25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\]\n\n\\[ 2c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\]\n\n\\[ c \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( c \\) must be of the form \\( 3k + 2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nNow, let's find the possible values of \\( c \\):\n\nGiven that \\( c \\geq 0 \\), and \\( c = 3k + 2 \\), we can substitute back into the equation to find corresponding \\( b \\).\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{25 - 2c}{3} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( c = 3k + 2 \\):\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{25 - 2(3k + 2)}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{25 - 6k - 4}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{21 - 6k}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ b = 7 - 2k \\]\n\nSince \\( b \\) must be non-negative, \\( 7 - 2k \\geq 0 \\), which implies \\( k \\leq 3.5 \\). Since \\( k \\) is an integer, \\( k \\leq 3 \\).\n\nSo, possible values for \\( k \\) are 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. \\( k = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ c = 3(0) + 2 = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 7 - 2(0) = 7 \\]\n\n2. \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ c = 3(1) + 2 = 5 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 7 - 2(1) = 5 \\]\n\n3. \\( k = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ c = 3(2) + 2 = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 7 - 2(2) = 3 \\]\n\n4. \\( k = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ c = 3(3) + 2 = 11 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 7 - 2(3) = 1 \\]\n\nThese match the combinations we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, there are four possible combinations.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- 7 books and 2 CDs\n\n- 5 books and 5 CDs\n\n- 3 books and 8 CDs\n\n- 1 book and 11 CDs\n\nThus, the customer can choose from four different combinations to spend exactly $100 on books and CDs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
