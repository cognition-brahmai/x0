        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a car rental company has 12 cars available for rent, and each car can be rented for either one day, three days, or seven days. The question is, how many different ways can all the cars be rented out?\n\nHmm, let's see. Each car has three choices for rental periods: 1 day, 3 days, or 7 days. And there are 12 cars, all of which need to be assigned one of these rental periods.\n\nWait a minute, is this a problem about combinations or permutations? Well, since we're assigning a rental period to each car, and the cars are distinct (even if they're identical, each one is a separate entity), it seems like we're dealing with permutations where repetition is allowed.\n\nLet me think about it differently. For each car, there are 3 choices independent of the others. So, for car 1, 3 options; car 2, another 3 options, and so on, up to car 12.\n\nSo, the total number of ways should be 3 raised to the power of 12, right? Because for each car, there are 3 choices, and there are 12 cars.\n\nLet me write that down: total ways = 3^12.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there aren't any constraints or complications I'm missing. The problem says \"all the cars be rented out,\" which means that every car must be assigned one of the three rental periods, and none can be left unrented.\n\nI don't think there are any other constraints mentioned, so this should be straightforward.\n\nAlright, so 3^12 is 531,441.\n\nBut maybe I should consider whether the order matters. In other words, does the sequence of rental periods matter, or just the number of cars rented for each period?\n\nWell, since each car is distinct, the sequence does matter. For example, assigning a 1-day rental to car 1 and a 3-day rental to car 2 is different from assigning 3 days to car 1 and 1 day to car 2.\n\nSo, indeed, it's 3^12.\n\nAlternatively, if the cars were indistinguishable, and we only cared about how many cars are rented for each period, then it would be a different problem, involving combinations.\n\nBut in this case, since each car is separate, it's 3^12.\n\nLet me double-check by considering a smaller number of cars. Suppose there were only 2 cars.\n\nEach car has 3 choices: 1, 3, or 7 days.\n\nSo, total ways: 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. Car 1: 1 day, Car 2: 1 day\n\n2. Car 1: 1 day, Car 2: 3 days\n\n3. Car 1: 1 day, Car 2: 7 days\n\n4. Car 1: 3 days, Car 2: 1 day\n\n5. Car 1: 3 days, Car 2: 3 days\n\n6. Car 1: 3 days, Car 2: 7 days\n\n7. Car 1: 7 days, Car 2: 1 day\n\n8. Car 1: 7 days, Car 2: 3 days\n\n9. Car 1: 7 days, Car 2: 7 days\n\nYes, that's 9 ways, which is 3^2.\n\nSo, for 12 cars, it should be 3^12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 531,441 different ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{531441} \\]"
