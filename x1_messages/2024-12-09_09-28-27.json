While it's a common belief that the Great Wall is visible from space, the reality is a bit more nuanced. Under ideal conditions, such as low orbit and with the right\u89d2\u5ea6 and lighting, parts of the Great Wall can be seen with the naked eye. However, it's not as prominent as some might think, and other man-made structures can also be visible from space under similar conditions.\n\nIt's important to note that from a higher altitude, like that of the International Space Station, the Great Wall is much harder to see without visual aids. So, while it's possible to see it from space, it's not as straightforward as some popular beliefs suggest.\n\nENDASSISTANT"
