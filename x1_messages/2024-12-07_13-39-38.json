        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which are 120 miles apart. It travels at a constant speed initially and takes 2 hours to go halfway. Then it increases its speed by 50% for the remaining half. I need to find out the total time for the entire journey.\n\nFirst, halfway between Town A and Town B is 60 miles, right? Because 120 miles divided by 2 is 60 miles.\n\nThe train takes 2 hours to cover the first 60 miles. So, its initial speed is distance divided by time, which is 60 miles divided by 2 hours. That's 30 miles per hour.\n\nNow, for the second half of the journey, the train increases its speed by 50%. So, its new speed is 30 miles per hour plus 50% of 30 miles per hour. Fifty percent of 30 is 15, so the new speed is 30 + 15 = 45 miles per hour.\n\nNow, it needs to cover the remaining 60 miles at 45 miles per hour. Time is distance divided by speed, so time for the second half is 60 miles divided by 45 miles per hour. Let me calculate that: 60 divided by 45 is 4/3 hours, which is 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nWait, but I need to add this to the initial 2 hours to get the total time for the entire journey. So, 2 hours plus 1 hour and 20 minutes is 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check that. First half: 60 miles at 30 mph takes 2 hours. Second half: 60 miles at 45 mph takes 60/45 = 4/3 hours, which is indeed 1 hour and 20 minutes. So total time is 2 hours + 1 hour 20 minutes = 3 hours 20 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3\\ \\text{hours}\\ 20\\ \\text{minutes}} \\]"
