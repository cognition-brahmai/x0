        "content": "The famous 19th-century painting 'Starry Night' was painted by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh while he was in an asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France. The painting was created in 1889 and is now housed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Van Gogh suffered from mental illness throughout his life and was admitted to the asylum in May 1889 after experiencing a breakdown. During his time there, he created some of his most iconic works, including 'Starry Night.' The painting is known for its swirling skies, bold colors, and emotional intensity, and is considered one of the greatest works of art in history."
