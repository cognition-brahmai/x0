Here's a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sumEvenNumbers(arr) {\n    return arr.filter(num => num % 2 === 0).reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` method to create a new array containing only the even numbers from the input array. Then, it uses the `reduce` method to calculate the sum of the even numbers in the filtered array, starting with an initial value of 0.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\nconst sum = sumEvenNumbers(numbers);\nconsole.log(sum); // Output: 12 (2 + 4 + 6 = 12)\n```\n\nYou can pass any array of integers to this function, and it will return the sum of all the even numbers in that array."
