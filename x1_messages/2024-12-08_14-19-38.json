        "content": "Let's see. The plane is flying at an average speed of 500 miles per hour and needs to cover a distance of 1,750 miles. To find out how long the flight will take, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 1,750 miles / 500 miles per hour\n\nThat gives:\n\nTime = 3.5 hours\n\nNow, the plane takes off at 9:00 AM. To find out the arrival time, I need to add 3.5 hours to the takeoff time.\n\nFirst, let's handle the whole hours. 3 hours added to 9:00 AM brings us to 12:00 PM.\n\nThen, there's an additional 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes.\n\nSo, adding 30 minutes to 12:00 PM gives us an arrival time of 12:30 PM.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 9:00 AM:\n\n- After 1 hour: 10:00 AM\n\n- After 2 hours: 11:00 AM\n\n- After 3 hours: 12:00 PM\n\n- And then half an hour more: 12:30 PM\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in minutes to confirm.\n\nTotal flight time is 3.5 hours, which is 3 hours and 30 minutes, or 210 minutes.\n\nStarting at 9:00 AM, adding 210 minutes:\n\n- 60 minutes take us to 10:00 AM\n\n- Another 60 minutes to 11:00 AM\n\n- Another 60 minutes to 12:00 PM\n\n- And the remaining 30 minutes take us to 12:30 PM\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, if I convert everything to a 24-hour format:\n\n9:00 AM is 09:00 hours.\n\nAdding 3 hours: 09:00 + 03:00 = 12:00\n\nAdding 30 minutes: 12:00 + 00:30 = 12:30\n\nStill the same.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the arrival time.\n\nFor example, is there any information about time zones, layovers, or flight delays?\n\nThe question says the plane takes off at 9:00 AM and flies directly to its destination without any stops, at a constant average speed of 500 mph.\n\nSo, no time zone changes, no stops, constant speed.\n\nTherefore, the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the plane's speed and the distance, there might be a need to account for factors like wind resistance or variations in speed, but the problem states an average speed, so I think using that average speed is appropriate.\n\nAlso, in real life, planes have taxi times before takeoff and after landing, but since those aren't specified, I'll assume that the takeoff time includes all pre-flight procedures.\n\nSo, sticking with the given information, the flight time is 3.5 hours, and the takeoff is at 9:00 AM, leading to an arrival time of 12:30 PM.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the plane's speed in more detail.\n\nThe average speed is 500 miles per hour.\n\nDoes that include all phases of flight, or just the cruising speed?\n\nIn reality, planes accelerate during takeoff and climb, then cruise at a higher speed, and decelerate during descent.\n\nBut since the problem specifies an average speed over the entire journey, I think it's safe to use that figure directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plane doesn't fly at a constant speed, but since it's given as an average, the variation should be accounted for in that average.\n\nSo, no need to adjust for speed changes.\n\nTherefore, the initial calculation stands: 1,750 miles / 500 mph = 3.5 hours.\n\nAdd 3.5 hours to 9:00 AM: 12:30 PM.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's try another approach.\n\nLet's use the formula for time again, but this time, let's solve for time step by step.\n\nFirst, find out how many hours are in 1,750 miles at 500 mph.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 1,750 / 500 = 3.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, 1,750 divided by 500 is the same as 1,750 / 500.\n\n500 goes into 1,750 three times (500 * 3 = 1,500), with a remainder of 250.\n\n250 is half of 500, so that's 0.5 hours.\n\nThus, total time is 3.5 hours.\n\nAdding that to 9:00 AM:\n\n9:00 AM + 3 hours = 12:00 PM\n\n12:00 PM + 30 minutes = 12:30 PM\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using proportional reasoning.\n\nIf 500 miles are covered in 1 hour, then 1,750 miles would be covered in 1,750 / 500 = 3.5 hours.\n\nAgain, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nI think it's clear that the arrival time is 12:30 PM.\n\nBut just to cover all bases, perhaps consider if the plane flies faster or slower at certain times, but since it's an average speed, variations should even out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the plane's speed in knots, but the problem uses miles and miles per hour, so it's consistent.\n\nAlso, ensure that the time zone is the same for departure and arrival, but since it's not specified otherwise, assuming it's the same time zone.\n\nTherefore, no adjustment is needed.\n\nHence, the final answer is 12:30 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12:30 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
