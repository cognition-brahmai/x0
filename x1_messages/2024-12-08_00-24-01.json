        "content": "So the train is going at different speeds for different amounts of time, right? I need to find out how far it travels in total. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, it travels at 90 kilometers per hour for 2 hours. To find the distance for this part, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 90 km/h \u00d7 2 h = 180 kilometers\n\nThen, it slows down to 60 kilometers per hour for 1.5 hours. Let's use the same formula for this part:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 60 km/h \u00d7 1.5 h\n\nHmm, what's 60 times 1.5? Let's see, 60 times 1 is 60, and 60 times 0.5 is 30, so total 90 kilometers.\n\nSo, Distance\u2082 = 90 kilometers\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 180 km + 90 km = 270 kilometers\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using average speed or something like that?\n\nLet me see. The total time traveled is 2 hours plus 1.5 hours, which is 3.5 hours.\n\nIf I could find the overall average speed, then multiply by total time, that might give me the same result.\n\nBut to find the overall average speed, it's total distance divided by total time. Wait, that's actually what I have already: total distance is 270 km, total time is 3.5 hours, so average speed would be 270 divided by 3.5.\n\nLet me calculate that: 270 \u00f7 3.5\n\nWell, 3.5 times 70 is 245, and 270 minus 245 is 25. So, 70 plus 25/3.5.\n\n25 divided by 3.5 is, let's see, 3.5 times 7 is 24.5, so that's about 7.14.\n\nSo, average speed is approximately 77.14 km/h.\n\nBut actually, I don't need to find the average speed; I just needed to find the total distance, which I already have as 270 kilometers.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating things. The straightforward approach is best here: add up the distances from each part of the trip.\n\nSo, final answer: 270 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
