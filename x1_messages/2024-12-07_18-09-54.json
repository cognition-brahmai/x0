        "content": "Let's see. So, the store sells bags of candy, and each bag has 12 pieces of candy. They sell 25 of these bags every day. I need to find out how many individual pieces of candy they sell in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many pieces of candy are sold each day. Since each bag has 12 pieces and they sell 25 bags daily, I can multiply 12 by 25 to get the daily total.\n\nSo, 12 pieces per bag times 25 bags equals... let's calculate that.\n\n12 times 25 is 300. So, they sell 300 pieces of candy each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly total, I need to multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, 300 pieces per day times 7 days equals... 300 times 7.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 300 times 7 is 2,100.\n\nTherefore, the store sells 2,100 individual pieces of candy in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a easier way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total pieces of candy as the product of the number of pieces per bag, the number of bags per day, and the number of days per week.\n\nSo, that would be 12 pieces/bag times 25 bags/day times 7 days/week.\n\nSo, 12 times 25 times 7.\n\nI already did 12 times 25 is 300, and then 300 times 7 is 2,100.\n\nAlternatively, I could do it differently. Maybe multiply 25 bags by 7 days first, and then multiply by 12 pieces.\n\nSo, 25 bags/day times 7 days is 175 bags/week.\n\nThen, 175 bags times 12 pieces/bag is... 175 times 12.\n\nLet me calculate that. 175 times 10 is 1,750, and 175 times 2 is 350. So, 1,750 plus 350 is 2,100.\n\nSo, again, I get 2,100 pieces per week.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to check it another way, maybe I can think about how many pieces are sold in a week directly.\n\nBut I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2,100 pieces of candy sold in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2100} \\]"
