Here's a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `factorial(n)`, where `n` is the number you want to calculate the factorial of. For example, `factorial(5)` would return 120."
