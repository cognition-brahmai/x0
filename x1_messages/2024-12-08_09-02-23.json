        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 3 red balls and 5 blue balls, making a total of 8 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacement, both of them are red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I pick the first ball, I don't put it back into the box before picking the second ball. So, the total number of balls decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nNow, the probability of both events happening is the probability of the first event multiplied by the probability of the second event given that the first one has already happened. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the probability that the first ball I pick is red. There are 3 red balls out of 8 total balls, so that's 3/8.\n\nNext, given that the first ball was red, there are now 2 red balls left and a total of 7 balls remaining in the box. So, the probability that the second ball is also red is 2/7.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is (3/8) * (2/7).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(3/8) * (2/7) = (3*2)/(8*7) = 6/56 = 3/28.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/28.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use combinations. The total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 8 is \"8 choose 2\", which is calculated as 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = (8*7)/2 = 28.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of 3 is \"3 choose 2\", which is 3! / (2! * (3-2)!) = (3*2)/2 = 3.\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 3/28.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using probabilities directly.\n\nThe probability that the first ball is red is 3/8.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 7 balls left, with 2 red ones.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is red given that the first one was red is 2/7.\n\nMultiplying them gives (3/8)*(2/7) = 6/56 = 3/28.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nWhat if I consider the probability that the first ball is red and the second ball is red without considering the order?\n\nWait, in combinations, order doesn't matter, which is why we use \"choose\" functions.\n\nIn permutations, order matters.\n\nBut in this case, since we're picking without replacement and interested in both being red without specifying the order, combinations seem appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider permutations, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls in order from 8 is 8*7=56.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red balls in order is 3*2=6.\n\nSo, the probability is 6/56=3/28.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLooks like no matter how I approach it, I get 3/28.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this, but it's always good to verify in multiple ways to be sure.\n\nIs there any other approach I can take to confirm this?\n\nLet's think about it using the concept of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that both balls are red is equal to the probability that the first ball is red and the second ball is red.\n\nWhich is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nWhere A is \"first ball is red\", and B is \"second ball is red given that the first was red\".\n\nWe already calculated P(A) = 3/8 and P(B|A) = 2/7, so P(A and B) = (3/8)*(2/7) = 3/28.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think it's clear now that the probability is indeed 3/28.\n\nMaybe I can try plugging in the numbers differently to see if I get the same result.\n\nSuppose I consider the probability that the first ball is blue or red, but since we're interested in both being red, maybe that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability that the first ball is red and the second ball is not red, and then subtract that from the probability that the first ball is red.\n\nBut that seems more complicated and might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability that at least one ball is red, but that's not directly helpful here.\n\nI think sticking with the initial approach is best.\n\nSo, to summarize, the probability that both balls picked are red is 3/28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{28}} \\]"
