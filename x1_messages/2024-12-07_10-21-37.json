        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To create a JavaScript function that checks if a string is a valid IP address, we need to ensure that the string follows the standard IP address format. A valid IP address consists of four numbers separated by periods, where each number is between 0 and 255.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Split the string by periods**: A valid IP should have exactly four parts.\n2. **Check each part**: Each part should be a number between 0 and 255.\n3. **Handle leading zeros**: Leading zeros are allowed only if the number is 0 itself.\n\nLet's write the function accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to validate whether a given string is a valid IP address. A valid IP address consists of four numbers separated by periods, with each number ranging from 0 to 255. Leading zeros are only allowed for the number 0.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Split the string**: Split the input string by periods to get an array of parts.\n2. **Check the number of parts**: Ensure there are exactly four parts.\n3. **Validate each part**:\n   - Each part must be a number.\n   - Each number must be between 0 and 255.\n   - If a part has leading zeros, it must be exactly \"0\".\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction isValidIP(str) {\n    // Split the string by periods\n    const parts = str.split('.');\n    \n    // There should be exactly four parts\n    if (parts.length !== 4) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    for (let part of parts) {\n        // Check if the part is a number\n        if (isNaN(part) || part.trim() !== part) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        \n        // Convert part to integer\n        const num = parseInt(part, 10);\n        \n        // Check if the number is between 0 and 255\n        if (num < 0 || num > 255) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        \n        // Check for leading zeros\n        if (part.length > 1 && part[0] === '0') {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Split the string by periods**: This gives us an array of parts that should represent the four octets of the IP address.\n2. **Check for exactly four parts**: If there are more or fewer than four parts, the string is not a valid IP address.\n3. **Validate each part**:\n   - Ensure each part is a number and doesn't contain any non-digit characters.\n   - Convert each part to an integer and check if it is within the range 0 to 255.\n   - Ensure there are no leading zeros unless the part is exactly \"0\".\n\nThis approach ensures that the IP address is valid according to the standard format."
