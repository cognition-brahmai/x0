        "content": "The principle that states the total linear momentum of a closed system is constant unless acted upon by an external force is known as the Principle of Conservation of Momentum. So, the correct answer is A. The Principle of Conservation of Momentum.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, momentum is a measurement involving mass in motion, defined as the product of the mass and velocity of an object. The principle of conservation of momentum essentially means that in a closed system (one that is not affected by external forces), the total momentum remains constant over time. This principle is fundamental in physics and is used in various applications, from collisions in sports to understanding the movements of planets.\n\nOption B, Newton's Third Law, states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. While this law is related to forces and interactions between objects, it doesn't directly state the conservation of momentum.\n\nOption C, the Principle of Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This is a separate conservation law from that of momentum.\n\nOption D, Hooke's Law, describes the relationship between the force applied to a spring and its extension or compression. It's not related to the conservation of momentum.\n\nSo, in summary, if you have a closed system where no external forces are acting, the total momentum of that system will remain constant, which is the Principle of Conservation of Momentum."
