        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many units the factory produces in a week. Since it produces 120 units every day and operates seven days a week, the weekly production would be:\n\n120 units/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 840 units/week\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total production cost for these 840 units. The production cost per unit is $25, so:\n\n840 units \u00d7 $25/unit = $21,000\n\nNow, let's find out how much revenue the factory generates from selling these 840 units. Each unit is sold for $40, so:\n\n840 units \u00d7 $40/unit = $33,600\n\nProfit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So, the profit for the week would be:\n\n$33,600 (revenue) - $21,000 (cost) = $12,600\n\nTherefore, the profit generated by the factory in one week is $12,600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12600} \\]"
