        "content": "So the factory currently produces 1000 widgets per day, and they're planning to increase that by 25%. I need to figure out how many widgets they'll produce after this increase.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 25% increase means. Percentage increase is calculated based on the original amount, right? So, 25% of 1000 widgets will be added to the original production.\n\nTo find 25% of 1000, I can multiply 1000 by 0.25 because 25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal form.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 1000 times 0.25 equals 250 widgets.\n\nSo, the increase is 250 widgets per day.\n\nNow, to find the total production after the increase, I need to add this increase to the original production.\n\nThat would be 1000 plus 250, which equals 1250 widgets per day.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 25% of 1000 is indeed 250.\n\nAdding that to the original 1000 gives 1250.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the new amount by multiplying the original amount by 1 plus the percentage increase in decimal form.\n\nSo, that would be 1000 times 1.25.\n\nLet me try that: 1000 times 1.25 equals 1250.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 1250 widgets per day after the 25% increase.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose the factory increases production by 25%, but maybe they have constraints like labor limits or machine capacity. But based on the information given, we're assuming that they can actually achieve this increase.\n\nAlso, the question doesn't mention any limitations or additional factors, so I'm going to stick with the straightforward calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1250 widgets per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1250} \\]"
