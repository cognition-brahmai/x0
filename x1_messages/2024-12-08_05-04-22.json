I've always wanted to visit there someday. The way the city is built on water is just so unique and fascinating. I've seen pictures of the Grand Canal and St. Mark's Square, and it looks absolutely beautiful, especially during the carnival season with all the masks and costumes. I heard that the Venice Film Festival is also held there, which must be an amazing experience. Overall, Venice seems like a romantic and historic place that everyone should try to see at least once in their lifetime."
