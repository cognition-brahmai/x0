        "content": "Let's see. There's a group of 200 people, and their eye colors are divided like this: 60% have brown eyes, 30% have blue eyes, and 10% have green eyes. The question is asking how many more people have brown eyes than blue eyes.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many people have brown eyes and how many have blue eyes. Then, I can subtract the number of blue-eyed people from the number of brown-eyed people to find the difference.\n\nStarting with brown eyes: 60% of 200 people have brown eyes. To find out how many that is, I can calculate 60% of 200.\n\nPercentage is per hundred, so 60% is the same as 60/100 or 0.6. Multiplying that by 200 gives:\n\n0.6 \u00d7 200 = 120\n\nSo, 120 people have brown eyes.\n\nNext, for blue eyes: 30% of 200 people have blue eyes. Again, 30% is 30/100 or 0.3. Multiplying by 200:\n\n0.3 \u00d7 200 = 60\n\nSo, 60 people have blue eyes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more people have brown eyes than blue eyes, I subtract the number of blue-eyed people from the number of brown-eyed people:\n\n120 - 60 = 60\n\nTherefore, there are 60 more people with brown eyes than blue eyes.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by finding the difference in percentages first and then applying that to the total number of people.\n\nLet's try that. The percentage difference between brown and blue eyes is 60% - 30% = 30%. Then, 30% of 200 people would be:\n\n0.3 \u00d7 200 = 60\n\nWhich matches the previous result. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also check the number of people with green eyes. 10% of 200 is:\n\n0.1 \u00d7 200 = 20\n\nSo, 20 people have green eyes.\n\nAdding up all the people: 120 (brown) + 60 (blue) + 20 (green) = 200, which matches the total number of people in the group.\n\nThis confirms that my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 60 more people have brown eyes than blue eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]\n"
