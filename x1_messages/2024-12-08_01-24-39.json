        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. I have a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and I'm drawing 5 cards at random without replacement. I need to find the probability of getting exactly 3 face cards\u2014those are kings, queens, and jacks\u2014and 2 non-face cards.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many face cards are in the deck. Face cards are kings, queens, and jacks, and there are 4 of each in a standard deck. So, 4 kings + 4 queens + 4 jacks equals 12 face cards in total.\n\nNow, the total number of cards is 52, so the number of non-face cards is 52 - 12 = 40.\n\nI need to draw exactly 3 face cards and 2 non-face cards. Since I'm drawing without replacement, the order doesn't matter; it's combinations we're dealing with here, not permutations.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 face cards out of 12 is C(12, 3), and the number of ways to choose 2 non-face cards out of 40 is C(40, 2). The total number of ways to choose 5 cards out of 52 is C(52, 5).\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That is:\n\nProbability = [C(12, 3) * C(40, 2)] / C(52, 5)\n\nNow, I need to calculate these combinations.\n\nC(n, k) is calculated as n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSo, C(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * 9!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 220\n\nC(40, 2) = 40! / (2! * 38!) = (40 \u00d7 39) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 780\n\nC(52, 5) = 52! / (5! * 47!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 2,598,960\n\nNow, plug these values back into the probability formula:\n\nProbability = (220 * 780) / 2,598,960\n\nFirst, multiply 220 by 780:\n\n220 * 780 = 171,600\n\nNow, divide that by 2,598,960:\n\n171,600 / 2,598,960 \u2248 0.066037\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n0.066037 * 100 \u2248 6.6037%\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 6.60%.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, C(12, 3):\n\n12 choose 3 is indeed 220.\n\nC(40, 2):\n\n40 choose 2 is 780, that's correct.\n\nC(52, 5):\n\n52 choose 5 is 2,598,960, which is right.\n\nMultiplying 220 by 780 gives 171,600.\n\nDividing that by 2,598,960 gives approximately 0.066037, which is about 6.60%.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the fraction before multiplying to make sure.\n\nSo, C(12, 3) = 220\n\nC(40, 2) = 780\n\nC(52, 5) = 2,598,960\n\nSo, probability = (220 * 780) / 2,598,960\n\nI can divide numerator and denominator by 20 to simplify:\n\nNumerator: 220 / 20 = 11, and 780 / 20 = 39, so 11 * 39 = 429\n\nDenominator: 2,598,960 / 20 = 129,948\n\nSo, probability = 429 / 129,948\n\nNow, let's see if this can be simplified further. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n429 \u00f7 3 = 143\n\n129,948 \u00f7 3 = 43,316\n\nSo, 143 / 43,316\n\nNow, check if 143 and 43,316 have any common factors. 143 is 11 \u00d7 13, and 43,316 divided by 11 is 3,938, and 3,938 divided by 13 is approximately 303, so they don't share any common factors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is 143 / 43,316.\n\nNow, dividing 143 by 43,316 gives approximately 0.003301, but wait, that seems off because earlier I had approximately 0.066. Wait a minute, I must have made a mistake in my simplification.\n\nLet me check that again.\n\nStarting with (220 * 780) / 2,598,960\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n220 / 20 = 11\n\n780 / 20 = 39\n\nBut 2,598,960 / 20 = 129,948\n\nSo, it's (11 * 39) / 129,948 = 429 / 129,948\n\nNow, divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n429 \u00f7 3 = 143\n\n129,948 \u00f7 3 = 43,316\n\nSo, 143 / 43,316\n\nNow, 143 is 11 \u00d7 13, and 43,316 divided by 11 is 3,938, and 3,938 divided by 13 is approximately 303, but 303 isn't an integer, so no common factors. So, 143 / 43,316 is the simplified fraction.\n\nNow, dividing 143 by 43,316 gives approximately 0.003301, but earlier I had 0.066037. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial multiplication.\n\nLet me recalculate (220 * 780):\n\n220 * 780:\n\n200 * 780 = 156,000\n\n20 * 780 = 15,600\n\nTotal = 156,000 + 15,600 = 171,600\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, 171,600 / 2,598,960 = approximately 0.066037\n\nBut according to my simplification, it's 143 / 43,316, which is approximately 0.003301. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I simplified incorrectly.\n\nWait, 220 * 780 = 171,600\n\n2,598,960 divided by 20 is 129,948\n\nSo, 171,600 / 2,598,960 = 171,600 \u00f7 20 = 8,580\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 20 = 129,948\n\nSo, it should be 8,580 / 129,948\n\nNow, divide numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n8,580 \u00f7 12 = 715\n\n129,948 \u00f7 12 = 10,829\n\nSo, 715 / 10,829\n\nNow, check if 715 and 10,829 have any common factors.\n\n715 is 5 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13\n\n10,829 divided by 11 is 984.4545..., not an integer.\n\nDivided by 13 is approximately 833, again not an integer.\n\nSo, 715 / 10,829 is the simplified fraction.\n\nNow, dividing 715 by 10,829 gives approximately 0.066037, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.066037, or 6.6037%.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a fraction: 715 / 10,829.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps I can look for another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to think about the probability step by step, considering the draws without replacement.\n\nThe probability of drawing 3 face cards and 2 non-face cards in any order.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to draw 5 cards from 52 is C(52, 5), which is 2,598,960.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is C(12, 3) * C(40, 2), which is 220 * 780 = 171,600.\n\nSo, probability = 171,600 / 2,598,960 \u2248 0.066037, or about 6.60%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nThe probability of drawing 3 face cards and 2 non-face cards is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 face cards from 12 and 2 non-face cards from 40, divided by the total number of ways to choose any 5 cards from 52.\n\nThis aligns with my initial approach.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 6.60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.066037} \\]"
