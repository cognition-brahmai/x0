        "content": "Let's see... there's this snail trying to climb up a 30-foot wall. Each day, it climbs up 5 feet during the daytime but then slides down 3 feet at night. I need to figure out how many days it will take for the snail to reach the top.\n\nFirst, I should understand the net progress the snail makes each day. During the day, it climbs up 5 feet, but at night, it slides down 3 feet. So, the net gain each day is 5 feet minus 3 feet, which is 2 feet per day.\n\nNow, if the snail makes 2 feet of progress each day, I might be tempted to just divide the total height of the wall by the daily progress: 30 feet divided by 2 feet per day, which equals 15 days. But I need to think if that's really accurate.\n\nWait a minute, on the last day of climbing, when the snail reaches the top during the daytime, it won't slide back down at night because it's already at the top. So, on the final day, it only climbs up without sliding back.\n\nSo, I need to consider that on the last day, the snail climbs the remaining distance without sliding back. Let's think about that.\n\nSuppose the snail needs to climb 30 feet, and it makes 2 feet of net progress each day, but on the last day, it climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nLet me calculate how much it climbs before the last day. Let's say on the day before the last day, the snail climbs up to a certain height, and then on the last day, it climbs the remaining distance to reach the top.\n\nSo, if on the last day, it climbs 5 feet during the day and doesn't slide back, then as long as the remaining distance is less than or equal to 5 feet, it will reach the top on that day.\n\nSo, I need to find out on which day the snail reaches or exceeds the top during its daytime climb.\n\nLet's consider that each full day (day and night) it makes a net progress of 2 feet. But on the last day, it doesn't slide back.\n\nSo, perhaps I should calculate how much it needs to climb before the last day.\n\nLet's subtract the daytime climb on the last day from the total height: 30 feet minus 5 feet = 25 feet.\n\nNow, the snail needs to reach 25 feet after considering the net progress of 2 feet per day.\n\nSo, 25 feet divided by 2 feet per day equals 12.5 days.\n\nSince the snail can't climb half a day, I'll round up to 13 full days.\n\nSo, in 13 full days, the snail climbs 13 days * 2 feet per day = 26 feet.\n\nWait, but I subtracted 5 feet already, so adding back the 5 feet climbed on the last day would make it 26 + 5 = 31 feet, which is more than the wall's height.\n\nBut the wall is only 30 feet, so perhaps I need to adjust my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it differently.\n\nEach full day (day and night), the snail makes a net progress of 2 feet, but on the last day, it only climbs up without sliding back.\n\nSo, for the first few days, it makes 2 feet of progress per day, and on the last day, it climbs the remaining distance.\n\nI need to find out after how many full days of net 2 feet per day, the remaining distance is less than or equal to 5 feet, so that on the next day, it can climb the remaining distance in the daytime without sliding back.\n\nSo, after how many days will the snail be at a height where, after sliding down 3 feet at night, it is less than 5 feet from the top.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the height at the end of each day.\n\nLet me create a table to track the snail's progress day by day.\n\nLet's say at the start, day 0, height is 0 feet.\n\nThen, each day:\n\n- During the day, it climbs up 5 feet.\n\n- During the night, it slides down 3 feet.\n\nSo, net progress per day is 2 feet.\n\nBut on the last day, it doesn't slide back.\n\nSo, I need to find the first day where, after climbing during the day, it reaches or exceeds the top.\n\nLet me iterate day by day.\n\nDay 1:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 0 + 5 = 5 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 5 - 3 = 2 feet.\n\nDay 2:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 2 + 5 = 7 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 7 - 3 = 4 feet.\n\nDay 3:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 4 + 5 = 9 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 9 - 3 = 6 feet.\n\nDay 4:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 6 + 5 = 11 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 11 - 3 = 8 feet.\n\nDay 5:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 8 + 5 = 13 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 13 - 3 = 10 feet.\n\nDay 6:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 10 + 5 = 15 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 15 - 3 = 12 feet.\n\nDay 7:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 12 + 5 = 17 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 17 - 3 = 14 feet.\n\nDay 8:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 14 + 5 = 19 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 19 - 3 = 16 feet.\n\nDay 9:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 16 + 5 = 21 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 21 - 3 = 18 feet.\n\nDay 10:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 18 + 5 = 23 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 23 - 3 = 20 feet.\n\nDay 11:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 20 + 5 = 25 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 25 - 3 = 22 feet.\n\nDay 12:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 22 + 5 = 27 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 27 - 3 = 24 feet.\n\nDay 13:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 24 + 5 = 29 feet.\n\n- Slide down 3 feet at night: 29 - 3 = 26 feet.\n\nDay 14:\n\n- Climb up 5 feet during the day: 26 + 5 = 31 feet.\n\n- Since it reaches 31 feet, which is above the top, it has reached the top by the end of day 14.\n\nBut wait, on day 14, it climbs up to 31 feet during the day, which is beyond the top, so it reaches the top on day 14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it reaches the top on day 13, but let's check.\n\nAt the end of day 13, after sliding down, it's at 26 feet.\n\nOn day 14, it climbs up 5 feet during the day: 26 + 5 = 31 feet, which is above the top, so it reaches the top on day 14.\n\nTherefore, it takes 14 days for the snail to reach the top of the 30-foot wall.\n\nWait, but I think there might be a more efficient way to calculate this without listing each day.\n\nLet me try to generalize the approach.\n\nThe snail makes a net progress of 2 feet per day, except on the last day, when it climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nSo, I can think of it as the snail needing to reach a point where, on the next day, its daytime climb will take it to or past the top.\n\nSo, if the wall is 30 feet, and on the last day, it climbs 5 feet during the day, then the snail needs to be at or above 25 feet at the start of the last day (because 25 + 5 = 30 feet).\n\nBut wait, 25 feet is the height it needs to reach at the end of the previous day, after sliding down.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nAt the end of each day (after sliding down at night), the snail is at a certain height.\n\nThen, on the next day, it climbs up 5 feet during the day.\n\nSo, to reach the top on a certain day, at the start of that day, before climbing, it needs to be at a height where climbing 5 feet will take it to or past 30 feet.\n\nSo, if it needs to reach 30 feet, then at the start of the day, it needs to be at or above 25 feet (since 25 + 5 = 30).\n\nBut at the start of the day, it has already slid down at night from the previous day.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the height at the start of each day.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s define the height at the start of day n.\n\nAt the start of day 1, height is 0 feet.\n\nThen, during day 1, it climbs up 5 feet: 0 + 5 = 5 feet.\n\nAt night, it slides down 3 feet: 5 - 3 = 2 feet.\n\nSo, at the start of day 2, it's at 2 feet.\n\nDuring day 2, it climbs up 5 feet: 2 + 5 = 7 feet.\n\nAt night, slides down 3 feet: 7 - 3 = 4 feet.\n\nAt the start of day 3: 4 feet.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI see a pattern: at the start of day n, height is 2(n-1) feet.\n\nWait, from day 1 start: 0 feet.\n\nDay 2 start: 2 feet.\n\nDay 3 start: 4 feet.\n\nDay 4 start: 6 feet.\n\nSo, yes, at the start of day n, height is 2(n-1) feet.\n\nThen, during day n, it climbs up 5 feet: height becomes 2(n-1) + 5 feet.\n\nThen, at night, it slides down 3 feet: height becomes 2(n-1) + 5 - 3 = 2(n-1) + 2 = 2n feet.\n\nSo, at the start of day n+1, it's at 2n feet.\n\nThis matches the earlier observations.\n\nNow, on the last day, let's say day k, it climbs up 5 feet during the day and reaches or surpasses 30 feet.\n\nSo, at the start of day k, its height is 2(k-1) feet.\n\nThen, during day k, it climbs up 5 feet: 2(k-1) + 5 feet.\n\nThis needs to be at least 30 feet.\n\nSo, 2(k-1) + 5 >= 30.\n\nLet's solve for k:\n\n2(k-1) + 5 >= 30\n\n2(k-1) >= 25\n\nk-1 >= 12.5\n\nSince k must be an integer, k-1 >= 13\n\nTherefore, k >= 14\n\nSo, on day 14, the snail reaches or surpasses 30 feet.\n\nTherefore, it takes 14 days for the snail to reach the top of the wall.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider that the snail needs to reach a height where, after climbing during the day, it reaches or exceeds the top.\n\nSo, the snail climbs 5 feet during the day and slides back 3 feet at night, making a net progress of 2 feet per day, except on the last day.\n\nSo, for the first few days, it makes 2 feet of progress per day, and on the last day, it climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nSo, if I subtract the last day's climb from the total height, I can calculate how many full days are needed to reach a height where the last day's climb will take it to the top.\n\nSo, total height is 30 feet.\n\nAssume that on the last day, it climbs 5 feet.\n\nSo, before the last day, it needs to reach at least 25 feet.\n\nBut, each full day, it makes 2 feet of progress.\n\nSo, to reach 25 feet, number of full days needed is ceiling of 25 divided by 2, which is 12.5, rounded up to 13 days.\n\nThen, on day 14, it climbs the remaining 5 feet to reach 30 feet.\n\nTherefore, it takes 14 days.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it takes 14 days, and this confirms it.\n\nHowever, let's check if on day 13, it actually reaches or exceeds 25 feet.\n\nAt the start of day 13, its height is 2*(13-1) = 2*12 = 24 feet.\n\nDuring day 13, it climbs up 5 feet: 24 + 5 = 29 feet.\n\nAt night, it slides down 3 feet: 29 - 3 = 26 feet.\n\nThen, on day 14, at the start, it's at 26 feet.\n\nDuring day 14, it climbs up 5 feet: 26 + 5 = 31 feet, which is above the top.\n\nSo, it reaches the top on day 14.\n\nAlternatively, if the wall is 30 feet, and on day 13, it reaches 29 feet during the day, then slides back to 26 feet at night.\n\nOn day 14, it climbs up 5 feet during the day: 26 + 5 = 31 feet, which is above 30 feet, so it reaches the top on day 14.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 14 days.\n\nBut let me consider if there's a general formula for this.\n\nSuppose the wall is h feet high, the snail climbs u feet during the day, and slides down d feet at night, with u > d.\n\nEach full day, the net progress is (u - d) feet.\n\nOn the last day, it climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nSo, to find the number of days, we can calculate how many full days are needed to reach a height where, on the next day, the snail can climb the remaining distance to reach the top.\n\nSo, the height after n full days is n*(u - d).\n\nThen, on the (n+1)th day, it climbs u feet, so the total height is n*(u - d) + u.\n\nWe need this to be at least h.\n\nSo, n*(u - d) + u >= h.\n\nSolve for n:\n\nn >= (h - u)/(u - d).\n\nSince n must be an integer, we take the ceiling of (h - u)/(u - d).\n\nThen, the total number of days is n + 1.\n\nWait, let's verify this with the current values.\n\nGiven h = 30, u = 5, d = 3.\n\nSo, n >= (30 - 5)/(5 - 3) = 25/2 = 12.5.\n\nCeiling of 12.5 is 13.\n\nThen, total days = 13 + 1 = 14 days.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, in general, the number of days is ceiling((h - u)/(u - d)) + 1.\n\nTherefore, for this problem, it takes 14 days for the snail to reach the top of the 30-foot wall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
