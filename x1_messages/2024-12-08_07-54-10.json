        "content": "So, there are 8 boys and 12 girls in the classroom. To find the probability of randomly selecting a girl, I need to know how many girls there are compared to the total number of students.\n\nFirst, I should find the total number of students in the class. That would be the sum of boys and girls, so 8 boys plus 12 girls equals 20 students in total.\n\nNow, probability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is selecting a girl, and the total possible outcomes are selecting any student.\n\nSo, the probability P of selecting a girl is P(girl) = number of girls / total number of students = 12 / 20.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives me 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal by dividing 12 by 20, which equals 0.6.\n\nAnd to express it as a percentage, I can multiply the decimal by 100, so 0.6 times 100 equals 60%.\n\nSo, the probability of randomly selecting a girl from the class is 3/5, or 0.6, or 60%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there any other way to look at this?\n\nAnother way to think about probability is to consider the ratio of girls to the whole class. Since there are 12 girls out of 20 students, yes, that's still 12/20, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability of not selecting a girl, which would be selecting a boy. The number of boys is 8, so P(boy) = 8/20 = 2/5 = 0.4 = 40%.\n\nAnd since P(girl) + P(boy) should equal 1, because those are the only two possibilities, let's check: 3/5 + 2/5 = 5/5 = 1. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the probability of selecting a girl is 3/5 or 60%.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Is there anything else I need to consider here?\n\nWell, perhaps I should make sure that the selection is truly random. Assuming that every student has an equal chance of being selected, then this calculation holds.\n\nIf there were some bias in the selection process, then the probability might be different, but since the problem states \"randomly selecting,\" I can assume that it's an unbiased selection.\n\nAlso, I should note that this is the theoretical probability. In practice, if I were to conduct multiple trials of selecting a student, the actual proportion of times a girl is selected might approach 60% as the number of trials increases, according to the law of large numbers.\n\nBut for a single selection, the probability remains 3/5.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The probability of randomly selecting a girl from the class is 3/5, or 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
