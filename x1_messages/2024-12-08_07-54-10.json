        "content": "So I have this problem: \"In how many ways can you choose a committee of 4 people out of a group of 10 people?\" Hmm, this sounds like a combination problem, right? Because the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter; it's just about selecting a group of 4 from 10.\n\nI remember that combinations are calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which means the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nSo, in this case, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\). Plugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 4) = \\frac{10!}{4!(10 - 4)!} = \\frac{10!}{4! \\cdot 6!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate the factorials. Let's see:\n\n\\[\n10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3,628,800\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging these back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 4) = \\frac{3,628,800}{24 \\times 720}\n\\]\n\nFirst, multiply 24 and 720:\n\n\\[\n24 \\times 720 = 17,280\n\\]\n\nNow, divide 3,628,800 by 17,280:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3,628,800}{17,280} = 210\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to choose a committee of 4 people from a group of 10.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to calculate this without computing such large factorials? Because handling such large numbers can be cumbersome and error-prone.\n\nI recall that sometimes we can simplify the calculation by canceling out terms in the numerator and the denominator. Let's try that.\n\nStarting again with:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 4) = \\frac{10!}{4! \\cdot 6!}\n\\]\n\nBut \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6! \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 4) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{4! \\times 6!}\n\\]\n\nThe \\( 6! \\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 4) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4!}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 4! = 24 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 4) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{24}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n\\[\n90 \\times 8 = 720\n\\]\n\n\\[\n720 \\times 7 = 5,040\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by 24:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5,040}{24} = 210\n\\]\n\nAgain, we get 210. This seems more manageable than calculating the full factorials.\n\nIs there another way to look at this problem to confirm the answer? Maybe using permutations instead of combinations.\n\nWait, but permutations take order into account, right? In this case, order doesn't matter, so combinations are the way to go. But just for kicks, let's see what permutations would give us.\n\nThe formula for permutations is:\n\n\\[\nP(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(10, 4) = \\frac{10!}{6!} \\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\nP(10, 4) = \\frac{3,628,800}{720} = 5,040\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 5,040 ways to arrange 4 people out of 10 if order matters. But since in a committee, order doesn't matter, we need to divide this by the number of ways to arrange 4 people, which is \\( 4! = 24 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{P(10, 4)}{4!} = \\frac{5,040}{24} = 210 \\), which matches our previous result.\n\nAlright, that's reassuring.\n\nIs there another approach altogether? Maybe using binomial coefficients or Pascal's triangle?\n\nYes, combinations are often represented in Pascal's triangle. The binomial coefficient \\( C(n, k) \\) is the entry in the nth row and kth column of Pascal's triangle.\n\nFor \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\), we can look up or calculate the binomial coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, binomial coefficients satisfy the identity:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k)\n\\]\n\nBut calculating through recursion might be more tedious for larger n and k.\n\nAnother way is to use the multiplicative formula for combinations:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n \\times (n - 1) \\times \\cdots \\times (n - k + 1)}{k!}\n\\]\n\nWhich is essentially what we did earlier:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 4) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4!} = \\frac{5,040}{24} = 210\n\\]\n\nSo, all these methods lead us to the same answer: 210.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any restrictions or special conditions in the problem that we might have missed.\n\nThe problem says: \"choose a committee of 4 people out of a group of 10 people.\" It doesn't mention any restrictions, such as certain people not being able to serve together or any specific roles within the committee. So, it's a straightforward combination problem.\n\nIf there were restrictions, we might need to adjust our calculation accordingly, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nAlso, just to make sure, let's consider a smaller example to see if our method works.\n\nSuppose we have 4 people and we want to choose a committee of 2. Using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nLet's list them to verify:\n\nSuppose the people are A, B, C, D.\n\nPossible committees:\n\n1. A and B\n\n2. A and C\n\n3. A and D\n\n4. B and C\n\n5. B and D\n\n6. C and D\n\nIndeed, there are 6 possible committees, which matches our calculation.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, with 10 people choosing 4, we have 210 possible committees.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 210.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]"
