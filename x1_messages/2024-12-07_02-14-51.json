        "content": "So I've got this problem here: solve the heat equation \\( u_t = \\alpha^2 u_{xx} \\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant. Okay, let's see. The heat equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how heat (or any diffusive process) evolves over time in space. Here, \\(u(x,t)\\) represents the temperature distribution along a one-dimensional rod at position \\(x\\) and time \\(t\\), and \\(\\alpha^2\\) is the thermal diffusivity, which is a material property indicating how quickly heat spreads through the material.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some general methods for solving PDEs, especially the heat equation. One common approach is separation of variables, which assumes that the solution can be written as a product of functions, each depending on only one variable. So, let's try that.\n\nAssume \\( u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) \\). Plugging this into the heat equation:\n\n\\( u_t = \\alpha^2 u_{xx} \\) becomes \\( X(x)T'(t) = \\alpha^2 X''(x)T(t) \\).\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\( \\alpha^2 X(x)T(t) \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{T'(t)}{\\alpha^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} \\).\n\nThis is interesting because the left side depends only on \\(t\\), and the right side depends only on \\(x\\). Since \\(x\\) and \\(t\\) are independent variables, the only way for this equation to hold for all \\(x\\) and \\(t\\) is if both sides are equal to a constant. Let's call this constant \\( -\\lambda \\).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\( \\frac{T'(t)}{\\alpha^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda \\).\n\nThis gives us two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1. \\( X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0 \\) (the spatial ODE),\n\n2. \\( T'(t) + \\alpha^2 \\lambda T(t) = 0 \\) (the temporal ODE).\n\nNow, I need to solve these ODEs separately.\n\nFirst, let's solve the spatial ODE: \\( X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0 \\).\n\nThe general solution to this ODE depends on the value of \\(\\lambda\\):\n\n- If \\(\\lambda > 0\\), the solution is \\( X(x) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x) \\).\n\n- If \\(\\lambda = 0\\), the solution is \\( X(x) = A x + B \\).\n\n- If \\(\\lambda < 0\\), the solution is \\( X(x) = A \\cosh(\\sqrt{-\\lambda} x) + B \\sinh(\\sqrt{-\\lambda} x) \\).\n\nNext, the temporal ODE: \\( T'(t) + \\alpha^2 \\lambda T(t) = 0 \\).\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\n\\( T(t) = C e^{-\\alpha^2 \\lambda t} \\).\n\nNow, to find the specific solution, I need to consider the boundary conditions and initial conditions of the problem. Since these weren't provided in the question, I'll assume some common boundary conditions for a rod of finite length \\(L\\), with both ends insulated or held at zero temperature, for example.\n\nLet's assume the rod is insulated at both ends, which translates to Neumann boundary conditions:\n\n\\( u_x(0,t) = 0 \\) and \\( u_x(L,t) = 0 \\) for all \\(t > 0\\).\n\nGiven \\( u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) \\), the boundary conditions become:\n\n\\( X'(0)T(t) = 0 \\) and \\( X'(L)T(t) = 0 \\) for all \\(t > 0\\).\n\nSince \\(T(t)\\) is not identically zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have \\( X'(0) = 0 \\) and \\( X'(L) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, the spatial ODE with these boundary conditions is:\n\n\\( X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0 \\), with \\( X'(0) = 0 \\) and \\( X'(L) = 0 \\).\n\nNow, let's solve this eigenvalue problem.\n\nCase 1: \\(\\lambda > 0\\).\n\nThe general solution is \\( X(x) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x) \\).\n\nApplying \\( X'(0) = 0 \\):\n\n\\( X'(x) = -A \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x) + B \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x) \\).\n\nSo, \\( X'(0) = B \\sqrt{\\lambda} = 0 \\). Since \\(\\lambda > 0\\), \\( B = 0 \\).\n\nThus, \\( X(x) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x) \\).\n\nNow, apply the second boundary condition \\( X'(L) = 0 \\):\n\n\\( X'(x) = -A \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} L) = 0 \\).\n\nAgain, since \\(A \\neq 0\\) (otherwise trivial solution), we have \\( \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} L) = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( \\sqrt{\\lambda} L = n \\pi \\) for \\( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\lambda_n = \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 \\), for \\( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots \\).\n\nCorresponding eigenfunctions are \\( X_n(x) = \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) \\).\n\nCase 2: \\(\\lambda = 0\\).\n\nThe general solution is \\( X(x) = A x + B \\).\n\nApplying \\( X'(0) = 0 \\):\n\n\\( X'(x) = A \\), so \\( A = 0 \\).\n\nThus, \\( X(x) = B \\), a constant.\n\nApplying \\( X'(L) = 0 \\):\n\n\\( X'(x) = 0 \\), which is already satisfied.\n\nSo, \\( \\lambda_0 = 0 \\) with eigenfunction \\( X_0(x) = 1 \\).\n\nCase 3: \\(\\lambda < 0\\).\n\nLet \\(\\lambda = -\\mu^2\\) for some \\(\\mu > 0\\).\n\nThe general solution is \\( X(x) = A \\cosh(\\mu x) + B \\sinh(\\mu x) \\).\n\nApplying \\( X'(0) = 0 \\):\n\n\\( X'(x) = A \\mu \\sinh(\\mu x) + B \\mu \\cosh(\\mu x) \\).\n\nSo, \\( X'(0) = B \\mu = 0 \\), implying \\( B = 0 \\).\n\nThus, \\( X(x) = A \\cosh(\\mu x) \\).\n\nApplying \\( X'(L) = 0 \\):\n\n\\( X'(x) = A \\mu \\sinh(\\mu L) = 0 \\).\n\nSince \\(A \\neq 0\\) and \\(\\mu > 0\\), \\( \\sinh(\\mu L) = 0 \\).\n\nBut \\(\\sinh\\) is only zero at zero, and \\(\\mu L > 0\\), so no solution in this case.\n\nTherefore, only \\(\\lambda \\geq 0\\) are acceptable, and the eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda_n = \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 \\) for \\( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots \\), with corresponding eigenfunctions \\( X_n(x) = \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) \\).\n\nNow, for each eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_n\\), the corresponding temporal solution is:\n\n\\( T_n(t) = C_n e^{-\\alpha^2 \\lambda_n t} = C_n e^{-\\alpha^2 \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 t} \\).\n\nTherefore, the general solution to the heat equation is a sum of these product solutions:\n\n\\( u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n e^{-\\alpha^2 \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 t} \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) \\).\n\nTo determine the coefficients \\( C_n \\), we need an initial condition, say \\( u(x,0) = f(x) \\), where \\( f(x) \\) is the initial temperature distribution along the rod.\n\nApplying the initial condition:\n\n\\( u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) = f(x) \\).\n\nThis is a Fourier cosine series, and the coefficients \\( C_n \\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\( C_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} f(x) \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) dx \\), for \\( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots \\).\n\nNote that for \\( n = 0 \\), the formula is slightly different:\n\n\\( C_0 = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} f(x) dx \\).\n\nSo, summarizing, the solution to the heat equation with insulated boundaries is:\n\n\\( u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n e^{-\\alpha^2 \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 t} \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) \\),\n\nwhere the coefficients \\( C_n \\) are given by:\n\n\\( C_n = \\begin{cases}\n\n\\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} f(x) dx & \\text{for } n = 0, \\\\\n\n\\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} f(x) \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) dx & \\text{for } n \\geq 1.\n\n\\end{cases} \\)\n\nThis is the solution for the heat equation with insulation at both ends. If different boundary conditions are applied, such as Dirichlet (prescribed temperature) or Robin (convective) conditions, the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues would change accordingly, leading to a different series solution.\n\nAlternatively, if the rod is of infinite length or has different boundary conditions, other methods such as integral transforms (e.g., Fourier transform) or similarity solutions might be more appropriate.\n\nIn summary, the heat equation can be solved using separation of variables, leading to an infinite series solution involving exponential decay terms and trigonometric spatial functions, with coefficients determined by the initial temperature distribution through Fourier series analysis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n e^{-\\alpha^2 \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 t} \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right)}"
