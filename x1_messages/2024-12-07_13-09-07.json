        "content": "Let's see here. The store sells apples for $1.50 per pound and oranges for $2.00 per pound. The customer is buying 4 pounds of apples and 6 pounds of oranges. I need to figure out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of the apples. Apples are $1.50 per pound, and the customer is buying 4 pounds. So, I multiply 1.50 by 4.\n\n1.50 \u00d7 4 = 6.00\n\nSo, the apples will cost $6.00.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost of the oranges. Oranges are $2.00 per pound, and the customer is buying 6 pounds. So, I multiply 2.00 by 6.\n\n2.00 \u00d7 6 = 12.00\n\nSo, the oranges will cost $12.00.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together.\n\n6.00 + 12.00 = 18.00\n\nTherefore, the customer will spend $18.00 in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total cost as the sum of the products of the price per pound and the number of pounds for each fruit.\n\nSo, for apples: 1.50 \u00d7 4 = 6.00\n\nFor oranges: 2.00 \u00d7 6 = 12.00\n\nAdding those up: 6.00 + 12.00 = 18.00\n\nYeah, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could think about the total weight and average price, but that might be more complicated for this scenario.\n\nOr, maybe I can consider the total cost as a combination of the two products.\n\nBut honestly, the straightforward approach seems correct here.\n\nSo, the customer will spend $18.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18.00} \\]"
