        "content": "So if a train is going at an average speed of 80 miles per hour and it takes 5 hours to get to where it's going, you want to know how far apart the starting point and the destination are, right?\n\nWell, to figure out distance when you have speed and time, you can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo in this case, it's:\n\nDistance = 80 miles/hour \u00d7 5 hours\n\nWhen you multiply those, the hours cancel out, and you're left with miles.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n80 \u00d7 5 = 400\n\nSo, the distance between the starting point and the destination is 400 miles.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it another way. If the train is going 80 miles every hour, and it goes for 5 hours, then in each hour it covers 80 miles.\n\nSo, in one hour: 80 miles\n\nTwo hours: 160 miles\n\nThree hours: 240 miles\n\nFour hours: 320 miles\n\nFive hours: 400 miles\n\nYeah, that matches what I got from the formula.\n\nAlternatively, if you ever forget the formula, you can think about it like this: speed is basically how much distance you cover in a certain amount of time. So, if you know the time, you can multiply it by the speed to find out the total distance covered.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, rearranging that, total distance equals average speed multiplied by total time.\n\nSo, again, Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this problem, Speed is 80 miles per hour, and Time is 5 hours.\n\nSo, Distance = 80 mph \u00d7 5 h = 400 miles\n\nIt's important to make sure that the units match. Here, speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, so everything works out nicely.\n\nIf the units didn't match, you might need to convert something. For example, if the speed was given in kilometers per hour and the time in minutes, you'd need to convert either the speed to kilometers per minute or the time to hours to make the units consistent.\n\nBut in this case, no need for that.\n\nSo, the answer is 400 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
