Then, someone gives you 3 apples. Now, the question is asking about grapes, which weren't mentioned before.\n\nSo, you have oranges and apples, but no grapes were given or taken away. Therefore, the number of grapes you have is zero, assuming you didn't have any to begin with.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the fruits are being combined or something. But really, since no grapes were involved in the transaction, you still have zero grapes.\n\nUnless, of course, there's more to the story. If there is, you should tell me, and I'll help you figure it out.\n\nBut based on what you've said, you have zero grapes."
