He was commissioned by Pope Julius II to repaint the ceiling, which was originally blue with golden stars. The project took place between 1508 and 1512, and the frescoes on the ceiling are some of the most renowned works of art in the world, featuring scenes from the Book of Genesis, including the famous depiction of the Creation of Adam, where God and Adam's fingers almost touch.\n"
