Many people mistakenly think it's Sydney or Melbourne, but Canberra was specifically chosen to be the capital because it's located roughly halfway between those two major cities. It's known for its beautiful lakeside setting and is home to many of Australia's government institutions and landmarks, such as Parliament House and Lake Burley Griffin."
