Below is a Python script that calculates the sum, average, and standard deviation of a list of numbers provided by the user.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_statistics(numbers):\n    n = len(numbers)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0, 0, 0\n    \n    total_sum = sum(numbers)\n    average = total_sum / n\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        standard_deviation = 0\n    else:\n        variance = sum((x - average) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (n - 1)\n        standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)\n    \n    return total_sum, average, standard_deviation\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by commas: \")\n    number_list = list(map(float, input_str.split(',')))\n    sum_result, avg, std_dev = calculate_statistics(number_list)\n    print(f\"Sum: {sum_result}\")\n    print(f\"Average: {avg}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function `calculate_statistics(numbers)`**:\n    - Calculates the sum of the numbers.\n    - Computes the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements.\n    - Calculates the standard deviation using the formula for sample standard deviation (since we use `n-1` in the denominator for variance).\n\n2. **Function `main()`**:\n    - Takes input from the user as a string of numbers separated by commas.\n    - Converts the input string into a list of floats.\n    - Calls `calculate_statistics` to get sum, average, and standard deviation.\n    - Prints the results.\n\n### Usage:\n- Run the script.\n- Enter a list of numbers separated by commas when prompted.\n- The script will display the sum, average, and standard deviation of the entered numbers."
