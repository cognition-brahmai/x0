        "content": "So, the problem is that a baker uses 5 eggs to make 10 cupcakes, and we need to find out how many eggs he'll use to make 60 cupcakes. Hmm, this seems like a straightforward proportion problem, right?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cupcakes. If 5 eggs make 10 cupcakes, then maybe I can find out how many eggs are needed for one cupcake and then scale it up to 60 cupcakes.\n\nSo, let's see: 5 eggs for 10 cupcakes means that for each cupcake, the baker uses 5/10 = 0.5 eggs. Wait, that can't be right because you can't really use half an egg in baking. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of ratios. The ratio of eggs to cupcakes is 5:10, which simplifies to 1:2. So, for every egg, the baker can make 2 cupcakes. If that's the case, then for 60 cupcakes, he would need 60 divided by 2, which is 30 eggs.\n\nLet me double-check that. If 1 egg makes 2 cupcakes, then 30 eggs should make 30 times 2, which is 60 cupcakes. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up a proportion. If 5 eggs correspond to 10 cupcakes, then x eggs correspond to 60 cupcakes. So, 5/10 = x/60. Solving for x, we get x = (5/10)*60 = 30 eggs.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I thought about eggs per cupcake, but that led to a decimal, which might not make sense in practical baking terms. Maybe it's better to stick with the ratio approach, where the ratio of eggs to cupcakes is 1:2, as I did earlier.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using multiples. If 10 cupcakes require 5 eggs, then to find out how many batches of 10 cupcakes are in 60 cupcakes, I can divide 60 by 10, which is 6. So, if one batch (10 cupcakes) needs 5 eggs, then 6 batches would need 6 times 5, which is 30 eggs.\n\nThat's consistent with the previous methods. So, no matter which way I look at it, the answer seems to be 30 eggs.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the number of eggs needed. For example, does baking a larger batch require adjustments in the recipe? Sometimes, when scaling up recipes, especially in baking, some ingredients might not scale linearly due to factors like oven temperature, mixing times, etc. However, in this problem, it doesn't specify any such complications, so I think it's safe to assume a linear relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cupcakes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 30 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
