        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a restaurant's seating capacity. Let's see what it's asking. There are 12 tables that seat 4 people each and 8 tables that seat 6 people each. I need to find out how many people are seated when the restaurant is at full capacity.\n\nOkay, first things first, I should probably calculate the total seating capacity for each type of table and then add them together to get the total number of people seated.\n\nSo, for the 12 tables that seat 4 people each, the total seating capacity would be 12 tables times 4 people per table. That should be 12 * 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8 tables that seat 6 people each, it's 8 tables times 6 people per table, which is 8 * 6.\n\nThen, I'll add those two results together to get the total number of people seated when the restaurant is full.\n\nLet me do the math step by step.\n\nFirst, 12 * 4:\n\n12 * 4 = 48.\n\nNext, 8 * 6:\n\n8 * 6 = 48.\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n48 + 48 = 96.\n\nSo, the restaurant can seat a total of 96 people when it's at full capacity.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n12 tables seating 4 people each: 12 * 4 = 48.\n\n8 tables seating 6 people each: 8 * 6 = 48.\n\nTotal: 48 + 48 = 96.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of total seating capacity.\n\nTotal seating capacity = (number of tables seating 4) * 4 + (number of tables seating 6) * 6.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (12 * 4) + (8 * 6) = 48 + 48 = 96.\n\nSame answer.\n\nMaybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nLet's consider the total number of tables: 12 + 8 = 20 tables.\n\nIf all tables were seating 4 people, the total capacity would be 20 * 4 = 80 people.\n\nBut some tables seat 6 people. Specifically, there are 8 tables that seat 6 instead of 4, so for each of those tables, there are 6 - 4 = 2 extra seats.\n\nSo, for 8 tables, that's 8 * 2 = 16 extra seats.\n\nAdding those to the initial 80 seats: 80 + 16 = 96 seats.\n\nAgain, the same total of 96 people.\n\nAlternatively, if all tables were seating 6 people, the total capacity would be 20 * 6 = 120 people.\n\nBut some tables seat only 4 people. Specifically, there are 12 tables seating 4 instead of 6, so for each of those tables, there are 6 - 4 = 2 fewer seats.\n\nSo, for 12 tables, that's 12 * 2 = 24 fewer seats.\n\nSubtracting those from the initial 120 seats: 120 - 24 = 96 seats.\n\nOnce more, confirming the total is 96 people.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. The answer should be 96 people seated when the restaurant is at full capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
