I'm starting to think that being Spider-Man comes with its own curriculum\u2014one that's way tougher than anything Mr. Harrington throws at us in physics class. Balancing school and superheroing is like trying to solve a complex equation where variables keep changing without notice. But hey, I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nThis morning started with a real curveball. I was supposed to have a big test in biology, but you know how it is when you're swinging between skyscrapers saving people from green monsters or stopping robbers with fancy gadgets. My spider-sense goes off, and before I know it, I'm out the window, webslinger extraordinaire. So, there I was, trying to memorize the differences between mitosis and meiosis while avoiding bullets and dodging debris from a collapsing building. Talk about multi-tasking!\n\nSchool has been a challenge lately. Teachers are starting to notice my absences and late assignments. I can almost hear Aunt May's disappointment, even though she doesn't know about my double life. I've been trying to explain that something came up, but I can't exactly say I was web-slinging through the city, can I? So, I've been pulling all-nighters to catch up, which isn't the healthiest habit, but hey, someone has to keep this city safe.\n\nSpeaking of which, I had an epic battle with the Green Goblin last night. That guy is relentless. He's always one step ahead, and his goblin glider is seriously high-tech. I managed to take him down, but not before he caused a lot of damage. The city was in shambles, but thanks to some quick thinking and a well-placed web, I managed to save a bunch of people from his exploding pumpkin bombs. It's moments like those that make me realize why I do this. Sure, it's tough, but seeing the look of relief on people's faces makes it all worth it.\n\nBut let's not forget about the personal stuff. Mary Jane has been asking a lot of questions lately. She's smart; she knows something's up. I can't keep lying to her, but I can't tell her the truth either. It's a no-win situation. I just hope she understands someday. And then there's Gwen; she's been supportive, but I can't help but feel like I'm keeping her at arm's length. Being in a relationship while being a superhero isn't easy. Trust me, I've tried.\n\nOn the bright side, I did manage to ace that biology test today. All that studying paid off, I guess. Plus, I turned in my English essay on time, which was a miracle considering everything that's been going on. Ms. Gonzales seemed impressed, which is a good sign. Maybe she'll give me some extra credit for all the real-life experience I've been having lately. Ha!\n\nOh, and I almost forgot\u2014the Flasher is back. Yeah, that speedster villain who thinks he's the next big thing. He's been causing trouble downtown, and I have a feeling he's planning something big. I need to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity. It's like having a part-time job where the stakes are way higher than just making a sale or balancing books.\n\nAll in all, it's been a crazy day. I'm exhausted, but in a good way. Knowing that I made a difference, even if it's just saving one person, makes all the tiredness fade away. I just hope that someday, I can find a better balance between being Peter Parker, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, and everything else that comes with it.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nSpider-Man\n\nP.S. Need to remember to do my algebra homework tonight. Can't have Ms. Lockhart on my case too.\n\n"
