Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a mixture of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine.  This tool is useful in finding an appropriate list of sites that may or may not include the answer to the user's question.  The function doesn't directly answer the question; it finds a list of sites that may have the answer.\nSiteLoader[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nURLGrabber[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nAIQA[input]: Artificial Intelligence Question Answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text.  The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function just just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g. AIQA[What is the capital of Michigan, given :evidence3:?]\n\nBe sure to only include one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was the director of the movie 'Inception' and what other movies has he directed?"
