        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a school, there are 4 times as many students as teachers. If there are 25 teachers, how many people are there in total? And I need to explain my logic.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, it says there are 4 times as many students as teachers. That means for every teacher, there are 4 students. So if there are 25 teachers, I can find the number of students by multiplying 25 by 4.\n\nLet me do that: 25 teachers * 4 students/teacher = 100 students.\n\nNow, to find the total number of people in the school, I need to add the number of teachers and the number of students together. So that's 25 teachers + 100 students = 125 people in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Is there perhaps any other staff members or administrators in the school that might be part of the total number of people? The problem only mentions teachers and students, so I think it's safe to assume that's all there is.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. 25 teachers times 4 students per teacher is indeed 100 students. Adding that to the number of teachers gives me 125. That seems straightforward.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the total number of people in the school is 125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
