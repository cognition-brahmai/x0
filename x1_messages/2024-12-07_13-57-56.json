        "content": "So I've got this problem about a library, and I need to figure out how many green books there are. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 16 rows of shelves. Each row has 6 shelves, and each shelf holds 10 books. So, to find the total number of books, I need to multiply these numbers together. Let's do that:\n\n16 rows \u00d7 6 shelves per row \u00d7 10 books per shelf.\n\nFirst, 16 \u00d7 6 is 96 shelves in total. Then, 96 shelves \u00d7 10 books per shelf is 960 books. So, there are 960 books in the library.\n\nNow, half of the books are red. So, half of 960 is 480 books that are red.\n\nNext, one quarter are blue. One quarter of 960 is 240 books that are blue.\n\nThe rest are green. So, to find the number of green books, I need to subtract the red and blue books from the total number of books.\n\nThat is, 960 - 480 (red) - 240 (blue) = 240 green books.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If half are red and one quarter are blue, that adds up to three-quarters of the books. So, the remaining quarter should be green.\n\nLet's see: three-quarters of 960 is 720 (since 480 + 240 = 720). Then, 960 - 720 = 240, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, there are 240 green books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
