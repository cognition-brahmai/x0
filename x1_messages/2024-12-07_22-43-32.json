        "content": "So, there's this store that's having a sale, and they're giving a 25% discount on all items. I have this shirt that I want to buy, and it originally costs $40. I need to find out how much it will cost after the discount. Can you help me with that?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 25% discount means. I know that percentages are parts of 100, so 25% means 25 per 100 or 25/100, which is the same as 0.25 in decimal form. So, the discount is 0.25 times the original price.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDiscount = 25% of original price\n\nOriginal price = $40\n\nSo, Discount = 0.25 \u00d7 40\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 40 = 10\n\nSo, the discount is $10.\n\nNow, to find the final price after the discount, I need to subtract the discount from the original price.\n\nFinal price = original price - discount\n\nFinal price = 40 - 10 = 30\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but I think I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the discount calculation again.\n\n25% of 40:\n\n25% = 25/100 = 0.25\n\n0.25 \u00d7 40 = 10\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, subtracting the discount from the original price:\n\n40 - 10 = 30\n\nSo, the final price should be $30.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to calculate this.\n\nI've heard of a method where you calculate what percentage of the original price you actually have to pay after the discount.\n\nFor example, if there's a 25% discount, that means you're paying 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.\n\nSo, another way to calculate the final price is:\n\nFinal price = 75% of original price\n\n75% = 75/100 = 0.75\n\nSo, Final price = 0.75 \u00d7 40\n\nLet's do the multiplication:\n\n0.75 \u00d7 40 = 30\n\nAgain, I get $30.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to make sure I understand this completely, let's consider another example.\n\nSuppose there's a 20% discount on a $50 item.\n\nUsing the first method:\n\nDiscount = 20% of 50 = 0.20 \u00d7 50 = 10\n\nFinal price = 50 - 10 = 40\n\nUsing the second method:\n\nFinal price = 80% of 50 = 0.80 \u00d7 50 = 40\n\nAgain, both methods give the same result.\n\nSo, I can be confident that the final price of the shirt after a 25% discount is $30.\n\nBut, maybe there are some scenarios where this might not apply, like stacked discounts or taxes.\n\nWait, in this particular problem, it's just a single discount with no mention of taxes or additional discounts.\n\nSo, I don't need to worry about those complications right now.\n\nBut for completeness, if there were taxes, I would need to apply the tax rate to the discounted price.\n\nFor example, if there's a 10% sales tax on the discounted price.\n\nFirst, apply the discount:\n\nDiscounted price = original price - discount\n\nThen, apply the tax:\n\nFinal price with tax = discounted price + (tax rate \u00d7 discounted price)\n\nOr, equivalently:\n\nFinal price with tax = discounted price \u00d7 (1 + tax rate)\n\nBut again, in this problem, there's no mention of taxes, so I can ignore that.\n\nAlso, sometimes stores have multiple discounts, like an additional discount on already discounted items.\n\nBut in this case, it's a single 25% discount on all items.\n\nSo, I think I've covered all the bases here.\n\nTo sum it up, the shirt originally costs $40, and with a 25% discount, the final price will be $30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
