        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of pens: blue pens that cost $1.50 each and red pens that cost $2.00 each. The customer buys a total of 15 pens and spends exactly $25. We need to find out how many of each type of pen they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define variables for the number of blue pens and the number of red pens. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of blue pens.\n\n- Let \\( r \\) be the number of red pens.\n\nWe know that the total number of pens is 15, so we can write the first equation as:\n\n\\[ b + r = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we know the cost of each type of pen and the total amount spent, which is $25. So, the total cost can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 1.50b + 2.00r = 25 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( b + r = 15 \\)\n\n2. \\( 1.50b + 2.00r = 25 \\)\n\nI think the best way to solve this is to use the substitution or elimination method. Maybe I'll try the substitution method first.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( b + r = 15 \\), I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let\u2019s solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 15 - r \\]\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for \\( b \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 1.50(15 - r) + 2.00r = 25 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify that:\n\nFirst, multiply 1.50 by 15:\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 15 = 22.50 \\]\n\nThen, multiply 1.50 by \\( -r \\):\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times (-r) = -1.50r \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 22.50 - 1.50r + 2.00r = 25 \\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[ 22.50 + ( -1.50r + 2.00r ) = 25 \\]\n\n\\[ 22.50 + 0.50r = 25 \\]\n\nNext, subtract 22.50 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.50r = 2.50 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.50 to solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{2.50}{0.50} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the number of red pens is 5.\n\nNow, substitute back into the first equation to find \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 15 - r = 15 - 5 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 10 blue pens and 5 red pens.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. The cost of 10 blue pens at $1.50 each would be:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 1.50 = 15.00 \\]\n\nThe cost of 5 red pens at $2.00 each would be:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 2.00 = 10.00 \\]\n\nAdding those up:\n\n\\[ 15.00 + 10.00 = 25.00 \\]\n\nThat matches the total amount spent. Also, 10 blue pens plus 5 red pens equal 15 pens, which matches the total number of pens bought. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the elimination method to solve the system of equations. Let\u2019s try that to verify.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( b + r = 15 \\)\n\n2. \\( 1.50b + 2.00r = 25 \\)\n\nTo eliminate one of the variables, I can manipulate the equations so that when I add or subtract them, one variable cancels out.\n\nLet\u2019s try to eliminate \\( b \\). To do that, I can multiply the first equation by -1.50:\n\n\\[ -1.50b - 1.50r = -22.50 \\]\n\nNow, I have:\n\n\\[ -1.50b - 1.50r = -22.50 \\]\n\nAnd the second equation is:\n\n\\[ 1.50b + 2.00r = 25.00 \\]\n\nNow, add these two equations together:\n\n\\[ (-1.50b + 1.50b) + (-1.50r + 2.00r) = -22.50 + 25.00 \\]\n\n\\[ 0b + 0.50r = 2.50 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 0.50r = 2.50 \\), which means \\( r = 5 \\), just like before.\n\nThen, substitute back into the first equation:\n\n\\[ b + 5 = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 10 \\]\n\nAgain, we get the same answer: 10 blue pens and 5 red pens.\n\nI think that\u2019s pretty straightforward. It\u2019s always good to check your work with a different method to ensure accuracy.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think about the average cost per pen. The total cost is $25 for 15 pens, so the average cost per pen is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{25}{15} \\approx 1.6667 \\] dollars per pen.\n\nSince blue pens cost $1.50 and red pens cost $2.00, the average cost suggests that the customer bought more blue pens than red pens, which aligns with our solution of 10 blue pens and 5 red pens.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the difference in price, each red pen costs $0.50 more than a blue pen. The total extra amount spent due to choosing red pens instead of blue pens is:\n\n\\[ 25 - (15 \\times 1.50) = 25 - 22.5 = 2.5 \\] dollars.\n\nSince each red pen adds an extra $0.50, the number of red pens is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2.5}{0.5} = 5 \\]\n\nAgain, this confirms that there are 5 red pens and, consequently, 10 blue pens.\n\nI think these multiple methods all lead to the same conclusion, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s consider if there could be other solutions. For example, could the customer have bought a different combination of pens that still adds up to 15 pens and $25?\n\nSuppose they bought 9 blue pens and 6 red pens:\n\nCost would be:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 1.50 = 13.50 \\]\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 2.00 = 12.00 \\]\n\n\\[ 13.50 + 12.00 = 25.50 \\]\n\nThat\u2019s $25.50, which is over $25.\n\nOr, 11 blue pens and 4 red pens:\n\n\\[ 11 \\times 1.50 = 16.50 \\]\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 2.00 = 8.00 \\]\n\n\\[ 16.50 + 8.00 = 24.50 \\]\n\nThat\u2019s $24.50, which is under $25.\n\nSo, only 10 blue pens and 5 red pens give exactly $25.\n\nAnother angle to consider is if the customer bought negative pens or fractional pens, but that doesn\u2019t make sense in this context, as you can\u2019t buy negative or partial pens. So, the only feasible solution is 10 blue pens and 5 red pens.\n\nI should also consider if there are any constraints I missed. For example, the store might have a limited number of each type of pen, but since no such constraints are mentioned, we can assume that there are enough pens of each type available.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there is a tax or discount applied, but again, the problem states that the total spent is exactly $25, so we can take that as the final amount.\n\nIn conclusion, the customer bought 10 blue pens and 5 red pens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ blue pens and } 5 \\text{ red pens}} \\]"
