Many models also feature breathable uppers to keep feet cool during exercise.\n\n2. **Sneakers**:\n   - **Main Features**: Versatile shoes often worn for casual wear or athletic activities. They usually have a rubber sole for traction and durability, and a canvas or leather upper for durability and style.
