        "content": "So the factory produces widgets in batches of 100, and in each batch, 10% are defective. It's making 5 batches, and I need to find out how many non-defective widgets that will be in total.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many defective widgets are in one batch. If each batch has 100 widgets and 10% are defective, then the number of defective widgets per batch is 10% of 100, which is 10 widgets.\n\nSo, in one batch, there are 10 defective widgets. That means the number of non-defective widgets in one batch is 100 minus 10, which is 90 widgets.\n\nNow, since the factory is producing 5 batches, I can multiply the number of non-defective widgets in one batch by 5 to get the total number of non-defective widgets.\n\nSo, 90 non-defective widgets per batch times 5 batches equals 450 non-defective widgets.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by calculating the total number of widgets first and then finding out how many are non-defective.\n\nLet's try that. If each batch has 100 widgets and there are 5 batches, then the total number of widgets produced is 100 times 5, which is 500 widgets.\n\nNow, if 10% of all these widgets are defective, then the number of defective widgets is 10% of 500, which is 50 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-defective widgets would be the total widgets minus the defective ones, which is 500 minus 50, equaling 450 non-defective widgets.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should check if the percentage applies uniformly across all batches.\n\nGiven that each batch independently has 10% defective widgets, and assuming that the defectiveness is random and not correlated between batches, then my calculations should hold.\n\nI don't think I need to consider any other factors here, unless there's something about the way batches are produced that could affect the defect rate, but based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 450 non-defective widgets in 5 batches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]"
