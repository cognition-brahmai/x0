The games you've listed\u2014Chess, Monopoly, Scrabble, Clue, Risk, Candy Land, and Trivial Pursuit\u2014each belong to different categories based on their primary mechanics. Let's\u5206\u7c7b these games and explore the history behind each category.\n\n### 1. **Strategy Games**\n\n**Games: Chess, Risk**\n\n**Description:** Strategy games require players to use planning, foresight, and decision-making skills to outmaneuver their opponents. These games often involve complex rules and deep strategic thinking.\n\n**History:**\n\n- **Chess:** Originating in northern India in the 6th century AD as a game called chatura\u1e45ga, chess spread to Persia and then to the Arab world, where it was known as shatranj. It evolved over centuries, reaching its current form in the 15th century in Europe. Chess is renowned for its intellectual challenge and has a rich history in literature, art, and culture.\n\n- **Risk:** Created by French film director Albert Lamorisse and first published in 1957, Risk is a game of territorial conquest. Players aim to conquer the world by strategically placing armies and engaging in battles across a map divided into territories. Risk popularized the area control mechanism in board games and has been influential in the development of strategic board games.\n\n### 2. **Luck-Based Games**\n\n**Games: Candy Land**\n\n**Description:** Luck-based games rely heavily on random elements such as dice rolls or card draws, with minimal strategic decision-making. These games are often simple and designed for younger players.\n\n**History:**\n\n- **Candy Land:** Invented by Eleanor Abbott in 1949 while she was recovering from polio at a San Diego hospital, Candy Land was designed to amuse children who were bedridden. The game's simplicity and bright, colorful theme have made it a classic for young children, focusing on basic counting and color recognition rather than strategy.\n\n### 3. **Property Trading Games**\n\n**Games: Monopoly**\n\n**Description:** Property trading games involve buying, selling, and developing properties to earn rent from opponents, with the goal of driving them into bankruptcy.\n\n**History:**\n\n- **Monopoly:** Although often attributed to Charles Darrow, Monopoly has a complex history with roots in earlier games like The Landlord's Game, created by Elizabeth Magie in 1903 to demonstrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. The modern version was developed in the United States during the Great Depression and was published by Parker Brothers in 1935. Monopoly has become one of the best-selling board games worldwide, known for its themes of capitalism and real estate.\n\n### 4. **Word Games**\n\n**Games: Scrabble**\n\n**Description:** Word games require players to form words from letters, often scoring points based on letter values and word lengths. These games test vocabulary, spelling, and language skills.\n\n**History:**\n\n- **Scrabble:** Invented by Alfred Mosher Butts during the Great Depression, Scrabble was initially called \"Criss Cross Words.\" It gained popularity in the 1950s after being purchased by James Brunot, who simplified the rules and began mass production. Scrabble has since become a cultural icon, with millions of sets sold worldwide and regular tournaments held for serious players.\n\n### 5. **Detective/Puzzle Games**\n\n**Games: Clue**\n\n**Description:** Detective or puzzle games involve solving a mystery or figuring out a secret through deduction and logic. Players often have to gather clues and eliminate possibilities to reach the correct solution.\n\n**History:**\n\n- **Clue:** Also known as \"Cluedo\" outside North America, Clue was invented by Anthony E. Pratt in England in 1947. The game is set in a mansion where players must deduce who committed a murder, with suspects, weapons, and rooms as variables. Clue popularized the detective game genre and has been a staple in many households for generations.\n\n### 6. **Trivia Games**\n\n**Games: Trivial Pursuit**\n\n**Description:** Trivia games test players' knowledge across various subjects through multiple-choice questions. Players collect points or move around a board based on their answers.\n\n**History:**\n\n- **Trivial Pursuit:** Created by Chris Haney and Scott Abbott in 1979, Trivial Pursuit is a board game that requires players to answer questions from six categories: History, Science & Nature, Geography, Arts, Literature & Music, and Entertainment. The game was initially produced in a garage and became a massive success, spawning numerous editions and adaptations. Trivial Pursuit has been influential in the trivia game category, encouraging players to broaden their general knowledge.\n\nEach of these categories represents a different aspect of gameplay, catering to various player preferences and skill sets. From the strategic depth of Chess and Risk to the luck-based simplicity of Candy Land, and from the property trading of Monopoly to the word play of Scrabble, these games offer a rich tapestry of experiences that have entertained and challenged players for generations.\n\n### References\n\n- Bell, R.
