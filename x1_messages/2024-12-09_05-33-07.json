        "content": "So, there are 7 billion people in the world, and each person has an average of 2 eyes. To find out how many eyes there are in total, I need to multiply the number of people by the average number of eyes per person.\n\nSo, that would be 7 billion times 2.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what 7 billion is. Billion can sometimes be confusing because different countries use different definitions. In the United States, a billion is 1,000 million, which is 10^9. So, 7 billion is 7 times 10^9, or 7,000,000,000.\n\nNow, multiplying that by 2:\n\n7,000,000,000 times 2.\n\nWell, multiplying by 2 is straightforward. Double the number.\n\nSo, 7 times 2 is 14.\n\nThen, we have the 9 zeros from the billion.\n\nSo, 14 followed by 9 zeros: 14,000,000,000.\n\nSo, there are 14 billion eyes in total.\n\nBut wait a minute, is the average really 2 eyes per person? I mean, most people have 2 eyes, but there might be some individuals who have fewer due to accidents, medical conditions, etc. So, is the average exactly 2?\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the average is slightly less than 2.\n\nBut for the sake of this question, it's assuming that the average is 2 eyes per person.\n\nSo, based on that assumption, the total number of eyes would be 14 billion.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be more precise, we might need to consider that the average is not exactly 2.\n\nBut according to the question, we're to assume that it's 2.\n\nSo, 7 billion people times 2 eyes per person equals 14 billion eyes.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14 \\text{ billion}} \\]"
