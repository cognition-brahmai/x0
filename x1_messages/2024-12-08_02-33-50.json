However, I must inform you that Langston Hughes was a prominent figure in the Harlem Renaissance, known for his poetry that often addressed the experiences of African Americans. His style is characterized by its simplicity, musical quality, and themes of racial identity and social justice. While birds are a common subject in poetry, incorporating them into a limerick in the style of Langston Hughes might be a bit challenging due to the constraints of the limerick form and Hughes' distinctive voice. But I'll do my best to craft something that captures both elements.\n\nHere's an attempt at a limerick about birds in the style of Langston Hughes:\n\nThere once was a bird on a wire,\n\nSinging a song, oh so sly,\n\nWith feathers so bright,\n\nIn the morning light,\n\nHe sang of freedom, up high.\n\nPlease note that this is a creative interpretation, and Langston Hughes' actual style may vary. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
