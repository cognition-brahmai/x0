        "content": "Let's break this down. The factory produces 100 widgets per hour, but every 4 hours, it stops for 1 hour for maintenance. It operates for a total of 24 hours. I need to find out how many widgets are produced in those 24 hours.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how the 24-hour period is divided into production and maintenance hours.\n\nSince it produces for 4 hours and then stops for 1 hour, that's a cycle of 5 hours.\n\nSo, in 5 hours, it produces for 4 hours and stops for 1 hour.\n\nNow, in 24 hours, how many such 5-hour cycles are there?\n\n24 divided by 5 is 4.8, which means there are 4 full cycles and some remainder.\n\nEach full cycle is 5 hours: 4 hours of production and 1 hour of maintenance.\n\nSo, in 4 full cycles, that's 4 times 5 hours, which is 20 hours.\n\nOut of these 20 hours, production is 4 hours per cycle, so 4 times 4 is 16 hours of production.\n\nIn those 16 hours, at 100 widgets per hour, that's 1600 widgets.\n\nNow, there are 24 - 20 = 4 hours left.\n\nIn these remaining 4 hours, the factory would be in its next cycle.\n\nSince the cycle is 4 hours production followed by 1 hour maintenance, in the remaining 4 hours, it would be producing for all 4 hours before it would need to stop for maintenance.\n\nBut since the total operation time is 24 hours, and it only has 4 hours left after the 4 full cycles, it would produce for those 4 hours without stopping for maintenance, because the next maintenance stop would be after those 4 hours, but the factory operation ends at 24 hours.\n\nSo, in these remaining 4 hours, it produces 4 times 100 widgets, which is 400 widgets.\n\nTherefore, total production is 1600 widgets from the full cycles plus 400 widgets from the remaining hours, totaling 2000 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that.\n\nIn the 4 full cycles, 16 hours of production, 1600 widgets.\n\nPlus the last 4 hours of production, 400 widgets.\n\nYes, that adds up to 2000 widgets.\n\nBut let me think again: is there any maintenance happening in those last 4 hours?\n\nNo, because the maintenance is after every 4 hours of production, but the factory stops operating after those 4 hours, so no maintenance is performed in those last 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total production is indeed 2000 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2000} \\]"
