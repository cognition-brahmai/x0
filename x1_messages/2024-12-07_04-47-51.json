They have narrowed down their choices to two different machines: Machine A costs $300,000 with an annual maintenance fee of $15,000, while Machine B costs $250,000 with an annual maintenance fee of $25,000. Both machines have a lifespan of 10 years. Determine which machine would be more cost-effective over its entire lifespan and explain your reasoning."

        "content": "To determine which machine is more cost-effective over its entire lifespan, we need to calculate the total cost for each machine over the 10-year period and then compare them.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for Machine A:\n\n1. **Initial cost:** $300,000\n\n2. **Annual maintenance fee:** $15,000 per year\n\n3. **Lifespan:** 10 years\n\nTotal maintenance cost over 10 years for Machine A:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total maintenance} = \\$15,000 \\times 10 = \\$150,000 \\]\n\nTotal cost for Machine A over 10 years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\$300,000 + \\$150,000 = \\$450,000 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for Machine B:\n\n1. **Initial cost:** $250,000\n\n2. **Annual maintenance fee:** $25,000 per year\n\n3. **Lifespan:** 10 years\n\nTotal maintenance cost over 10 years for Machine B:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total maintenance} = \\$25,000 \\times 10 = \\$250,000 \\]\n\nTotal cost for Machine B over 10 years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\$250,000 + \\$250,000 = \\$500,000 \\]\n\nComparing the total costs:\n\n- Machine A: \\$450,000\n\n- Machine B: \\$500,000\n\nMachine A is more cost-effective over its entire lifespan since its total cost (\\$450,000) is lower than that of Machine B (\\$500,000).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nAlthough Machine A has a higher initial cost, its lower annual maintenance fees result in a lower total cost over the 10-year period compared to Machine B, which has a lower initial cost but higher annual maintenance fees. Therefore, Machine A is the more cost-effective choice."
