Each tool will produce an evidence value that can be used in subsequent steps of the plan.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\nWebSearch[input]: This tool allows you to perform a web search for any given input string. It returns a list of sites that may contain relevant information.\nReadPage[input]: This tool reads and extracts text from a specific webpage URL. The output is plain text containing the content of the page.\nAskAI[input]: This tool answers questions based on common sense, general world knowledge, or given context. It requires a question as input and can use previous evidence values for context.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text response of newline-delimited links.\n\nEach step of the plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action]\n#E1 = [function with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action]\n#E2 = [next function with input parameter, possibly referencing #E1]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the history behind the creation of Bitcoin and who was involved?"
