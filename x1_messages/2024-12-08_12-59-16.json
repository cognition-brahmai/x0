        "content": "So I have this problem here: if it takes 6 workers to build a house in 12 days, how long would it take for 3 workers to build the same house? Hmm, this seems like a problem about work rates and how they relate to the time taken to complete a task.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken. Intuitively, if you have fewer workers, it should take longer to build the house, and vice versa. So, there's an inverse relationship between the number of workers and the time taken.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. If 6 workers take 12 days, then the total amount of work done is like 6 workers times 12 days, which is 72 worker-days. This is a way to measure the total effort required to build the house.\n\nNow, if I have 3 workers, I need to find out how many days it will take for them to complete the same amount of work, which is 72 worker-days. So, if I let the number of days be d, then 3 workers times d days should equal 72 worker-days.\n\nSo, 3 * d = 72.\n\nTo find d, I can divide both sides by 3:\n\nd = 72 / 3\n\nd = 24 days.\n\nSo, it would take 3 workers 24 days to build the same house.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If 6 workers take 12 days, and 3 is half of 6, then it should take twice as long for half the number of workers, right? Because fewer workers are doing the work, so it should take more time.\n\nYes, half the workers should take twice the time. So, 12 days multiplied by 2 is 24 days. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the work rate of each worker. If one worker works at a certain rate, say r houses per day, then 6 workers would work at a rate of 6r. If they build one house in 12 days, then:\n\n6r * 12 = 1 house\n\nSo, 72r = 1\n\nTherefore, r = 1/72 houses per day.\n\nNow, if there are 3 workers, their combined rate is 3r, which is 3*(1/72) = 1/24 houses per day.\n\nTo build one house, the time taken t would be:\n\nt = 1 house / (1/24 houses per day) = 24 days.\n\nAgain, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nLet me consider another approach to ensure I'm not missing anything. If 6 workers take 12 days, then the total work is 72 worker-days, as I calculated before. If I have 3 workers, then the time t required would be:\n\nt = total work / number of workers = 72 worker-days / 3 workers = 24 days.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nWhat if I think about it in terms of proportionality? Since the number of workers and the time taken are inversely proportional, I can set up a proportion:\n\nNumber of workers1 * Time1 = Number of workers2 * Time2\n\nSo, 6 * 12 = 3 * Time2\n\n72 = 3 * Time2\n\nTime2 = 72 / 3 = 24 days.\n\nOnce more, the same answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe considering the work done per day by the workers.\n\nIf 6 workers take 12 days, then each day they complete 1/12 of the house. So, the work rate of 6 workers is 1/12 of the house per day.\n\nTherefore, the work rate of one worker is (1/12)/6 = 1/72 of the house per day.\n\nSo, 3 workers would have a combined work rate of 3*(1/72) = 1/24 of the house per day.\n\nTherefore, to complete one house, it would take 24 days.\n\n\u53c8\u56de\u5230\u4e8624\u5929\u3002\n\n\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u540c\u6837\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5e94\u8be5\u6ca1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
