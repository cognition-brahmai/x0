It's important to use such characters responsibly and consider the impact of their portrayal.\n\nMoreover, creating content that involves fictional characters in scenarios that don't align with their established personalities or backstories can be misleading and may not serve a positive purpose.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask."
