        "content": "Let's see. The city has an average daily water consumption of 150 gallons per person, and there are 100,000 people living there. I need to find out how much water is consumed in one week.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total daily water consumption for the entire city. Since each person uses 150 gallons per day, I can multiply that by the number of people:\n\n150 gallons/person/day \u00d7 100,000 people = 15,000,000 gallons/day\n\nSo, the city consumes 15 million gallons of water each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly consumption, I need to multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:\n\n15,000,000 gallons/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 105,000,000 gallons/week\n\nTherefore, the city consumes 105 million gallons of water in one week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to think about it. Let's consider the total population first.\n\nTotal population = 100,000 people\n\nAverage daily consumption per person = 150 gallons\n\nSo, total daily consumption = 150 gallons/person \u00d7 100,000 people = 15,000,000 gallons\n\nNow, for one week:\n\n15,000,000 gallons/day \u00d7 7 days = 105,000,000 gallons\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of per capita consumption over a week. Each person uses 150 gallons/day, so in a week, one person uses:\n\n150 gallons/day \u00d7 7 days = 1,050 gallons/week\n\nThen, for 100,000 people:\n\n1,050 gallons/person/week \u00d7 100,000 people = 105,000,000 gallons/week\n\nAgain, the same result. So, I'm confident that 105 million gallons is the correct weekly water consumption for the city.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, is there any seasonal variation in water consumption? Are there any industrial or commercial uses of water that are not accounted for in the per person average? But based on the information provided, the average daily consumption is given as 150 gallons per person, and the population is 100,000, so multiplying those and then by 7 for the days in a week seems straightforward and appropriate.\n\nI should also consider units. The consumption is in gallons, and the time is in days and weeks. Make sure that all units are consistent, which they are in this case.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the week is a standard 7-day week. In some contexts, a work week might be different, but in this case, it's probably safe to assume a 7-day week.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the city consumes 105,000,000 gallons of water in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105000000} \\]"
