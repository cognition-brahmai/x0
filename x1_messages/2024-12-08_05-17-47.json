        "content": "Let's see. I have a jar with marbles of different colors: 10 red, 20 blue, and 30 green. So, the total number of marbles is 10 + 20 + 30, which equals 60 marbles.\n\nI need to find the probability of first picking a red marble and then, without putting it back, picking a blue marble.\n\nAlright, probability of two events happening in sequence without replacement. I remember that in such cases, the probability is the product of the probability of the first event and the probability of the second event given that the first has occurred.\n\nSo, first, what's the probability of picking a red marble initially?\n\nNumber of red marbles is 10, total marbles is 60. So, probability of picking a red marble first is 10/60, which simplifies to 1/6.\n\nNow, since we're not replacing the first marble, the total number of marbles left after the first pick is 59.\n\nAfter picking a red marble, the number of blue marbles remains 20, because we only picked a red one.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a blue marble second, given that the first was red, is 20/59.\n\nNow, to find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence, I need to multiply these two probabilities together.\n\nSo, probability of first event (picking red) is 1/6, and probability of second event (picking blue after red) is 20/59.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability is (1/6) * (20/59).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, multiply the numerators: 1 * 20 = 20.\n\nThen, multiply the denominators: 6 * 59 = 354.\n\nSo, the probability is 20/354.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2.\n\n20 \u00f7 2 = 10.\n\n354 \u00f7 2 = 177.\n\nSo, 10/177.\n\nI don't think that can be simplified further.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red marble followed by a blue marble without replacement is 10/177.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nTotal marbles: 60.\n\nPick one red: 10 options.\n\nThen, total marbles left: 59.\n\nPick one blue: 20 options.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 10 (for red) times 20 (for blue) equals 200.\n\nTotal possible outcomes for picking two marbles in sequence without replacement is 60 (first pick) times 59 (second pick) equals 3540.\n\nSo, probability is favorable outcomes over total outcomes: 200/3540.\n\nSimplify that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 20.\n\n200 \u00f7 20 = 10.\n\n3540 \u00f7 20 = 177.\n\nAgain, 10/177.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 10/177.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal to get a sense of it.\n\n10 divided by 177 is approximately 0.0565.\n\nTo express it as a percentage, multiply by 100: about 5.65%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 5.65% chance of picking a red marble followed by a blue marble without replacement.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to use combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to pick a red marble first and then a blue marble without replacement.\n\nNumber of ways to pick first red and then blue is C(10,1) * C(20,1) = 10 * 20 = 200.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick any two marbles in sequence without replacement is C(60,1) * C(59,1) = 60 * 59 = 3540.\n\nSo, probability is again 200/3540 = 10/177.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the combination without regard to order, but since the order matters here (first red, then blue), I think the approach I used is correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 10/177 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{10}{177}} \\]"
