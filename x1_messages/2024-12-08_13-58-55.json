        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The man has a daily commute to work that involves three different modes of transportation: walking, taking a bus, and riding a bike. Each segment of his journey has a specific duration: 20 minutes walking, 15 minutes on the bus, and 10 minutes biking. He starts his journey at 8:00 AM. We need to find out what time he arrives at work.\n\nFirst, we'll add up all the time he spends commuting. Let's list out each part:\n\n1. Walking: 20 minutes\n\n2. Bus ride: 15 minutes\n\n3. Biking: 10 minutes\n\nTotal commuting time = 20 + 15 + 10 = 45 minutes.\n\nNow, if he leaves his house at 8:00 AM and his total commuting time is 45 minutes, we can simply add 45 minutes to his departure time to find his arrival time.\n\n8:00 AM + 45 minutes = 8:45 AM.\n\nSo, he should arrive at work at 8:45 AM.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure there's no mistake. Maybe there are some variables I'm missing, like waiting times for the bus or traffic affecting the bike ride, but according to the information provided, there are no such variables. The times given seem to be straightforward durations for each mode of transportation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the activities are sequential but with overlaps. For example, does he walk for 20 minutes, then immediately take the bus for 15 minutes, and then ride his bike for 10 minutes? Or is there any waiting time between modes? But again, based on the information given, it seems like these are consecutive activities with no breaks in between.\n\nAnother angle to consider: does the bus schedule affect the timing? For instance, if he needs to wait for the bus after walking, that could add additional time. However, the problem states that he walks for 20 minutes, then takes the bus for 15 minutes, and finally rides his bike for 10 minutes. It seems like the bus is available immediately after he finishes walking, so no waiting time is involved.\n\nAlso, we should consider if there's any transfer time between the bus and the bike. For example, does he need to unlock the bike or do something before starting his bike ride? But again, the problem doesn't mention any such activities, so we'll assume that the transition is immediate.\n\nLet's consider another approach. Maybe we can think of the entire journey as a sequence of timed activities:\n\n- From 8:00 AM, he starts walking and walks for 20 minutes, arriving at the bus stop at 8:20 AM.\n\n- At 8:20 AM, he boards the bus, which takes 15 minutes, so he gets off the bus at 8:35 AM.\n\n- Immediately at 8:35 AM, he starts riding his bike and rides for 10 minutes, arriving at work at 8:45 AM.\n\nThis step-by-step timing also leads us to the same conclusion: he arrives at work at 8:45 AM.\n\nI think this is the correct answer based on the information provided. Unless there are additional factors not mentioned in the problem, such as delays or breaks between modes of transportation, 8:45 AM is when he arrives at work.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8:45 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
