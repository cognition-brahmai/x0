        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 8 men and 6 women, and I need to form a committee of 5 people with at least 2 women. How many ways can this be done? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that \"at least 2 women\" means that the committee can have 2, 3, 4, or even 5 women. So, I need to consider all these possibilities.\n\nI recall that the way to calculate combinations is using the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for this problem, I need to calculate the number of ways to choose committees with 2 women and 3 men, 3 women and 2 men, 4 women and 1 man, and 5 women and 0 men. Then, I'll add all these up to get the total number of ways.\n\nLet's start with 2 women and 3 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 women out of 6: C(6, 2).\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 men out of 8: C(8, 3).\n\nSo, the total number of ways for this scenario is C(6, 2) * C(8, 3).\n\nSimilarly, for 3 women and 2 men:\n\nC(6, 3) * C(8, 2).\n\nFor 4 women and 1 man:\n\nC(6, 4) * C(8, 1).\n\nAnd for 5 women and 0 men:\n\nC(6, 5) * C(8, 0).\n\nNow, I need to calculate each of these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(6, 2):\n\n6! / (2!(6 - 2)!) = (720) / (2 * 24) = 720 / 48 = 15.\n\nC(8, 3):\n\n8! / (3!(8 - 3)!) = (40320) / (6 * 120) = 40320 / 720 = 56.\n\nSo, for 2 women and 3 men: 15 * 56 = 840 ways.\n\nNext, C(6, 3):\n\n6! / (3! * 3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20.\n\nC(8, 2):\n\n8! / (2! * 6!) = 40320 / (2 * 720) = 40320 / 1440 = 28.\n\nSo, for 3 women and 2 men: 20 * 28 = 560 ways.\n\nNow, C(6, 4):\n\n6! / (4! * 2!) = 720 / (24 * 2) = 720 / 48 = 15.\n\nC(8, 1):\n\n8! / (1! * 7!) = 40320 / (1 * 5040) = 40320 / 5040 = 8.\n\nSo, for 4 women and 1 man: 15 * 8 = 120 ways.\n\nFinally, C(6, 5):\n\n6! / (5! * 1!) = 720 / (120 * 1) = 720 / 120 = 6.\n\nC(8, 0):\n\n8! / (0! * 8!) = 40320 / (1 * 40320) = 1.\n\nSo, for 5 women and 0 men: 6 * 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNow, I'll add all these up: 840 + 560 + 120 + 6 = 1526 ways.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Is there a simpler way to think about this?\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of ways to choose any 5 people from the 14 without any restrictions, and then subtract the number of ways that have fewer than 2 women, i.e., committees with 0 or 1 woman.\n\nSo, total number of ways without restrictions: C(14, 5).\n\nNumber of ways with 0 women (all men): C(8, 5) * C(6, 0) = C(8, 5) * 1.\n\nNumber of ways with 1 woman: C(6, 1) * C(8, 4).\n\nSo, the number of ways with at least 2 women = C(14, 5) - [C(8, 5) + C(6, 1) * C(8, 4)].\n\nLet's calculate this and see if it matches my earlier result.\n\nFirst, C(14, 5):\n\n14! / (5! * 9!) = (14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (120) = 2002.\n\nC(8, 5):\n\n8! / (5! * 3!) = (40320) / (120 * 6) = 40320 / 720 = 56.\n\nC(6, 1):\n\n6.\n\nC(8, 4):\n\n8! / (4! * 4!) = 40320 / (24 * 24) = 40320 / 576 = 70.\n\nSo, C(6, 1) * C(8, 4) = 6 * 70 = 420.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways with fewer than 2 women is 56 + 420 = 476.\n\nThus, the number of ways with at least 2 women is 2002 - 476 = 1526.\n\nOkay, this matches my earlier calculation. So, 1526 ways is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I consider the minimum requirement of 2 women and calculate the combinations accordingly.\n\nI already did that in the first method, where I considered all possible scenarios from 2 to 5 women.\n\nAlternatively, I could use inclusion-exclusion principle, but I think the methods I've used are sufficient.\n\nI can also check if there's a formula for such cases, but I think the approach I took is standard for combination problems with restrictions.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 1526 ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1526} \\]"
