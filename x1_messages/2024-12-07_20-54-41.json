        "content": "So the hotel chain is planning to build a new resort with 150 rooms, each averaging 400 square feet. They also need to account for additional facilities like a restaurant, spa, gym, and conference rooms, which together will take up 30% of the total built-up area. On top of that, they want to estimate the number of staff members required to maintain a 1:10 staff-to-guest ratio during peak occupancy. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total built-up area required for the resort. The rooms themselves will occupy a certain amount of space, and then there's an additional 30% for the other facilities. So, I should probably find out the area for the rooms and then figure out what total area would make the additional facilities 30% of that total.\n\nLet me denote the total built-up area as T. The area for the rooms is 150 rooms times 400 square feet per room, which is 150 * 400 = 60,000 square feet. The additional facilities take up 30% of the total area, so that's 0.30 * T. Therefore, the area for the rooms plus the area for the facilities should equal the total area T.\n\nSo, 60,000 + 0.30T = T.\n\nNow, I can solve for T.\n\n60,000 = T - 0.30T\n\n60,000 = 0.70T\n\nT = 60,000 / 0.70\n\nT = 85,714.2857 square feet.\n\nSo, the total built-up area required is approximately 85,714 square feet.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the number of staff members needed to maintain a 1:10 staff-to-guest ratio during peak occupancy. To find this, I need to know the total number of guests during peak occupancy.\n\nAssuming that each room can hold a certain number of guests, I need to know the occupancy per room. However, the problem doesn't specify how many guests each room can hold. For simplicity, let's assume that each room holds two guests, which is common for hotels.\n\nSo, 150 rooms * 2 guests per room = 300 guests during peak occupancy.\n\nNow, with a 1:10 staff-to-guest ratio, that means for every 10 guests, there is one staff member.\n\nSo, number of staff = total guests / 10 = 300 / 10 = 30 staff members.\n\nHowever, this seems a bit low for a resort with all those facilities. Maybe the ratio is different or perhaps I need to consider the total area or something else. Wait, perhaps the ratio is 1 staff per 10 guests, meaning 1:10, which would be 30 staff for 300 guests. But intuitively, a resort with a restaurant, spa, gym, and conference rooms might require more staff than that. Maybe the ratio is different or perhaps I misinterpreted it.\n\nLet me double-check the ratio. The problem says \"a 1:10 staff-to-guest ratio during peak occupancy.\" That means for every 10 guests, there is 1 staff member. So, yes, 300 guests would require 30 staff members.\n\nBut perhaps the ratio includes both guests and staff, or maybe it's different. Wait, ratios can be interpreted in different ways. Sometimes, 1:10 can mean 1 staff for every 10 guests, which is what I did, or sometimes it might mean something else. I think in hotel operations, it's standard to have 1 staff per 10 guests, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio includes both guests and staff, making it 1 staff per 10 units of guests and staff combined. But that seems convoluted. I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, based on that, the resort would need approximately 30 staff members to maintain a 1:10 staff-to-guest ratio during peak occupancy.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider the size of the additional facilities. The total area is 85,714 square feet, with 60,000 square feet for rooms and 25,714 square feet for facilities. Maybe the number of staff depends on the total area or the size of the facilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the staff-to-guest ratio is not solely based on guests but also on the size of the resort or the number of facilities. However, based on the information provided, it seems that the ratio is strictly based on guests during peak occupancy.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation of 30 staff members seems accurate.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Total built-up area required: approximately 85,714 square feet.\n\n- Estimated number of staff members needed: 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{85714 \\text{ square feet},\\ 30\\text{ staff members}} \\]"
