For each step in your plan, generate an evidence value, which corresponds to the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools include:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Allows users to conduct an internet search via DuckDuckGo. Returns a list of potential websites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebReader[input]: Reads and extracts plain text from one or more websites when provided with a link(s).\nHyperlinkDetector[input]: Detects hyperlinks within plain text and outputs them as a newline-separated list.\nInfoBot[input]: An AI-powered question answering system that can provide answers based on a given context. The input must be a textual question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nEach function accepts a simple string as input, without quotation marks or \"+\" symbols to concatenate a string with an evidence variable (for example, InfoBot[Who won the World Series in 2020, given :evidence4:?]).\n\nThe output should follow this structure:\nPlan: [initial action]\n:evidence0: = [function name with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action, dependent on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [following function name and input parameter, potentially referring back to earlier evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: contains the ultimate response].\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the book \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other works have they written?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who wrote \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other books they've written. I think the best way to start is by searching the internet for information about the book and its author. I can use the DuckDuckGo tool for that.\n\nSo, first step:\n\nPlan: Conduct an internet search to find the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[author of To Kill a Mockingbird]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to look through the websites to find the name of the author. Probably, the first result will be from a reliable source like Wikipedia or Goodreads.\n\nNext step:\n\nPlan: Extract the relevant information from the search results.\n\nBut wait, DuckDuckGo will give me a list of websites, and I need to read those websites to find the author's name. So, I should use WebReader to extract the text from those websites.\n\nBut, I need to decide which websites to read. Maybe just the top few results from the search.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can have DuckDuckGo return a few top results, and then use WebReader on each of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just use InfoBot directly with the question, and see if it can answer it without going through all these steps.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoBot directly for the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\n:evidence1: = InfoBot[Who is the author of To Kill a Mockingbird?]\n\nNow, if InfoBot knows the answer, great! If not, I'll have to go back to the original plan and use DuckDuckGo and WebReader.\n\nAssuming InfoBot knows the author, which I think it should, since \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is a well-known book.\n\nSo, :evidence1: should give me the author's name, which is Harper Lee.\n\nNow, the next part is to find out what other works Harper Lee has written.\n\nAgain, I can ask InfoBot directly.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoBot for other works by Harper Lee.\n\n:evidence2: = InfoBot[What other books did Harper Lee write?]\n\nBut, I should consider that Harper Lee didn't write many books. I know she wrote \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and later \"Go Set a Watchman.\" Are there any other works?\n\nActually, \"Go Set a Watchman\" is a earlier draft that was published later. So, perhaps she hasn't written much else.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check.\n\nAlternatively, I can search for \"Harper Lee book list\" using DuckDuckGo.\n\nPlan: Conduct an internet search for Harper Lee's other works.\n\n:evidence3: = DuckDuckGo[Harper Lee book list]\n\nThen, use WebReader to extract information from the top results.\n\nPlan: Read the top website from the search results.\n\n:evidence4: = WebReader[:evidence3:]\n\nFinally, extract the list of books from the text.\n\nBut maybe this is overkill, as InfoBot might already know this information.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nPlan: Ask InfoBot for a list of books by Harper Lee.\n\n:evidence2: = InfoBot[What are all the books written by Harper Lee?]\n\nThen, the answer would be in :evidence2:.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the information is accurate. Maybe cross-referencing with a quick web search would be good.\n\nAlternatively, since Harper Lee is a well-known author, and her works are widely documented, relying on InfoBot should be sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan can be simplified:\n\n1. Ask InfoBot for the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\n2. Ask InfoBot for other books by that author.\n\n3. Provide both pieces of information in the final answer.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoBot for the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\n:evidence0: = InfoBot[Who is the author of To Kill a Mockingbird?]\n\nPlan: Ask InfoBot for other books written by the author found in :evidence0:.\n\n:evidence1: = InfoBot[What other books did :evidence0: write?]\n\nAnswer: The author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is :evidence0:, and their other works include :evidence1:.\n\nBut, to make it sound better, I can format it as a paragraph.\n\nAnswer: \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" was written by :evidence0:. In addition to this notable work, :evidence0: has also written :evidence1:.\"\n\nWait, but if :evidence1: is a list of books, I need to make sure it's presented nicely.\n\nAlternatively, I can have InfoBot provide a more detailed response in :evidence1:, including the names of the books and perhaps a brief description.\n\nBut, perhaps that's not necessary for this question.\n\nAlternatively, I can have InfoBot answer the entire question at once.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoBot the entire question.\n\n:evidence0: = InfoBot[Who is the author of the book \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other works have they written?]\n\nThen, the answer would be in :evidence0:.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nBut, to ensure accuracy, maybe I should cross-verify with a web search.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoBot for the author and other works.\n\n:evidence0: = InfoBot[Who is the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other books have they written?]\n\nPlan: Conduct a web search to verify the information.\n\n:evidence1: = DuckDuckGo[Harper Lee book list]\n\nPlan: Read the top result from the search.\n\n:evidence2: = WebReader[:evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Detect any hyperlinks in the text for further reference.\n\n:evidence3: = HyperlinkDetector[:evidence2:]\n\nBut, this might be unnecessary, as InfoBot should have accurate information.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm not sure about InfoBot's accuracy, I can compare its response with the web search results.\n\nBut, for the sake of time and efficiency, I'll proceed with InfoBot's response.\n\nSo, the final plan is:\n\nPlan: Ask InfoBot for the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and their other works.\n\n:evidence0: = InfoBot[Who is the author of the book \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other works have they written?]\n\nAnswer: :evidence0:\n\nThis should give me the required information in a straightforward manner.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ :evidence0: \\]"
