        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of friends going on a trip, and they're splitting the total cost evenly among themselves. The problem gives us two scenarios: one where there are 3 more friends, and each person pays $20 less, and another where there are 2 fewer friends, and each person pays $30 more. We need to find out how many friends are in the group originally.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say the original number of friends in the group is \\( n \\), and the total cost of the trip is \\( c \\) dollars.\n\nSince they're splitting the cost evenly, each person pays \\( \\frac{c}{n} \\) dollars.\n\nNow, in the first scenario, if there were 3 more friends, so the number of friends would be \\( n + 3 \\), and each person would pay \\( \\frac{c}{n + 3} \\) dollars, which is $20 less than what they would have paid originally. So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{c}{n + 3} = \\frac{c}{n} - 20 \\]\n\nSimilarly, in the second scenario, if there were 2 fewer friends, so the number of friends would be \\( n - 2 \\), and each person would pay \\( \\frac{c}{n - 2} \\) dollars, which is $30 more than what they would have paid originally. So, we can write another equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{c}{n - 2} = \\frac{c}{n} + 30 \\]\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables, \\( n \\) and \\( c \\). Our goal is to solve for \\( n \\), the number of friends.\n\nLet me write down these equations again for clarity:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{c}{n + 3} = \\frac{c}{n} - 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( \\frac{c}{n - 2} = \\frac{c}{n} + 30 \\)\n\nI need to solve these equations simultaneously to find \\( n \\). Maybe I can solve one equation for \\( c \\) and substitute into the other equation.\n\nLet's start with the first equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{c}{n + 3} = \\frac{c}{n} - 20 \\]\n\nI can multiply both sides by \\( n(n + 3) \\) to eliminate the denominators:\n\n\\[ c \\cdot n = c \\cdot (n + 3) - 20n(n + 3) \\]\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can isolate \\( c \\) in one of the equations and substitute it into the other.\n\nLet me try solving the first equation for \\( c \\).\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ \\frac{c}{n + 3} = \\frac{c}{n} - 20 \\]\n\nLet's get all terms involving \\( c \\) on one side:\n\n\\[ \\frac{c}{n + 3} - \\frac{c}{n} = -20 \\]\n\nFactor out \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ c \\left( \\frac{1}{n + 3} - \\frac{1}{n} \\right) = -20 \\]\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n\\[ c \\left( \\frac{n - (n + 3)}{n(n + 3)} \\right) = -20 \\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[ c \\left( \\frac{n - n - 3}{n(n + 3)} \\right) = -20 \\]\n\n\\[ c \\left( \\frac{-3}{n(n + 3)} \\right) = -20 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( \\frac{n(n + 3)}{-3} \\):\n\n\\[ c = -20 \\cdot \\frac{n(n + 3)}{-3} \\]\n\n\\[ c = 20 \\cdot \\frac{n(n + 3)}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{20n(n + 3)}{3} \\]\n\nAlright, now I have an expression for \\( c \\) in terms of \\( n \\). I can substitute this into the second equation.\n\nThe second equation is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{c}{n - 2} = \\frac{c}{n} + 30 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( c = \\frac{20n(n + 3)}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\frac{20n(n + 3)}{3}}{n - 2} = \\frac{\\frac{20n(n + 3)}{3}}{n} + 30 \\]\n\nThis looks a bit complicated, but let's simplify it step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify the left side:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20n(n + 3)}{3(n - 2)} \\]\n\nNow, simplify the right side:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20n(n + 3)}{3n} + 30 = \\frac{20(n + 3)}{3} + 30 \\]\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20n(n + 3)}{3(n - 2)} = \\frac{20(n + 3)}{3} + 30 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, maybe I can multiply both sides by \\( 3(n - 2) \\):\n\n\\[ 20n(n + 3) = 20(n + 3)(n - 2) + 30 \\cdot 3(n - 2) \\]\n\n\\[ 20n(n + 3) = 20(n + 3)(n - 2) + 90(n - 2) \\]\n\nNow, let's expand both sides.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n\\[ 20n^2 + 60n \\]\n\nNow, expand the right side:\n\nFirst, expand \\( (n + 3)(n - 2) \\):\n\n\\[ n^2 + n - 6 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 20(n^2 + n - 6) = 20n^2 + 20n - 120 \\)\n\nNow, add \\( 90(n - 2) \\):\n\n\\[ 20n^2 + 20n - 120 + 90n - 180 = 20n^2 + 110n - 300 \\]\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n\\[ 20n^2 + 60n = 20n^2 + 110n - 300 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( 20n^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 60n = 110n - 300 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( 110n \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ -50n = -300 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( -50 \\):\n\n\\[ n = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the original number of friends is 6.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf \\( n = 6 \\), then \\( c = \\frac{20 \\times 6 \\times 9}{3} = \\frac{1080}{3} = 360 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, check the first scenario: 3 more friends, so 9 friends, each pays \\( \\frac{360}{9} = 40 \\) dollars, which is indeed 20 dollars less than the original \\( \\frac{360}{6} = 60 \\) dollars.\n\nSecond scenario: 2 fewer friends, so 4 friends, each pays \\( \\frac{360}{4} = 90 \\) dollars, which is indeed 30 dollars more than the original 60 dollars.\n\nPerfect, it all checks out. So, the answer is 6 friends.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
