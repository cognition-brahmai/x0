Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\" novels. Hobbits are also fictional creatures created by Tolkien, known for their love of peace, comfort, and simple lives. Therefore, there are no real-life hobbits residing in The Shire, as both hobbits and The Shire exist solely in the realm of fantasy literature."
