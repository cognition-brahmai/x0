        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where one-third of the population are vegetarians. That means if we take the total population and divide it by three, that gives us the number of vegetarians. Now, among these vegetarians, two-fifths are men. So, we need to find out what fraction of the entire town's population are these vegetarian men.\n\nFirst, let's denote the total population of the town as P. Then, the number of vegetarians in the town is (1/3)P. Among these vegetarians, 2/5 are men. So, the number of vegetarian men would be (2/5) of the vegetarians, which is (2/5)*(1/3)P.\n\nNow, to find the fraction of the entire population that are vegetarian men, we need to divide the number of vegetarian men by the total population P.\n\nSo, the fraction would be:\n\n[(2/5)*(1/3)P] / P\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling out P in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(2/5)*(1/3) = 2/15\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the entire population that are vegetarian men is 2/15.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the total population P, one-third are vegetarians, so (1/3)P. Then, among vegetarians, two-fifths are men, so (2/5)*(1/3)P = (2/15)P. So, vegetarian men make up 2/15 of the total population. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider some hypothetical numbers. Let's say the total population is 150 people. Then, the number of vegetarians would be (1/3)*150 = 50 people. Among these 50 vegetarians, two-fifths are men, so (2/5)*50 = 20 men. Therefore, the fraction of vegetarian men in the total population is 20/150 = 2/15, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{15}} \\]"
