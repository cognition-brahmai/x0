        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. We're going to pick two balls one after the other without putting the first one back, and we want to find the probability that the two balls are of different colors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the two balls to be of different colors. That means one is red and the other is blue. It could be red first and then blue, or blue first and then red. So, there are two scenarios to consider here.\n\nLet's consider the first scenario: picking a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\n1. The probability of picking a red ball first: There are 4 red balls out of 10 total balls, so that's 4/10 or 2/5.\n\n2. After picking a red ball, we don't replace it, so now there are 9 balls left in the box, with 6 of them being blue.\n\n3. The probability of picking a blue ball second: 6 out of 9, which is 2/3.\n\nSo, the probability of both events happening in this order is (2/5) * (2/3) = 4/15.\n\nNow, let's consider the second scenario: picking a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\n1. The probability of picking a blue ball first: There are 6 blue balls out of 10 total balls, so that's 6/10 or 3/5.\n\n2. After picking a blue ball, we don't replace it, so now there are 9 balls left in the box, with 4 of them being red.\n\n3. The probability of picking a red ball second: 4 out of 9.\n\nSo, the probability of both events happening in this order is (3/5) * (4/9) = 12/45, which simplifies to 4/15.\n\nNow, since these two scenarios are mutually exclusive (they can't both happen at the same time), we can add their probabilities to find the total probability of picking two balls of different colors.\n\nTotal probability = (4/15) + (4/15) = 8/15.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm that 8/15 is indeed the correct probability?\n\nAnother approach could be to find the probability that both balls are the same color and subtract that from 1, since the only other possibility is that they are different.\n\nSo, probability of both balls being the same color:\n\n- Both red: Probability of first ball being red is 4/10, and then second being red is 3/9 (since one red is already picked), so (4/10)*(3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15.\n\n- Both blue: Probability of first ball being blue is 6/10, and then second being blue is 5/9, so (6/10)*(5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3.\n\nTotal probability of both balls being the same color: 2/15 + 1/3 = 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both balls being different colors is 1 - 7/15 = 8/15.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 8/15 is indeed the correct probability.\n\nLet me see if there's yet another way to think about this to confirm.\n\nWe can consider the total number of ways to pick two balls out of 10, which is combinations of 10 taken 2, which is C(10,2) = 45.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red and one blue: Number of reds times number of blues, which is 4*6 = 24.\n\nTherefore, probability is 24/45, which simplifies to 8/15.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, I'm confident that 8/15 is the correct probability that both balls picked are of different colors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{15}} \\]"
