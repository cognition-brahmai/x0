        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, and each one has a 5% chance of being defective. I need to find out, on average, how many defective widgets are made each day.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"5% chance of being defective\" means. It means that for each widget, there's a 5 in 100 chance that it's not up to standard. So, out of every 100 widgets, approximately 5 might be defective.\n\nBut since the factory makes 1000 widgets, which is ten times more than 100, maybe I can just multiply the number of defective widgets in 100 by 10. So, 5 defective widgets in 100, times 10, would be 50 defective widgets in 1000.\n\nWait, but is that the right way to think about it? I remember from math class that probability can be used to find expected values. The expected value is like the long-term average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents.\n\nSo, in this case, the experiment is producing a widget, and there's a 5% chance it's defective. If I produce 1000 widgets, the expected number of defective widgets would be the probability of a widget being defective multiplied by the total number of widgets.\n\nMathematically, that would be:\n\nExpected defective widgets = Probability of defect * Total widgets\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nExpected defective widgets = 0.05 * 1000 = 50\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier thought. So, on average, 50 widgets are expected to be defective each day.\n\nBut let's dig a bit deeper. What does \"on average\" mean here? Does it mean that every day, exactly 50 widgets will be defective? Probably not, because randomness is involved. Some days, maybe fewer than 50 are defective, and some days, more than 50.\n\nIn statistics, this situation sounds like a binomial distribution, where each widget is like a Bernoulli trial with two possible outcomes: defective or not defective. The probability of success, in this case, is the probability of a widget being defective, which is 0.05.\n\nThe binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success. So, in this factory, each widget is an independent trial with a 0.05 probability of being defective.\n\nThe formula for the expected value in a binomial distribution is indeed n * p, where n is the number of trials (widgets) and p is the probability of success (defect).\n\nSo, expected defective widgets = n * p = 1000 * 0.05 = 50.\n\nMoreover, I can calculate the variance and standard deviation to understand how much the number of defective widgets might vary from the mean.\n\nThe variance of a binomial distribution is n * p * (1 - p).\n\nSo, variance = 1000 * 0.05 * 0.95 = 47.5\n\nAnd the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is approximately 6.89.\n\nThis means that, on average, the number of defective widgets per day will be around 50, plus or minus about 7, give or take.\n\nBut for the purpose of this question, the main thing is the expected value, which is 50.\n\nWait a minute, the question is \"on average, how many defective widgets are produced each day?\" So, the answer is 50.\n\nBut just to make sure, I'll consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nPerhaps using the Poisson distribution? Poisson is often used for modeling the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant mean rate.\n\nIn this case, the mean rate is 50 defective widgets per day, based on the binomial calculation.\n\nBut since the binomial distribution is more straightforward here, with n large and p small, Poisson could be an approximation, but it's not necessary for finding the expected value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 5% of widgets are defective, then the proportion of defective widgets is 0.05.\n\nApplying this proportion to the total production of 1000 widgets gives:\n\nDefective widgets = 0.05 * 1000 = 50\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate this situation.\n\nSuppose I have 1000 widgets, each with a 5% chance of being defective.\n\nIf I were to simulate this many times, say, 1000 times, and each time calculate the number of defective widgets, then the average of those simulations should be close to 50.\n\nIn programming terms, this would involve generating 1000 random numbers between 0 and 1, and counting how many are less than 0.05, and repeating this process many times to find the average.\n\nBut since this is theoretical, and I'm dealing with expected values, the mathematical approach is sufficient and more efficient.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps considering the defective widgets as a random sample from the total production.\n\nIn survey sampling, the expected value of the sample mean is equal to the population mean.\n\nHere, the \"population\" is the daily production of 1000 widgets, and the \"sample\" is the defective ones.\n\nBut that might not be the best way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using linearity of expectation.\n\nLinearity of expectation states that the expected value of the sum of random variables is the sum of their expected values, regardless of dependence.\n\nIn this case, each widget can be considered a random variable that takes value 1 if defective and 0 if not.\n\nSo, for each widget, E[X_i] = 1 * P(defective) + 0 * P(not defective) = 0.05\n\nThen, the total number of defective widgets is X = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_1000\n\nTherefore, E[X] = E[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_1000] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + ... + E[X_1000] = 1000 * 0.05 = 50\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis reinforces that 50 is indeed the correct expected value.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, are there any dependencies between the widgets being defective? If the probability of one widget being defective affects the probability of another, then the binomial assumption of independence might not hold.\n\nBut in this problem, it's not specified that the defects are dependent, so I can assume independence.\n\nAnother consideration: is the 5% defect rate exact, or is it an estimate?\n\nIf it's an estimate, there might be some variability in the defect rate itself, but again, for the purpose of this question, we can take 5% as given.\n\nAlso, the factory produces 1000 widgets per day, but is there any variation in daily production?\n\nThe question states \"1000 widgets per day,\" so I can assume that the daily production is constant at 1000.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of defective widgets per day is 50.\n\nTo summarize, using the binomial distribution and the concept of expected value, the average number of defective widgets produced each day is 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
