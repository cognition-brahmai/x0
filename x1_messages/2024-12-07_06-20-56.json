        "content": "Spain is known for its rich wine culture and production. However, when comparing wine consumption across countries, it's important to look at statistics and trends. According to recent data from the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), several countries consume more wine per capita than Spain.\n\nFor instance, countries like Portugal, France, Italy, and Greece typically have higher wine consumption rates. In fact, France is often at the top of the list for wine consumption per capita. So, while Spain does have a significant wine-drinking culture, there are other countries where individuals drink more wine on average.\n\nIt's also worth noting that wine consumption can vary greatly depending on regional preferences, cultural habits, and even historical traditions. So, while national averages can give us a general idea, local variations can be substantial."
