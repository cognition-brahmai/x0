        "content": "I'm here to help you with your Python script to interact with the Kubernetes API. To achieve this, we'll need to use the official Kubernetes Python client library. If you haven't already installed it, you can do so using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install kubernetes\n```\n\nOnce you have the library installed, you can proceed to write the script. Below is a step-by-step guide and a sample script to list all running pods in a specific namespace and print their names and statuses.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Import necessary modules:**\n   - `from kubernetes import client, config`\n\n2. **Load Kubernetes configuration:**\n   - Use `config.load_kube_config()` to load the configuration from the default location (~/.kube/config). If you're running this inside a cluster, use `config.load_incluster_config()`.\n\n3. **Create a Kubernetes API client:**\n   - Use `client.CoreV1Api()` to create a client for the Core V1 API, which handles pods.\n\n4. **List pods in the specified namespace:**\n   - Use the `list_namespaced_pod` method of the CoreV1Api client, passing the namespace as an argument.\n\n5. **Filter and print pod names and statuses:**\n   - Iterate through the list of pods and print their names and statuses.\n\n### Sample Script:\n\n```python\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\n\ndef main():\n    # Load Kubernetes configuration\n    config.load_kube_config()\n\n    # Create a Kubernetes API client\n    v1 = client.CoreV1Api()\n\n    # Specify the namespace\n    namespace = \"your-namespace\"  # Replace with your namespace\n\n    # List pods in the specified namespace\n    print(f\"Listing pods in namespace: {namespace}\")\n    ret = v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace)\n    \n    for i in ret.items:\n        print(f\"Pod Name: {i.metadata.name}, Status: {i.status.phase}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loading Configuration:**\n   - `config.load_kube_config()`: This function loads the configuration from the default kube-config file, which is usually located at ~/.kube/config. This is suitable for local development.\n   - If you're running this script inside a Kubernetes cluster, you should use `config.load_incluster_config()` instead.\n\n2. **Creating API Client:**\n   - `client.CoreV1Api()`: This creates a client for the Core V1 API, which allows us to interact with pods, services, and other core Kubernetes resources.\n\n3. **Listing Pods:**\n   - `v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace)`: This method lists all pods in the specified namespace. The result is a `V1PodList` object containing a list of `V1Pod` objects.\n\n4. **Printing Pod Information:**\n   - We iterate through the list of pods and print each pod's name and status phase.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Namespace:** Make sure to replace `\"your-namespace\"` with the actual namespace you want to query.\n- **Permissions:** Ensure that the user configured in the kube-config file has the necessary permissions to list pods in the specified namespace.\n- **Error Handling:** For a more robust script, consider adding error handling to manage cases where the namespace does not exist or the user lacks permissions.\n\nThis script should give you a good starting point for interacting with the Kubernetes API using Python to manage and monitor your pods.
