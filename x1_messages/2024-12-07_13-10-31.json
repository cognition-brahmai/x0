        "content": "Let's see. The train is going at 60 miles per hour and travels for 30 minutes, then stops for 15 minutes, and then continues. We need to find out how far it's traveled after a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the time segments. The total time is 1 hour and 15 minutes, which is 75 minutes. The train travels for 30 minutes, stops for 15 minutes, and then continues. So, the traveling time is 30 minutes plus some more time after the stop.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The train travels for 30 minutes at 60 miles per hour.\n\n2. It stops for 15 minutes.\n\n3. Then it continues traveling.\n\nThe total time from the start is 1 hour and 15 minutes, which is 75 minutes.\n\nSo, the time after the stop is 75 minutes minus the initial 30 minutes of travel and 15 minutes of stop.\n\nThat would be 75 - 30 - 15 = 30 minutes.\n\nSo, the train travels for 30 minutes, stops for 15 minutes, and then travels again for 30 minutes.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the distance traveled in these two travel segments.\n\nFirst segment: 30 minutes at 60 miles per hour.\n\nSecond segment: 30 minutes at 60 miles per hour.\n\nSo, total distance is the sum of these two distances.\n\nBut wait, is the speed the same for both segments? The question says the train travels at 60 miles per hour, and doesn't mention any change in speed, so I'll assume it's the same.\n\nNow, to find the distance, I know that distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nFirst, convert the time to hours since the speed is in miles per hour.\n\n30 minutes is 0.5 hours.\n\nSo, first segment: 60 mph \u00d7 0.5 hours = 30 miles.\n\nSecond segment: another 60 mph \u00d7 0.5 hours = 30 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 30 + 30 = 60 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal time is 75 minutes.\n\nTravel time is 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.\n\nStop time is 15 minutes.\n\nSo, 60 minutes of travel plus 15 minutes of stop, totaling 75 minutes.\n\nAnd distance is 60 miles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the entire journey.\n\nThe train travels for a total of 60 minutes (since it stops for 15 minutes in the 75-minute period).\n\nSo, distance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 60 miles.\n\nWait, but the stop is included in the total time, so the actual traveling time is less than 75 minutes.\n\nWait, no. The stop is a break, so the train is not moving during that time.\n\nSo, total time: 30 minutes traveling, 15 minutes stopping, and then 30 minutes traveling again.\n\nSo, total traveling time is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes, or 1 hour.\n\nSo, distance = 60 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 60 miles.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the train had traveled for the entire 75 minutes at 60 mph, but it stopped for 15 minutes, so we need to subtract that stop time.\n\nBut no, actually, the stop time is when the train is not moving, so only the traveling time counts for distance.\n\nSo, total traveling time is 60 minutes, or 1 hour, at 60 mph, so 60 miles.\n\nYes, I think 60 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
