        "content": "So, the train goes from City A to City B at an average speed of 90 kilometers per hour, and it takes 5 hours to make the trip. We need to find out how far apart these two cities are.\n\nWell, to find the distance between two points when you know the speed and the time, you can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 90 km/h, and the time is 5 hours. So, plugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 90 km/h \u00d7 5 h\n\nWhen you multiply these, the hours unit cancels out, leaving you with kilometers.\n\nSo, Distance = 450 kilometers\n\nTherefore, City A and City B are 450 kilometers apart.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it another way. If the train is going at 90 km/h, that means it covers 90 kilometers every hour. Over 5 hours, it would cover:\n\n90 km/h \u00d7 5 h = 450 km\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if you wanted to double-check, you could consider that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time = distance / speed. We know the time is 5 hours and the speed is 90 km/h, so:\n\n5 h = distance / 90 km/h\n\nTo find the distance, you can rearrange the equation:\n\nDistance = 5 h \u00d7 90 km/h = 450 km\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which way you look at it, the distance between City A and City B is 450 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]"
