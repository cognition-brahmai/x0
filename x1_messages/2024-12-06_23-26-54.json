        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the baker uses 3 eggs for each cake she bakes. Yesterday, she used up all her eggs to bake as many cakes as possible. She started with two dozen eggs. We need to find out how many cakes she baked.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many eggs are in two dozen. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen would be:\n\n2 x 12 = 24 eggs\n\nSo, she started with 24 eggs.\n\nNext, she uses 3 eggs for each cake. To find out how many cakes she can bake with 24 eggs, I should divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per cake:\n\n24 eggs \u00f7 3 eggs/cake = 8 cakes\n\nTherefore, she baked 8 cakes.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Let's see. If she uses 3 eggs per cake and she has 24 eggs, then indeed, 24 divided by 3 is 8. That seems straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider how many sets of 3 eggs are there in 24 eggs. Again, that would be 24 divided by 3, which is 8.\n\nOr, I could think in terms of multiplication. If each cake requires 3 eggs, then for 8 cakes, she would need:\n\n8 cakes x 3 eggs/cake = 24 eggs\n\nThis matches the number of eggs she had, so it checks out.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The answer should be 8 cakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
