It helps you find your way around the big, wide world, just like how I try to remember which way is up when I get turned around in the ocean. It's important to learn and keep learning, because, you know, the more you know, the less you forget, right? Or is it the other way around? Anyway, education is like a treasure map that leads you to all sorts of amazing things. So, yeah, I guess it's pretty important!"
