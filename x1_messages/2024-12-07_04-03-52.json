        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're told that the ratio of men to women in a city is 7:5, and the total population is 36,000 people. We need to find out how many more men there are than women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 7:5 means that for every 7 men, there are 5 women. So, the total parts of the population are 7 + 5 = 12 parts.\n\nNow, since the total population is 36,000, each part of the population should be 36,000 divided by 12. Let's calculate that:\n\n36,000 \u00f7 12 = 3,000\n\nSo, each part represents 3,000 people.\n\nNow, to find the number of men, I multiply the number of parts for men by the number of people per part:\n\nMen: 7 parts \u00d7 3,000 = 21,000\n\nSimilarly, for women:\n\nWomen: 5 parts \u00d7 3,000 = 15,000\n\nNow, to find out how many more men there are than women, I subtract the number of women from the number of men:\n\n21,000 - 15,000 = 6,000\n\nSo, there are 6,000 more men than women in the city.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check our calculations.\n\nTotal parts: 7 + 5 = 12\n\nEach part: 36,000 \u00f7 12 = 3,000\n\nMen: 7 \u00d7 3,000 = 21,000\n\nWomen: 5 \u00d7 3,000 = 15,000\n\nDifference: 21,000 - 15,000 = 6,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of fractions. Since the ratio is 7:5, the fraction of the population that is men is 7/12, and for women, it's 5/12.\n\nSo, men: (7/12) \u00d7 36,000 = 21,000\n\nWomen: (5/12) \u00d7 36,000 = 15,000\n\nDifference: 21,000 - 15,000 = 6,000\n\nSame answer.\n\nOr, I could use algebra. Let\u2019s let the number of men be 7x and the number of women be 5x. Then, 7x + 5x = 36,000\n\n12x = 36,000\n\nX = 3,000\n\nSo, men: 7 \u00d7 3,000 = 21,000\n\nWomen: 5 \u00d7 3,000 = 15,000\n\nDifference: 21,000 - 15,000 = 6,000\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear that there are 6,000 more men than women in the city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
