        "content": "The pyramids in Egypt are based on a geometric shape called a square pyramid. A square pyramid has a square base and four triangular faces that meet at a single point, known as the apex. The most famous examples are the Great Pyramids of Giza, which were built as tombs for pharaohs during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods of ancient Egypt. These structures are not only architectural marvels but also hold significant historical and cultural importance."
