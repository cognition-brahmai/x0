        "content": "So, imagine you have a big pot of water that's boiling, right? It's all bubbly and hot. Now, if you put one egg into this pot, it takes about 10 minutes to get nice and boiled inside.\n\nNow, what if you want to boil not just one egg, but five eggs? Do you think it would take longer because there are more eggs?\n\nWell, here's the thing: when you put five eggs into the same big pot of boiling water, they all start cooking at the same time. The water is hot enough to cook all of them together. So, even though there are five eggs instead of one, they still only need about 10 minutes to cook through.\n\nIt's kind of like when you're playing with your toys. If you have one toy to play with, it takes a certain amount of time. If you have five toys, you might play with them all at the same time, but it doesn't necessarily make the playtime longer, right?\n\nSo, boiling five eggs takes about the same 10 minutes as boiling one egg, because they're all in the hot water together, cooking at the same time.\n\nBut, there is a tiny catch! If you put too many eggs in the pot, they might not have enough space to move around, and that could affect how evenly they cook. So, it's good to make sure there's enough room in the pot for all the eggs.\n\nAlso, sometimes, if you have a really big pot and lots of water, it might take a little bit longer for the water to come back to a boil after you add the eggs. But usually, that doesn't add much time.\n\nSo, in simple terms: 10 minutes for one egg, and about the same 10 minutes for five eggs, as long as they all fit comfortably in the pot.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n"
