        "content": "So here's the scenario: Sarah hides her favorite toy in the closet at a birthday party to keep it safe from other children. While she's playing outside, her mom finds the toy in the closet and moves it to the attic to prevent it from being accidentally found by the guests. Later, Sarah's cousin goes into the attic, sees the toy, and takes it downstairs to play with it. Finally, Sarah comes back inside looking for her toy.\n\nThe question is, where will Sarah think her toy is?\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Sarah hides her toy in the closet. She knows exactly where she hid it, right? So, in her mind, that's the last place she remembers putting it.\n\nNow, while she's gone to play outside, her mom finds the toy in the closet and moves it to the attic. But Sarah doesn't know that her mom moved it, because she wasn't there when it happened.\n\nLater, Sarah's cousin goes to the attic, finds the toy, and takes it downstairs to play with it. Again, Sarah wasn't present for this, so she doesn't know about this movement either.\n\nSo, when Sarah comes back inside looking for her toy, what does she know?\n\nShe knows she hid it in the closet, and she hasn't been told otherwise. She doesn't know that her mom moved it to the attic, and she doesn't know that her cousin took it downstairs.\n\nTherefore, logically, Sarah will think her toy is still in the closet where she left it.\n\nBut, let's consider if there's any chance she might think differently.\n\nMaybe she remembers that her mom sometimes tidies up the house, and perhaps she might suspect that her mom might have moved it. But the problem states that Sarah hid it to keep it safe from other children, and she specifically chose the closet for that purpose. So, it's likely that she chose the closet because it's a safe, out-of-the-way place where adults might not look.\n\nAlso, her mom moved it to the attic, which is another place that might be out of Sarah's immediate reach. So, perhaps Sarah might not even think to look in the attic, assuming her mom would put it somewhere safe.\n\nFurthermore, since Sarah's cousin took it downstairs to play with it, if Sarah comes inside and sees her cousin playing with it downstairs, she might naturally assume that her cousin took it from where she hid it.\n\nBut the question is, where will she think it is when she comes back inside to look for it.\n\nGiven that she hid it in the closet, and she hasn't been informed otherwise, she will initially think it's in the closet.\n\nHowever, if she goes to the closet and it's not there, she might start to wonder where it could be.\n\nShe might consider that her mom moved it to the attic, but since she doesn't know about that, it's just a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, she might think that one of the guests found it despite her hiding it well.\n\nBut initially, before checking any places, where does she think it is?\n\nIn the closet, because that's where she left it.\n\nSo, the answer should be that Sarah thinks her toy is in the closet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{closet}} \\]"
