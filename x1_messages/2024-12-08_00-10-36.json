        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 120 students in total at the school. Out of these, 40% play soccer, and 30% play basketball. Additionally, 15% play both soccer and basketball. We need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many students play soccer. Since 40% of 120 students play soccer, I can calculate that by multiplying 120 by 40%:\n\n120 * 40% = 120 * 0.4 = 48 students\n\nSo, 48 students play soccer.\n\nNext, 30% of the students play basketball. Let's calculate that:\n\n120 * 30% = 120 * 0.3 = 36 students\n\nSo, 36 students play basketball.\n\nNow, 15% of the students play both soccer and basketball. Let's find out how many that is:\n\n120 * 15% = 120 * 0.15 = 18 students\n\nSo, 18 students play both sports.\n\nTo find out how many students play either soccer or basketball or both, I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps me avoid double-counting the students who play both sports.\n\nThe formula for inclusion-exclusion in this case is:\n\nNumber of students who play soccer or basketball = (Number who play soccer) + (Number who play basketball) - (Number who play both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 48 + 36 - 18 = 66 students\n\nSo, 66 students play either soccer or basketball or both.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I'll subtract the number of students who play at least one sport from the total number of students:\n\nTotal students - Students who play at least one sport = Students who don't play either sport\n\n120 - 66 = 54 students\n\nTherefore, 54 students don't play either soccer or basketball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I calculated the number of students playing soccer: 40% of 120 is indeed 48.\n\nThen, basketball players: 30% of 120 is 36.\n\nBoth sports: 15% of 120 is 18.\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion: 48 + 36 - 18 = 66 students play at least one sport.\n\nTotal students are 120, so 120 - 66 = 54 students don't play either sport.\n\nThat seems correct. Another way to look at it is to use the concept of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- S as the set of students who play soccer.\n\n- B as the set of students who play basketball.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |S| = 48\n\n- |B| = 36\n\n- |S \u2229 B| = 18\n\nWe need to find the number of students who are not in set S or B, which is the complement of S union B.\n\nFirst, find |S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B| = 48 + 36 - 18 = 66\n\nThen, the number of students not playing either sport is total students minus those in S \u222a B, which is 120 - 66 = 54.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of percentages.\n\nTotal percentage of students playing at least one sport is:\n\nPercentage playing soccer + Percentage playing basketball - Percentage playing both\n\nWhich is 40% + 30% - 15% = 55%\n\nThen, the percentage of students not playing either sport is 100% - 55% = 45%\n\nSo, 45% of 120 students don't play either sport.\n\nLet's calculate that: 120 * 45% = 120 * 0.45 = 54 students\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 54 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
