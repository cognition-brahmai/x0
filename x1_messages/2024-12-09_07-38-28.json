        "content": "So I have this problem here: a fruit seller sells 150 apples in a day. I need to find out how many apples he sells in a month of February in a leap year. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many days are in February during a leap year. I remember that February usually has 28 days, but in a leap year, it has 29 days. So, in a leap year, February has 29 days.\n\nNext, if the fruit seller sells 150 apples each day, and February has 29 days, then the total number of apples sold in February would be 150 apples/day multiplied by 29 days.\n\nSo, let's do the math:\n\n150 apples/day \u00d7 29 days = ?\n\nI can calculate this step by step. First, 150 \u00d7 20 = 3000, because 150 \u00d7 20 is like 150 \u00d7 2 = 300, then add a zero to get 3000.\n\nThen, 150 \u00d7 9 = 1350, because 150 \u00d7 10 = 1500, and subtract 150 to get 1350.\n\nNow, add those two results together: 3000 + 1350 = 4350.\n\nSo, the fruit seller sells 4350 apples in February of a leap year.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there any other factor that could affect the total number of apples sold? For example, maybe some days he sells more or less, but the problem says he sells 150 apples per day, so I think it's safe to assume it's a constant amount.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I've correctly identified the number of days in February during a leap year. Yes, 29 days is correct.\n\nSo, my final answer is 4350 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4350} \\]\n"
