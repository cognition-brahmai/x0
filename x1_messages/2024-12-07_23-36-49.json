        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 people, and together they have 25 apples. Each person has an odd number of apples. I need to figure out how many apples the person with the most apples has.\n\nFirst, I know that odd numbers are like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, each person has one of these numbers of apples.\n\nIf I add up five odd numbers, what do I get? Let me think about that. An odd number plus another odd number is even, right? Then, adding another odd makes it odd again, and so on.\n\nLet me try to add five odd numbers:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 1 + 3 is 4 (even), plus 5 is 9 (odd), plus 7 is 16 (even), plus 9 is 25 (odd).\n\nHey, that adds up to 25, which is what we need.\n\nSo, one possible distribution is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nBut is this the only way? Maybe there are other combinations of five odd numbers that add up to 25.\n\nLet me try another set: 3, 3, 5, 5, 9.\n\n3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 9 = 3+3=6, 6+5=11, 11+5=16, 16+9=25.\n\nThat works too.\n\nAnother one: 1, 1, 7, 7, 9.\n\n1+1=2, 2+7=9, 9+7=16, 16+9=25.\n\nOkay, so there are multiple combinations.\n\nThe question is, how many apples does the person with the most apples have?\n\nIn the first case, it's 9.\n\nIn the second case, it's also 9.\n\nIn the third case, it's 9 again.\n\nHmm, is it always 9?\n\nWait, maybe I can have higher numbers.\n\nLet me try: 1, 1, 1, 3, 19.\n\n1+1=2, 2+1=3, 3+3=6, 6+19=25.\n\nThat works too, and here the maximum is 19.\n\nOr 1, 1, 1, 5, 17.\n\n1+1=2, 2+1=3, 3+5=8, 8+17=25.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum is 17.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure that all numbers are odd.\n\n1, 1, 1, 3, 19: all odd.\n\n1, 1, 1, 5, 17: all odd.\n\nSo, it seems like the maximum can be higher than 9.\n\nIn fact, it can be as high as 23.\n\nLet me try: 1, 1, 1, 1, 21.\n\n1+1=2, 2+1=3, 3+1=4, 4+21=25.\n\nAll odd numbers, and the maximum is 21.\n\nWait, but 21 is odd, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, 1, 1, 3, 3, 17.\n\n1+1=2, 2+3=5, 5+3=8, 8+17=25.\n\nAll odd, maximum is 17.\n\nSo, it seems like the maximum can vary.\n\nIs there a limit to how high the maximum can be?\n\nWell, the smallest four odd numbers are 1, 1, 1, 1, which sum to 4.\n\nSo, the maximum would be 25 - 4 = 21.\n\nSimilarly, if three people have 1 apple each, totaling 3, then the remaining two must have an odd number that sums to 22.\n\nBut 22 is even, and the sum of two odd numbers is even, so that's possible.\n\nFor example, 1, 1, 1, x, y, where x and y are odd and x + y = 22.\n\nPossible pairs could be (3,19), (5,17), (7,15), (9,13), etc.\n\nAll of these have y = 19, 17, 15, 13, etc.\n\nSo, in these cases, the maximum is 19, 17, 15, 13, etc.\n\nWait, but earlier I had a maximum of 21.\n\nWait, if four people have 1 apple each, total 4, then the fifth person would have 21 apples.\n\nBut 21 is odd, so that works.\n\nAlternatively, if three people have 1 apple each, total 3, and the other two have, say, 3 and 19.\n\nThat works too.\n\nSo, the maximum can be up to 21 apples.\n\nIs 23 possible?\n\nIf four people have 1 apple each, total 4, then the fifth would need 21 apples, as 25 - 4 = 21.\n\n23 is higher than 21, so no, 23 is not possible.\n\nWait, maybe if someone has negative apples?\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, the maximum is 21 apples.\n\nBut in the earlier example, I had 1, 1, 1, 1, 21.\n\nThat seems to be the maximum possible for one person.\n\nBut is there a way to have higher than that?\n\nWait, if three people have 1 apple each, total 3, then the other two need to have a sum of 22.\n\nThe highest odd number less than or equal to 22 is 21, but 21 + 1 = 22, but then one person has 21 and another has 1.\n\nSo, still, the maximum is 21.\n\nAlternatively, if two people have 1 apple each, total 2, then the other three need to have a sum of 23.\n\nBut 23 is odd, and the sum of three odd numbers is odd, which works.\n\nBut, in this case, the maximum could be higher.\n\nFor example, 1, 1, x, y, z, where x, y, z are odd and x + y + z = 23.\n\nTo maximize one of them, say z, we need to minimize x and y.\n\nThe smallest odd numbers are 1, 1, so let's set x = 1, y = 1.\n\nThen z = 23 - 1 - 1 = 21.\n\nSo, again, z = 21.\n\nAlternatively, x = 1, y = 3, then z = 23 - 1 - 3 = 19.\n\nStill, z = 19, which is less than 21.\n\nSo, the maximum is still 21.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if four people have 1 apple each, total 4, then the fifth has 21.\n\nIs there a way to have five people with odd numbers of apples summing to 25, with one having more than 21?\n\nLet me try: 1, 1, 1, 3, 19.\n\nSum is 1+1+1+3+19 = 25.\n\nMaximum is 19.\n\nOr 1, 1, 1, 5, 17.\n\nSum is 25, maximum is 17.\n\nOr 1, 1, 3, 3, 17.\n\nSum is 25, maximum is 17.\n\nOr 1, 1, 3, 5, 15.\n\nSum is 25, maximum is 15.\n\nOr 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nSum is 25, maximum is 9.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the maximum is less than or equal to 21.\n\nWait, but in the first case I considered, with 1,1,1,1,21, the maximum is 21.\n\nIs there a way to have one person with 23 apples?\n\nIf one person has 23, then the remaining four need to have a total of 2 apples.\n\nBut 2 is even, and the sum of four odd numbers is even, which is possible.\n\nFor example, four people have 1 apple each, total 4, but 25 - 4 = 21, not 23.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, 25 - 23 = 2.\n\nSo, the other four people would have to have a total of 2 apples.\n\nBut since each has an odd number of apples, the smallest odd number is 1, so four people would have at least 4 apples, which is more than 2.\n\nSo, it's impossible for one person to have 23 apples.\n\nTherefore, the maximum is 21 apples.\n\nWait, but in the combination 1,1,1,1,21, the sum is 1+1+1+1+21=25, which works.\n\nSo, 21 is achievable.\n\nIs there a way to have 23 apples for one person?\n\nIf one person has 23, then the remaining four need to have a total of 2 apples.\n\nBut since each of the four must have at least 1 apple, that's 4 apples, which is more than 2.\n\nSo, it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the person with the most apples has 21 apples.\n\nWait, but in my earlier examples, I had combinations where the maximum is less than 21.\n\nDoes the question specify that all possibilities are allowed, or is there a specific scenario?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the apples are distributed in such a way that each person has a distinct number of apples.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify that the numbers have to be distinct.\n\nIn fact, in my earlier examples, some people have the same number of apples.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum can be higher if repeats are allowed.\n\nWait, but in the combination 1,1,1,1,21, repeats are allowed, and the maximum is 21.\n\nAlternatively, 1,1,1,3,19.\n\nStill, the maximum is 19, which is less than 21.\n\nWait, but 1,1,1,1,21 seems valid.\n\nAlternatively, 1,1,1,5,17.\n\nSum is 25, maximum is 17.\n\nSo, again, 21 is higher.\n\nWait, but 1,1,1,1,21 is a valid combination.\n\nIs there a way to have one person with 23 apples?\n\nIf one person has 23, then the remaining four need to have a total of 2 apples.\n\nBut since each must have at least 1 apple, that's impossible.\n\nBecause four people would need to have a total of 4 apples at minimum, which is more than 2.\n\nTherefore, 21 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps if some people have fewer apples.\n\nWait, no, the minimum is 1 apple per person, right?\n\nBecause \"each person has an odd number of apples\", and the smallest odd number is 1.\n\nSo, if four people have 1 apple each, the fifth must have 21 apples.\n\nAlternatively, if three people have 1 apple each, and two have 3 and 19, that still gives a maximum of 19, which is less than 21.\n\nSimilarly, if two people have 1 apple each, and the other three have 3, 5, and 16, but 16 is even, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no, 16 is even, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the other three would need to have odd numbers summing to 23.\n\nFor example, 3, 7, 13.\n\nSum is 3+7+13=23.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum is 13.\n\nStill less than 21.\n\nAlternatively, 5, 5, 13.\n\nSum is 23.\n\nBut 5 + 5 + 13 = 23.\n\nSo, maximum is 13 again.\n\nOr 1, 11, 11.\n\nSum is 1 + 11 + 11 = 23.\n\nMaximum is 11.\n\nStill less than 21.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the maximum is less than 21.\n\nTherefore, the highest possible number of apples one person can have is 21.\n\nBut in the combination where four people have 1 apple each, and one has 21, that seems to be the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to have one person with 25 apples?\n\nIf one person has 25, then the others would have 0, but 0 is even, which is invalid.\n\nBecause each person must have an odd number of apples, and 0 is even.\n\nTherefore, 25 is not possible.\n\nSo, the maximum is indeed 21 apples.\n\nWait, but in the combination where four people have 1 apple each, and one has 21, that sums to 25.\n\nIs there any other combination where one person can have more than 21?\n\nLet's see.\n\nSuppose three people have 1 apple each, totaling 3, and the other two need to have a sum of 22.\n\nThe highest odd number less than or equal to 22 is 21.\n\nSo, one person has 21, and the other has 1.\n\nSum is 22.\n\nTotal is 25.\n\nMaximum is 21.\n\nAlternatively, if two people have 1 apple each, totaling 2, and the other three need to have a sum of 23.\n\nThe highest odd number less than or equal to 23 is 21.\n\nSo, one person has 21, and the other two have 1 each.\n\nBut that would sum to 21 + 1 + 1 = 23, plus the two people with 1 apple each, total 25.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum is still 21.\n\nSimilarly, if one person has 21 apples, and the other four have 1 apple each, total is 25.\n\nSo, in all these scenarios, the maximum is 21 apples.\n\nTherefore, the person with the most apples has 21 apples.\n\nBut wait, in the initial example I had 1,3,5,7,9 summing to 25, with the maximum being 9.\n\nSo, is there a way to have the maximum less than 21?\n\nYes, there are many ways.\n\nBut the question is, how many apples does the person with the most apples have?\n\nGiven that, it seems like the maximum can vary from 9 up to 21.\n\nBut the question seems to expect a specific answer.\n\nPerhaps I need to find the minimum possible maximum.\n\nWait, maybe the question is to find the minimum number of apples the person with the most apples can have.\n\nIn that case, we need to maximize the apples of the other people to minimize the maximum.\n\nSo, if we give as many apples as possible to the other four people, then the fifth person would have the remainder.\n\nWhat's the maximum number of apples the other four can have?\n\nEach has an odd number, so the maximum for four people would be 1,1,1,1, totaling 4.\n\nThen the fifth person would have 21 apples.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to maximize the apples of the four people without making their counts too low.\n\nWait, but to minimize the maximum, I should maximize the apples of the other four.\n\nBut they are constrained to have odd numbers.\n\nSo, the more apples I give to the other four, the fewer are left for the fifth person.\n\nBut the question is about the person with the most apples.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the distribution where the apples are as evenly distributed as possible.\n\nSo, 25 divided by 5 is 5.\n\nBut 5 is odd, but 5*5=25, which is exactly 25.\n\nIn this case, everyone has 5 apples, so the person with the most apples has 5.\n\nBut in this distribution, all have the same number.\n\nBut the question says each person has an odd number of apples.\n\n5 is odd, so this is a valid distribution.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum is 5.\n\nHowever, earlier I found that the maximum can be up to 21.\n\nSo, depending on the distribution, the maximum can vary from 5 to 21.\n\nBut the question is, how many apples does the person with the most apples have?\n\nIt seems like without additional constraints, the answer can vary.\n\nBut perhaps the question is to find the minimal possible maximum.\n\nThat is, in the most even distribution, what is the maximum?\n\nIn the distribution where everyone has 5 apples, the maximum is 5.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nWait, 5*5=25, which works.\n\nAlternatively, if one person has more than 5, someone else must have less than 5.\n\nBut since all numbers must be odd and positive integers, the minimum is 1.\n\nSo, for example, if one person has 7 apples, then the remaining four need to have a sum of 18.\n\nEach has an odd number, so possible distributions could be 1,3,5,9, which sum to 18.\n\nBut 9 is higher than 7, so in this case, the person with the most apples has 9.\n\nWait, but in this distribution, 7 is not the maximum.\n\nThe maximum is 9.\n\nSo, if one person has 7, the others might have higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, if one person has 7, and the others have 1,3,5,9, but 1+3+5+9=18, plus 7 is 25.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum is 9, not 7.\n\nSo, the person with the most apples still has 9.\n\nAlternatively, if one person has 9, and the others have 1,1,1,1, summing to 4, total is 13, which is less than 25.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, if one person has 9, and the others have 1,1,1,1, sum is 12, plus 9 is 21, which is less than 25.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if one person has 9, and the others have 1,1,3,11.\n\nSum is 1+1+3+11=16, plus 9 is 25.\n\nIn this case, the maximum is 11.\n\nWait, but 11 is higher than 9.\n\nSo, the person with the most apples has 11.\n\nAlternatively, 1,1,3,5,15.\n\nSum is 1+1+3+5+15=25.\n\nHere, the maximum is 15.\n\nSo, in this distribution, the person with the most apples has 15.\n\nWait, but earlier I had a distribution where the maximum is 21.\n\nSo, it seems like the maximum can vary depending on the distribution.\n\nTherefore, the person with the most apples can have anywhere from 5 to 21 apples, given the constraints.\n\nBut perhaps the question is to find the minimal possible maximum.\n\nThat is, in the most even distribution, what is the maximum?\n\nIn the distribution where everyone has 5 apples, the maximum is 5.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nYes, because 5 is odd, and 5*5=25.\n\nSo, that's a valid distribution.\n\nAlternatively, if one person has more than 5, someone else must have less than 5.\n\nBut since the minimum is 1, it's possible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible maximum is 5.\n\nBut in that case, all have 5 apples.\n\nHowever, if the distribution is not even, the maximum can be higher, up to 21.\n\nSo, the person with the most apples can have between 5 and 21 apples, depending on the distribution.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects a specific answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of apples each person has as a, b, c, d, e, where all are odd positive integers, and a + b + c + d + e = 25.\n\nWe need to find the maximum among a, b, c, d, e.\n\nSince all are odd, we can express them as a = 2x + 1, b = 2y + 1, c = 2z + 1, d = 2w + 1, e = 2v + 1, where x, y, z, w, v are non-negative integers.\n\nThen, a + b + c + d + e = (2x + 1) + (2y + 1) + (2z + 1) + (2w + 1) + (2v + 1) = 2(x + y + z + w + v) + 5 = 25.\n\nSo, 2(x + y + z + w + v) + 5 = 25 \u21d2 2(x + y + z + w + v) = 20 \u21d2 x + y + z + w + v = 10.\n\nNow, we need to maximize one of a, b, c, d, e, which is equivalent to maximizing one of 2x + 1, 2y + 1, etc.\n\nTo maximize a = 2x + 1, we need to minimize the other variables.\n\nThe minimal value for y, z, w, v is 0, since they are non-negative integers.\n\nSo, set y = z = w = v = 0.\n\nThen, x + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 10 \u21d2 x = 10.\n\nTherefore, a = 2*10 + 1 = 21.\n\nSo, the maximum number of apples one person can have is 21.\n\nSimilarly, if we set x = 10 and y = z = w = v = 0, then a = 21, and b = c = d = e = 1.\n\nSum is 21 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25.\n\nThis satisfies all conditions.\n\nAlternatively, if we set x = 9, then y + z + w + v = 1.\n\nFor example, x = 9, y = 1, z = w = v = 0.\n\nThen, a = 19, b = 3, c = d = e = 1.\n\nSum is 19 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25.\n\nIn this case, the maximum is 19.\n\nBut to maximize one person's apples, we set the others to the minimal possible, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the person with the most apples has 21 apples.\n\nSo, the answer is 21.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
