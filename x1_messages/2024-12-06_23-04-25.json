        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and 10% of those are defective. So, first I need to find out how many widgets are non-defective each day.\n\nIf 10% are defective, then 90% must be non-defective, right? Because 100% - 10% = 90%.\n\nSo, non-defective widgets per day = 90% of 1000.\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 1000 by 0.9 (since 90% is the same as 0.9 in decimal form).\n\n1000 \u00d7 0.9 = 900.\n\nSo, the factory produces 900 non-defective widgets each day.\n\nNow, the factory operates 6 days a week. To find out the weekly production of non-defective widgets, I need to multiply the daily non-defective production by the number of operating days in a week.\n\n900 widgets/day \u00d7 6 days/week = 5400 widgets/week.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me think again: 1000 widgets per day, 10% defective.\n\nDefective widgets per day = 10% of 1000 = 1000 \u00d7 0.1 = 100.\n\nSo, non-defective widgets per day = total widgets - defective widgets = 1000 - 100 = 900.\n\nYes, that matches what I did earlier.\n\nThen, over 6 days, 900 \u00d7 6 = 5400.\n\nI don't see any mistakes here. The factory produces 5400 non-defective widgets in a week.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this number. For example, does the factory's production rate change on certain days? Is there any information about varying defect rates? From the information given, it seems like the production and defect rates are constant every day.\n\nAlso, the factory operates 6 days a week, so I assume it's closed one day a week. I shouldn't include that day in the calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by calculating the total weekly production first and then applying the defect rate.\n\nTotal weekly production = 1000 widgets/day \u00d7 6 days/week = 6000 widgets/week.\n\nThen, defective widgets per week = 10% of 6000 = 600.\n\nTherefore, non-defective widgets per week = 6000 - 600 = 5400.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, since 90% are non-defective, 90% of 6000 is also 5400.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same number.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the factory produces 5400 non-defective widgets in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5400} \\]"
