        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bags of candy. The store says they have an average weight of 250 grams per bag, and the weights follow a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 25 grams. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected bag weighs between 225 and 275 grams. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. The mean here is 250 grams, and the standard deviation is 25 grams. The normal distribution is often represented by a bell curve, where the mean is right in the center, and the standard deviations mark how spread out the data is.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the probability that a bag's weight is between 225 and 275 grams. Let me visualize this. If the mean is 250 grams, then 225 grams is 25 grams below the mean, and 275 grams is 25 grams above the mean. Since the standard deviation is 25 grams, that means 225 grams is one standard deviation below the mean, and 275 grams is one standard deviation above the mean.\n\nI think there's a rule or formula that can help me find the probability within one standard deviation of the mean. Hmm, I recall something about 68-95-99.7 rule in normal distributions. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nThe 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule, states that for a normal distribution:\n\n- Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\n- Approximately 95% falls within two standard deviations.\n\n- Approximately 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n\nIn this case, since 225 and 275 grams are one standard deviation below and above the mean, respectively, the probability that a bag's weight falls between these two values should be approximately 68%.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems almost too straightforward. Maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me try to confirm this with the z-score method, just to be sure. The z-score is a way to standardize the values so that they can be compared to a standard normal distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\nThe formula for z-score is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere:\n\n- X is the value from the distribution,\n\n- \u03bc is the mean,\n\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nSo, for 225 grams:\n\nz1 = (225 - 250) / 25 = -25 / 25 = -1\n\nAnd for 275 grams:\n\nz2 = (275 - 250) / 25 = 25 / 25 = 1\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that z is between -1 and 1. In other words, P(-1 < z < 1).\n\nI know that the area under the standard normal curve between z = -1 and z = 1 is approximately 0.6827, which is about 68.27%.\n\nThis matches the 68-95-99.7 rule I mentioned earlier. So, it seems like the probability is approximately 68%.\n\nBut let me see if there's a more precise way to calculate this. Maybe using a z-table or a calculator.\n\nIf I look up the z-scores in a standard normal distribution table, for z = 1, the cumulative probability is approximately 0.8413, and for z = -1, it's approximately 0.1587.\n\nTo find the probability between z = -1 and z = 1, I subtract the lower z-score probability from the higher one:\n\nP(-1 < z < 1) = P(z < 1) - P(z < -1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826, or 68.26%.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier approximation. The probability is approximately 68.26%.\n\nBut the problem says \"approximate probability,\" and given that the 68-95-99.7 rule is a commonly used approximation, I think it's acceptable to say that the probability is approximately 68%.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other factors I should account for. Is the distribution perfectly normal? Are there any constraints or outliers that might affect this probability? Based on the information given, it seems like the weights are perfectly normally distributed with no additional constraints, so the calculation should hold.\n\nAlso, since the standard deviation is given as 25 grams, and the mean is 250 grams, and the intervals are exactly one standard deviation away from the mean, the 68-95-99.7 rule should apply directly.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the approximate probability is 68%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.68} \\]"
