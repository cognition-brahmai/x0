        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know there are 800 students in total in the school, and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. That means for every 3 boys, there are 5 girls.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio is a comparison of quantities. In this case, it's comparing the number of boys to the number of girls. So, if there are 3 boys for every 5 girls, the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 5 = 8 parts.\n\nNow, these 8 parts represent the total number of students, which is 800. So, each part must represent an equal number of students. To find out how many students each part represents, I can divide the total number of students by the total number of parts.\n\nSo, students per part = total students / total parts = 800 / 8.\n\nLet me calculate that: 800 divided by 8 is 100. So, each part represents 100 students.\n\nNow, since there are 3 parts for boys, the number of boys will be 3 parts times 100 students per part, which is 3 * 100 = 300 boys.\n\nSimilarly, for girls, there are 5 parts, so the number of girls will be 5 parts times 100 students per part, which is 5 * 100 = 500 girls.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 300 boys and 500 girls, the total is 300 + 500 = 800 students, which matches the total given. Also, the ratio of boys to girls is 300:500, which simplifies to 3:5 when divided by 100, so that checks out too.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of fractions. Since the total parts are 8, the fraction of the school that are boys is 3/8, and the fraction that are girls is 5/8.\n\nSo, the number of boys would be 3/8 of 800, and the number of girls would be 5/8 of 800.\n\nLet me calculate that to confirm.\n\nBoys: (3/8) * 800 = (3 * 800) / 8 = 2400 / 8 = 300.\n\nGirls: (5/8) * 800 = (5 * 800) / 8 = 4000 / 8 = 500.\n\nAgain, I get the same numbers: 300 boys and 500 girls.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up equations. Let\u2019s say the number of boys is b and the number of girls is g. We know that b + g = 800, and b/g = 3/5.\n\nFrom the ratio, b/g = 3/5, which means b = (3/5)g.\n\nNow, substitute b in the first equation: (3/5)g + g = 800.\n\nCombining terms: (3/5)g + (5/5)g = (8/5)g = 800.\n\nNow, solve for g: g = 800 * (5/8) = 500.\n\nThen, b = 800 - 500 = 300.\n\nAgain, the same result: 300 boys and 500 girls.\n\nI think that\u2019s consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that\u2019s the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let\u2019s see if the ratio 300:500 simplifies to 3:5.\n\nDivide both numbers by 100: 300/100 = 3, and 500/100 = 5, so yes, it\u2019s 3:5.\n\nAlso, the total is 300 + 500 = 800, which matches the total number of students.\n\nI think this is straightforward. Ratios can sometimes be tricky, but breaking it down into parts makes it easier to understand.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 300 boys and 500 girls in the school.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300 \\text{ boys and } 500 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
