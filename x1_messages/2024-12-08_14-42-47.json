        "content": "So I have this problem here: There's a square with a side length of 4 inches, and if you cut it into four equal smaller squares, what's the side length of each smaller square? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. I have a big square, and I'm supposed to cut it into four smaller squares that are all equal. So, probably, I'm dividing the big square into four smaller squares of the same size.\n\nAlright, the big square has a side length of 4 inches. If I cut it into four equal smaller squares, I'm probably dividing each side of the big square into two equal parts because 2 times 2 is 4, right? So, each side of the big square would be divided into two parts of equal length.\n\nSo, if the big square's side is 4 inches, and I divide it into two equal parts, each part would be 4 divided by 2, which is 2 inches.\n\nWait, but then, if each smaller square has sides of 2 inches, then each smaller square would have an area of 2 inches times 2 inches, which is 4 square inches.\n\nBut, the big square has an area of 4 inches times 4 inches, which is 16 square inches. If I divide it into four smaller squares, each should have an area of 16 divided by 4, which is 4 square inches. So, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the side lengths. If the big square has a side length of 4 inches, and I'm creating four smaller squares, I'm essentially halving both the length and the width.\n\nSo, 4 inches divided by 2 is 2 inches for each smaller square's side.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I have a square that's 4 inches by 4 inches, and I cut it in half horizontally and in half vertically, I end up with four smaller squares, each with sides of 2 inches.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to cut it into four equal smaller squares with different side lengths, but I think the most straightforward way is to divide each side into two equal parts.\n\nIs there any other way to cut a square into four equal smaller squares? Hmm, I can't think of another way right now. If I try to cut it differently, I might not end up with squares.\n\nFor example, if I cut the square into four rectangles, but then they wouldn't be squares unless they're squared rectangles, which would be squares again.\n\nSo, I think the only way to cut a square into four equal smaller squares is by dividing each side into two equal parts and then connecting those points.\n\nTherefore, the side length of each smaller square is 2 inches.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If I have a square of side 4 inches, and I divide it into four smaller squares, each smaller square should have half the side length, which is 2 inches.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the area approach. The area of the big square is 16 square inches. Each smaller square has an area of 4 square inches. The side length would be the square root of the area, which is square root of 4, which is 2 inches.\n\nThat confirms it.\n\nSo, the side length of each smaller square is 2 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
