        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two candidates, A and B, who received 60% and 40% of the votes, respectively. Candidate A won by 3000 votes. We need to find the total number of votes cast in the election.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for candidate A to win by 3000 votes. This means that candidate A received 3000 more votes than candidate B.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of votes cast as V.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n- Candidate A received 60% of V, which is 0.6V.\n\n- Candidate B received 40% of V, which is 0.4V.\n\nThe difference between A's and B's votes is 3000 votes:\n\n0.6V - 0.4V = 3000\n\nSo, 0.2V = 3000\n\nNow, to find V, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.2:\n\nV = 3000 / 0.2\n\nV = 15,000\n\nTherefore, the total number of votes cast in the election was 15,000.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIf V = 15,000:\n\n- A received 60% of 15,000 = 9,000 votes\n\n- B received 40% of 15,000 = 6,000 votes\n\nThe difference is 9,000 - 6,000 = 3,000 votes, which matches the information given in the problem.\n\nSo, our answer seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15000} \\]"
