        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A in 4 hours. First, I need to find out how many units it produces per hour. So, if it produces 500 units in 4 hours, then per hour it would produce 500 divided by 4, which is 125 units per hour.\n\nNow, the factory operates for 10 hours per day. So, if it produces 125 units each hour, in 10 hours it would produce 125 multiplied by 10, which is 1,250 units per day.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many units it produces in one week. Assuming a week has 7 days, I would multiply the daily production by 7. So, 1,250 units per day times 7 days equals 8,750 units per week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If it's 125 units per hour and it works 10 hours a day, that's 1,250 per day. Over 7 days, that would indeed be 8,750 units.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any breaks or downtime in those 10 hours. The question doesn't mention any breaks, so I'll assume it's continuous production during operating hours.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the factory operates for 10 hours per day, but it doesn't specify the number of days in a week it operates. The question says \"in one week,\" so I'll assume it operates every day of the week unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, my final answer is 8,750 units per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8750} \\]"
