        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units per day with a defect rate of 2%. We need to find out how many defective units are expected in a month with 30 days.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many units are produced in a month. Since the factory produces 500 units per day and there are 30 days in the month, the total production would be:\n\n500 units/day * 30 days = 15,000 units\n\nNow, with a defect rate of 2%, we can calculate the expected number of defective units by multiplying the total production by the defect rate:\n\n15,000 units * 2% = 15,000 units * 0.02 = 300 units\n\nSo, approximately 300 defective units can be expected in a month.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this again. Is there a better way to calculate this?\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the expected number of defective units per day and then multiply by the number of days in the month.\n\nDefective units per day = 500 units/day * 2% = 500 * 0.02 = 10 units/day\n\nThen, for 30 days:\n\n10 units/day * 30 days = 300 units\n\nThis matches the previous calculation, so it seems consistent.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is an expected value. In reality, the number of defective units can vary due to randomness in the production process. But on average, over many months, the number should be around 300.\n\nAlso, assuming that the production rate and defect rate remain constant throughout the month, which might not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Factors like machine maintenance, worker fatigue, or material quality can affect both production rate and defect rate.\n\nBut based on the information provided, the expected number of defective units in a 30-day month is 300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
