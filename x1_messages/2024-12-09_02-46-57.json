        "content": "Let's see. The water tank has a total capacity of 10,000 liters. It takes 5 minutes to fill the tank using a hose that has a flow rate of 50 liters per minute. We need to find out how much water was already in the tank before we started filling it.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much water is being added to the tank during those 5 minutes. Since the hose delivers 50 liters every minute, in 5 minutes it would deliver:\n\n50 liters/minute * 5 minutes = 250 liters\n\nSo, 250 liters of water are added to the tank in 5 minutes.\n\nNow, the tank's total capacity is 10,000 liters. If we added 250 liters to reach full capacity, then the amount of water that was already in the tank before filling would be:\n\nTotal capacity - water added = initial water in the tank\n\n10,000 liters - 250 liters = 9,750 liters\n\nTherefore, there were 9,750 liters of water in the tank before we started filling it.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the tank already had 9,750 liters and we added 250 liters, that would indeed bring it up to 10,000 liters, which is full. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the tank was being filled from some initial level to full in 5 minutes at 50 liters per minute. So, the difference between the initial level and the full capacity is equal to the amount of water added, which is 250 liters. Therefore, initial water = total capacity - water added, which again gives 10,000 - 250 = 9,750 liters.\n\nI think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we might have missed. For example, is there any leakage or other ways water could be exiting the tank? The problem doesn't mention any, so we can assume that the only change in water volume is due to the hose filling it.\n\nAlso, we should make sure that the units are consistent. The capacity is in liters, and the flow rate is in liters per minute, so everything matches up nicely.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the flow rate is constant. The problem states that the hose has a flow rate of 50 liters per minute, so we can assume it's constant during the filling period.\n\nSo, overall, I believe 9,750 liters is the correct amount of water that was already in the tank before filling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9750 \\text{ liters}} \\]"
