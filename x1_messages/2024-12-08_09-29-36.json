        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says that the original length is 10 meters and the width is 8 meters. Then, it tells me to increase the length by 50% and decrease the width by 25%, and I need to find out what the new area will be after these changes.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, the original area would be 10 meters times 8 meters, which is 80 square meters. But, the dimensions are changing, so I need to find the new length and new width first, and then multiply those together to get the new area.\n\nLet's tackle the length first. The original length is 10 meters, and I need to increase it by 50%. Increasing something by 50% means adding half of its original value to itself. So, half of 10 meters is 5 meters. Therefore, the new length would be 10 meters plus 5 meters, which is 15 meters.\n\nNow, for the width. The original width is 8 meters, and I need to decrease it by 25%. Decreasing something by 25% means subtracting a quarter of its original value from itself. So, a quarter of 8 meters is 2 meters. Therefore, the new width would be 8 meters minus 2 meters, which is 6 meters.\n\nAlright, now that I have the new length and width, I can find the new area. New length is 15 meters, new width is 6 meters. So, multiplying those together: 15 meters times 6 meters equals 90 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, that seems higher than the original area of 80 square meters. Is that possible? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, original length is 10 meters, increase by 50%: 10 meters plus 50% of 10 meters, which is 5 meters, so 15 meters. That seems correct.\n\nOriginal width is 8 meters, decrease by 25%: 8 meters minus 25% of 8 meters, which is 2 meters, so 6 meters. That also seems correct.\n\nNow, area is length times width: 15 meters times 6 meters equals 90 square meters. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages. The length is increased by 50%, which is the same as multiplying by 1.5, and the width is decreased by 25%, which is the same as multiplying by 0.75. So, the new area would be original area times 1.5 times 0.75.\n\nOriginal area is 80 square meters. So, 80 times 1.5 is 120, and 120 times 0.75 is 90 square meters. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the new area is 90 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
