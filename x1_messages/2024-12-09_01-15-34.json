        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses, and each house has a number of light bulbs equal to their house number. So, house number 1 has 1 bulb, house 2 has 2 bulbs, and so on up to house 100 with 100 bulbs.\n\nNow, if every odd-numbered house turns off all their light bulbs, I need to find out how many bulbs will be turned off in total.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which houses are odd-numbered. Odd numbers are like 1, 3, 5, and so on, up to 99. So, houses 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 will turn off all their bulbs.\n\nTo find out how many houses are odd-numbered, I can divide the total number of houses by 2. Since there are 100 houses, there should be 50 odd-numbered houses and 50 even-numbered houses.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Starting from house 1 to house 100:\n\n- House 1: odd\n\n- House 2: even\n\n- House 3: odd\n\n- House 4: even\n\n- ...\n\n- House 99: odd\n\n- House 100: even\n\nSo, indeed, there are 50 odd-numbered houses.\n\nNow, each odd-numbered house turns off all their bulbs. So, the total number of bulbs turned off will be the sum of the bulbs in all odd-numbered houses.\n\nLet\u2019s think about how to calculate that sum.\n\nThe houses are numbered from 1 to 100, and the odd-numbered houses are 1, 3, 5, ..., 99.\n\nThe number of bulbs in each of these houses is equal to their house number. So, house 1 has 1 bulb, house 3 has 3 bulbs, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of bulbs turned off is the sum of the first 50 odd numbers, since there are 50 odd-numbered houses.\n\nI recall that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2. Let me confirm that.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Sum of first 1 odd number: 1 = 1\u00b2\n\n- Sum of first 2 odd numbers: 1 + 3 = 4 = 2\u00b2\n\n- Sum of first 3 odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3\u00b2\n\n- And so on.\n\nSo, the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first 50 odd numbers is 50\u00b2.\n\n50\u00b2 is 2500.\n\nSo, the total number of bulbs turned off is 2500.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense?\n\nLet me verify with a smaller number of houses to ensure the logic is correct.\n\nSuppose there are only 4 houses:\n\n- House 1: 1 bulb (odd, turns off 1 bulb)\n\n- House 2: 2 bulbs (even, bulbs remain on)\n\n- House 3: 3 bulbs (odd, turns off 3 bulbs)\n\n- House 4: 4 bulbs (even, bulbs remain on)\n\nTotal bulbs turned off: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2\u00b2, where n=2 (first 2 odd numbers).\n\nSimilarly, for 6 houses:\n\n- House 1: 1 bulb (off)\n\n- House 2: 2 bulbs (on)\n\n- House 3: 3 bulbs (off)\n\n- House 4: 4 bulbs (on)\n\n- House 5: 5 bulbs (off)\n\n- House 6: 6 bulbs (on)\n\nTotal bulbs turned off: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3\u00b2, where n=3.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, for 100 houses with 50 odd-numbered houses, the sum of the first 50 odd numbers is 50\u00b2 = 2500.\n\nSo, the total number of bulbs turned off is 2500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2500} \\]"
