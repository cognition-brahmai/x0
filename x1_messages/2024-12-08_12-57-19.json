        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 30 students, and there are twice as many girls as boys. That means the number of girls is double the number of boys. Let's use some variables to represent this.\n\nLet\u2019s say the number of boys is B, and the number of girls is G. According to the problem, G = 2B, because there are twice as many girls as boys.\n\nAlso, the total number of students is 30, so B + G = 30.\n\nNow, since G = 2B, we can substitute that into the total:\n\nB + 2B = 30\n\nThat simplifies to 3B = 30\n\nSo, B = 10\n\nNow, since G = 2B, G = 2 * 10 = 20\n\nAlright, so there are 10 boys and 20 girls in the class.\n\nNext, the problem says that 10% of the girls wear glasses, and 20% of the boys wear glasses. We need to find out how many students in total wear glasses.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many girls wear glasses.\n\n10% of 20 girls wear glasses.\n\n10% of 20 is 0.10 * 20 = 2\n\nSo, 2 girls wear glasses.\n\nNow, let's find out how many boys wear glasses.\n\n20% of 10 boys wear glasses.\n\n20% of 10 is 0.20 * 10 = 2\n\nSo, 2 boys wear glasses.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who wear glasses, we add the number of girls and boys who wear glasses:\n\n2 (girls) + 2 (boys) = 4\n\nTherefore, 4 students in total wear glasses.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWe have 30 students, twice as many girls as boys, so boys should be 10 and girls 20.\n\n10% of 20 girls is 2 girls with glasses.\n\n20% of 10 boys is 2 boys with glasses.\n\nTotal students with glasses: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to calculate the percentages directly.\n\nBut I think my method is straightforward and accurate.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4 students wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
