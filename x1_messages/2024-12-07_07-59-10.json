        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets at a rate of 10 per hour. It operates for 8 hours a day, and 5 days a week. We need to find out how long it will take to produce 2000 widgets.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets the factory produces in one day. Since it produces 10 widgets per hour and operates for 8 hours a day, the daily production would be:\n\n10 widgets/hour * 8 hours/day = 80 widgets/day\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production, I'll multiply the daily production by the number of days it operates per week:\n\n80 widgets/day * 5 days/week = 400 widgets/week\n\nSo, the factory produces 400 widgets each week.\n\nNow, we need to produce 2000 widgets. To find out how many weeks it will take, I'll divide the total number of widgets by the weekly production:\n\n2000 widgets / 400 widgets/week = 5 weeks\n\nTherefore, it will take 5 weeks to produce 2000 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the total production per week and see how many weeks are needed to reach 2000 widgets.\n\nWe already know that the factory produces 400 widgets per week. So, for 5 weeks, it would produce:\n\n400 widgets/week * 5 weeks = 2000 widgets\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the factory operates 5 days a week, and produces 80 widgets per day, then in 5 weeks, the total production would be:\n\n80 widgets/day * 5 days/week * 5 weeks = 2000 widgets\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that it will take 5 weeks to produce 2000 widgets.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, is there any downtime? Do they produce at a different rate at certain times? But based on the information provided, there doesn't seem to be any such factors. The production rate is constant at 10 widgets per hour, and the operating schedule is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5 weeks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ weeks}} \\]"
