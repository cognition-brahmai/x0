The expression is (8 * 2) / (4 - 1)^2.\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n(4 - 1) = 3\n\nNow the expression becomes (8 * 2) / 3^2.\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\nNow it's (8 * 2) / 9\n\nThen, multiplication and division from left to right:\n\n8 * 2 = 16\n\nSo, 16 / 9\n\n16 divided by 9 is approximately 1.777..., or 1 and 7/9.\n\nBut since 16 and 9 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction 16/9 is already in its simplest form.\n\nSo, the final answer is 16/9 or approximately 1.777.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{16}{9}} \\]"
