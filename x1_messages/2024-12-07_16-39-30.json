        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a triangle with side lengths of 8 inches, 15 inches, and 17 inches, and I need to find its area. Hmm, I remember that there are different ways to find the area of a triangle, like using base and height, or using Heron's formula. But I'm not sure which one to use here.\n\nFirst, I should check if this is a right-angled triangle because that would make things easier. I know that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, let's see: 8 squared is 64, 15 squared is 225, and 17 squared is 289. Now, does 64 plus 225 equal 289? Let's add them: 64 plus 225 is 289, which matches 17 squared. So, yes, this is a right-angled triangle with the right angle between the sides of 8 inches and 15 inches.\n\nSince it's a right-angled triangle, I can use the formula for the area of a right-angled triangle, which is one-half times the base times the height. Here, the base and height are the two sides that form the right angle, so that's 8 inches and 15 inches.\n\nSo, area equals one-half times 8 times 15. Let's calculate that: one-half of 8 is 4, and 4 times 15 is 60. So, the area should be 60 square inches.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there's another way to confirm this. Maybe I can use Heron's formula and see if I get the same answer.\n\nHeron's formula says that the area of a triangle is equal to the square root of s times s minus a times s minus b times s minus c, where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, and a, b, c are the side lengths.\n\nFirst, I need to find the semi-perimeter, s. The perimeter is the sum of the sides, which is 8 plus 15 plus 17. That's 8 plus 15 is 23, plus 17 is 40 inches. So, the semi-perimeter s is half of that, which is 20 inches.\n\nNow, applying Heron's formula: area equals the square root of s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c). Plugging in the values: s is 20, s minus a is 20 minus 8 which is 12, s minus b is 20 minus 15 which is 5, and s minus c is 20 minus 17 which is 3.\n\nSo, area equals the square root of 20 times 12 times 5 times 3. Let's multiply those together: 20 times 12 is 240, times 5 is 1200, times 3 is 3600. So, the square root of 3600 is 60.\n\nHey, that matches my earlier calculation! So, the area is indeed 60 square inches.\n\nI think that's the answer, but just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using trigonometry, but since it's a right-angled triangle, I don't think I need to go that route.\n\nAlternatively, I could verify if the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem again to confirm it's a right-angled triangle. As I did earlier, 8 squared plus 15 squared equals 64 plus 225, which is 289, and that's equal to 17 squared. So, yes, it is a right-angled triangle.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The area of the triangle is 60 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
