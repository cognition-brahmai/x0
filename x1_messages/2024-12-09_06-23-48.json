        "content": "So, the problem says that a baker uses 3 eggs for every 2 cakes she bakes. And we need to find out how many eggs she will use if she bakes 10 cakes. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cakes. It says 3 eggs for every 2 cakes. That sounds like a ratio, right? So, the ratio of eggs to cakes is 3:2.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 10 cakes. One way to approach this is to set up a proportion. A proportion is like saying that two ratios are equal. So, if 3 eggs are to 2 cakes as x eggs are to 10 cakes, that can be written as:\n\n3/2 = x/10\n\nOkay, so now I need to solve for x. To do that, I can cross-multiply.\n\n3 * 10 = 2 * x\n\nThat gives me:\n\n30 = 2x\n\nNow, to find x, I can divide both sides by 2.\n\nx = 30 / 2\n\nx = 15\n\nSo, the baker will use 15 eggs if she bakes 10 cakes.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If 3 eggs are used for 2 cakes, then for 10 cakes, which is 5 times more (because 10 divided by 2 is 5), she should use 5 times more eggs. 3 eggs multiplied by 5 is 15 eggs. Yeah, that matches.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find out how many eggs are used per cake and then multiply by the number of cakes. So, if 3 eggs are used for 2 cakes, then per cake it would be 3 divided by 2, which is 1.5 eggs per cake. Then, for 10 cakes, it would be 1.5 eggs/cake times 10 cakes, which is 15 eggs. Same answer.\n\nI could also think about it in terms of multiples. If 2 cakes require 3 eggs, then to find out for 10 cakes, I can see how many sets of 2 cakes are in 10 cakes. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So, there are 5 sets of 2 cakes in 10 cakes. Therefore, she would need 5 sets times 3 eggs per set, which is 15 eggs. Again, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this, I end up with 15 eggs. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe if there are some eggs left over or something, but the problem seems straightforward. It's a direct proportion between eggs and cakes.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the baker can bake cakes without using partial eggs, but the calculation shows a whole number, so that's not an issue here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the baker will use 15 eggs to bake 10 cakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
