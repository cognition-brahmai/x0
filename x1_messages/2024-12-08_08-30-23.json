        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells apples on Friday and Saturday. The store sells 20% more apples on Saturday than on Friday, and the total number of apples sold over these two days is 600. We need to find out how many apples were sold on each day.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"20% more\" means. If the store sells a certain number of apples on Friday, then on Saturday, it sells that number plus an additional 20% of that number. For example, if they sold 100 apples on Friday, then on Saturday, they would sell 100 plus 20% of 100, which is 120 apples.\n\nBut since we don't know the exact number sold on Friday, let's use a variable to represent it. Let's say the number of apples sold on Friday is F. Then, the number sold on Saturday would be F plus 20% of F, which is F + 0.2F, or 1.2F.\n\nNow, the total apples sold over the two days is the sum of the apples sold on Friday and Saturday, which is F + 1.2F, or 2.2F. According to the problem, this total is 600 apples. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n2.2F = 600\n\nTo find F, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2.2:\n\nF = 600 / 2.2\n\nLet me calculate that. 600 divided by 2.2 is the same as 6000 divided by 22, because I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal.\n\n6000 divided by 22 is... let's see, 22 times 272 is 5984, which is close to 6000. Subtracting 5984 from 6000 gives us 16. So, 22 times 272 is 5984, and 22 times 272.272... would be closer to 6000. Wait, actually, 22 times 272.7272... equals 6000.\n\nSo, F is approximately 272.73. But since we're dealing with apples, which are whole items, perhaps it's better to work with exact numbers without decimals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently to avoid decimals. Let's try to think in terms of ratios.\n\nIf the store sells F apples on Friday and 1.2F on Saturday, the ratio of Friday to Saturday sales is F : 1.2F, which simplifies to 1 : 1.2, or multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the decimal, 5 : 6.\n\nSo, for every 5 apples sold on Friday, 6 are sold on Saturday. Therefore, the total parts are 5 + 6 = 11 parts, which equal 600 apples.\n\nSo, each part represents 600 / 11 apples. Let me calculate that: 600 divided by 11 is approximately 54.5454...\n\nTherefore, Friday's sales would be 5 parts: 5 * 54.5454 \u2248 272.73, and Saturday's sales would be 6 parts: 6 * 54.5454 \u2248 327.27.\n\nAgain, we're getting decimal numbers for apples, which doesn't make sense in reality, but perhaps in this context, it's acceptable, or maybe the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my approach. Let's try another method.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of apples sold on Friday as F and on Saturday as S.\n\nWe know that S = F + 0.2F = 1.2F\n\nAnd F + S = 600\n\nSubstituting S from the first equation into the second equation:\n\nF + 1.2F = 600\n\n2.2F = 600\n\nF = 600 / 2.2\n\nAgain, F = 272.73\n\nThen S = 1.2 * 272.73 \u2248 327.27\n\nSo, Friday: 273 apples, Saturday: 327 apples, totaling 600.\n\nWait, but 273 + 327 is 600 exactly. Maybe it's acceptable to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the store can only sell whole numbers of apples, so maybe the exact numbers are 273 and 327.\n\nLet me check:\n\nIf F = 273, then S = 1.2 * 273 = 327.6, which is not a whole number, but if we round it to 328, then F + S = 273 + 328 = 601, which is one more than 600.\n\nAlternatively, if F = 272, then S = 1.2 * 272 = 326.4, which rounds to 326, and F + S = 272 + 326 = 598, which is two less than 600.\n\nHmm, seems like neither option gives us exactly 600 without including decimal apples.\n\nMaybe the problem allows for selling a fraction of an apple, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store sold exactly 272.7272... apples on Friday and 327.2727... on Saturday, but again, that's not practical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that 20% more on Saturday means exactly an additional 20%, and perhaps the total is exactly divisible.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of ratios again.\n\nIf Friday is F and Saturday is 1.2F, and F + 1.2F = 2.2F = 600, then F = 600 / 2.2 = 272.7272...\n\nBut this is giving a repeating decimal, which is not ideal for counting apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the ratio is 5:6, as I did earlier, and accept that each part is 600 / 11, which is approximately 54.5454...\n\nThen, Friday is 5 parts: 5 * 54.5454 \u2248 272.73, and Saturday is 6 parts: 6 * 54.5454 \u2248 327.27.\n\nAgain, this results in decimal numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to express the answer in fractions.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nF = 600 / 2.2 = 6000 / 22 = 3000 / 11 \u2248 272.7272...\n\nSimilarly, S = 1.2 * (3000 / 11) = 3600 / 11 \u2248 327.2727...\n\nSo, in fraction form, F = 3000 / 11 apples, and S = 3600 / 11 apples.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem to get whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up equations with percentages.\n\nLet\u2019s say F is the number of apples sold on Friday.\n\nThen, S = F + 0.2F = 1.2F\n\nAnd F + S = F + 1.2F = 2.2F = 600\n\nSo, F = 600 / 2.2 = 3000 / 11 \u2248 272.73\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that 20% more on Saturday means that Saturday sales are 6/5 times Friday sales, since 1 + 0.2 = 1.2, and 1.2 = 6/5.\n\nSo, S = (6/5) * F\n\nAnd F + S = F + (6/5)F = (11/5)F = 600\n\nSo, F = 600 * (5/11) = 3000 / 11 \u2248 272.73\n\nSame result again.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the exact number of apples sold on Friday is 3000/11, which is approximately 272.73, and on Saturday, it's 3600/11, approximately 327.27.\n\nIf we need to report whole numbers, perhaps the store sold 273 apples on Friday and 327 on Saturday, totaling 600.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider 272 on Friday and 328 on Saturday, that totals 600, but then Saturday sales would be 328/272 \u2248 1.2059, which is slightly more than 20% higher.\n\nSimilarly, 327/273 \u2248 1.1978, which is slightly less than 20%.\n\nSo, neither option gives exactly 20% more on Saturday.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem allows for approximate answers or fractional apples.\n\nIn conclusion, the store sold approximately 272.73 apples on Friday and 327.27 apples on Saturday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{273 \\text{ apples on Friday and } 327 \\text{ apples on Saturday}} \\]"
