        "content": "Mahatma Gandhi was a prominent political and spiritual leader in India who played a pivotal role in the country's struggle for independence from British rule. He is renowned for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, which he termed \"Satyagraha.\" This approach involved civil disobedience and peaceful protests to achieve political and social change. Gandhi's methods not only led to India's independence in 1947 but also inspired numerous civil rights and freedom movements across the globe.\n\nGandhi was tragically assassinated on January 30, 1948. His death was a result of an assassination by Nathuram Godse, a nationalist who opposed Gandhi's policies, particularly his advocacy for peace and unity between Hindus and Muslims during the partition of India and Pakistan."
