        "content": "The orange soil discovered by the Apollo 17 astronauts is rich in tiny volcanic glass beads called \"orange glass.\" These beads are actually small particles of volcanic glass, specifically rich in the mineral ilmenite, which gives them their distinctive orange color. These glass beads were formed from molten rock that was ejected during volcanic eruptions on the Moon and then rapidly cooled, forming these tiny glass beads. They are a fascinating reminder of the Moon's volcanic past."
