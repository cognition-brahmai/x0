        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the tax rates are different for different parts of your income. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **First $10,000:** You pay 10% tax on this portion.\n\n2. **Next $30,000:** That is, from $10,001 to $40,000, you pay 20% tax on this portion.\n\n3. **Anything above $40,000:** You pay 30% tax on that portion.\n\nNow, the person earns $60,000 per year. Let's see how much tax they have to pay.\n\nFirst, let's split the income into the different tax brackets:\n\n- The first $10,000 is taxed at 10%.\n\n- The next $30,000 (from $10,001 to $40,000) is taxed at 20%.\n\n- The remaining $20,000 (since $60,000 - $40,000 = $20,000) is taxed at 30%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the tax for each portion:\n\n1. **First $10,000 at 10%:**\n\n   \\[\n   10,000 \\times 0.10 = 1,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next $30,000 at 20%:**\n\n   \\[\n   30,000 \\times 0.20 = 6,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Remaining $20,000 at 30%:**\n\n   \\[\n   20,000 \\times 0.30 = 6,000\n   \\]\n\nNow, add up all these tax amounts to get the total tax:\n\n\\[\n1,000 + 6,000 + 6,000 = 13,000\n\\]\n\nSo, the person will pay $13,000 in taxes.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst portion: $10,000 at 10% is indeed $1,000.\n\nSecond portion: $30,000 at 20% is $6,000.\n\nThird portion: $20,000 at 30% is $6,000.\n\nAdding them up: $1,000 + $6,000 + $6,000 = $13,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people calculate the tax by applying the highest rate to the entire amount and then adjusting for the lower rates in the lower brackets, but I think the way I did it is straightforward and accurate.\n\nSo, the total tax is $13,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13000} \\]"
