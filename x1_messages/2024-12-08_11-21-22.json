        "content": "Let's see. If someone walks at an average speed of 5 kilometers per hour for 2 hours and 30 minutes, we need to find out how many kilometers they would cover.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the time is in hours because the speed is in kilometers per hour. The time given is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, 2 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 2.5 hours.\n\nNow, the formula to calculate distance is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nGiven that the speed is 5 km/h and the time is 2.5 hours, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDistance = 5 km/h \u00d7 2.5 h\n\nWhen I multiply these, the hours unit cancels out, leaving me with kilometers.\n\nSo, 5 \u00d7 2.5 = 12.5\n\nTherefore, the person would travel 12.5 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If they walk at 5 km/h for 2 hours, that would be 10 km. Then, for the additional 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, at 5 km/h, that would be 2.5 km. So, 10 km plus 2.5 km equals 12.5 km. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the time entirely into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 30 minutes, which totals 150 minutes. Then, the speed is 5 km per 60 minutes. So, to find out how far they travel per minute, I could divide 5 km by 60 minutes, which is approximately 0.0833 km per minute. Then, multiply that by 150 minutes: 0.0833 km/min \u00d7 150 min = 12.5 km. Again, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, the answer is 12.5 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12.5} \\]"
