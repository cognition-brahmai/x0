        "content": "So I have this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 25 feet long and 15 feet wide, and I need to figure out how much fencing I'll need to go all the way around it. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that a rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So, there are two sides that are 25 feet each and two sides that are 15 feet each. To find the total amount of fencing needed, I think I need to add up all four sides.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal fencing = 25 feet + 25 feet + 15 feet + 15 feet\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, let's add those up.\n\n25 + 25 is 50 feet, and 15 + 15 is 30 feet. So, 50 + 30 equals 80 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this? I recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP = 2(25) + 2(15) = 50 + 30 = 80 feet.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier by adding all four sides individually.\n\nIs there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe using the distributive property or something.\n\nHmm, let's see. Since it's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width, that's the same as 2 times (length + width).\n\nSo, P = 2(L + W) = 2(25 + 15) = 2(40) = 80 feet.\n\nAgain, 80 feet. That makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's imagine the garden plot. If it's 25 feet long and 15 feet wide, and I'm fencing around it, I need to cover both lengths and both widths.\n\nSo, starting from one corner, I'd need 25 feet along the length, then 15 feet along the width, then another 25 feet along the next length, and finally 15 feet along the last width to complete the rectangle.\n\nAdding those up again: 25 + 15 + 25 + 15 = 80 feet.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now that 80 feet is the correct amount of fencing needed.\n\nBut, just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there's any waste or extra fencing needed, like for gates or corners, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It just asks for the total feet of fencing around the entire garden.\n\nSo, I think 80 feet is the answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the units. The dimensions are given in feet, and the answer is in feet, so that's consistent.\n\nAlso, ensuring that I didn't make any calculation errors. 25 plus 25 is 50, 15 plus 15 is 30, and 50 plus 30 is 80. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the perimeter formula P = 2L + 2W = 2(25) + 2(15) = 50 + 30 = 80 feet.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 80 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
