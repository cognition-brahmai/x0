        "content": "To determine the pH of a solution, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log[\\text{H}^+] \\]\n\nwhere \\([\\text{H}^+]\\) is the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per liter (M).\n\nGiven that the hydrogen ion concentration is \\(1 \\times 10^{-5}\\) M, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log(1 \\times 10^{-5}) \\]\n\nFirst, let's understand what the logarithm is doing here. The logarithm (log) of a number is the exponent to which another fixed value, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In this case, the base is 10 because it's a common logarithm.\n\nSo, \\(\\log(1 \\times 10^{-5})\\) is asking, \"10 raised to what power equals \\(1 \\times 10^{-5}\\)?\"\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[ 10^{-5} = 0.00001 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\log(10^{-5}) = -5 \\]\n\nNow, plugging this back into the pH formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -(-5) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is 5.\n\nTo further understand this, let's consider the pH scale:\n\n- A pH less than 7 is acidic.\n\n- A pH of 7 is neutral.\n\n- A pH greater than 7 is basic or alkaline.\n\nSince our calculated pH is 5, this indicates that the solution is acidic.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that pH is a logarithmic scale, meaning that each whole number difference represents a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration. For example, a pH of 4 has ten times more hydrogen ions than a pH of 5.\n\nIn this case, a pH of 5 corresponds to a hydrogen ion concentration of \\(1 \\times 10^{-5}\\) M, which is indeed acidic.\n\nSo, to summarize, the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of \\(1 \\times 10^{-5}\\) M is 5, indicating an acidic solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
