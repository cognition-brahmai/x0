        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, I have a 100-foot rope, and I need to cut it into three pieces with some specific relationships between their lengths. The problem says that one piece is twice as long as the second piece, and the third piece is three times as long as the second piece. Okay, so let's try to translate this into some equations.\n\nFirst, I need to define variables for the lengths of the pieces. Let's say:\n\n- Let the length of the second piece be x feet.\n\nThen, according to the problem:\n\n- The first piece is twice as long as the second piece, so it would be 2x feet.\n\n- The third piece is three times as long as the second piece, so that would be 3x feet.\n\nNow, since all three pieces come from the original 100-foot rope, their lengths should add up to 100 feet. So, I can write the equation:\n\n2x + x + 3x = 100\n\nCombining like terms, that's:\n\n6x = 100\n\nNow, to find x, I need to divide both sides by 6:\n\nx = 100 / 6\n\nx = 16.666... feet\n\nHmm, that's a repeating decimal. Maybe there's a better way to express this. Alternatively, I can express it as a fraction:\n\nx = 100 / 6 = 50 / 3 feet\n\nSo, the second piece is 50/3 feet.\n\nNow, the first piece is twice that, so:\n\nFirst piece = 2 * (50/3) = 100/3 feet\n\nAnd the third piece is three times the second piece:\n\nThird piece = 3 * (50/3) = 150/3 = 50 feet\n\nWait a minute, let's check if these add up to 100 feet:\n\n100/3 + 50/3 + 50 = ?\n\nFirst, 100/3 + 50/3 = (100 + 50)/3 = 150/3 = 50 feet\n\nThen, 50 + 50 = 100 feet\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nSo, the lengths of the pieces are:\n\n- First piece: 100/3 feet (which is approximately 33.333... feet)\n\n- Second piece: 50/3 feet (approximately 16.666... feet)\n\n- Third piece: 50 feet\n\nWait a second, I'm a bit confused. The problem says \"one piece is twice as long as the second piece,\" but it doesn't specify which one is twice as long. Maybe I assigned the pieces incorrectly.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"one piece is twice as long as the second piece, and the third piece is three times as long as the second piece.\"\n\nOkay, so it specifies that the first piece is twice the second, and the third is three times the second. So my initial assignment seems correct.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"one piece is twice as long as the second piece\" could refer to any one of the pieces being twice the second piece, but in that case, the problem wouldn't be specific enough. So, I think my initial interpretation is correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the ratios of the pieces.\n\nIf the second piece is x, first is 2x, and third is 3x, so the ratio is 2:1:3.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, that gave me x = 50/3, first piece 100/3, and third piece 50, which adds up to 100, so it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider assigning variables differently to see if I get the same result.\n\nLet me let the second piece be y feet.\n\nThen, first piece is 2y feet, and third piece is 3y feet.\n\nSo, 2y + y + 3y = 100\n\n6y = 100\n\ny = 100/6 = 50/3 feet\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, first piece is 2*(50/3) = 100/3 feet\n\nSecond piece is 50/3 feet\n\nThird piece is 3*(50/3) = 50 feet\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of multiples.\n\nLet\u2019s say the second piece is 1 part, then the first is 2 parts, and the third is 3 parts.\n\nSo total parts are 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 parts.\n\nTotal length is 100 feet, so each part is 100/6 = 50/3 feet.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Second piece: 1 part = 50/3 feet\n\n- First piece: 2 parts = 100/3 feet\n\n- Third piece: 3 parts = 150/3 = 50 feet\n\nAgain, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using different variables.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the lengths as a, b, and c, where b is the second piece.\n\nSo, a = 2b\n\nAnd c = 3b\n\nAnd a + b + c = 100\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2b + b + 3b = 100\n\n6b = 100\n\nb = 50/3 feet\n\nThen a = 2*(50/3) = 100/3 feet\n\nc = 3*(50/3) = 50 feet\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using algebra with different variable assignments.\n\nLet\u2019s say the first piece is x, the second is y, and the third is z.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y + z = 100\n\nAnd x = 2y\n\nAnd z = 3y\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n2y + y + 3y = 100\n\n6y = 100\n\ny = 50/3 feet\n\nThen x = 2*(50/3) = 100/3 feet\n\nz = 3*(50/3) = 50 feet\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nMaybe I can try to solve it using simultaneous equations.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y + z = 100\n\nx - 2y = 0 (since x = 2y)\n\nz - 3y = 0 (since z = 3y)\n\nSo, system of equations:\n\n1) x + y + z = 100\n\n2) x - 2y = 0\n\n3) z - 3y = 0\n\nFrom equation 2, x = 2y\n\nFrom equation 3, z = 3y\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n2y + y + 3y = 100\n\n6y = 100\n\ny = 50/3 feet\n\nThen x = 2*(50/3) = 100/3 feet\n\nz = 3*(50/3) = 50 feet\n\nSame result yet again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution method.\n\nFrom x = 2y and z = 3y, substitute into x + y + z = 100:\n\n2y + y + 3y = 100\n\n6y = 100\n\ny = 50/3 feet\n\nThen x = 100/3 feet, z = 50 feet\n\nConsistent with previous results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using elimination method.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y + z = 100\n\nx - 2y = 0\n\nz - 3y = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, x = 2y\n\nFrom the third equation, z = 3y\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n2y + y + 3y = 100\n\n6y = 100\n\ny = 50/3 feet\n\nThen x = 100/3 feet, z = 50 feet\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the lengths in terms of the smallest piece.\n\nThe second piece is the smallest, being x, while first is 2x and third is 3x.\n\nTotal is 6x = 100\n\nSo x = 100/6 = 50/3 feet\n\nThen first piece is 2*(50/3) = 100/3 feet\n\nThird piece is 3*(50/3) = 50 feet\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the difference in lengths.\n\nBut that might complicate things unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using proportion.\n\nThe pieces are in the ratio 2:1:3.\n\nTotal parts = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 parts\n\nEach part = 100 / 6 = 50/3 feet\n\nThen:\n\n- Second piece: 1 part = 50/3 feet\n\n- First piece: 2 parts = 100/3 feet\n\n- Third piece: 3 parts = 50 feet\n\nSame as earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using fractions.\n\nThe second piece is 1/6 of the total length, since total parts are 6.\n\nSo, second piece = (1/6)*100 = 100/6 = 50/3 feet\n\nFirst piece = 2/6 of total length = (2/6)*100 = 200/6 = 100/3 feet\n\nThird piece = 3/6 of total length = (3/6)*100 = 150/3 = 50 feet\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using decimals for verification.\n\nx = 50/3 \u2248 16.666... feet\n\nFirst piece = 2x \u2248 33.333... feet\n\nThird piece = 3x \u2248 50 feet\n\nAdding them up: 16.666... + 33.333... + 50 = 100 feet\n\nChecks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the problem in terms of multiples.\n\nIf the second piece is x, then first is 2x, third is 3x, total is 6x = 100 \u21d2 x = 100/6 = 50/3 feet\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps solving it using matrix method.\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\nx + y + z = 100\n\nx - 2y = 0\n\nz - 3y = 0\n\nIn matrix form:\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\nPerform row operations to solve for x, y, z.\n\nFirst, swap row 1 and row 2:\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\nNow, subtract row 1 from row 2:\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 3 1 | 100]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\nNow, swap row 2 and row 3:\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\n[0 3 1 | 100]\n\nNow, subtract 3*row 2 from row 3:\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\n[0 0 10 | 100]\n\nSo, 10z = 100 \u21d2 z = 10 feet\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier calculations gave z = 50 feet.\n\nMust have made a mistake in the row operations.\n\nWait, if z = 10, then from row 2: y - 3z = 0 \u21d2 y - 30 = 0 \u21d2 y = 30 feet\n\nThen from row 1: x - 2y = 0 \u21d2 x - 60 = 0 \u21d2 x = 60 feet\n\nNow, check if x + y + z = 60 + 30 + 10 = 100 feet, which checks out.\n\nBut according to earlier methods, z should be 50 feet. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, I must have messed up the matrix setup.\n\nLet me double-check the matrix representation.\n\nThe system is:\n\nx + y + z = 100\n\nx - 2y = 0\n\nz - 3y = 0\n\nSo, augmented matrix:\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\nPerform row operations.\n\nFirst, subtract row 1 from row 2:\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\n[0 -3 -1 | -100]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\nNow, multiply row 2 by -1/3:\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\n[0 1 1/3 | 100/3]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\nNow, subtract row 2 from row 3:\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\n[0 1 1/3 | 100/3]\n\n[0 0 -10/3 | -100/3]\n\nMultiply row 3 by -3/10:\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\n[0 1 1/3 | 100/3]\n\n[0 0 1 | 10]\n\nNow, substitute back.\n\nFrom row 3: z = 10 feet\n\nFrom row 2: y + (1/3)z = 100/3 \u21d2 y + 10/3 = 100/3 \u21d2 y = 100/3 - 10/3 = 90/3 = 30 feet\n\nFrom row 1: x + y + z = 100 \u21d2 x + 30 + 10 = 100 \u21d2 x = 60 feet\n\nSo, according to this, x = 60 feet, y = 30 feet, z = 10 feet\n\nBut according to earlier methods, x = 100/3 \u2248 33.333 feet, y = 50/3 \u2248 16.666 feet, z = 50 feet\n\nThere's a contradiction here. I must have set up the matrix incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the equations.\n\nGiven:\n\nx = 2y\n\nz = 3y\n\nAnd x + y + z = 100\n\nSo, in terms of y:\n\n2y + y + 3y = 100 \u21d2 6y = 100 \u21d2 y = 50/3 feet\n\nThen x = 2*(50/3) = 100/3 feet\n\nz = 3*(50/3) = 50 feet\n\nBut according to the matrix method, I got x = 60, y = 30, z = 10, which also adds up to 100, but doesn't satisfy x = 2y and z = 3y, because 60 \u2260 2*30 and 10 \u2260 3*30.\n\nWait, that's not right. 60 = 2*30, actually, but 10 \u2260 3*30. So it doesn't satisfy z = 3y.\n\nI must have set up the matrix wrong.\n\nWait, in the matrix, the third equation is z - 3y = 0, which is correct for z = 3y.\n\nBut in the matrix solution, z = 10 and y = 30, which doesn't satisfy z = 3y because 10 \u2260 3*30.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in the matrix operations.\n\nLet me redo the matrix method carefully.\n\nStarting with:\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\nSubtract row 1 from row 2:\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\n[0 -3 -1 | -100]\n\n[0 1 -3 | 0]\n\nNow, add (1/3) of row 2 to row 3 to eliminate y from row 3:\n\nRow 3: [0 1 -3 | 0] + (1/3)[0 -3 -1 | -100] = [0 1 -3 | 0] + [0 -1 -1/3 | -100/3] = [0 0 -10/3 | -100/3]\n\nNow, multiply row 3 by -3/10:\n\n[0 0 1 | 10]\n\nSo, z = 10 feet\n\nNow, from row 2: -3y - z = -100 \u21d2 -3y - 10 = -100 \u21d2 -3y = -90 \u21d2 y = 30 feet\n\nFrom row 1: x + y + z = 100 \u21d2 x + 30 + 10 = 100 \u21d2 x = 60 feet\n\nBut according to the earlier methods, y should be 50/3 \u2248 16.666 feet, not 30 feet.\n\nThere's clearly a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the interpretation of \"one piece is twice as long as the second piece.\"\n\nMaybe I misassigned which piece is which.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"one piece is twice as long as the second piece, and the third piece is three times as long as the second piece.\"\n\nSo, if I denote the second piece as y, then the first piece is 2y, and the third piece is 3y.\n\nBut according to the matrix method, I got y = 30, x = 60, z = 10, which doesn't satisfy x = 2y and z = 3y, because 60 \u2260 2*30 and 10 \u2260 3*30.\n\nWait, 60 = 2*30, actually, but 10 \u2260 3*30. So z = 3y would be z = 90, but in this solution z = 10.\n\nThat means the matrix method is inconsistent with the other methods.\n\nI must have set up the matrix incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I miswrote the equations.\n\nGiven:\n\nx = 2y\n\nz = 3y\n\nAnd x + y + z = 100\n\nSo, substituting into the sum:\n\n2y + y + 3y = 100 \u21d2 6y = 100 \u21d2 y = 50/3\n\nThen x = 2*(50/3) = 100/3\n\nz = 3*(50/3) = 50\n\nBut in the matrix method, I got y = 30, x = 60, z = 10, which satisfies x = 2y (60 = 2*30), but not z = 3y (10 \u2260 3*30).\n\nSo, there must be an error in the matrix setup or solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the system differently.\n\nGiven:\n\nx = 2y\n\nz = 3y\n\nx + y + z = 100\n\nSo, in equation form:\n\n1) x - 2y = 0\n\n2) z - 3y = 0\n\n3) x + y + z = 100\n\nIn matrix form:\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 0 1 | 0]\n\n[1 1 1 | 100]\n\nNow, perform row operations.\n\nSubtract row 1 from row 3:\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 0 1 | 0]\n\n[0 3 1 | 100]\n\nNow, swap row 2 and row 3:\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 3 1 | 100]\n\n[0 0 1 | 0]\n\nNow, subtract row 3 from row 2:\n\n[1 -2 0 | 0]\n\n[0 3 0 | 100]\n\n[0 0 1 | 0]\n\nSo, from row 3: z = 0\n\nFrom row 2: 3y = 100 \u21d2 y = 100/3 feet\n\nFrom row 1: x - 2y = 0 \u21d2 x = 2*(100/3) = 200/3 feet\n\nNow, check the sum: x + y + z = 200/3 + 100/3 + 0 = 300/3 = 100 feet\n\nBut according to the problem, z should be 3y, which would be 3*(100/3) = 100 feet, but here z = 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nClearly, there's a mistake in setting up the matrix.\n\nI think the issue is that I have two equations involving x and y, and y and z, and one sum equation.\n\nPerhaps I need to set it up differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express x and z in terms of y and substitute into the sum equation.\n\nAs done earlier:\n\nx = 2y\n\nz = 3y\n\nThen x + y + z = 2y + y + 3y = 6y = 100 \u21d2 y = 50/3\n\nThen x = 100/3, z = 50\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix method is not the best approach for this problem.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the simpler substitution or algebraic methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the pieces are cut in a specific order.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the order of cutting, so it's probably not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the pieces must be of certain minimum lengths, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the rope cannot be cut into fractional lengths, but in reality, ropes can be cut into any length, including fractions.\n\nBut in this case, since the total length is 100 feet and the ratios are 2:1:3, the lengths come out to fractions, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there is a way to avoid fractions.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, it's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nBut assuming the problem is correctly stated, the solution should be as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if \"second piece\" refers to a specific piece, or if the pieces are being arbitrarily labeled.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"second piece,\" so it's probably referring to one of the pieces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider assigning variables differently.\n\nLet me try letting the second piece be x, then first piece is 2x, third piece is 3x, total is 6x = 100 \u21d2 x = 50/3\n\nThen first piece is 100/3, second is 50/3, third is 50 feet.\n\nThis seems consistent across multiple methods, except for the matrix method, which I must have messed up.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the lengths are:\n\nFirst piece: 100/3 feet \u2248 33.333 feet\n\nSecond piece: 50/3 feet \u2248 16.666 feet\n\nThird piece: 50 feet\n\nBut now I'm thinking, does this make sense?\n\nWait a minute, if the third piece is 50 feet and the first piece is only about 33.333 feet, and the second is about 16.666 feet, is that consistent with the original statement?\n\nThe original statement says one piece is twice as long as the second piece, and the third piece is three times as long as the second piece.\n\nSo, if second piece is x = 50/3 \u2248 16.666 feet\n\nThen first piece is 2x \u2248 33.333 feet\n\nThird piece is 3x = 50 feet\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the ratios again.\n\nThe ratios are first:second:third = 2:1:3\n\nSo, total parts are 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 parts\n\nEach part is 100 / 6 = 50/3 feet\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Second piece: 1 part = 50/3 feet\n\n- First piece: 2 parts = 100/3 feet\n\n- Third piece: 3 parts = 150/3 = 50 feet\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the third piece being 50 feet is actually the longest piece, which makes sense because it's three times the second piece.\n\nSo, if second piece is x = 50/3 \u2248 16.666 feet, then third piece is 3x = 50 feet, which is longer than the first piece, which is 2x \u2248 33.333 feet.\n\nThat seems logically consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there is another way to interpret \"one piece is twice as long as the second piece.\"\n\nMaybe \"one piece\" refers to the third piece, and \"second piece\" refers to the second piece.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"one piece is twice as long as the second piece,\" which I interpreted as first piece = 2 * second piece.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"one piece is twice as long as the second piece\" could refer to the third piece being twice the second piece, but the problem also says \"the third piece is three times as long as the second piece,\" which contradicts that.\n\nTherefore, my initial interpretation must be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, but assuming it's correct as stated, the solution stands.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider units.\n\nAll measurements are in feet, so no conversion is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if the rope has to be cut into integer lengths, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nTherefore, the solution with fractional lengths is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there are any constraints on the lengths, such as minimum or maximum lengths, but the problem doesn't specify any.\n\nTherefore, the solution is valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if the pieces need to be of different lengths, but according to the problem, one is twice the second, and third is three times the second, so they are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there is a way to express the lengths without fractions.\n\nFor example, 100/3 feet can be expressed as 33 feet and 1/3 foot, which is 33 feet 4 inches, since 1/3 foot = 4 inches.\n\nSimilarly, 50/3 feet is 16 feet and 2/3 foot, which is 16 feet 8 inches.\n\nAnd 50 feet is just 50 feet.\n\nSo, the pieces would be approximately 33 feet 4 inches, 16 feet 8 inches, and 50 feet.\n\nBut since the problem uses feet, and fractions are acceptable, the exact lengths are 100/3 feet, 50/3 feet, and 50 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if the sum of these pieces indeed equals 100 feet.\n\n100/3 + 50/3 + 50 = (100 + 50)/3 + 50 = 150/3 + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 feet\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there is a different way to approach this problem, such as using proportions or percentages.\n\nFor example, the second piece is 1/6 of the total length, since total parts are 6.\n\nSo, second piece is (1/6)*100 = 50/3 feet\n\nFirst piece is 2/6 = 1/3 of the total length, which is (1/3)*100 = 100/3 feet\n\nThird piece is 3/6 = 1/2 of the total length, which is (1/2)*100 = 50 feet\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider using cross-multiplication or other methods, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there is a way to set up the problem using only one variable.\n\nYes, as I did earlier, by letting the second piece be x, then expressing the others in terms of x.\n\nThat seems efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider using ratios and proportions.\n\nAs above, the ratio is 2:1:3, total parts 6, each part 50/3 feet.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if the problem can be solved using guess and check.\n\nFor example, assume the second piece is 10 feet, then first piece is 20 feet, third piece is 30 feet, total is 60 feet, which is less than 100.\n\nSo, need to increase the second piece.\n\nTry second piece as 20 feet: first is 40 feet, third is 60 feet, total is 120 feet, which is more than 100.\n\nSo, the second piece is between 10 and 20 feet.\n\nTry 15 feet: first is 30 feet, third is 45 feet, total is 90 feet, still less than 100.\n\nTry 16 feet: first is 32 feet, third is 48 feet, total is 96 feet, still less.\n\nTry 16.5 feet: first is 33 feet, third is 49.5 feet, total is 99 feet, still less.\n\nTry 16.666 feet: first is 33.332 feet, third is 50 feet, total is 100 feet.\n\nWhich matches the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider using a graphical method, plotting the relationships, but that might be too time-consuming and not practical for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there is a formula for this type of problem.\n\nIn general, for problems involving ratios and proportions, the method of assigning variables and setting up equations, as I did, is standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider dimensional analysis, but it's not directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider using weights or masses instead of lengths, but the principle would be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there is a way to use similar triangles or other geometric concepts, but that seems unrelated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if this is a system of linear equations and solve it as such, which I did using the matrix method, but I must have made a mistake in that approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider writing the equations in terms of differences.\n\nFor example, first piece is twice the second piece: x = 2y\n\nThird piece is three times the second piece: z = 3y\n\nAnd x + y + z = 100\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider expressing everything in terms of the smallest piece, which is y, and substitute accordingly.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the problem is straightforward and my initial solution is correct, and any discrepancies are due to errors in alternative methods.\n\nGiven that multiple methods lead to the same conclusion, it's likely that the solution is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if the problem has multiple solutions, but given the constraints, it should have a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if there are any hidden constraints or if the problem allows for negative lengths, which wouldn't make sense.\n\nSince lengths must be positive, and our solution has all positive lengths, it's valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider if the rope can be cut into pieces of zero length, but again, that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nFirst piece: 100/3 feet \u2248 33.333 feet\n\nSecond piece: 50/3 feet \u2248 16.666 feet\n\nThird piece: 50 feet\n\nAnd these lengths satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe lengths of the pieces are \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{100}{3} \\text{ feet}, \\dfrac{50}{3} \\text{ feet}, 50 \\text{ feet}}\\)."
