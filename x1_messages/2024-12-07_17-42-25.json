        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about two trains moving towards each other from different stations. Station A and Station B are 420 miles apart. One train leaves Station A going towards Station B at 60 miles per hour, and the other train leaves Station B going towards Station A at 80 miles per hour. I need to find out how far each train has traveled when they meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the relative speed at which they are approaching each other is 60 mph plus 80 mph, which is 140 mph. That makes sense because the distance between them is decreasing at a rate of 140 miles every hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two stations is 420 miles. If they are moving towards each other at 140 mph, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their combined speed. So, time = distance / speed = 420 miles / 140 mph. Let me calculate that: 420 divided by 140 is 3 hours. So, they will meet after 3 hours.\n\nNext, to find out how far each train has traveled in that time, I can multiply their individual speeds by the time.\n\nFor the train from Station A: 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nFor the train from Station B: 80 mph * 3 hours = 240 miles.\n\nSo, when they meet, the train from Station A would have traveled 180 miles, and the train from Station B would have traveled 240 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check if that adds up to the total distance. 180 miles plus 240 miles is 420 miles, which matches the distance between the stations. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the proportion of the distance each train covers. Since the train from Station A is going slower (60 mph) compared to the train from Station B (80 mph), it makes sense that it would cover less distance than the other train when they meet.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up equations based on the distances each train travels. Let\u2019s say they meet after t hours. Then, the distance covered by the train from Station A is 60t miles, and the distance covered by the train from Station B is 80t miles. Since the sum of these distances should be equal to the total distance between the stations, I can write:\n\n60t + 80t = 420\n\nCombining like terms, that\u2019s 140t = 420\n\nThen, solving for t: t = 420 / 140 = 3 hours, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nThen, plugging t back into the distance equations:\n\nDistance from A: 60 * 3 = 180 miles\n\nDistance from B: 80 * 3 = 240 miles\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nI think that\u2019s the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let\u2019s consider if there\u2019s any other factor I might have missed. For example, are the trains accelerating or decelerating? The problem doesn\u2019t mention any change in speed, so I can assume they are moving at constant speeds.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to note that both trains start at the same time and move towards each other. If one started earlier, that would change the calculation, but in this case, they start simultaneously.\n\nSo, in conclusion, when the two trains meet, the train from Station A would have traveled 180 miles, and the train from Station B would have traveled 240 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180 \\text{ miles and } 240 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
