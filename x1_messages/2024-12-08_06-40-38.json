        "content": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a train's journey. It travels the first 100 miles at 60 mph and then the remaining 150 miles at 80 mph. I need to find out how long the whole journey takes.\n\nOkay, so I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, maybe I can calculate the time for each part of the journey separately and then add them together to get the total time.\n\nFirst, for the first 100 miles at 60 mph:\n\nTime = distance / speed = 100 miles / 60 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that. 100 divided by 60 is... that's 1.666... hours. Maybe it's better to keep it as a fraction. 100/60 simplifies to 10/6, which is 5/3 hours.\n\nAlright, so the first part takes 5/3 hours.\n\nNow, for the second part, 150 miles at 80 mph:\n\nTime = 150 miles / 80 mph = 150/80 hours.\n\nSimplifying that, 150 divided by 80 is the same as 15/8, which is 1.875 hours.\n\nSo, the second part takes 15/8 hours.\n\nNow, to find the total time, I need to add 5/3 and 15/8.\n\nTo add fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's see, 3 and 8 have a least common multiple of 24.\n\nSo, converting both fractions to 24ths:\n\n5/3 = (5*8)/(3*8) = 40/24\n\n15/8 = (15*3)/(8*3) = 45/24\n\nNow, adding them together: 40/24 + 45/24 = 85/24 hours.\n\n85/24 hours is the same as 3 and 13/24 hours, since 24*3 = 72, and 85 - 72 = 13.\n\nSo, the total time is 3 hours and 13/24 of an hour.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express the fractional part in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 13/24 of an hour is (13/24)*60 minutes.\n\nLet's calculate that: 13/24 * 60 = (13*60)/24 = 780/24 = 32.5 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time is 3 hours and 32.5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I could keep it as 85/24 hours, but maybe the problem wants the answer in hours and minutes.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify the format of the answer. It just says \"how long does it take.\"\n\nI think providing it in hours and minutes would be more understandable.\n\nSo, the train takes 3 hours and 32.5 minutes to complete its journey.\n\nBut, typically, we don't write 32.5 minutes; maybe it's better to write it as 3 hours and 32 minutes and 30 seconds.\n\nWait, 0.5 minutes is 30 seconds.\n\nSo, 3 hours, 32 minutes, and 30 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in hours, I could leave it as 85/24 hours or as a decimal.\n\nLet me convert 85/24 to a decimal. 85 divided by 24 is 3.541666... hours.\n\nBut I think the fractional form is more precise.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to say 85/24 hours, which is approximately 3.5417 hours.\n\nBut again, expressing it in hours, minutes, and seconds might be more intuitive.\n\nSo, 3 hours, 32 minutes, and 30 seconds.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n13/24 * 60 minutes = 32.5 minutes.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the train takes 3 hours, 32 minutes, and 30 seconds to complete its journey.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects just hours, I can leave it as 85/24 hours.\n\nBut I think providing it in hours, minutes, and seconds makes more sense for a real-world scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in hours as a decimal.\n\nIn that case, 85/24 is approximately 3.5417 hours.\n\nBut I think the fractional form is better to avoid rounding errors.\n\nSo, the total time is 85/24 hours, which is 3 hours, 32 minutes, and 30 seconds.\n\nI think that's the complete answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{85}{24} \\text{ hours} \\text{ or } 3 \\text{ hours, } 32 \\text{ minutes, and } 30 \\text{ seconds}} \\]"
