        "content": "So I've got this problem here about creating an exhibit for five different species of animals in a zoo, and I need to figure out the maximum number of animals that can be included while making sure that all species are represented, given a total space of 100,000 square feet. Each species has its own space requirement:\n\n- Species A: 5,000 sq ft per animal\n\n- Species B: 2,000 sq ft per animal\n\n- Species C: 10,000 sq ft per animal\n\n- Species D: 1,000 sq ft per animal\n\n- Species E: 500 sq ft per animal\n\nThe goal is to maximize the total number of animals, but I have to include at least one of each species. That's an important constraint because it ensures representation of all species.\n\nFirst, I need to account for the minimum space required to have at least one of each species. Let's calculate that:\n\n- One Species A: 5,000 sq ft\n\n- One Species B: 2,000 sq ft\n\n- One Species C: 10,000 sq ft\n\n- One Species D: 1,000 sq ft\n\n- One Species E: 500 sq ft\n\nAdding these up: 5,000 + 2,000 + 10,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 18,500 sq ft\n\nSo, the minimum space to have at least one of each species is 18,500 sq ft. Given that the total available space is 100,000 sq ft, the remaining space after placing one of each species is:\n\n100,000 - 18,500 = 81,500 sq ft\n\nNow, to maximize the total number of animals, I should use this remaining space to add as many additional animals as possible. To maximize the number, I should prioritize adding animals that require the least amount of space per animal because they allow more individuals within the same space.\n\nLooking at the space requirements:\n\n- Species E: 500 sq ft per animal\n\n- Species D: 1,000 sq ft per animal\n\n- Species B: 2,000 sq ft per animal\n\n- Species A: 5,000 sq ft per animal\n\n- Species C: 10,000 sq ft per animal\n\nSpecies E requires the least space per animal, so it makes sense to add as many of these as possible first, then move to the next smallest, and so on, until the remaining space is fully utilized.\n\nLet's calculate how many additional Species E animals can be added to the remaining 81,500 sq ft:\n\n81,500 / 500 = 163 animals\n\nSo, we can add 163 more Species E animals. But we need to check if there's any space left after adding these.\n\nSpace used by 163 Species E animals: 163 * 500 = 81,500 sq ft\n\nSo, 81,500 - 81,500 = 0 sq ft remaining\n\nWait, that's exactly fitting into the remaining space. So, with one of each species initially and 163 additional Species E animals, the total number of animals would be:\n\n- Species A: 1\n\n- Species B: 1\n\n- Species C: 1\n\n- Species D: 1\n\n- Species E: 1 + 163 = 164\n\nTotal animals: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 164 = 168 animals\n\nBut is this the maximum possible? Let's consider if there's a better way to allocate the remaining space to get more animals.\n\nMaybe instead of adding only Species E, I can add a combination of Species D and E to see if that yields more animals.\n\nLet's try allocating the remaining space by first adding Species D animals:\n\nEach Species D requires 1,000 sq ft.\n\n81,500 / 1,000 = 81 animals\n\nSo, we can add 81 additional Species D animals, using 81,000 sq ft.\n\nRemaining space: 81,500 - 81,000 = 500 sq ft\n\nWith the remaining 500 sq ft, I can add one more Species E animal.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- Species A: 1\n\n- Species B: 1\n\n- Species C: 1\n\n- Species D: 1 + 81 = 82\n\n- Species E: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nTotal animals: 1 + 1 + 1 + 82 + 2 = 87 animals\n\nComparing this to the previous total of 168 animals, the first approach yields more animals.\n\nAlternatively, let's try a different combination: adding some Species D and some Species E.\n\nSuppose I add x Species D and y Species E, such that:\n\n1,000x + 500y \u2264 81,500\n\nAnd I want to maximize x + y.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, but since we're dealing with integers, it's an integer programming problem.\n\nTo maximize x + y, subject to 1,000x + 500y \u2264 81,500.\n\nWe can simplify this inequality by dividing by 500:\n\n2x + y \u2264 163\n\nSo, y \u2264 163 - 2x\n\nThen, x + y \u2264 x + (163 - 2x) = 163 - x\n\nTo maximize x + y, we need to minimize x. The smallest x can be is 0.\n\nSo, x = 0, y = 163, giving x + y = 163\n\nWait, but in the first approach, we had 164 Species E animals, which seems consistent.\n\nBut in the second approach, adding Species D, we got fewer total animals.\n\nTherefore, it seems that adding only the smallest species, Species E, maximizes the total number of animals.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's a way to include more of the smaller species by excluding one of the larger species initially.\n\nBut the problem states that all species must be represented, meaning we must have at least one of each.\n\nSo, we cannot exclude any species entirely.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach seems correct: allocate the minimum space for one of each species, then use the remaining space to add as many of the smallest species as possible.\n\nThus, the maximum number of animals is 168.\n\nWait, but let's double-check the calculations.\n\nInitial space for one of each species:\n\nA: 5,000\n\nB: 2,000\n\nC: 10,000\n\nD: 1,000\n\nE: 500\n\nTotal: 5,000 + 2,000 = 7,000; plus 10,000 is 17,000; plus 1,000 is 18,000; plus 500 is 18,500 sq ft.\n\nRemaining space: 100,000 - 18,500 = 81,500 sq ft.\n\nNumber of additional Species E animals: 81,500 / 500 = 163\n\nTotal Species E animals: 1 + 163 = 164\n\nTotal animals: 1 (A) + 1 (B) + 1 (C) + 1 (D) + 164 (E) = 168 animals.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to add some Species D animals instead of Species E:\n\nEach Species D requires 1,000 sq ft.\n\nNumber of additional Species D animals: 81,500 / 1,000 = 81 animals (with 500 sq ft left over)\n\nSo, 81 additional Species D animals plus 1 additional Species E animal (using the remaining 500 sq ft).\n\nTotal animals: 1 (A) + 1 (B) + 1 (C) + 1 (D) + 81 (D) + 1 (E) = 86 animals\n\nThis is fewer than 168.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach seems better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a combination of Species D and E.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x be the number of additional Species D animals.\n\nLet y be the number of additional Species E animals.\n\nThen, the space constraint is:\n\n1,000x + 500y \u2264 81,500\n\nWe want to maximize x + y.\n\nTo maximize x + y, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny \u2264 (81,500 - 1,000x) / 500 = 163 - 2x\n\nSo, x + y \u2264 x + 163 - 2x = 163 - x\n\nTo maximize x + y, we need to minimize x.\n\nThe smallest x can be is 0, so x = 0, y = 163.\n\nThus, x + y = 163.\n\nAdding to the initial animals: 1 (A) + 1 (B) + 1 (C) + 1 (D) + 1 (E) + 163 (E) = 168 animals.\n\nAny other combination will result in fewer total animals.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of animals is indeed 168.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{168} \\]"
