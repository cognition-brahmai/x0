        "content": "So, I have this problem here: an ice cream shop sells 12 flavors of ice cream and 4 types of cones. The question is, how many different single-scoop ice creams can you buy? And I need to explain it, right?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, there are 12 flavors and 4 types of cones. I need to find out how many different combinations there are for a single scoop. Hmm.\n\nI remember that when you have multiple choices for different categories, and you want to find the total number of possible combinations, you multiply the number of choices in each category together. Is that right?\n\nSo, in this case, for each flavor, there are 4 types of cones to choose from. That means for one flavor, there are 4 different ways to have it, depending on the cone type.\n\nSince there are 12 flavors, and each flavor can be paired with any of the 4 cones, the total number of different single-scoop ice creams would be 12 flavors times 4 cones.\n\nLet me write that down: 12 flavors \u00d7 4 cones = 48 different single-scoop ice creams.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I should consider if there are any restrictions or if choosing a cone type affects the flavor choice in any way. But the problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so I think multiplying the two numbers directly is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out the possibilities. For example, if there were only 2 flavors and 2 cone types, then the combinations would be:\n\n1. Flavor A with Cone Type 1\n\n2. Flavor A with Cone Type 2\n\n3. Flavor B with Cone Type 1\n\n4. Flavor B with Cone Type 2\n\nSo, that's 2 flavors \u00d7 2 cones = 4 combinations.\n\nSimilarly, in this problem, with 12 flavors and 4 cones, it should be 12 \u00d7 4 = 48.\n\nI think that makes sense. Is there any other factor I should consider? Maybe if some cones are only compatible with certain flavors, but again, the problem doesn't specify that, so I assume all cones can be paired with all flavors.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"single-scoop\" ice creams, so we're not considering multiple scoops here. That simplifies things because we don't have to worry about combinations of different flavors in one serving.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the total number of different single-scoop ice creams you can buy is 48.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
