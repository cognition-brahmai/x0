        "content": "I'm going to attempt to write a Go program that monitors a specified directory for changes such as file creation, modification, or deletion, and then sends notifications about these changes to a specified email address using an SMTP server.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the requirements clearly:\n\n1. **Directory Monitoring:** The program needs to watch a specific directory for any changes. These changes include:\n\n- Creation of new files or subdirectories.\n\n- Modification of existing files.\n\n- Deletion of files or subdirectories.\n\n2. **Notification System:** Whenever a change is detected, the program should send an email notification to a specified email address. This email should be sent via an SMTP server.\n\nGiven that, I need to break down the task into manageable parts:\n\n### Part 1: Directory Monitoring\n\nIn Go, the `fsnotify` package is commonly used for file system notifications. It provides a cross-platform interface to filesystem events.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Import the necessary packages, including `fsnotify`.\n\n- Set up a watcher for the specified directory.\n\n- Handle different types of events (create, write, remove).\n\n### Part 2: Email Notification\n\nTo send emails via SMTP, I can use Go's `net/smtp` package or a higher-level library like `gopkg.in/gomail.v2` for more convenience.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Configure SMTP settings (server address, port, authentication credentials).\n\n- Compose an email message that includes details about the file system event.\n\n- Send the email.\n\n### Part 3: Integration\n\nCombine the monitoring and notification parts so that whenever a file system event is detected, an email is sent with details about the event.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Error Handling:** Ensure that the program handles errors gracefully, such as failures in watching the directory or sending emails.\n\n- **Configuration:** Allow configuration of the directory to watch and email settings via command-line arguments or a configuration file.\n\n- **Performance:** Consider the performance impact, especially if the monitored directory has a high volume of changes.\n\n- **Security:** Handle credentials securely, especially SMTP credentials.\n\n### Initial Code Structure\n\nI'll start by setting up the basic structure of the program, including importing necessary packages and setting up the command-line flags for configuration.\n\nHere's a rough outline of the code structure:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"flag\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n\n    \"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n    \"gopkg.in/gomail.v2\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Define command-line flags for directory, email, SMTP settings, etc.\n    dir := flag.String(\"dir\", \".\", \"Directory to watch\")\n    toEmail := flag.String(\"to\", \"\", \"Recipient email address\")\n    fromEmail := flag.String(\"from\", \"\", \"Sender email address\")\n    smtpHost := flag.String(\"smtpHost\", \"smtp.example.com\", \"SMTP server host\")\n    smtpPort := flag.Int(\"smtpPort\", 587, \"SMTP server port\")\n    smtpUser := flag.String(\"smtpUser\", \"\", \"SMTP username\")\n    smtpPass := flag.String(\"smtpPass\", \"\", \"SMTP password\")\n\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    // Set up fsnotify watcher\n    watcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    defer watcher.Close()\n\n    done := make(chan bool)\n    go func() {\n        for {\n            select {\n            case event := <-watcher.Events:\n                // Handle event and send email\n                log.Println(\"event:\", event)\n                if event.Op&fsnotify.Create == fsnotify.Create {\n                    sendEmail(*toEmail, *fromEmail, *smtpHost, *smtpPort, *smtpUser, *smtpPass, \"File Created\", fmt.Sprintf(\"File %s was created.\", event.Name))\n                } else if event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {\n                    sendEmail(*toEmail, *fromEmail, *smtpHost, *smtpPort, *smtpUser, *smtpPass, \"File Modified\", fmt.Sprintf(\"File %s was modified.\", event.Name))\n                } else if event.Op&fsnotify.Remove == fsnotify.Remove {\n                    sendEmail(*toEmail, *fromEmail, *smtpHost, *smtpPort, *smtpUser, *smtpPass, \"File Deleted\", fmt.Sprintf(\"File %s was deleted.\", event.Name))\n                }\n            case err := <-watcher.Errors:\n                log.Println(\"error:\", err)\n            }\n        }\n    }()\n\n    err = watcher.Add(*dir)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    log.Println(\"Watcher started for directory:\", *dir)\n\n    <-done\n}\n\nfunc sendEmail(to, from, host, port, user, pass, subject, body string) {\n    m := gomail.NewMessage()\n    m.SetHeader(\"From\", from)\n    m.SetHeader(\"To\", to)\n    m.SetHeader(\"Subject\", subject)\n    m.SetBody(\"text/plain\", body)\n\n    d := gomail.NewDialer(host, port, user, pass)\n\n    // Send the email to Brian\n    if err := d.DialAndSend(m); err != nil {\n        log.Println(err)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Command-Line Flags:** The program accepts several flags to configure the directory to watch, email settings, and SMTP server details.\n\n2. **fsnotify Watcher:** A watcher is set up to monitor the specified directory for events.\n\n3. **Event Handling:** For each event (create, write, remove), an email is sent using the `sendEmail` function.\n\n4. **sendEmail Function:** This function composes and sends an email using the Gomail library.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- Test the program with different scenarios (file creation, modification, deletion).\n\n- Handle errors more gracefully, especially in the email sending function.\n\n- Consider adding more detailed information in the email, such as timestamp or file properties.\n\n- Optionally, extend the program to monitor subdirectories recursively.\n\nThis should provide a solid starting point for the required program."
