He created this masterpiece while he was residing at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France, in 1889. Van Gogh had voluntarily admitted himself to this asylum after experiencing mental health struggles, during which he produced some of his most iconic works, including \"Starry Night.\" This particular painting is known for its swirling skies, the prominent cypress tree, and the dreamlike quality of the village below, showcasing van Gogh's unique style and emotional expression through art."
