        "content": "Let's see. Jane wants to buy cupcakes for her class of 30 students, and the cupcakes come in boxes of 6. So, I need to figure out how many boxes she should buy to have enough for everyone.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out how many cupcakes she needs in total. Since there are 30 students, she probably needs 30 cupcakes, one for each student.\n\nNow, each box contains 6 cupcakes. So, to find out how many boxes she needs, I should divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per box. That is, 30 divided by 6.\n\n30 divided by 6 is 5. So, she needs 5 boxes to get 30 cupcakes.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there might be any extra cupcakes needed. Maybe some students want more than one cupcake, or perhaps there might be some cupcakes that are damaged. It's always good to have a few extras.\n\nOn the other hand, the problem says she wants to buy cupcakes for her class of 30 students, and it doesn't mention any need for extras. So, perhaps 5 boxes are sufficient.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If she buys 5 boxes, that's exactly 30 cupcakes, one for each student. There won't be any leftovers, which might be fine if she doesn't need extras.\n\nHowever, in real life, it's often safer to have a few extra cupcakes to account for any unexpected requests or damages. But since this is a math problem, it might be expecting a precise calculation based on the information given, without considering additional real-life factors.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says \"Jane wants to buy cupcakes for her class of 30 students.\" It doesn't specify that she needs exactly one per student or that she might need extras. So, based on the information provided, 5 boxes should be sufficient.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the boxes can be opened and cupcakes can be taken out individually. If the boxes are sealed and can't be opened, she might need to buy more boxes to ensure everyone gets a cupcake.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the boxes being sealed or not. It just says cupcakes come in boxes of 6.\n\nAssuming the boxes can be opened and cupcakes can be distributed individually, then 5 boxes should be enough.\n\nAlternatively, if the boxes must be kept closed and given whole to students, then she would need to buy enough boxes so that each student gets one box, which would be 30 boxes. But that seems unlikely, as each box contains 6 cupcakes, and giving each student a whole box would be excessive.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Probably, the boxes are to hold the cupcakes, and they are opened to distribute the cupcakes individually.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial thought, 5 boxes containing 30 cupcakes should be sufficient for 30 students.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there is any possibility of cupcakes being damaged or some students wanting more.\n\nIf there's a chance that some cupcakes might be damaged, she might want to buy an extra box to account for that. Similarly, if some students want more than one cupcake, having extras would be helpful.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify any of these scenarios, it's likely that the expected answer is based on the exact number needed without extras.\n\nTherefore, Jane should buy 5 boxes of cupcakes.\n\nWait, but let's double-check the division. 30 divided by 6 is indeed 5. So, 5 boxes times 6 cupcakes per box equals 30 cupcakes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if she buys 4 boxes, that would be 24 cupcakes, which is not enough for 30 students. So, 4 boxes are insufficient.\n\nIf she buys 5 boxes, that's 30 cupcakes, which is exactly enough.\n\nIf she buys 6 boxes, that's 36 cupcakes, which is more than needed.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify needing extras, and to avoid waste, buying exactly 5 boxes seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nTherefore, Jane should buy 5 boxes of cupcakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
