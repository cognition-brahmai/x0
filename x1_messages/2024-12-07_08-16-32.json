The expression is:\n\n((7 + 4)^2 - (5 * 3)) / (10 - 2 * 3)\n\nFirst, I'll handle the operations inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with the numerator:\n\n(7 + 4)^2 - (5 * 3)\n\n7 + 4 is 11, so that part becomes 11^2.\n\n11 squared is 121.\n\nThen, 5 * 3 is 15.\n\nSo, the numerator is 121 - 15, which is 106.\n\nNow, the denominator:\n\n10 - 2 * 3\n\nAccording to order of operations, I need to do the multiplication first.\n\n2 * 3 is 6.\n\nThen, 10 - 6 is 4.\n\nSo, the denominator is 4.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 106 / 4.\n\n106 divided by 4 is 26.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 26.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26.5} \\]"
