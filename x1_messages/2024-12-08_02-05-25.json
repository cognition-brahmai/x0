        "content": "Let's tackle this break-even analysis problem step by step. So, we have a company with fixed monthly costs and variable costs per unit, and they sell each unit at a certain price. We need to find out how many units they need to sell to break even.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"break even\" means. Breaking even occurs when the total revenue equals the total costs. Total costs include both fixed costs and variable costs.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Fixed monthly cost: $10,000\n\n- Variable cost per unit: $5\n\n- Selling price per unit: $15\n\nLet's denote the number of units needed to break even as \\( q \\).\n\nThe total revenue (TR) from selling \\( q \\) units is:\n\n\\[ TR = 15q \\]\n\nThe total cost (TC) of producing \\( q \\) units is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost for all units:\n\n\\[ TC = 10,000 + 5q \\]\n\nAt the break-even point, TR equals TC:\n\n\\[ 15q = 10,000 + 5q \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( q \\).\n\nFirst, subtract \\( 5q \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 15q - 5q = 10,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 10q = 10,000 \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 10:\n\n\\[ q = \\frac{10,000}{10} \\]\n\n\\[ q = 1,000 \\]\n\nSo, the company needs to sell 1,000 units to break even.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nI recall that the break-even quantity can also be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ q = \\frac{\\text{fixed costs}}{\\text{contribution margin per unit}} \\]\n\nWhere the contribution margin per unit is the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit.\n\nSo, contribution margin per unit:\n\n\\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThen, break-even quantity:\n\n\\[ q = \\frac{10,000}{10} = 1,000 \\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. Are there any taxes or other expenses that aren't accounted for in the fixed or variable costs? The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume that the fixed costs only include what's given, and no other expenses like taxes or discounts.\n\nAlso, it's assumed that the selling price and variable costs per unit remain constant regardless of the quantity produced and sold. In reality, economies of scale might affect variable costs at larger scales, but again, the problem doesn't suggest any such changes.\n\nAnother assumption is that all units produced are sold. If there's any unsold inventory, that would affect the break-even point. But based on the information provided, we're assuming that everything produced is sold.\n\nSo, sticking with the given data and standard break-even analysis, the company needs to sell 1,000 units to break even.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's plug \\( q = 1,000 \\) back into the equations for total revenue and total cost to verify.\n\nTotal revenue:\n\n\\[ TR = 15 \\times 1,000 = 15,000 \\]\n\nTotal cost:\n\n\\[ TC = 10,000 + 5 \\times 1,000 = 10,000 + 5,000 = 15,000 \\]\n\nYes, TR equals TC at \\( q = 1,000 \\), confirming that this is indeed the break-even point.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. However, if the problem were more complex, involving different levels of production, variable selling prices, or other factors, the analysis would need to be adjusted accordingly. But for this straightforward case, 1,000 units is the answer.\n\nOne more thing: it's important to consider the time frame. The fixed costs are given as monthly, so this break-even point is on a monthly basis. If the time frame were annual, the fixed costs would need to be adjusted accordingly. But since the problem specifies monthly costs, the break-even is per month.\n\nIn summary, the company needs to sell 1,000 units per month to break even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
