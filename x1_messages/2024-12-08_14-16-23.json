        "content": "Certainly! Below is a JavaScript function that performs a binary search on a sorted array of integers. It takes two arguments: the array and the target integer to find. If the target number is found, it returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1.\n\n```javascript\nfunction binarySearch(arr, target) {\n    let left = 0;\n    let right = arr.length - 1;\n    \n    while (left <= right) {\n        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);\n        \n        if (arr[mid] === target) {\n            return mid;\n        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\n            left = mid + 1;\n        } else {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return -1;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst sortedArray = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15];\nconst target = 7;\nconsole.log(binarySearch(sortedArray, target)); // Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `left` starts at the beginning of the array (index 0).\n   - `right` starts at the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`).\n\n2. **While Loop**:\n   - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.\n   - In each iteration, the middle index `mid` is calculated using `Math.floor((left + right) / 2)`.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - If the middle element `arr[mid]` is equal to the target, return `mid`.\n   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, adjust `left` to `mid + 1` to search the right half.\n   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, adjust `right` to `mid - 1` to search the left half.\n\n4. **Not Found**:\n   - If the loop exits without finding the target, return -1.\n\nThis function efficiently searches for the target in O(log n) time complexity, which is much faster than a linear search for large arrays."
