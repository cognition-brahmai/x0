        "content": "Let's see, I've got this question about redshift in astronomy. So, redshift is something that comes up a lot when people talk about stars and galaxies moving away from us, and stuff like that. But let's look at the options here to make sure I get it right.\n\nOption A says: \"The shift in the position of a star due to Earth's rotation.\" Hmm, Earth's rotation causes things like the apparent movement of stars across the sky, but that's more about how we see the sky from Earth, not about the properties of the light coming from the stars themselves. So, I don't think that's redshift.\n\nOption B says: \"The change in the observed wavelength of light due to the motion of the source.\" Okay, this sounds familiar. I think this is the Doppler effect applied to light. So, if a star or galaxy is moving away from us, the light it emits gets stretched out, and that means the wavelength increases, which shifts towards the red end of the spectrum. Similarly, if it's moving towards us, the light gets compressed, and the wavelength decreases, shifting towards the blue end. So, this seems like a strong candidate for what redshift is.\n\nOption C says: \"The color change in a star as it ages and cools.\" Well, stars do change color as they age and their temperatures change. For example, a cool red giant star will emit more red light, while a hot blue star emits more blue light. But this is about the intrinsic properties of the star, not about its motion. So, this seems different from redshift.\n\nOption D says: \"The shift in the position of a planet due to its orbit around the sun.\" This sounds more like planetary motion and how their positions change in the sky over time, which is related to astronomy but doesn't directly relate to the concept of redshift, which is about light wavelengths.\n\nOption E is \"None of the above,\" but given that option B seems to accurately describe redshift, I don't think I need to consider this.\n\nSo, based on what I've recalled, redshift is about the change in the wavelength of light due to the motion of the source. It's a key concept in astronomy because it allows us to determine how fast celestial objects are moving away from or towards us, which has been crucial in understanding the expansion of the universe.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me make sure there aren't any other meanings or contexts where \"redshift\" might refer to something else in astronomy. For example, I've heard of gravitational redshift, where light from a strong gravitational field is shifted to longer wavelengths due to the gravity, not due to motion. But even in that case, it's still about the wavelength of light being shifted, so it's related to option B, albeit for a different reason.\n\nSo, overall, I think the correct answer is B: \"The change in the observed wavelength of light due to the motion of the source.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
