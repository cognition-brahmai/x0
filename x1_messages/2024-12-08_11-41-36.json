        "content": "So I've got this problem about a library, and I need to figure out how many books are in the entire library. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the library has 5 floors. That seems straightforward. Each of these floors has 8 sections. So, if there are 5 floors and each has 8 sections, I can find the total number of sections by multiplying 5 by 8. Let's do that:\n\n5 floors \u00d7 8 sections per floor = 40 sections\n\nOkay, so there are 40 sections in total.\n\nNow, each section contains 30 shelves. So, to find the total number of shelves in the library, I should multiply the number of sections by the number of shelves per section:\n\n40 sections \u00d7 30 shelves per section = 1200 shelves\n\nAlright, so there are 1200 shelves in the library.\n\nFinally, each shelf holds 25 books. To find the total number of books, I need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:\n\n1200 shelves \u00d7 25 books per shelf\n\nHmm, what's 1200 times 25? Let me think about this. I know that 100 times 25 is 2500, so 1200 times 25 would be 12 times 2500. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, 25 is the same as 100 divided by 4, so 1200 times 25 would be 1200 times 100, which is 120,000, and then divided by 4, which is 30,000.\n\nWait, but I think I can verify that. Let me see:\n\n1200 \u00d7 25\n\nI can break it down further. 1200 \u00d7 20 is 24,000, and 1200 \u00d7 5 is 6,000. Adding those together:\n\n24,000 + 6,000 = 30,000\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, there are 30,000 books in the library.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, 5 floors \u00d7 8 sections = 40 sections.\n\nThen, 40 sections \u00d7 30 shelves = 1,200 shelves.\n\nFinally, 1,200 shelves \u00d7 25 books = 30,000 books.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply all the numbers together at once:\n\n5 floors \u00d7 8 sections/floor \u00d7 30 shelves/section \u00d7 25 books/shelf\n\nThat would be:\n\n5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n\n40 \u00d7 30 = 1,200\n\n1,200 \u00d7 25 = 30,000\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30000} \\]"
