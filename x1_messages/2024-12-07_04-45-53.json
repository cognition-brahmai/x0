        "content": "So the national park wants to build new hiking trails to handle more visitors. They've got 100 miles of trails right now, which can handle up to 1,000 hikers per day. Their goal is to increase that capacity by 50% without messing up the natural environment. Building new trails costs $20,000 per mile, and they have a budget of $2 million for this project.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what a 50% increase in capacity means in terms of hikers per day. If they currently handle 1,000 hikers per day, a 50% increase would be:\n\n1,000 hikers * 0.5 = 500 additional hikers\n\nSo, they want to handle up to 1,500 hikers per day.\n\nNext, I need to determine how much trail is needed to handle these additional hikers. Currently, 100 miles handle 1,000 hikers. So, the ratio of miles to hikers is:\n\n100 miles / 1,000 hikers = 0.1 miles per hiker\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because 0.1 miles per hiker is too little. Maybe it's better to look at it as hikers per mile:\n\n1,000 hikers / 100 miles = 10 hikers per mile\n\nSo, each mile of trail can handle 10 hikers per day.\n\nNow, to handle 1,500 hikers per day, how many miles of trail are needed?\n\n1,500 hikers / 10 hikers per mile = 150 miles\n\nThey already have 100 miles, so they need to build:\n\n150 miles - 100 miles = 50 additional miles\n\nNow, considering the cost: $20,000 per mile.\n\nSo, the total cost for 50 miles would be:\n\n50 miles * $20,000/mile = $1,000,000\n\nThey have a budget of $2 million, so $1,000,000 is within their budget.\n\nBut wait, maybe they can build more trails with the remaining budget to provide more options or reduce environmental impact.\n\nThey have $2,000,000 budget, and the required trails cost $1,000,000, so they have:\n\n$2,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000 left\n\nWith the remaining $1,000,000, they can build additional trails:\n\n$1,000,000 / $20,000 per mile = 50 miles\n\nSo, they could build an extra 50 miles of trails within their budget.\n\nBut the goal was only to increase capacity by 50%, which requires 50 miles. Building extra trails might be beneficial for distributing hikers and minimizing environmental impact.\n\nHowever, they need to ensure that building additional trails doesn't compromise the natural environment. Maybe they should consider building fewer miles but making them more sustainable or designing them to handle more hikers per mile.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they can invest in improving existing trails to handle more hikers without building new ones.\n\nBut based on the initial calculation, to achieve the desired capacity increase of 50%, they need to build 50 additional miles of trails, which would cost $1,000,000, well within their $2 million budget.\n\nTherefore, yes, the available budget is sufficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
