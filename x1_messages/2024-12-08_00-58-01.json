        "content": "So there are 5 cats in a room, and each cat catches 3 mice. That means there are 5 times 3, which is 15 mice caught in total. Now, each of these mice has eaten 2 pieces of cheese. So, if we want to find out how many pieces of cheese the cats saved by catching these mice, we need to calculate how much cheese those mice would have eaten if they hadn't been caught.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many pieces of cheese all the mice have eaten before being caught. Since each mouse ate 2 pieces of cheese, and there are 15 mice, that would be 15 times 2, which equals 30 pieces of cheese.\n\nNow, by catching these mice, the cats have prevented those mice from eating more cheese in the future. But the question is asking for how many pieces of cheese the cats saved, which likely refers to the cheese that the mice have already eaten.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"how many pieces of cheese did the cats save?\" This could be a bit ambiguous. One interpretation is that by catching the mice, the cats have saved the cheese that the mice would have eaten if they hadn't been caught. Another interpretation is that the cats saved the cheese by removing the mice that have already eaten some cheese.\n\nLet's consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The cats saved the cheese that the mice would have eaten in the future. But the problem doesn't specify how much cheese the mice would have eaten further; it only says that each mouse has eaten 2 pieces of cheese. Without information on future consumption, we can't calculate future savings.\n\nSecond interpretation: The cats saved the cheese by removing the mice that have already eaten some cheese. In this case, the cats have prevented further eating by removing the mice, but again, without knowing how much more cheese the mice would have eaten, we can't determine the exact savings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the total amount of cheese that the mice have already eaten, implying that by catching the mice, the cats have removed the mice that have eaten that amount of cheese.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total pieces of cheese eaten by the mice before being caught is 15 mice times 2 pieces each, which is 30 pieces.\n\nBut the problem says \"saved,\" which might imply preventing loss rather than just removing the cause after some damage has been done.\n\nMaybe another way to look at it: if the mice were allowed to continue eating, the cats by catching them have stopped them from eating more cheese. But again, without knowing future consumption, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to say that by catching the mice, the cats have stopped them from eating those 2 pieces each, hence saving that cheese.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because if the mice have already eaten the cheese, then catching them wouldn't save that cheese; it would be too late.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is worded poorly. Let's re-examine it.\n\n\"Each cat catches 3 mice, and each mouse has eaten 2 pieces of cheese. How many pieces of cheese did the cats save?\"\n\nIf the mice have already eaten the cheese before being caught, then catching them doesn't save that cheese; it's already been eaten.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mice were in the process of eating the cheese, and by catching them, the cats saved the remaining cheese they wouldn't have eaten.\n\nBut again, without knowing the total amount of cheese or the rate at which mice eat cheese, it's impossible to determine.\n\nPerhaps the problem is simplifying things and assuming that by catching the mice, the cats have stopped them from eating the cheese they would have eaten.\n\nIn that case, if each mouse had eaten 2 pieces of cheese, and there are 15 mice caught, then the cats have saved 15 times 2 equals 30 pieces of cheese.\n\nBut this assumes that the mice would have continued eating cheese if not caught, which may not be entirely accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each mouse was in the process of eating 2 pieces of cheese, and by catching them, the cats have stopped them from finishing eating those pieces.\n\nIn that case, the cats have saved the remaining portions of those 2 pieces per mouse.\n\nBut again, without knowing how much of the cheese has already been eaten, we can't determine how much is saved.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nLet's consider a simpler approach.\n\nIf each mouse has eaten 2 pieces of cheese, and there are 15 mice caught, then the total cheese eaten is 30 pieces.\n\nIf the cats catch the mice, they prevent further eating, so the cheese saved would be the cheese that would have been eaten by those mice in the future.\n\nBut since we don't know future consumption, perhaps the problem is just asking for the cheese that the mice have already eaten.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that by catching the mice, the cats have removed them, thus stopping them from eating more cheese, and the cheese they would have eaten is considered saved.\n\nIn that case, if each mouse would have eaten 2 more pieces of cheese, then the cats saved 15 times 2 equals 30 pieces.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each mouse was about to eat 2 pieces of cheese, and by catching them, the cats saved those 2 pieces per mouse.\n\nAgain, this is unclear.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is that by catching the mice, the cats have removed them, thereby stopping them from eating the cheese they would have eaten.\n\nIf each mouse had eaten 2 pieces already, and assuming they would have eaten another 2 pieces if not caught, then the cats saved 2 pieces per mouse.\n\nThus, 15 mice times 2 pieces each equals 30 pieces saved.\n\nBut this is just one way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cats saved the cheese by removing the mice that have already eaten some cheese, implying that the cheese those mice would have eaten in the future is saved.\n\nBut without knowing future consumption, it's hard to say.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nSuppose there is a total of X pieces of cheese.\n\nEach mouse has eaten 2 pieces, so the total eaten by 15 mice is 30 pieces.\n\nTherefore, the remaining cheese is X - 30 pieces.\n\nBy catching the mice, the cats have prevented them from eating more cheese, so the saved cheese is the remaining cheese plus the cheese that the mice would have eaten if not caught.\n\nBut without knowing X or future consumption, this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the cats have saved the cheese that the mice were going to eat, in addition to what they've already eaten.\n\nIn that case, if each mouse was going to eat 2 pieces, then the cats saved 2 pieces per mouse, totaling 30 pieces.\n\nBut this seems similar to earlier thoughts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cats have saved the cheese by removing the mice that have eaten some cheese, thereby preventing further damage.\n\nIn this case, the saved cheese would be the cheese that those mice would have eaten in the future.\n\nAgain, without knowing future consumption, it's unclear.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is that the cats saved the cheese that the mice would have eaten if not caught, which is 2 pieces per mouse, totaling 30 pieces.\n\nTherefore, the cats saved 30 pieces of cheese.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
