Responsibilities and all that. Anyway, I might be a bit late for dinner tonight. Nothing to worry about; I just need to swing by and handle a little situation that's popped up.\n\nI promise it's nothing serious, just some guys causing trouble down at the old warehouse district. I figured it'd be quicker to deal with it now before they cause any real damage. Plus, it'll give me a chance to get some exercise before digging into those meatballs you made. Yum!\n\nI'll try to wrap things up as soon as possible and be right over. Maybe I can even swing by the grocery store really fast to pick up that wine you like. Fingers crossed, eh?\n\nThanks for understanding, Aunt May. You're the best.\n\n**Your favorite wall-crawler,**\n\n**Spider-Man**\n\n**(aka Your Nephew, Peter)**"
