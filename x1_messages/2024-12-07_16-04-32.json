        "content": "So the factory is producing widgets in batches, and there's a pattern to how many widgets are in each batch. The first batch has 100 widgets, and each batch after that has 10 more widgets than the one before it. So, the second batch has 110, the third has 120, and so on, up to the tenth batch.\n\nI need to find out how many widgets are produced in total after the tenth batch. To do this, I should probably figure out how many widgets are in each batch and then add them all up.\n\nLet me start by listing out the number of widgets in each batch:\n\n- Batch 1: 100 widgets\n\n- Batch 2: 100 + 10 = 110 widgets\n\n- Batch 3: 110 + 10 = 120 widgets\n\n- Batch 4: 120 + 10 = 130 widgets\n\n- Batch 5: 130 + 10 = 140 widgets\n\n- Batch 6: 140 + 10 = 150 widgets\n\n- Batch 7: 150 + 10 = 160 widgets\n\n- Batch 8: 160 + 10 = 170 widgets\n\n- Batch 9: 170 + 10 = 180 widgets\n\n- Batch 10: 180 + 10 = 190 widgets\n\nNow, I need to add all these up to get the total number of widgets after ten batches.\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nStart with batch 1: 100\n\nAdd batch 2: 100 + 110 = 210\n\nAdd batch 3: 210 + 120 = 330\n\nAdd batch 4: 330 + 130 = 460\n\nAdd batch 5: 460 + 140 = 600\n\nAdd batch 6: 600 + 150 = 750\n\nAdd batch 7: 750 + 160 = 910\n\nAdd batch 8: 910 + 170 = 1080\n\nAdd batch 9: 1080 + 180 = 1260\n\nAdd batch 10: 1260 + 190 = 1450\n\nSo, the total number of widgets after ten batches is 1450.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without listing out each batch and adding them one by one? It seems a bit time-consuming, especially if there were more batches.\n\nI recall that this is an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a constant difference. In this case, the first term (a1) is 100, and the common difference (d) is 10.\n\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nSo, for the tenth batch:\n\na10 = 100 + (10 - 1) * 10 = 100 + 90 = 190\n\nThat matches what I had earlier for batch 10.\n\nNow, to find the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence, there's a formula for that:\n\nSn = n/2 * (a1 + an)\n\nWhere Sn is the sum of the first n terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the nth term.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nS10 = 10/2 * (100 + 190) = 5 * 290 = 1450\n\nThat's the same answer I got earlier by adding them up one by one.\n\nIt's good to see that both methods give the same result. So, the factory will have produced 1450 widgets after completing the tenth batch.\n\nI think that's the answer, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check another way.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the number of widgets in each batch as follows:\n\nBatch 1: 100\n\nBatch 2: 100 + 10\n\nBatch 3: 100 + 20\n\n...\n\nBatch 10: 100 + 90\n\nSo, the total number of widgets is:\n\n10 * 100 + (10 + 20 + ... + 90)\n\nThe sum of the series 10, 20, ..., 90 is an arithmetic series with first term 10, last term 90, and number of terms 9 (since it's up to 90, which is 9 * 10).\n\nThe sum of that series is:\n\nS = n/2 * (first term + last term) = 9/2 * (10 + 90) = 9/2 * 100 = 450\n\nSo, total widgets = 10 * 100 + 450 = 1000 + 450 = 1450\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series directly, which is what I did earlier.\n\nI think 1450 is definitely the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1450} \\]"
