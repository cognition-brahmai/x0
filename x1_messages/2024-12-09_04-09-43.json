        "content": "So the restaurant is planning a new menu with three types of dishes: appetizers, main courses, and desserts. They're offering six different appetizers, eight different main courses, and four different desserts. The question is asking for the total number of possible meal combinations a customer could choose if they pick one item from each category.\n\nOkay, so to figure this out, I need to think about how many choices there are in total when combining one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert.\n\nFirst, there are six appetizers to choose from. For each appetizer, there are eight different main courses that could be paired with it. So, for each appetizer, there are eight options for the main course. That means the number of combinations for appetizers and main courses alone would be six times eight, which is 48.\n\nNow, for each of those 48 combinations of appetizer and main course, there are four different desserts to choose from. So, for every one of those 48 combinations, there are four dessert options.\n\nTherefore, to find the total number of possible meal combinations, I need to multiply the number of appetizers by the number of main courses by the number of desserts.\n\nSo, that's 6 appetizers times 8 main courses times 4 desserts.\n\nLet me do the math step by step.\n\nFirst, 6 times 8 is 48.\n\nThen, 48 times 4 is 192.\n\nSo, the total number of possible meal combinations is 192.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf there are six appetizers, and for each appetizer, there are eight main courses, that's 6 times 8, which is 48.\n\nThen, for each of those 48 combinations, there are four desserts.\n\nSo, 48 times 4 should indeed be 192.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider each category separately and then combine them.\n\nThe number of choices for appetizers is 6.\n\nThe number of choices for main courses is 8.\n\nThe number of choices for desserts is 4.\n\nWhen choosing one from each category, the total number of combinations is the product of the number of choices in each category.\n\nSo, 6 times 8 times 4 equals 192.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider.\n\nIs there any restriction on certain appetizers not going with certain main courses, or anything like that?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so we can assume that any appetizer can be paired with any main course, and any dessert can be paired with any combination of appetizer and main course.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible meal combinations is indeed 192.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it in terms of permutations, but since the order of selection doesn't matter here\u2014it's just about choosing one from each category\u2014multiplication is the appropriate operation.\n\nSo, final answer: 192 possible meal combinations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192} \\]"
