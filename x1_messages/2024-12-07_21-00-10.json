        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If you invest $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded quarterly, how much money will you have after five years? Alright, let's break this down. I remember that when interest is compounded, it means that the interest earned also earns interest over time, which can make the investment grow faster than with simple interest.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"compounded quarterly\" means. Quarterly means four times a year, so the interest is calculated and added to the principal every three months. The annual interest rate is 4%, but since it's compounded quarterly, I need to find out what the quarterly interest rate is. I think I do this by dividing the annual rate by the number of compounding periods per year. So, 4% divided by 4 would be 1% per quarter.\n\nNow, over five years, there would be 5 times 4, which is 20 quarters. So, the interest is applied 20 times. I need to find out how much the investment grows to after 20 quarters.\n\nI recall there's a formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\nP = $10,000\n\nr = 4% or 0.04\n\nn = 4 (since it's compounded quarterly)\n\nt = 5 years\n\nSo, A = 10000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the quarterly interest rate: 0.04 / 4 = 0.01\n\nThen, add 1 to that: 1 + 0.01 = 1.01\n\nNow, raise that to the power of 20 (since 4 quarters/year * 5 years = 20): 1.01^20\n\nI need to calculate 1.01 to the power of 20. Let's see, 1.01^10 is approximately 1.1046, so 1.01^20 would be about 1.1046^2, which is around 1.2202.\n\nThen, multiply that by the principal: 10000 * 1.2202 = $12,202.\n\nWait, but I think I can get a more precise calculation. Maybe I should use a calculator for this.\n\nLet me use a calculator:\n\nFirst, 0.04 divided by 4 is 0.01.\n\nThen, 1 plus 0.01 is 1.01.\n\nThen, 1.01 to the power of 20 is approximately 1.22019.\n\nFinally, 10000 times 1.22019 is $12,201.90.\n\nSo, after five years, the investment would grow to approximately $12,201.90.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if I did this correctly. Maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the interest earned each quarter and add it to the principal sequentially for each quarter.\n\nStarting with $10,000.\n\nFirst quarter:\n\nInterest = $10,000 * 0.01 = $100.\n\nNew principal = $10,000 + $100 = $10,100.\n\nSecond quarter:\n\nInterest = $10,100 * 0.01 = $101.\n\nNew principal = $10,100 + $101 = $10,201.\n\nThird quarter:\n\nInterest = $10,201 * 0.01 = $102.01.\n\nNew principal = $10,201 + $102.01 = $10,303.01.\n\nAnd so on, for 20 quarters.\n\nThis seems time-consuming, but it should give me the same result as the formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the compound interest formula, which is designed exactly for this purpose.\n\nLet me see if there's any other factor I should consider, like inflation or taxes, but the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I'll assume it's just straightforward compound interest.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the interest rate is indeed 4% per year, compounded quarterly, and that the investment period is exactly five years.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the interest is compounded based on the original principal only, or on the accumulated amount, including previous interest. From my understanding, compound interest means it's compounded on the accumulated amount.\n\nWait a minute, I think there's a difference between simple interest and compound interest. Simple interest is only on the principal, while compound interest is on the principal plus any accumulated interest.\n\nIn this case, since it's compounded quarterly, it's compound interest.\n\nLet me double-check the formula I'm using.\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nYes, that's the standard formula for compound interest.\n\nAlternatively, some people might use A = P(1 + r)^t for simple interest, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, sticking with the compound interest formula.\n\nLet me also consider if the compounding frequency affects the final amount.\n\nI know that the more frequent the compounding, the higher the final amount, all else being equal.\n\nFor example, daily compounding would yield a higher amount than annual compounding.\n\nIn this case, it's quarterly, which is more frequent than annual, so it makes sense that the final amount is higher than with annual compounding.\n\nWait, let me check what the final amount would be with annual compounding.\n\nWith annual compounding, n would be 1.\n\nSo, A = 10000(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*5) = 10000(1.04)^5.\n\nCalculating 1.04^5 is approximately 1.2167.\n\nSo, 10000 * 1.2167 = $12,167.\n\nComparing that to the quarterly compounding result of $12,201.90, it's slightly higher, as expected.\n\nSo, that gives me more confidence that the quarterly compounding should indeed give a higher final amount.\n\nAlternatively, if the compounding was monthly or daily, the final amount would be even higher, but in this problem, it's specifically quarterly.\n\nLet me also consider if there are any additional deposits or withdrawals during the five years. The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume it's a single lump sum investment with no further contributions.\n\nAlright, so proceeding with the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), plugging in the values:\n\nP = 10000\n\nr = 0.04\n\nn = 4\n\nt = 5\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5) = 10000(1 + 0.01)^20 = 10000(1.01)^20.\n\nCalculating (1.01)^20:\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.01^20 is approximately 1.22019.\n\nTherefore, A = 10000 * 1.22019 = $12,201.90.\n\nSo, after five years, the investment would grow to $12,201.90.\n\nWait, but I think it's important to consider the number of decimal places. Let's see:\n\n1.01^20 is actually 1.2201900399, so multiplying by 10000 gives $12,201.900399.\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, it would be $12,201.90.\n\nAlternatively, if we carry more decimal places during the calculation, it might be slightly different.\n\nLet me use a more precise calculation.\n\nCalculating (1 + 0.01)^20:\n\nUsing the formula for compound interest, or using a calculator with higher precision.\n\nI get 1.22019004.\n\nSo, $10,000 * 1.22019004 = $12,201.9004.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, it's $12,201.90.\n\nTherefore, the final amount after five years is $12,201.90.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem requires a different level of precision, I should adjust accordingly, but in general, money is expressed to two decimal places.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any other fee or charge associated with the investment, but again, the problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume it's a straightforward compound interest calculation.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure that the interest rate is fixed over the five years, which is typically the case for fixed-rate investments.\n\nSo, in conclusion, investing $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded quarterly, will grow to $12,201.90 after five years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12201.90} \\]"
