The expression is (4 * 3) - (2^3) + 6 / 2.\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n(4 * 3) = 12\n\n(2^3) = 8\n\n6 / 2 = 3\n\nNow, plug these values back into the expression:\n\n12 - 8 + 3\n\nNext, perform the subtraction and addition from left to right:\n\n12 - 8 = 4\n\n4 + 3 = 7\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7."
