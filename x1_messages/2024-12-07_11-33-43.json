        "content": "Let's see. The store sells oranges in packs of 6 and apples in packs of 4. The customer bought 3 packs of oranges and 2 packs of apples. I need to find out how many individual fruits that totals.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many oranges they got. Since each pack of oranges has 6 oranges, and they bought 3 packs, I can multiply 6 by 3 to find the total number of oranges.\n\n6 oranges/pack \u00d7 3 packs = 18 oranges\n\nNext, for the apples. Each pack has 4 apples, and they bought 2 packs. So, 4 apples/pack \u00d7 2 packs = 8 apples\n\nNow, to find the total number of fruits, I just need to add the oranges and apples together.\n\n18 oranges + 8 apples = 26 fruits\n\nSo, the customer purchased a total of 26 individual fruits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]"
