Scott Fitzgerald, the author of \"The Great Gatsby,\" spent time living in France as part of the expatriate community known as the \"Lost Generation.\" This period was marked by a significant number of American writers and artists living abroad, particularly in Paris, during the interwar years. The term \"Lost Generation\" was coined by Gertrude Stein and popularized by Ernest Hemingway, who was also part of this community. Fitzgerald's time in France influenced his work and personal life, and it was during this period that he continued to write and socialize with other prominent figures of the era."
