        "content": "So, the factory produces 500 units every day, and I need to find out how many units it produces in a non-leap year. First, I need to know how many days are in a non-leap year.\n\nI remember that a non-leap year has 365 days. So, if the factory produces 500 units each day, I can find the total annual production by multiplying the daily production by the number of days in the year.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal units in a year = daily production \u00d7 number of days in a year\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal units = 500 units/day \u00d7 365 days\n\nNow, I need to do the multiplication. Let's see:\n\n500 \u00d7 365\n\nI can break this down to make it easier. I know that 500 \u00d7 300 is 150,000, and 500 \u00d7 65 is 32,500. So, adding those together:\n\n150,000 + 32,500 = 182,500\n\nWait, does that seem right? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 365 as 360 + 5.\n\nSo, 500 \u00d7 360 = 180,000\n\nAnd 500 \u00d7 5 = 2,500\n\nAdding those together gives 182,500.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory produces 182,500 units in a non-leap year.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should confirm the number of days in a non-leap year. I'm confident it's 365, but it's always good to double-check.\n\nI know that a leap year has 366 days, occurring every four years, but in a non-leap year, it's 365 days.\n\nTherefore, my calculation should be accurate.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any days where the factory doesn't operate, like holidays or maintenance days. But the question just says \"every day,\" so I think it's safe to assume it operates every day.\n\nSo, final answer: 182,500 units per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{182500} \\]"
