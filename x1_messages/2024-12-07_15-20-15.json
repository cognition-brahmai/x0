        "content": "I'm trying to figure out this riddle. It says, \"Stealthy as a shadow in the dead of night, cunning but affectionate if given a bite. Never owned but often loved. At my sport considered cruel, but that's because you never know me at all.\" Hmm, let's break it down piece by piece.\n\nFirst, \"stealthy as a shadow in the dead of night.\" That suggests something that moves quietly and is hard to see, maybe like a cat or a mouse. But it could also be something more abstract.\n\nNext, \"cunning but affectionate if given a bite.\" Cunning implies intelligence and perhaps some trickery. Affectionate if given a bite\u2014wait, does that mean if you give it a bite to eat, it becomes affectionate? Or does it mean something else? Maybe \"bite\" here refers to a small amount, like giving it a little attention or a treat.\n\nThen, \"never owned but often loved.\" So, it's something that people don't own, but they still love it. Could be an animal that's wild, like a stray cat or a bird.\n\nFinally, \"at my sport considered cruel, but that's because you never know me at all.\" This part is tricky. \"Sport\" could refer to a pastime or activity. So, maybe this thing has a sport or activity that people think is cruel, but really, it's not once you understand it.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm thinking it might be a fox. Foxes are known for being stealthy and cunning, especially active at night. They can be affectionate if treated kindly, and people often have a love for them even if they're not owned. As for the \"sport\" part, maybe it's referring to fox hunting, which is considered cruel by many, but the riddle suggests that once you understand the fox, it's not as bad.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a cat. Cats are stealthy, cunning, and can be very affectionate, especially if you give them food. They're often loved but not always owned, like stray cats. The \"sport\" could be something like hunting birds, which some people might consider cruel.\n\nWait, but the riddle says \"never owned,\" which might rule out cats since many cats are owned pets. Though there are stray cats that are loved but not owned.\n\nAnother possibility is a wolf. Wolves are stealthy, cunning, and often loved by people, even though they're not owned. There's a lot of folklore and admiration for wolves, but activities like wolf hunting are considered cruel by many.\n\nBut let's think about the \"given a bite\" part. Maybe \"bite\" here doesn't refer to food, but rather, being bitten by it. Like, if it bites you, it becomes affectionate. That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"bite\" means a small amount, as in, if you give it a little affection or attention, it becomes affectionate in return.\n\nConsidering all that, I'm going to guess that the answer is a fox. What do you think?"
