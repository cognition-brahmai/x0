        "content": "So the library starts with 6 shelves, and each shelf holds 30 books. That means initially, the library has 6 shelves times 30 books per shelf, which is 180 books. Then, every month, the library adds 15 more books. We need to find out how many books there will be after 4 months.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the initial number of books:\n\n6 shelves * 30 books per shelf = 180 books.\n\nNext, the library adds 15 books each month. Over 4 months, that's:\n\n15 books/month * 4 months = 60 books.\n\nNow, to find the total number of books after 4 months, I'll add the initial number of books to the books added over 4 months:\n\n180 books + 60 books = 240 books.\n\nSo, after 4 months, the library will have 240 books.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something else to consider. Does the library add books to existing shelves or create new shelves? The problem says each shelf holds 30 books, and they're adding books monthly. It doesn't specify if they're adding shelves or just adding books to existing shelves.\n\nAssuming they're adding books to existing shelves, and shelves can hold more than 30 books, then the calculation stands: 180 initial books plus 60 added books equal 240 books.\n\nHowever, if shelves can only hold 30 books each, and they add books beyond that, they might need to add new shelves. But the problem doesn't mention anything about adding shelves or restricting the number of books per shelf beyond the initial setup.\n\nGiven that, I think the straightforward approach is correct: initial books plus added books equal total books.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the library has a maximum capacity based on shelves, and adding books doesn't increase the shelf count. But again, the problem states that they add 15 books each month, implying that they can accommodate those additional books.\n\nSo, my final answer is 240 books after 4 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
