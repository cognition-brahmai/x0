        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a car traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to find out how far it's gone in total. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find out how far it goes in that time, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nAlright, that makes sense. Now, it travels at another speed for a different amount of time. Specifically, 45 miles per hour for 3 hours. Let's use the same formula for this part:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 45 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 135 miles\n\nOkay, so now I have two distances: 240 miles and 135 miles. To find the total distance traveled, I just need to add these two together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 240 miles + 135 miles = 375 miles\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe combining the speeds or something. Let's see.\n\nTotal time traveled is 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.\n\nIf I try to find an average speed over the entire journey, maybe that could help. But actually, I think that might be more complicated than necessary, since the speeds are different for different periods.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the distances separately, as I did earlier, and just sum them up, which seems straightforward and accurate.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst part: 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles. That seems correct.\n\nSecond part: 45 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 135 miles. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding them up: 240 + 135 = 375 miles. Yeah, that's right.\n\nI don't think I need to consider any other factors here, like acceleration or anything like that, because the problem gives average speeds for each segment of the trip.\n\nSo, the total distance traveled by the car is 375 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]"
