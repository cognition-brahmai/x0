One minute, I'm swinging by to catch up with you, and the next, there's some criminal chaos that needed my immediate attention.\n\nI know, I know, excuses are like, well, you know. But honestly, the city never sleeps, and neither do I. It's not like I can just ignore a bank heist or a runaway train when myResponsibilities call. Superhero stuff, am I right?\n\nAnyway, I wanted to make sure you knew that missing your party wasn't because I didn't care. Far from it! Your birthday is a big deal, and I was really looking forward to catching up and maybe even showing off some sweet web-slinging tricks if the situation called for it.\n\nBut hey, maybe next time, eh? We can have a party where I promise to keep my Spider-Sense tuned into just the festivities. No crime-fighting, no interruptions\u2014just you, me, and a cake that probably wouldn't stand a chance against my sugar cravings.\n\nIn the meantime, I've got a little something for you. It's not much, but I hope it makes up for my absence. It's a photo I took from the top of the Chrysler Building, looking out over the city at sunset. I thought about you while taking it, wondering what kind of adventures we could have together, beyond the superhero stuff.\n\nSo, sorry again for blowing off your party. Know that it was for the greater good, and that I value our friendship more than you'll ever know. Here's to many more birthdays, and maybe one day, I'll actually make it to one without any emergencies popping up.\n\nYour pal,\n\nSpider-Man"
