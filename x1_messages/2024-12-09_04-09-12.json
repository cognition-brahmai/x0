        "content": "No, people generally dream in color. The idea that dreams are only in black and white is a common misconception, likely stemming from early studies on dreaming that suggested a majority of dreams were in black and white. However, more recent research has shown that most people dream in color, and black and white dreams are relatively rare.\n\nIn fact, studies have found that around 12% of people report dreaming only in black and white, while the majority experience\u5f69\u8272 dreams. It's also interesting to note that before color television became widespread, a higher percentage of people reported dreaming in black and white. This suggests that media exposure may influence the way we dream.\n\nSo, to answer your question: no, people do not only dream in black and white; most people dream in color."
