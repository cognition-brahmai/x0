        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says the rectangle has a length of 15 cm and a width of 8 cm. I need to find the area of the rectangle, and then find out what the new area would be if both the length and the width were doubled. Okay, let's start with the first part.\n\nI remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if the length is 15 cm and the width is 8 cm, the area should be 15 times 8. Let me do that multiplication: 15 times 8 is 120. So, the area is 120 square centimeters.\n\nNow, for the second part, I need to find out what happens to the area if both dimensions are doubled. That means the new length would be twice 15 cm, which is 30 cm, and the new width would be twice 8 cm, which is 16 cm. Then, the new area would be 30 times 16. Let's calculate that: 30 times 16 is 480 square centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, I'm thinking about this. Is there a shorter way to figure out what happens to the area when both dimensions are doubled? I recall that area scales with the square of the scaling factor. Since both length and width are being doubled, that's a scaling factor of 2 for each dimension. So, the area should be scaled by 2 times 2, which is 4. That means the new area should be 4 times the original area.\n\nLet's check that. The original area is 120 square centimeters, and 4 times 120 is 480 square centimeters. That matches what I calculated earlier by multiplying the new length and width directly.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like when you double both the length and the width of a rectangle, the area becomes four times the original area.\n\nJust to make sure I understand this concept, let me think of another example. Suppose I have a rectangle with a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm. The area would be 10 times 5, which is 50 square centimeters. If I double both dimensions, the new length is 20 cm and the new width is 10 cm, and the new area would be 20 times 10, which is 200 square centimeters. Again, that's four times the original area, since 4 times 50 is 200. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI think I've got it now. So, for the original problem, the area of the rectangle is 120 square centimeters, and if both dimensions are doubled, the new area would be 480 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the original rectangle is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) square centimeters, and the area of the rectangle with doubled dimensions is \\(\\boxed{480}\\) square centimeters."
