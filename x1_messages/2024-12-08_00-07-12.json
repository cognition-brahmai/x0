        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a party with only chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. It's said that there are twice as many chocolate cupcakes as vanilla ones. Then, 30% of the chocolate cupcakes and 40% of the vanilla cupcakes have been eaten, and after that, there are 42 cupcakes left. We need to find out how many chocolate cupcakes there were originally.\n\nFirst, let's assign some variables to make this easier. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( v \\) represent the number of vanilla cupcakes originally.\n\n- Since there are twice as many chocolate cupcakes as vanilla ones, the number of chocolate cupcakes is \\( 2v \\).\n\nNow, some cupcakes have been eaten:\n\n- 30% of the chocolate cupcakes have been eaten. So, the number of chocolate cupcakes eaten is \\( 0.3 \\times 2v = 0.6v \\).\n\n- 40% of the vanilla cupcakes have been eaten. So, the number of vanilla cupcakes eaten is \\( 0.4v \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of cupcakes left would be:\n\n- Chocolate cupcakes left: \\( 2v - 0.6v = 1.4v \\)\n\n- Vanilla cupcakes left: \\( v - 0.4v = 0.6v \\)\n\nTotal cupcakes left are the sum of the remaining chocolate and vanilla cupcakes:\n\n\\( 1.4v + 0.6v = 2v \\)\n\nBut according to the problem, there are 42 cupcakes left. So:\n\n\\( 2v = 42 \\)\n\nNow, solving for \\( v \\):\n\n\\( v = \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\)\n\nSo, there were originally 21 vanilla cupcakes.\n\nSince there are twice as many chocolate cupcakes as vanilla ones, the number of chocolate cupcakes originally is:\n\n\\( 2v = 2 \\times 21 = 42 \\)\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Vanilla cupcakes originally: 21\n\n- Chocolate cupcakes originally: 42\n\nNow, 30% of chocolate cupcakes eaten: \\( 0.3 \\times 42 = 12.6 \\), but that's not a whole number. Hmm, maybe I should consider that the number of cupcakes should be whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( v \\) = number of vanilla cupcakes originally.\n\n- \\( c = 2v \\) = number of chocolate cupcakes originally.\n\nCupcakes eaten:\n\n- Chocolate eaten: \\( 0.3c = 0.3 \\times 2v = 0.6v \\)\n\n- Vanilla eaten: \\( 0.4v \\)\n\nCupcakes left:\n\n- Chocolate left: \\( c - 0.3c = 0.7c = 0.7 \\times 2v = 1.4v \\)\n\n- Vanilla left: \\( v - 0.4v = 0.6v \\)\n\nTotal cupcakes left: \\( 1.4v + 0.6v = 2v \\)\n\nAccording to the problem, \\( 2v = 42 \\), so \\( v = 21 \\).\n\nThen, \\( c = 2 \\times 21 = 42 \\).\n\nBut earlier, I thought about the 30% of 42 being 12.6, which is not a whole number. Maybe that's the issue. Perhaps the problem implies that the number of cupcakes eaten are whole numbers, suggesting that the original numbers should be such that 30% of chocolate and 40% of vanilla are integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider setting up equations based on the percentages.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( v \\) = number of vanilla cupcakes.\n\n- \\( c = 2v \\) = number of chocolate cupcakes.\n\nAfter eating:\n\n- Chocolate cupcakes left: \\( c - 0.3c = 0.7c \\)\n\n- Vanilla cupcakes left: \\( v - 0.4v = 0.6v \\)\n\nTotal cupcakes left: \\( 0.7c + 0.6v = 42 \\)\n\nBut since \\( c = 2v \\), substitute \\( c \\) in the equation:\n\n\\( 0.7(2v) + 0.6v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( 1.4v + 0.6v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( 2v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( v = 21 \\)\n\nThen, \\( c = 42 \\)\n\nBut again, 30% of 42 is 12.6, which is not a whole number. Maybe the problem allows for fractional cupcakes, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of cupcakes eaten are integers, so the original numbers should be such that 30% of chocolate and 40% of vanilla are integers.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that.\n\nGiven \\( c = 2v \\), and \\( 0.3c \\) and \\( 0.4v \\) should be integers.\n\nSo, \\( 0.3 \\times 2v = 0.6v \\) should be an integer, and \\( 0.4v \\) should be an integer.\n\nThat implies that \\( 0.6v \\) and \\( 0.4v \\) are integers.\n\nSo, \\( v \\) must be a multiple of 5, because 0.4v to be integer implies v is a multiple of 5.\n\nSimilarly, \\( 0.6v \\) being integer also suggests v is a multiple of 5.\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( v = 5k \\), where k is a positive integer.\n\nThen, \\( c = 2v = 10k \\)\n\nNow, cupcakes left:\n\n- Chocolate left: \\( 0.7c = 0.7 \\times 10k = 7k \\)\n\n- Vanilla left: \\( 0.6v = 0.6 \\times 5k = 3k \\)\n\nTotal left: \\( 7k + 3k = 10k = 42 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 10k = 42 \\)\n\nThen, \\( k = 4.2 \\), which is not an integer.\n\nHmm, that\u2019s a problem because \\( k \\) should be an integer.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption that \\( v \\) must be a multiple of 5 might be too restrictive, or perhaps there's a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require the number of cupcakes eaten to be integers, and fractional cupcakes are acceptable.\n\nIn that case, the earlier calculation stands: \\( v = 21 \\), \\( c = 42 \\).\n\nBut again, 30% of 42 is 12.6, which is odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the total original cupcakes are such that after eating the specified percentages, the remaining are 42, and perhaps the original numbers must be integers, but the eaten amounts don't have to be.\n\nBut typically, in such problems, it's assumed that the number of items are whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up the problem with equations and solve for integer values.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nLet \\( v \\) be the number of vanilla cupcakes, and \\( c = 2v \\) be the number of chocolate cupcakes.\n\nAfter eating:\n\n- Chocolate left: \\( c - 0.3c = 0.7c \\)\n\n- Vanilla left: \\( v - 0.4v = 0.6v \\)\n\nTotal left: \\( 0.7c + 0.6v = 42 \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( c = 2v \\):\n\n\\( 0.7(2v) + 0.6v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( 1.4v + 0.6v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( 2v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( v = 21 \\)\n\n\\( c = 42 \\)\n\nBut as before, 30% of 42 is 12.6, which is not an integer.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to round or consider that cupcakes can be divided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the setup.\n\nLet me consider that perhaps the percentages are meant to be fractions.\n\n30% is 3/10, and 40% is 4/10 or 2/5.\n\nSo, let's try using fractions instead of decimals.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Chocolate cupcakes left: \\( c - \\frac{3}{10}c = \\frac{7}{10}c \\)\n\n- Vanilla cupcakes left: \\( v - \\frac{2}{5}v = \\frac{3}{5}v \\)\n\nTotal left: \\( \\frac{7}{10}c + \\frac{3}{5}v = 42 \\)\n\nAnd since \\( c = 2v \\), substitute:\n\n\\( \\frac{7}{10}(2v) + \\frac{3}{5}v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{14}{10}v + \\frac{3}{5}v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{7}{5}v + \\frac{3}{5}v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{10}{5}v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( 2v = 42 \\)\n\n\\( v = 21 \\)\n\n\\( c = 42 \\)\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nPerhaps the answer is indeed 42 chocolate cupcakes originally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the total cupcakes originally.\n\nTotal original cupcakes: \\( c + v = 2v + v = 3v \\)\n\nCupcakes eaten:\n\n- Chocolate eaten: \\( 0.3c = 0.6v \\)\n\n- Vanilla eaten: \\( 0.4v \\)\n\nTotal eaten: \\( 0.6v + 0.4v = v \\)\n\nTherefore, cupcakes left: \\( 3v - v = 2v \\)\n\nGiven that \\( 2v = 42 \\), then \\( v = 21 \\), and \\( c = 42 \\).\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n\"At a party, there are only chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. There are twice as many chocolate cupcakes as vanilla cupcakes. If 30% of the chocolate cupcakes and 40% of the vanilla cupcakes have been eaten, there are now 42 cupcakes left. How many chocolate cupcakes were there originally?\"\n\nEverything seems to point to \\( c = 42 \\), but the 30% of 42 being 12.6 is odd.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to accept fractional cupcakes or perhaps it's assumed that the percentages result in whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the percentages are not exact, and fractional cupcakes are acceptable.\n\nIn that case, the answer is \\( c = 42 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps it's expected to round the numbers.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with the calculation that the original number of chocolate cupcakes is 42.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]"
