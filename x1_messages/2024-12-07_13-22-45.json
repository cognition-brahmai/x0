        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, there are 8 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many handshakes one person makes. If there are 8 people, then each person shakes hands with 7 others, right? Because they don't shake their own hand. So, if each of the 8 people shakes hands with 7 others, that would be 8 times 7, which is 56 handshakes.\n\nBut wait, that seems too high. I think I'm double-counting here. Because when person A shakes hands with person B, that's the same as person B shaking hands with person A. So, in my initial calculation, I'm counting each handshake twice\u2014once for each person involved.\n\nTo correct for that, I need to divide the total by 2. So, 56 divided by 2 equals 28. Maybe the answer is 28 handshakes.\n\nLet me think of another way to approach this. Maybe I can use combinations. I remember that combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which seems to be the case here since a handshake between A and B is the same as between B and A.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 8 (people), and k is 2 (since a handshake involves 2 people).\n\nSo, C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6!) = (8 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 56 / 2 = 28.\n\nAgain, I get 28 handshakes.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe I can list out the handshakes for a smaller number of people and see if there's a pattern.\n\nLet's say there are 3 people: A, B, and C.\n\nPossible handshakes:\n\nA-B\n\nA-C\n\nB-C\n\nThat's 3 handshakes.\n\nNow, for 4 people: A, B, C, D.\n\nPossible handshakes:\n\nA-B\n\nA-C\n\nA-D\n\nB-C\n\nB-D\n\nC-D\n\nThat's 6 handshakes.\n\nWait, is there a pattern here? For 3 people, 3 handshakes; for 4 people, 6 handshakes; for 5 people, let's see:\n\nA-B\n\nA-C\n\nA-D\n\nA-E\n\nB-C\n\nB-D\n\nB-E\n\nC-D\n\nC-E\n\nD-E\n\nThat's 10 handshakes.\n\nSo, for 3 people: 3 handshakes\n\n4 people: 6 handshakes\n\n5 people: 10 handshakes\n\n6 people: Let's try to list them.\n\nA-B\n\nA-C\n\nA-D\n\nA-E\n\nA-F\n\nB-C\n\nB-D\n\nB-E\n\nB-F\n\nC-D\n\nC-E\n\nC-F\n\nD-E\n\nD-F\n\nE-F\n\nThat's 15 handshakes.\n\nI notice that each time, the number of handshakes increases by one less than the previous increase.\n\nFor example:\n\nFrom 3 to 4 people: 3 to 6 (increase by 3)\n\nFrom 4 to 5 people: 6 to 10 (increase by 4)\n\nFrom 5 to 6 people: 10 to 15 (increase by 5)\n\nSo, for 7 people, it should be 15 + 6 = 21 handshakes.\n\nAnd for 8 people, 21 + 7 = 28 handshakes.\n\nAgain, I get 28 handshakes.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using the concept of graph theory, where each person is a vertex, and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices. In this case, the number of handshakes would be equal to the number of edges in a complete graph with 8 vertices.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=8, it's 8*7/2 = 56/2 = 28.\n\nOnce again, 28 handshakes.\n\nIs there any other way to think about this that might give a different answer? Maybe considering that some people might not shake hands with each other, but the problem says \"each person shakes hands with every other person once,\" so I think it's safe to assume that all handshakes occur.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a recursive way to think about this. Let's say with 1 person, 0 handshakes. With 2 people, 1 handshake. With 3 people, the third person shakes hands with 2 others, so total handshakes are 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nWith 4 people, the fourth person shakes hands with 3 others, so total handshakes are 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nWith 5 people, the fifth person shakes hands with 4 others, so total handshakes are 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\n6 people: 10 + 5 = 15\n\n7 people: 15 + 6 = 21\n\n8 people: 21 + 7 = 28\n\nAgain, 28 handshakes.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles\u2014using simple multiplication and division, combinations, listing out possibilities, graph theory, and recursion\u2014and each method leads me to the same answer: 28 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 28 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
