        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about planning a sports complex with a budget of $10 million. The complex includes a soccer field, basketball courts, and a swimming pool. The budget allocations are 40% for the soccer field, 30% for the basketball courts, and the remaining amount for the swimming pool. There are also additional costs for landscaping and contingency funds to consider.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial allocations and then account for the extra expenses. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the initial allocations for each facility.\n\nThe total budget is $10 million.\n\n- Soccer field: 40% of $10 million\n\n- Basketball courts: 30% of $10 million\n\n- Swimming pool: remaining amount after soccer field and basketball courts\n\nBut wait, the problem says the remaining amount after soccer field and basketball courts is for the swimming pool, but then there are additional costs for landscaping and contingency funds. So, I need to make sure I understand how these additional costs are being factored in.\n\nStep 2: Determine how the remaining budget is allocated.\n\nFirst, calculate the allocations for the soccer field and basketball courts:\n\nSoccer field: 40% of $10 million = 0.40 * 10,000,000 = $4,000,000\n\nBasketball courts: 30% of $10 million = 0.30 * 10,000,000 = $3,000,000\n\nTotal allocated so far: $4,000,000 + $3,000,000 = $7,000,000\n\nRemaining budget: $10,000,000 - $7,000,000 = $3,000,000\n\nThis remaining $3,000,000 is initially allocated for the swimming pool, but we have to account for additional costs for landscaping and contingency funds.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the additional costs.\n\nLandscaping: 5% of the total budget\n\nContingency funds: 10% of the total budget\n\nFirst, calculate landscaping cost:\n\n5% of $10,000,000 = 0.05 * 10,000,000 = $500,000\n\nNext, calculate contingency funds:\n\n10% of $10,000,000 = 0.10 * 10,000,000 = $1,000,000\n\nTotal additional costs: $500,000 (landscaping) + $1,000,000 (contingency) = $1,500,000\n\nStep 4: Adjust the initial allocations to account for additional costs.\n\nThe initial remaining budget after allocating to soccer field and basketball courts is $3,000,000, which was intended for the swimming pool. However, we have additional costs of $1,500,000 for landscaping and contingency funds.\n\nSo, the actual amount available for the swimming pool would be the remaining budget minus the additional costs.\n\nSwimming pool budget: $3,000,000 - $1,500,000 = $1,500,000\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. Let me double-check.\n\nTotal budget: $10,000,000\n\nAllocated to soccer field: $4,000,000\n\nAllocated to basketball courts: $3,000,000\n\nRemaining for swimming pool: $3,000,000\n\nAdditional costs: $1,500,000\n\nBut if we subtract the additional costs from the swimming pool budget, the swimming pool would only get $1,500,000. Is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the additional costs are on top of the initial allocations.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nStep 5: Consider if additional costs are included within the total budget.\n\nThe total budget is $10 million, which includes everything: soccer field, basketball courts, swimming pool, landscaping, and contingency funds.\n\nSo, total budget = soccer field + basketball courts + swimming pool + landscaping + contingency funds\n\nWe know:\n\n- Soccer field: 40% of $10 million = $4,000,000\n\n- Basketball courts: 30% of $10 million = $3,000,000\n\n- Landscaping: 5% of $10 million = $500,000\n\n- Contingency funds: 10% of $10 million = $1,000,000\n\nSo, the sum of these allocations is:\n\n$4,000,000 + $3,000,000 + $500,000 + $1,000,000 = $8,500,000\n\nTherefore, the remaining amount for the swimming pool is:\n\nTotal budget - (soccer field + basketball courts + landscaping + contingency funds) = $10,000,000 - $8,500,000 = $1,500,000\n\nSo, the swimming pool budget is $1,500,000.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the remaining amount for the swimming pool,\" which is after allocating for soccer field and basketball courts. Then, additional costs are landscaping and contingency funds.\n\nBut in this calculation, I've included landscaping and contingency funds separately, and the remaining amount goes to the swimming pool.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial allocations for soccer field and basketball courts are out of the total budget, and then the remaining budget is allocated to swimming pool, landscaping, and contingency funds.\n\nStep 6: Consider an alternative allocation approach.\n\nLet's assume that 40% is for soccer field and 30% for basketball courts, totaling 70% of the budget.\n\nRemaining budget: 100% - 70% = 30% of $10 million = $3,000,000\n\nOut of this remaining $3,000,000, part of it is for the swimming pool, and part is for landscaping and contingency funds.\n\nThe problem states that landscaping is 5% of the total budget and contingency funds are 10% of the total budget.\n\nSo, landscaping: 5% of $10 million = $500,000\n\nContingency funds: 10% of $10 million = $1,000,000\n\nTotal additional costs: $500,000 + $1,000,000 = $1,500,000\n\nTherefore, the swimming pool budget would be the remaining budget after allocating to soccer field, basketball courts, landscaping, and contingency funds.\n\nSwimming pool budget: $3,000,000 - $1,500,000 = $1,500,000\n\nThis matches the previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the landscaping and contingency funds are included within the initial allocations, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems the swimming pool budget is $1,500,000.\n\nStep 7: Summarize the individual budgets.\n\n- Soccer field: $4,000,000\n\n- Basketball courts: $3,000,000\n\n- Swimming pool: $1,500,000\n\n- Landscaping: $500,000\n\n- Contingency funds: $1,000,000\n\nTotal: $4,000,000 + $3,000,000 + $1,500,000 + $500,000 + $1,000,000 = $10,000,000\n\nThis adds up correctly to the total budget.\n\nTherefore, the individual budgets are:\n\n- Soccer field: $4,000,000\n\n- Basketball courts: $3,000,000\n\n- Swimming pool: $1,500,000\n\nAdditionally, there are $500,000 for landscaping and $1,000,000 for contingency funds.\n\nHowever, the problem specifically asks for the individual budgets for each facility, considering additional costs such as landscaping and contingency funds.\n\nSince landscaping and contingency funds are separate from the facility budgets, but they are part of the total budget, the facility budgets are as calculated above.\n\nBut perhaps the swimming pool budget should include its own landscaping and contingency funds.\n\nStep 8: Consider if landscaping and contingency funds are allocated proportionally to each facility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the landscaping and contingency funds are allocated proportionally to each facility based on their initial allocations.\n\nLet's explore this possibility.\n\nIf landscaping and contingency funds are allocated proportionally:\n\nFirst, calculate the total percentage allocated to facilities:\n\nSoccer field: 40%\n\nBasketball courts: 30%\n\nSwimming pool: 30% (since remaining 30%)\n\nThen, allocate landscaping and contingency funds based on these percentages.\n\nBut actually, the problem specifies that landscaping is 5% of the total budget and contingency is 10% of the total budget, regardless of the facility allocations.\n\nTherefore, it's more straightforward to consider landscaping and contingency funds as separate line items in the budget, not directly tied to the individual facilities.\n\nThus, the initial calculations stand:\n\n- Soccer field: $4,000,000\n\n- Basketball courts: $3,000,000\n\n- Swimming pool: $1,500,000\n\n- Landscaping: $500,000\n\n- Contingency funds: $1,000,000\n\nTotal: $10,000,000\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swimming pool should have its own contingency fund or landscaping component, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the above allocation is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the individual budgets for each facility, considering the additional costs, are:\n\n- Soccer field: $4,000,000\n\n- Basketball courts: $3,000,000\n\n- Swimming pool: $1,500,000\n\nWith an additional $500,000 for landscaping and $1,000,000 for contingency funds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Soccer field: } \\$4,000,000,\\ \\text{Basketball courts: } \\$3,000,000,\\ \\text{Swimming pool: } \\$1,500,000} \\]"
