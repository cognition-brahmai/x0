        "content": "Let's see. I have this probability problem here. There are 10 red balls, 20 blue balls, and 30 green balls in a box, making a total of 60 balls. I need to find the probability of picking a red ball after already picking two other balls without replacement.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"picking two other balls\" means. Since there are red, blue, and green balls, \"other\" probably refers to balls that are not red. So, picking two balls that are either blue or green, and then picking a red one.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"after picking two other balls,\" but it doesn't specify that those two balls are not red. If it's without replacement, each pick affects the probabilities of the next picks.\n\nMaybe I should think of it as picking three balls in sequence without replacement, and I want the probability that the third ball is red, given that the first two can be any balls except red, or maybe without any specifications.\n\nHmm, the problem says \"after picking two other balls.\" If \"other\" means not red, then the first two picks are blue or green, and the third is red.\n\nAlternatively, if \"other\" just means any ball that's not specified, then it could include red as well.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"what is the probability that you will pick a red ball after picking two other balls?\"\n\nI think \"other balls\" likely means balls that are not red. So, the first two picks are blue or green, and the third is red.\n\nSo, the sequence is: two non-red balls followed by one red ball.\n\nGiven that, the total number of non-red balls is 20 blue + 30 green = 50 balls.\n\nTotal balls initially: 60.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two non-red balls followed by one red ball, without replacement.\n\nLet's calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a non-red ball on the first pick:\n\nNumber of non-red balls: 50\n\nTotal balls: 60\n\nSo, P(first ball is not red) = 50/60 = 5/6\n\nNow, given that the first ball was not red, there are now 49 non-red balls and 10 red balls left, total of 59 balls.\n\nSo, P(second ball is not red | first ball was not red) = 49/59\n\nThen, after picking two non-red balls, there are now 10 red balls and 48 non-red balls left, total of 58 balls.\n\nSo, P(third ball is red | first two were not red) = 10/58 = 5/29\n\nNow, the overall probability is the product of these probabilities:\n\nP = (5/6) * (49/59) * (5/29)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, (5/6) * (49/59) = (5*49)/(6*59) = 245 / 354\n\nThen, (245 / 354) * (5/29) = (245 * 5) / (354 * 29) = 1225 / 10266\n\nNow, I can simplify that fraction.\n\nLet's see, what's the greatest common divisor of 1225 and 10266.\n\nFirst, factor 1225: 1225 = 25 * 49 = 5^2 * 7^2\n\nNow, 10266 divided by 7: 10266 / 7 = 1466.571, not an integer, so 7 doesn't divide 10266.\n\nWait, maybe I should check 1225 divided by 5 is 245, and 245 divided by 5 is 49, and 49 divided by 7 is 7.\n\nSo, 1225 = 5^2 * 7^2\n\nNow, check if 10266 is divisible by 5 or 7.\n\n10266 divided by 5: doesn't end with 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.\n\n10266 divided by 7: 7*1466 = 10262, which is 4 less than 10266, so not exactly divisible.\n\nTherefore, no common factors, so the fraction is already in simplest form: 1225/10266\n\nBut maybe I can leave it as is, or perhaps convert it to a decimal for better understanding.\n\nLet me calculate 1225 divided by 10266.\n\nUsing a calculator, 1225 / 10266 \u2248 0.1193\n\nSo, approximately 0.1193, or 11.93%.\n\nAlternatively, I can keep it as a fraction, but 1225/10266 seems a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify it further by dividing numerator and denominator by something, but as I saw, there are no common factors.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the multiplication:\n\n(5/6) * (49/59) * (5/29) = (5*49*5) / (6*59*29) = 1225 / 10266\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can leave it as 1225/10266, but perhaps the problem expects a decimal approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps \"after picking two other balls\" doesn't necessarily mean that the first two are not red. Maybe it just means picking any two balls first, and then picking a red one.\n\nIf that's the case, then the probability would be different.\n\nLet me reconsider.\n\nAlternative interpretation: \"after picking two other balls\" means picking any two balls first, regardless of their color, and then picking a red one.\n\nIf that's the case, then the probability would be the same as picking a red ball on any specific draw without considering the previous picks, because without replacement, the probability changes based on previous picks.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf we pick three balls in sequence without replacement, the probability that the third ball is red, given that the first two have been picked.\n\nBut, without specifying what the first two are, it's different from the previous interpretation where I assumed the first two are not red.\n\nMaybe I need to consider all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the probability that the third ball picked is red, given that the first two picks are not red.\n\nWait, but that's what I already calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the probability that after picking two balls, the next ball is red.\n\nIf that's the case, then it's similar to what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is ambiguous.\n\nLet me look back at the problem statement: \"what is the probability that you will pick a red ball after picking two other balls?\"\n\nI think the interpretation is that you pick two balls first, and then pick a third one, which should be red.\n\nIf \"other balls\" means balls that are not red, then the first two are not red, and the third is red.\n\nThat's what I calculated earlier: (50/60) * (49/59) * (10/58) = 1225/10266 \u2248 0.1193\n\nAlternatively, if \"other balls\" just means any balls, regardless of color, then the first two can be any balls, and the third is red.\n\nIn that case, the probability that the third ball is red, without any conditions on the first two.\n\nIn this scenario, the probability is simply 10/60 = 1/6 \u2248 0.1667, because without specifying the colors of the first two balls, every ball has an equal chance of being red at any position.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nLet me think carefully.\n\nIn a sequence of picks without replacement, the probability that any specific position is red is the same, assuming no information about previous picks.\n\nSo, in a sequence of three picks, the probability that the third pick is red is 10/60 = 1/6.\n\nBut, in this problem, it says \"after picking two other balls,\" which might imply that the first two are not red, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's just saying that you pick two balls first, and then pick a third one, which should be red, without specifying the colors of the first two.\n\nIn that case, the probability that the third ball is red is indeed 10/60 = 1/6.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated it under the assumption that the first two are not red.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider both scenarios.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is ambiguous, and I need to clarify what \"other balls\" means.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"other balls\" means balls that are not red, and I need to find the probability that the third ball is red given that the first two were not red.\n\nIn that case, it's a conditional probability.\n\nWait, but that's what I already calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the probability of picking a red ball on the third pick, given that the first two picks were not red.\n\nAgain, that's the same as what I calculated.\n\nWait, but in probability terms, \"after picking two other balls\" likely means that the first two picks were not red, and now I'm picking the third one, which should be red.\n\nIn that case, it's a conditional probability: P(third is red | first two are not red).\n\nWhich is exactly what I calculated earlier: (50/60) * (49/59) * (10/58)\n\nWait, no, that's the probability of all three events happening in sequence: first two not red, and third red.\n\nBut the conditional probability P(third is red | first two are not red) is P(all three events) / P(first two are not red).\n\nWait, let's recall the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nHere, A is \"third is red,\" and B is \"first two are not red.\"\n\nSo, P(third is red | first two are not red) = P(first two are not red and third is red) / P(first two are not red)\n\nI already calculated P(first two are not red and third is red) = (50/60)*(49/59)*(10/58)\n\nNow, P(first two are not red) = (50/60)*(49/59)\n\nSo, P(third is red | first two are not red) = [(50/60)*(49/59)*(10/58)] / [(50/60)*(49/59)] = 10/58 = 5/29\n\nAh, so the probability that the third ball is red, given that the first two were not red, is 10/58 = 5/29.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if \"after picking two other balls\" means picking any two balls first, regardless of their color, then the probability that the third ball is red is simply 10/60 = 1/6.\n\nBut given the wording, I think the first interpretation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/29, which is approximately 0.1724 or 17.24%.\n\nAlternatively, as a decimal: approximately 0.1724\n\nOr, as a fraction: 5/29\n\nI think the fraction form is more precise, so I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{29}} \\]"
