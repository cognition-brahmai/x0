        "content": "Given the user's requirement to filter out rows from a CSV where the 'status' column has the value 'inactive', I need to select the most appropriate function from the provided options. The available functions are `csv_analytics` and `document_search`.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the `csv_analytics` function. Its description indicates that it's useful for performing various aggregations, counts, and other operations on CSV data. The parameters it accepts include `action`, which specifies the operation to perform, such as \"count\", \"filter\", \"grouped_count\", etc., and `filters`, which can be used to specify columns, explicit values, or expressions for filtering the data.\n\nGiven that the user wants to filter rows based on the value of the 'status' column, the `csv_analytics` function seems directly applicable. Specifically, the \"filter\" action would be appropriate here, as it allows selecting rows that meet certain criteria.\n\nOn the other hand, the `document_search` function is described as useful for finding specific documents by converting the input query into a series of search terms and filters. Its parameters include `keywords` and `date_range`, which suggest it's more suited for searching through documents based on textual keywords and date constraints.\n\nGiven that the user's requirement is specifically about filtering rows in a CSV based on a column value, `document_search` does not seem as directly applicable as `csv_analytics`.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the `csv_analytics` function with the \"filter\" action, specifying the 'status' column and the value 'inactive' for filtering.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo filter out rows from the CSV where the 'status' column has the value 'inactive', we can use the `csv_analytics` function with the following parameters:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"csv_analytics\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"action\": \"filter\",\n    \"filters\": {\n      \"column\": \"status\",\n      \"value\": \"inactive\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"
