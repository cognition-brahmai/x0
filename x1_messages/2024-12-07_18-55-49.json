        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a box with red balls and green balls. The probability of drawing a red ball is 1/3, and there are 36 balls in total. I need to find out how many are green. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the probability of drawing a red ball is 1/3, and the total number of balls is 36. So, if P(red) = number of red balls / total number of balls, then:\n\nP(red) = number of red balls / 36\n\nAnd we're told that P(red) = 1/3. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nnumber of red balls / 36 = 1/3\n\nNow, I need to solve for the number of red balls. To do that, I can cross-multiply:\n\nnumber of red balls = (1/3) * 36\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(1/3) * 36 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 red balls in the box.\n\nNow, since the box contains only red and green balls, the rest must be green. So, to find the number of green balls, I can subtract the number of red balls from the total number of balls:\n\nnumber of green balls = total number of balls - number of red balls\n\nnumber of green balls = 36 - 12\n\nnumber of green balls = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 green balls in the box.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 12 red balls and 24 green balls, that adds up to 36, which matches the total. And the probability of drawing a red ball would be 12/36, which simplifies to 1/3, which matches the given probability. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using the probability of drawing a green ball. Let's see.\n\nI know that the probability of drawing a red ball is 1/3, and since there are only red and green balls, the probability of drawing a green ball must be 1 - P(red).\n\nSo, P(green) = 1 - P(red) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\nNow, if P(green) = number of green balls / total number of balls, then:\n\n2/3 = number of green balls / 36\n\nAgain, solving for the number of green balls:\n\nnumber of green balls = (2/3) * 36 = 24\n\nSo, again, I get 24 green balls, which matches my earlier result. Good, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any other factors at play here. For example, are the balls being drawn with or without replacement? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's just asking for the probability of drawing one ball, it's probably without replacement, and in this case, it doesn't make a difference.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"drawing\" a ball, which implies a random selection, so we can assume that each ball has an equal chance of being drawn, which is consistent with the probability calculation we did.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? Well, maybe if there were different sizes or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I don't think so.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 24 green balls in the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
