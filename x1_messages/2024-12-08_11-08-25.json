It has also observed Jupiter's auroras and the structure of its atmosphere.\n\n**Saturn:**\n\n- **Size:** Saturn has a diameter of about 116,460 kilometers.\n\n- **Composition:** It is also a gas giant, mostly composed of hydrogen and helium.\n\n- **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's, with hydrogen and helium, and traces of ammonia, methane, and water ice.\n\n- **Unique Features:** It is known for its prominent ring system, composed of countless small particles, ranging from micrometers to meters in size, that orbit the planet.\n\n- **Significant Discoveries:** NASA's Cassini-Huygens mission revealed complex organic chemistry in the rings and the moon Enceladus has geysers that\u55b7\u5c04water vapor and organic particles, suggesting a subsurface ocean with hydrothermal activity.\n\n**Uranus:**\n\n- **Size:** Uranus has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers.\n\n- **Composition:** It is an ice giant, composed mostly of heavier elements like water, ammonia, and methane ice, with a small rocky core.\n\n- **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it its blue color.\n\n- **Unique Features:** Uranus rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of 98 degrees, likely due to a collision with another celestial body in the past.\n\n- **Significant Discoverings:** NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus, providing data on its atmosphere, magnetic field, and rings.\n\n**Neptune:**\n\n- **Size:** Neptune has a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers.\n\n- **Composition:** It is also an ice giant, similar to Uranus, with a composition of water, ammonia, and methane ices, and a small rocky core.\n\n- **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it its blue color.\n\n- **Unique Features:** Neptune has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour.\n\n- **Significant Discoveries:** Voyager 2's flyby revealed the Great Dark Spot, a storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, and the detection of geysers on its moon Triton.\n\nEach of these planets has been explored to varying
