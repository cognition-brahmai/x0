        "content": "Laser originally stands for \"Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\". This term was coined by Gordon Gould, an American physicist, in 1957. The laser is a device that produces a narrow, intense beam of light of a single wavelength by stimulating emission of radiant energy from matter excited to a higher energy state."
