        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a train travels from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 kilometers per hour, and the distance between the two cities is 360 kilometers. I need to find out how many minutes it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.\n\nOkay, so first, I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. That's a basic formula: t = d / s. Here, the distance d is 360 kilometers, and the speed s is 60 kilometers per hour.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, t = 360 km / 60 km/h. That should give me the time in hours.\n\nLet me do the division: 360 divided by 60 is 6. So, the time is 6 hours.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes, not in hours. I need to convert hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to find the total minutes, I should multiply the number of hours by 60.\n\nSo, 6 hours times 60 minutes per hour is 360 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes 360 minutes for the train to travel from City A to City B.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can consider the speed in kilometers per minute instead of per hour.\n\nLet's see, the speed is 60 kilometers per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in one minute, the train travels 60 km / 60 min = 1 kilometer per minute.\n\nSo, if the train travels 1 kilometer every minute, then for 360 kilometers, it would take 360 minutes.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula time = distance / speed, but make sure to have consistent units. Since the speed is in kilometers per hour and the distance is in kilometers, the time will be in hours. Then, convert that time to minutes.\n\nOr, I could convert the speed to kilometers per minute from the beginning.\n\nBut whatever method I use, it seems like the answer is 360 minutes.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
