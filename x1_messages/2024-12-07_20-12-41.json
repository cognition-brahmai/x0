        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem. So, we have a box with red balls and blue balls, and when you pick two balls at random without putting them back, the probability of getting one red and one blue ball is 0.5. We need to find out what the total number of balls could be.\n\nFirst, let's denote some variables to make this easier. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- \\( r \\) is the number of red balls.\n\n- \\( b \\) is the number of blue balls.\n\n- \\( t = r + b \\) is the total number of balls.\n\nThe problem is asking for possible values of \\( t \\) such that the probability of drawing one red and one blue ball is 0.5.\n\nNow, when we draw two balls without replacement, there are a few ways to approach this. One way is to consider the different sequences in which we can draw one red and one blue ball: first red then blue, or first blue then red.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the probability for each sequence and then add them up.\n\n1. Probability of first ball being red and the second being blue:\n\n- The probability of the first ball being red is \\( \\frac{r}{t} \\).\n\n- After removing one red ball, there are now \\( t - 1 \\) balls left, including \\( b \\) blue balls.\n\n- So, the probability of the second ball being blue is \\( \\frac{b}{t - 1} \\).\n\n- Therefore, the combined probability for this sequence is \\( \\frac{r}{t} \\times \\frac{b}{t - 1} \\).\n\n2. Probability of first ball being blue and the second being red:\n\n- The probability of the first ball being blue is \\( \\frac{b}{t} \\).\n\n- After removing one blue ball, there are now \\( t - 1 \\) balls left, including \\( r \\) red balls.\n\n- So, the probability of the second ball being red is \\( \\frac{r}{t - 1} \\).\n\n- Therefore, the combined probability for this sequence is \\( \\frac{b}{t} \\times \\frac{r}{t - 1} \\).\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events, we can add their probabilities to get the total probability of drawing one red and one blue ball:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{one red and one blue}) = \\frac{r}{t} \\times \\frac{b}{t - 1} + \\frac{b}{t} \\times \\frac{r}{t - 1} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{r}{t} \\times \\frac{b}{t - 1} \\right) \\]\n\nWe are told that this probability is 0.5:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{r}{t} \\times \\frac{b}{t - 1} \\right) = 0.5 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify this equation further:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2rb}{t(t - 1)} = 0.5 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( t(t - 1) \\):\n\n\\[ 2rb = 0.5 \\times t(t - 1) \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ rb = \\frac{0.5}{2} \\times t(t - 1) \\]\n\n\\[ rb = \\frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25 \\times t(t - 1) \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that step.\n\nActually, from:\n\n\\[ 2rb = 0.5 \\times t(t - 1) \\]\n\nWe can divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ rb = \\frac{0.5}{2} \\times t(t - 1) \\]\n\n\\[ rb = 0.25 \\times t(t - 1) \\]\n\nBut perhaps it's better to avoid decimals. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ 2rb = 0.5 \\times t(t - 1) \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ 4rb = t(t - 1) \\]\n\nThat looks better. So, we have:\n\n\\[ 4rb = t(t - 1) \\]\n\nNow, recall that \\( t = r + b \\). We can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( t \\) and \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ b = t - r \\]\n\nSubstitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[ 4r(t - r) = t(t - 1) \\]\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n\\[ 4rt - 4r^2 = t^2 - t \\]\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ 4rt - 4r^2 - t^2 + t = 0 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange the terms:\n\n\\[ -4r^2 + 4rt - t^2 + t = 0 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:\n\n\\[ 4r^2 - 4rt + t^2 - t = 0 \\]\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( r \\). We can try to solve for \\( r \\) in terms of \\( t \\), but it might be complicated. Alternatively, since we're looking for integer values of \\( t \\), \\( r \\), and \\( b \\), perhaps we can look for integer solutions.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that \\( t \\) and \\( r \\) are positive integers, and \\( b = t - r \\) is also a positive integer. So, \\( t > r \\) and \\( t > b \\).\n\nLooking back at the equation:\n\n\\[ 4r^2 - 4rt + t^2 - t = 0 \\]\n\nThis looks similar to a perfect square. Let\u2019s see:\n\nNotice that \\( (2r - t)^2 = 4r^2 - 4rt + t^2 \\). So, our equation becomes:\n\n\\[ (2r - t)^2 - t = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ (2r - t)^2 = t \\]\n\nThis is interesting. So, \\( t \\) must be a perfect square because it\u2019s equal to the square of an integer, specifically \\( 2r - t \\).\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( k = 2r - t \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer, and \\( k^2 = t \\).\n\nSo, \\( t = k^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nNow, since \\( t = k^2 \\), and \\( t = r + b \\), and \\( r = \\frac{t + k}{2} \\), let\u2019s solve for \\( r \\).\n\nFrom \\( k = 2r - t \\), we can solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ 2r = t + k \\]\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{t + k}{2} \\]\n\nBut since \\( t = k^2 \\), substitute:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{k^2 + k}{2} \\]\n\nSimilarly, \\( b = t - r = k^2 - \\frac{k^2 + k}{2} = \\frac{2k^2 - k^2 - k}{2} = \\frac{k^2 - k}{2} \\)\n\nNow, since \\( r \\) and \\( b \\) must be positive integers, \\( \\frac{k^2 + k}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{k^2 - k}{2} \\) must be integers.\n\nThis implies that \\( k^2 + k \\) and \\( k^2 - k \\) must be even, which is true if \\( k \\) is an integer because \\( k(k + 1) \\) is always even.\n\nSo, for any positive integer \\( k \\), \\( t = k^2 \\), \\( r = \\frac{k^2 + k}{2} \\), and \\( b = \\frac{k^2 - k}{2} \\) will satisfy the original probability condition.\n\nLet\u2019s check this with small values of \\( k \\):\n\n1. For \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n- \\( t = 1^2 = 1 \\)\n\n- \\( r = \\frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1 \\)\n\n- \\( b = \\frac{1 - 1}{2} = 0 \\)\n\nBut \\( b = 0 \\), which means no blue balls, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem since we're dealing with both red and blue balls. So, \\( k = 1 \\) is not valid.\n\n2. For \\( k = 2 \\):\n\n- \\( t = 4 \\)\n\n- \\( r = \\frac{4 + 2}{2} = 3 \\)\n\n- \\( b = \\frac{4 - 2}{2} = 1 \\)\n\nLet\u2019s verify the probability:\n\n- Total ways to pick 2 balls: \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\)\n\n- Ways to pick one red and one blue: \\( 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\)\n\n- Probability: \\( \\frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \\), which matches the condition.\n\n3. For \\( k = 3 \\):\n\n- \\( t = 9 \\)\n\n- \\( r = \\frac{9 + 3}{2} = 6 \\)\n\n- \\( b = \\frac{9 - 3}{2} = 3 \\)\n\n- Total ways to pick 2 balls: \\( \\binom{9}{2} = 36 \\)\n\n- Ways to pick one red and one blue: \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\)\n\n- Probability: \\( \\frac{18}{36} = 0.5 \\), which matches.\n\n4. For \\( k = 4 \\):\n\n- \\( t = 16 \\)\n\n- \\( r = \\frac{16 + 4}{2} = 10 \\)\n\n- \\( b = \\frac{16 - 4}{2} = 6 \\)\n\n- Total ways to pick 2 balls: \\( \\binom{16}{2} = 120 \\)\n\n- Ways to pick one red and one blue: \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\)\n\n- Probability: \\( \\frac{60}{120} = 0.5 \\), which matches.\n\nWe can see a pattern here. For each integer \\( k \\geq 2 \\), \\( t = k^2 \\), \\( r = \\frac{k^2 + k}{2} \\), and \\( b = \\frac{k^2 - k}{2} \\) gives us a valid solution where the probability of drawing one red and one blue ball is 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the possible total number of balls in the box are perfect squares greater than or equal to 4 (since \\( k \\geq 2 \\)).\n\nSo, possible values of \\( t \\) are 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and so on.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{t = k^2 \\text{ for some integer } k \\geq 2} \\]"
