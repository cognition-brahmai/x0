She and her navigator, Fred Noonan, were flying their Lockheed Model 10 Electra from New Guinea to Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean when they lost contact with authorities. Despite extensive search efforts, neither Earhart nor Noonan were ever found, and their fate remains a topic of speculation and debate to this day."
