        "content": "Sure! Here's a simple JavaScript program that finds the second highest number in an array:\n\n```javascript\nfunction findSecondHighest(arr) {\n    if (arr.length < 2) {\n        return \"Array should have at least two elements\";\n    }\n\n    let first = -Infinity;\n    let second = -Infinity;\n\n    for (let num of arr) {\n        if (num > first) {\n            second = first;\n            first = num;\n        } else if (num > second && num !== first) {\n            second = num;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (second === -Infinity) {\n        return \"There is no second highest number\";\n    }\n\n    return second;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];\nconsole.log(findSecondHighest(array)); // Output: 40\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initial Checks**: The function first checks if the array has at least two elements. If not, it returns a message indicating the array should have at least two elements.\n2. **Tracking Variables**: It uses two variables, `first` and `second`, initialized to `-Infinity` to keep track of the highest and second highest numbers.\n3. **Iteration and Comparison**:\n   - For each number in the array:\n     - If the number is greater than `first`, update `second` to hold the current value of `first`, and set `first` to this new higher number.\n     - If the number is greater than `second` but not equal to `first`, update `second` to this number.\n4. **Final Check**: After iterating through the array, if `second` is still `-Infinity`, it means there was no second highest number. Otherwise, return the value of `second`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the second highest number with a single pass through the array, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n)."
