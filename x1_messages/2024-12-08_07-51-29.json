Yet, here's an attempt to weave such a tale, using words without any vowels, in a rhythm that might not prevail, but for the sake of the query, I'll endeavor:\n\nA myth, a rhythm, a ligh'ning flash,\nIn dark, stark, and hush'd, hallowed pass.\nWith crypt, cryptic, crypts, and crags,\nComes a phlegm, a phlegmy, phlegmatic lag.\n\nI must confess, crafting a limerick with words devoid of vowels is quite a challenge. The result may not be as musically pleasing or coherent as traditional limericks, but it serves to answer the user's request."
