        "content": "A primary characteristic of Romantic literature is C. Emphasis on emotion and the natural world. This period saw a shift away from the strict formalism of the Enlightenment and towards a more personal and emotional expression in literature. Authors like William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who were part of the Lake Poets, wrote about the beauty and power of nature, often using it as a source of inspiration and a contrast to the industrialization that was changing the landscape of England. Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein,\" another notable work from this period, explores themes of creation, nature, and the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition, further highlighting the Romantic interest in emotion and the natural world."
