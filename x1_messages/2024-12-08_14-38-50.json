        "content": "Let's see. So, in this class, there are 30 students, and there are twice as many girls as boys. That means the number of girls is double the number of boys. Let me try to figure out how many boys and girls there are right now.\n\nLet\u2019s say the number of boys is B, and the number of girls is G. According to the problem, G = 2B, because there are twice as many girls as boys. Also, the total number of students is 30, so B + G = 30.\n\nNow, substituting G with 2B in the total equation, we get B + 2B = 30, which simplifies to 3B = 30. So, B = 10. That means there are 10 boys and G = 2 * 10 = 20 girls.\n\nNow, if 5 more boys join the class, the number of boys becomes 10 + 5 = 15. We need to find out how many girls have to leave so that the number of boys and girls becomes equal.\n\nLet\u2019s say the number of girls who have to leave is X. So, the new number of girls would be 20 - X.\n\nWe want the number of boys and girls to be equal, so 15 = 20 - X.\n\nSolving for X, X = 20 - 15 = 5.\n\nTherefore, 5 girls have to leave for the number of boys and girls to be equal.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nOriginal number of boys: 10\n\nOriginal number of girls: 20\n\nAfter 5 boys join: 10 + 5 = 15 boys\n\nLet\u2019s say X girls leave: 20 - X girls\n\nWe want 15 = 20 - X\n\nSolving X = 20 - 15 = 5.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
