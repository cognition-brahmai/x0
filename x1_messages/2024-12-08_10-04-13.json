Currently, there are 1,500 patients in the hospital, with 200 nurses working in various shifts. Research suggests that a 1:4 nurse-to-patient ratio results in better outcomes. Calculate how many additional nurses need to be hired to achieve this ratio, considering that each nurse works 40 hours per week and must have at least two days off per week. Describe your calculations step by step."

This information is important for scheduling but does not directly affect the calculation of the number of nurses needed to maintain the patient-to-nurse ratio. The ratio is based on the number of nurses available to care for patients at any given time, assuming proper scheduling to cover all shifts.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to ensure that the hospital can accommodate the additional nurses within their scheduling constraints. With each nurse working 40 hours per week and having two days off, the hospital needs to plan shifts accordingly to ensure continuous coverage.\n\nIn summary, to achieve a 1:4 nurse-to-patient ratio, the hospital should hire 175 additional nurses."
