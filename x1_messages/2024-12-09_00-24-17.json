So, for those first 5 days, the total pages read would be 20 pages/day times 5 days, which is 100 pages.\n\nThen, they increase their reading rate to 30 pages per day for the next 10 days. So, for those 10 days, it's 30 pages/day times 10 days, which equals 300 pages.\n\nNow, to find the total pages read over all 15 days, we just add the two amounts together: 100 pages plus 300 pages equals 400 pages.\n\nSo, the person will have read 400 pages in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
