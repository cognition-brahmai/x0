        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing different sports, and I need to figure out how many students play exactly two sports. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nSo, there are 30 students in total. Out of these, 18 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 22 play volleyball. That adds up to 18 + 20 + 22 = 60, which is more than the total number of students. That means a lot of students are playing more than one sport.\n\nNow, I know that 12 students play all three sports. That's a key piece of information. I need to find out how many students play exactly two sports, not all three.\n\nI think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the union of three sets is:\n\nn(A \u222a B \u222a C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 C) - n(B \u2229 C) + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nIn this case, A is soccer, B is basketball, and C is volleyball. We know that n(A \u222a B \u222a C) is 30, since there are 30 students in total. We also know n(A) = 18, n(B) = 20, n(C) = 22, and n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = 12.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n30 = 18 + 20 + 22 - n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 C) - n(B \u2229 C) + 12\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n30 = 60 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + 12\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the inclusion-exclusion formula. Actually, the correct formula is:\n\nn(A \u222a B \u222a C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 C) - n(B \u2229 C) + n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nSo, plugging in the known values:\n\n30 = 18 + 20 + 22 - n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 C) - n(B \u2229 C) + 12\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n30 = 60 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + 12\n\nWait, that's still not making sense. Let me calculate 18 + 20 + 22 + 12:\n\nThat's 18 + 20 = 38, plus 22 is 60, plus 12 is 72. But that can't be right because the total number of students is only 30.\n\nNo, I think I'm missing something here. The inclusion-exclusion formula is correct, but maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) as the number of students who play both soccer and basketball.\n\n- n(A \u2229 C) as the number who play both soccer and volleyball.\n\n- n(B \u2229 C) as the number who play both basketball and volleyball.\n\nAnd n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) is given as 12.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n30 = 18 + 20 + 22 - n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 C) - n(B \u2229 C) + 12\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n30 = 60 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + 12\n\nWait, 60 plus 12 is 72, so:\n\n30 = 72 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)]\n\nNow, solving for the sum of the pairwise intersections:\n\n[n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] = 72 - 30 = 42\n\nSo, n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C) = 42\n\nBut I need to find the number of students who play exactly two sports. Now, the intersections n(A \u2229 B), n(A \u2229 C), and n(B \u2229 C) include both the students who play exactly two sports and those who play all three sports.\n\nSo, to find the number of students who play exactly two sports, I need to subtract the number who play all three sports from each pairwise intersection and then sum those.\n\nIn other words, the number of students who play exactly two sports is:\n\n[n(A \u2229 B) - n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)] + [n(A \u2229 C) - n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)] + [n(B \u2229 C) - n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)]\n\nGiven that n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = 12, this becomes:\n\n[n(A \u2229 B) - 12] + [n(A \u2229 C) - 12] + [n(B \u2229 C) - 12]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] - 3 * 12\n\nWe already know that [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] = 42, so:\n\n42 - 36 = 6\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play exactly two sports is 6.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWe have:\n\nn(A \u222a B \u222a C) = 30\n\nn(A) = 18\n\nn(B) = 20\n\nn(C) = 22\n\nn(A \u2229 B \u2229 C) = 12\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\n30 = 18 + 20 + 22 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + 12\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 = 60 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] + 12\n\n30 = 72 - [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)]\n\nSo, [n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] = 72 - 30 = 42\n\nNow, the number of students who play exactly two sports is:\n\n[n(A \u2229 B) + n(A \u2229 C) + n(B \u2229 C)] - 3 * n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nWhich is 42 - 3 * 12 = 42 - 36 = 6\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of Venn diagrams. The total number of students playing at least one sport is 30. The sum of students playing each sport is 18 + 20 + 22 = 60, but this counts students playing two sports twice and those playing all three sports three times.\n\nTo correct for this, we subtract the number of students playing each pair of sports, which removes the triple-counted students twice (once in each pairwise intersection). Then, we add back the number of students playing all three sports to account for the fact that they were subtracted too many times.\n\nBut in this problem, we're asked specifically for the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\nSo, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can find the number of students playing exactly two sports by subtracting those who play all three sports from each pairwise intersection and then summing those up.\n\nYes, my earlier calculation seems solid. The answer should be 6 students play exactly two sports.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
