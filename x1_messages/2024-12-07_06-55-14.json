        "content": "Sure! Below is an example of a simple server application written in GoLang that listens for incoming connections and responds with the current date and time.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\nCreate a new file, for example, `main.go`, and add the following code:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Listen on all available network interfaces on port 8080\n\tlistener, err := net.Listen(\"tcp\", \":8080\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error listening:\", err.Error())\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tdefer listener.Close()\n\tfmt.Println(\"Server is listening on port 8080...\")\n\n\tfor {\n\t\t// Accept incoming connections\n\t\tconn, err := listener.Accept()\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error accepting connection:\", err.Error())\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Handle each connection in a new goroutine\n\t\tgo handleConnection(conn)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc handleConnection(conn net.Conn) {\n\tdefer conn.Close()\n\n\t// Get the current date and time\n\tcurrentTime := time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123)\n\n\t// Send the current date and time to the client\n\t_, err := conn.Write([]byte(currentTime + \"\\n\"))\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error sending data:\", err.Error())\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Println(\"Sent current date and time to\", conn.RemoteAddr())\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Listening for Connections:**\n   - The server listens on all available network interfaces on port 8080 using `net.Listen(\"tcp\", \":8080\")`.\n\n2. **Accepting Connections:**\n   - The server enters a loop where it accepts incoming connections with `listener.Accept()`.\n   - Each accepted connection is handled in a new goroutine using `go handleConnection(conn)` to handle multiple clients concurrently.\n\n3. **Handling Connections:**\n   - In the `handleConnection` function, the current date and time are retrieved using `time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123)`.\n   - The current date and time are sent back to the client using `conn.Write()`.\n\n4. **Closing Connections:**\n   - The connection is closed after sending the response using `conn.Close()`.\n\n### Running the Server:\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `main.go`.\n\n2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.go`.\n\n3. Run the server using the following command:\n\n   ```sh\n   go run main.go\n   ```\n\n4. The server will start listening on port 8080. You can test it by connecting to it using a tool like `telnet` or `nc` (netcat):\n\n   ```sh\n   telnet localhost 8080\n   ```\n\n   Or using `nc`:\n\n   ```sh\n   nc localhost 8080\n   ```\n\n   You should see the current date and time displayed.\n\nThis is a basic example to get you started. In a real-world scenario, you might want to handle more complex requests, implement error handling, and consider security measures."
