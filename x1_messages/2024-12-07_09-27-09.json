        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we know that the factory produces 200 widgets per hour. So, in an 8-hour workday, the total number of widgets produced would be:\n\n200 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 1600 widgets\n\nNow, out of these 1600 widgets, 5% fail the quality test and need to be discarded. So, we need to find out how many widgets that is:\n\n5% of 1600 = 0.05 \u00d7 1600 = 80 widgets\n\nTherefore, the number of widgets that pass the quality test and are successfully packaged is:\n\n1600 total widgets - 80 failed widgets = 1520 widgets\n\nSo, 1520 widgets are successfully packaged in an 8-hour workday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1520} \\]"
