        "content": "So the car travels 180 miles on 6 gallons of gas, and I need to find out its fuel efficiency in miles per gallon. Alright, fuel efficiency is usually measured as how many miles you can travel per gallon of gas. So, I think I need to divide the total miles by the gallons of gas used.\n\nLet me write that down: fuel efficiency = miles \u00f7 gallons.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: fuel efficiency = 180 miles \u00f7 6 gallons.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Let me do the division: 180 divided by 6 is 30.\n\nSo, the car's fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect fuel efficiency, like driving conditions or speed, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It just gives the total miles and gallons used.\n\nMaybe I should check my division to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 6 gallons times 30 miles per gallon does equal 180 miles, so that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. If 6 gallons allow for 180 miles, then 1 gallon would allow for x miles, where x is the fuel efficiency.\n\nSo, setting up the proportion: 6 gallons / 180 miles = 1 gallon / x miles.\n\nWait, actually, that would be 6 gallons / 180 miles = 1 gallon / x miles.\n\nCross-multiplying: 6 * x = 180 * 1, so 6x = 180, therefore x = 180 / 6 = 30 miles per gallon.\n\nAgain, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 30 miles per gallon is correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using unit conversions or something like that.\n\nLet's see, miles per gallon is already the unit I need, so I don't think I need to convert anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of rate. The car's fuel consumption rate is 6 gallons per 180 miles, but I need the inverse of that, which is miles per gallon.\n\nSo, rate = miles / gallons = 180 / 6 = 30 miles per gallon.\n\nHmm, same answer again.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The car's fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
