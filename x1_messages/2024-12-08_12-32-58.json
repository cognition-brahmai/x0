        "content": "To find the average speed of the train in kilometers per hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the average speed in miles per hour.**\n   The formula for average speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}}\n   \\]\n   Here, the total distance is 150 miles and the total time is 3 hours.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed in mph} = \\frac{150 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 50 \\text{ mph}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the speed from miles per hour to kilometers per hour.**\n   We know that 1 mile is approximately equal to 1.60934 kilometers. Therefore, to convert miles per hour to kilometers per hour, we multiply by this conversion factor.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed in km/h} = 50 \\text{ mph} \\times 1.60934 \\frac{\\text{km}}{\\text{mile}} = 80.467 \\text{ km/h}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Round the answer to a reasonable precision.**\n   Typically, for practical purposes, we can round the speed to two decimal places.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed in km/h} \\approx 80.47 \\text{ km/h}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the train is approximately 80.47 kilometers per hour."
