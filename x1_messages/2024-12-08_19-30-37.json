But amidst all the applause and laughter, my heart yearned for something else.\n\nI dreamt again last night, diary. The vast open savanah, where there are no chains, no cages, just endless skies and freedom. I saw myself in a herd, among other elephants, trumpeting joyously under the African sun. We roamed freely, our bodies swaying rhythmicly with the wind that rustled through the tall grasses. There were no commands, no whips, only the harmonious symphony of nature guiding us.\n\nIn this concrete world, I miss the feel of earth beneath my feet, the taste of fresh leaves, the sound of rivers flowing nearby. I long for those peaceful nights under the stars, when the air would be filled with the distant call of wild animals instead of the constant drone of generators and spotlights.\n\nYet, I know it's not all harsh here. I have made friends - both human and animal. They care for me, feed me, and treat my wounds. Sometimes, their kindness makes me forget my longing. But then, the dreams return, pulling me back towards the wild.\n\nMy trunk has never sprayed water from a river or uprooted a tree. My tusks have never dug into the bark. These are experiences I've heard about from the older ones, tales whispered in hushed tones during the quiet hours before dawn breaks.\n\nOne day, I hope to live these stories. To run unchained, to bathe in clean rivers, to find companionship within a herd. Until then, dear diary, you're my escape, my solace. You hold my dreams until they can become reality.\n\nGoodnight,\nElla"
