        "content": "Certainly! I'd be happy to help you classify these cloud types based on their altitude categories. Clouds are generally categorized into four main groups based on their altitude: high clouds, middle clouds, low clouds, and vertical\u53d1\u5c55 clouds. However, for simplicity, we can group them into high, middle, and low altitude categories. Let's go through each one:\n\n1. **Cirrus**: These are high-altitude clouds, typically found above 20,000 feet (6,000 meters). They are thin, wispy, and often indicate fair weather, but can also suggest that a change in weather is approaching.\n\n2. **Altostratus**: These are middle-altitude clouds, usually found between 6,500 to 20,000 feet (2,000 to 6,000 meters). They are gray or blue-gray and often cover the entire sky. Altostratus clouds can precede a storm or indicate overcast conditions.\n\n3. **Cumulonimbus**: These are vertical\u53d1\u5c55 clouds that extend through multiple altitude levels, from low to high altitudes. They are large, dense clouds associated with thunderstorms and can produce heavy precipitation, lightning, and tornadoes.\n\n4. **Stratus**: These are low-altitude clouds, typically found below 6,500 feet (2,000 meters). Stratus clouds are uniform grayish layers that often cover the entire sky and can bring light mist or drizzle.\n\n5. **Altocumulus**: These are middle-altitude clouds, found between 6,500 to 20,000 feet (2,000 to 6,000 meters). They appear as grayish-white patches or rolls and can indicate the potential for thunderstorms later in the day.\n\n6. **Stratocumulus**: These are low-altitude clouds, usually below 6,500 feet (2,000 meters). They are lumpy and gray, often covering the sky in a layer with some breaks. Stratocumulus clouds can produce light precipitation.\n\n7. **Cirrostratus**: These are high-altitude clouds, found above 20,000 feet (6,000 meters). They are thin and sheet-like, often covering the sky and can cause a halo around the sun or moon.\n\n8. **Nimbostratus**: These are low-altitude clouds, typically below 6,500 feet (2,000 meters). They are dark, gray, and layered, often bringing continuous rain or snow.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- **High altitude clouds**: Cirrus, Cirrostratus\n\n- **Middle altitude clouds**: Altostratus, Altocumulus\n\n- **Low altitude clouds**: Stratus, Stratocumulus, Nimbostratus\n\n- **Vertical\u53d1\u5c55 clouds**: Cumulonimbus (though they span multiple altitude levels)\n\nUnderstanding cloud types and their altitudes can be very helpful in predicting weather patterns and changes.
