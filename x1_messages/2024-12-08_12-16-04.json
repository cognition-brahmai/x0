She was born in Warsaw, Poland, and is indeed renowned for being the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different fields of science. She received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. Then, in 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. Her pioneering work in the field of radioactivity has had a profound impact on science and medicine."
