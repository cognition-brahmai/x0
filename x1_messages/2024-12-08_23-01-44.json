        "content": "So the factory makes 10,000 widgets every day and has a 2% defect rate. It works for 300 days a year. We need to find out how many non-defective widgets are produced in a year.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many widgets are produced in a year. Since the factory makes 10,000 widgets per day and operates for 300 days, we can multiply these two numbers to get the annual production.\n\nAnnual production = 10,000 widgets/day * 300 days/year\n\nAnnual production = 3,000,000 widgets/year\n\nNow, out of these 3,000,000 widgets, 2% are defective. So, to find the number of defective widgets, we can calculate 2% of 3,000,000.\n\nDefective widgets = 2% of 3,000,000\n\nDefective widgets = 0.02 * 3,000,000\n\nDefective widgets = 60,000\n\nNow, to find the number of non-defective widgets, we subtract the defective ones from the total annual production.\n\nNon-defective widgets = Annual production - Defective widgets\n\nNon-defective widgets = 3,000,000 - 60,000\n\nNon-defective widgets = 2,940,000\n\nSo, the factory produces 2,940,000 non-defective widgets annually.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2940000} \\]"
