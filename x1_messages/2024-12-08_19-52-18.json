        "content": "Let's see. If a factory produces 500 units per day and operates every day for a year, which is 365 days, then to find the total annual production, I just need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a year.\n\nSo, that would be 500 units/day \u00d7 365 days.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\nFirst, 500 \u00d7 300 = 150,000.\n\nThen, 500 \u00d7 65 = 32,500.\n\nAdding those together: 150,000 + 32,500 = 182,500.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 182,500 units in a year.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's another way to look at this to confirm. Maybe using the concept of annual production rates or considering any possible variations, but the question seems straightforward.\n\nIt assumes constant production with no downtime except for the specified operational days.\n\nSo, yes, 500 units per day for 365 days equals 182,500 units per year.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{182500} \\]"
