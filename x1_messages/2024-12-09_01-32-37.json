        "content": "So the zoo is planning to build a new home for its giraffes, right? They've got 10 adult giraffes, and each one needs at least 1,000 square feet of space. That seems like a lot, but I guess giraffes need plenty of room to stretch their necks and walk around.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total area required for all 10 giraffes. If each giraffe needs 1,000 square feet, then for 10 giraffes, it would be 10 times 1,000, which is 10,000 square feet. That sounds like a big area, but I think it's necessary for the giraffes' well-being.\n\nNow, the next part is estimating the cost to construct this habitat. The problem says it costs $50 per square foot to build it. So, to find the total cost, I should multiply the total area by the cost per square foot.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal area = 10 giraffes \u00d7 1,000 square feet/giraffe = 10,000 square feet\n\nCost per square foot = $50\n\nTotal cost = total area \u00d7 cost per square foot = 10,000 square feet \u00d7 $50/square foot\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other cost involved, like fencing, lighting, or special features for giraffes? The problem doesn't mention anything else, so maybe we're just supposed to consider the cost per square foot for the enclosure itself.\n\nAlright, so proceeding with the calculation:\n\nTotal cost = 10,000 square feet \u00d7 $50/square foot = $500,000\n\nHmm, $500,000 seems like a lot of money for the habitat. But considering that giraffes are large animals and need a lot of space, I suppose it's reasonable.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the area:\n\n10 giraffes \u00d7 1,000 square feet each = 10,000 square feet. That seems correct.\n\nThen, cost per square foot is $50.\n\nSo, 10,000 square feet \u00d7 $50/square foot = $500,000.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any discounts or additional costs that might affect the total. For example, maybe there are economies of scale in construction, where building a larger area could reduce the cost per square foot. Or perhaps there are permits or landscaping costs that need to be factored in.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, it seems that the cost is straightforward at $50 per square foot, and we're only supposed to calculate the cost of the enclosure itself.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the total area needed for the enclosure is 10,000 square feet, and the estimated cost to construct it is $500,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500000} \\]"
