It was forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor during the Second Age. The One Ring has the power to control the other Rings of Power and to render its bearer invisible, though this comes with a heavy price, as it also corrupts the user over time. The main plot of \"The Lord of the Rings\" revolves around the quest to destroy the One Ring and thus deprive Sauron of his power."
