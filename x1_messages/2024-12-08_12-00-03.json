        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden with an area of 200 square meters, and it's given that the length is twice its width. We need to find the dimensions, which means finding both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the area of a rectangle. The area (A) is equal to the length (L) multiplied by the width (W). So, A = L * W.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the area is 200 square meters. So, we can write:\n\nL * W = 200\n\nAlso, it's given that the length is twice the width. That means L = 2W.\n\nOkay, so now we can substitute the expression for L from the second equation into the first equation.\n\nSo, (2W) * W = 200\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n2W\u00b2 = 200\n\nNow, to find W, we can divide both sides by 2:\n\nW\u00b2 = 100\n\nThen, taking the square root of both sides:\n\nW = \u221a100\n\nW = 10 meters\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length using L = 2W:\n\nL = 2 * 10 = 20 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 20 meters in length and 10 meters in width.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure everything adds up. If L = 20 meters and W = 10 meters, then the area should be 20 * 10 = 200 square meters, which matches the given area. Also, the length is indeed twice the width, since 20 is twice 10. So, everything seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the garden are \\boxed{20 \\text{ meters by } 10 \\text{ meters}}."
