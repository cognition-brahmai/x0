        "content": "So I have this problem here. There are 30 students in a class. Out of these, 18 play basketball, 15 play soccer, and 5 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport. Hmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Imagine two circles overlapping each other. One circle represents students who play basketball, and the other represents students who play soccer. The overlapping part is for students who play both sports.\n\nSo, the basketball circle has 18 students, the soccer circle has 15, and the overlap has 5 students who play both.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many students play at least one of the sports. To do this, I can add the number of basketball players and soccer players and then subtract the number of students who play both, because they were counted twice otherwise.\n\nSo, the total number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\n18 (basketball) + 15 (soccer) - 5 (both) = 28 students.\n\nNow, since there are 30 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport would be:\n\n30 (total students) - 28 (play at least one sport) = 2 students.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |A| is the number of elements in set A (basketball players),\n\n- |B| is the number of elements in set B (soccer players),\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of elements in both sets (students who play both sports),\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the number of elements in either set A or set B.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n|A \u222a B| = 18 + 15 - 5 = 28 students.\n\nAgain, subtracting this from the total number of students:\n\n30 - 28 = 2 students who don't play either sport.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Total students = 30\n\n- Students who play basketball = 18\n\n- Students who play soccer = 15\n\n- Students who play both = 5\n\nI can find the number of students who play only basketball by subtracting those who play both from the total basketball players: 18 - 5 = 13 students play only basketball.\n\nSimilarly, the number of students who play only soccer is: 15 - 5 = 10 students.\n\nNow, the total number of students who play at least one sport is the sum of those who play only basketball, only soccer, and both:\n\n13 (only basketball) + 10 (only soccer) + 5 (both) = 28 students.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total:\n\n30 - 28 = 2 students who don't play either sport.\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so my answer should be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nSuppose I were to use probabilities or something, but that might be overcomplicating it for this scenario. Since it's a straightforward sets problem, the inclusion-exclusion principle seems perfectly suitable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider making a table to represent the students:\n\n|                 | Plays Soccer | Does not play Soccer | Total |\n\n|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|-------|\n\n| Plays Basketball| 5            |                       | 18    |\n\n| Does not play Basketball |        |                       |       |\n\n| Total           | 15           |                       | 30    |\n\nFirst, fill in the known values:\n\n- Students who play both basketball and soccer: 5\n\n- Total basketball players: 18\n\n- Total soccer players: 15\n\n- Total students: 30\n\nNow, fill in the missing values.\n\nStudents who play only basketball: 18 (total basketball) - 5 (both) = 13\n\nStudents who play only soccer: 15 (total soccer) - 5 (both) = 10\n\nNow, the total number of students who play at least one sport is 13 (only basketball) + 10 (only soccer) + 5 (both) = 28\n\nTherefore, students who don't play either sport: 30 - 28 = 2\n\nThis matches my previous calculations.\n\nI think it's clear now that the answer is 2 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
