        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we've got a village with 10 houses. Each house has 4 doors, and each door has 3 locks. Also, each key can only open one lock. We need to find out how many keys are needed to open all the locks in the village.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of locks in the village. To do that, I can start by finding out how many locks are on each house.\n\nSince each house has 4 doors, and each door has 3 locks, the number of locks per house is:\n\n4 doors/house * 3 locks/door = 12 locks/house\n\nNow, there are 10 houses in the village, so the total number of locks in the village would be:\n\n10 houses * 12 locks/house = 120 locks\n\nNow, since each key can only open one lock, that means we need a separate key for each lock. Therefore, the number of keys needed should be equal to the total number of locks.\n\nSo, the total number of keys needed is 120.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to interpret this? Maybe some locks could be opened by the same key, but the problem says that one key can open only one lock. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nStarting with the number of houses: 10.\n\nNumber of doors per house: 4.\n\nNumber of locks per door: 3.\n\nSo, locks per house: 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nTotal locks in the village: 10 * 12 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each house having 4 doors with 3 locks each, so total locks per house is 12, and with 10 houses, it's 120 locks.\n\nTherefore, 120 keys are needed.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor to consider here. The answer should be 120 keys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
