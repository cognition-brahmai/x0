It was crafted by the legendary sorceress Azura, who harnessed the raw energies of the cosmos to imbue the orb with otherworldly power.\n\nPower:  The orb possesses the ability to manipulate light and darkness, granting its wielder control over illusions, invisibility, and even the manipulation of shadows. It is said that Azura used the orb to create passages between dimensions, allowing her to traverse the multiverse at will.\n\nCurrent Location:  The Orb of Azura is currently housed within the deepest chamber of the Luminari Temple, a sacred site hidden high in the mountains of the Enchanted Peaks. The temple is shrouded in eternal mist, making it nearly impossible to locate without the guidance of the temple's priests.\n\nGuardian:  The orb is guarded by the Shadow Warden, a being of living darkness created by Azura herself to protect her most precious creation. The Shadow Warden is an elusive and formidable guardian, capable of blending into the shadows and striking without warning. It is said that only those pure of heart and worthy of the orb's power can pass the Warden's trials."
