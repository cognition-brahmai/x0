        "content": "Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, is credited with signing the Emancipation Proclamation. This historic document, issued on January 1, 1863, declared that all individuals who were held as slaves in Confederate states in rebellion against the U.S. \"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\" It was a significant step toward the abolition of slavery in the United States, although it did not immediately free all slaves, as it only applied to areas not under Union control. The proclamation also allowed for the enrollment of former slaves into the Union Army, providing additional manpower for the war effort. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1865, ultimately abolished slavery throughout the entire United States."
