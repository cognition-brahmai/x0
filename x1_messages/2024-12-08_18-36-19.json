        "content": "Let's see. There are 3 employees, and they earn different amounts per hour: $15, $20, and $25 respectively. Each of them works 6 hours a day. I need to find out the total daily wage cost for the company.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much each employee earns in a day and then add those amounts together.\n\nSo, for the first employee who earns $15 per hour, working 6 hours a day would be:\n\n15 * 6 = 90 dollars per day.\n\nNext, the second employee earns $20 per hour, so:\n\n20 * 6 = 120 dollars per day.\n\nAnd the third employee earns $25 per hour, so:\n\n25 * 6 = 150 dollars per day.\n\nNow, I need to add up these daily wages to get the total cost for the company:\n\n90 + 120 + 150.\n\nLet's add 90 and 120 first:\n\n90 + 120 = 210.\n\nThen add 150 to that:\n\n210 + 150 = 360.\n\nSo, the total daily wage cost for the company is $360.\n\nWait a minute, is there a faster way to calculate this? Maybe by adding the hourly rates first and then multiplying by the number of hours worked.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe hourly rates are $15, $20, and $25. Adding them up:\n\n15 + 20 = 35.\n\n35 + 25 = 60.\n\nSo, combined, their hourly rates total $60 per hour.\n\nNow, since each works 6 hours a day, the total daily wage cost would be:\n\n60 * 6 = 360 dollars.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, either way works, but this might be a bit faster.\n\nI think the answer is $360.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
