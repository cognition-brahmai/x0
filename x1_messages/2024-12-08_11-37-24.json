        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets at a rate of 10 per hour, and it operates for 8 hours a day. So, first, I need to find out how many widgets are produced in a day.\n\nProduced per hour: 10 widgets\n\nOperating hours per day: 8 hours\n\nSo, total widgets produced in a day would be:\n\n10 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 80 widgets\n\nNow, each widget takes 30 minutes to be inspected and packaged. I need to find out how many widgets can be inspected and packaged in the same 8-hour day.\n\nFirst, convert 8 hours to minutes:\n\n8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes\n\nEach widget takes 30 minutes to inspect and package, so the number of widgets that can be inspected and packaged in a day is:\n\n480 minutes / 30 minutes/widget = 16 widgets\n\nSo, even though 80 widgets are produced in a day, only 16 can be inspected and packaged in that same day.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't make sense. If the factory is producing 10 widgets per hour and each takes 30 minutes to inspect and package, I need to think about the process flow.\n\nMaybe I should consider that while new widgets are being produced, the already produced ones are being inspected and packaged.\n\nLet me think in terms of time.\n\nIn one hour:\n\n- Production: 10 widgets\n\n- Inspection and packaging: Since each widget takes 30 minutes, in one hour, 2 widgets can be inspected and packaged (60 minutes / 30 minutes per widget = 2 widgets).\n\nSo, every hour, 10 widgets are added to the production line, and 2 widgets are completed in inspection and packaging.\n\nBut, there's a time lag here. The widgets need to be inspected and packaged after they are produced.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the entire 8-hour shift.\n\nTotal production in 8 hours: 80 widgets\n\nTotal inspection and packaging capacity in 8 hours: 16 widgets\n\nSo, in one day, only 16 widgets can be fully produced, inspected, and packaged, because inspection and packaging are the bottleneck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inspection and packaging process happens after production, so the 80 widgets produced in a day need to be inspected and packaged the next day.\n\nBut the question asks for how many widgets can be produced, inspected, and packaged in one day.\n\nGiven that inspection and packaging take 30 minutes per widget, and there are 480 minutes in an 8-hour day, only 16 widgets can be inspected and packaged in a day.\n\nTherefore, even though 80 widgets are produced, only 16 can be inspected and packaged in the same day.\n\nSo, the factory can produce, inspect, and package 16 widgets in one day.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Maybe I need to consider that the inspection and packaging process can happen simultaneously with production.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose the factory starts production at the beginning of the day.\n\nIn the first hour:\n\n- Produces 10 widgets\n\n- Starts inspecting and packaging the widgets produced in the previous hour (but since it's the first hour, there are none from the previous hour)\n\nSo, in the first hour, only production happens.\n\nIn the second hour:\n\n- Produces another 10 widgets\n\n- Starts inspecting and packaging the 10 widgets produced in the first hour\n\nBut inspection and packaging take 30 minutes per widget, so in one hour, only 2 widgets can be inspected and packaged.\n\nSimilarly, in the third hour:\n\n- Produces another 10 widgets\n\n- Starts inspecting and packaging the 10 widgets produced in the second hour\n\nAgain, only 2 can be completed in an hour.\n\nThis seems inefficient. Maybe I need to think about a continuous flow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a separate inspection and packaging line that operates concurrently with the production line.\n\nIf that's the case, and the inspection and packaging line operates for the entire 8 hours, it can handle 16 widgets in a day.\n\nTherefore, regardless of how many widgets are produced, only 16 can be inspected and packaged in a day.\n\nHence, the factory can produce, inspect, and package 16 widgets in one day.\n\nBut I feel like there might be a better way to maximize throughput.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inspection and packaging process can overlap.\n\nFor example, once a widget is produced, it immediately moves to inspection and packaging, and the worker inspects and packages it in 30 minutes.\n\nIf there are enough workers or stations for inspection and packaging, perhaps multiple widgets can be in inspection and packaging at the same time.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the number of inspection and packaging stations or workers.\n\nAssuming there is only one inspection and packaging station, then only one widget can be inspected and packaged at a time, taking 30 minutes each, so 16 widgets per day.\n\nIf there are multiple stations, say n stations, then n widgets can be inspected and packaged simultaneously, each taking 30 minutes.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of widgets that can be inspected and packaged in a day would be:\n\n(n stations) * (number of 30-minute intervals in an 8-hour day)\n\nNumber of 30-minute intervals in 8 hours: 16 intervals\n\nSo, with n stations, the factory can inspect and package n * 16 widgets per day.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the number of stations, I'll assume there's only one station, hence only 16 widgets can be inspected and packaged in a day.\n\nTherefore, the factory can produce, inspect, and package 16 widgets in one day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the production rate and the inspection packaging rate and find the bottleneck.\n\nProduction rate: 10 widgets per hour\n\nInspection and packaging rate: 2 widgets per hour (since 30 minutes per widget)\n\nSo, the inspection and packaging rate is the bottleneck.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of widgets that can be produced, inspected, and packaged in a day is limited by the inspection and packaging rate.\n\nInspection and packaging rate: 2 widgets per hour\n\nOperating hours: 8 hours\n\nSo, 2 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 16 widgets per day\n\nHence, the factory can produce, inspect, and package 16 widgets in one day.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
