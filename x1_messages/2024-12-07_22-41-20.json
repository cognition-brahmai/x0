This is a common myth, but research has shown that dairy products do not cause the body to produce more mucus.\n\nIn fact, dairy products can be a good source of nutrients and may help soothe a sore throat or provide comfort during illness. It's important to continue eating a balanced diet, including dairy if tolerated, to support overall health and immune function.\n\nIf you experience discomfort or feel that dairy worsens your symptoms, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice."
