        "content": "Asymmetric cryptography primarily relies on public and private key pairs. So, the correct answer is D. Public and private key pairs.\n\nTo elaborate, asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys, which may be disseminated widely, and private keys, which are known only to the owner. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption. This allows for secure communication where the parties do not have to share a secret key in advance.\n\nOption A, shared secret keys, is actually a characteristic of symmetric cryptography, not asymmetric cryptography. In symmetric cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, and this key must be shared secretly between the communicating parties.\n\nOption B, symmetric algorithms, refers to encryption methods that use the same key for both encryption and decryption, which again is different from asymmetric cryptography.\n\nOption C, hash functions, are used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, typically for data integrity checks and not for encryption or decryption processes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Public and private key pairs."
