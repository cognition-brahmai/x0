        "content": "So Alice can paint a room in 5 hours, and Bob can do it in 7 hours. If they both start painting at the same time, how long will it take them to finish together? Hmm, this seems like a problem about combined work rates.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much of the room each person can paint per hour. That's their painting rate, right? So, Alice's rate is 1 room per 5 hours, which is 1/5 of the room per hour. Similarly, Bob's rate is 1 room per 7 hours, or 1/7 of the room per hour.\n\nIf they work together, their painting rates should add up. So, the total rate would be 1/5 plus 1/7 of the room per hour. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 7 is 35, I think.\n\nSo, 1/5 is equal to 7/35, and 1/7 is equal to 5/35. Adding them up gives 7/35 + 5/35 = 12/35 of the room per hour.\n\nNow, if they can paint 12/35 of the room in one hour, how long will it take them to paint the whole room? I think I need to find the time t such that (12/35) * t = 1 room.\n\nSo, t = 1 / (12/35) = 35/12 hours. Let me calculate that: 35 divided by 12 is 2.9167 hours, which is 2 hours and about 55 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that calculation. 35 divided by 12 is indeed 2.9167 hours. To convert the decimal part to minutes, 0.9167 times 60 minutes is approximately 55 minutes.\n\nSo, together, Alice and Bob can paint the room in approximately 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer? Maybe using the formula for combined work rates.\n\nI recall a formula for two people working together: time = (individual times)/(sum of individual rates). Wait, that doesn't sound right.\n\nActually, the formula is usually expressed as 1/(1/a + 1/b), where a and b are the individual times. But that's essentially what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the total work done as the sum of the work done by Alice and Bob. So, if they work for t hours, Alice paints (1/5)t of the room, and Bob paints (1/7)t of the room. Together, they paint (1/5)t + (1/7)t = 1 room.\n\nSo, (1/5 + 1/7)t = 1.\n\nWe already know that 1/5 + 1/7 = 12/35, so (12/35)t = 1, hence t = 35/12 hours.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I can also think about it in terms of their rates per hour and see if that makes sense.\n\nAlice paints 1/5 per hour, Bob paints 1/7 per hour. Together, 1/5 + 1/7 = 12/35 per hour.\n\nSo, to paint one room, time = 1 / (12/35) = 35/12 hours.\n\nI think that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of using the concept of \"work done\" per hour. If Alice can finish in 5 hours, her work rate is 1/5 per hour. Similarly, Bob's is 1/7 per hour.\n\nCombined, their work rate is 1/5 + 1/7 = 12/35 per hour.\n\nSo, the time to complete one room is 35/12 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the harmonic mean of their times, but I think that's more applicable when speeds are involved, not sure.\n\nWait, no, the formula for combined work rates is actually the harmonic mean, but I might be confusing it.\n\nAnyway, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to verify this.\n\nSuppose Alice and Bob work together for t hours. Alice paints (1/5)t of the room, Bob paints (1/7)t of the room. The sum should be 1 room:\n\n(1/5)t + (1/7)t = 1\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt*(1/5 + 1/7) = 1\n\nt*(12/35) = 1\n\nt = 35/12 hours\n\nYes, consistent again.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider their rates in terms of rooms per hour, Alice is 1/5, Bob is 1/7, together 12/35 rooms per hour.\n\nTime = total work / rate = 1 / (12/35) = 35/12 hours.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the answer should be 35/12 hours, which is approximately 2.9167 hours, or 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it in fractions for precision.\n\nTherefore, it will take them 35/12 hours to paint the room together.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{35}{12} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
