        "content": "So there's a class of 40 students, and 70% of them passed the exam. I need to find out how many students failed the exam. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many students passed the exam. Since 70% passed, I can calculate that by taking 70% of 40. To find a percentage of a number, I multiply the percentage by the number and then divide by 100. So, it's (70/100) * 40.\n\nLet me do the math: 70 divided by 100 is 0.7, and 0.7 multiplied by 40 is 28. So, 28 students passed the exam.\n\nNow, to find out how many failed, I can subtract the number of students who passed from the total number of students. That is, 40 minus 28.\n\n40 minus 28 equals 12.\n\nSo, 12 students failed the exam.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of students who failed and then find that number.\n\nIf 70% passed, then the remaining percentage must have failed. Since the total is 100%, the failure percentage is 100% minus 70%, which is 30%.\n\nSo, 30% of the students failed. Now, to find 30% of 40, it's (30/100) * 40.\n\n30 divided by 100 is 0.3, and 0.3 multiplied by 40 is 12.\n\nAgain, I get 12 students failed the exam.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like 12 students failed the exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
