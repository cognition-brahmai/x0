        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, and I need to find the probability of drawing 3 red balls in a row without replacing them. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of balls in the bag. There are 5 red and 7 blue, so that's a total of 12 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing the first red ball. Since there are 5 red balls out of 12 total, the probability is 5/12.\n\nNext, without replacing the first red ball, I need to draw a second red ball. Now, there are only 4 red balls left and the total number of balls is now 11, since I didn't replace the first one. So, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 4/11.\n\nThen, I need to draw a third red ball without replacing the first two. Now, there are 3 red balls left and the total number of balls is 10. So, the probability of drawing a third red ball is 3/10.\n\nSince these are sequential events without replacement, I need to multiply these probabilities together to get the overall probability of drawing 3 red balls in a row.\n\nSo, the calculation should be:\n\n(5/12) * (4/11) * (3/10)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 5 times 4 is 20, and 12 times 11 is 132, so (5/12) * (4/11) = 20/132, which simplifies to 5/33.\n\nThen, multiply that by 3/10:\n\n(5/33) * (3/10) = (5*3)/(33*10) = 15/330\n\nSimplify 15/330 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n15 \u00f7 15 = 1\n\n330 \u00f7 15 = 22\n\nSo, the probability is 1/22.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose 3 red balls out of 5 is C(5,3), and the total number of ways to choose any 3 balls out of 12 is C(12,3). So, the probability should be C(5,3)/C(12,3).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3!) / (3!*2!) = (5*4) / 2 = 10\n\nC(12,3) = 12! / (3!(12-3)!) = (12*11*10*9!) / (3!*9!) = (12*11*10) / (6) = 1320 / 6 = 220\n\nSo, C(5,3)/C(12,3) = 10/220 = 1/22\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing 3 red balls in a row without replacement is 1/22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{22}} \\]"
