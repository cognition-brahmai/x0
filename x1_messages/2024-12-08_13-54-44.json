        "content": "So the item is originally priced at $120, and there's a 20% discount being offered. I need to find out what the final price will be after applying the discount.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much the discount amounts to in dollars. Since it's 20% off, I need to calculate 20% of $120.\n\nI remember that to find a percentage of a number, I can multiply the percentage by the number and then divide by 100. So, 20% of $120 would be (20/100) * 120.\n\nLet me do the math: 20 divided by 100 is 0.2, and then 0.2 multiplied by 120 is 24. So, the discount is $24.\n\nNow, to find the final price, I need to subtract the discount from the original price. That means $120 minus $24.\n\n120 minus 24 is 96. So, the final price should be $96.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. I've heard that sometimes you can calculate the final price directly by multiplying the original price by (100% - discount percentage).\n\nSo, in this case, it would be 100% - 20% = 80%. Then, 80% of $120 should give me the final price.\n\nLet me calculate that: 80% of 120 is (80/100) * 120. 80 divided by 100 is 0.8, and 0.8 times 120 is 96. So, again, $96.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the final price after a 20% discount on a $120 item is $96.\n\nI think that makes sense. I've shopped around and often see discounts applied this way. It's good to know that I can use either method to calculate the final price, and both lead to the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try another example to see if this method works consistently.\n\nSuppose an item costs $100 and there's a 10% discount. Using the first method:\n\n10% of $100 is (10/100)*100 = 10, so the discount is $10.\n\nSubtracting that from the original price: $100 - $10 = $90.\n\nUsing the second method:\n\n100% - 10% = 90%, then 90% of $100 is (90/100)*100 = 90.\n\nAgain, $90.\n\nSeems consistent. So, for the original problem, the final price after a 20% discount on $120 is indeed $96.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
