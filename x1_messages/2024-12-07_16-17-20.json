        "content": "So, the store sells a pack of 5 pens for $3, and I need to find out how much it would cost to buy 25 pens. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many packs of 5 pens are there in 25 pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, I can divide 25 by 5 to find the number of packs. So, 25 divided by 5 is 5. That means I need 5 packs to get 25 pens.\n\nNow, each pack costs $3, and I need 5 packs. So, to find the total cost, I should multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack. That is, 5 packs times $3 per pack.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 5 times 3 is 15. So, it should cost $15 to buy 25 pens.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by finding the cost per pen and then multiplying by 25.\n\nOkay, if a pack of 5 pens costs $3, then the cost per pen would be $3 divided by 5 pens. So, 3 divided by 5 is $0.60 per pen.\n\nNow, if each pen costs $0.60, then for 25 pens, I would multiply 25 by $0.60.\n\nLet's do that: 25 times 0.60. Well, 25 times 0.60 is the same as 25 times 60 cents, which is 1500 cents. And since 100 cents make a dollar, 1500 cents is $15.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: $15.\n\nJust to be sure, maybe I can check with another method. Let's see, perhaps using proportions.\n\nIf 5 pens cost $3, then 25 pens would cost x dollars. So, I can set up a proportion: 5 pens / $3 = 25 pens / x dollars.\n\nWait, actually, that would be pens over dollars, so to solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 5 pens times x dollars equals 25 pens times $3.\n\nSo, 5x = 75.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 5: x = 15.\n\nAgain, the same answer, $15.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough. The cost to buy 25 pens is $15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
