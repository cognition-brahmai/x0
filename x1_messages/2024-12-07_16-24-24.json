        "content": "The American artist behind the iconic pop art piece \"Campbell's Soup Cans\" is Andy Warhol. This work, created in 1962, consists of 32 canvases, each depicting a different flavor of Campbell's Soup in its signature can. It is considered one of the most famous examples of pop art, a movement that celebrated everyday consumer culture and mass media imagery. Warhol's use of repetitive images and bright colors challenged traditional notions of art and helped to redefine the art world in the 20th century."
