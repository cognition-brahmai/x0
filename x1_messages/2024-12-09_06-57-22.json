The resort will have 300 rooms, with an average nightly rate of $250. Calculate the potential annual revenue for the resort, assuming an average occupancy rate of 75% throughout the year. Also, estimate the break-even point for the resort's construction cost of $50 million. Provide step-by-step reasoning."

Let's break it down.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the potential annual revenue**\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much revenue the resort can generate in a year based on the given parameters.\n\n- Number of rooms: 300\n- Average nightly rate: $250\n- Average occupancy rate: 75%\n- Number of days in a year: 365\n\nThe formula for annual revenue is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Revenue} = \\text{Number of Rooms} \\times \\text{Average Nightly Rate} \\times \\text{Occupancy Rate} \\times \\text{Number of Days in a Year} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Revenue} = 300 \\times 250 \\times 0.75 \\times 365 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the daily revenue:\n\n\\[ \\text{Daily Revenue} = \\text{Number of Rooms} \\times \\text{Average Nightly Rate} \\times \\text{Occupancy Rate} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Daily Revenue} = 300 \\times 250 \\times 0.75 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Daily Revenue} = 300 \\times 187.5 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Daily Revenue} = 56,250 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the annual revenue:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Revenue} = \\text{Daily Revenue} \\times \\text{Number of Days in a Year} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Revenue} = 56,250 \\times 365 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Revenue} = 20,506,250 \\]\n\nSo, the potential annual revenue for the resort is $20,506,250.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate the break-even point**\n\nThe break-even point is the amount of time it takes for the resort to generate enough revenue to cover its construction costs. In this case, the construction cost is $50 million.\n\nTo find the break-even point in years, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-Even Point (Years)} = \\frac{\\text{Construction Cost}}{\\text{Annual Revenue}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-Even Point (Years)} = \\frac{50,000,000}{20,506,250} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-Even Point (Years)} \\approx 2.438 \\]\n\nSo, it would take approximately 2.438 years to break even.\n\nIf we want to express this in years and months, 0.438 years is roughly 5.26 months.\n\nTherefore, the break-even point is approximately 2 years and 5 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe potential annual revenue for the resort is \\boxed{20506250} dollars, and the break-even point for the resort's construction cost of $50 million is approximately \\boxed{2.44} years."
