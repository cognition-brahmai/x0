Below is a step-by-step guide to creating such a server.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Server\n\nFirst, you need to set up the server that will listen for incoming connections from clients.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nclass ChatServer:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.clients = []\n\n    async def handle_client(self, reader, writer):\n        # Add the new client to the list\n        self.clients.append(writer)\n        try:\n            while True:\n                data = await reader.read(100)\n                if not data:\n                    break\n                message = data.decode()\n                print(f\"Received: {message}\")\n                # Broadcast the message to all clients\n                for client in self.clients:\n                    if client != writer:\n                        client.write(data)\n                        await client.drain()\n        finally:\n            # Remove the client when connection is lost\n            self.clients.remove(writer)\n            writer.close()\n\n    async def start_server(self):\n        server = await asyncio.start_server(\n            self.handle_client, '127.0.0.1', 8888)\n        async with server:\n            await server.serve_forever()\n\n# Run the server\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    chat_server = ChatServer()\n    asyncio.run(chat_server.start_server())\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Class Definition**: We define a `ChatServer` class to handle the server logic.\n2. **Client Handling**: The `handle_client` method manages individual client connections. It adds new clients to a list and removes them when they disconnect.\n3. **Message Broadcasting**: When a message is received from a client, it is broadcasted to all other connected clients.\n4. **Server Startup**: The `start_server` method sets up the server to listen on localhost at port 8888.\n\n### Step 2: Create a Simple Chat Client\n\nTo test the server, you can create a simple chat client that connects to the server and allows users to send and receive messages.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nclass ChatClient:\n    def __init__(self, host, port):\n        self.host = host\n        self.port = port\n\n    async def start_client(self):\n        reader, writer = await asyncio.open_connection(self.host, self.port)\n        asyncio.create_task(self.send_messages(writer))\n        await self.receive_messages(reader)\n\n    async def send_messages(self, writer):\n        while True:\n            message = input(\"You: \")\n            writer.write(message.encode())\n            await writer.drain()\n\n    async def receive_messages(self, reader):\n        while True:\n            data = await reader.read(100)\n            if not data:\n                break\n            message = data.decode()\n            print(f\"Other: {message}\")\n\n# Run the client\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    chat_client = ChatClient('127.0.0.1', 8888)\n    asyncio.run(chat_client.start_client())\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Class Definition**: The `ChatClient` class handles the client logic.\n2. **Client Startup**: The `start_client` method establishes a connection to the server and starts tasks for sending and receiving messages.\n3. **Sending Messages**: The `send_messages` method reads user input and sends it to the server.\n4. **Receiving Messages**: The `receive_messages` method listens for incoming messages from the server and prints them.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. **Run the Server**: Execute the server script. It will start listening on localhost at port 8888.\n2. **Run Multiple Clients**: Open multiple terminal windows and run the client script in each. Clients can now send messages to each other through the server.\n\nThis setup provides a basic real-time chat system using asyncio for asynchronous I/O handling, making it efficient for handling multiple connections concurrently."
