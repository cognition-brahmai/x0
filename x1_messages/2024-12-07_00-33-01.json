        "content": "So you've got a coin, and you're going to toss it twice. You want to know the probability of getting at least one head in those two tosses. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what \"at least one head\" means. It means that in your two tosses, you could get one head or two heads. It's the opposite of getting no heads at all, which would mean getting tails on both tosses.\n\nSo, one way to approach this is to calculate the probability of the opposite event\u2014getting no heads, or in other words, getting tails on both tosses\u2014and then subtract that probability from 1 to get the probability of getting at least one head.\n\nLet's consider the possible outcomes when you toss a coin twice. Each toss has two possible results: heads (H) or tails (T). So for two tosses, the possible outcomes are:\n\n1. Heads on the first toss and heads on the second toss: HH\n\n2. Heads on the first toss and tails on the second toss: HT\n\n3. Tails on the first toss and heads on the second toss: TH\n\n4. Tails on the first toss and tails on the second toss: TT\n\nThese are all equally likely outcomes, each with a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) or 0.25, since there are four possible outcomes.\n\nNow, the event \"at least one head\" includes the outcomes HH, HT, and TH. So, you can add up their probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least one head}) = P(HH) + P(HT) + P(TH) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nAlternatively, as I mentioned earlier, you can calculate the probability of getting no heads (which is TT) and subtract that from 1:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least one head}) = 1 - P(\\text{no heads}) = 1 - P(TT) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nBoth methods give you the same result: the probability of getting at least one head when tossing a coin twice is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) or 0.75, which is 75%.\n\nLet's double-check this with another approach. The formula for the probability of at least one success in multiple independent trials is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least one success}) = 1 - P(\\text{no successes}) \\]\n\nIn this case, a \"success\" is getting a head, and the probability of success on a single trial (toss) is \\( p = \\frac{1}{2} \\). The probability of failure (getting tails) is \\( 1 - p = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nSince the tosses are independent, the probability of getting tails on both tosses is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{no heads}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least one head is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least one head}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the binomial probability formula. The probability of getting exactly \\( k \\) successes in \\( n \\) independent Bernoulli trials (each with success probability \\( p \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 2 \\) tosses, \\( p = \\frac{1}{2} \\), and we want the probability of getting at least one head, which is \\( P(X \\geq 1) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) \\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( P(X = 1) \\):\n\n\\[ P(X = 1) = \\binom{2}{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^1 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{1} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( P(X = 2) \\):\n\n\\[ P(X = 2) = \\binom{2}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{0} = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nSo, \\( P(X \\geq 1) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\), which matches our previous results.\n\nYou can also consider the problem in terms of the complement rule. The complement of getting at least one head is getting no heads, which is the same as getting tails on both tosses. We already calculated that as \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). So, again, the probability of getting at least one head is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nTo visualize this, you can think of a probability tree. The first branch represents the first toss: heads or tails, each with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). From each of those, there are two branches for the second toss: heads or tails, each again with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). The end points are HH, HT, TH, and TT, each with probability \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\). Summing the probabilities of the outcomes with at least one head gives \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nIt's also worth noting that this probability assumes that the coin is fair, meaning that the probability of heads and tails is equal on each toss. If the coin were biased, the probabilities would adjust accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, this problem illustrates an important concept in probability: sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complement of the event you're interested in, especially when the event includes several possible outcomes. In this case, calculating the probability of getting no heads is simpler than individually calculating the probabilities of getting exactly one head and exactly two heads, and then summing them up.\n\nIn summary, the probability of getting at least one head when tossing a fair coin twice is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), as derived through multiple approaches including enumerating all possible outcomes, using the complement rule, and applying the binomial probability formula.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}} \\]"
