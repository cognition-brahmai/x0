        "content": "So I need to find the surface area of a sphere that has a radius of 6 inches. I remember there's a formula for this, but I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the surface area of a sphere. I think it involves the radius and pi. Hmm, I believe the formula is A equals 4 times pi times the radius squared. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm that. Yes, after checking, the formula for the surface area A of a sphere is indeed A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nOkay, so now that I have the formula, I need to plug in the value of the radius. The radius r is given as 6 inches. So, A = 4\u03c0(6)\u00b2.\n\nNext, I need to square the radius. 6 squared is 6 times 6, which equals 36. So now the formula becomes A = 4\u03c0 times 36.\n\nNow, I multiply 4 by 36. 4 times 36 is 144. So, A = 144\u03c0.\n\nWait a minute, is that the final answer? Well, it depends on whether I need to provide the answer in terms of \u03c0 or as a decimal. The question doesn't specify, so maybe both would be okay. But perhaps leaving it in terms of \u03c0 is more precise and acceptable.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also calculate the decimal approximation. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159. So, 144 times 3.14159 would give me the surface area in square inches.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 144 times 3.14159. 144 times 3 is 432, 144 times 0.1 is 14.4, 144 times 0.04 is 5.76, 144 times 0.001 is 0.144, and 144 times 0.0005 is 0.072. Adding all those up: 432 + 14.4 = 446.4, plus 5.76 = 452.16, plus 0.144 = 452.304, plus 0.072 = 452.376.\n\nSo, the surface area is approximately 452.38 square inches, if I round to two decimal places.\n\nBut again, leaving it as 144\u03c0 is also correct and perhaps more precise since \u03c0 is an irrational number.\n\nLet me double-check the formula just to be sure. Yes, the surface area of a sphere is indeed 4\u03c0r\u00b2. I think I've got it right.\n\nWait, does this make sense? Let me consider dimensions. The surface area should be in square units, and since the radius is in inches, the surface area should be in square inches. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlso, I know that for a sphere, the surface area is four times the area of a circle with the same radius. Because a sphere can be thought of as four circles put together, in a way. So, the area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, and four times that would be 4\u03c0r\u00b2, which matches the formula I'm using.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using integration, but that might be overkill for this situation. Since we're dealing with a basic geometry problem, using the standard formula should suffice.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Oh, right, the units. I need to make sure that the units are consistent. The radius is given in inches, and I'm using inches, so that's fine.\n\nAlso, I should note that this is the exact surface area. If the problem had provided any other information, like an approximation for \u03c0, I should use that. But since it didn't, I can leave it in terms of \u03c0 or use the decimal approximation.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, maybe I can also consider the formula for the surface area of a sphere derived from integration. If I consider the sphere as a series of infinitesimally small rings stacked on top of each other, the surface area can be found by integrating 2\u03c0 times the circumference of each ring from one pole to the other.\n\nBut that might be beyond the scope of this problem. Since the formula is well established, I can stick with using A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nLet me write down the steps clearly:\n\n1. Identify the formula for the surface area of a sphere: A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\n2. Plug in the value of the radius, r = 6 inches: A = 4\u03c0(6)\u00b2.\n\n3. Calculate the square of the radius: 6\u00b2 = 36.\n\n4. Multiply by 4: 4 times 36 = 144.\n\n5. So, A = 144\u03c0 square inches.\n\n6. Alternatively, for a decimal approximation, use \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159: A \u2248 144 times 3.14159 = 452.38 square inches.\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the sphere is 144\u03c0 square inches, or approximately 452.38 square inches.\n\nI think that's the answer. Unless there's more to it that I'm missing.\n\nWait, does the problem expect any specific unit conversion, like to square feet or something? No, the radius is given in inches, and the answer is in square inches, which should be fine unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144\\pi \\text{ square inches} \\approx 452.38 \\text{ square inches}} \\]"
