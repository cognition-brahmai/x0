This approach acknowledges that ecosystems provide a wide range of benefits to humans, some of which are directly usable (like fishing or tourism) and others that are not directly used but are still valued by society (such as the existence of biodiversity or the option to use the ecosystem in the future). Therefore, the correct answer is B. Total economic value."
