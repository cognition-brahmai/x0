        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. It says the diameter is 10 feet and the height is 12 feet, and I need to find the volume in cubic feet. Okay, volume of a cylinder, I think I remember that from geometry. The formula should be something like volume equals pi times the radius squared times the height. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo first, I need to find the radius. The diameter is 10 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is 5 feet. Got it. Now, plug that into the formula: volume equals pi times 5 squared times 12. Let's calculate 5 squared, that's 25. So, it's pi times 25 times 12.\n\nHmm, what's pi times 25? Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 3.1416 times 25 is... let's see, 3 times 25 is 75, and 0.1416 times 25 is, um, 0.1 times 25 is 2.5, and 0.04 times 25 is 1, and 0.0016 times 25 is 0.04. So altogether, that's 75 plus 2.5 plus 1 plus 0.04, which is 78.54.\n\nNow, multiply that by 12. So, 78.54 times 12. Well, 78 times 12 is 936, and 0.54 times 12 is 6.48. So, total volume is 936 plus 6.48, which is 942.48 cubic feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there a easier way to do this without using an approximate value for pi? Maybe I should leave pi as a symbol until the end. Let's try that.\n\nSo, volume is pi r squared h, which is pi times 5 squared times 12, which is pi times 25 times 12. That's pi times 300. So, 300 pi cubic feet. That's exact, which is better.\n\nBut the problem asks for the volume in cubic feet, so maybe they want a numerical value. If I use pi approximately equal to 3.14, then 300 times 3.14 is 942 cubic feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I use a more precise value for pi, like 3.1416, then 300 times 3.1416 is 942.48 cubic feet.\n\nHmm, maybe I should check if there's a standard value for pi to use in this context. In many engineering calculations, pi is taken as 3.14, but in more precise calculations, you might use more decimal places.\n\nGiven that the dimensions are given to the nearest foot, maybe using pi as 3.14 is sufficient. So, volume is approximately 942 cubic feet.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the units. The diameter and height are in feet, so the volume will be in cubic feet, which matches what the question is asking for.\n\nAlso, just to double-check, maybe I can use a different approach. What if I consider the area of the base first? The base is a circle with radius 5 feet, so area is pi r squared, which is pi times 25, or 25 pi square feet.\n\nThen, the volume is the area of the base times the height, which is 25 pi times 12, which again is 300 pi cubic feet.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, V = pi r squared h, and plug in the values, I get the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. So, the volume of the tank is 300 pi cubic feet, or approximately 942 cubic feet.\n\nBut to be precise, I'll keep it as 300 pi cubic feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300\\pi} \\]"
