        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: a movie theater has 15 rows with 20 seats in each row. I need to figure out how many people the theater can accommodate in total. Hmm, sounds straightforward, but let's break it down step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The theater has multiple rows, and each row has a certain number of seats. To find the total seating capacity, I should probably multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row. That makes sense because that would give me the total number of seats available in the entire theater.\n\nSo, number of rows is 15, and seats per row is 20. So, total seats would be 15 times 20. Let me calculate that.\n\n15 multiplied by 20. Well, 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 10 is another 150. So, 150 plus 150 equals 300. Therefore, the theater can accommodate 300 people.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using area or something. Like, if each seat is considered a unit, then the total area would be rows times seats per row. But in this case, since it's seating arrangements, multiplying rows by seats per row should give me the total seats.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. Is there any mention of aisles or reserved seats that might reduce the total seating capacity? The problem doesn't specify anything about aisles or reserved seats, so I'll assume that all seats are available for accommodation.\n\nAlso, it's a movie theater, so perhaps there are different sections like VIP seats or different levels. But again, the problem states that there are 15 rows with 20 seats each, so perhaps it's a single-level theater.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all rows are fully occupied or if there are any partial rows, but since the question is about the theater's total accommodation capacity, it's safe to assume that all seats are available and can be filled.\n\nSo, sticking to the initial calculation, 15 rows times 20 seats per row equals 300 seats. Therefore, the theater can accommodate 300 people.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's verify this with another method. Suppose I consider the seating arrangement as a grid, with rows and columns. Each intersection of a row and a column represents a seat. So, if there are 15 rows and 20 columns (seats per row), the total number of seats would be the product of the number of rows and the number of columns.\n\nMathematically, that's:\n\nTotal seats = number of rows \u00d7 number of seats per row = 15 \u00d7 20 = 300\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as adding the number of seats per row for each row. So, 20 seats added 15 times: 20 + 20 + 20 + ... (15 times), which again totals 300 seats.\n\nI could also consider the concept of area, where the total seating area is the product of the number of rows and the number of seats per row. In this context, it's analogous to calculating the area of a rectangle, where area equals length times width. Here, the \"length\" is the number of rows, and the \"width\" is the number of seats per row.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I keep arriving at the same conclusion: the theater can accommodate 300 people.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there might be any seating that's not available for accommodation, like perhaps seats reserved for staff or inaccessible seats. But again, the problem doesn't mention any such restrictions, so I'll assume that all seats are available for the audience.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the seating is arranged in a way that some seats might be blocked from view or if there are staggered rows, but since the problem provides a straightforward number of rows and seats per row, I'll stick with the initial calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the theater can accommodate 300 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
