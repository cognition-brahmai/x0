        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing basketball and soccer. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere are 25 students in total. Out of these, 10 play basketball, and 12 play soccer. But, 5 students play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nOkay, to approach this, I think I should first figure out how many students play at least one of the two sports. Then, I can subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play either.\n\nSo, 10 play basketball and 12 play soccer. If I just add those together, that's 10 + 12 = 22 students playing at least one sport. But wait, that counts the students who play both sports twice, once for basketball and once for soccer.\n\nBut according to the problem, 5 students play both sports. So, to avoid double-counting those students, I need to subtract the number of students who play both sports from the total who play at least one sport.\n\nSo, the number of students who play at least one sport is 10 + 12 - 5 = 17 students.\n\nNow, since there are 25 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport is 25 - 17 = 8 students.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I might be missing something.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion says that to find the total number of elements in two sets, you add the number of elements in each set and then subtract the number of elements that are in both sets.\n\nSo, in this case, the number of students who play basketball or soccer is equal to the number who play basketball plus the number who play soccer minus the number who play both.\n\nThat is: |Basketball \u222a Soccer| = |Basketball| + |Soccer| - |Basketball \u2229 Soccer|\n\nPlugging in the numbers: |Basketball \u222a Soccer| = 10 + 12 - 5 = 17 students.\n\nThen, the number of students who don't play either sport is the total number of students minus those who play at least one sport: 25 - 17 = 8 students.\n\nThat seems consistent with my first approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of Venn diagrams. I can imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents basketball players, and the other represents soccer players.\n\nThe basketball circle has 10 students, the soccer circle has 12, and the overlap between them has 5 students who play both.\n\nSo, the number of students who play only basketball is 10 - 5 = 5.\n\nThe number of students who play only soccer is 12 - 5 = 7.\n\nThen, the number of students who play at least one sport is the sum of those who play only basketball, only soccer, and both: 5 + 7 + 5 = 17 students.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total: 25 - 17 = 8 students who don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, all these methods are leading me to the same answer: 8 students.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using probabilities or something, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of students who play only basketball, only soccer, both, and neither.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Only basketball: 10 - 5 = 5 students\n\n- Only soccer: 12 - 5 = 7 students\n\n- Both sports: 5 students\n\n- Neither sport: ?\n\nNow, adding up only basketball, only soccer, and both gives us 5 + 7 + 5 = 17 students.\n\nSince there are 25 students in total, the number who play neither sport is 25 - 17 = 8.\n\nI think that's pretty much bulletproof. I've approached it from different angles, and I keep getting the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of students playing other sports or something like that, but the problem specifically mentions only basketball and soccer, and we're to find those who don't play either of these.\n\nSo, I don't think there are any hidden variables or additional considerations here.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of students who do not play either basketball or soccer is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
