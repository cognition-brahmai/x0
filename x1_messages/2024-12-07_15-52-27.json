        "content": "Let's see. The factory originally produces 150 widgets per hour. They're increasing production by 25%. So first, I need to figure out what 25% of 150 is.\n\n25% of 150 should be calculated as 0.25 multiplied by 150. Let me do that: 0.25 \u00d7 150 = 37.5. So, the production is increasing by 37.5 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, to find the new production rate, I'll add that increase to the original production: 150 + 37.5 = 187.5 widgets per hour.\n\nWait, but widgets are typically whole items, so producing half a widget doesn't make sense. Maybe I should consider if the problem allows for fractional widgets or if I need to round to the nearest whole number. But for now, I'll proceed with 187.5 widgets per hour.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many widgets are produced in 8 hours at this new rate. So, I'll multiply the hourly production by 8: 187.5 \u00d7 8.\n\nLet me calculate that: 187.5 \u00d7 8.\n\nFirst, 187 \u00d7 8 = 1496, and 0.5 \u00d7 8 = 4, so total is 1496 + 4 = 1500.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nActually, 187.5 \u00d7 8:\n\n180 \u00d7 8 = 1440\n\n7.5 \u00d7 8 = 60\n\nSo, 1440 + 60 = 1500.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, after the 25% increase, the factory produces 1500 widgets in 8 hours.\n\nBut, considering that widgets are whole items, perhaps the factory can't produce half a widget. Maybe I should consider the production rate as 187 widgets per hour, discarding the 0.5, or perhaps round it to 188.\n\nIf I discard the 0.5, then 187 \u00d7 8 = 1496.\n\nIf I round up to 188, then 188 \u00d7 8 = 1504.\n\nBut according to the calculation, it's 187.5 per hour, so over 8 hours, it's 1500 widgets.\n\nMaybe the problem allows for fractional widgets, or perhaps it's acceptable to have a decimal in the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory produces 187 widgets per hour for some hours and 188 in others to average out to 187.5.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll stick with the calculation of 187.5 widgets per hour times 8 hours equals 1500 widgets.\n\nSo, the factory produces 1500 widgets in 8 hours after the production increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1500} \\]"
