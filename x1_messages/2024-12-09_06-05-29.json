        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to figure out how many girls and boys are currently in the school.\n\nThe school has 800 students, and 60% of them are girls. So, to find the number of girls, we can calculate 60% of 800.\n\nNumber of girls = 60% of 800 = 0.60 \u00d7 800 = 480 girls\n\nNow, since the total number of students is 800, the number of boys would be:\n\nNumber of boys = Total students - Number of girls = 800 - 480 = 320 boys\n\nThe school plans to increase the number of boys by 20%. So, we need to find out what 20% of the current number of boys is and then add that to the current number of boys.\n\nIncrease in boys = 20% of 320 = 0.20 \u00d7 320 = 64 boys\n\nTherefore, the new number of boys after the increase will be:\n\nNew number of boys = Current number of boys + Increase = 320 + 64 = 384 boys\n\nNow, to find the total number of students after this increase, we add the number of girls and the new number of boys.\n\nTotal students after increase = Number of girls + New number of boys = 480 + 384 = 864 students\n\nSo, after increasing the number of boys by 20%, the school will have 864 students in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{864} \\]"
