        "content": "Certainly! Here's a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\nif num < 0:\n    print(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\nelse:\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a recursive function called `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the factorial is 1. For any other positive integer `n`, the factorial is `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`.\n\nWe then prompt the user to enter a positive integer and check if it's negative. If it's negative, we display a message saying that factorial is not defined for negative numbers. Otherwise, we calculate the factorial using the `factorial` function and display the result.\n\nYou can run this program and enter a positive integer to see its factorial calculated."
