        "content": "Alright, I have this task to create a Python Flask API with two endpoints: one for factorial calculations and another for generating Fibonacci sequences. The factorial endpoint should handle integers between 0 and 20, and the Fibonacci endpoint should handle lengths between 1 and 100. I need to make sure that there's proper input validation and that I return meaningful error messages when the inputs are invalid.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic Flask application. I'll start by installing Flask if I haven't already. I can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install Flask\n```\n\nNext, I'll create a new Python file, say `app.py`, and import the necessary modules:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n```\n\nNow, I need to define the two endpoints. Let's start with the factorial endpoint. The URL for this could be `/factorial` and it should accept a integer parameter, say `number`.\n\nI need to ensure that the input is an integer between 0 and 20. If it's not, I should return an error message. Also, factorials for negative numbers don't make sense, and factorials beyond 20 can be quite large, potentially causing issues, so limiting to 20 is reasonable.\n\nHere's a rough idea of how the endpoint could look:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/factorial', methods=['GET'])\ndef factorial():\n    try:\n        number = int(request.args.get('number'))\n        if number < 0 or number > 20:\n            return jsonify({\"error\": \"Number must be between 0 and 20\"}), 400\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, number + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return jsonify({\"result\": result})\n    except ValueError:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid input. Please provide an integer.\"}), 400\n```\n\nI'm using a simple loop to calculate the factorial here. Alternatively, I could use the `math.factorial` function, which might be more efficient.\n\nNext, the Fibonacci endpoint. Let's call it `/fibonacci` and have it accept a parameter `length` indicating how many numbers in the sequence to generate. The length should be between 1 and 100.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\nHere's a possible implementation for the Fibonacci endpoint:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/fibonacci', methods=['GET'])\ndef fibonacci():\n    try:\n        length = int(request.args.get('length'))\n        if length < 1 or length > 100:\n            return jsonify({\"error\": \"Length must be between 1 and 100\"}), 400\n        sequence = []\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for _ in range(length):\n            sequence.append(a)\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return jsonify({\"sequence\": sequence})\n    except ValueError:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid input. Please provide an integer.\"}), 400\n```\n\nIn this code, I'm generating the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified length using a loop.\n\nI should also consider what happens if the `length` parameter is not provided in the request. In that case, `request.args.get('length')` would be `None`, and trying to convert it to an integer would raise a `TypeError`. To handle this, I can add a check to ensure that the parameter is present.\n\nLet me update both endpoints to include this check:\n\nFor the factorial endpoint:\n\n```python\nnumber = request.args.get('number')\nif number is None:\n    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Missing 'number' parameter\"}), 400\ntry:\n    number = int(number)\nexcept ValueError:\n    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid input. Please provide an integer.\"}), 400\nif number < 0 or number > 20:\n    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Number must be between 0 and 20\"}), 400\n# Calculate factorial\n```\n\nSimilarly, for the Fibonacci endpoint:\n\n```python\nlength = request.args.get('length')\nif length is None:\n    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Missing 'length' parameter\"}), 400\ntry:\n    length = int(length)\nexcept ValueError:\n    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid input. Please provide an integer.\"}), 400\nif length < 1 or length > 100:\n    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Length must be between 1 and 100\"}), 400\n# Generate Fibonacci sequence\n```\n\nThis way, I'm ensuring that the parameter is present and is a valid integer within the specified range.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to handle the case where multiple parameters are provided. For example, if someone includes extra parameters in the URL. Depending on the requirement, I might choose to ignore them or return an error. For simplicity, I'll ignore any extra parameters.\n\nI should also think about the response format. I'm using JSON for both success and error responses, which is consistent and easy to understand.\n\nLet me consider edge cases for both endpoints.\n\nFor the factorial endpoint:\n\n- number = 0: factorial should be 1\n\n- number = 1: factorial should be 1\n\n- number = 20: a large number, but should be handled correctly\n\n- number > 20: return error\n\n- negative numbers: return error\n\nFor the Fibonacci endpoint:\n\n- length = 1: sequence should be [0]\n\n- length = 2: sequence should be [0, 1]\n\n- length = 100: a long sequence, but should be handled efficiently\n\n- length < 1: return error\n\n- non-integer values: return error\n\nI should also consider the performance implications. For factorials, since we're limiting to 20, it's manageable. For Fibonacci sequences, even a length of 100 is fine with an iterative approach, as it's O(n) time complexity.\n\nI might also want to add some documentation or comments in the code to make it clearer for others who might read it.\n\nFinally, I need to run the Flask application. I can do this by adding the following lines at the end of `app.py`:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nThe `debug=True` option is useful during development for automatic reloading and better error messages, but I should make sure to turn it off in a production environment.\n\nTo test the API, I can use tools like curl or Postman, or even make requests from another Python script using the requests library.\n\nFor example, to test the factorial endpoint:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:5000/factorial?number=5\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```json\n{\"result\":120}\n```\n\nAnd for the Fibonacci endpoint:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:5000/fibonacci?length=5\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```json\n{\"sequence\":[0,1,1,2,3]}\n```\n\nI should also test with invalid inputs to ensure that the error messages are returned correctly.\n\nIn summary, here's the complete code for the Flask API:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/factorial', methods=['GET'])\ndef factorial():\n    number = request.args.get('number')\n    if number is None:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Missing 'number' parameter\"}), 400\n    try:\n        number = int(number)\n    except ValueError:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid input. Please provide an integer.\"}), 400\n    if number < 0 or number > 20:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Number must be between 0 and 20\"}), 400\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, number + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return jsonify({\"result\": result})\n\n@app.route('/fibonacci', methods=['GET'])\ndef fibonacci():\n    length = request.args.get('length')\n    if length is None:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Missing 'length' parameter\"}), 400\n    try:\n        length = int(length)\n    except ValueError:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Invalid input. Please provide an integer.\"}), 400\n    if length < 1 or length > 100:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Length must be between 1 and 100\"}), 400\n    sequence = []\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(length):\n        sequence.append(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return jsonify({\"sequence\": sequence})\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nThis should fulfill the requirements of the task, providing two endpoints with proper input validation and error handling."
