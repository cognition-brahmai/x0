        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a car rental company. Let's see what it's asking. There are 12 cars, each rented out for an average of 5 days per month. The rental rate is $50 per day. I need to find out the total revenue for one year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the monthly revenue and then multiply that by 12 to get the annual revenue. Right?\n\nSo, for one car, if it's rented for 5 days at $50 per day, the monthly revenue from one car would be 5 days * $50/day = $250.\n\nNow, there are 12 cars, so the total monthly revenue would be 12 cars * $250/car = $3,000.\n\nTo find the annual revenue, I'll multiply the monthly revenue by 12 months: $3,000/month * 12 months = $36,000.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of rental days in a year for all cars and then multiply by the daily rate.\n\nFirst, each car is rented for 5 days per month, so in a year, one car is rented for 5 days/month * 12 months = 60 days.\n\nWith 12 cars, the total number of rental days in a year is 12 cars * 60 days/car = 720 days.\n\nAt $50 per day, the total revenue would be 720 days * $50/day = $36,000.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, the annual revenue is $36,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this.\n\nAre there any additional costs or variables that could impact the revenue? For example, are there maintenance costs, staffing costs, or other expenses that might reduce the net revenue?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any expenses other than the rental rate, so I think it's safe to assume that the revenue is simply the product of the number of rental days and the daily rate.\n\nAlso, it says \"each car is rented out for an average of 5 days per month.\" Does that mean that sometimes a car might be rented for more than 5 days, and sometimes less, but on average it's 5 days?\n\nRegardless, since we're given the average, we can use that to calculate the total rental days.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all cars are always available for rental, or if there are some days when they're not available, perhaps for maintenance.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify any unavailability, so I'll assume that all cars are available for rental as per the given average.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, total annual revenue is $36,000.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very low amount for a car rental company. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me see: 12 cars, each rented for 5 days per month at $50 per day.\n\nThat does seem a bit small for a car rental business. Maybe the numbers are not realistic, but perhaps that's just for this example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average of 5 days per month is not sufficient.\n\nBut according to the information provided, that's what we have to work with.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe calculate the annual revenue per car and then multiply by the number of cars.\n\nSo, one car is rented for 5 days per month at $50 per day, so monthly revenue per car is 5 * $50 = $250, as before.\n\nAnnual revenue per car would be $250/month * 12 months = $3,000.\n\nWith 12 cars, total annual revenue is 12 * $3,000 = $36,000.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36000} \\]"
