        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 5 red balls and 3 green balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. I need to find the probability of picking two red balls in a row, with replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since it's with replacement, that means after I pick the first ball, I put it back into the bag before picking the second ball. So, the total number of balls remains the same for each pick.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first try should be the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, that's 5 red balls out of 8 total balls. So, the probability for the first pick is 5/8.\n\nNow, because I'm replacing the ball, the probabilities don't change for the second pick. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second try is also 5/8.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014picking a red ball first AND picking a red ball second\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the total probability should be (5/8) * (5/8).\n\nLet me calculate that: 5 times 5 is 25, and 8 times 8 is 64. So, it's 25/64.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. In this case, since the picks are with replacement, they should be independent events.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of possible outcomes. Each pick has 8 possible balls to choose from, and since it's with replacement, there are 8 options for the first pick and 8 for the second, making a total of 8*8=64 possible outcomes.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is picking a red ball both times. There are 5 red balls, so for each pick, there are 5 favorable outcomes. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for both picks is 5*5=25.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 25/64.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard of something called dependent and independent events in probability. In this case, because we're replacing the ball, the second pick doesn't depend on the first pick, right? So, they are independent events.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, multiplying the individual probabilities is the correct approach.\n\nJust to be thorough, what if it was without replacement? Then, the probabilities would change for the second pick, right?\n\nFor example, if I pick a red ball first, there would be 4 red balls and 3 green balls left, making a total of 7 balls. So, the probability of picking a red ball second would be 4/7.\n\nSimilarly, if I pick a green ball first, there would still be 5 red balls and 2 green balls left, making 7 balls total, and the probability of picking a red ball second would be 5/7.\n\nBut since it's with replacement, I don't need to consider these scenarios.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to list all possible outcomes. Each pick can be either red or green, but since there are multiple balls of each color, the probabilities are weighted.\n\nBut I think I've confirmed it enough. The probability of picking two red balls in a row with replacement is 25/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{64}} \\]"
