        "content": "The area of the floor can be calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, for a room that's 12 meters long and 8 meters wide, the area would be 12 meters times 8 meters, which equals 96 square meters.\n\nTo find the perimeter, you add up all the sides. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, the perimeter would be twice the length plus twice the width. That's 2 times 12 meters plus 2 times 8 meters, which is 24 meters plus 16 meters, equaling 40 meters.\n\nSo, the area is 96 square meters, and the perimeter is 40 meters.\n"
