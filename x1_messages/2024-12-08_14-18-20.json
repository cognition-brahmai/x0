        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and among them:\n\n- 16 students play soccer\n\n- 20 students play basketball\n\n- 10 students play both soccer and basketball\n\nWe need to find out how many students do not play either soccer or basketball.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the two sports. To do that, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe formula for the number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\nNumber playing soccer or basketball = (Number playing soccer) + (Number playing basketball) - (Number playing both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber playing soccer or basketball = 16 + 20 - 10 = 26\n\nSo, 26 students play at least one of the two sports.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who do not play either sport, I can subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total number of students.\n\nNumber not playing either = Total students - Number playing soccer or basketball\n\nNumber not playing either = 30 - 26 = 4\n\nTherefore, 4 students do not play either soccer or basketball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to use a Venn diagram to visualize the groups.\n\nLet's imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\n- The soccer circle has 16 students.\n\n- The basketball circle has 20 students.\n\n- The overlap, where students play both sports, has 10 students.\n\nSo, the part of the soccer circle that doesn't overlap with basketball is 16 - 10 = 6 students who play only soccer.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap with soccer is 20 - 10 = 10 students who play only basketball.\n\nThen, the overlap has 10 students who play both.\n\nAdding those up: only soccer (6) + only basketball (10) + both (10) = 26 students.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total: 30 - 26 = 4 students not playing either sport.\n\nHmm, that matches my first answer. But maybe I can try another method to be extra sure.\n\nLet's consider the students who play soccer and those who play basketball, taking care not to double-count those who play both.\n\nWe can use the inclusion-exclusion principle again, but maybe more carefully.\n\nTotal students = students playing only soccer + students playing only basketball + students playing both + students playing neither.\n\nWe know:\n\n- Students playing only soccer = 16 - 10 = 6\n\n- Students playing only basketball = 20 - 10 = 10\n\n- Students playing both = 10\n\n- Total students = 30\n\nSo, plugging into the equation:\n\n30 = 6 + 10 + 10 + students playing neither.\n\nSolving for students playing neither:\n\nStudents playing neither = 30 - 6 - 10 - 10 = 4\n\nAgain, 4 students do not play either sport.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nMaybe using sets and set notation.\n\nLet S be the set of soccer players, B be the set of basketball players.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |S| = 16\n\n- |B| = 20\n\n- |S \u2229 B| = 10\n\nWe need to find the number of students not in S or B, which is the complement of S union B.\n\nFirst, find |S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B| = 16 + 20 - 10 = 26\n\nThen, the number of students not playing either is total students minus those playing at least one sport: 30 - 26 = 4\n\nConsistently getting 4 as the answer. I think it's safe to conclude that 4 students do not play either soccer or basketball.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure there are no students who play other sports or anything like that mentioned in the problem.\n\nThe problem only talks about soccer and basketball, and some students playing both, and some possibly not playing either.\n\nNo other sports are mentioned, so we don't need to consider any other groups.\n\nAlso, the numbers seem consistent: 6 play only soccer, 10 play only basketball, 10 play both, and 4 play neither, adding up to 30.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4 students do not play either soccer or basketball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
