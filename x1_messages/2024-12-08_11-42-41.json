        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. A factory produces widgets in batches of 100, and 5% of them are defective. I need to find out how many non-defective widgets there are in a batch of 200. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The factory normally makes batches of 100, but here they're making a batch of 200. So, it's twice the usual batch size. And 5% of the widgets are defective, which means the rest are non-defective.\n\nSo, if 5% are defective, then 100% - 5% = 95% are non-defective. That makes sense. So, in a batch, 95% of the widgets are good ones.\n\nNow, the batch size is 200, which is twice 100, but since the percentage is the same regardless of batch size, I think I can apply the 95% directly to the 200.\n\nLet me calculate that. 95% of 200 should give me the number of non-defective widgets.\n\nFirst, convert 95% to a decimal. 95% is 0.95.\n\nSo, 0.95 times 200 is... let's see, 0.95 * 200.\n\nWell, 0.95 * 100 is 95, so 0.95 * 200 should be 190.\n\nSo, there are 190 non-defective widgets in a batch of 200.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by first finding out how many defective widgets there are and then subtracting that from the total.\n\nLet's try that. 5% of 200 is defective.\n\nSo, 5% of 200 is 0.05 * 200, which is 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 defective widgets in the batch of 200.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-defective widgets is 200 - 10 = 190.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, either way, I get 190 non-defective widgets.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's any other factor I should consider. The problem says the factory produces batches of 100, but here it's 200. Is there any significance to the normal batch size being 100?\n\nMaybe it's just to note that 200 is twice the normal batch size, but since the percentage of defectives is the same, I don't think it affects the calculation.\n\nSo, I think 190 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
