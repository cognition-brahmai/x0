        "content": "Ah, Bengay! I've heard of that. It's one of those ointments people use for sore muscles and joints, right? So, it has methyl salicylate and menthol in it, and there's another cooling compound from mint oils. Let me think about this.\n\nMethyl salicylate, I know that's derived from wintergreen or other plants, and it has a warm, soothing feeling when you apply it. Menthol, on the other hand, gives a cool sensation, like when you breathe in eucalyptus or use some cough drops. So, both of these ingredients provide contrasting sensations that might help with pain relief.\n\nNow, about the third component from mint oils. Mints like peppermint and spearmint contain various compounds that have cooling effects. Menthol is actually one of them, but since menthol is already listed, there must be another one.\n\nI recall that mint oils contain other compounds like cineole, limonene, and maybe something called isomenthol or maybe even camphor, but I'm not sure if camphor comes from mint oils. Wait, camphor is from the camphor tree, isn't it? So maybe not.\n\nLet me see, perhaps it's cineole, also known as eucalyptol. Eucalyptus oil contains a lot of cineole, which has a cooling and refreshing scent. But eucalyptus isn't a mint, though it's in the same plant family, the Myrtaceae. So, maybe that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's methyl nicotinate, but I think that's more associated with heat rather than coolness.\n\nAnother possibility is that it's another alcohol like menthol, maybe bornyl acetate, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's simply another form of menthol, like isomenthol or neomenthol. These are optical isomers of menthol and might be present in mint oils.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a different mint oil extract that contains multiple compounds, not just menthol.\n\nLet me try to recall the ingredients list for Bengay. I think it has methyl salicylate, menthol, and something called \u00ab\u00a0wintergreen oil\u00a0\u00bb or maybe \u00ab\u00a0peppermint oil\u00a0\u00bb. But wintergreen is different from mint, as it's more related to methyl salicylate.\n\nHold on, maybe the third component is something else entirely. Perhaps it's something like camphor, which does have a cooling sensation and is sometimes found in similar products.\n\nWait, camphor is derived from the camphor tree, not from mint oils. So that might not fit the description.\n\nLet me consider the properties of the compound in question. It's a cooling agent found in mint oils, so it should be a compound that provides a cool sensation upon application to the skin, similar to menthol.\n\nMint oils contain several terpenoids and alcohols that have cooling effects. Besides menthol, peppermint oil contains menthone, isomenthone, menthyl acetate, and other related compounds.\n\nPerhaps it's menthyl acetate, which is ester derived from menthol and acetic acid. It has a cool, minty flavor and scent.\n\nAlternatively, it could be cineole, but as I thought earlier, cineole is more associated with eucalyptus.\n\nAnother option is that it's a combination of multiple compounds, but the question seems to suggest a single cooling compound besides methyl salicylate and menthol.\n\nMaybe it's isomenthol, which is an isomer of menthol and also has cooling properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's bornyl acetate, but I'm not sure if that's found in mint oils.\n\nLet me try to look this up online. [simulates searching] Oh, wait, I can't actually access the internet, can I? So, I need to rely on my knowledge base.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about the characteristics of the compound. It's found in mint oils, has a cooling effect, and is used in topical pain relief products.\n\nMint oils are known for their high menthol content, but there are other compounds that contribute to the overall cooling sensation.\n\nI've read somewhere that peppermint oil contains not only menthol but also menthone, isomenthone, neomenthol, and other related compounds.\n\nMaybe it's menthone, which is a cyclic ketone found in mint oils and has a minty flavor and cooling effect.\n\nAlternatively, it could be pulegone, but pulegone is a cyclic ether and is considered potentially carcinogenic, so it's unlikely to be used in topical ointments.\n\nWait, perhaps it's acetyl menthol, which is an ester of menthol and acetic acid, providing a longer-lasting cooling effect.\n\nAlternatively, it could be diphenhydramine, but that's an antihistamine, not a cooling compound.\n\nWait, no, that's not right.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the third component isn't a specific compound but rather a mixture of mint oils themselves, containing various cooling agents.\n\nBut the question specifies a \u00ab\u00a0cooling compound\u00a0\u00bb found in mint oils, not just \u00ab\u00a0mint oils\u00a0\u00bb in general.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's something like eucalyptol, which is present in some mint varieties.\n\nWait, eucalyptol is more characteristic of eucalyptus, but some mint species might contain it in small amounts.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should list out some common cooling compounds found in mint oils besides menthol:\n\n1. Menthone\n\n2. Isomenthone\n\n3. Neomenthol\n\n4. Menthol acetate\n\n5. Cajuput oil components (though that's more from cajeput trees)\n\n6. Camphor (from camphor trees)\n\n7. Cineole (again, more from eucalyptus)\n\nHmm, perhaps it's menthone, which is a known component of peppermint oil and has a minty, cooling taste and aroma.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's methyl salicylate again, but that's already listed as one of the main ingredients.\n\nWait, the question says \u00ab\u00a0a combination of methyl salicylate, menthol, and what cooling compound found in mint oils?\u00a0\u00bb So, it's looking for one specific compound besides methyl salicylate and menthol.\n\nI think I need to consider which compound in mint oils would complement methyl salicylate and menthol in providing additional cooling effects.\n\nGiven that menthol is the primary cooling agent in mint oils, perhaps the third component is menthone, which works synergistically with menthol to enhance the cooling sensation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different type of menthol, like neomenthol or isomenthol, which are also found in mint oils and have similar properties.\n\nAnother possibility is that it's not a specific compound but rather another ingredient like Arnica or something else, but the question specifies a cooling compound found in mint oils.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simply peppermint oil itself, considering that it contains multiple cooling compounds beyond just menthol.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest a specific chemical compound, not an oil mixture.\n\nLet me consider the structure of these compounds. Menthol is a cyclic alcohol with isopropyl and methyl groups, and menthone is its ketone counterpart, formed by oxidizing the alcohol group to a ketone.\n\nBoth have similar minty flavors and cooling effects, so maybe menthone is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's menthyl acetate, which is an ester of menthol and acetic acid, providing a cool, minty scent.\n\nI think menthyl acetate is more associated with flavorings, but it's possible it's used in topical ointments as well.\n\nWait, I recall that some topical products use a combination of menthol and menthyl acetate to prolong the cooling sensation.\n\nSo, perhaps menthyl acetate is the third component in Bengay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's isomenthol, which is an isomer of menthol and also has cooling properties.\n\nI think isomenthol is less common than menthol, but it's possible it's used in some ointments for its cooling effect.\n\nAnother option is bornyl acetate, which is found in fir trees and has a cooling, camphor-like scent, but I'm not sure if it's derived from mint oils.\n\nWait, bornyl acetate is from conifers, not mints, so that wouldn't fit.\n\nLet me consider cineole again. Cineole is present in eucalyptus oil, which is sometimes combined with mint oils in topical remedies, but again, eucalyptus isn't a mint.\n\nAlthough they belong to the same plant family, Myrtaceae, eucalyptus is not technically a mint.\n\nSo, perhaps cineole isn't the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's thymol, which is found in thyme and has some cooling properties, but thyme isn't a mint either.\n\nWait, thymol is from thyme, which is a member of the mint family, Lamiaceae, but it's not typically considered a mint.\n\nSimilarly, rosemary and sage contain cineole and other compounds, but again, they're not mints.\n\nI need to focus on compounds specifically from mint oils.\n\nMint oils, such as peppermint and spearmint, contain menthol, menthone, menthyl acetate, cineole, limonene, and other terpenoids.\n\nGiven that menthol and methyl salicylate are already listed, perhaps menthone is the missing piece.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's cineole, despite it being more associated with eucalyptus.\n\nWait, perhaps the product contains a blend of peppermint and eucalyptus oils, combining menthol from peppermint and cineole from eucalyptus for enhanced cooling effects.\n\nBut the question specifies \u00ab\u00a0mint oils\u00a0\u00bb, so eucalyptus might not qualify, even if it's sometimes combined with mints in products.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different compound altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps it's borneol, which is found in some mint species and has a cooling, camphor-like scent.\n\nBorneol is used in traditional medicines and has cooling properties.\n\nSo, maybe borneol is the third component.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's eucalyptol, which is another name for cineole, and it's present in some mint varieties.\n\nBut again, eucalyptol is more characteristic of eucalyptus.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps the answer is menthone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's carvone, which is found in some mint oils and has a minty flavor.\n\nCarvone is a component of spearmint oil, giving it its characteristic scent.\n\nHowever, carvone is more associated with spearmint, while peppermint contains more menthol and menthone.\n\nPerhaps the specific mint oil used in Bengay determines which compound is present.\n\nIf it's peppermint oil, then menthone would be a likely candidate.\n\nAlternatively, if it's spearmint oil, then carvone could be the additional cooling compound.\n\nBut I'm not sure which mint oil is used in Bengay.\n\nWait, maybe the third component isn't a specific compound but rather something like dl-camphor, which is sometimes used in topical pain relievers for its cooling sensation.\n\nHowever, camphor is derived from camphor trees, not mint oils.\n\nSo, that wouldn't fit the description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's methyl nicotinate, but that's more of a heating agent, providing warmth rather than coolness.\n\nWait, no, methyl nicotinate is a vasodilator that causes a warming sensation.\n\nSo, that's the opposite of what we're looking for.\n\nI need something that provides a cooling sensation, like menthol.\n\nLet me think about other cooling agents used in topical ointments.\n\nThere's phytol, which is a plant lipid with a cooling effect, but I don't know if it's found in mint oils.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's eucalyptol, despite it not being primary to mint oils.\n\nWait, perhaps the product uses a blend of peppermint and eucalyptus oils, combining menthol and cineole for enhanced cooling effects.\n\nIn that case, cineole could be considered the third component.\n\nBut the question specifies \u00ab\u00a0mint oils\u00a0\u00bb, and eucalyptus is not a mint, although they are related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's methyl salicylate again, but that's already listed as one of the main ingredients.\n\nWait, perhaps there are two forms of methyl salicylate, such as wintergreen-derived and mint-derived, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's another salicylate ester, like ethyl salicylate, but I don't think that's found in mint oils.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the third component is simply another form of menthol, like neomenthol or isomenthol.\n\nThese are optical isomers of menthol and have similar cooling properties.\n\nPerhaps the manufacturing process of extracting menthol from mint oils also yields these isomers, which are then included in the ointment.\n\nIn that case, neomenthol or isomenthol could be the additional cooling compound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's menthyl lactate, which is another ester of menthol, known for its cooling properties.\n\nMenthyl lactate is used in personal care products for its refreshing sensation.\n\nSo, perhaps menthyl lactate is the third component in Bengay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's synthetic menthol, which is sometimes used in place of natural menthol.\n\nBut synthetic menthol is chemically identical to natural menthol, so that probably wouldn't be considered a separate compound.\n\nWait, perhaps it's L-menthol, while the natural menthol is S-menthol, and the mixture provides a more potent cooling effect.\n\nBut again, they are the same compound, just different enantiomers.\n\nMaybe that's not the right path.\n\nLet me consider that the third component is something entirely different, like a counterirritant or a penetrant.\n\nBut the question specifies a cooling compound found in mint oils.\n\nSo, it should be a compound that not only cools but is also present in mint oils.\n\nGiven that, I think menthone is a strong candidate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's menthyl acetate.\n\nLet me see, menthyl acetate is an ester of menthol and acetic acid, and it's used in flavorings and perfumes for its minty, cooling aroma.\n\nIt's possible that it's also used in topical ointments for its cooling sensation.\n\nSo, maybe menthyl acetate is the third component in Bengay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's isomenthol, which is an isomer of menthol with similar cooling properties.\n\nI think isomenthol is less common, but it's possible it's used in some ointments.\n\nAnother option is that it's menthyl lactate, which I mentioned earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's cineole, even though it's more associated with eucalyptus.\n\nWait, perhaps the product contains a blend of peppermint and eucalyptus oils, in which case cineole would be present.\n\nBut again, eucalyptus isn't a mint, so it might not qualify as a \u00ab\u00a0cooling compound found in mint oils\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nI need to be careful with that distinction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's thymol, which is found in thyme and has some cooling properties, but thyme isn't a mint.\n\nWait, thyme is in the same family as mints, Lamiaceae, but it's not typically considered a mint.\n\nSimilarly, basil and oregano contain thymol, but again, they're not mints.\n\nSo, thymol probably isn't the answer.\n\nLet me consider other compounds found in mint oils.\n\nPeppermint oil contains small amounts of limonene, which has a citrusy scent, but not particularly cooling.\n\nSimilarly, there's caryophyllene, which has a spicy, peppery note, but not cooling.\n\nSo, those probably aren't the compounds in question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's eucalyptol, which has a cooling effect and is sometimes found in mint oils in small amounts.\n\nBut again, eucalyptol is more characteristic of eucalyptus.\n\nI think I need to settle on menthone as the most likely candidate.\n\nMenthone is a cyclic ketone found in peppermint oil and has a minty, cooling taste and aroma.\n\nIt's plausible that it's used in topical ointments like Bengay for its cooling properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's menthyl acetate.\n\nLet me see, menthyl acetate is an ester that provides a cool, minty sensation, similar to menthol.\n\nSo, it could serve as an additional cooling agent in the ointment.\n\nPerhaps the combination of methyl salicylate for warmth, menthol for cooling, and menthyl acetate for a prolonged cooling effect makes sense in a muscle relief ointment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's isomenthol or neomenthol.\n\nBut I think menthyl acetate is a more likely candidate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simply another type of mint oil, like spearmint oil, which contains different proportions of menthol, menthone, and carvone.\n\nIn that case, the third component would be spearmint oil, which contains these various compounds.\n\nBut the question seems to be looking for a specific compound, not an oil.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the essential oils of mint, but again, that's too general.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the entire mixture of mint oils, containing multiple cooling compounds, but the question seems to suggest a single compound.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the third component is camphor, which has a cooling sensation and is sometimes found in mint plants.\n\nWait, camphor is primarily obtained from camphor trees, but some mints may contain small amounts of camphor.\n\nHowever, camphor is not typically considered a major component of mint oils.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's bornyl acetate, which has a cooling, camphor-like scent and is found in some mint varieties.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAnother option is that it's eucalyptol, which has a cooling effect and is sometimes present in mint oils in small quantities.\n\nBut again, eucalyptol is more characteristic of eucalyptus.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess here.\n\nGiven that menthol is the primary cooling agent in mint oils, and menthone is another significant compound with similar properties, I'll go with menthone as the third component in Bengay.\n\nAlternatively, menthyl acetate is another plausible option.\n\nBut perhaps menthone is more commonly used in topical ointments.\n\nI need to confirm this.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look up the ingredients list for Bengay.\n\nOh, right, I can't access the internet, so I need to rely on my memory and knowledge base.\n\nLet me think about other topical ointments that contain similar ingredients.\n\nFor example, IcyHot contains menthol and camphor, but camphor isn't from mint oils.\n\nSimilarly, products like Vicks VapoRub contain turpentine, camphor, and menthol.\n\nBut again, camphor isn't from mint oils.\n\nSo, perhaps in Bengay, the third component is indeed menthone or menthyl acetate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's simply more mint oil, which contains various cooling compounds.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest a specific compound.\n\nWait, perhaps it's cineole, despite it being more associated with eucalyptus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's eucalyptol from a mint variety that contains it.\n\nI think I need to consider that some mint oils do contain cineole, especially varieties like eucalyptus mint or other hybrid mints.\n\nIn that case, cineole could be considered a cooling compound from mint oils.\n\nSo, perhaps cineole is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's menthyl lactate.\n\nWait, I think I've considered most of the possibilities.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n1. Menthone\n\n2. Menthyl acetate\n\n3. Isomenthol or neomenthol\n\n4. Cineole (eucalyptol)\n\n5. Menthyl lactate\n\nAmong these, menthone and menthyl acetate seem the most plausible, as they are both found in mint oils and have cooling properties.\n\nPerhaps menthyl acetate is the correct answer, as it's an ester that provides a longer-lasting cooling effect, which would be beneficial in a muscle relief ointment.\n\nAlternatively, menthone is a known component of peppermint oil and has a strong minty flavor and cooling sensation.\n\nGiven that, I think menthone is the most likely candidate for the third component in Bengay.\n\nTherefore, the answer is menthone.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{menthone}} \\]"
