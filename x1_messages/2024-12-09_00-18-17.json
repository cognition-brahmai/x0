        "content": "So I have this power series, \u2211 a_n * x^n, and I'm told that a_n equals (-1)^n divided by (n+1). I need to find the radius of convergence for this series. I remember that the radius of convergence is about figuring out for which values of x the series converges, and it's usually found using the ratio test or the root test. I think I'll try the ratio test here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the ratio test says. The ratio test for series convergence involves looking at the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms. So, for a series \u2211 c_n, if lim (n\u2192\u221e) |c_(n+1)/c_n| = L, then the series converges absolutely if L < 1 and diverges if L > 1.\n\nIn the context of a power series \u2211 a_n * x^n, the ratio test can be used to find the radius of convergence, R, where R is such that the series converges for |x| < R and diverges for |x| > R. The formula for R is usually given as 1 over the limit as n approaches infinity of |a_(n+1)/a_n|.\n\nGiven that a_n = (-1)^n / (n+1), let me compute a_(n+1):\n\na_(n+1) = (-1)^(n+1) / (n + 2)\n\nNow, I need to find the limit as n approaches infinity of |a_(n+1)/a_n|:\n\n|a_(n+1)/a_n| = | [(-1)^(n+1)/(n+2)] / [(-1)^n/(n+1)] | = | (-1)^(n+1)/(n+2) * (n+1)/(-1)^n | = | (-1)*(n+1)/(n+2) | = |n+1)/(n+2)|\n\nSince the (-1) terms cancel out in terms of magnitude, I'm left with |(n+1)/(n+2)|, which as n approaches infinity, this ratio approaches 1.\n\nTherefore, the radius of convergence R is 1 divided by this limit, which is 1/1 = 1.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. The formula for R is actually:\n\nR = 1 / lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_(n+1)/a_n|\n\nAnd I found that lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_(n+1)/a_n| = 1, so R = 1.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the root test. The root test for a series \u2211 c_n involves computing lim (n\u2192\u221e) |c_n|^(1/n). For a power series \u2211 a_n * x^n, this becomes lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n * x^n|^(1/n) = |x| * lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^(1/n). The series converges when this limit is less than 1.\n\nSo, for my series, I need to find lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^(1/n). Given a_n = (-1)^n / (n+1), |a_n| = 1/(n+1).\n\nThus, lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^(1/n) = lim (n\u2192\u221e) (1/(n+1))^(1/n)\n\nI know that lim (n\u2192\u221e) (1/n)^(1/n) = 1, and similarly, (1/(n+1))^(1/n) should approach 1 as n approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, using the root test, I would set |x| * 1 < 1, which again suggests that |x| < 1, so R = 1.\n\nBoth the ratio test and the root test suggest that the radius of convergence is 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check the endpoints x = 1 and x = -1 to see if the series converges there.\n\nFirst, at x = 1:\n\nThe series becomes \u2211 [(-1)^n / (n+1)] * 1^n = \u2211 [(-1)^n / (n+1)]\n\nThis is an alternating series, and since 1/(n+1) decreases to 0 as n approaches infinity, by the alternating series test, this series converges.\n\nNow, at x = -1:\n\nThe series becomes \u2211 [(-1)^n / (n+1)] * (-1)^n = \u2211 [(-1)^{2n} / (n+1)] = \u2211 [1 / (n+1)]\n\nThis is the harmonic series shifted by one term, which is known to diverge.\n\nTherefore, the series converges for |x| < 1 and also at x = 1, but diverges at x = -1. So the interval of convergence is [-1, 1], but the radius of convergence is still 1.\n\nWait, but some texts define the radius of convergence such that the series converges strictly within |x| < R, and the behavior at the endpoints is separate. In that case, R = 1 is correct, and the series converges at one endpoint but not the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the radius of convergence involving the nth root or the ratio of coefficients.\n\nAnother way to find R is using the formula:\n\nR = 1 / lim sup (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^{1/n}\n\nOr\n\nR = lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n / a_{n+1}|\n\nWait, that might be another version.\n\nActually, for power series, R = 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, which is equivalent to using the root test.\n\nIn my earlier calculation, lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^{1/n} = 1, so R = 1.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio test for sequences, R = lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n / a_{n+1}|, provided the limit exists.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n|a_n / a_{n+1}| = | [(-1)^n / (n+1)] / [(-1)^{n+1} / (n+2)] | = | (-1)^n / (n+1) * (n+2) / (-1)^{n+1} | = | - (n+2)/(n+1) | = (n+2)/(n+1)\n\nAs n approaches infinity, this ratio approaches 1. Therefore, R = 1.\n\nAll these methods confirm that the radius of convergence is 1.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compare this to a known series.\n\nThe given series is \u2211 [(-1)^n / (n+1)] x^n.\n\nThis looks similar to the alternating harmonic series when x = 1, which converges, and to the harmonic series when x = -1, which diverges. For |x| < 1, it's an alternating series with decreasing terms in magnitude, so it should converge by the alternating series test.\n\nMoreover, for |x| > 1, the terms don't approach zero, so the series diverges.\n\nTherefore, the radius of convergence is indeed 1.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
