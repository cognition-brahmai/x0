To create a Python function that checks if a number is within a given range, we need to define the function with parameters for the number and the range limits. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a range means in this context. Typically, a range is defined by two numbers: a lower bound and an upper bound. We want to check if a given number falls between these two bounds, inclusive or exclusive, depending on the requirements.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that the range is inclusive, meaning that the number is considered within the range if it is equal to either bound.\n\nHere's a basic structure for the function:\n\n```python\ndef is_in_range(number, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    if lower_bound <= number <= upper_bound:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function takes three arguments: the number to check, the lower bound of the range, and the upper bound of the range. It returns `True` if the number is within the range (inclusive), and `False` otherwise.\n\nWe can test this function with some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(is_in_range(5, 1, 10))  # Should return True\nprint(is_in_range(0, 1, 10))  # Should return False\nprint(is_in_range(10, 1, 10)) # Should return True\nprint(is_in_range(1, 1, 10))  # Should return True\nprint(is_in_range(11, 1, 10)) # Should return False\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward, but let's consider if there are any edge cases or additional features we might want.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n1. **Equal to bounds**: As mentioned, inclusive range should return `True` if the number is equal to either bound.\n2. **Bounds in reverse**: What if the lower bound is greater than the upper bound? Should the function handle this scenario?\n3. **Non-integer values**: Should the function accept floating-point numbers or only integers?\n4. **Negative numbers**: Should it handle negative numbers correctly?\n\nLet's address these one by one.\n\n#### Bounds in Reverse\n\nIf the user provides a lower bound that is greater than the upper bound, the function should still work correctly. We can handle this by ensuring that the bounds are ordered correctly within the function.\n\nHere's an updated version:\n\n```python\ndef is_in_range(number, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    lower = min(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    upper = max(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    return lower <= number <= upper\n```\n\nThis way, regardless of the order of the bounds, the function will correctly determine the range.\n\n#### Non-integer values\n\nThe function should accept floating-point numbers as well. Since the comparison operators in Python work with both integers and floats, no changes are needed.\n\n#### Negative numbers\n\nThe function should handle negative numbers without any issues, as the comparison operators work with negatives.\n\n### Additional Features\n\n1. **Exclusive range**: Sometimes, you might want to check if a number is within the range exclusively (i.e., not equal to the bounds).\n2. **Range as a tuple**: Accepting the range as a tuple instead of two separate arguments.\n3. **Verbose output**: Providing more detailed output, such as a message indicating whether the number is within the range.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities.\n\n#### Exclusive Range\n\nIf you need to check if a number is strictly within the range (exclusive), you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef is_in_range_exclusive(number, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    lower = min(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    upper = max(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    return lower < number < upper\n```\n\nThis version uses `<` instead of `<=` to make the range exclusive.\n\n#### Range as a Tuple\n\nYou can accept the range as a tuple containing two elements: the lower and upper bounds.\n\n```python\ndef is_in_range(number, range_tuple):\n    lower, upper = range_tuple\n    return min(lower, upper) <= number <= max(lower, upper)\n```\n\nThis way, you can pass the range as a single argument, which might be more convenient in some cases.\n\n#### Verbose Output\n\nIf you want the function to provide a more detailed output, you can modify it to return a string message.\n\n```python\ndef is_in_range_verbose(number, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    if min(lower_bound, upper_bound) <= number <= max(lower_bound, upper_bound):\n        return f\"The number {number} is within the range [{min(lower_bound, upper_bound)}, {max(lower_bound, upper_bound)}].\"\n    else:\n        return f\"The number {number} is outside the range [{min(lower_bound, upper_bound)}, {max(lower_bound, upper_bound)}].\"\n```\n\nThis can be useful for debugging or user feedback.\n\n### Efficiency and Best Practices\n\nThe current implementations are already quite efficient since they involve simple comparisons. However, we can make sure that the function is as clean and Pythonic as possible.\n\nUsing the `min` and `max` functions ensures that the bounds are ordered correctly without needing to write additional logic to handle reversed bounds.\n\n### Documentation\n\nIt's a good practice to include docstrings in your functions to describe what they do, their parameters, and their return values.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\ndef is_in_range(number, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a number is within a given range [lower_bound, upper_bound].\n\n    Parameters:\n    - number: The number to check.\n    - lower_bound: The lower bound of the range.\n    - upper_bound: The upper bound of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n    - True if the number is within the range, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    lower = min(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    upper = max(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    return lower <= number <= upper\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nTo ensure the function works correctly, it's important to write tests that cover various scenarios, including edge cases.\n\nHere are some test cases:\n\n```python\nassert is_in_range(5, 1, 10) == True\nassert is_in_range(0, 1, 10) == False\nassert is_in_range(10, 1, 10) == True\nassert is_in_range(1, 1, 10) == True\nassert is_in_range(11, 1, 10) == False\nassert is_in_range(5, 10, 1) == True  # Testing reversed bounds\nassert is_in_range(-5, -10, -1) == True\nassert is_in_range(5.5, 1, 10) == True  # Testing float values\n```\n\nThese tests cover normal cases, reversed bounds, negative numbers, and floating-point numbers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe've created a Python function to check if a number is within a given range, considering various scenarios and edge cases. The function is flexible and can be adapted to include additional features if needed. Always remember to document your code and write tests to ensure its correctness.\n\n### Final Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python function that checks whether a given number falls within a specified range. The range is defined by two bounds, and the function should handle cases where the bounds are provided in any order.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function `is_in_range` takes three parameters: `number`, `lower_bound`, and `upper_bound`.\n   - It determines the minimum and maximum of the bounds to handle cases where the bounds are provided in reversed order.\n   - It checks if the number lies between the minimum and maximum bounds, inclusive.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The function handles cases where the bounds are equal.\n   - It handles negative numbers and floating-point numbers.\n   - It correctly handles the case where the bounds are provided in reverse order.\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - The function uses simple comparison operations, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(1).\n\n4. **Documentation**:\n   - A docstring is included to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.\n\n5. **Testing**:\n   - Several test cases are provided to verify the correctness of the function, covering normal cases, reversed bounds, negative numbers, and floating-point numbers.\n\n#### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef is_in_range(number, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a number is within a given range [lower_bound, upper_bound].\n\n    Parameters:\n    - number: The number to check.\n    - lower_bound: The lower bound of the range.\n    - upper_bound: The upper bound of the range.\n\n    Returns:\n    - True if the number is within the range, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    lower = min(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    upper = max(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    return lower <= number <= upper\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n- **Function Logic**:\n  - By using `min` and `max`, the function ensures that the lower and upper bounds are correctly identified regardless of the order in which they are provided.\n  - The inclusive check `lower <= number <= upper` determines if the number lies within the range.\n\n- **Testing the Function**:\n  - Use various test cases to ensure the function works correctly.\n  - Example test cases:\n    - `is_in_range(5, 1, 10)` should return `True`.\n    - `is_in_range(0, 1, 10)` should return `False`.\n    - `is_in_range(10, 1, 10)` should return `True`.\n    - `is_in_range(1, 1, 10)` should return `True`.\n    - `is_in_range(11, 1, 10)` should return `False`.\n    - `is_in_range(5, 10, 1)` should return `True` (testing reversed bounds).\n    - `is_in_range(-5, -10, -1)` should return `True`.\n    - `is_in_range(5.5, 1, 10)` should return `True` (testing float values).\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is robust, handles various scenarios correctly, and is easy to understand and use."
