        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, we need to find the company's net income before taxes. To do that, we subtract the expenses from the revenue.\n\nSo, revenue is $1,200,000 and expenses are $800,000. Net income before taxes would be:\n\n$1,200,000 - $800,000 = $400,000\n\nAlright, now the company has to pay 25% tax on this net income. To find out how much tax they have to pay, we calculate 25% of $400,000.\n\n25% of $400,000 is:\n\n0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000\n\nSo, the company pays $100,000 in taxes.\n\nNow, to find the net income after taxes, we subtract the tax amount from the net income before taxes.\n\n$400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000\n\nTherefore, the company's net income after taxes is $300,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider here? Like, are there any deductions or additional expenses that might affect the net income after taxes? The question seems straightforward, but I should double-check.\n\nLet's see: revenue is $1,200,000, expenses are $800,000, and tax is 25% on net income. That seems to cover it. No mention of any other costs or income adjustments.\n\nAlright, so my calculation stands: net income after taxes is $300,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me verify the tax calculation again. 25% of $400,000 is indeed $100,000, and subtracting that from $400,000 gives $300,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300000} \\]"
