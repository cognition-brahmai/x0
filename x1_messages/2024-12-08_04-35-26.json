        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces 1000 widgets per day, and 5% of them are defective. That means the total number of defective widgets produced each day is 5% of 1000, which is 50 widgets.\n\nNow, an inspector checks 200 widgets each day and finds 12 defective ones. We need to find out what percentage of the defective widgets the inspector misses each day.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many defective widgets are there in the 200 widgets that the inspector checks. Since the overall defect rate is 5%, we might expect that 5% of the 200 widgets are defective. That would be 10 widgets (5% of 200). But the inspector finds 12 defective widgets. Hmm, that's more than expected.\n\nMaybe the selection isn't random, or there's some other factor at play. But based on the information given, the inspector finds 12 defective widgets in the 200 that are checked.\n\nNow, the total number of defective widgets produced per day is 50. The inspector finds 12 of them. So, the number of defective widgets missed by the inspector is 50 - 12 = 38.\n\nTo find the percentage of defective widgets missed, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage missed} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number missed}}{\\text{Total defective}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage missed} = \\left( \\frac{38}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 76\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the inspector misses 76% of the defective widgets each day.\n\nWait a minute, that seems really high. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal defective widgets: 5% of 1000 = 50.\n\nInspector checks 200 widgets and finds 12 defective ones.\n\nNumber missed: 50 - 12 = 38.\n\nPercentage missed: (38/50)*100 = 76%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at this. Perhaps the inspector's check is not representative of the overall defect rate, or maybe there's a sampling issue.\n\nLet me consider the inspector's find rate. The inspector checks 200 widgets and finds 12 defective ones, which is 6% (12/200*100=6%). But the overall defect rate is 5%. So, the inspector is finding a higher percentage of defective widgets than the overall rate.\n\nDoes this affect the calculation? Maybe not directly, because we're focusing on the absolute numbers of defective widgets found and missed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should consider the probability that the inspector misses defective widgets.\n\nLet's think about it in terms of probability.\n\nThe probability that a defective widget is not caught by the inspector is the number of defective widgets not checked by the inspector divided by the total number of defective widgets.\n\nThe inspector checks 200 widgets, so there are 1000 - 200 = 800 widgets not checked.\n\nOut of the 50 defective widgets, some are in the checked batch and some are in the unchecked batch.\n\nWe know that the inspector finds 12 defective widgets in the checked batch, so the number of defective widgets in the checked batch is 12.\n\nTherefore, the number of defective widgets in the unchecked batch is 50 - 12 = 38.\n\nSo, the percentage of defective widgets missed is indeed 38/50 * 100 = 76%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inspector doesn't check all the widgets, and we need to account for the probability of missing defective widgets.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the inspector only checks 200 widgets, and maybe not all defective widgets are included in those 200.\n\nLet me try a different approach using proportions.\n\nIf the inspector checks 200 out of 1000 widgets, that's 20% of the total production.\n\nIf the defective widgets are randomly distributed, then the inspector should find 20% of the defective widgets in their sample.\n\nSo, 20% of 50 is 10 defective widgets.\n\nBut the inspector finds 12, which is more than expected.\n\nThis might suggest that the defective widgets are not randomly distributed, or there's some bias in the sampling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inspector has a higher detection rate.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, we'll stick with the given numbers.\n\nGiven that the inspector finds 12 out of 50 defective widgets, the percentage missed is indeed 76%.\n\nSo, the final answer is 76%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{76\\%} \\]"
