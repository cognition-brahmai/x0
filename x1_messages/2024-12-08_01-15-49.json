        "content": "So, let's see here. There's this train that's going at a speed of 60 miles per hour. It travels for 2 hours, then stops for 30 minutes, and after that, continues for another 3 hours. I need to find out the total distance it covers.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how far it goes in each part of the journey and then add those distances up.\n\nSo, in the first part, it's going for 2 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nThen, it stops for 30 minutes. But since it's not moving during this time, it doesn't cover any distance. So, the distance during this stop is 0 miles.\n\nAfter that, it continues for another 3 hours at the same speed of 60 mph. So, for the second part:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add Distance\u2081 and Distance\u2082 together:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 120 miles + 180 miles = 300 miles\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me think again. The train goes for 2 hours at 60 mph, stops for 30 minutes, and then goes for another 3 hours at 60 mph. The stop doesn't add any distance, so indeed, only the moving times contribute to the total distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total time the train is moving. It moves for 2 hours plus 3 hours, which is 5 hours, at 60 mph.\n\nSo, Total Distance = 60 mph \u00d7 5 hours = 300 miles\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, I think 300 miles is the correct total distance traveled by the train.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, is there any acceleration or deceleration involved when the train starts or stops? But the problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I assume the speed is constant during the moving parts.\n\nAlso, the stop is 30 minutes, which is half an hour, but since the train isn't moving, it doesn't affect the distance.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the total distance is 300 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
