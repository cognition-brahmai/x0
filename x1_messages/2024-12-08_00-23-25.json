        "content": "Alright! I'm going to help you create a Node.js script that connects to a MongoDB database, creates a \"users\" collection, and inserts 10 sample user documents with random names and ages. Sound good?\n\nFirst things first, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org if you don't have it already.\n\nNext, you'll need to set up a new Node.js project. Open your terminal or command prompt, create a new directory for your project, and navigate into it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir mongo-users\ncd mongo-users\n```\n\nNow, initialize a new Node.js project by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis will create a `package.json` file with some default settings.\n\nNext, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You'll need `mongodb` for connecting to MongoDB and maybe `faker` for generating random names and ages. Let's install them:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mongodb faker\n```\n\nNow, let's create a new file called `index.js` where we'll write our script.\n\nFirst, you need to import the required modules:\n\n```javascript\nconst { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');\nconst faker = require('faker');\n```\n\nNext, you need to set up the connection to your MongoDB database. You'll need the connection string for your MongoDB instance. If you're running MongoDB locally, the connection string is usually something like `\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\"`. If you're using MongoDB Atlas or another hosting service, use the connection string provided by them.\n\nFor this example, let's assume you're running MongoDB locally:\n\n```javascript\nconst uri = \"mongodb://localhost:27017/\";\nconst client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });\n```\n\nNow, async/await is a great way to handle asynchronous operations in Node.js. Let's wrap our code in an async function:\n\n```javascript\nasync function run() {\n  try {\n    await client.connect();\n    console.log(\"Connected to MongoDB\");\n\n    const database = client.db('testDB'); // You can change 'testDB' to your desired database name\n    const usersCollection = database.collection('users');\n\n    // Create 10 sample user documents\n    const users = Array.from({ length: 10 }, () => ({\n      name: faker.name.findName(),\n      age: faker.random.number({ min: 18, max: 99 })\n    }));\n\n    // Insert the users into the collection\n    const result = await usersCollection.insertMany(users);\n    console.log(`Inserted ${result.insertedCount} users`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error:\", error);\n  } finally {\n    await client.close();\n    console.log(\"Connection closed\");\n  }\n}\n\nrun().catch(console.dir);\n```\n\nLet's break down what's happening here:\n\n1. **Connecting to MongoDB:** We connect to the MongoDB instance using the connection string.\n\n2. **Selecting the Database and Collection:** We select a database (in this case, 'testDB') and a collection named 'users'.\n\n3. **Generating Sample Users:** We use the `faker` library to generate 10 sample user documents with random names and ages.\n\n4. **Inserting Documents:** We insert these user documents into the 'users' collection using `insertMany`.\n\n5. **Error Handling and Cleanup:** We handle any errors that occur and ensure the connection is closed after operations are complete.\n\nMake sure that your MongoDB server is running before you execute this script. You can start it using the appropriate command for your operating system.\n\nTo run the script, use:\n\n```bash\nnode index.js\n```\n\nYou should see output indicating that the connection was successful, the users were inserted, and the connection was closed.\n\nThat's it! You've created a Node.js script that connects to MongoDB, creates a collection, and inserts sample user documents with random names and ages.\n\nIf you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to ask!"
