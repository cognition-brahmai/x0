        "content": "So you need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 3. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, remember that the derivative of a function gives us the rate at which the function is changing at any point. For polynomial functions like this one, we can find the derivative by applying the power rule to each term.\n\nThe power rule says that if you have a term like ax^n, where a is a constant and n is a positive integer, then the derivative is a*n*x^(n-1).\n\nLet's apply this to each term in the function.\n\nStarting with the first term, x^3.\n\nUsing the power rule:\n\nThe coefficient a is 1 (since x^3 is the same as 1*x^3), and n is 3.\n\nSo, the derivative is 1*3*x^(3-1) = 3x^2.\n\nNext, the second term, 2x^2.\n\nHere, a is 2 and n is 2.\n\nApplying the power rule: 2*2*x^(2-1) = 4x^1, which is just 4x.\n\nNow, the third term, -5x.\n\nThis can be thought of as -5x^1, so a is -5 and n is 1.\n\nDerivative: -5*1*x^(1-1) = -5*x^0 = -5*1 = -5.\n\nLastly, the constant term, +3.\n\nConstants have a derivative of zero because they don't change.\n\nSo, the derivative of 3 is 0.\n\nNow, put all the derivatives together:\n\n3x^2 + 4x - 5 + 0.\n\nThe zero doesn't affect the sum, so we can omit it.\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5.\n\nThat's the step-by-step process. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{f'(x) = 3x^{2} + 4x - 5} \\]\n"
