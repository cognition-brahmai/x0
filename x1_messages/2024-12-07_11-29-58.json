        "content": "So if someone drinks 8 cups of water every day, and we want to know how many gallons that amounts to in a month with 30 days, and given that 1 gallon equals 16 cups, we can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many cups of water the person drinks in a month. Since they drink 8 cups per day and there are 30 days in the month, I can multiply 8 by 30 to get the total cups for the month.\n\n8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups\n\nNow, I need to convert those 240 cups into gallons. Since 1 gallon is equal to 16 cups, I can divide the total number of cups by 16 to get the number of gallons.\n\n240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons\n\nSo, the person would consume 15 gallons of water in that month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. For example, I could first find out how many gallons the person drinks per day and then multiply by the number of days in the month.\n\nSo, 8 cups per day and 1 gallon is 16 cups, so:\n\n8 cups/day / 16 cups/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day\n\nThen, 0.5 gallons per day times 30 days:\n\n0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it seems like 15 gallons is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, is there a difference in cup sizes or variations in daily consumption? But according to the question, the person drinks an average of 8 cups per day, and 1 gallon is exactly 16 cups, so no need to account for variations.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the month has exactly 30 days, as specified, so no need to adjust for different month lengths.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 15 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
