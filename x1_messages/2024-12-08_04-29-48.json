It builds things up through growth and development, and it can also lay mountains low through erosion and natural processes. Over vast periods, it can dry up lakes and make things grow, whether it's plants or entire civilizations. Time is indifferent to individual lives; it doesn't care about our comings and goings. And indeed, time is unique because it is everlasting, continuing endlessly without end or beginning, at least as far as our current understanding goes.\n\nIs that what you had in mind?"
