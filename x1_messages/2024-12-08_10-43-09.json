        "content": "So I have this investment problem here. I'm supposed to find out how much $5,000 will grow to after 7 years with an annual interest rate of 4%, and it's compounded annually. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{n \\cdot t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nAlright, in this case, P is $5,000, r is 4% or 0.04, n is 1 because it's compounded annually, and t is 7 years. Plugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{1}\\right)^{1 \\times 7} \\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0.04 = 1.04 \\]\n\nSo now it's:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times (1.04)^7 \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( (1.04)^7 \\). Let me grab a calculator for this.\n\nOkay, calculating 1.04 to the power of 7:\n\n\\[ 1.04^7 \\approx 1.3159318 \\]\n\nSo, multiplying that by the principal amount:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.3159318 \\approx 6579.659 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, that would be $6,579.66.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the formula again:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{n \\cdot t} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{1}\\right)^{1 \\times 7} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times (1.04)^7 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, calculating \\( (1.04)^7 \\):\n\nLet me verify this step by step.\n\n1.04 to the power of 1: 1.04\n\nTimes 1.04: 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816\n\nTimes 1.04: 1.0816 * 1.04 \u2248 1.124864\n\nTimes 1.04: 1.124864 * 1.04 \u2248 1.16985856\n\nTimes 1.04: 1.16985856 * 1.04 \u2248 1.2166525024\n\nTimes 1.04: 1.2166525024 * 1.04 \u2248 1.265317502496\n\nTimes 1.04: 1.265317502496 * 1.04 \u2248 1.31593010255072\n\nSo, \\( (1.04)^7 \\approx 1.31593010255072 \\)\n\nMultiplying by 5000:\n\n\\[ 5000 \\times 1.31593010255072 \\approx 6579.6505127536 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: $6,579.65\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the simple interest formula to see if compound interest really makes a difference. The simple interest formula is:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + r \\times t) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 (1 + 0.04 \\times 7) \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 (1 + 0.28) \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 \\times 1.28 = 6400 \\]\n\nSo, with simple interest, the amount would be $6,400, which is less than the $6,579.65 from compound interest. That makes sense because compound interest earns interest on the accumulated interest from previous periods.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the compound interest year by year.\n\nStarting with $5,000.\n\nAfter year 1: $5,000 + (0.04 * $5,000) = $5,000 + $200 = $5,200\n\nAfter year 2: $5,200 + (0.04 * $5,200) = $5,200 + $208 = $5,408\n\nAfter year 3: $5,408 + (0.04 * $5,408) = $5,408 + $216.32 = $5,624.32\n\nAfter year 4: $5,624.32 + (0.04 * $5,624.32) = $5,624.32 + $224.9728 \u2248 $5,849.2928\n\nAfter year 5: $5,849.2928 + (0.04 * $5,849.2928) \u2248 $5,849.2928 + $233.971712 \u2248 $6,083.264512\n\nAfter year 6: $6,083.264512 + (0.04 * $6,083.264512) \u2248 $6,083.264512 + $243.33058048 \u2248 $6,326.59509248\n\nAfter year 7: $6,326.59509248 + (0.04 * $6,326.59509248) \u2248 $6,326.59509248 + $253.0638037 \u2248 $6,579.65889618\n\nRounding to two decimal places: $6,579.66\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct amount.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the compound interest formula for annual compounding, which is:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nSince n=1, it simplifies to that.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ A = 5000 (1 + 0.04)^7 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 5000 (1.04)^7 \\]\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the interest was compounded more frequently, say quarterly or monthly, but the problem specifies annual compounding, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the interest rate is indeed 4% per year, compounded annually, and that there are no other fees or conditions mentioned. The problem seems straightforward, so I can proceed with the calculation as is.\n\nIn conclusion, after 7 years, an investment of $5,000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded annually, will be worth approximately $6,579.66.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6579.66} \\]"
