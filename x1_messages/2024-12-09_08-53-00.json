        "content": "So there are 120 passengers on the train. Half of them have window seats, and one-third have aisle seats. I need to find out how many have neither a window nor an aisle seat.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many passengers have window seats. Half of 120 is 60, so 60 passengers have window seats.\n\nNext, one-third of the passengers have aisle seats. One-third of 120 is 40, so 40 passengers have aisle seats.\n\nNow, if I add the passengers with window seats and those with aisle seats, that's 60 + 40 = 100 passengers.\n\nBut wait, maybe some passengers have both window and aisle seats. If that's the case, then adding 60 and 40 would count those passengers twice. So, I need to know if there's any overlap between window and aisle seats.\n\nIn a typical train carriage, window seats are along the sides, and aisle seats are along the aisle. So, generally, a seat is either a window seat or an aisle seat, but not both. So, I think there's no overlap.\n\nTherefore, the total number of passengers with either window or aisle seats is 100.\n\nSince there are 120 passengers in total, the number of passengers who have neither a window nor an aisle seat is 120 - 100 = 20.\n\nSo, the answer should be 20 passengers.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs it possible that some seats are both window and aisle seats? In some train configurations, maybe there are seats that are next to the window and next to the aisle, but in most standard train setups, window seats are distinct from aisle seats.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any passengers without seats, but the problem says all passengers have seats, I assume.\n\nWait, the problem says \"half of the passengers have a window seat, and one-third of the passengers have an aisle seat.\" It doesn't specify if these are exclusive or if there's any overlap.\n\nTo be safe, I should assume that window and aisle seats are distinct, unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, with that assumption, the calculation stands: 60 window, 40 aisle, total 100, out of 120, so 20 have neither.\n\nAlternatively, if there is an overlap, the number of passengers with either window or aisle seats would be less than 100, which would increase the number of passengers with neither.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify any overlap, and in standard seating arrangements, window and aisle seats are separate, I think it's safe to assume no overlap.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 passengers have neither a window nor an aisle seat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
