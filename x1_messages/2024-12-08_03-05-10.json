The expression is:\n\n(4^2 * 3) / 2 + 5 * (9 - 4)\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n9 - 4 = 5\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(4^2 * 3) / 2 + 5 * 5\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(16 * 3) / 2 + 5 * 5\n\nNow, multiplication and division from left to right:\n\nFirst, 16 * 3 = 48\n\nThen, 48 / 2 = 24\n\nNext, 5 * 5 = 25\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n24 + 25\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n24 + 25 = 49\n\nSo the final answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]"
