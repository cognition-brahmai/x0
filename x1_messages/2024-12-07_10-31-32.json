        "content": "So, if a car is going at a steady 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, we wanna know how far it goes in kilometers. First, I need to figure out how many miles it travels in that time, and then convert that to kilometers.\n\nOkay, speed is 60 miles per hour, and time is 3 hours. Distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So, 60 mph times 3 hours should give me the distance in miles.\n\nLet me calculate that: 60 times 3 is 180. So, the car travels 180 miles.\n\nNow, I need to convert miles to kilometers. The conversion factor is 1 mile equals about 1.60934 kilometers. So, to get kilometers, I multiply the number of miles by this conversion factor.\n\nSo, 180 miles times 1.60934 kilometers per mile.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 180 times 1.60934.\n\nFirst, 180 times 1.6 is 288.\n\nThen, 180 times 0.09 is 16.2.\n\nNext, 180 times 0.00934 is, let's see, 180 times 0.009 is 1.62, and 180 times 0.00034 is 0.0612.\n\nSo, adding all those up: 288 plus 16.2 is 304.2, plus 1.62 is 305.82, plus 0.0612 is 305.8812.\n\nSo, the car travels approximately 305.88 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a calculator for this. Let me assume I have one handy.\n\nSo, 180 times 1.60934 equals 289.6812.\n\nWait, that doesn't match what I had earlier. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my mental math.\n\nLet me break it down again.\n\n180 times 1 is 180.\n\n180 times 0.6 is 108.\n\n180 times 0.00934 is 1.6812.\n\nWait, no. Let's properly multiply 180 by 1.60934.\n\nActually, perhaps it's better to do it step by step.\n\n180 times 1 is 180.\n\n180 times 0.6 is 108.\n\n180 times 0.009 is 1.62.\n\n180 times 0.0003 is 0.054.\n\n180 times 0.00004 is 0.0072.\n\nNow, adding those up: 180 plus 108 is 288, plus 1.62 is 289.62, plus 0.054 is 289.674, plus 0.0072 is 289.6812.\n\nSo, the total distance in kilometers is 289.6812 km.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 305 something, which was wrong. So, the correct distance is approximately 289.68 kilometers.\n\nLet me confirm this again. If the car travels at 60 mph for 3 hours, that's 180 miles. And 180 miles times 1.60934 km per mile equals 289.6812 km.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the car will travel approximately 289.68 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{289.68 \\text{ km}} \\]"
