Each stage of your plan should be associated with an evidence value, which will represent the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, earlier evidence values, or both.\n\nThese are the tools you can employ:\n1. AskJeeves[input]: This tool allows the user to perform an internet search using the Ask Jeeves search engine. It provides a list of potential websites that may contain the answer to the user's query.\n2. ContentScraper[input]: This function loads one or more websites from the input string (which contains newline-separated links) and returns the textual content of these sites.\n3. LinkMiner[input]: This tool extracts links from plain text and outputs them as a newline-separated list.\n4. InfoProcessor[input]: An AI-powered language model capable of answering questions based on an input text passage. The input should be a question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nYour output should adhere to the following structure:\nPlan: [Initial action based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Subsequent action based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function call with input parameter, potentially referring back to previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the ultimate response]\n\nQuestion: How does the process of photosynthesis work and why is it important for life on Earth?"
