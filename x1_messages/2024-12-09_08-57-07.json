        "content": "That's a great question! The famous 19th-century painting 'Starry Night' was created by the Dutch post-impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh. He painted it while he was staying at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France, in 1889. Van Gogh had voluntarily admitted himself to this asylum after experiencing mental health struggles and facing personal crises. Despite his challenging circumstances, he continued to create some of his most iconic works during this time, 'Starry Night' being one of them. The painting is renowned for its swirling sky, bold colors, and emotional depth, showcasing van Gogh's unique style and profound connection to nature."
