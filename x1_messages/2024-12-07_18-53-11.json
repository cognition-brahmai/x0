Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the car drives at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour (mph) for 3 hours. To find out how far it goes in that time, you can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, for the first part of the trip:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance}_1 = 50 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance}_1 = 150 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nOkay, so the car covers 150 miles in the first 3 hours.\n\nNext, the car increases its speed to 70 mph and continues at this speed for another 2 hours. Again, we'll use the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance}_2 = 70 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance}_2 = 140 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nSo, in the next 2 hours, the car covers 140 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance covered during the entire trip, we just need to add up the distances from each part of the trip:\n\n\\[ \\text{total distance} = \\text{distance}_1 + \\text{distance}_2 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\n\\[ \\text{total distance} = 150 \\, \\text{miles} + 140 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{total distance} = 290 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the car covers a total distance of 290 miles.\n\nJust to make sure we didn't make any mistakes, let's double-check our calculations.\n\nFirst part:\n\n50 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 150 miles \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond part:\n\n70 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 140 miles \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal distance:\n\n150 miles + 140 miles = 290 miles \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. So, the final answer is 290 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{290} \\]"
