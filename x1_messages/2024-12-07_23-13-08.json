        "content": "So I've got this revenue function, R(x) = 200x - x\u00b2, and I need to find the maximum revenue the company can achieve by selling x number of items. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that revenue is typically the amount of money earned from selling products or services. Here, it's given as a function of the number of items sold, x. So, R(x) represents how much money the company makes by selling x items.\n\nLooking at the function, R(x) = 200x - x\u00b2, I notice it's a quadratic equation. Quadratic functions usually graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative (-1), this parabola opens downwards. That means it has a maximum point, which is the vertex of the parabola.\n\nSo, to find the maximum revenue, I need to find the vertex of this parabola. There are a few ways to do this. One way is to use the vertex formula for a quadratic function in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, which is x = -b/(2a).\n\nIn this case, a = -1 and b = 200. Plugging these into the vertex formula:\n\nx = -200 / (2 * -1) = -200 / -2 = 100\n\nSo, the number of items that need to be sold to achieve maximum revenue is 100.\n\nBut, the question asks for the maximum revenue, not the number of items. So, I need to plug x = 100 back into the revenue function to find R(100).\n\nR(100) = 200*(100) - (100)\u00b2 = 20000 - 10000 = 10000\n\nTherefore, the maximum revenue the company can achieve is 10,000 currency units (assuming the revenue is in dollars, euros, etc.).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to confirm this result. Perhaps I can take the derivative of the revenue function and set it to zero to find the maximum.\n\nSo, the derivative of R(x) with respect to x is:\n\nR'(x) = d/dx (200x - x\u00b2) = 200 - 2x\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n200 - 2x = 0\n\n2x = 200\n\nx = 100\n\nAgain, x = 100 is the critical point. To confirm it's a maximum, I can take the second derivative:\n\nR''(x) = d/dx (200 - 2x) = -2\n\nSince R''(x) = -2, which is less than zero, this confirms that x = 100 is a maximum point.\n\nSo, plugging x = 100 back into R(x):\n\nR(100) = 200*100 - 100\u00b2 = 20000 - 10000 = 10000\n\nYep, same result as before.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe by completing the square for the quadratic function.\n\nStarting with R(x) = -x\u00b2 + 200x (rearranged for completing the square).\n\nTo complete the square:\n\n1. Factor out the coefficient of x\u00b2, which is -1:\n\nR(x) = - (x\u00b2 - 200x)\n\n2. Take half of the coefficient of x, which is -200, divided by 2 is -100, then square it: (-100)\u00b2 = 10000.\n\n3. Add and subtract this square inside the parentheses:\n\nR(x) = - (x\u00b2 - 200x + 10000 - 10000)\n\n4. Rearrange:\n\nR(x) = - ( (x - 100)\u00b2 - 10000 )\n\n5. Distribute the negative sign:\n\nR(x) = - (x - 100)\u00b2 + 10000\n\nSo, the revenue function can be written as R(x) = - (x - 100)\u00b2 + 10000.\n\nFrom this form, it's clear that the maximum revenue is 10,000, achieved when (x - 100)\u00b2 = 0,\u5373 x = 100.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: the maximum revenue is 10,000 currency units when 100 items are sold.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any constraints on x. For example, can the company sell a negative number of items? Probably not, so x \u2265 0.\n\nAlso, presumably, the company can't sell more than a certain number of items due to production limits, but since no upper limit is given, I'll assume x can be any non-negative integer.\n\nHowever, since the parabola opens downwards and the vertex is at x = 100, and x \u2265 0, the maximum revenue is indeed at x = 100.\n\nLet me also consider if there's a possibility of selling fractional items, but since items are typically discrete, x should probably be an integer. But since the function is continuous, and the maximum is at x = 100, which is an integer, it shouldn't make a difference.\n\nAlternatively, if x could be a non-integer, the maximum would still be at x = 100, since the function is continuous and differentiable.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the maximum revenue the company can achieve is 10,000 currency units by selling 100 items.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10000} \\]"
