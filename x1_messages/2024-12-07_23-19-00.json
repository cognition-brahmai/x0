Please note that this is a fictional creation and not an actual song by David Bowie.)\n\n**Starman's Lament**\n\nIn the quiet of the night, when the stars are bright and clear,\nI hear a whisper in the darkness, a voice that seems to yearn.\nIt's the echo of a traveler, from a world beyond our own,\nSailing through the cosmos, on a journey never done.\n\nChorus:\nOh, Starman, wandering so far,\nThrough the vast expanse, without a map or a star.\nWith your electric heart and your neon glow,\nYou're a creature of the night, where the spirits softly flow.\n\nVerse 1:\nHe left his home among the clouds, where the skies were painted gold,\nEscaped the gravity that held him down, to the fields of stars untold.\nWith a satellite of love, and a guitar that plays the sky,\nHe's a modern-day astro-vaudevillian, under the moon's gentle eye.\n\nChorus:\nOh, Starman, dancing in the void,\nWhere the blackest nights are your only load.\nWith your alien tongue and your cosmic sigh,\nYou're a ghost in the machine, floating by.\n\nBridge:\nHe sees the Earth from up above, a blue and green marble spinning slow,\nReflects on the dreams and the follies, of the mortals down below.\nWith a plastic soul and a burning heart, he sends signals to the earth,\nHoping someone hears his call, in this infinite, silent birth.\n\nChorus:\nOh, Starman, lost in the ether,\nSearching for a place that's neverether.\nWith your Ziggy Stardust mane and your Spiders from Mars,\nYou're the avatar of the unknown, in the firmament's vast sprawl.\n\nOutro:\nSo here's to the Starman, forever adrift,\nTo the travelers of the universe, with their hopes and their gifts.\nMay they find their way back home, or discover new skies,\nIn the endless ballet of the heavens, under the watchful eyes.\n\n**End of Ballad**"
