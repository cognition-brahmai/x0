        "content": "Let's see here. So we have two trains, one leaving from Station A heading to Station B, and the other leaving from Station B heading to Station A. The distance between the two stations is 200 miles. Train A is going at 60 miles per hour, and Train B is going at 40 miles per hour. We need to figure out when they meet, and then determine which train is closer to Station A at that moment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. They're asking which train will be closer to Station A when they meet. But actually, when two trains are moving towards each other and meet at a certain point, at that exact moment, both trains are at the same location, right? So, technically, they are equally close to Station A at the point they meet.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. If they meet at a certain point, say x miles from Station A, then Train A would have traveled x miles, and Train B would have traveled 200 - x miles. But since they started at the same time and met at the same time, the time taken by both trains to reach the meeting point should be the same.\n\nSo, time = distance / speed.\n\nFor Train A: time = x / 60\n\nFor Train B: time = (200 - x) / 40\n\nSince the times are equal, we can set up the equation:\n\nx / 60 = (200 - x) / 40\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n40x = 60(200 - x)\n\n40x = 12000 - 60x\n\n40x + 60x = 12000\n\n100x = 12000\n\nx = 120 miles\n\nSo, they meet 120 miles from Station A.\n\nTherefore, Train A has traveled 120 miles, and Train B has traveled 80 miles (200 - 120 = 80).\n\nNow, the question is, which train is closer to Station A when they meet? Well, at the meeting point, both trains are at the same location, 120 miles from Station A. So, both are equally close to Station A at that moment.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the question is trying to trick me or something. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the term \"closer to Station A.\" Maybe it's referring to which train has come from Station A, or something like that. But no, the question clearly states that when they meet, which train is closer to Station A.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a trick question related to relative speeds or something. Let me consider the speeds again.\n\nTrain A is going at 60 mph, Train B at 40 mph. They start at the same time from their respective stations and meet after some time t.\n\nWe have:\n\nDistance covered by Train A: 60t\n\nDistance covered by Train B: 40t\n\nTotal distance covered: 60t + 40t = 100t\n\nThis must equal the initial distance between the stations, which is 200 miles.\n\nSo, 100t = 200\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nSo, they meet after 2 hours.\n\nIn 2 hours, Train A has traveled 60 * 2 = 120 miles\n\nTrain B has traveled 40 * 2 = 80 miles\n\nSo, they meet 120 miles from Station A, which is also 80 miles from Station B.\n\nBut again, at the meeting point, both trains are at the same location, so they are equally close to Station A.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about which train has less distance remaining to Station A after they meet. But no, the question is \"when they meet, which train will be closer to Station A?\"\n\nAt the meeting point, both are at the same point, so they are equally close to Station A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the term \"closer to Station A.\" Maybe it's considering the destination or something. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we consider that after they meet, they continue to their destinations. Then, which train has less distance to Station A. But the question specifically says \"when they meet,\" so perhaps that's not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the directions. Let me double-check the directions.\n\nTrain A is leaving from Station A heading to Station B.\n\nTrain B is leaving from Station B heading to Station A.\n\nSo, they are moving towards each other.\n\nWhen they meet, they are at the same point.\n\nTherefore, they are equally close to Station A at that moment.\n\nWait, maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking about which train has come from which station, but no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the speeds or something. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nTotal distance: 200 miles\n\nSpeed of Train A: 60 mph\n\nSpeed of Train B: 40 mph\n\nRelative speed: 60 + 40 = 100 mph\n\nTime to meet: 200 / 100 = 2 hours\n\nDistance covered by Train A: 60 * 2 = 120 miles\n\nDistance covered by Train B: 40 * 2 = 80 miles\n\nSo, they meet 120 miles from Station A.\n\nAt that point, both trains are at the same location, 120 miles from Station A.\n\nTherefore, neither is closer; they are at the same location.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that one train has come from Station A and one from Station B, and \"closer to Station A\" might refer to which train has traveled less distance from Station A.\n\nBut in that case, Train A has traveled 120 miles from Station A, while Train B has traveled 80 miles from Station B but is now at 120 miles from Station A.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAt the meeting point:\n\nTrain A has traveled 120 miles from Station A.\n\nTrain B has traveled 80 miles from Station B.\n\nBut both are at the same point, 120 miles from Station A.\n\nSo, from Station A, both trains are 120 miles away at the meeting point.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since they meet at 120 miles from Station A, both trains are at that point, so the distance from Station A for both is 120 miles.\n\nTherefore, they are equally close to Station A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about which train has less distance remaining to Station A after the meeting.\n\nBut the question is \"when they meet, which train will be closer to Station A?\"\n\nAt the meeting point, both are at the same location, so they are equally close to Station A.\n\nI think the answer is that both trains are equally close to Station A when they meet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Both trains are equally close to Station A when they meet.}} \\]"
