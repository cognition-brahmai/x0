If each corn plant requires 2 square meters and each wheat plant requires 3 square meters, how many plants of each type can he grow?"

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to find out the total area of the farmer's field. The field is rectangular, and I know its length and width, so area should be length times width, right?\n\nSo, area equals 200 meters times 150 meters, which is 30,000 square meters. Now, the farmer wants to plant corn on half of the field and wheat on the other half. Half of 30,000 is 15,000 square meters for each crop.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how many corn plants and wheat plants can be grown in their respective areas. Each corn plant requires 2 square meters, so the number of corn plants should be the area for corn divided by the area per corn plant. That's 15,000 square meters divided by 2 square meters per plant, which equals 7,500 corn plants.\n\nSimilarly, each wheat plant requires 3 square meters, so the number of wheat plants is the area for wheat divided by the area per wheat plant. That's 15,000 square meters divided by 3 square meters per plant, which equals 5,000 wheat plants.\n\nWait a minute, does that add up? Let me double-check my calculations. Total area is length times width: 200 times 150 is indeed 30,000 square meters. Half of that is 15,000 square meters for each crop.\n\nFor corn: 15,000 divided by 2 is 7,500 plants.\n\nFor wheat: 15,000 divided by 3 is 5,000 plants.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But maybe I should consider if there's any space needed between the plants or if the entire area is usable. The problem doesn't mention any pathways or unusable space, so I'll assume the entire area can be used for planting.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if the farmer is planting only one row of each crop or multiple rows. But since it's a rectangular field and he's dividing it in half, perhaps he's planting one large section of corn and one of wheat. Again, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll stick with the initial approach.\n\nLet me think about units to make sure I haven't mixed them up. The field is in meters, and the area is in square meters, which matches the requirements for the plants, also in square meters. So, units are consistent.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider, like the growing season or crop yield? The problem doesn't provide information on that, so I don't think it's relevant for this calculation.\n\nAlright, based on this, the farmer can grow 7,500 corn plants and 5,000 wheat plants.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe farmer can grow \\boxed{7500} corn plants and \\boxed{5000} wheat plants.\n"
