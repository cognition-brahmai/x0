        "content": "So you've got this problem here about buying candies, right? There are two types: Type A costs $2 per piece and Type B costs $3 per piece. You want to spend exactly $50 on these candies. The question is, how many pieces of each type should you buy to make that total?\n\nFirst off, this seems like a problem involving some kind of equation, probably related to the total cost. Let me think about how to set this up.\n\nLet's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Type A candies.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Type B candies.\n\nSince Type A costs $2 each, the total cost for Type A candies would be \\( 2x \\).\n\nSimilarly, Type B costs $3 each, so the total cost for Type B candies would be \\( 3y \\).\n\nThe total amount to be spent is $50, so the equation would be:\n\n\\[ 2x + 3y = 50 \\]\n\nNow, I need to find non-negative integer values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy this equation because you can't buy a negative number of candies, and you can't buy half a candy; it has to be whole numbers.\n\nThis is what's known as a linear Diophantine equation, where I'm looking for integer solutions.\n\nOne way to approach this is to solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nLet's solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 2x = 50 - 3y \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{50 - 3y}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\( x \\) to be an integer, \\( 50 - 3y \\) must be even because it's divided by 2.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about possible values for \\( y \\) that make \\( 50 - 3y \\) divisible by 2.\n\nBut actually, since 50 is even and 3y is either even or odd depending on y, but 3y is always a multiple of 3, which could be even or odd.\n\nWait, 3y is odd if y is odd, and even if y is even.\n\nSo, 50 is even, minus an even number (if y is even) remains even, and minus an odd number (if y is odd) becomes odd.\n\nTherefore, \\( 50 - 3y \\) is even only if y is even, because subtracting an even number from an even number gives even, and subtracting an odd number from an even number gives odd.\n\nSo, y must be even for \\( x \\) to be an integer.\n\nSimilarly, since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) have to be non-negative integers (you can't buy negative candies), I need to find even values of \\( y \\) such that \\( x \\) is also non-negative.\n\nLet me find the possible values for \\( y \\):\n\nSince y is even, let's set \\( y = 2k \\), where \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{50 - 3(2k)}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{50 - 6k}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 3k \\]\n\nNow, since \\( x \\) must be non-negative:\n\n\\[ 25 - 3k \\geq 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 25 \\geq 3k \\]\n\n\\[ k \\leq \\frac{25}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ k \\leq 8.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer, the maximum value for \\( k \\) is 8.\n\nAlso, \\( k \\) must be greater than or equal to 0.\n\nSo, \\( k \\) can be any integer from 0 to 8 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's list out the possible values:\n\nFor \\( k = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 2(0) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 3(0) = 25 \\]\n\nSo, 25 Type A candies and 0 Type B candies.\n\nFor \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 2(1) = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 3(1) = 22 \\]\n\nSo, 22 Type A candies and 2 Type B candies.\n\nFor \\( k = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 6 = 19 \\]\n\n19 Type A and 4 Type B.\n\nFor \\( k = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 6 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 9 = 16 \\]\n\n16 Type A and 6 Type B.\n\nFor \\( k = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 12 = 13 \\]\n\n13 Type A and 8 Type B.\n\nFor \\( k = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 10 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 15 = 10 \\]\n\n10 Type A and 10 Type B.\n\nFor \\( k = 6 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 12 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 18 = 7 \\]\n\n7 Type A and 12 Type B.\n\nFor \\( k = 7 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 14 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 21 = 4 \\]\n\n4 Type A and 14 Type B.\n\nFor \\( k = 8 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 16 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 - 24 = 1 \\]\n\n1 Type A and 16 Type B.\n\nSo, these are all the possible combinations of Type A and Type B candies that add up to exactly $50.\n\nLet me just double-check one of them to make sure.\n\nTake, for example, \\( x = 10 \\), \\( y = 10 \\):\n\nCost would be \\( 2*10 + 3*10 = 20 + 30 = 50 \\). Perfect.\n\nAnother one: \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y = 14 \\):\n\n\\( 2*4 + 3*14 = 8 + 42 = 50 \\). Correct.\n\nAnd one more: \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 16 \\):\n\n\\( 2*1 + 3*16 = 2 + 48 = 50 \\). Yes.\n\nSo, all these combinations work.\n\nNow, the problem doesn't specify if there's only one correct answer or if there are multiple possibilities. From what I've found, there are 9 possible combinations where you buy a certain number of Type A and Type B candies to spend exactly $50.\n\nUnless there are additional constraints, like buying a certain number of candies in total or minimizing the number of candies, all these combinations are valid solutions.\n\nIf there were additional constraints, I would need to consider those to find the specific solution required.\n\nBut based on the information given, any of these combinations would satisfy the condition of spending exactly $50 on candies.\n\nSo, to answer the question: there are multiple possible numbers of each type of candy that can be bought to spend exactly $50, as long as the total cost equals $50.\n\nSpecifically, the possible combinations are:\n\n- 25 Type A and 0 Type B\n\n- 22 Type A and 2 Type B\n\n- 19 Type A and 4 Type B\n\n- 16 Type A and 6 Type B\n\n- 13 Type A and 8 Type B\n\n- 10 Type A and 10 Type B\n\n- 7 Type A and 12 Type B\n\n- 4 Type A and 14 Type B\n\n- 1 Type A and 16 Type B\n\nThat's a total of 9 different ways to spend exactly $50 on these candies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{cc}\n\\text{Type A} & \\text{Type B} \\\\\n25 & 0 \\\\\n22 & 2 \\\\\n19 & 4 \\\\\n16 & 6 \\\\\n13 & 8 \\\\\n10 & 10 \\\\\n7 & 12 \\\\\n4 & 14 \\\\\n1 & 16 \\\\\n\\end{array} } \\]"
