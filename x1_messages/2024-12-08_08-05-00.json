        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 6 red balls and 4 blue balls. I need to find the probability of picking a red ball followed by a blue ball, and the condition is that I put the first ball back before picking the second one. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of balls in the bag. There are 6 red and 4 blue, so total balls are 6 + 4 = 10 balls.\n\nNow, since I'm picking with replacement, that means the first pick doesn't affect the second pick because I'm putting the ball back. So, each pick is independent of the other.\n\nI need to find the probability of two events happening in sequence: first picking a red ball, and then picking a blue ball.\n\nSince these are independent events, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 6/10.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball second is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 4/10.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening is (6/10) * (4/10).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(6/10) * (4/10) = (6 * 4) / (10 * 10) = 24 / 100.\n\nI can simplify 24/100 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives 6/25.\n\nSo, the probability is 6/25.\n\nWait, but I should check if I've missed anything. Is there any other way to approach this problem to confirm my answer?\n\nAnother way is to consider the sample space. Since picks are independent and with replacement, the total number of possible outcomes for two picks is 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick a red first and then a blue. There are 6 ways to pick red first and 4 ways to pick blue second, so 6 * 4 = 24 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 24/100, or 6/25 again.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor to consider. The problem says \"randomly pick one ball from the bag and then put it back before picking another.\" So, yes, with replacement, independent events.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{6}{25}} \\]"
