        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 people in the room, including me. First, I shake hands with everyone except myself. So, I shake hands with 9 people. Then, each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. Wait, but isn't that including the handshakes I already did?\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. The total number of handshakes when everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once is given by the combination formula, right? Like, how many ways to choose 2 people out of 10 to shake hands.\n\nSo, that would be C(10,2), which is 45. But wait, I already shook hands with 9 people. So, does that mean those 9 handshakes are already included in the 45?\n\nActually, no. Because the 45 includes all possible handshakes among the 10 people, not just the ones I did. So, maybe I don't need to subtract anything.\n\nLet me try another approach. If there are 10 people and each shakes hands with every other person exactly once, then the total number of handshakes is indeed C(10,2) = 45.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased, it says \"you shake hands with everyone except yourself. Then each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\" It sounds like maybe I'm supposed to add the handshakes I did separately.\n\nWait, that might be confusing. If I shake hands with everyone except myself, that's 9 handshakes. Then, \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\" But that includes the handshakes I already did.\n\nSo, maybe the total is just C(10,2) = 45, and the first part is just setting up that I shook hands with everyone, which is already included in the total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"then each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once\" is meant to describe the entire scenario, not just what happens after I shake hands with everyone.\n\nMaybe I should consider it as two parts:\n\n1. I shake hands with everyone except myself (9 handshakes).\n\n2. Each of the 10 people shakes hands with every other person exactly once (which is 45 handshakes).\n\nBut if I add those, that would be 9 + 45 = 54 handshakes, which doesn't make sense because the 9 are already included in the 45.\n\nThis seems confusing. Perhaps the first part is just\u5f3a\u8c03that I shake hands with everyone, and the second part is that everyone else also shakes hands with each other.\n\nWait, but in the second part, \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" which includes me shaking hands with others and them shaking hands with each other.\n\nSo, perhaps the total is just C(10,2) = 45 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way it's phrased, \"you shake hands with everyone except yourself. Then each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" is meant to indicate that the handshakes I did are separate from the handshakes that happen between everyone else.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because if everyone shakes hands with every other person exactly once, then my handshakes are already included.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I need to think of it differently.\n\nLet me consider that the total number of unique handshakes in a group of 10 people, where each pair shakes hands exactly once, is C(10,2) = 45.\n\nSo, the answer should be 45 handshakes in total.\n\nBut the way the question is worded, it seems like it's trying to break it down into steps: first, I shake hands with everyone, and then everyone else shakes hands with each other.\n\nBut in reality, if everyone is shaking hands with everyone else exactly once, it's all part of the same process, and the total is just 45 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the \"then each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once\" is referring to after I have already shaken hands with everyone.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the total would be my 9 handshakes plus the handshakes among the remaining 9 people.\n\nSo, C(9,2) = 36 handshakes among the other 9 people, plus my 9 handshakes, totaling 45, which again matches C(10,2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"then each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once\" includes the handshakes I did, making it 45 handshakes in total.\n\nI think the confusion arises from the phrasing of the question.\n\nAnother way to look at it: if I shake hands with everyone except myself, that's 9 handshakes. Then, each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, which includes those 9 handshakes I already did.\n\nSo, to avoid double-counting, the total should be C(10,2) = 45 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to say that I shake hands with everyone first, and then, in addition to that, each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\n\nBut that would lead to double-counting my handshakes.\n\nThat seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that, I believe the total number of handshakes is simply 45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 36, if we consider that my 9 handshakes are separate from the handshakes among the other 9 people.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the handshakes among the other 9 people would be C(9,2) = 36, plus my 9 handshakes, totaling 45, which again is C(10,2).\n\nI think the confusion comes from the phrasing of the question, making it seem like there are two separate steps, but in reality, it's all part of the same process.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
