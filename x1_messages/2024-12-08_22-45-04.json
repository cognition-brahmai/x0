        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three candidates in a school election: candidate A, B, and C. Candidate A received 60% of the votes, candidate B received 25%, and candidate C got the rest. We're told that candidate C received 450 votes, and we need to find out the total number of students who voted in the election.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the percentages work here. If candidate A has 60% and candidate B has 25%, together they account for 60% + 25% = 85% of the total votes. That means candidate C must have the remaining percentage of the votes. To find out what percentage candidate C received, I can subtract the combined percentage of A and B from 100%:\n\n100% - 85% = 15%\n\nSo, candidate C received 15% of the total votes.\n\nNow, we know that 15% of the total votes equals 450 votes. I need to find out what the total number of votes is. Let's denote the total number of votes as T.\n\nSo, 15% of T = 450\n\nIn mathematical terms, that's:\n\n0.15 * T = 450\n\nTo find T, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.15:\n\nT = 450 / 0.15\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n450 divided by 0.15.\n\nWell, dividing by a decimal can sometimes be tricky, so I can think of it as:\n\n450 divided by 15/100, because 0.15 is the same as 15/100.\n\nSo, T = 450 / (15/100) = 450 * (100/15)\n\nNow, 100 divided by 15 is approximately 6.666..., but let's keep it as a fraction for accuracy.\n\nSo, T = 450 * (100/15) = 450 * (20/3), because 100 divided by 15 is 20/3.\n\nNow, multiplying 450 by 20/3:\n\nFirst, 450 divided by 3 is 150.\n\nThen, 150 multiplied by 20 is 3000.\n\nSo, T = 3000\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who voted in the election is 3000.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's see if this makes sense.\n\nIf total votes are 3000, then:\n\n- Candidate A received 60% of 3000, which is 0.6 * 3000 = 1800 votes\n\n- Candidate B received 25% of 3000, which is 0.25 * 3000 = 750 votes\n\n- Candidate C received 15% of 3000, which is 0.15 * 3000 = 450 votes\n\nAdding those up: 1800 + 750 + 450 = 3000, which matches the total votes.\n\nSo, everything checks out. The answer is 3000 students voted in the election.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]"
