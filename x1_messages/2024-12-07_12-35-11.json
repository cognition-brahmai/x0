        "content": "Sure, I can help you design a Java-based chat server and client application using sockets. This setup will allow multiple clients to connect simultaneously, and the server will broadcast messages received from one client to all other connected clients. Additionally, the server will log all incoming messages along with timestamps and client IP addresses.\n\n### Overview\n\n- **Server:** \n  - Listens for incoming client connections.\n  - Manages multiple client connections using threads.\n  - Broadcasts messages from one client to all other connected clients.\n  - Logs all incoming messages with timestamps and client IP addresses.\n\n- **Client:**\n  - Connects to the server.\n  - Sends messages to the server.\n  - Receives messages from the server.\n\n### Technologies Used\n\n- Java Sockets for network communication.\n- Threads for handling multiple clients.\n- Logging mechanism to record messages with timestamps and IP addresses.\n\n### Server Implementation\n\n1. **Server Class:**\n   - Binds to a specific port and listens for incoming connections.\n   - Accepts multiple client connections and manages them using threads.\n\n2. **ClientHandler Class:**\n   - Handles communication with a single client.\n   - Reads messages from the client and broadcasts them to other clients.\n   - Logs messages with timestamps and client IP addresses.\n\n3. **Broadcast Mechanism:**\n   - Maintains a list of all connected clients.\n   - Sends messages to all clients except the sender.\n\n4. **Logging:**\n   - Uses Java's logging framework to log messages with timestamps and client IP addresses.\n\n### Client Implementation\n\n1. **Client Class:**\n   - Connects to the server via a specified IP address and port.\n   - Allows users to input messages which are sent to the server.\n   - Displays messages received from the server.\n\n### Code Structure\n\n- **Server:**\n  - `ChatServer.java`: Main server class.\n  - `ClientHandler.java`: Handles individual client connections.\n  - `Logger.java`: Logging utility.\n\n- **Client:**\n  - `ChatClient.java`: Main client class.\n\n### Example Code\n\n#### Server\n\n**ChatServer.java**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ChatServer {\n    private static final int PORT = 12345;\n    private static List<ClientHandler> clients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Chat Server started on port \" + PORT);\n\n        while (true) {\n            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n            ClientHandler clientHandler = new ClientHandler(socket);\n            clients.add(clientHandler);\n            new Thread(clientHandler).start();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void broadcastMessage(String message, ClientHandler sender) {\n        for (ClientHandler client : clients) {\n            if (client != sender) {\n                client.sendMessage(message);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void removeClient(ClientHandler client) {\n        clients.remove(client);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**ClientHandler.java**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.Date;\n\npublic class ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n    private Socket socket;\n    private BufferedReader in;\n    private PrintWriter out;\n\n    public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {\n        this.socket = socket;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        try {\n            in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n            out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n            String clientIP = socket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress();\n            String message;\n\n            while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                Date timestamp = new Date();\n                String logMessage = String.format(\"[%s] %s: %s\", timestamp, clientIP, message);\n                Logger.log(logMessage);\n                ChatServer.broadcastMessage(message, this);\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            try {\n                socket.close();\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n            ChatServer.removeClient(this);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void sendMessage(String message) {\n        out.println(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Logger.java**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.util.Date;\n\npublic class Logger {\n    private static final String LOG_FILE = \"chat.log\";\n\n    public static void log(String message) {\n        try (PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(LOG_FILE, true))) {\n            out.println(message);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Client\n\n**ChatClient.java**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class ChatClient {\n    private static final String SERVER_IP = \"localhost\";\n    private static final int PORT = 12345;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        Socket socket = new Socket(SERVER_IP, PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Connected to server \" + SERVER_IP + \":\" + PORT);\n\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n        Thread readThread = new Thread(() -> {\n            try {\n                String message;\n                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(message);\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        });\n        readThread.start();\n\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        while (true) {\n            String message = scanner.nextLine();\n            out.println(message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **ChatServer.java:** \n  - Listens for incoming connections on a specified port.\n  - Manages multiple client connections using `ClientHandler` threads.\n  - Broadcasts messages received from one client to all other connected clients.\n\n- **ClientHandler.java:**\n  - Handles communication with a single client.\n  - Reads messages from the client and broadcasts them to other clients.\n  - Logs messages with timestamps and client IP addresses using the `Logger` class.\n\n- **Logger.java:**\n  - Provides a simple logging mechanism to write messages to a log file with timestamps and client IP addresses.\n\n- **ChatClient.java:**\n  - Connects to the server via a specified IP address and port.\n  - Allows users to input messages which are sent to the server.\n  - Displays messages received from the server in real-time.\n\nThis setup ensures that multiple clients can connect to the server simultaneously, send messages to each other, and have their communications logged with relevant details."
