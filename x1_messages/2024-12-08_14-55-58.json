        "content": "Let's see. The car is going from Town A to Town B, which is 120 miles apart, and it's traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. It starts at 9 AM and takes a 30-minute break. I need to find out what time it will reach Town B.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how long the trip takes without the break. Distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, so time is distance divided by speed. So, time = 120 miles / 60 mph = 2 hours.\n\nBut there's a 30-minute break, so I need to add that to the total travel time. 2 hours plus 30 minutes equals 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nNow, if the car starts at 9 AM, I need to add 2 hours and 30 minutes to that start time to find out when it arrives.\n\n9 AM plus 2 hours is 11 AM, and then adding 30 minutes brings us to 11:30 AM.\n\nSo, the car should reach Town B at 11:30 AM.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that the break is taken during the trip, not at the end. Does it matter when the break is taken? If the break is taken during the journey, say after driving for some time, it shouldn't affect the total time calculation, as long as the driving time and the break time are both included in the total time.\n\nLet me confirm: the car drives for 2 hours and takes a 30-minute break, so the total time is 2 hours and 30 minutes, regardless of when the break is taken.\n\nTherefore, starting at 9 AM, plus 2 hours and 30 minutes, should be 11:30 AM.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11:30 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
