        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls are in the school.\n\nThe school has 500 students, and 60% of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:\n\nNumber of boys = 60% of 500 = 0.60 \u00d7 500 = 300 boys\n\nSince the total number of students is 500, the number of girls would be:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 500 - 300 = 200 girls\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of these boys and girls participate in the sports program.\n\n75% of the boys participate in the sports program. So, the number of boys participating is:\n\nNumber of boys participating = 75% of 300 = 0.75 \u00d7 300 = 225 boys\n\n80% of the girls participate in the sports program. So, the number of girls participating is:\n\nNumber of girls participating = 80% of 200 = 0.80 \u00d7 200 = 160 girls\n\nTo find the total number of students participating in the sports program, we add the number of boys and girls participating:\n\nTotal participating = Number of boys participating + Number of girls participating = 225 + 160 = 385 students\n\nSo, 385 students are participating in the sports program.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{385} \\]"
