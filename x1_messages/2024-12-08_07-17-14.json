        "content": "Let's see. So, in this city, 60% of the population are adults, and 40% are children, and the total population is 240,000 people. I need to find out how many adults and how many children there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many adults there are. Since adults make up 60% of the population, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 240,000.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 240,000, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 60% is the same as 0.60. So, I multiply 240,000 by 0.60.\n\n240,000 \u00d7 0.60 = ?\n\nWell, 240,000 times 0.60 is 144,000. So, there are 144,000 adults in the city.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many children there are. Since children make up 40% of the population, I can calculate that by taking 40% of 240,000.\n\nAgain, converting the percentage to a decimal, 40% is 0.40. So, I multiply 240,000 by 0.40.\n\n240,000 \u00d7 0.40 = ?\n\n240,000 times 0.40 is 96,000. So, there are 96,000 children in the city.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answers.\n\nAnother way could be to add the number of adults and children together and see if it equals the total population.\n\nSo, 144,000 adults plus 96,000 children equals 240,000 people, which matches the total population given. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that the percentages add up to 100%. Since adults are 60% and children are 40%, together that's 100%, which represents the entire population.\n\nSo, if I take 60% for adults and 40% for children of the total population of 240,000, I get the numbers I calculated earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population.\n\nSo, 240,000 total people minus 144,000 adults equals 96,000 children. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, I could calculate the number of adults by subtracting the number of children from the total population.\n\n240,000 minus 96,000 children equals 144,000 adults. Again, it matches.\n\nSo, I'm confident that my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, in this city, there are 144,000 adults and 96,000 children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144000 \\text{ adults and } 96000 \\text{ children}} \\]"
