        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 houses on one side and 30 on the other, making a total of 50 houses. Each house has a unique number from 1 to 50. I need to find the sum of all these house numbers.\n\nFirst, I recall that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula S = n(n + 1)/2. Since the houses are numbered from 1 to 50, I can use this formula to find the sum.\n\nSo, plugging in n = 50, the sum S = 50(50 + 1)/2 = 50*51/2.\n\nLet me calculate that: 50*51 = 2550, and 2550 divided by 2 is 1275.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the house numbers on both sides of the street is 1275.\n\nBut wait a minute, the question mentions that there are 20 houses on one side and 30 on the other, but it doesn't specify if the numbering is sequential or mixed between the two sides. However, since it says each house has a number from 1 to 50, and assuming that all numbers are used exactly once, the total sum should indeed be 1275, regardless of which side they are on.\n\nI think that's the answer: 1275.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1275} \\]"
