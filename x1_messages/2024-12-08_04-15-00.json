        "content": "I believe the item you're referring to is baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate. It's a versatile chemical compound with various uses in the kitchen and beyond. In baking, it acts as a leavening agent, helping dough and batter rise by producing carbon dioxide gas when it reacts with acids. For cleaning, its mild abrasive properties and ability to neutralize odors make it effective for scrubbing surfaces and freshening up refrigerators. Additionally, baking soda can be used to extinguish small fires by smothering the flames, as it releases carbon dioxide which deprives the fire of oxygen."
