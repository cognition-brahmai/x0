        "content": "Let's tackle this marble probability problem. So, I've got a bag with red, blue, and green marbles in the ratio of 3:2:1. I need to find the probability that if I draw one marble at random, it's not green. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means in this context. A ratio of 3:2:1 for red, blue, and green marbles means that for every 3 red marbles, there are 2 blue marbles and 1 green marble. So, the total number of parts is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 parts.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing either a red or a blue marble, since not green means either red or blue.\n\nSo, one way to think about it is to find the probability of drawing red or blue separately and then add them up.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a red marble. Since there are 3 red marbles out of a total of 6 marbles, the probability is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNext, the probability of drawing a blue marble. There are 2 blue marbles out of 6, so that's 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNow, if I add these probabilities together, 1/2 + 1/3, I need to find a common denominator. 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So, the probability of drawing either red or blue is 5/6.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of not drawing green directly. Since the only other options are red and blue, this should be the same as the above.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to subtract the probability of drawing green from 100%, because the probability of not green is 1 minus the probability of green.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nThe probability of drawing green is 1 out of 6, since there's 1 green marble in the 6 total parts. So, that's 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not green is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6.\n\nHmm, that matches what I got earlier by adding the probabilities of red and blue.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I think about actual numbers of marbles. Let's say there are 3 red, 2 blue, and 1 green marble, making a total of 6 marbles. The probability of not drawing green is the number of non-green marbles divided by the total number of marbles.\n\nNumber of non-green marbles is 3 red + 2 blue = 5 marbles.\n\nTotal marbles are 6.\n\nSo, probability is 5/6.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nWhat if I scale up the numbers? Let's say there are 6 red, 4 blue, and 2 green marbles. Total is 12 marbles.\n\nNumber of non-green marbles is 6 red + 4 blue = 10.\n\nProbability is 10/12 = 5/6.\n\nStill the same.\n\nOr, if I take 9 red, 6 blue, and 3 green marbles. Total is 18.\n\nNon-green is 9 + 6 = 15.\n\nProbability is 15/18 = 5/6.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, it seems no matter how many marbles I have, as long as the ratio is 3:2:1, the probability of drawing a non-green marble is 5/6.\n\nWait a minute, is there a way this could be wrong?\n\nI should consider if the marbles are drawn with replacement or not, but since it's a single draw, that shouldn't matter.\n\nAlso, assuming that each marble is equally likely to be drawn, which seems logical.\n\nIs there any scenario where this probability would be different?\n\nSuppose the bag doesn't contain only red, blue, and green marbles, but there are other colors as well. But the problem says it's only these three colors, so that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the ratio isn't exactly 3:2:1, but the problem states it is, so that's given.\n\nWait, maybe if there are no marbles at all, but that's not possible since the ratio implies there are marbles.\n\nOr if there is only one marble, but 3:2:1 ratio suggests at least 6 marbles.\n\nAssuming the ratio is exact, which it is.\n\nSo, I think 5/6 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more formal way to express this.\n\nUsing the formula for probability:\n\nP(not green) = P(red) + P(blue)\n\nGiven the ratio, P(red) = 3/6, P(blue) = 2/6, so P(not green) = 5/6.\n\nAlternatively, P(not green) = 1 - P(green) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6.\n\nBoth ways lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider?\n\nPerhaps using odds.\n\nThe odds against drawing a green marble are the number of non-green marbles to the number of green marbles, which is 5:1.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/(5+1) = 5/6.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed this from multiple perspectives.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a marble that is not green is 5/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{6}} \\]"
