        "content": "In communication systems, the primary function of a modulator is to change the form of a signal to make it suitable for transmission. So, the correct answer is D. It changes the form of a signal to make it suitable for transmission.\n\nTo elaborate, modulation is a process where some characteristics of a carrier wave, such as its amplitude, frequency, or phase, are varied in accordance with the information being transmitted. This modulated signal can then be efficiently transmitted over long distances via various mediums like air, cables, or optical fibers.\n\nOption A suggests that a modulator converts digital signals into analog signals, which is partially correct but not comprehensive. Modulators can indeed convert digital signals into analog for transmission, such as in digital-to-analog conversion in digital communication systems. However, modulation also includes analog-to-analog conversion, like amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) used in radio broadcasting.\n\nOption B, converting analog signals into digital signals, is actually the function of a demodulator or a decoder in digital communication systems. This process is known as demodulation or detection.\n\nOption C, amplifying the strength of signals, is performed by amplifiers in the communication system, not modulators. While modulators do alter the signal for transmission, their primary function isn't amplification.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and comprehensive answer is D, as it covers the general role of a modulator in preparing signals for transmission, regardless of whether the signals are analog or digital.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Modulation:** The process of modifying a carrier wave to encode information for transmission.\n\n- **Types of Modulation:**\n\n  - **Amplitude Modulation (AM):** Varies the amplitude of the carrier wave in proportion to the information signal.\n\n  - **Frequency Modulation (FM):** Varies the frequency of the carrier wave based on the information signal.\n\n  - **Phase Modulation (PM):** Changes the phase of the carrier wave in accordance with the information signal.\n\n- **Digital Modulation:** Techniques like Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), Phase Shift Keying (PSK), and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) are used to transmit digital data.\n\n- **Purpose:** To make the signal suitable for transmission over a particular medium, to avoid interference, and to allow multiple signals to share the same channel through techniques like multiplexing.\n\nUnderstanding modulation is fundamental in communication systems as it directly impacts the quality, efficiency, and reliability of signal transmission."
