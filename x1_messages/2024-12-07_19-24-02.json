So, the number of fruits he has now is 3 apples + 4 oranges = 7 fruits. \n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. He took out 3 apples from 5, which leaves 2 apples in the basket, and 4 oranges from 7, leaving 3 oranges in the basket. So, the basket now has 2 apples + 3 oranges = 5 fruits remaining. Since there were originally 12 fruits and he took out some, having 5 left means he took out 12 - 5 = 7 fruits, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as John taking out 3 apples and 4 oranges, so the total fruits he took out is indeed 3 + 4 = 7 fruits.\n\nSo, the answer is he has 7 fruits now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
