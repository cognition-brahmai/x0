        "content": "The musical instrument you're referring to is the bagpipes. It's indeed strongly associated with Scotland, although similar instruments are found in other cultures around the world. The bagpipes consist of a bag that holds air, which is then blown into by the player or sometimes supplied by a bellows. The chanter is the part that plays the melody, and it's attached to the bag. Drones are tubes with reeds that produce a constant pitch, typically played alongside the melody to provide a harmonic foundation. In Scottish bagpipes, there are usually at least one or two drones, but sometimes more, each producing a different pitch, such as bass, tenor, or treble drones. The sound of the bagpipes is instantly recognizable and is often featured in ceremonial events, parades, and traditional Scottish music."
