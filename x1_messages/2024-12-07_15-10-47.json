        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a room filled with people, half of them are wearing glasses, one-third are wearing hats, and one-sixth are wearing both glasses and hats. I need to find out what fraction of the people in the room are wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. I need to find the fraction of people who are wearing either glasses or hats, which means people who are wearing glasses only, hats only, or both.\n\nI remember that in set theory, the principle of inclusion-exclusion can be used to find the union of two sets. The formula for the union of two sets A and B is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nIn this context:\n\n- Set A is the set of people wearing glasses.\n\n- Set B is the set of people wearing hats.\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the set of people wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nSo, applying this to the problem:\n\n- |A| = half of the people = 1/2\n\n- |B| = one-third of the people = 1/3\n\n- |A \u2229 B| = one-sixth of the people = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the fraction of people wearing either glasses or hats is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B| = 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6\n\nNow, I need to calculate that. First, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 2, 3, and 6 is 6.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n- 1/2 = 3/6\n\n- 1/3 = 2/6\n\n- 1/6 remains 1/6\n\nSo,\n\n|A \u222a B| = 3/6 + 2/6 - 1/6 = (3 + 2 - 1)/6 = 4/6\n\nSimplify 4/6 to 2/3.\n\nTherefore, two-thirds of the people in the room are wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the total fraction of people wearing glasses, hats, and both, and see how they overlap.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Half wearing glasses: 1/2\n\n- One-third wearing hats: 1/3\n\n- One-sixth wearing both: 1/6\n\nIf I add the glasses and hats, that's 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6. But this counts the people wearing both glasses and hats twice, once in each category. So, to get the total number of people wearing either glasses or hats, I need to subtract the overlap, which is the people wearing both.\n\nSo, total wearing either glasses or hats = 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6 = 5/6 - 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of Venn diagrams. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents people wearing glasses, and the other represents people wearing hats.\n\n- The glasses circle has 1/2 of the people.\n\n- The hats circle has 1/3 of the people.\n\n- The overlapping area, wearing both, is 1/6.\n\nSo, the part wearing only glasses is 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3.\n\nThe part wearing only hats is 1/3 - 1/6 = 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the total wearing either glasses or hats is the sum of only glasses, only hats, and both:\n\n1/3 (only glasses) + 1/6 (only hats) + 1/6 (both) = 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 + 2/6 = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nAgain, that confirms the answer is 2/3.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there a possibility that some people aren't wearing either glasses or hats? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that's possible, and the fraction wearing either glasses or hats is just the sum minus the overlap, as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire room as 1, and subtract the fraction wearing neither, but I don't know the fraction wearing neither, so it's probably not helpful here.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use probabilities, assuming each person's choice to wear glasses or hats is independent, but the problem doesn't provide information about independence, so I should stick with the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the fraction of people wearing either glasses or hats is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
