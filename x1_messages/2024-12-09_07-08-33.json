        "content": "Let's see. The train goes from Town A to Town B, which is 180 miles apart, and it travels at 60 miles per hour. There's a stop for 15 minutes halfway through the journey. I need to find out the total time for the entire trip.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how long it takes to travel 180 miles at 60 miles per hour. I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time = 180 miles / 60 mph. That should be 3 hours.\n\nBut wait, there's a stop halfway through the journey. Halfway would be at 90 miles, right? Since the total distance is 180 miles.\n\nSo, the train travels 90 miles to the station, stops for 15 minutes, and then travels another 90 miles to Town B.\n\nLet me calculate the time for each segment.\n\nTime to travel the first 90 miles: 90 miles / 60 mph = 1.5 hours.\n\nStop time: 15 minutes. I need to convert that to hours because the speed is in miles per hour. 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.\n\nTime to travel the next 90 miles: again, 90 miles / 60 mph = 1.5 hours.\n\nNow, total time is the sum of these: 1.5 hours + 0.25 hours + 1.5 hours.\n\nLet me add those up: 1.5 + 0.25 = 1.75 hours, and then 1.75 + 1.5 = 3.25 hours.\n\nSo, the entire trip takes 3.25 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to look at it. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total time as the sum of traveling time and stop time.\n\nTraveling time is 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours.\n\nPlus stop time of 15 minutes (0.25 hours).\n\nSo, total time is 3 hours + 0.25 hours = 3.25 hours.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.25 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
