        "content": "So in this problem, we have a class of 40 students. According to the information given, 60% of them play soccer, 30% play basketball, and the rest don't participate in any sports. We need to find out how many students don't participate in any sports.\n\nFirst, let's understand what percentages represent here. Percentages are fractions of 100, so 60% means 60 out of 100, and 30% means 30 out of 100. But since we have only 40 students, we need to find what 60% and 30% of 40 are.\n\nTo find 60% of 40, we can calculate it as follows:\n60% of 40 = (60/100) * 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 students\n\nSimilarly, for 30% of 40:\n30% of 40 = (30/100) * 40 = 0.3 * 40 = 12 students\n\nSo, 24 students play soccer and 12 students play basketball.\n\nNow, to find out how many students do not participate in any sports, we can subtract the number of students who play soccer and basketball from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students = 40\nStudents playing soccer = 24\nStudents playing basketball = 12\n\nStudents not participating in any sports = Total students - (Students playing soccer + Students playing basketball)\n\n= 40 - (24 + 12) = 40 - 36 = 4 students\n\nTherefore, 4 students do not participate in any sports.\n\nAlternatively, we could have calculated the percentage of students who do not participate in any sports. Since 60% play soccer and 30% play basketball, that adds up to 90% (60% + 30% = 90%). So, the remaining 10% do not participate in any sports.\n\nTo find 10% of 40:\n10% of 40 = (10/100) * 40 = 0.1 * 40 = 4 students\n\nAgain, we get the same answer: 4 students do not participate in any sports.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion, which is a good way to verify our answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
