        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular garden that's currently 15 meters long and 8 meters wide. The gardener wants to increase the area by 50% by adding the same amount of width to both sides of the garden. We need to figure out how much wider the garden should be.\n\nFirst, let's find the current area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Area} = 15 \\, \\text{m} \\times 8 \\, \\text{m} = 120 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nThe gardener wants to increase this area by 50%. So, the new area should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = 120 \\, \\text{m}^2 + 0.5 \\times 120 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 120 \\, \\text{m}^2 + 60 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 180 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, the gardener is going to add an equal amount of width to each side of the garden. Let's call this amount \\(x\\) meters. So, the new width will be the original width plus twice this amount (since we're adding \\(x\\) to both sides):\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Width} = 8 \\, \\text{m} + 2x\n\\]\n\nThe length remains the same at 15 meters. So, the new area will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = 15 \\, \\text{m} \\times (8 \\, \\text{m} + 2x) = 180 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, we can set up an equation and solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n15 \\times (8 + 2x) = 180\n\\]\n\nLet's expand the left side:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 8 + 15 \\times 2x = 180 \\\\\n120 + 30x = 180\n\\]\n\nSubtract 120 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n30x = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 30:\n\n\\[\nx = 2 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the gardener needs to add 2 meters to each side of the garden. But wait, the question asks how much wider the garden should be overall, not just how much is added to each side. Since we're adding \\(x\\) meters to both sides, the total increase in width is \\(2x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total increase in width} = 2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{m} = 4 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If we add 2 meters to each side, the new width is:\n\n\\[\n8 \\, \\text{m} + 4 \\, \\text{m} = 12 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThen, the new area is:\n\n\\[\n15 \\, \\text{m} \\times 12 \\, \\text{m} = 180 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches the desired new area. So, the garden should be 4 meters wider in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
