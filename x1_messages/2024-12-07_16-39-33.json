In the early 20th century, she rebelled against the rigid techniques of classical ballet and created a new style of dance that emphasized natural movements, freedom, and expressiveness. Her approach to dance was influenced by ancient Greek art, nature, and the rhythms of the body. Duncan's innovative techniques and philosophy had a profound impact on the development of modern dance as an art form."
