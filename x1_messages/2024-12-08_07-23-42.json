        "content": "Let's see. So, the factory produces 1200 units per day, and the production rate increases by 5% each week. We need to find out how many units will be produced on the 8th day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The production rate increases weekly, so for the first week, which is days 1 to 7, the production rate is 1200 units per day. Then, on the second week, which is days 8 to 14, the production rate increases by 5%.\n\nSo, to find the production on the 8th day, which is the first day of the second week, I need to calculate the new production rate after the 5% increase.\n\nLet me calculate the increased production rate.\n\nOriginal daily production: 1200 units\n\nWeekly increase: 5%\n\nSo, the new daily production rate after one week is:\n\n1200 units + (5% of 1200 units) = 1200 + (0.05 * 1200) = 1200 + 60 = 1260 units per day.\n\nTherefore, on the 8th day, which is the first day of the second week, the production rate is 1260 units per day.\n\nWait a minute, is this correct? Let me double-check.\n\nThe production rate increases by 5% each week, meaning that every week, the daily production rate is increased by 5% from the previous week's rate.\n\nSo, for week 1 (days 1-7): 1200 units/day\n\nFor week 2 (days 8-14): 1200 + 0.05*1200 = 1260 units/day\n\nFor week 3 (days 15-21): 1260 + 0.05*1260 = 1323 units/day\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut since we only need the production on the 8th day, which is in week 2, the production rate is 1260 units per day.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of exponential growth.\n\nThe production rate increases by 5% each week, so the multiplication factor is 1 + 0.05 = 1.05.\n\nSo, after n weeks, the daily production rate is:\n\nInitial rate * (1.05)^n\n\nIn this case, on the 8th day, it's the start of the second week, so n = 1 (since the first week is weeks 0 to 1).\n\nWait, actually, the first week is week 1, and the second week is week 2.\n\nWait, let's clarify this.\n\nIf day 1 to day 7 is week 1, day 8 to day 14 is week 2, and so on.\n\nSo, on day 8, it's the first day of week 2.\n\nTherefore, the production rate for week 2 is the initial rate increased by 5%.\n\nSo, production rate for week 2 = 1200 * 1.05 = 1260 units/day.\n\nTherefore, on day 8, the production is 1260 units.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider week 0 as before any increase, then week 1 would be the first increase, but in this problem, the production increases by 5% each week starting from the first week.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says \"each week,\" meaning every seven days, the production rate increases by 5%.\n\nSo, for day 1 to day 7: 1200 units/day\n\nThen, for day 8 to day 14: 1200 * 1.05 = 1260 units/day\n\nThen, for day 15 to day 21: 1260 * 1.05 = 1323 units/day\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTherefore, on day 8, the production is 1260 units.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the timing of the increase.\n\nDoes the 5% increase happen at the start of each week, or at the end of each week?\n\nThe problem says \"increases by 5% each week,\" but it doesn't specify when exactly the increase occurs.\n\nFor simplicity, I think it's reasonable to assume that the increase happens at the start of each week.\n\nSo, at the start of week 2 (day 8), the production rate increases by 5% from the previous week.\n\nTherefore, production on day 8 is 1200 * 1.05 = 1260 units.\n\nAlternatively, if the increase happens at the end of the week, then the production rate would increase after day 7, meaning that day 8 would still be at the original rate of 1200 units.\n\nBut the problem says \"each week,\" which might imply that the increase is applied at the start of each week.\n\nMoreover, since the increase is per week, and day 8 is the start of the second week, it's logical to apply the increase at that point.\n\nTherefore, the production on day 8 is 1260 units.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1260} \\]"
