        "content": "Certainly! There are several types of caves found around the world, each formed through different geological processes. Here are five main types:\n\n1. **Solution Caves**: These are the most common type of cave and are formed in limestone and other soluble rocks by the action of water containing dissolved carbon dioxide, which creates a weak acid capable of dissolving the rock. Over time, this leads to the formation of caves, often with distinctive features like stalactites and stalagmites. Examples include Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, USA, and Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, USA.\n\n2. **Lava Tubes**: Formed during volcanic eruptions when lava flows downhill and the outer layer cools and solidifies while the inner lava continues to flow, eventually draining away and leaving behind a hollow tube. These caves can be found in areas with volcanic activity, such as Hawaii and Iceland. Lava tubes often have unique formations like lava shelves and lavafalls.\n\n3. **Sea Caves**: Carved out by the constant action of waves eroding cliffs made of soft rock, such as sandstone or limestone. As waves crash against the cliff face, they wear away the rock, creating caves that can extend deep into the cliff. Famous sea caves include Fingal's Cave in Scotland and Neptune's Cave in Croatia.\n\n4. **Glacier Caves**: Found within glaciers and icefields, these caves are formed by meltwater flowing through and under the ice. The water erodes the ice, creating passageways and chambers. Glacier caves can be dangerous due to the instability of the ice and the risk of collapse. They are found in regions with extensive glaciation, such as Alaska and Patagonia.\n\n5. **Talus Caves**: These caves are formed in piles of rock, known as talus slopes, which accumulate at the base of cliffs or mountains. Over time, these rock piles can become stable enough to form cavities and passages. Talus caves are often small and can be found in various mountainous regions around the world.\n\nEach type of cave offers unique insights into geological processes and often harbors specialized ecosystems adapted to life in darkness."
