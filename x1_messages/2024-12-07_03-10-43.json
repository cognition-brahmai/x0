        "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Avengers and beyond,\n\nI'm standing here today, not just as Tony Stark, but as someone who's been part of something extraordinary. Something that started with a group of misfits and evolved into the Earth's mightiest heroes. The Avengers.\n\nFirst off, let me say this: it's been one hell of a ride. From that first assembly in New York, where we barely managed to save the world from total annihilation, to the countless missions, the victories, and the losses that have shaped us into who we are today. Each of you has played a crucial role in making this team what it is.\n\nBut today isn't about looking back; it's about looking forward. And for me, that means something difficult. Something I never thought I'd have to say.\n\nI'm retiring from the Avengers.\n\nYeah, you heard me right. Iron Man is hanging up his suit, at least for now. Now, before you all start questioning my sanity or my loyalty, let me explain.\n\nOver the years, I've pushed myself to the limit, both physically and mentally. Suit upgrades, global crises, saving the world\u2014again and again. It's taken a toll on me. My body, my mind, even my relationships have suffered because of the weight of responsibility I've carried.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love being Iron Man. It's been a part of me for so long that it's hard to imagine life without it. But lately, I've been asking myself, what's the point of having all this technology, all this power, if I can't use it to make a real difference in people's lives beyond just fighting battles?\n\nI've built suits for others, empowered nations, but maybe it's time for me to step back and focus on using my intellect and resources to create lasting peace, to innovate in ways that don't involve blowing things up.\n\nAlso, there's something else. Age is catching up with me, whether I like it or not. The suits have kept me going, but even they can't compensate forever for the wear and tear of time. I need to prioritize my health, my family, my friends.\n\nDoes that mean I'm abandoning you? Not at all. The Avengers will always have my support, my resources, my advice\u2014whatever you need. But I can't be the one running into danger anymore. It's time for a new generation to take the lead.\n\nI have faith in each and every one of you. From Cap to Thor, Black Widow to Hawkeye, and all the new faces who've joined over the years. You're stronger, smarter, and more resilient than ever. The world is in good hands.\n\nSo, to my fellow Avengers: keep fighting the good fight. Protect this planet, protect each other. Because that's what we do.\n\nTo those who may question my decision: understand that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is know when it's time to step aside and let others carry the torch.\n\nAnd to myself: well, it's time to find out what comes next. Time to explore new horizons, to create, to maybe just live a little.\n\nThank you all for being part of this incredible journey. Here's to many more adventures, and to a brighter future.\n\nStark out.\n\n(With a smile and a nod, Tony turns to walk away, leaving the Avengers to process his words and prepare for a new chapter without their iconic leader.)"
