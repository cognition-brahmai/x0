        "content": "So the store has these bags that hold 5 apples each, and they've got 200 apples in total. The question is, how many full bags can they make from those 200 apples?\n\nWell, to find out how many full bags they can make, I think I need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag. So, that would be 200 apples divided by 5 apples per bag.\n\nLet me do the math: 200 divided by 5 is 40. So, they can make 40 full bags.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check that. If each bag has 5 apples, and they have 40 bags, that would be 5 times 40, which is 200 apples. Yeah, that matches the total they have in stock.\n\nSo, the answer should be 40 full bags.\n\nHmm, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe if some apples are defective or something, but the question doesn't mention anything like that. It says they have 200 apples in stock, and they sell them in bags of 5 each.\n\nSo, no, I think 40 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any apples left over after making the full bags. Since 200 is perfectly divisible by 5, there shouldn't be any leftovers.\n\nYes, 200 divided by 5 is exactly 40, with no remainder.\n\nTherefore, they can make 40 full bags of apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
