Before the construction of the Panama Canal, this narrow strip of land was the only land connection between the two continents. The isthmus played a crucial role in the Great American Interchange, where many species of plants and animals migrated between North and South America. The city of Panama, located on this isthmus, is the capital and largest city of Panama, serving as a major hub for international trade and commerce due to its strategic location."
