        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many widgets the factory produces in one hour, then in a day, then in a week, and finally in a month. After that, we'll calculate the revenue based on the selling price per widget.\n\nSo, the factory produces 500 widgets per hour. It runs for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. And we need to find out the monthly production assuming there are 4 weeks in a month. Each widget sells for $10, so we'll multiply the total number of widgets produced in a month by $10 to get the revenue.\n\nLet me start by calculating the daily production:\n\nWidgets per hour: 500\n\nHours per day: 8\n\nSo, daily production = 500 widgets/hour * 8 hours/day = 4,000 widgets/day\n\nNext, weekly production:\n\nDaily production: 4,000 widgets/day\n\nDays per week: 5\n\nWeekly production = 4,000 widgets/day * 5 days/week = 20,000 widgets/week\n\nNow, monthly production:\n\nWeekly production: 20,000 widgets/week\n\nWeeks per month: 4\n\nMonthly production = 20,000 widgets/week * 4 weeks/month = 80,000 widgets/month\n\nFinally, revenue:\n\nEach widget sells for $10\n\nSo, monthly revenue = 80,000 widgets/month * $10/widget = $800,000/month\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider if there are any other factors, like production downtime or holidays, but according to the problem, the production line runs consistently for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks a month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it differently to confirm.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of hours the production line runs in a month:\n\nHours per day: 8\n\nDays per week: 5\n\nWeeks per month: 4\n\nTotal hours per month = 8 * 5 * 4 = 160 hours\n\nNow, production rate is 500 widgets per hour, so total monthly production should be:\n\n500 widgets/hour * 160 hours/month = 80,000 widgets/month\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, revenue is price per widget times number of widgets sold.\n\nAssuming all produced widgets are sold, which the problem implies, revenue would be:\n\n80,000 widgets * $10/widget = $800,000\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the factory sells all the widgets it produces. The problem says \"each widget sells for $10,\" so it seems like they sell all of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are some widgets that are defective or unsold, but the problem doesn't mention any such issues, so I think it's safe to assume all produced widgets are sold.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the revenue per day or per week and then scale it up to a month, but that should give the same result.\n\nFor example, daily revenue:\n\n4,000 widgets/day * $10/widget = $40,000/day\n\nWeekly revenue:\n\n$40,000/day * 5 days/week = $200,000/week\n\nMonthly revenue:\n\n$200,000/week * 4 weeks/month = $800,000/month\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider a month to have approximately 4.33 weeks (since there are 52 weeks in a year and 12 months), but the problem specifies to assume 4 weeks per month, so we'll stick with that.\n\nTherefore, the factory generates $800,000 in revenue per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800000} \\]"
