        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, and I need to find both the perimeter and the area of the garden. Okay, let's start with the perimeter.\n\nI remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is the total distance around the outside. For a rectangle, that means adding up all four sides. Since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, I can say that the two lengths are both 20 feet, and the two widths are both 15 feet. So, the perimeter should be 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 length + 2 \u00d7 width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 20 + 2 \u00d7 15\n\nNow, calculating that:\n\n2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n\n2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n\nSo, Perimeter = 40 + 30 = 70 feet\n\nAlright, that seems straightforward. Now, for the area.\n\nI know that the area of a rectangle is the amount of space inside the rectangle. The formula for area is length times width.\n\nSo, Area = length \u00d7 width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nArea = 20 \u00d7 15\n\nCalculating that:\n\n20 \u00d7 15 = 300 square feet\n\nOkay, so the perimeter is 70 feet and the area is 300 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that I'm using the correct units. Perimeter is a length, so it's in feet, and area is in square feet. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't miss anything in the problem. It seems straightforward, but it's always good to verify.\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\nPerimeter: 70 feet\n\nArea: 300 square feet\n\nI think that's correct. If there's anything else I need to consider, I'll think about it again.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider if there are any other formulas or ways to calculate this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, for the perimeter, there's another formula: Perimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nLet me try that:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (20 + 15) = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70 feet\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nFor the area, it's definitely length times width, no other way to calculate it for a rectangle.\n\nSo, I'm confident with these answers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Perimeter: } 70 \\text{ feet}, \\text{ Area: } 300 \\text{ square feet}} \\]"
