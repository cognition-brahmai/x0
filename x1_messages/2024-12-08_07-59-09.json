This is mentioned in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" when Hagrid says, \"There's not a potion in the world that can bring back the dead, Harry. Don't ever forget that.\" However, unicorn blood is often misinterpreted as a means to cheat death, but it's important to note that it doesn't actually bring the dead back to life; it merely sustains a dying person, but at a great cost."
