        "content": "Let's see. So, there are three friends who decide to share a pizza equally. But one of them arrives late, and by the time he gets there, the other two have already eaten half of the pizza. Now, the question is, how much of the pizza should each person get now?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. There are three friends, let's call them A, B, and C. A and B are there on time, and they start eating the pizza before C arrives. They eat half of the pizza together before C comes. So, when C arrives, there's only half of the pizza left.\n\nNow, the question is, how should they divide the remaining pizza so that overall, each person gets an equal share.\n\nWait a minute. They initially decided to share the pizza equally, which means each should get one-third of the pizza. But A and B have already eaten half of it before C arrived.\n\nSo, let's calculate how much A and B have already eaten.\n\nThe whole pizza is considered as 1.\n\nA and B together ate half of it, so they ate 1/2 of the pizza.\n\nNow, since there are two of them, if they ate equally, each ate 1/4 of the pizza.\n\nBecause 1/2 divided by 2 is 1/4.\n\nSo, A ate 1/4, B ate 1/4, and C ate 0 so far.\n\nNow, when C arrives, there's 1/2 of the pizza left.\n\nThey want to share this remaining half equally among the three of them.\n\nSo, each should get an equal share of this remaining half.\n\nTherefore, each should get (1/2) divided by 3, which is 1/6 of the pizza.\n\nBut wait, they want to share the whole pizza equally, not just the remaining half.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nEach should get one-third of the pizza in total.\n\nA and B have already eaten 1/4 each, which is more than their share.\n\nBecause one-third is 1/3, which is approximately 0.333, and 1/4 is 0.25.\n\nWait, but 1/3 is actually larger than 1/4.\n\nWait, no, 1/3 is approximately 0.333, and 1/4 is 0.25, so 1/3 is larger than 1/4.\n\nSo, each should get 1/3, but A and B have already eaten 1/4 each, which is less than their share.\n\nWait, but 1/4 is less than 1/3.\n\nYes, because 1/3 is more than 1/4.\n\nSo, A and B have each eaten 1/4, which is less than their one-third share.\n\nWait, but 1/3 is more than 1/4.\n\nSo, each should get 1/3 in total.\n\nA has eaten 1/4, so A needs to eat an additional 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12 of the pizza.\n\nSimilarly, B has eaten 1/4, so B also needs to eat an additional 1/12 of the pizza.\n\nC has eaten nothing so far, so C needs to eat 1/3 of the pizza.\n\nNow, the remaining pizza is 1/2.\n\nSo, the question is, how much should each eat now, considering what they've already eaten.\n\nSo, A needs to eat 1/12 more, B needs to eat 1/12 more, and C needs to eat 1/3.\n\nTotal remaining is 1/2.\n\nLet's check if 1/12 + 1/12 + 1/3 equals 1/2.\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. 12 is a common denominator.\n\n1/12 is 1/12.\n\n1/12 is 1/12.\n\n1/3 is 4/12.\n\nSo, 1/12 + 1/12 + 4/12 = 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nYes, that matches the remaining pizza.\n\nSo, A should eat an additional 1/12, B should eat an additional 1/12, and C should eat 4/12, which is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, in total, each will have eaten:\n\nA: 1/4 + 1/12 = 3/12 + 1/12 = 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nB: 1/4 + 1/12 = 3/12 + 1/12 = 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nC: 0 + 4/12 = 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nPerfect, it balances out.\n\nSo, to answer the question, each person should get 1/3 of the pizza in total, considering what they've already eaten.\n\nBut specifically, now, A and B should each eat an additional 1/12, and C should eat 1/3.\n\nBut the question might be asking how much each should get of the remaining half.\n\nSo, A and B have already eaten 1/4 each, which is more than their 1/3 share.\n\nWait, no, earlier calculation shows 1/4 is less than 1/3.\n\nWait, 1/4 is 0.25, and 1/3 is approximately 0.333, so 1/4 is less than 1/3.\n\nTherefore, A and B have eaten less than their share, not more.\n\nSo, they need to eat more to reach their one-third share.\n\nWhile C has eaten nothing, so he needs to eat his full one-third share.\n\nNow, the remaining pizza is 1/2.\n\nSo, A needs to eat 1/12 more, B needs to eat 1/12 more, and C needs to eat 1/3.\n\nWhich adds up to 1/2.\n\nSo, in terms of the remaining pizza, A should get 1/12, B should get 1/12, and C should get 1/3.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, since the remaining pizza is 1/2, and they need to share it in such a way that everyone ends up with 1/3 each.\n\nSo, let's set up equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet x be the amount A and B will eat from the remaining half.\n\nAnd y be the amount C will eat from the remaining half.\n\nBut we know that A and B have already eaten 1/4 each.\n\nSo, A's total will be 1/4 + x, and B's total will be 1/4 + x.\n\nC's total will be y.\n\nAnd all of them should have 1/3 each.\n\nSo:\n\n1/4 + x = 1/3 for A.\n\nSimilarly for B: 1/4 + x = 1/3.\n\nAnd for C: y = 1/3.\n\nAlso, the remaining pizza is 1/2, so:\n\n2x + y = 1/2.\n\nBecause A and B both eat x each, and C eats y.\n\nFrom A's equation: x = 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12.\n\nSimilarly for B: x = 1/12.\n\nAnd for C: y = 1/3.\n\nNow, check if 2x + y = 2*(1/12) + 1/3 = 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nYes, it matches.\n\nSo, A and B should each eat an additional 1/12 of the pizza, and C should eat 1/3 of the pizza.\n\nTherefore, in terms of the remaining half, A gets 1/12, B gets 1/12, and C gets 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, since the remaining pizza is 1/2, and they need to divide it into portions of 1/12, 1/12, and 1/3.\n\nTo make it clearer, perhaps we can think in terms of fractions of the remaining half.\n\nSo, the remaining pizza is 1/2.\n\nA should get 1/12 out of the remaining 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, B should get 1/12, and C should get 1/3.\n\nBut let's see what 1/12 is in terms of the remaining half.\n\nThe remaining half is 1/2.\n\nSo, 1/12 divided by 1/2 is (1/12)/(1/2) = (1/12)*(2/1) = 1/6.\n\nSo, A should get 1/6 of the remaining half.\n\nSimilarly, B should get 1/6 of the remaining half.\n\nAnd C should get how much?\n\n1/3 divided by 1/2 is (1/3)/(1/2) = 2/3.\n\nSo, C should get 2/3 of the remaining half.\n\nNow, check if 1/6 + 1/6 + 2/3 = 1.\n\n1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\n1/3 + 2/3 = 1.\n\nYes, it adds up.\n\nSo, in terms of the remaining half, A and B each get 1/6 of it, and C gets 2/3 of it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that A and B should each get 1/6 of the remaining pizza, and C should get 2/3 of the remaining pizza.\n\nBut the question might be expecting the final share each should get, considering the entire pizza.\n\nIn that case, each should get 1/3 of the entire pizza.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking how much of the remaining half each should get.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking what portion of the remaining pizza each should get.\n\nGiven that, A and B have already eaten 1/4 each of the whole pizza, so they should get less of the remaining pizza since they've already eaten more.\n\nWait, no, earlier calculation shows they've eaten less than their share.\n\nWait, earlier I thought A and B have eaten 1/4 each, which is less than their 1/3 share.\n\nBut let's double-check that.\n\n1/3 is approximately 0.333, and 1/4 is 0.25, so indeed, 0.25 < 0.333.\n\nSo, A and B have eaten less than their share.\n\nTherefore, they need to eat more of the remaining pizza to reach their one-third share.\n\nWhile C, who hasn't eaten anything, should eat his full one-third share of the pizza.\n\nSo, in terms of the remaining half, A and B each need to eat 1/12 more to reach their 1/3 share.\n\nAnd C needs to eat 1/3.\n\nAs we calculated earlier, this translates to A and B each getting 1/6 of the remaining half, and C getting 2/3 of the remaining half.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in terms of the entire pizza.\n\nEach should get 1/3 of the entire pizza.\n\nA has already eaten 1/4, so needs to eat 1/12 more.\n\nSimilarly for B.\n\nC has eaten nothing, so needs to eat 1/3.\n\nSo, in terms of the remaining pizza, which is 1/2, A should get 1/12, B should get 1/12, and C should get 1/3.\n\nBut 1/12 + 1/12 + 1/3 = 1/2, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of it as A and B have already eaten beyond their share.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations show they haven't.\n\nWait, no, wait a second.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused something.\n\nLet me recast the problem.\n\nThere are three friends: A, B, and C.\n\nThey decide to share a pizza equally, so each should get 1/3 of the pizza.\n\nA and B arrive on time and eat half of the pizza before C arrives.\n\nSo, A and B together eat 1/2 of the pizza.\n\nNow, the question is, how much should each get now, considering C arrives late.\n\nSo, A and B have already eaten 1/2 of the pizza.\n\nNow, C arrives, and they have to share the remaining 1/2.\n\nBut the problem says that A and B eat half of the pizza before C arrives.\n\nSo, A and B together eat 1/2.\n\nNow, if A and B eat 1/2 together, and there are two of them, if they eat equally, each eats 1/4.\n\nSo, A has eaten 1/4, B has eaten 1/4, and C has eaten 0.\n\nTotal eaten so far is 1/2.\n\nRemaining is 1/2.\n\nNow, they need to share the remaining 1/2 such that, in total, each gets 1/3.\n\nBut wait, A has already eaten 1/4, which is more than 1/3.\n\nWait, no, 1/4 is less than 1/3.\n\nBecause 1/3 is approximately 0.333, and 1/4 is 0.25.\n\nSo, A has eaten 0.25, and should have 0.333, so A needs to eat an additional 0.083 (1/12).\n\nSimilarly for B.\n\nC has eaten 0, so needs to eat 1/3.\n\nSo, the remaining 1/2 should be divided such that A and B each get 1/12 more, and C gets 1/3.\n\nAs we calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of it as A and B have already eaten more than their share.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, they haven't.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"Three friends decide to share a pizza equally. However, one friend arrives late, so the other two eat half of the pizza before he gets there. How much of the pizza should each person get now?\"\n\nSo, A and B eat half of the pizza before C arrives.\n\nNow, the question is, how much should each get now.\n\nI think the interpretation is that A and B have already eaten half, and now, with C arrived, they need to share the remaining half.\n\nBut the question is, how much should each get now, considering the initial agreement to share equally.\n\nSo, overall, each should get 1/3.\n\nBut A and B have already eaten 1/2 together, which is more than their combined share.\n\nWait, no, their combined share is 2/3.\n\nBecause each should get 1/3, so two of them should get 2/3 together.\n\nBut they have eaten 1/2.\n\nNow, 1/2 is less than 2/3.\n\nBecause 2/3 is approximately 0.666, and 1/2 is 0.5.\n\nSo, A and B together have eaten 0.5, but their combined share is 0.666.\n\nSo, they have eaten less than their combined share.\n\nWait, but if each should get 1/3, and there are three people, total is 1.\n\nBut A and B together have eaten 1/2, which is more than their combined share of 2/3.\n\nWait, no, 2/3 is approximately 0.666, and 1/2 is 0.5.\n\nSo, 0.5 < 0.666.\n\nWait, no, 0.5 is less than 0.666.\n\nWait, no, 1/2 is less than 2/3.\n\nBecause 1/2 is 0.5, and 2/3 is approximately 0.666.\n\nSo, A and B together have eaten less than their combined share.\n\nTherefore, they need to eat more of the remaining pizza to reach their one-third each.\n\nWhile C, who has eaten nothing, should eat his one-third share.\n\nSo, in that case, A and B should each get an additional 1/12 of the pizza, and C should get 1/3.\n\nAs we calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of the remaining half, A and B should each get 1/6 of the remaining half, and C should get 2/3 of the remaining half.\n\nWait, no, earlier we saw that A and B should each get 1/12 of the entire pizza from the remaining half.\n\nWait, let's double-check.\n\nRemaining pizza is 1/2.\n\nA needs to eat 1/12 more to reach 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, B needs to eat 1/12 more.\n\nC needs to eat 1/3.\n\nSo, 1/12 + 1/12 + 1/3 = 1/12 + 1/12 + 4/12 = 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in terms of the remaining half, A should get 1/12, which is 1/6 of the remaining half, since 1/12 divided by 1/2 is 1/6.\n\nSimilarly for B.\n\nAnd C should get 1/3 of the entire pizza from the remaining half, which is 2/3 of the remaining half.\n\nSo, the answer is that A and B should each get 1/6 of the remaining half, and C should get 2/3 of the remaining half.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of the entire pizza, A and B should each get an additional 1/12, and C should get 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that each person should get 1/3 of the pizza in total, with A and B getting an additional 1/12 each from the remaining half, and C getting 1/3 of the entire pizza from the remaining half.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Each person should get } \\dfrac{1}{3} \\text{ of the pizza in total.
