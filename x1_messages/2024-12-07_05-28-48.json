        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cruise line company adding a new ship to its fleet. The ship can carry 3,000 passengers and needs a crew of 1,200. There are some initial costs and annual operating costs to figure out. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial investment needed for the ship includes construction costs, outfitting and furnishing costs, and crew training expenses. According to the problem:\n\n- Construction costs: $500 million\n\n- Outfitting and furnishing costs: $100 million\n\n- Crew training expenses: $5 million\n\nTo find the total initial investment, I just need to add these three amounts together:\n\nTotal initial investment = construction costs + outfitting and furnishing costs + crew training expenses\n\nSo, that's $500 million + $100 million + $5 million = $605 million.\n\nAlright, that seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the annual operating costs. There are three components mentioned:\n\n- Fuel: $50,000 per day\n\n- Food and beverage expenses: $30 per passenger per day\n\n- Crew salaries: $60 million per year\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual fuel cost. If the ship operates every day of the year, then:\n\nAnnual fuel cost = fuel cost per day * number of days in a year\n\nAssuming 365 days per year:\n\nAnnual fuel cost = $50,000/day * 365 days/year = $18,250,000 per year\n\nNow, for food and beverage expenses, it's $30 per passenger per day. With 3,000 passengers:\n\nDaily food and beverage cost = $30/passenger/day * 3,000 passengers = $90,000 per day\n\nAnnual food and beverage cost = $90,000/day * 365 days/year = $32,850,000 per year\n\nAdding the crew salaries, which are already given as $60 million per year.\n\nNow, to find the total annual operating costs, I'll add up these three expenses:\n\nTotal annual operating costs = annual fuel cost + annual food and beverage cost + crew salaries\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal annual operating costs = $18,250,000 + $32,850,000 + $60,000,000 = $111,100,000 per year\n\nSo, the annual operating costs are $111.1 million.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot, but given the size of the ship and the number of passengers and crew members, it might be reasonable. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, initial investment:\n\n- Construction: $500,000,000\n\n- Outfitting: $100,000,000\n\n- Training: $5,000,000\n\nTotal: $605,000,000\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, annual operating costs:\n\n- Fuel: $50,000/day * 365 = $18,250,000\n\n- Food and beverage: $30/passenger/day * 3,000 passengers = $90,000/day\n\nThen, $90,000/day * 365 = $32,850,000 per year\n\n- Crew salaries: $60,000,000 per year\n\nTotal: $18,250,000 + $32,850,000 + $60,000,000 = $111,100,000 per year\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other possible costs that might be involved in operating a cruise ship. For example, port fees, maintenance costs, insurance, marketing, etc. However, based on the problem statement, it seems that only fuel, food and beverage, and crew salaries are to be considered for annual operating costs. So, I'll stick with the calculated amount.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the ship operates 365 days a year. Maybe cruise ships have downtime for maintenance or other reasons. But again, since the problem doesn't specify, I think assuming 365 days is acceptable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that passenger counts might not always be at full capacity, but since the problem gives the capacity as 3,000 passengers, and doesn't specify the occupancy rate, I'll assume it's running at full capacity for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nOverall, the initial investment is $605 million, and the annual operating costs are $111.1 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Initial investment: } \\$605 \\text{ million}, \\text{ annual operating costs: } \\$111.1 \\text{ million}}"
