        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Python. I need to create a program that takes a weighted graph represented with adjacency lists and a source vertex, then finds the shortest paths from that source to all other vertices in the graph.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what Dijkstra's algorithm is and how it works. Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree. It starts at the source vertex and explores the neighboring vertices, keeping track of the current shortest distance from the source to each vertex. It repeatedly selects the vertex with the smallest distance, updates the distances of its neighbors, and marks the vertex as visited. This process continues until all vertices have been visited.\n\nOkay, so to implement this, I need to represent the graph in Python. Since the graph is given as adjacency lists, I can use a dictionary where the keys are the vertices, and the values are lists of tuples representing the neighboring vertices and the weights of the edges connecting them.\n\nFor example, a graph like this:\n\n- A -> B: 1\n\n- A -> C: 4\n\n- B -> C: 2\n\n- B -> D: 5\n\n- C -> D: 1\n\nCould be represented as:\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],\n\n'B': [('C', 2), ('D', 5)],\n\n'C': [('D', 1)],\n\n'D': []\n\n}\n\nAlright, now I need to think about how to implement the algorithm step by step.\n\n1. Initialize the distance to the source vertex as 0 and to all other vertices as infinity.\n\n2. Create a set of unvisited vertices.\n\n3. While there are unvisited vertices:\n\na. Select the vertex with the smallest distance (that has not been visited yet).\n\nb. Mark it as visited.\n\nc. For each neighbor of this vertex:\n\ni. Calculate the distance to the neighbor through the current vertex.\n\nii. If this distance is less than the previously known distance to the neighbor, update the distance.\n\n4. Repeat steps 3a-3c until all vertices have been visited.\n\nI also need to keep track of the shortest paths, not just the distances. To do that, I can maintain a dictionary that keeps track of the previous vertex in the path for each vertex.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan in code:\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, source):\n\n# Initialize distances\n\ndistances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}\n\ndistances[source] = 0\n\n# Track visited vertices\n\nvisited = set()\n\n# Track previous vertices for path reconstruction\n\nprevious = {vertex: None for vertex in graph}\n\nwhile visited != set(graph.keys()):\n\n# Find the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance\n\ncurrent = min((vertex for vertex in graph if vertex not in visited), key=lambda v: distances[v])\n\nvisited.add(current)\n\n# Update distances for neighbors\n\nfor neighbor, weight in graph[current]:\n\nnew_distance = distances[current] + weight\n\nif new_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n\ndistances[neighbor] = new_distance\n\nprevious[neighbor] = current\n\n# Reconstruct paths\n\npaths = {}\n\nfor vertex in graph:\n\npath = []\n\ncurrent = vertex\n\nwhile current is not None:\n\npath.insert(0, current)\n\ncurrent = previous[current]\n\npaths[vertex] = path\n\nreturn distances, paths\n\nWait, but this might have some issues. For example, if there is no path to a vertex, the distance will remain infinity, and the path will be empty. That might be fine, but I need to handle it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the graph might not be connected, meaning there might be vertices unreachable from the source.\n\nLet me test this with a simple graph.\n\nTake the graph I mentioned earlier:\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],\n\n'B': [('C', 2), ('D', 5)],\n\n'C': [('D', 1)],\n\n'D': []\n\n}\n\nSource: 'A'\n\nInitialize distances:\n\nA: 0\n\nB: inf\n\nC: inf\n\nD: inf\n\nVisited: empty\n\nPrevious: all None\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nSelect 'A' (smallest distance, 0)\n\nMark 'A' as visited\n\nUpdate neighbors 'B' and 'C'\n\nDistance to 'B' through 'A': 0 + 1 = 1 < inf \u2192 update distance['B'] to 1, previous['B'] = 'A'\n\nDistance to 'C' through 'A': 0 + 4 = 4 < inf \u2192 update distance['C'] to 4, previous['C'] = 'A'\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nUnvisited: 'B', 'C', 'D'\n\nSelect 'B' (smallest distance, 1)\n\nMark 'B' as visited\n\nUpdate neighbors 'C' and 'D'\n\nDistance to 'C' through 'B': 1 + 2 = 3 < 4 \u2192 update distance['C'] to 3, previous['C'] = 'B'\n\nDistance to 'D' through 'B': 1 + 5 = 6 < inf \u2192 update distance['D'] to 6, previous['D'] = 'B'\n\nThird iteration:\n\nUnvisited: 'C', 'D'\n\nSelect 'C' (smallest distance, 3)\n\nMark 'C' as visited\n\nUpdate neighbors 'D'\n\nDistance to 'D' through 'C': 3 + 1 = 4 < 6 \u2192 update distance['D'] to 4, previous['D'] = 'C'\n\nFourth iteration:\n\nUnvisited: 'D'\n\nSelect 'D' (smallest distance, 4)\n\nMark 'D' as visited\n\nNo neighbors to update\n\nNow, distances:\n\nA: 0\n\nB: 1\n\nC: 3\n\nD: 4\n\nPaths:\n\nA: ['A']\n\nB: ['A', 'B']\n\nC: ['A', 'B', 'C']\n\nD: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\n\nSeems correct.\n\nBut what if there are negative weights? Wait, Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't handle negative weights. I need to make sure that the graph has non-negative weights.\n\nAlso, what if there are no paths to some vertices? Like if the graph is not connected.\n\nFor example:\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 1)],\n\n'B': [('C', 2)],\n\n'C': [],\n\n'D': [('E', 1)],\n\n'E': []\n\n}\n\nSource: 'A'\n\nIn this case, vertices 'D' and 'E' are not connected to the source 'A', so their distances should remain infinity, and paths should be empty.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitialize:\n\nA: 0\n\nB: inf\n\nC: inf\n\nD: inf\n\nE: inf\n\nVisited: empty\n\nPrevious: all None\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nSelect 'A' (0)\n\nMark 'A' as visited\n\nUpdate neighbors 'B'\n\nDistance to 'B' through 'A': 0 + 1 = 1 < inf \u2192 update distance['B'] to 1, previous['B'] = 'A'\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nUnvisited: 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'\n\nSelect 'B' (1)\n\nMark 'B' as visited\n\nUpdate neighbors 'C'\n\nDistance to 'C' through 'B': 1 + 2 = 3 < inf \u2192 update distance['C'] to 3, previous['C'] = 'B'\n\nThird iteration:\n\nUnvisited: 'C', 'D', 'E'\n\nSelect 'C' (3)\n\nMark 'C' as visited\n\nNo neighbors to update\n\nFourth iteration:\n\nUnvisited: 'D', 'E'\n\nSelect 'D' (inf)\n\nMark 'D' as visited\n\nUpdate neighbors 'E'\n\nDistance to 'E' through 'D': inf + 1 = inf < inf \u2192 no update\n\nFifth iteration:\n\nUnvisited: 'E'\n\nSelect 'E' (inf)\n\nMark 'E' as visited\n\nNo neighbors to update\n\nFinal distances:\n\nA: 0\n\nB: 1\n\nC: 3\n\nD: inf\n\nE: inf\n\nPaths:\n\nA: ['A']\n\nB: ['A', 'B']\n\nC: ['A', 'B', 'C']\n\nD: []\n\nE: []\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, in code, I need to handle the case where a vertex has no neighbors. Also, ensure that I don't run into errors when a vertex has no previous vertex (for the source) or when there is no path to a vertex.\n\nAlso, I should consider using a priority queue to select the vertex with the smallest distance more efficiently, especially for larger graphs. But for simplicity, I'll stick with the current approach.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, define the graph as a dictionary of adjacency lists with weights.\n\nThen, initialize distances, visited set, and previous dictionary.\n\nThen, loop until all vertices are visited:\n\n- Find the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance\n\n- Mark it as visited\n\n- Update the distances of its neighbors\n\nAfter that, reconstruct the paths using the previous dictionary.\n\nFor path reconstruction, I need to traverse back from each vertex to the source using the previous pointers.\n\nI need to handle the case where there is no path to a vertex, in which case the path should be empty.\n\nLet me try to write some pseudocode:\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, source):\n\ndistances = {vertex: infinity for vertex in graph}\n\ndistances[source] = 0\n\nvisited = set()\n\nprevious = {vertex: None for vertex in graph}\n\nwhile len(visited) < len(graph):\n\ncurrent = min(unvisited vertices, key=distances)\n\nvisited.add(current)\n\nfor neighbor, weight in graph[current]:\n\nnew_distance = distances[current] + weight\n\nif new_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n\ndistances[neighbor] = new_distance\n\nprevious[neighbor] = current\n\npaths = {}\n\nfor vertex in graph:\n\npath = []\n\ncurrent = vertex\n\nwhile previous[current] is not None:\n\npath.insert(0, current)\n\ncurrent = previous[current]\n\nif path and path[0] == source:\n\npath.insert(0, source)\n\npaths[vertex] = path\n\nreturn distances, paths\n\nWait, that path reconstruction seems off. Let me think again.\n\nStarting from the target vertex, I follow the previous pointers back to the source, then reverse the path.\n\nSo, for vertex 'D' in the first example:\n\nprevious['D'] = 'C'\n\nprevious['C'] = 'B'\n\nprevious['B'] = 'A'\n\nprevious['A'] = None\n\nSo, path: ['D', 'C', 'B', 'A']\n\nThen reverse it to ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn code, it would look like:\n\npath = []\n\ncurrent = vertex\n\nwhile previous[current] is not None:\n\npath.append(current)\n\ncurrent = previous[current]\n\npath.append(source)\n\npath.reverse()\n\npaths[vertex] = path\n\nBut I need to handle the case where there is no path to the vertex, i.e., previous[vertex] is None and vertex is not the source.\n\nIn that case, the path should be empty.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nfor vertex in graph:\n\nif previous[vertex] is None and vertex != source:\n\npaths[vertex] = []\n\nelse:\n\npath = []\n\ncurrent = vertex\n\nwhile previous[current] is not None:\n\npath.append(current)\n\ncurrent = previous[current]\n\npath.append(source)\n\npath.reverse()\n\npaths[vertex] = path\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation in Python.\n\nI need to represent the graph as a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of tuples (neighbor, weight).\n\nI need to handle non-string vertices as well, so I'll make sure to use generic vertex types.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the graph is empty or the source is not in the graph.\n\nLet me add some checks for that.\n\nIf the graph is empty, raise an error.\n\nIf the source is not in the graph, raise an error.\n\nAlso, ensure that all edges have non-negative weights, as Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't work with negative weights.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the graph has non-negative weights.\n\nLet me start writing the code.\n\nFirst, define the function:\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, source):\n\nif not graph:\n\nraise ValueError(\"Graph is empty\")\n\nif source not in graph:\n\nraise ValueError(f\"Source vertex {source} not in graph\")\n\n# Initialize distances\n\ndistances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}\n\ndistances[source] = 0\n\n# Track visited vertices\n\nvisited = set()\n\n# Track previous vertices for path reconstruction\n\nprevious = {vertex: None for vertex in graph}\n\nwhile len(visited) < len(graph):\n\n# Find the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance\n\ncurrent = min((vertex for vertex in graph if vertex not in visited), key=lambda v: distances[v])\n\nvisited.add(current)\n\n# Update distances for neighbors\n\nfor neighbor, weight in graph[current]:\n\nnew_distance = distances[current] + weight\n\nif new_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n\ndistances[neighbor] = new_distance\n\nprevious[neighbor] = current\n\n# Reconstruct paths\n\npaths = {}\n\nfor vertex in graph:\n\nif previous[vertex] is None and vertex != source:\n\npaths[vertex] = []\n\nelse:\n\npath = []\n\ncurrent = vertex\n\nwhile previous[current] is not None:\n\npath.append(current)\n\ncurrent = previous[current]\n\npath.append(source)\n\npath.reverse()\n\npaths[vertex] = path\n\nreturn distances, paths\n\nAlright, that seems straightforward.\n\nBut I should test this with some examples to make sure it works correctly.\n\nTake the first example:\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],\n\n'B': [('C', 2), ('D', 5)],\n\n'C': [('D', 1)],\n\n'D': []\n\n}\n\nsource = 'A'\n\nExpected distances: A:0, B:1, C:3, D:4\n\nExpected paths: A: ['A'], B: ['A','B'], C: ['A','B','C'], D: ['A','B','C','D']\n\nLet's run the function:\n\ndistances, paths = dijkstra(graph, 'A')\n\nprint(distances)\n\nprint(paths)\n\nShould output:\n\n{'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 3, 'D': 4}\n\n{'A': ['A'], 'B': ['A', 'B'], 'C': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'D': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']}\n\nNow, the second example:\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 1)],\n\n'B': [('C', 2)],\n\n'C': [],\n\n'D': [('E', 1)],\n\n'E': []\n\n}\n\nsource = 'A'\n\nExpected distances: A:0, B:1, C:3, D:inf, E:inf\n\nExpected paths: A: ['A'], B: ['A','B'], C: ['A','B','C'], D: [], E: []\n\nLet's run the function:\n\ndistances, paths = dijkstra(graph, 'A')\n\nprint(distances)\n\nprint(paths)\n\nShould output:\n\n{'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 3, 'D': inf, 'E': inf}\n\n{'A': ['A'], 'B': ['A', 'B'], 'C': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'D': [], 'E': []}\n\nSeems correct.\n\nNow, what if the source is 'D' in the second graph?\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 1)],\n\n'B': [('C', 2)],\n\n'C': [],\n\n'D': [('E', 1)],\n\n'E': []\n\n}\n\nsource = 'D'\n\nExpected distances: D:0, E:1, A:inf, B:inf, C:inf\n\nExpected paths: D: ['D'], E: ['D','E'], A: [], B: [], C: []\n\nLet's run the function:\n\ndistances, paths = dijkstra(graph, 'D')\n\nprint(distances)\n\nprint(paths)\n\nShould output:\n\n{'A': inf, 'B': inf, 'C': inf, 'D': 0, 'E': 1}\n\n{'A': [], 'B': [], 'C': [], 'D': ['D'], 'E': ['D', 'E']}\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, what if the graph has only one vertex?\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': []\n\n}\n\nsource = 'A'\n\nExpected distances: A:0\n\nExpected paths: A: ['A']\n\nLet's run the function:\n\ndistances, paths = dijkstra(graph, 'A')\n\nprint(distances)\n\nprint(paths)\n\nShould output:\n\n{'A': 0}\n\n{'A': ['A']}\n\nGood.\n\nWhat if the graph has multiple components?\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 1)],\n\n'B': [('C', 2)],\n\n'C': [('A', 3)],\n\n'D': [('E', 1)],\n\n'E': [('F', 1)],\n\n'F': [('D', 1)],\n\n'G': []\n\n}\n\nsource = 'A'\n\nExpected distances: A:0, B:1, C:3, D:inf, E:inf, F:inf, G:inf\n\nExpected paths: A: ['A'], B: ['A','B'], C: ['A','B','C'], D: [], E: [], F: [], G: []\n\nLet's run the function:\n\ndistances, paths = dijkstra(graph, 'A')\n\nprint(distances)\n\nprint(paths)\n\nShould output:\n\n{'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 3, 'D': inf, 'E': inf, 'F': inf, 'G': inf}\n\n{'A': ['A'], 'B': ['A', 'B'], 'C': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'D': [], 'E': [], 'F': [], 'G': []}\n\nLooks good.\n\nNow, what if there are multiple paths to a vertex, but one is shorter than the other?\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],\n\n'B': [('C', 2), ('D', 5)],\n\n'C': [('D', 1)],\n\n'D': []\n\n}\n\nsource = 'A'\n\nExpected shortest paths:\n\nA: 0\n\nB: 1\n\nC: 3 (through B)\n\nD: 4 (through C)\n\nPaths:\n\nA: ['A']\n\nB: ['A','B']\n\nC: ['A','B','C']\n\nD: ['A','B','C','D']\n\nYes, as in the first example.\n\nNow, what if there is a zero-weight edge?\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 0)],\n\n'B': []\n\n}\n\nsource = 'A'\n\nExpected distances: A:0, B:0\n\nPaths: A: ['A'], B: ['A','B']\n\nLet's run the function:\n\ndistances, paths = dijkstra(graph, 'A')\n\nprint(distances)\n\nprint(paths)\n\nShould output:\n\n{'A': 0, 'B': 0}\n\n{'A': ['A'], 'B': ['A', 'B']}\n\nGood.\n\nNow, what if there is a negative weight? Wait, Dijkstra's doesn't handle negative weights, so I should not test that.\n\nBut I should add a note in the code that this implementation assumes non-negative weights.\n\nAlso, I should consider the case where a vertex has no neighbors.\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [],\n\n'B': [('C', 1)],\n\n'C': []\n\n}\n\nsource = 'A'\n\nExpected distances: A:0, B:inf, C:inf\n\nPaths: A: ['A'], B: [], C: []\n\nLet's run the function:\n\ndistances, paths = dijkstra(graph, 'A')\n\nprint(distances)\n\nprint(paths)\n\nShould output:\n\n{'A': 0, 'B': inf, 'C': inf}\n\n{'A': ['A'], 'B': [], 'C': []}\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, think about the time complexity.\n\nIn this implementation, finding the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance takes O(V) time, and updating the neighbors takes O(E) time per iteration.\n\nSo overall time complexity is O(V^2 + E), which is acceptable for small to medium-sized graphs.\n\nFor larger graphs, I should consider using a priority queue to select the next vertex more efficiently.\n\nBut for now, this will do.\n\nNow, I need to write the actual Python code, including docstrings and comments for clarity.\n\nAlso, I should consider adding some test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.\n\nLet me summarize the steps:\n\n1. Validate the input graph and source.\n\n2. Initialize distances, visited set, and previous dictionary.\n\n3. While there are unvisited vertices:\n\na. Select the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance.\n\nb. Mark it as visited.\n\nc. Update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\n4. Reconstruct the paths using the previous dictionary.\n\n5. Return the distances and paths.\n\nI should also ensure that the graph dictionary contains all vertices, even those with no outgoing edges.\n\nFor example, in the earlier graph:\n\ngraph = {\n\n'A': [('B', 1)],\n\n'B': [('C', 2)],\n\n'C': [],\n\n'D': [('E', 1)],\n\n'E': []\n\n}\n\nMake sure that all vertices 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' are included in the distances and paths dictionaries.\n\nYes, in my current implementation, I initialize distances and previous for all vertices in the graph, so this should be fine.\n\nAlright, time to write the code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Python, we need to find the shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edges. The graph is represented using adjacency lists.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Set the distance to the source vertex as 0 and to all other vertices as infinity.\n   - Create a set to track visited vertices.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to track the previous vertex for path reconstruction.\n\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - While there are unvisited vertices:\n     - Select the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance.\n     - Update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n     - Mark the selected vertex as visited.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Use the previous vertex dictionary to build the shortest paths from the source to each vertex.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef dijkstra(graph, source):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.\n\n    Parameters:\n    graph (dict): A dictionary representing the graph where keys are vertices and values are lists of (neighbor, weight) tuples.\n    source: The starting vertex for paths.\n\n    Returns:\n    tuple: Two dictionaries, the first with distances from the source to each vertex, and the second with the shortest paths.\n    \"\"\"\n    import float\n\n    # Validate input\n    if not graph:\n        raise ValueError(\"Graph is empty\")\n    if source not in graph:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Source vertex {source} not in graph\")\n\n    # Initialize distances and previous vertices\n    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}\n    distances[source] = 0\n    visited = set()\n    previous = {vertex: None for vertex in graph}\n\n    while len(visited) < len(graph):\n        # Find the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance\n        current = min((vertex for vertex in graph if vertex not in visited), key=lambda v: distances[v])\n        visited.add(current)\n\n        # Update distances for neighbors\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current]:\n            new_distance = distances[current] + weight\n            if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = new_distance\n                previous[neighbor] = current\n\n    # Reconstruct paths\n    paths = {}\n    for vertex in graph:\n        if previous[vertex] is None and vertex != source:\n            paths[vertex] = []\n        else:\n            path = []\n            current = vertex\n            while previous[current] is not None:\n                path.append(current)\n                current = previous[current]\n            path.append(source)\n            path.reverse()\n            paths[vertex] = path\n\n    return distances, paths\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: We start by setting up the necessary data structures. Distances are initialized to infinity except for the source vertex, which is set to 0.\n- **Selecting the Vertex with the Smallest Distance**: We repeatedly select the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance, update the distances of its neighbors, and mark it as visited.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: For each vertex, we trace back from the vertex to the source using the 'previous' dictionary to construct the shortest path.\n\nThis implementation ensures that we efficiently find the shortest paths in graphs with non-negative edge weights."
