        "content": "So, the company pays its employees every 2 weeks, and an employee earns $1200 per month. We need to find out how much the employee earns in each pay period, which is every 2 weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between months and 2-week periods. A month typically has about 4 weeks, so 2 weeks would be half a month. But actually, months vary in length, so to be more precise, I should calculate based on the actual number of weeks in a year.\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year. If the company pays every 2 weeks, then the number of pay periods in a year would be 52 divided by 2, which is 26 pay periods.\n\nNow, if the employee earns $1200 per month, and there are 12 months in a year, then the annual salary would be:\n\n$1200 per month \u00d7 12 months = $14,400 per year.\n\nWait, that seems too low for a monthly salary of $1200. Maybe I misread. Let me check that.\n\nActually, $1200 per month seems reasonable. So, annual salary would indeed be $1200 \u00d7 12 = $14,400 per year.\n\nNow, if there are 26 pay periods in a year, then the pay per period would be the annual salary divided by the number of pay periods.\n\nSo, pay per period = $14,400 \u00f7 26.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 26 \u00d7 500 = 13,000.\n\nSubtract that from 14,400: 14,400 - 13,000 = 1,400.\n\nNow, 26 \u00d7 50 = 1,300.\n\nSubtract that from 1,400: 1,400 - 1,300 = 100.\n\nSo, 26 \u00d7 54 = 1,300 + 100 = 1,400.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should use division directly.\n\n$14,400 \u00f7 26.\n\nLet's do the division step by step.\n\n26 \u00d7 500 = 13,000.\n\nSubtract 13,000 from 14,400: 1,400.\n\n26 \u00d7 50 = 1,300.\n\nSubtract 1,300 from 1,400: 100.\n\n26 \u00d7 3 = 78.\n\nSubtract 78 from 100: 22.\n\n26 \u00d7 0.8 = 20.8.\n\nSubtract 20.8 from 22: 1.2.\n\n26 \u00d7 0.04 = 0.104.\n\nSubtract that: 1.2 - 0.104 = 1.096.\n\nThis is getting too messy. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the pay period is every 2 weeks, and there are 4 weeks in a month, the employee is getting paid 4 \u00f7 2 = 2 times a month.\n\nWait, but that would mean 2 pay periods per month, and 12 months in a year, so 24 pay periods in a year.\n\nBut earlier, I thought there are 26 pay periods in a year because 52 weeks \u00f7 2 = 26.\n\nHmm, which one is correct?\n\nActually, the number of pay periods in a year when paid every 2 weeks is indeed 26, because 52 weeks \u00f7 2 = 26.\n\nBut if we consider months having 4 weeks, then 4 \u00f7 2 = 2 pay periods per month, and 2 \u00d7 12 = 24 pay periods in a year.\n\nBut that doesn't match the 26 pay periods from the weekly calculation.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to stick with the weekly basis for accuracy.\n\nTherefore, with 26 pay periods in a year, and annual salary of $14,400, the pay per period is $14,400 \u00f7 26.\n\nLet me calculate that properly.\n\nFirst, 26 \u00d7 500 = 13,000.\n\nSubtract 13,000 from 14,400: 1,400.\n\nThen, 26 \u00d7 50 = 1,300.\n\nSubtract 1,300 from 1,400: 100.\n\nNext, 26 \u00d7 3 = 78.\n\nSubtract 78 from 100: 22.\n\nThen, 26 \u00d7 0.8 = 20.8.\n\nSubtract 20.8 from 22: 1.2.\n\nAfter that, 26 \u00d7 0.04 = 1.04.\n\nSubtract 1.04 from 1.2: 0.16.\n\nContinuing, 26 \u00d7 0.006 = 0.0156.\n\nSubtract that: 0.16 - 0.0156 = 0.1444.\n\nThis is getting too small and complicated.\n\nMaybe I should use a calculator for this division.\n\nUsing a calculator, $14,400 \u00f7 26 = $553.846153846...\n\nRounded to two decimal places, that's $553.85.\n\nSo, the employee earns approximately $553.85 in each 2-week pay period.\n\nBut let's check another way to see if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, since there are 26 pay periods in a year, and 12 months in a year, the pay per period would be monthly salary \u00d7 (2 weeks / average weeks per month).\n\nAverage weeks per month are approximately 4.33 weeks (since 52 weeks \u00f7 12 months = 4.333 weeks per month).\n\nSo, pay per period = $1200 \u00d7 (2 / 4.33) \u2248 $1200 \u00d7 0.4611 \u2248 $553.32.\n\nThis is close to the earlier calculation of $553.85.\n\nThe slight difference is due to rounding errors.\n\nTherefore, the employee earns approximately $553.85 in each 2-week pay period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{553.85} \\]"
