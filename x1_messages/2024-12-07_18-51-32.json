        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which is 120 miles apart, and it takes 2 hours to do that. It's traveling at a constant speed, so first, I should probably find out what that speed is.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time, right? So, speed equals 120 miles divided by 2 hours, which is 60 miles per hour. Okay, so the train's speed is 60 mph.\n\nNow, the question is asking how long it will take for the train to travel half of the distance back to Town A. Half of the distance between Town B and Town A is half of 120 miles, which is 60 miles.\n\nSo, the train is going back from Town B to Town A, and we're only interested in half the distance, which is 60 miles, and we've already determined that the train's speed is 60 mph.\n\nTime is distance divided by speed. So, time equals 60 miles divided by 60 mph, which is 1 hour.\n\nWait a minute, is that all there is to it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nThe train goes from A to B: 120 miles in 2 hours, so speed is 60 mph.\n\nNow, going back from B to A, half the distance is 60 miles, at the same speed of 60 mph.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 60 miles / 60 mph = 1 hour.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I don't think there's any trick here. The train will take 1 hour to travel half the distance back to Town A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]"
