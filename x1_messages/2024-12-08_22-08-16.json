        "content": "Alright, I'm going to guide you through creating a simple Java application that interacts with a Memcached server. We'll cover connecting to the server, storing key-value pairs, retrieving values by keys, and deleting keys from the cache.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine.\n2. **Memcached server** running on your local machine or a specified host.\n3. **Spymemcached client library** to interact with Memcached from Java.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Project\n\nFirst, create a new Java project in your preferred IDE or set up a basic project structure manually.\n\n### Step 2: Add Dependencies\n\nYou need to include the Spymemcached library in your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>net.spy</groupId>\n    <artifactId>spymemcached</artifactId>\n    <version>2.12.3</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nIf you're not using Maven, download the Spymemcached JAR and add it to your project's classpath.\n\n### Step 3: Connect to Memcached Server\n\nCreate a Java class to handle the connection and operations with Memcached.\n\n```java\nimport net.spy.memcached.MemcachedClient;\n\nimport java.net.InetSocketAddress;\n\npublic class MemcachedExample {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Connect to the Memcached server running on localhost at port 11211\n            MemcachedClient memcachedClient = new MemcachedClient(new InetSocketAddress(\"localhost\", 11211));\n            System.out.println(\"Connected to Memcached server successfully.\");\n\n            // Perform operations...\n            \n            // Close the connection\n            memcachedClient.shutdown();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Store Key-Value Pairs\n\nTo store data in Memcached, use the `set` method.\n\n```java\n// Store a key-value pair\nmemcachedClient.set(\"key1\", 3600, \"value1\").get();\nSystem.out.println(\"Stored key1 with value1\");\n```\n\n### Step 5: Retrieve Values by Keys\n\nTo retrieve data, use the `get` method.\n\n```java\n// Retrieve value by key\nObject value = memcachedClient.get(\"key1\");\nSystem.out.println(\"Retrieved value for key1: \" + value);\n```\n\n### Step 6: Delete Keys from the Cache\n\nTo delete a key from the cache, use the `delete` method.\n\n```java\n// Delete a key\nmemcachedClient.delete(\"key1\").get();\nSystem.out.println(\"Deleted key1\");\n```\n\n### Complete Example\n\nHere's the complete Java class combining all the steps:\n\n```java\nimport net.spy.memcached.MemcachedClient;\n\nimport java.net.InetSocketAddress;\n\npublic class MemcachedExample {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Connect to the Memcached server\n            MemcachedClient memcachedClient = new MemcachedClient(new InetSocketAddress(\"localhost\", 11211));\n            System.out.println(\"Connected to Memcached server successfully.\");\n\n            // Store a key-value pair\n            memcachedClient.set(\"key1\", 3600, \"value1\").get();\n            System.out.println(\"Stored key1 with value1\");\n\n            // Retrieve value by key\n            Object value = memcachedClient.get(\"key1\");\n            System.out.println(\"Retrieved value for key1: \" + value);\n\n            // Delete a key\n            memcachedClient.delete(\"key1\").get();\n            System.out.println(\"Deleted key1\");\n\n            // Close the connection\n            memcachedClient.shutdown();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1. Ensure Memcached is running on your machine or update the connection details accordingly.\n2. Compile and run the Java application.\n\nThis should connect to the Memcached server, store a key-value pair, retrieve it, print the value, delete the key, and then close the connection.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **Connection Issues:** Ensure Memcached is running and accessible at the specified host and port.\n- **Dependency Issues:** Make sure the Spymemcached library is correctly included in your project.\n- **Exception Handling:** Add proper exception handling for robustness in production code.\n\nThat's it! You've created a basic Java application that interacts with a Memcached server."
