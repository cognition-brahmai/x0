Each part of your plan should align with an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions when given an input string that could be the user's question, former evidence values, or both.\n\nYou can make use of these tools:\n1. Baidu[input]: This tool permits the user to execute an internet search using the Baidu search engine. It generates a list of probable websites that may encompass the answer to the user's question.\n2. WebExplorer[input]: This function loads one or more websites from the input string (comprising newline-separated links) and renders the textual content of these sites.\n3. LinkFinder[input]: This tool sifts through plain text and outputs them as a newline-separated list of links.\n4. DataInterpreter[input]: An AI-driven language model proficient at answering questions grounded on an input text passage. The input should be a question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should conform to the following template:\nPlan: [Initial action rooted in the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function invocation with input parameter]\nPlan: [Subsequent action hinged on the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function invocation with input parameter, potentially alluding to previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the conclusive reply]\n\nQuestion: Can you explain the concept of quantum entanglement and its implications in quantum computing?"
