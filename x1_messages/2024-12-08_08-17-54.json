        "content": "Let's see. So, the factory produces both cars and trucks, and I need to figure out how many cars they made based on the total number of vehicles and wheels. Okay, first things first, I know that each car has 4 wheels and each truck has 6 wheels. The total number of vehicles is 100, and the total number of wheels is 480.\n\nI think I should start by setting up some equations. Let's say \"c\" represents the number of cars, and \"t\" represents the number of trucks. Since the total number of vehicles is 100, I can write:\n\nc + t = 100\n\nThat makes sense. Now, for the wheels. Each car has 4 wheels, so the total number of wheels from cars is 4c. Each truck has 6 wheels, so the total number of wheels from trucks is 6t. The total number of wheels is 480, so:\n\n4c + 6t = 480\n\nAlright, now I have a system of two equations:\n\n1) c + t = 100\n\n2) 4c + 6t = 480\n\nI need to solve for c, which is the number of cars. Maybe I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute into the second equation. Let's solve the first equation for t:\n\nt = 100 - c\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n4c + 6(100 - c) = 480\n\nOkay, now I can distribute the 6:\n\n4c + 600 - 6c = 480\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n-2c + 600 = 480\n\nNext, subtract 600 from both sides:\n\n-2c = -120\n\nNow, divide both sides by -2:\n\nc = 60\n\nSo, the factory produced 60 cars.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If c = 60, then t = 100 - 60 = 40. Now, let's calculate the total wheels:\n\nCars: 60 cars * 4 wheels/car = 240 wheels\n\nTrucks: 40 trucks * 6 wheels/truck = 240 wheels\n\nTotal wheels: 240 + 240 = 480 wheels, which matches the given total.\n\nLooks good! Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. For example, I could think about the average number of wheels per vehicle. Total wheels are 480 for 100 vehicles, so the average number of wheels per vehicle is 480 / 100 = 4.8 wheels/vehicle.\n\nNow, since cars have 4 wheels and trucks have 6 wheels, the average being 4.8 suggests that most vehicles are cars, but there are some trucks raising the average above 4.\n\nTo find the exact number, I could set up a proportion. Let's see.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the proportion of cars as p, so the proportion of trucks is 1 - p.\n\nThen, the average number of wheels is:\n\naverage = 4*p + 6*(1 - p) = 4p + 6 - 6p = 6 - 2p\n\nWe know the average is 4.8, so:\n\n6 - 2p = 4.8\n\nNow, solve for p:\n\n-2p = 4.8 - 6\n\n-2p = -1.2\n\np = -1.2 / -2\n\np = 0.6\n\nSo, 60% of the vehicles are cars. Since there are 100 vehicles, that's 60 cars, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nAnother way could be to think about the difference in wheels. If all 100 vehicles were cars, there would be 100 * 4 = 400 wheels. But there are actually 480 wheels, which is 80 wheels more than if all were cars.\n\nEach truck has 2 more wheels than a car (6 - 4 = 2). So, the number of trucks is 80 / 2 = 40 trucks. Therefore, the number of cars is 100 - 40 = 60 cars.\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nI think I've confirmed that the factory produced 60 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
