        "content": "Certainly! I'll help you write a Python script that uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order, with the input coming from the command line as space-separated numbers.\n\nFirst, let's understand what bubble sort is. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan for our script:\n\n1. **Accept input from the command line:** We'll use the `sys` module to get command-line arguments.\n\n2. **Parse the input:** Convert the space-separated numbers into a list of integers.\n\n3. **Implement the bubble sort algorithm:** We'll write a function that sorts the list in ascending order using the bubble sort method.\n\n4. **Print the sorted list:** After sorting, we'll print the sorted list.\n\nLet's start by writing the code to accept and parse the input.\n\n### Step 1: Accepting and Parsing Input\n\nWe'll use the `sys.argv` list to get the command-line arguments. The first element, `sys.argv[0]`, is the script name, so the numbers will start from `sys.argv[1]`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Get command line arguments\n    args = sys.argv[1:]\n    \n    # Convert arguments to integers\n    try:\n        numbers = [int(arg) for arg in args]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please enter valid integers separated by spaces.\")\n        return\n    \n    # Call the bubble sort function\n    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n    \n    # Print the sorted list\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implementing the Bubble Sort Algorithm\n\nNow, let's implement the `bubble_sort` function. Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.\n\nHere's how we can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Traverse through all elements in the list\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            # Traverse the list from 0 to n-i-1\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Complete Script\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete Python script:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Traverse through all elements in the list\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            # Traverse the list from 0 to n-i-1\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n\ndef main():\n    # Get command line arguments\n    args = sys.argv[1:]\n    \n    # Convert arguments to integers\n    try:\n        numbers = [int(arg) for arg in args]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please enter valid integers separated by spaces.\")\n        return\n    \n    # Call the bubble sort function\n    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n    \n    # Print the sorted list\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling:** We retrieve the command-line arguments using `sys.argv[1:]` and convert them to integers.\n2. **Bubble Sort Implementation:** We sort the list using the bubble sort algorithm, which involves multiple passes through the list, comparing and swapping adjacent elements as needed.\n3. **Output:** Finally, we print the sorted list.\n\nThis script will sort any list of integers provided as space-separated command-line arguments using the bubble sort algorithm."
