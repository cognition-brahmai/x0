        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people who want to split a $300 bill evenly among themselves. If three more people join the group, each person would pay $10 less. We need to find out how many people are initially in the group.\n\nFirst, let's define the initial number of people in the group as \\( n \\). Since they're splitting $300 evenly, each person would pay \\( \\frac{300}{n} \\) dollars.\n\nNow, if three more people join the group, the number of people becomes \\( n + 3 \\). In this new scenario, each person would pay \\( \\frac{300}{n + 3} \\) dollars, and we're told that this amount is $10 less than what each person would pay in the initial scenario. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{n} - \\frac{300}{n + 3} = 10\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to solve for \\( n \\). Let's start by finding a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for \\( n \\) and \\( n + 3 \\) is \\( n(n + 3) \\). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300(n + 3) - 300n}{n(n + 3)} = 10\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\n300(n + 3) - 300n = 300n + 900 - 300n = 900\n\\]\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{900}{n(n + 3)} = 10\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the denominator, multiply both sides by \\( n(n + 3) \\):\n\n\\[\n900 = 10n(n + 3)\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 10 to simplify:\n\n\\[\n90 = n(n + 3)\n\\]\n\nNow, expand the right side:\n\n\\[\n90 = n^2 + 3n\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 3n - 90 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can solve for \\( n \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nIn this equation, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = -90 \\). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(-90)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 360}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{369}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{369} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 41} = 3\\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 + 3\\sqrt{41}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\frac{-3 - 3\\sqrt{41}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince the number of people can't be negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 + 3\\sqrt{41}}{2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, \\( \\sqrt{41} \\) is approximately 6.403, so:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 + 3 \\times 6.403}{2} = \\frac{-3 + 19.209}{2} = \\frac{16.209}{2} \\approx 8.1045\n\\]\n\nBut the number of people should be a whole number. It seems like there might have been a miscalculation earlier. Let's double-check the quadratic equation setup.\n\nStarting again from:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{n} - \\frac{300}{n + 3} = 10\n\\]\n\nAfter simplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{900}{n(n + 3)} = 10\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n900 = 10n(n + 3)\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n\\[\n90 = n^2 + 3n\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 3n - 90 = 0\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in solving this quadratic equation. Let's try factoring or use the quadratic formula again more carefully.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -90 and add up to 3. Those numbers are 10 and -9.\n\nSo, we can factor the quadratic equation as:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 3n - 90 = (n + 10)(n - 9) = 0\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor to zero:\n\n\\[\nn + 10 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n - 9 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nn = -10 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n = 9\n\\]\n\nAgain, the number of people can't be negative, so \\( n = 9 \\).\n\nLet's verify this solution. If initially, there are 9 people, each would pay \\( \\frac{300}{9} = 33.\\overline{3} \\) dollars.\n\nIf three more people join, making it 12 people, each would pay \\( \\frac{300}{12} = 25 \\) dollars.\n\nIs 25 dollars less than 33.\\overline{3} dollars by 8.\\overline{3} dollars, not 10 dollars as the problem states. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in my calculation. Let's check again.\n\nIf \\( n = 9 \\):\n\nOriginal payment per person: \\( \\frac{300}{9} = 33.\\overline{3} \\) dollars.\n\nAfter three more people join, total people: 12.\n\nNew payment per person: \\( \\frac{300}{12} = 25 \\) dollars.\n\nDifference: \\( 33.\\overline{3} - 25 = 8.\\overline{3} \\) dollars, which is not equal to 10 dollars as stated in the problem.\n\nSo, there's an inconsistency. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me revisit the original setup. The equation I initially set up was:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{n} - \\frac{300}{n + 3} = 10\n\\]\n\nBut according to the verification, this leads to a solution that doesn't satisfy the condition. Perhaps the equation should be set up differently.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let's read it again: \"If three more people join the group, each person would pay $10 less.\" Does this mean that the new payment is $10 less than the original payment?\n\nI think that's what it means. So, my initial equation seems correct. But the solution doesn't satisfy the condition. Maybe there's a mistake in the factoring or solving the quadratic equation.\n\nLet me solve the quadratic equation again:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 3n - 90 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(-90)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 360}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{369}}{2}\n\\]\n\nWait, \\( \\sqrt{369} \\) is not 19.209; let's calculate it properly.\n\nActually, \\( 19^2 = 361 \\) and \\( 20^2 = 400 \\), so \\( \\sqrt{369} \\) is approximately 19.209, but earlier I used this approximation and got \\( n \\approx 8.1045 \\), which isn't an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is not an integer. But it's unusual for the number of people to be a fraction. Maybe I need to consider that the number of people is 9, even though the verification didn't match exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of people is 10 - 3 = 7.\n\nWait, let's try plugging in n = 10 and see what happens.\n\nIf n = 10:\n\nOriginal payment: 300 / 10 = 30 dollars.\n\nAfter three more people join: n + 3 = 13.\n\nNew payment: 300 / 13 \u2248 23.0769 dollars.\n\nDifference: 30 - 23.0769 \u2248 6.9231, which is not 10 dollars.\n\nNot matching.\n\nTry n = 15:\n\nOriginal payment: 300 / 15 = 20 dollars.\n\nAfter three more people: n + 3 = 18.\n\nNew payment: 300 / 18 \u2248 16.6667 dollars.\n\nDifference: 20 - 16.6667 \u2248 3.3333, not 10.\n\nNot matching.\n\nTry n = 6:\n\nOriginal payment: 300 / 6 = 50 dollars.\n\nAfter three more people: n + 3 = 9.\n\nNew payment: 300 / 9 \u2248 33.3333 dollars.\n\nDifference: 50 - 33.3333 \u2248 16.6667, not 10.\n\nNot matching.\n\nTry n = 12:\n\nOriginal payment: 300 / 12 = 25 dollars.\n\nAfter three more people: n + 3 = 15.\n\nNew payment: 300 / 15 = 20 dollars.\n\nDifference: 25 - 20 = 5 dollars, not 10.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, none of these integer values for n seem to satisfy the condition that the difference is exactly 10 dollars. Yet, the quadratic equation led me to n \u2248 8.1045, which isn't an integer.\n\nMaybe the number of initial people isn't an integer, which seems unlikely in this context. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my setup.\n\nLet me try setting up the equation differently. Maybe I should consider the total bill and the payments.\n\nLet \\( n \\) be the initial number of people.\n\nOriginal payment per person: \\( p = \\frac{300}{n} \\).\n\nAfter three more people join: \\( n + 3 \\).\n\nNew payment per person: \\( p - 10 = \\frac{300}{n + 3} \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{n} - 10 = \\frac{300}{n + 3}\n\\]\n\nThis is a different setup. Previously, I had:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{n} - \\frac{300}{n + 3} = 10\n\\]\n\nBut perhaps it should be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{n} - 10 = \\frac{300}{n + 3}\n\\]\n\nLet me solve this equation.\n\nFirst, move all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{n} - 10 - \\frac{300}{n + 3} = 0\n\\]\n\nFind a common denominator, which is \\( n(n + 3) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300(n + 3) - 10n(n + 3) - 300n}{n(n + 3)} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\n300n + 900 - 10n^2 - 30n - 300n = -10n^2 - 30n + 900\n\\]\n\nSet the numerator equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n-10n^2 - 30n + 900 = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide the entire equation by -10 to simplify:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 3n - 90 = 0\n\\]\n\nWait, this is the same quadratic equation as before. So, it seems that both setups lead to the same equation, meaning my initial approach was correct.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the solution \\( n = \\frac{-3 + 3\\sqrt{41}}{2} \\) is approximately 8.1045, which isn't an integer, it suggests that the number of initial people isn't a whole number. However, the number of people should be an integer.\n\nThis inconsistency might indicate an error in the problem statement or in my interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the exact solution rather than an integer.\n\nGiven that, the initial number of people is \\( n = \\frac{-3 + 3\\sqrt{41}}{2} \\), which is approximately 8.1045. But since the number of people must be a whole number, it's likely that the problem anticipates rounding or has a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the difference is exactly $10, and see if there's an integer solution close to 8.1045 that satisfies the condition.\n\nLet's try n = 8:\n\nOriginal payment: 300 / 8 = 37.5 dollars.\n\nAfter three more people: n + 3 = 11.\n\nNew payment: 300 / 11 \u2248 27.2727 dollars.\n\nDifference: 37.5 - 27.2727 \u2248 10.2273, which is close to but not exactly 10 dollars.\n\nNot perfect.\n\nTry n = 9:\n\nOriginal payment: 300 / 9 \u2248 33.3333 dollars.\n\nAfter three more people: n + 3 = 12.\n\nNew payment: 300 / 12 = 25 dollars.\n\nDifference: 33.3333 - 25 = 8.3333, which is less than 10.\n\nNot matching.\n\nTry n = 7:\n\nOriginal payment: 300 / 7 \u2248 42.8571 dollars.\n\nAfter three more people: n + 3 = 10.\n\nNew payment: 300 / 10 = 30 dollars.\n\nDifference: 42.8571 - 30 = 12.8571, which is more than 10.\n\nNot matching.\n\nIt seems that there isn't an integer value of n that satisfies the condition exactly. Given this, the solution must be the exact value from the quadratic equation, which is \\( n = \\frac{-3 + 3\\sqrt{41}}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, for practical purposes, the number of people should be a whole number. Perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number, which would be 8 people initially.\n\nBut to be precise, the exact number is \\( n = \\frac{-3 + 3\\sqrt{41}}{2} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{-3 + 3\\sqrt{41}}{2}} \\]"
