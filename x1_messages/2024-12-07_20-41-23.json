        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses on the left side and 12 on the right side, making a total of 22 houses. But one house on the left is empty because of renovation, so only 21 houses are occupied. Each occupied house has 4 people living in it. So, to find out how many people live on the street, I need to multiply the number of occupied houses by the number of people per house.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of houses:\n\n10 (left) + 12 (right) = 22 houses.\n\nBut one house is empty, so:\n\n22 - 1 = 21 houses are occupied.\n\nEach occupied house has 4 people, so:\n\n21 houses * 4 people/house = 84 people.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor to consider? The empty house has no one living in it, so it shouldn't be included in the calculation. I think that's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of houses that are occupied and then multiply by the number of people per house.\n\nTotal occupied houses:\n\nLeft side: 10 houses - 1 empty = 9 occupied.\n\nRight side: 12 houses, all occupied.\n\nSo, 9 (left) + 12 (right) = 21 occupied houses.\n\nThen, 21 occupied houses * 4 people/house = 84 people.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nSuppose I calculate the total number of people if all houses were occupied:\n\n22 houses * 4 people/house = 88 people.\n\nBut since one house is empty, I need to subtract the 4 people that would have been in that house.\n\nSo, 88 - 4 = 84 people.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think 84 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]"
