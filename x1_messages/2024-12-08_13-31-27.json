        "content": "Let's tackle this bacteria growth problem. So, we've got a colony that starts with 10 bacteria and doubles in size every hour. We need to find out how many there will be after 5 hours. I think there are a few different ways to approach this, and I'll try to generate several possible answers using different mathematical methods. Then, I'll rank them based on accuracy and pick the best one.\n\n**First method:Repeated Multiplication**\n\nSince the colony doubles every hour, I can just keep multiplying the current number of bacteria by 2 for each hour that passes.\n\nStart: 10 bacteria\n\nAfter 1 hour: 10 \u00d7 2 = 20\n\nAfter 2 hours: 20 \u00d7 2 = 40\n\nAfter 3 hours: 40 \u00d7 2 = 80\n\nAfter 4 hours: 80 \u00d7 2 = 160\n\nAfter 5 hours: 160 \u00d7 2 = 320\n\nSo, after 5 hours, there would be 320 bacteria.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but maybe there's a more efficient way to calculate this, especially if we're dealing with longer periods of time.\n\n**Second method:Exponential Growth Formula**\n\nI recall that exponential growth can be modeled by the formula:\n\n\\[ N = N_0 \u00d7 2^{(t/T)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the final amount\n\n- \\( N_0 \\) is the initial amount\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time elapsed\n\n- \\( T \\) is the doubling time\n\nIn this case, \\( N_0 = 10 \\), \\( t = 5 \\) hours, and \\( T = 1 \\) hour.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ N = 10 \u00d7 2^{(5/1)} = 10 \u00d7 2^5 = 10 \u00d7 32 = 320 \\]\n\nAgain, 320 bacteria after 5 hours.\n\nThis matches the first method, which is a good sign. But maybe there are other ways to look at it.\n\n**Third method:Logarithmic Approach**\n\nHmm, using logarithms might be a bit unusual for this problem, but let's see.\n\nIf the colony doubles every hour, and starts at 10, then after t hours, the number of bacteria is \\( N = 10 \u00d7 2^t \\).\n\nWe can take the logarithm of both sides to solve for t, but in this case, t is given as 5 hours, so it's maybe not the best approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use logarithms to find out how long it takes to reach a certain number, but since we're given time and need to find the amount, this might not be the most direct method.\n\nLet me try plugging in t=5 anyway:\n\n\\[ N = 10 \u00d7 2^5 = 10 \u00d7 32 = 320 \\]\n\nAgain, 320. So, even using this approach, we get the same answer.\n\n**Fourth method:Graphical Approach**\n\nI could plot the growth of the bacteria over time on a graph, with time in hours on the x-axis and the number of bacteria on the y-axis.\n\nStarting at (0,10), then (1,20), (2,40), (3,80), (4,160), and (5,320). By plotting these points and connecting them with a smooth curve, I can visualize the exponential growth.\n\nWhile this visual method confirms the numerical results, it's not as precise for finding exact numbers without plotting accurately scaled axes.\n\n**Fifth method:Using Natural Logarithm and Continuous Growth Formula**\n\nI know that some exponential growth problems can be modeled using the continuous growth formula:\n\n\\[ N = N_0 \u00d7 e^{(kt)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the final amount\n\n- \\( N_0 \\) is the initial amount\n\n- \\( k \\) is the growth rate\n\n- \\( t \\) is time\n\nIn this case, since the colony doubles every hour, I can find k first.\n\nGiven that \\( N = 2 \u00d7 N_0 \\) when \\( t = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \u00d7 N_0 = N_0 \u00d7 e^{(k \u00d7 1)} \\]\n\n\\[ 2 = e^k \\]\n\n\\[ k = \\ln(2) \\]\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[ N = 10 \u00d7 e^{(\\ln(2) \u00d7 t)} \\]\n\nFor t=5:\n\n\\[ N = 10 \u00d7 e^{(\\ln(2) \u00d7 5)} = 10 \u00d7 e^{(0.6931 \u00d7 5)} = 10 \u00d7 e^{3.4657} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator for \\( e^{3.4657} \\):\n\n\\[ e^{3.4657} \\approx 32 \\]\n\nSo, \\( N = 10 \u00d7 32 = 320 \\)\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\n**Sixth method:Sum of Geometric Series**\n\nConsidering that each hour the bacteria double, this forms a geometric series where each term is twice the previous one.\n\nThe general formula for the sum of a geometric series is:\n\n\\[ S_n = a \u00d7 \\frac{(r^n - 1)}{(r - 1)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the first n terms\n\n- \\( a \\) is the first term\n\n- \\( r \\) is the common ratio\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms\n\nIn this case, the first term \\( a = 10 \\), the common ratio \\( r = 2 \\), and \\( n = 5 \\) hours.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ S_5 = 10 \u00d7 \\frac{(2^5 - 1)}{(2 - 1)} = 10 \u00d7 \\frac{(32 - 1)}{1} = 10 \u00d7 31 = 310 \\]\n\nWait, this gives 310, which differs from the previous methods that gave 320.\n\nI think I might have misapplied the geometric series formula here. Let's double-check.\n\nActually, the geometric series sum formula is for the sum of the terms, but in this bacteria growth scenario, we're not summing the terms; we're looking for the value at the nth term.\n\nThe nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:\n\n\\[ a_n = a \u00d7 r^{(n-1)} \\]\n\nSo, for n=5:\n\n\\[ a_5 = 10 \u00d7 2^{(5-1)} = 10 \u00d7 2^4 = 10 \u00d7 16 = 160 \\]\n\nThat's different from both 320 and 310. This suggests I've applied the geometric sequence formula incorrectly for this context.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to adjust the formula because the growth starts at time 0.\n\nLet me try indexing from 0:\n\n- At t=0: 10 bacteria\n\n- At t=1: 20\n\n- At t=2: 40\n\n- At t=3: 80\n\n- At t=4: 160\n\n- At t=5: 320\n\nSo, if I consider t as the exponent, it matches the exponential growth formula.\n\nTherefore, the geometric series sum formula isn't directly applicable here because we're not summing the bacteria over time; we're looking for the value at a specific time point.\n\n**Seventh method: Differential Equation Approach**\n\nBacterial growth can be modeled by the differential equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dN}{dt} = kN \\]\n\nwhere \\( N \\) is the number of bacteria and \\( k \\) is the growth rate.\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{kt} \\]\n\nGiven that the population doubles every hour, we can find \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ N(1) = 2N_0 = N_0 e^{k\u00d71} \\]\n\n\\[ 2 = e^k \\]\n\n\\[ k = \\ln(2) \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{(\\ln(2) \u00d7 t)} \\]\n\nFor t=5:\n\n\\[ N(5) = 10 \u00d7 e^{(\\ln(2) \u00d7 5)} = 10 \u00d7 e^{(0.6931 \u00d7 5)} = 10 \u00d7 e^{3.4657} \\approx 10 \u00d7 32 = 320 \\]\n\nAgain, 320 bacteria.\n\n**Eighth method: Rule of 70**\n\nThe Rule of 70 is a way to estimate doubling time for exponential growth. However, in this case, we already know the doubling time is 1 hour, so this method isn't directly applicable. It's more useful for finding doubling time when the growth rate is known.\n\n**Ninth method: Proportional Reasoning**\n\nIf the bacteria double every hour, then each hour the number is multiplied by 2.\n\nStarting with 10 bacteria:\n\nAfter 1 hour: 10 \u00d7 2 = 20\n\nAfter 2 hours: 20 \u00d7 2 = 40\n\nAfter 3 hours: 40 \u00d7 2 = 80\n\nAfter 4 hours: 80 \u00d7 2 = 160\n\nAfter 5 hours: 160 \u00d7 2 = 320\n\nThis is similar to the first method and again gives 320.\n\n**Tenth method: Binary Exponentiation**\n\nThis is a more computer science-oriented method, but essentially, it's a way to compute large exponents efficiently.\n\nIn this case, we're computing \\( 2^5 \\), which is straightforward:\n\n\\[ 2^5 = 32 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by the initial amount: 10 \u00d7 32 = 320\n\n**Ranking the Solutions:**\n\n1. **Exponential Growth Formula:** This is the most direct and accurate method for exponential growth problems. It correctly applies the concept of doubling time and exponentiation.\n\n2. **Repeated Multiplication:** This method is simple and straightforward, especially for small numbers of time periods. It arrives at the correct answer but is less efficient for larger time periods.\n\n3. **Differential Equation Approach:** This method is more advanced and involves calculus, but it confirms the result obtained from the exponential growth formula.\n\n4. **Natural Logarithm and Continuous Growth Formula:** This method also arrives at the correct answer and provides insight into the relationship between discrete doubling and continuous growth.\n\n5. **Proportional Reasoning:** Similar to repeated multiplication, this method is straightforward and confirms the result.\n\n6. **Binary Exponentiation:** This is a efficient computational method, suitable for programming scenarios, and confirms the result.\n\n7. **Graphical Approach:** This method provides a visual understanding of the growth but is less precise for finding exact numerical values without precise plotting.\n\n8. **Sum of Geometric Series:** This method was misapplied in this context, as we were not summing the bacteria over time but looking for the value at a specific time point. Therefore, it led to an incorrect result and is not suitable for this problem.\n\n9. **Logarithmic Approach:** While logarithms are useful for solving for time or growth rates, in this specific problem, it wasn't necessary and slightly convoluted for finding the number of bacteria at a given time.\n\n10. **Rule of 70:** This method isn't applicable here since the doubling time is already known and the Rule of 70 is used for estimating doubling time based on a growth rate.\n\n**Best Solution:**\n\nThe best solution is the **Exponential Growth Formula**, as it is the most direct, accurate, and efficient method for this type of problem. It correctly models the exponential growth with a known doubling time and easily scales for any time period.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{320} \\]"
