        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the garden has an area of 180 square meters and a width of 9 meters. I need to find out the length of the garden and then figure out what the perimeter would be if I were to add a fence around it.\n\nAlright, first things first. I know that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, if I have the area and the width, I should be able to find the length by dividing the area by the width. Let me write that down.\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n\nSo,\n\nLength = Area / width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nLength = 180 m\u00b2 / 9 m = 20 m\n\nOkay, so the length of the garden is 20 meters.\n\nNext, I need to find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is the total distance around the edge. I remember that the formula for perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nSo, plugging in the values I have:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (20 m + 9 m) = 2 \u00d7 29 m = 58 m\n\nTherefore, the perimeter is 58 meters.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the area:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n\n180 m\u00b2 = 20 m \u00d7 9 m\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nNow, for the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width) = 2 \u00d7 (20 m + 9 m) = 2 \u00d7 29 m = 58 m\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach it differently. If I know the area and the width, and I've found the length, maybe I can use another method to verify the perimeter.\n\nLet me think. Maybe using the Pythagorean theorem or something, but that seems unnecessary for a rectangle. Or perhaps I can think about the properties of rectangles again.\n\nIn a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so there are two sides of length 20 meters and two sides of width 9 meters. So, the total perimeter would be:\n\n2 \u00d7 length + 2 \u00d7 width = 2 \u00d7 20 m + 2 \u00d7 9 m = 40 m + 18 m = 58 m\n\nSame answer as before. Okay, that gives me confidence that my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to visualize the garden, it's a rectangle with one side being 20 meters and the other being 9 meters. Adding a fence around it would mean fencing all four sides: two lengths and two widths, which again totals to 58 meters.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. But maybe there's another way to look at it. For example, sometimes problems might have additional constraints or require considering the shape in a different way, but in this case, it seems pretty straightforward.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me try calculating the area again with the length I found:\n\nArea = 20 m \u00d7 9 m = 180 m\u00b2\n\nYes, matches the given area.\n\nAnd for perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (20 m + 9 m) = 2 \u00d7 29 m = 58 m\n\nNo mistakes there.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The length of the garden is 20 meters, and the perimeter is 58 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe length of the garden is \\boxed{20} meters, and the perimeter is \\boxed{58} meters."
