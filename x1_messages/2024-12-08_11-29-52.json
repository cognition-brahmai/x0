        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 3x + 7 = 22. I need to find out what x is. Okay, let's start step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to isolate x on one side of the equation. To do that, I should get rid of the +7 on the left side. How can I do that? Well, I can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation. That way, the +7 and -7 will cancel each other out on the left side.\n\nSo, subtracting 7 from both sides:\n\n3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3x = 15\n\nOkay, now I have 3x = 15. I need to get x by itself. Since 3 is multiplied by x, I should do the opposite operation, which is division, to both sides.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 = 15 / 3\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx = 5\n\nAlright, so x equals 5. But let me check if that's correct. I'll plug x = 5 back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 7 = 22\n\nPlugging in x = 5: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22\n\nYes, it checks out. So, x = 5 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]\n"
