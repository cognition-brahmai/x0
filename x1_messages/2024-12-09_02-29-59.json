        "content": "Ah, a riddle! I do enjoy a good puzzle. Let's see here: \"Two brothers we are, great burdens we bear. All day we are bitterly pressed. Yet this I will say, we are full all the day, and empty when go to rest.\"\n\nHmm, two brothers carrying heavy loads, pressed all day, full when active, empty when resting. Brothers could mean they are related or similar in some way. Burdens and being pressed suggest they carry weight or have responsibilities.\n\nMaybe they're objects that hold something and are emptied at the end of the day. Like containers perhaps? But brothers imply they are similar yet distinct.\n\nLet me think about things that are used all day, carry something, and are emptied when not in use.\n\nWell, trash cans come to mind. They collect waste all day and are emptied at the end of the day. But are they brothers? Maybe if they are a pair, like in a household.\n\nBut the riddle says \"two brothers,\" so perhaps something more personal.\n\nWait, maybe shoes. Shoes carry us all day, bear the burden of our weight, and are empty when we take them off to rest.\n\nBut shoes are usually worn in pairs, so they could be considered brothers. They bear the pressure of walking and standing all day, and when we go to rest, we take them off, so they're empty.\n\nAlso, shoes are full when we wear them, containing our feet.\n\nThat seems to fit pretty well.\n\nAlternatively, another option could be lungs. We breathe all day, lungs are full of air, and when we rest, perhaps they're empty, but that doesn't make much sense because even at rest, lungs still have air.\n\nOr maybe pockets. Pockets carry our belongings all day, full of keys, coins, etc., and when we go to rest, we empty them into a dish or something similar.\n\nBut shoes seem more fitting because they are physically connected to us and bear our weight all day.\n\nLet me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nPerhaps bags or backpacks, which carry books or work materials all day, and are emptied when we get home.\n\nBut again, shoes seem more universal and directly related to bearing the burden of our weight.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps they are hands or arms, which carry loads all day and are \"empty\" when resting.\n\nBut hands aren't brothers in the same way shoes are paired.\n\nWait, what about gloves? Gloves are worn on hands, bear the burden of work, are full when worn, and empty when taken off.\n\nThat's similar to shoes, but shoes seem more apt because they are always present when we're moving around.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe it's not physical objects, but concepts.\n\nLike thoughts or emotions. But that seems too abstract for this riddle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's something in nature, like rivers or something that flows all day and rests at night.\n\nBut that doesn't fit the brother aspect or the burden bearing as well.\n\nI think shoes are still the best fit.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\n- Two brothers: left and right shoe.\n\n- Great burdens we bear: carry our weight all day.\n\n- All day we are bitterly pressed: feet press into them.\n\n- Full all day: contain our feet.\n\n- Empty when go to rest: taken off at rest.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's baskets or containers used in farming or daily life, carried all day and emptied at night.\n\nBut again, shoes are more universally relatable.\n\nI think shoes are the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{shoes}} \\]"
