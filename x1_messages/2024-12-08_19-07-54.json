        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 100 cars, and they rent each car for an average of 15 days per month at a rate of $50 per day. I need to find out their monthly revenue from renting all the cars.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how much revenue they get from one car in a month. If they rent each car for 15 days at $50 per day, then the revenue per car would be 15 days times $50 per day. So, that's 15 * 50.\n\nLet me calculate that: 15 * 50 = 750. So, each car brings in $750 per month.\n\nNow, since there are 100 cars, the total monthly revenue would be the revenue from one car multiplied by the number of cars. So, that's 750 * 100.\n\nCalculating that: 750 * 100 = 75,000.\n\nTherefore, the monthly revenue from renting all the cars is $75,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, revenue per car: 15 days * $50/day = $750. That seems correct.\n\nThen, total revenue: $750 per car * 100 cars = $75,000. Yeah, that looks right.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Are there any additional costs or variables that might affect the revenue? The question asks for monthly revenue from renting all the cars, so I think just the income from rentals is what's being asked for.\n\nOkay, so I think $75,000 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75000} \\]"
