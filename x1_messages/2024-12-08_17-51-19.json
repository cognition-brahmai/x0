        "content": "Let's see. If you read 20 pages every day, and you want to know how many pages you'll have read after 2 weeks, I need to figure out how many days are in 2 weeks first.\n\nI know that one week has 7 days, so 2 weeks would have 2 times 7, which is 14 days.\n\nNow, if you read 20 pages each day for 14 days, I can find the total number of pages by multiplying the number of pages per day by the number of days.\n\nSo, that's 20 pages/day times 14 days.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 20 times 14.\n\nWell, 20 times 10 is 200, and 20 times 4 is 80. So, 200 plus 80 is 280.\n\nTherefore, you would have read 280 pages after 2 weeks.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as reading 20 pages daily for two weeks.\n\nFirst, consider one week: 20 pages/day times 7 days equals 140 pages.\n\nThen, for two weeks, it would be 140 pages per week times 2, which is also 280 pages.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way could be to consider that 2 weeks have 14 days, and if you read 20 pages each day, it's simply 20 multiplied by 14, which is 280.\n\nI think no matter how I approach it, the answer remains the same.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use addition.\n\nIf you read 20 pages every day for 14 days, adding 20 fourteen times:\n\n20 + 20 = 40\n\n40 + 20 = 60\n\n60 + 20 = 80\n\n80 + 20 = 100\n\n100 + 20 = 120\n\n120 + 20 = 140\n\n140 + 20 = 160\n\n160 + 20 = 180\n\n180 + 20 = 200\n\n200 + 20 = 220\n\n220 + 20 = 240\n\n240 + 20 = 260\n\n260 + 20 = 280\n\nAgain, 280 pages.\n\nThis reinforces that the total is indeed 280 pages.\n\nI could also consider the unit method.\n\nPages per day: 20\n\nNumber of days: 14\n\nTotal pages = pages per day \u00d7 number of days = 20 \u00d7 14 = 280\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to break it down further:\n\n20 \u00d7 14 = 20 \u00d7 (10 + 4) = (20 \u00d7 10) + (20 \u00d7 4) = 200 + 80 = 280\n\nOr even:\n\n20 \u00d7 14 = (20 \u00d7 2) \u00d7 7 = 40 \u00d7 7 = 280\n\nRegardless of the method, the total comes out to be 280 pages.\n\nI think it's clear that after 2 weeks of reading 20 pages per day, you would have read 280 pages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{280} \\]"
