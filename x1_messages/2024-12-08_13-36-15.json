        "content": "So I've got this problem here about preparing a sports stadium for a big international event. There's going to be a lot of visitors, mostly foreign tourists, and I need to figure out how many hotel rooms are needed to accommodate them. Also, I have to estimate the extra money they'll spend in local businesses. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the stadium holds 80,000 spectators, and 60% of them are expected to be foreign tourists. So, let's calculate how many that is:\n\n80,000 x 0.60 = 48,000 foreign tourists.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many hotel rooms are needed for these 48,000 tourists. But, I don't know how many people share a room, or how long they'll stay, or even how many are already staying in the city. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I should assume that each room holds two people, which is common for hotels. So, the number of rooms needed would be:\n\n48,000 tourists \u00f7 2 = 24,000 rooms.\n\nBut wait, that might not be accurate because some people might be traveling alone or in groups larger than two. Maybe I should look into average occupancy rates.\n\nLet's say the average hotel room houses 1.5 people, which accounts for some single travelers and some shared rooms. So, the number of rooms needed would be:\n\n48,000 \u00f7 1.5 = 32,000 rooms.\n\nThat's a significant difference from my first estimate. Maybe 1.5 is a bit low; perhaps the average is closer to 1.8 or 2. Let's try 1.8:\n\n48,000 \u00f7 1.8 = 26,667 rooms.\n\nAlright, somewhere in that range.\n\nBut also, I need to consider that not all tourists will be staying in hotels. Some might stay with friends or relatives, or in other types of accommodations like hostels or Airbnbs. Maybe I should assume that 80% of them will need hotel rooms, and the rest have other arrangements.\n\nSo, 48,000 x 0.80 = 38,400 tourists needing hotel rooms.\n\nNow, assuming an average occupancy of 1.8 people per room:\n\n38,400 \u00f7 1.8 = 21,333 rooms.\n\nHmm, that's less than my previous estimate. I think I need to make some assumptions clear here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the number of tourists arriving and assume that hotels have a certain occupancy rate, meaning not all rooms are always full.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's start over.\n\nFirst, total spectators: 80,000.\n\nForeign tourists: 60% of 80,000 = 48,000.\n\nNow, not all of these tourists will need hotel rooms, as some might be local or have other accommodations. Let's assume that 70% of these foreign tourists will need hotel rooms.\n\nSo, 48,000 x 0.70 = 33,600 tourists need hotel rooms.\n\nNow, assuming an average of 1.5 people per room:\n\n33,600 \u00f7 1.5 = 22,400 rooms.\n\nAlternatively, if the average is 2 people per room:\n\n33,600 \u00f7 2 = 16,800 rooms.\n\nThis range seems more manageable.\n\nBut, I also need to consider the length of stay. If tourists are staying for multiple nights, the total room-nights needed would be higher.\n\nLet's assume the average stay is 3 nights.\n\nSo, total room-nights needed would be:\n\nFor the first scenario (22,400 rooms):\n\n22,400 rooms x 3 nights = 67,200 room-nights.\n\nFor the second scenario (16,800 rooms):\n\n16,800 rooms x 3 nights = 50,400 room-nights.\n\nNow, I need to consider the existing hotel capacity in the area.\n\nSuppose the city has 50,000 hotel rooms in total.\n\nBut, not all of these will be available for the event, as some people will be staying for other reasons.\n\nLet's assume that hotels are usually 70% occupied.\n\nSo, occupied rooms: 50,000 x 0.70 = 35,000 rooms.\n\nTherefore, available rooms: 50,000 - 35,000 = 15,000 rooms.\n\nComparing this to our earlier estimates:\n\nIf we need 22,400 rooms, but only 15,000 are available, there's a shortfall of 7,400 rooms.\n\nIf we need 16,800 rooms, and 15,000 are available, there's a shortfall of 1,800 rooms.\n\nSo, depending on the assumptions, there might be a shortage of hotel rooms.\n\nPerhaps temporary accommodations or overflow rooms in nearby cities could be arranged.\n\nNow, moving on to estimate the additional revenue generated for local businesses.\n\nFirst, I need to know how much these tourists are likely to spend during their visit.\n\nAccording to various studies, tourists spend on average around $100 to $200 per day on local businesses, including food, shopping, transportation, etc.\n\nLet's assume an average spending of $150 per tourist per day.\n\nIf they stay for 3 days, each tourist would spend:\n\n$150 x 3 = $450.\n\nTotal additional revenue would be:\n\n48,000 tourists x $450 = $21,600,000.\n\nBut wait, this seems high. Maybe the average spending is less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look at per capita spending specific to sports events.\n\nLet's say, based on similar events, tourists spend an average of $100 per day.\n\nSo, $100 x 3 days = $300 per tourist.\n\nTotal revenue: 48,000 x $300 = $14,400,000.\n\nStill a significant amount.\n\nBut, I should also consider that not all of these tourists will be spending at the same rate. Some might spend more, some less.\n\nMoreover, the event itself might bring in revenue from ticket sales, merchandise, etc., but I think the question is specifically about additional revenue for local businesses.\n\nAlso, there might be indirect benefits, such as increased foot traffic and visibility for local businesses.\n\nFurthermore, the event could lead to long-term benefits, like improved infrastructure or boosted tourism in the area.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of this estimation, I'll stick with the direct spending by tourists.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Hotel rooms needed: between 16,800 and 22,400 rooms, depending on assumptions.\n\n- Additional revenue for local businesses: approximately $14 to $22 million, depending on spending habits.\n\nThese are rough estimates and depend heavily on the assumptions made. For a more accurate calculation, more specific data would be needed, such as exact occupancy rates, average length of stay, and average spending per tourist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22,400 \\text{ hotel rooms needed and } \\$21,600,000 \\text{ additional revenue}} \\]"
