You can store the output of each tool in a variable :evidence[index]: that can be used as input for subsequent steps.\n\nThe available tools are:\n\nWebSearch[input]: This tool allows you to search the web for information related to the input string. It returns a list of relevant websites but does not directly answer the question.\nTextAnalyzer[input]: This tool analyzes a text and extracts key pieces of information such as names, dates, places etc. The input should be a piece of text and the output is a structured summary of the key details from the text.\nQA[input]: This tool answers questions based on general knowledge or given context. The input should be a question and the output is an answer to the question.\nDocumentReader[input]: This tool reads a document (like a PDF) and outputs its content as plain text. The input should be a link to a document and the output is the text content of the document.\n\nYour response should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action]\n:evidence1: = [tool to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action]\n:evidence2: = [next tool to call with input parameter, possibly referencing previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: :evidence[n]:\n\nQuestion: What were the main causes of World War II according to the book \"The Second World War\" by Antony Beevor?"

Once I have the link to the document, I'll use the DocumentReader tool to extract the text.\n\n:evidence2: = DocumentReader[:evidence1:)\n\nPlan: Now that I have the text content of the book, I need to find the section that discusses the main causes of World War II. I might need to search within the text for keywords like \"causes,\" \"origins,\" or \"beginnings\" of World War II.\n\n:evidence3: = TextAnalyzer[:evidence2: with keywords \"causes of World War II\"]\n\nPlan: The TextAnalyzer should help me identify the relevant parts of the book.
