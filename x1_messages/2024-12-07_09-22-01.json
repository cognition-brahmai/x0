        "content": "The city in Italy known for its leaning tower is Pisa. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most famous landmarks in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage site as part of the Piazza del Duomo complex. The tower began to lean during its construction in the 12th century due to soft ground under one side, which could not support the structure's weight. Over the centuries, the lean worsened, and numerous efforts have been made to stabilize it and prevent collapse. Today, the tower remains open to visitors, who can climb to the top and enjoy panoramic views of Pisa and its surroundings."
