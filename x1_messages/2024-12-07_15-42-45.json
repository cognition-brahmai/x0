        "content": "So, I have this question here: If a human body has about 5 liters of blood and can lose up to 15% before it becomes life-threatening, how much blood in milliliters can a person lose safely? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like I have to find out how much blood a person can lose without it being life-threatening. They've given me the total blood volume and the percentage that can be lost safely.\n\nSo, the total blood volume is 5 liters, and the safe loss is up to 15% of that. I need to find out what 15% of 5 liters is, and since the question asks for the answer in milliliters, I'll need to convert liters to milliliters.\n\nFirst, let's recall that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. So, 5 liters would be:\n\n5 liters * 1000 milliliters/liter = 5000 milliliters\n\nNow, I need to find 15% of 5000 milliliters.\n\nTo find a percentage of a number, I can use the formula:\n\n(percentage / 100) * total amount\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n(15 / 100) * 5000 milliliters\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n15 divided by 100 is 0.15\n\nThen, 0.15 multiplied by 5000 is:\n\n0.15 * 5000 = 750 milliliters\n\nTherefore, a person can lose up to 750 milliliters of blood safely before it becomes life-threatening.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 5 liters, which is indeed 5000 milliliters.\n\nThen, 15% of 5000 milliliters:\n\n15% = 0.15\n\n0.15 * 5000 = 750 milliliters\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the percentage is exactly 15% or if there's any rounding involved. But since the question says \"up to 15%\", I think 15% is the exact threshold.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the conversion from liters to milliliters is accurate. Yes, 1 liter equals 1000 milliliters, so 5 liters is 5000 milliliters.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate 15% of 5 liters and then convert that to milliliters.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n15% of 5 liters is:\n\n(15/100) * 5 = 0.15 * 5 = 0.75 liters\n\nThen, convert 0.75 liters to milliliters:\n\n0.75 liters * 1000 milliliters/liter = 750 milliliters\n\nSame answer as before. So, that reinforces that 750 milliliters is the correct amount of blood that can be safely lost.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation, like the rate of blood loss or the person's overall health. But based on the information given, it seems like the only relevant factors are the total blood volume and the percentage that can be lost safely.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 750 milliliters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{750} \\]"
