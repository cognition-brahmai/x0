        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we know that the town has a total population of 12,000 people. Out of these, 60% are adults. So, to find out how many adults there are, I need to calculate 60% of 12,000.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n60% of 12,000 = (60/100) * 12,000 = 0.6 * 12,000 = 7,200 adults.\n\nSo, there are 7,200 adults in the town.\n\nNow, out of these adults, 30% have at least one child. I need to find out how many adults have at least one child and then subtract that number from the total number of adults to find out how many adults do not have any children.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many adults have at least one child:\n\n30% of 7,200 = (30/100) * 7,200 = 0.3 * 7,200 = 2,160 adults.\n\nSo, 2,160 adults have at least one child.\n\nNow, to find out how many adults do not have any children, I'll subtract the number of adults who have children from the total number of adults:\n\n7,200 - 2,160 = 5,040 adults.\n\nTherefore, 5,040 adults do not have any children.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total adults: 60% of 12,000.\n\n60% of 12,000: (60/100)*12,000 = 7,200. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 30% of these adults have at least one child: 30% of 7,200.\n\n30% of 7,200: (30/100)*7,200 = 2,160. That seems right.\n\nFinally, adults without children: total adults minus adults with children: 7,200 - 2,160 = 5,040.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the answer should be 5,040 adults do not have any children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5040} \\]"
