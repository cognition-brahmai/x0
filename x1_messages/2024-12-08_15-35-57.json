        "content": "I'm trying to figure out which country in the Horn of Africa uses something called Ge'ez script. First, I need to know what the Horn of Africa is. I think it's a region in Northeast Africa that includes countries like Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia. So, one of these countries probably uses Ge'ez script.\n\nNow, what is Ge'ez script? I'm not entirely sure, but I recall that it's an ancient writing system. I think it's associated with Ethiopia or Eritrea because those countries have historical ties and share some cultural elements. Maybe both countries use it?\n\nLet me see. Ethiopia comes to mind immediately. I've heard that Amharic, which is the official language of Ethiopia, is written in Ge'ez script. But is Ge'ez the same as Amharic? I think Ge'ez is the older script, and it's used for religious texts in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Amharic, on the other hand, is the modern language used in everyday communication.\n\nWait, maybe Ge'ez script is used in Eritrea as well since Eritrea was part of Ethiopia until it gained independence in 1993. So, it's possible that both countries use Ge'ez script for their official languages.\n\nLet me check what the official languages of these countries are. In Ethiopia, Amharic is the official language, and in Eritrea, it's Arabic and Tigrinya, I think. But I'm not sure about Eritrea's official languages.\n\nHmm, maybe Ge'ez script is used in Tigrinya as well. I recall that Tigrinya is also written in Ge'ez script. So, perhaps both Ethiopia and Eritrea use Ge'ez script for their official languages.\n\nBut the question is asking for a unique writing system. Is Ge'ez script unique to one country? Or is it shared between Ethiopia and Eritrea?\n\nI need to find out if Ge'ez script is exclusively used in one country or if it's used in multiple countries in the Horn of Africa.\n\nLet me think about the distribution of Ge'ez script. I know that Ge'ez is an ancient South Semitic language that was spoken in what is now Ethiopia and Eritrea. The script is used not only for Ge'ez but also for other languages in the region, including Amharic, Tigrinya, and Tigre.\n\nGiven that, it seems that Ge'ez script is used in multiple languages across Ethiopia and Eritrea. So, is there a country that uniquely has this writing system?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a country that still primarily uses Ge'ez script in the modern era.\n\nWait, but both Ethiopia and Eritrea use Ge'ez script for their official languages. In Ethiopia, Amharic is written in Ge'ez script, and in Eritrea, Tigrinya is also written in Ge'ez script.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is Ethiopia, as it is a larger country and has a longer history of using Ge'ez script.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to Eritrea, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's Djibouti. But I don't think Djibouti uses Ge'ez script. I think Djibouti's official language is French and Arabic, and they use Latin and Arabic scripts.\n\nSo, probably not Djibouti.\n\nThen there's Somalia. I believe Somali is written in Latin script, so not Ge'ez.\n\nSo, between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which one should I choose?\n\nMaybe the question is expecting Ethiopia as the answer because it has a stronger association with Ge'ez script due to its historical and religious significance in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.\n\nAlso, Ge'ez is considered the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which is the dominant religion in Ethiopia.\n\nOn the other hand, Eritrea has its own Orthodox Church, and Tigrinya, which is spoken in Eritrea, also uses Ge'ez script.\n\nBut perhaps the question is focusing on a country where Ge'ez script is most prominently used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to a country where Ge'ez script is the official script.\n\nI need to recall which country officially uses Ge'ez script for its language.\n\nWait, actually, in Ethiopia, Amharic is the official language, and it's written in Ge'ez script. In Eritrea, Tigrinya and Arabic are official languages, and Tigrinya is written in Ge'ez script, while Arabic is written in Arabic script.\n\nSo, both countries use Ge'ez script, but perhaps Ethiopia is more associated with it because of its historical use in the Ethiopian Empire, which covered a larger area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a country where Ge'ez script is unique, meaning it's not used elsewhere.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because Ge'ez script is used in multiple languages in the region.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about a country that has adopted Ge'ez script as its unique writing system, differentiating it from neighboring countries that use other scripts like Arabic or Latin.\n\nIn that case, both Ethiopia and Eritrea have adopted Ge'ez script for their official languages, making it unique compared to neighboring countries like Djibouti and Somalia, which use Arabic and Latin scripts.\n\nBut I need to choose one country.\n\nMaybe the answer is Ethiopia.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's Eritrea, but I think Ethiopia is more strongly associated with Ge'ez script.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nEthiopia:\n\n- Official language: Amharic, written in Ge'ez script.\n\n- Other languages like Oromo, Tigrinya also use Ge'ez script.\n\nEritrea:\n\n- Official languages: Arabic and Tigrinya, with Tigrinya written in Ge'ez script.\n\n- Other languages like Tigre also use Ge'ez script.\n\nDjibouti:\n\n- Official languages: French and Arabic, using Latin and Arabic scripts.\n\nSomalia:\n\n- Official language: Somali, written in Latin script.\n\nSo, both Ethiopia and Eritrea use Ge'ez script, but Ethiopia has a longer history and\u66f4\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u7684 use of it.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is Ethiopia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Ethiopia}} \\]"
