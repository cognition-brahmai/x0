        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and we're told that 12 play soccer, 15 play basketball, and 8 play both sports. We need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to find those who don't play any sport.\n\nSo, 12 students play soccer and 15 play basketball. If I add those together, that's 12 + 15 = 27 students playing at least one sport. But wait, that can't be right because some students play both sports.\n\nAh, yes! The 8 students who play both soccer and basketball are being counted twice in that addition, once for soccer and once for basketball. So, to avoid double-counting, I need to subtract those 8 students from the total.\n\nSo, it should be 12 + 15 - 8 = 19 students who play at least one sport.\n\nNow, if there are 30 students in total, and 19 play at least one sport, then the number of students who don't play either sport should be 30 - 19 = 11.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother method I can think of is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle. According to this principle, to find the number of students who play at least one sport, I should add the number of soccer players and the number of basketball players, and then subtract the number of students who play both sports.\n\nSo, it's |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|, where A is the set of soccer players, and B is the set of basketball players.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: |A \u222a B| = 12 + 15 - 8 = 19, just like before.\n\nThen, the number of students who don't play either sport is the total number of students minus those who play at least one sport: 30 - 19 = 11.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But maybe I can visualize this with a Venn diagram to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLet's imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\nThe overlap, or the intersection of the two circles, represents students who play both sports. We're told that's 8 students.\n\nSo, in the soccer circle, there are 12 students in total, but 8 of them also play basketball. That means there are 12 - 8 = 4 students who play only soccer.\n\nSimilarly, in the basketball circle, there are 15 students in total, but 8 of them also play soccer. So, there are 15 - 8 = 7 students who play only basketball.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students who play at least one sport, I add those who play only soccer, only basketball, and both: 4 + 7 + 8 = 19.\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nFinally, subtracting that from the total number of students: 30 - 19 = 11 students who don't play either sport.\n\nI think that's the answer, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs it possible that some students play other sports not mentioned here? The question only talks about soccer and basketball, so I think we can assume that all sports played by the students are either soccer, basketball, or neither.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that 12 play soccer, 15 play basketball, and 8 play both. There doesn't seem to be any information about students playing other combinations of sports, so I think our earlier approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for the number of students who don't play any sport, which would be: total students - (soccer players + basketball players - both).\n\nAgain, plugging in the numbers: 30 - (12 + 15 - 8) = 30 - 19 = 11.\n\nConsistently getting 11 as the answer gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nJust to explore further, suppose I make a table to represent the students:\n\n- Only soccer: 4 students\n\n- Only basketball: 7 students\n\n- Both soccer and basketball: 8 students\n\n- Neither sport: ?\n\nAdding up the first three categories: 4 + 7 + 8 = 19.\n\nTotal students are 30, so neither sport: 30 - 19 = 11.\n\nSame result again.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that 11 students do not play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
