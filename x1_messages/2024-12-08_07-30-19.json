        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a train traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. It takes 30 minutes to travel between two stations, and then another 45 minutes to reach its final destination after leaving the second station. I need to find out how far apart the first and final stations are.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how far the train travels in those 30 minutes between the first and second stations. Since speed is 60 mph, and time is 30 minutes, I need to convert the time into hours because the speed is in miles per hour.\n\n30 minutes is half an hour, so time t1 = 0.5 hours.\n\nDistance d1 = speed \u00d7 time = 60 mph \u00d7 0.5 hours = 30 miles.\n\nOkay, so the first two stations are 30 miles apart.\n\nNext, after leaving the second station, it takes another 45 minutes to reach the final destination. Again, I need to convert 45 minutes into hours.\n\n45 minutes is 0.75 hours, so time t2 = 0.75 hours.\n\nDistance d2 = speed \u00d7 time = 60 mph \u00d7 0.75 hours = 45 miles.\n\nSo, the distance between the second station and the final destination is 45 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance between the first and final stations, I should add the two distances together.\n\nTotal distance = d1 + d2 = 30 miles + 45 miles = 75 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me see: constant speed of 60 mph, 30 minutes to travel from first to second station: time is 0.5 hours, distance is 60 \u00d7 0.5 = 30 miles.\n\nThen, another 45 minutes to the final destination: time is 0.75 hours, distance is 60 \u00d7 0.75 = 45 miles.\n\nAdding them up gives 75 miles.\n\nHmm, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, is the train stopping at the second station, and does that affect the travel time? The question doesn't mention any stopping time, so I think it's safe to assume that the time between stations includes any stops.\n\nAlso, the speed is constant at 60 mph, so there are no changes in speed to account for.\n\nTherefore, the total distance between the first and final stations is 75 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
