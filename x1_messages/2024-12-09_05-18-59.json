        "content": "So there are 12 boys and 16 girls in the classroom, making a total of 28 students. We need to find the probability that when selecting 8 students at random, exactly 4 are boys and 4 are girls.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to calculate probabilities in combinations. Since the selection is random, each group of 8 students has an equal chance of being chosen. So, the probability will be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 8 students out of 28 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{28}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, we want exactly 4 boys and 4 girls. The number of ways to choose 4 boys out of 12 is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{4}\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose 4 girls out of 16 is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{16}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of favorable ways to choose 4 boys and 4 girls is the product of these two combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = \\binom{12}{4} \\times \\binom{16}{4}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\binom{12}{4} \\times \\binom{16}{4}}{\\binom{28}{8}}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate these combinations. Let's recall that the combination formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\binom{12}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{4} = \\frac{12!}{4! \\times 8!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 495\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( \\binom{16}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{16}{4} = \\frac{16!}{4! \\times 12!} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 1820\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( \\binom{28}{8} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{28}{8} = \\frac{28!}{8! \\times 20!} = \\frac{28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21}{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 3108105\n\\]\n\nNow, plug these values back into the probability formula:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{495 \\times 1820}{3108105}\n\\]\n\nFirst, multiply 495 by 1820:\n\n\\[\n495 \\times 1820 = 900900\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{900900}{3108105}\n\\]\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{900900 \\div 15}{3108105 \\div 15} = \\frac{60060}{207207}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify further by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60060 \\div 3}{207207 \\div 3} = \\frac{20020}{69069}\n\\]\n\nThis seems to be the simplest form. To get a decimal approximation, we can divide 20020 by 69069:\n\n\\[\nP \\approx 0.2898\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2898, or 28.98%.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave it as a fraction:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{20020}{69069}\n\\]\n\nBut perhaps we can check if this fraction can be simplified further. Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20020 and 69069.\n\nFirst, factorize both numbers:\n\n20020:\n\n\\[\n20020 = 20 \\times 1001 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\n\\]\n\n69069:\n\n\\[\n69069 = 69 \\times 1001 = 3 \\times 23 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\n\\]\n\nCommon factors are 7, 11, and 13.\n\nSo, GCD = 7 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13 = 1001\n\nNow, divide numerator and denominator by 1001:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20020 \\div 1001}{69069 \\div 1001} = \\frac{20}{69}\n\\]\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{20}{69} \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\( \\frac{20}{69} \\), which is approximately 0.2899 or 28.99%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{20}{69}} \\]"
