In a letter to his daughter, Sarah Bache, on January 26, 1784, Franklin expressed his disapproval of the eagle's representation on the Great Seal of the United States, suggesting that the wild turkey would have been a more appropriate choice. He believed the turkey was a more respectable bird and a true original native of America."
