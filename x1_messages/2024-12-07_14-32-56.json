        "content": "The ancient civilization that built the famous pyramids at Giza and the Sphinx was the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, specifically during the Fourth Dynasty around 2580-2560 BCE. The most well-known pyramids are the Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Pharaoh Khufu, also known as Cheops; the Pyramid of Khafre, built for his son; and the Pyramid of Menkaure, built for another pharaoh of the same dynasty. The Great Sphinx, with its human head and lion body, is located near these pyramids and is believed to have been constructed during the reign of Pharaoh Khafre.\n\nAncient Egyptians built these monumental structures as tombs for their pharaohs, who were considered divine rulers and were buried with grave goods to help them in the afterlife. The construction of the pyramids required a significant amount of labor and resources, and it is estimated that tens of thousands of workers were involved in their building over many years.\n\nThe pyramids and the Sphinx are not only architectural marvels but also important symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization and its belief in the afterlife. They continue to fascinate people around the world and are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World."
