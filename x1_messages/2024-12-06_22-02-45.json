        "content": "I think I've got this one. The film you're referring to is \"Groundhog Day.\" It stars Bill Murray as a weatherman who finds himself stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. The movie shares its name with the real-life Groundhog Day, which is an annual holiday celebrated on February 2nd in the United States.\n\nIn the film, Murray's character, Phil Connors, is covering the Groundhog Day events in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, when he gets caught in this time loop. Each day begins exactly the same, and he has to find a way to break free from this cycle. It's a unique premise that explores themes of morality, personal growth, and the meaning of life.\n\n\"Groundhog Day\" was released in 1993 and has since become a cult classic, known not only for its innovative storyline but also for Bill Murray's outstanding performance. The movie has had a lasting impact on popular culture, and the term \"groundhog day\" is often used to describe any situation that repeats itself endlessly.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the film you're thinking of is indeed \"Groundhog Day,\" a 1993 comedy with dramatic elements, directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, among others. It's a brilliant movie that continues to resonate with audiences today."
