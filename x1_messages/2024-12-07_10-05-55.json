I'm Tony Stark, and today, I'm thrilled to unveil a groundbreaking invention that promises to reshape our world in ways we've only dared to dream.\n\nYou all know me for my suits, my quips, and maybe even my occasional misadventures. But at my core, I'm an inventor. A problem-solver. And today, I'm here to share with you something that could be a game-changer for humanity.\n\nIntroducing the Arc Reactor 2.0 \u2013 a quantum leap in clean energy technology. For years, we've been reliant on fossil fuels, causing irreparable damage to our planet. But no more. This isn't just another green initiative; it's a revolution.\n\nThe Arc Reactor 2.0 harnesses the power of arc energy, producing unlimited, clean power with zero emissions. It's safe, efficient, and scalable \u2013 from powering a single home to entire cities. Imagine a world where energy is abundant and free, where pollution is a thing of the past. With this technology, that world is within our grasp.\n\nBut I'm not stopping there. We're also integrating artificial intelligence to manage and optimize energy distribution, ensuring that every corner of the globe has access to this life-changing power.\n\nNow, I know what some of you might be thinking: \"Another tech billionaire promising to save the world.\" Well, let me assure you, this is different. This is not about making more money or gaining more power. It's about using the resources I have to make a real, tangible difference.\n\nWe're going to open-source the technology, making it accessible to everyone. No patents, no royalties. Because when it comes to saving the planet, we can't afford to play games.\n\nOf course, there are challenges ahead. Implementing such a radical shift won't be easy. But I believe in human ingenuity and our ability to come together for a common goal.\n\nI'm committing a significant portion of my resources to this project, but I can't do it alone. I need governments, corporations, and individuals to join me in this mission. Let's work together to make this a reality.\n\nIn conclusion, today marks the beginning of a new era \u2013 one where energy is clean, abundant, and available to all. The Arc Reactor 2.0 is more than just a technological breakthrough; it's a beacon of hope for a sustainable future.\n\nThank you.\n\n**[Applause]**"
