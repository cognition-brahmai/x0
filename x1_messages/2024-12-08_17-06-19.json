        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're given that the ratio of cars to motorcycles in a city is 5:3, and there are 12,000 more cars than motorcycles. We need to find the total number of vehicles in the city.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 5:3 means that for every 5 cars, there are 3 motorcycles. It's like dividing the vehicles into parts where cars take 5 parts and motorcycles take 3 parts.\n\nLet's denote the number of cars as C and the number of motorcycles as M. According to the ratio, C/M = 5/3.\n\nBut we also know that there are 12,000 more cars than motorcycles, so C = M + 12,000.\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for C into the ratio equation.\n\nSo, (M + 12,000)/M = 5/3.\n\nNow, let's solve for M.\n\nMultiply both sides by M to get rid of the denominator:\n\nM + 12,000 = (5/3)M.\n\nNow, let's get all terms involving M on one side:\n\nM + 12,000 - M = (5/3)M - M.\n\n12,000 = (5/3)M - (3/3)M.\n\n12,000 = (2/3)M.\n\nNow, to find M, multiply both sides by 3/2:\n\nM = 12,000 * (3/2).\n\nM = 18,000.\n\nSo, there are 18,000 motorcycles.\n\nNow, since C = M + 12,000, then C = 18,000 + 12,000 = 30,000.\n\nTherefore, the total number of vehicles is C + M = 30,000 + 18,000 = 48,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nGiven the ratio 5:3, and the difference is 12,000, which corresponds to 2 parts in the ratio (5 - 3 = 2 parts).\n\nSo, 2 parts = 12,000.\n\nTherefore, 1 part = 12,000 / 2 = 6,000.\n\nThen, total vehicles are 5 + 3 = 8 parts.\n\nSo, 8 parts * 6,000 = 48,000.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we could have set up equations using the ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s say each part is X.\n\nSo, cars = 5X, motorcycles = 3X.\n\nGiven that cars are 12,000 more than motorcycles:\n\n5X - 3X = 12,000.\n\n2X = 12,000.\n\nX = 6,000.\n\nTherefore, cars = 5 * 6,000 = 30,000.\n\nMotorcycles = 3 * 6,000 = 18,000.\n\nTotal vehicles = 30,000 + 18,000 = 48,000.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the concept of proportions.\n\nThe ratio of cars to motorcycles is 5:3, which means cars are 5/3 times the number of motorcycles.\n\nGiven that cars are 12,000 more than motorcycles, we can set up the equation as before.\n\nBut I think I\u2019ve confirmed it enough ways. The total number of vehicles in the city is 48,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48000} \\]"
