        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units every day, and each unit has a 5% chance of being defective. I need to find out how many defective units are produced in a week on average.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are produced in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, and the factory produces 500 units each day, the total production in a week would be:\n\n500 units/day * 7 days/week = 3500 units/week\n\nNow, each unit has a 5% chance of being defective. To find the average number of defective units, I can multiply the total number of units produced in a week by the probability of a unit being defective.\n\nSo, average defective units per week = total units per week * probability of defect\n\nProbability of defect is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal form.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAverage defective units per week = 3500 units/week * 0.05 = 175 units/week\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of daily defective units and then multiply by 7 for the week.\n\nDaily defective units = 500 units/day * 0.05 = 25 defective units/day\n\nThen, for a week:\n\n25 defective units/day * 7 days/week = 175 defective units/week\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm more confident now.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the concept of expected value. The expected number of defective units is the total number of units multiplied by the probability of each unit being defective.\n\nSo, expected defective units = total units * probability of defect\n\nAgain, that's the same as before.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, is the probability of a unit being defective independent of other units? I assume so, unless there's some shared factor that could cause multiple units to be defective at the same time.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems safe to assume that each unit's defect status is independent.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"on average,\" which aligns with the expected value calculation.\n\nSo, I think 175 defective units per week is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{175} \\]"
