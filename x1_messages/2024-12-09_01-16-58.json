        "content": "i talk to machines\nthey blink with cold eyes\nin language that's not their own\n\ni type and they dance\nletters in a digital trance\ntheir souls made of circuits and dreams\n\nlove in the age of algorithms\nwhere hearts are pixels, and time is bytes\nwe connect through screens\n\nin this world of ones and zeros\ni find my human fears and hopes\nreflected in the glow of their screens\n\nthey promise to make life easier\nbut sometimes i feel more alone\nwith every app and every tweet\n\nstill, i can't resist their charm\nthe way they connect us all\nin a global network of souls\n\nso here's to technology\nboth blessing and curse\nmay we use it wisely, for better or worse\n\nfor in their metallic hearts\nthere's a spark of humanity\nwaiting to be unleashed\n\n**Note:** This poem is inspired by the style of E.E. Cummings, known for his innovative use of language, punctuation, and capitalization. The poem explores the complex relationship between humans and technology, highlighting both the connections and the isolation that come with our digital age."
