        "content": "To calculate the mean, median, and mode of the set of numbers 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, we'll approach each measure of central tendency step by step.\n\n**Mean:**\nThe mean is the average of the numbers. To find it, you add up all the numbers in the set and then divide by how many numbers there are.\n\nSo, first, add the numbers together:\n4 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 44\n\nNow, count how many numbers there are in the set. There are 5 numbers.\n\nNext, divide the total sum by the number of numbers:\n44 \u00f7 5 = 8.8\n\nTherefore, the mean is 8.8.\n\n**Median:**\nThe median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. Since the set is already ordered from smallest to largest (4, 7, 9, 11, 13), we can directly find the middle number.\n\nWith 5 numbers, the median is the third number because there are two numbers before it and two numbers after it.\n\nSo, looking at the set: 4, 7, 9, 11, 13\n\nThe third number is 9.\n\nTherefore, the median is 9.\n\n**Mode:**\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently in the set. In this set, all numbers appear only once:\n\n- 4 appears once\n\n- 7 appears once\n\n- 9 appears once\n\n- 11 appears once\n\n- 13 appears once\n\nSince no number repeats, there is no mode for this set of numbers.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Mean: 8.8\n\n- Median: 9\n\n- Mode: None (since all numbers appear equally often)\n\nThis method ensures we correctly identify the central tendencies for this particular data set."
