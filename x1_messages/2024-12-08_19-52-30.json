Each tree requires an initial investment of $50 for purchase and planting, as well as ongoing maintenance costs of $20 per year. Calculate the total cost of the project over the 10-year period, taking into account both initial investments and annual maintenance expenses."

        "content": "So the city wants to plant 1 million trees over 10 years, and each tree costs $50 to plant initially and then $20 per year to maintain. I need to figure out the total cost over those 10 years, including both the planting and the yearly maintenance.\n\nFirst, I should think about the planting costs. Since they're planting 1 million trees over 10 years, that's 1,000,000 trees * $50 each for planting. That sounds like a lot, but I need to calculate it accurately.\n\nSo, planting cost = 1,000,000 trees * $50/tree = $50,000,000.\n\nNow, for the maintenance costs. Each tree costs $20 per year to maintain. But since the trees are being planted over 10 years, not all trees will be in the ground for the full 10 years. The first year's trees will be maintained for 10 years, the second year's trees for 9 years, and so on, until the last year's trees, which will only be maintained for 1 year.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the total maintenance cost for all trees over their respective maintenance periods.\n\nLet me think about this. If they plant 100,000 trees each year (since 1,000,000 trees over 10 years), then:\n\n- Trees planted in year 1: 100,000 trees * $20/tree/year * 10 years\n\n- Trees planted in year 2: 100,000 trees * $20/tree/year * 9 years\n\n- ...\n\n- Trees planted in year 10: 100,000 trees * $20/tree/year * 1 year\n\nWait, but actually, if they plant 100,000 trees each year, then the total maintenance cost would be the sum of each year's planting multiplied by their respective maintenance years.\n\nLet me try to calculate that.\n\nFirst, for year 1 planting:\n\n100,000 trees * $20/tree/year * 10 years = $2,000,000 * 10 = $20,000,000\n\nYear 2:\n\n100,000 * 20 * 9 = $1,800,000 * 9 = $18,000,000\n\nYear 3: $1,800,000 * 8 = $14,400,000\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 100,000 trees * $20/year = $2,000,000 per year for that year's planting.\n\nSo, for year 1 planting:\n\n$2,000,000 per year * 10 years = $20,000,000\n\nYear 2: $2,000,000 per year * 9 years = $18,000,000\n\nYear 3: $2,000,000 per year * 8 years = $16,000,000\n\nYear 4: $2,000,000 * 7 = $14,000,000\n\nYear 5: $2,000,000 * 6 = $12,000,000\n\nYear 6: $2,000,000 * 5 = $10,000,000\n\nYear 7: $2,000,000 * 4 = $8,000,000\n\nYear 8: $2,000,000 * 3 = $6,000,000\n\nYear 9: $2,000,000 * 2 = $4,000,000\n\nYear 10: $2,000,000 * 1 = $2,000,000\n\nNow, I need to add all these maintenance costs together:\n\n$20,000,000 + $18,000,000 + $16,000,000 + $14,000,000 + $12,000,000 + $10,000,000 + $8,000,000 + $6,000,000 + $4,000,000 + $2,000,000\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n20 + 18 = 38\n\n38 + 16 = 54\n\n54 + 14 = 68\n\n68 + 12 = 80\n\n80 + 10 = 90\n\n90 + 8 = 98\n\n98 + 6 = 104\n\n104 + 4 = 108\n\n108 + 2 = 110\n\nSo, the total maintenance cost is $110,000,000.\n\nNow, adding the initial planting cost of $50,000,000 to the maintenance cost of $110,000,000 gives a total cost of $160,000,000 over 10 years.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, planting cost: 1,000,000 trees * $50/tree = $50,000,000. That seems correct.\n\nNow, maintenance: Each tree costs $20 per year, and they are planted over 10 years, with different lifespans for maintenance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to calculate the maintenance cost.\n\nAnother approach: Over 10 years, the total number of trees planted is 1,000,000, and each tree will be maintained for up to 10 years, but since they are planted each year, the average maintenance period per tree would be the average of 1 to 10 years.\n\nThe average of the numbers from 1 to 10 is (1+10)/2 = 5.5 years.\n\nSo, if each tree is maintained for an average of 5.5 years at $20 per year, then the total maintenance cost per tree is 5.5 * $20 = $110.\n\nThen, for 1,000,000 trees, the total maintenance cost would be 1,000,000 * $110 = $110,000,000.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, total cost = planting cost + maintenance cost = $50,000,000 + $110,000,000 = $160,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the project over 10 years is $160,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160000000} \\]"
