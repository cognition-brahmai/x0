        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, the national park is planning to build a new visitor center that's going to cost $12 million. They expect to make some money from this center in a couple of ways: first, there's an additional $1 million per year from entrance fees and merchandise sales due to increased visitation. Second, they're planning to charge a $5 admission fee specifically for the visitor center, and they expect 200,000 visitors to pay this fee each year.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how long it will take for the park to recover the $12 million construction cost from these revenue streams.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total annual revenue from the visitor center.\n\nThere are two sources of revenue:\n\n1. The additional $1 million per year from entrance fees and merchandise sales.\n\n2. The $5 admission fee for the visitor center, with 200,000 visitors per year.\n\nSo, the revenue from the admission fee would be $5 multiplied by 200,000 visitors, which is $1,000,000.\n\nWait, $5 times 200,000 is $1,000,000. So, that's another $1 million per year.\n\nTherefore, the total annual revenue from the visitor center is $1 million (from increased visitation) plus $1 million (from the admission fee), which totals $2 million per year.\n\nNow, to find out how long it will take to recover the $12 million construction cost, I need to divide the construction cost by the annual revenue.\n\nSo, $12 million divided by $2 million per year equals 6 years.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nConstruction cost: $12,000,000\n\nAnnual revenue from visitor center: $1,000,000 (from increased visitation) + $5 * 200,000 (admission fee)\n\nLet's calculate the admission fee revenue again.\n\n$5 per visitor * 200,000 visitors = $1,000,000\n\nSo, total annual revenue: $1,000,000 + $1,000,000 = $2,000,000\n\nNow, recovery period: $12,000,000 / $2,000,000 per year = 6 years\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other costs associated with running the visitor center, like operating costs or maintenance, but the problem doesn't mention any additional costs beyond the construction cost.\n\nSo, assuming that the only cost is the construction cost and the annual revenue is $2 million, then yes, it would take 6 years to recover the construction cost.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider the time value of money, like discounting future cash flows, but the problem doesn't specify any interest rates or discount rates, so probably it's okay to assume simple division of cost by annual revenue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $1 million from entrance fees and merchandise sales is already included in the admission fee revenue, but the problem says \"additional $1 million per year in entrance fees and merchandise sales from the increased visitation,\" separate from the $5 admission fee for the visitor center.\n\nSo, it seems like these are two distinct revenue streams:\n\n1. Additional $1 million per year from increased visitation.\n\n2. $5 admission fee for the visitor center, with 200,000 visitors per year, which is another $1 million per year.\n\nSo, total additional revenue per year is $2 million.\n\nTherefore, recovery period is 12 million / 2 million per year = 6 years.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nUnless there's something I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the admission fee is only for the visitor center, and the entrance fee is separate.\n\nBut the problem says \"additional $1 million per year in entrance fees and merchandise sales from the increased visitation.\"\n\nSo, it seems like the visitor center is attracting more visitors, who are paying the park's regular entrance fee and buying merchandise, generating an additional $1 million per year.\n\nPlus, on top of that, there's a separate $5 admission fee just for the visitor center.\n\nAssuming that these are two distinct revenues, then yes, total additional revenue is $2 million per year.\n\nTherefore, the construction cost will be recovered in 6 years.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ years}} \\]"
