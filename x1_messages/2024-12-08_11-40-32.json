        "content": "So the shipping company is thinking about buying a new cargo ship to grow their business. This ship can carry up to 100,000 tons of cargo, and it's expected to last for 25 years. The ship costs $75 million to buy, and it will cost $5 million per year to operate. They think they can make an average of $20 for every ton of cargo they ship. Now, they want to know the least amount of cargo they need to ship each year just to break even over the ship's lifetime. Breaking even means that their total revenues equal their total costs.\n\nAlright, to figure this out, we need to calculate the total costs over the 25 years and then see how much revenue they need to match that amount. Then, we can determine the minimum cargo volume required to generate that revenue.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total purchase and operating costs over the 25 years.\n\nThe purchase price is $75 million, and the annual operating cost is $5 million. So, over 25 years, the operating costs would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total operating costs} = \\$5 \\text{ million/year} \\times 25 \\text{ years} = \\$125 \\text{ million}\n\\]\n\nNow, add the purchase price to the total operating costs to get the total costs over 25 years:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total costs} = \\$75 \\text{ million} + \\$125 \\text{ million} = \\$200 \\text{ million}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much revenue they need to generate to cover these $200 million in costs. Since they expect to earn $20 per ton of cargo shipped, we can set up an equation to find the total cargo volume needed.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total cargo volume over 25 years as \\( V \\) tons. The total revenue \\( R \\) would be:\n\n\\[\nR = 20 \\times V\n\\]\n\nTo break even, the total revenue must equal the total costs:\n\n\\[\n20V = 200,000,000\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( V \\):\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{200,000,000}{20} = 10,000,000 \\text{ tons}\n\\]\n\nSo, the company needs to ship a total of 10 million tons over the 25-year period to break even.\n\nBut the question asks for the minimum annual cargo volume needed. To find the annual volume, we divide the total volume by the number of years:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Annual cargo volume} = \\frac{10,000,000 \\text{ tons}}{25 \\text{ years}} = 400,000 \\text{ tons/year}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the company needs to ship at least 400,000 tons of cargo each year to break even over the ship's operational life.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps considering the time value of money could affect the calculation, but since the problem doesn't mention discount rates or interest, maybe it's okay to ignore that for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ship isn't operating at full capacity every year, but the problem asks for the minimum annual cargo volume to break even, assuming they're making enough revenue to cover costs.\n\nAlso, the ship can carry up to 100,000 tons per voyage, but it's not specified how many voyages it makes per year. Maybe that's something to consider, but since the revenue is based on tons shipped, not on voyages, I think we can proceed with the previous calculation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the company needs to ship at least 400,000 tons of cargo per year to break even over the 25-year operational life of the ship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400000} \\]"
