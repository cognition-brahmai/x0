        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls are in the class.\n\nThe class has 30 students, and 60% of them are boys. So, to find the number of boys:\n\nNumber of boys = 60% of 30 = (60/100) * 30 = 18 boys\n\nSince the rest are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 30 - 18 = 12 girls\n\nNow, we need to find out how many boys have glasses and how many girls have glasses.\n\nHalf of the boys have glasses, so:\n\nNumber of boys with glasses = 1/2 of 18 = 9 boys\n\nOne-third of the girls have glasses, so:\n\nNumber of girls with glasses = 1/3 of 12 = 4 girls\n\nTo find the total number of students with glasses, we add the number of boys with glasses and the number of girls with glasses:\n\nTotal students with glasses = Boys with glasses + Girls with glasses = 9 + 4 = 13 students\n\nSo, 13 students in total have glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
