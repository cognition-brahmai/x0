        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students studying languages. There are 40 students in total, and among them, 12 study French, 17 study Spanish, and 5 study both languages. I need to find out how many students don't study either language. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what's being asked. There are students who study French, Spanish, both, or neither. I need to find out how many study neither. So, if I can find out how many students are studying at least one of the languages, I can subtract that number from the total number of students to find those who study neither.\n\nAlright, so the total number of students is 40. Now, 12 study French and 17 study Spanish, but 5 study both. I need to be careful here because those 5 students are included in both the French and Spanish counts. So, if I just add 12 and 17, that would be 29, but that includes the 5 students twice\u2014once for French and once for Spanish. To get the total number of students studying at least one language, I need to subtract those 5 students so they're not double-counted.\n\nSo, the number of students studying at least one language would be:\n\n12 (French) + 17 (Spanish) - 5 (both) = 24 students.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't study either language, I subtract the number studying at least one language from the total number of students:\n\n40 (total students) - 24 (studying at least one language) = 16 students.\n\nSo, 16 students don't study either French or Spanish.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I remember there's a formula for this kind of problem, called the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula is:\n\nNumber of students studying at least one language = Number studying French + Number studying Spanish - Number studying both.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did: 12 + 17 - 5 = 24.\n\nThen, the number not studying any language is total students minus those studying at least one language: 40 - 24 = 16.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of sets. Let's say set F is the set of students studying French, and set S is the set of students studying Spanish. The number of students studying at least one language is the union of sets F and S, which is |F \u222a S| = |F| + |S| - |F \u2229 S|.\n\nGiven:\n\n|F| = 12,\n\n|S| = 17,\n\n|F \u2229 S| = 5.\n\nSo, |F \u222a S| = 12 + 17 - 5 = 24.\n\nAnd the number of students studying neither is the total number minus the union: 40 - 24 = 16.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the students studying only French, only Spanish, and both, and then see how many are left.\n\nStudents studying only French: 12 - 5 = 7.\n\nStudents studying only Spanish: 17 - 5 = 12.\n\nStudents studying both: 5.\n\nSo, total studying at least one language: 7 + 12 + 5 = 24.\n\nAgain, total students minus those studying at least one language: 40 - 24 = 16.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation, so I'm confident now.\n\nI guess another way to approach this is to use a Venn diagram. If I draw two circles overlapping, one for French and one for Spanish, the overlap would be the 5 students studying both. Then, the part of the French circle not overlapping is 12 - 5 = 7, and the part of the Spanish circle not overlapping is 17 - 5 = 12. So, adding up the parts: 7 + 12 + 5 = 24 studying at least one language, and again, 40 - 24 = 16 studying neither.\n\nI think no matter which way I look at it, the answer comes out to be 16 students.\n\nLet me see if there's any other perspective I should consider. Maybe using probabilities or something, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the complement. The complement of studying at least one language is studying neither. So, by finding the number studying at least one and subtracting from total, I get the number studying neither, which is what I did.\n\nI don't think there's any mistake here. The answer should be 16 students.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any students who might be studying other languages not mentioned here. The problem says \"study French\", \"study Spanish\", and \"study both languages\", but it doesn't mention any other languages. So, I'm assuming that the only languages being considered are French and Spanish, and any student who isn't studying French or Spanish is studying neither.\n\nIf there were students studying other languages, the problem would probably specify, but since it doesn't, I'm safe to assume that only French and Spanish are relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 16 students who do not study either language.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
