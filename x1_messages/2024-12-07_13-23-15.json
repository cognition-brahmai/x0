        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a basket with 3 red apples and 5 green apples, making a total of 8 apples. We're supposed to pick two apples at random without replacement, and we need to find the probability that both apples are red.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to pick 2 red apples, and the total possible outcomes are the ways to pick any 2 apples from the basket.\n\nSince we're picking without replacement, the order in which we pick the apples doesn't matter. So, this is a combination problem, not a permutation problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red apples from 3 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ C(3, 2) = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = 3 \\]\n\nSimilarly, the total number of ways to choose any 2 apples from 8 is:\n\n\\[ C(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that both apples are red is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{3}{28} \\]\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach it that could confirm this result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability of picking a red apple on the first draw and then another red apple on the second draw, given that the first one was red.\n\nThe probability of picking a red apple first is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{first red}) = \\frac{3}{8} \\]\n\nAfter picking one red apple, there are now 2 red apples left and a total of 7 apples left in the basket. So, the probability of picking another red apple is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{2}{7} \\]\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, we multiply these probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{first red}) \\times P(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{6}{56} = \\frac{3}{28} \\]\n\nOkay, this matches the previous result. So, the probability is indeed \\( \\frac{3}{28} \\).\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can approach this yet another way. Let's think about it in terms of permutations.\n\nIf we consider the order in which we pick the apples, the total number of ways to pick 2 apples from 8 is:\n\n\\[ P(8, 2) = 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\]\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 red apples in order is:\n\n\\[ P(3, 2) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{6}{56} = \\frac{3}{28} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems like no matter which way I approach this problem, I end up with \\( \\frac{3}{28} \\).\n\nPerhaps I can also consider the complementary probability, but in this case, it's more straightforward to stick with the direct approach.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the probability that both apples picked are red is \\( \\frac{3}{28} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{28}} \\]"
