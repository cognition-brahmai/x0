The battle pitted the French Army, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, against the Allied armies, consisting of Dutch, Prussian, British, Hanoverian, and Brunswick forces, commanded by the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal Bl\u00fccher. This decisive battle resulted in Napoleon's defeat and led to his abdication and exile, effectively ending his reign as Emperor of the French."
