        "content": "So there's this problem here: a box contains 15 red balls and 10 blue balls. I need to find out what fraction of the balls are blue. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think I need to know the total number of balls in the box. There are 15 red balls and 10 blue balls, so the total number should be 15 plus 10. Let me add those up: 15 + 10 equals 25. So, there are 25 balls in total.\n\nNow, I need to find out what fraction of these 25 balls are blue. There are 10 blue balls, so the fraction should be 10 out of 25. In fraction terms, that's 10/25.\n\nI remember that fractions can be simplified. So, maybe I can simplify 10/25. To simplify a fraction, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is 10, and the denominator is 25.\n\nLet's think about the factors of 10 and 25. The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25. The greatest common divisor is the largest number that divides both 10 and 25 without leaving a remainder. Looking at the factors, that would be 5.\n\nSo, I can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5. 10 divided by 5 is 2, and 25 divided by 5 is 5. Therefore, 10/25 simplifies to 2/5.\n\nSo, the fraction of blue balls is 2/5.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check my calculations. Total balls: 15 red + 10 blue = 25 balls. Blue balls: 10. Fraction: 10/25. Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 5: 10 \u00f7 5 = 2, 25 \u00f7 5 = 5. So, yes, 2/5.\n\nI think that's correct. But maybe I should consider if there's another way to look at this problem. For example, sometimes percentages are used, but the question asks for a fraction, so 2/5 is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, I could confirm this by converting the fraction to decimal form. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. If I convert 10/25 to a decimal, 10 divided by 25 is also 0.4. So, that matches.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of blue balls to total balls. The ratio is 10:25, which can be simplified to 2:5, which is the same as the fraction 2/5.\n\nI feel confident that 2/5 is the correct answer. But to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there anything else I need to consider in this problem? It seems straightforward: find the fraction of blue balls in a box containing both red and blue balls.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's imagine that there are other colors of balls in the box, but the problem only mentions red and blue balls. So, I can assume that there are only two colors: red and blue.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't mix up the numbers. The problem says 15 red balls and 10 blue balls. Yes, 15 red and 10 blue, total of 25 balls.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of picking a blue ball at random. The probability would be the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls, which is again 10/25, or 2/5.\n\nWait, the problem is about fractions, not probability, but the concept is similar. Anyway, it's just another way to verify the answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The fraction of blue balls is indeed 2/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
