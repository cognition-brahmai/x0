        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a library with 500 books in total. Half of these are fiction, and the other half are non-fiction. First things first, I need to figure out how many fiction books there are.\n\nSince half of the 500 books are fiction, I can calculate that by dividing 500 by 2. So, 500 divided by 2 equals 250. That means there are 250 fiction books and 250 non-fiction books.\n\nNow, the problem states that 20% of the fiction books are thrillers. So, I need to find out what 20% of 250 is. To calculate 20% of a number, I can multiply that number by 0.20. So, 250 multiplied by 0.20 should give me the number of thriller books.\n\nLet me do the math: 250 times 0.20 equals 50. So, there are 50 thriller books in the library.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm my answer. Let's see.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that 20% of the fiction books are thrillers. So, if I think about percentages, 20% is equivalent to one-fifth. So, one-fifth of the fiction books should be thrillers.\n\nSince there are 250 fiction books, dividing 250 by 5 should also give me the number of thriller books. Let's try that: 250 divided by 5 equals 50. Okay, that matches my previous calculation. So, 50 thrillers seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the total number of books again. 500 books, half fiction and half non-fiction. That makes 250 fiction and 250 non-fiction. Now, 20% of the fiction books are thrillers, which is 50 books.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this information? Maybe someone could misread the problem and think that 20% of all books are thrillers, but that wouldn't be correct because the problem specifies that 20% of the fiction books are thrillers.\n\nIf I were to mistakenly calculate 20% of the total books, that would be 20% of 500, which is 100 books. But that's not what the problem is saying. It's only 20% of the fiction books that are thrillers, not 20% of all books.\n\nSo, sticking to the correct interpretation, the library has 50 thriller books.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if there are any other types of thrillers in the non-fiction section. But the problem doesn't mention any thrillers in the non-fiction category, so I should assume that all thrillers are within the fiction books.\n\nTherefore, the total number of thriller books in the library is 50.\n\nAnother angle to consider: if there are 250 fiction books and 20% of them are thrillers, then the remaining 80% are other types of fiction books. So, 80% of 250 is 200 books, which would be non-thriller fiction books.\n\nAdding up the thrillers and other fiction books: 50 thrillers plus 200 other fiction books equals 250 fiction books, which matches the initial amount. So, that checks out.\n\nAlso, considering the non-fiction books: there are 250 of them, but since the problem doesn't mention any thrillers in non-fiction, I can assume there are no thrillers in that section.\n\nTherefore, the total number of thriller books in the library is solely based on the fiction section, which is 50 books.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But to be absolutely sure, let me try another method.\n\nLet\u2019s use proportions. If 20% of fiction books are thrillers, that means for every 100 fiction books, 20 are thrillers.\n\nSince there are 250 fiction books, which is 2.5 times 100, then the number of thrillers would be 2.5 times 20, which is 50.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in fractions. 20% is equivalent to 1/5. So, one-fifth of the fiction books are thrillers.\n\nTherefore, 1/5 of 250 is 50.\n\nAll these different methods lead me to the same conclusion that there are 50 thriller books in the library.\n\nI can't think of any other way to interpret the given information, so I'm confident that 50 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
