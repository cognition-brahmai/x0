        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains leaving from different stations and heading towards each other. Station A and Station B are 280 miles apart. One train leaves Station A going towards B at 60 miles per hour, and at the same time, another train leaves Station B going towards A at 80 miles per hour. I need to find out how long it will take for these two trains to meet.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to visualize this scenario. So, there are two trains starting at the same time from both stations, moving towards each other. The total distance between them is 280 miles. Train from A is moving at 60 mph, and the train from B is moving at 80 mph.\n\nI recall that when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speeds add up. So, the combined speed at which they are approaching each other would be the sum of their individual speeds. That makes sense because one is moving towards the other, so their speeds sort of stack up.\n\nSo, combined speed = 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance they need to cover before they meet is 280 miles. So, time taken to meet should be distance divided by their combined speed. Because time is distance divided by speed.\n\nSo, time = distance / speed = 280 miles / 140 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that. 280 divided by 140 is 2. So, time should be 2 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf train A is going at 60 mph, in 2 hours, it would cover 120 miles. Train B is going at 80 mph, so in 2 hours, it would cover 160 miles. Together, they would have covered 120 + 160 = 280 miles, which is exactly the distance between the stations. So, yes, they would meet after 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is 140 mph, and the distance is 280 miles, so time is 280 / 140 = 2 hours. Same answer.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm? Maybe using the concept of closing the gap.\n\nSo, each hour, train A closes the gap by 60 miles, and train B closes it by 80 miles. Together, they close the gap by 140 miles per hour. So, to close a 280-mile gap, it would take 280 / 140 = 2 hours. Again, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation based on the time each train travels before they meet.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, train A would have traveled 60t miles.\n\nIn the same t hours, train B would have traveled 80t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the total distance between the stations.\n\nSo, 60t + 80t = 280.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 140t = 280.\n\nNow, solving for t: t = 280 / 140 = 2 hours.\n\nOnce again, the same answer.\n\nLet me try to visualize it differently. Suppose I plot the positions of both trains over time on a graph, with time on the x-axis and distance from Station A on the y-axis.\n\nTrain A is starting at Station A, which is at distance 0, and moving towards Station B at 60 mph, so its position over time is y = 60t.\n\nTrain B is starting at Station B, which is at distance 280 miles, and moving towards Station A at 80 mph, so its position over time is y = 280 - 80t.\n\nThey meet when their positions are equal, so 60t = 280 - 80t.\n\nSolving for t: 60t + 80t = 280 \u21d2 140t = 280 \u21d2 t = 2 hours.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nIs there any other method I can use to confirm this? Maybe thinking about the ratio of their speeds.\n\nThe speed of train A is 60 mph, and train B is 80 mph. The ratio of their speeds is 60:80, which simplifies to 3:4.\n\nThat means for every 3 miles train A travels, train B travels 4 miles.\n\nNow, since they're moving towards each other, the point where they meet should divide the total distance in the ratio of their speeds.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the distances they travel should be in the ratio of their speeds because time is the same for both.\n\nSo, distance is speed multiplied by time.\n\nSince time is the same, the ratio of distances is equal to the ratio of speeds.\n\nSo, distance A : distance B = speed A : speed B = 60 : 80 = 3 : 4.\n\nSo, the total distance is 280 miles, divided in a 3:4 ratio.\n\nSo, distance A = (3/7) * 280 = 120 miles.\n\nDistance B = (4/7) * 280 = 160 miles.\n\nNow, time taken would be the same for both, which is time = distance / speed.\n\nFor train A: time = 120 / 60 = 2 hours.\n\nFor train B: time = 160 / 80 = 2 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of relative speed in different reference frames.\n\nSuppose I stand on train A. From train A's frame of reference, train B is approaching at a speed of 80 mph + 60 mph = 140 mph because both are moving towards each other.\n\nThe distance between them is still 280 miles.\n\nSo, time taken for train B to cover that distance from train A's perspective is 280 / 140 = 2 hours.\n\nSame answer yet again.\n\nLet me think if there's any possibility that this isn't correct.\n\nWait, what if the trains are not moving at constant speeds? But the problem states their speeds are 60 mph and 80 mph, which I assume are constant.\n\nAlso, I assume that they are moving on the same straight track towards each other, which is the typical setup for such problems.\n\nIf there were any acceleration or deceleration, that would complicate things, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, if the speeds were given in different units or if there were any conversion factors, but in this case, both speeds are in mph, and the distance is in miles, so units are consistent.\n\nSo, dividing miles by miles per hour gives hours, which is correct for time.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the starting times are exactly simultaneous. The problem says \"at the same time,\" so I assume they start at the same instant.\n\nIf there was a time difference in their starts, that would affect the calculation, but here, they start together.\n\nAlternatively, if the direction wasn't exactly towards each other, but the problem specifies that they are moving towards each other.\n\nSo, I think all assumptions are correctly aligned with the problem statement.\n\nLet me consider if there is any trick or common mistake in such problems.\n\nOne common mistake is to consider only one train's speed or to subtract the speeds instead of adding them.\n\nBut in this case, since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nAnother potential mistake is to confuse speed with velocity, but since they are moving directly towards each other, their speeds add up.\n\nAlternatively, if the distance was not the direct distance between the stations but along some other path, but the problem states it's between Station A and Station B, which are 280 miles apart.\n\nSo, I think the straightforward approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the two trains to meet is 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
