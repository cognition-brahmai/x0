The hospital has narrowed down their choices to two options: Option A costs $8 million and has an annual maintenance cost of $200,000, while Option B costs $6 million with an annual maintenance cost of $400,000. Calculate the total cost of ownership for each option over a period of 10 years, considering both initial investment and maintenance costs."

        "content": "To calculate the total cost of ownership for each option over a period of 10 years, we need to consider both the initial investment and the annual maintenance costs over that time frame.\n\nLet's start with Option A:\n\n1. Initial cost: $8,000,000\n\n2. Annual maintenance cost: $200,000\n\nOver 10 years, the total maintenance cost would be:\n\n$200,000 * 10 = $2,000,000\n\nTherefore, the total cost of ownership for Option A over 10 years is:\n\n$8,000,000 (initial cost) + $2,000,000 (maintenance) = $10,000,000\n\nNow, let's look at Option B:\n\n1. Initial cost: $6,000,000\n\n2. Annual maintenance cost: $400,000\n\nOver 10 years, the total maintenance cost would be:\n\n$400,000 * 10 = $4,000,000\n\nTherefore, the total cost of ownership for Option B over 10 years is:\n\n$6,000,000 (initial cost) + $4,000,000 (maintenance) = $10,000,000\n\nInterestingly, both options have the same total cost of ownership over 10 years, amounting to $10,000,000. This means that despite Option A having a higher initial cost and lower annual maintenance, and Option B having a lower initial cost but higher annual maintenance, the overall expenditure over 10 years is identical.\n\nThis suggests that, from a purely financial perspective over this time frame, neither option is more cost-effective than the other. However, there might be other factors to consider, such as the quality of the equipment, longevity beyond 10 years, compatibility with the hospital's current systems, staff training requirements, and potential for technological advancements during that period.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the hospital has a budget of $10 million allocated for this purpose. Since both options fit within this budget when considering the total cost of ownership over 10 years, the decision might come down to non-financial factors.\n\nIf the hospital expects to keep the equipment beyond 10 years, it would be useful to project the total cost of ownership for a longer period, considering possible changes in maintenance costs or additional expenses.\n\nAdditionally, if there are any financing options or depreciation factors that affect the cash flow over the 10 years, those should also be taken into account. For example, if the hospital can finance the initial purchase with a loan, the interest costs would need to be added to the total cost of ownership.\n\nIn summary, based on the provided data and a 10-year period, both Option A and Option B have the same total cost of ownership of $10 million. The hospital should consider other criteria to make their final decision."
