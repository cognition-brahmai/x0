        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a multinational corporation expanding its operations. They're planning to open new offices in five different countries over the next two years. Each office starts with 100 employees and plans to grow to 500 employees within five years. I need to calculate the total number of workstations, meeting rooms, and other facilities needed for each office at full capacity. Also, consider that each employee requires one workstation, there should be one meeting room per 25 employees, and additional facilities like break rooms and restrooms account for 10% of the total space.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the requirements for one office at full capacity, which is 500 employees.\n\n1. **Workstations:**\n\n   Each employee requires one workstation. So, for 500 employees, the number of workstations needed is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Workstations} = 500 \\text{ employees} \\times 1 \\text{ workstation/employee} = 500 \\text{ workstations}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Meeting Rooms:**\n\n   There should be one meeting room for every 25 employees. So, for 500 employees, the number of meeting rooms needed is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Meeting Rooms} = \\frac{500 \\text{ employees}}{25 \\text{ employees/meeting room}} = 20 \\text{ meeting rooms}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Other Facilities:**\n\n   Additional facilities like break rooms and restrooms account for 10% of the total space. The total space here likely refers to the space occupied by workstations and meeting rooms combined.\n\n   First, let's find the total space for workstations and meeting rooms.\n\n   Assuming each workstation and each meeting room requires a certain amount of space, but since the problem doesn't specify the exact square footage, I'll consider the \"total space\" to be the sum of the spaces allocated for workstations and meeting rooms.\n\n   However, without specific square footage per workstation or meeting room, I'll treat \"total space\" as the number of workstations plus the number of meeting rooms for the purpose of calculating the additional facilities.\n\n   So,\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Space} = \\text{Workstations} + \\text{Meeting Rooms} = 500 + 20 = 520\n   \\]\n\n   Then, the additional facilities accounting for 10% of the total space would be:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional Facilities} = 0.10 \\times 520 = 52\n   \\]\n\n   But this seems a bit abstract because it's not clear what unit \"52\" represents. If \"total space\" is in terms of units (like workstations and meeting rooms), then additional facilities would also be in similar units. However, it might be more practical to think in terms of square footage or number of rooms, but since we don't have specific sizes, I'll proceed with this calculation.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the total number of workstations, meeting rooms, and other facilities needed for each office at full capacity.\n\nSo, summing them up:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Facilities per Office} = \\text{Workstations} + \\text{Meeting Rooms} + \\text{Additional Facilities} = 500 + 20 + 52 = 572\n\\]\n\nBut again, the \"572\" is a sum of different types of facilities, which might not be directly additive in real-world terms. However, based on the problem's instructions, this is the total number of units needed.\n\nSince the corporation is planning to open offices in five different countries, and each office has the same requirements, the total for all five offices would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total for Five Offices} = 572 \\times 5 = 2,860\n\\]\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the total number for each office, so the answer should be 572 per office.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to provide separate numbers for workstations, meeting rooms, and additional facilities for each office, rather than a combined total.\n\nLet me check the question again: \"Calculate the total number of workstations, meeting rooms, and other facilities needed for each office at full capacity...\"\n\nSo, it might be clearer to present the numbers separately:\n\n- Workstations: 500\n\n- Meeting Rooms: 20\n\n- Additional Facilities: 52\n\nTotal facilities per office: 572\n\nAlternatively, if \"total number\" is meant to be the sum, then 572 is acceptable, but separating them might provide more clarity.\n\nAlso, considering that workstations, meeting rooms, and additional facilities are different types of spaces, it might be more informative to list them separately.\n\nFurthermore, perhaps the \"additional facilities\" should be calculated based on the total number of employees, not just the sum of workstations and meeting rooms.\n\nLet me reconsider that.\n\nIf the additional facilities account for 10% of the total space, and total space is based on the number of employees, then perhaps:\n\nTotal space required per employee = 1 workstation + (1 meeting room / 25 employees)\n\nSo, for 500 employees:\n\nTotal workstations = 500\n\nTotal meeting rooms = 20\n\nBut meeting rooms are shared among employees, so the space allocated per employee for meeting rooms is less.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider that each employee requires 1 workstation and a share of the meeting rooms and additional facilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"total space\" should be calculated based on the total number of employees, including the space for workstations, meeting rooms, and additional facilities.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet \\( E \\) be the number of employees, which is 500.\n\nEach employee requires 1 workstation, so workstations = \\( E \\times 1 = 500 \\).\n\nMeeting rooms = \\( \\frac{E}{25} = 20 \\).\n\nAdditional facilities = 10% of the total space, where total space includes workstations and meeting rooms.\n\nBut perhaps total space should include the space for all these facilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe additional facilities are calculated based on the number of employees directly.\n\nLet me consider that additional facilities require space for 10% of the number of employees.\n\nSo, additional facilities = \\( 0.10 \\times E = 0.10 \\times 500 = 50 \\).\n\nThen, total facilities would be:\n\nWorkstations: 500\n\nMeeting rooms: 20\n\nAdditional facilities: 50\n\nTotal: 500 + 20 + 50 = 570\n\nThis is slightly different from my previous calculation of 572, due to rounding or a different interpretation of \"10% of total space.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps additional facilities should be 10% of the total number of workstations and meeting rooms.\n\nIn that case:\n\nTotal space = workstations + meeting rooms = 500 + 20 = 520\n\nAdditional facilities = 10% of 520 = 52\n\nTotal facilities = 500 + 20 + 52 = 572\n\nSo, sticking with this, total facilities per office is 572.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure about the exact interpretation of \"additional facilities account for 10% of the total space.\"\n\nMaybe I should ask for clarification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the additional facilities are separate from the workstations and meeting rooms, and that the 10% is of the total space, which includes all three components.\n\nLet me try setting up an equation where total space \\( T \\) includes workstations, meeting rooms, and additional facilities, with additional facilities being 10% of \\( T \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nT = \\text{Workstations} + \\text{Meeting Rooms} + \\text{Additional Facilities}\n\\]\n\nGiven that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Additional Facilities} = 0.10 \\times T\n\\]\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\[\nT = 500 + 20 + 0.10T\n\\]\n\n\\[\nT - 0.10T = 520\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.90T = 520\n\\]\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{520}{0.90} \\approx 577.78\n\\]\n\nSo, total facilities \\( T \\) is approximately 577.78, which I can round to 578.\n\nTherefore, the total number of facilities needed per office is 578.\n\nThis seems more accurate, as it takes into account that the additional facilities are part of the total space, including themselves in the calculation.\n\nThus, the final answer is approximately 578 facilities per office.\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a facility, we might need to round up to the next whole number, which is 578.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Workstations: 500\n\n- Meeting Rooms: 20\n\n- Additional Facilities: 58 (since 578 - 520 = 58)\n\nTotal facilities per office: 578\n\nAnd for five offices: 578 \u00d7 5 = 2,890 facilities.\n\nBut the question asks for each office, so the answer is 578 facilities per office.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{578} \\]"
