        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a car factory. It says that the factory produces 120 cars per day and operates for 250 days in a year. I need to find out how many cars it will produce in 3 years, with the production increasing by 10% each year. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current production rate. The factory makes 120 cars per day and works for 250 days a year. So, the annual production for the first year would be:\n\nAnnual production, Year 1 = 120 cars/day * 250 days/year\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n120 * 250 = 30,000 cars per year.\n\nOkay, so in the first year, they produce 30,000 cars.\n\nNow, the production increases by 10% each year. So, for the second year, the production rate per day would increase by 10%. Let's calculate the new daily production for Year 2.\n\nIncreased daily production, Year 2 = 120 cars/day + (10% of 120 cars/day)\n\n10% of 120 is 12, so:\n\n120 + 12 = 132 cars/day\n\nSo, in the second year, they produce 132 cars per day.\n\nNow, again, they operate for 250 days in the year, so the annual production for Year 2 is:\n\nAnnual production, Year 2 = 132 cars/day * 250 days/year\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n132 * 250 = 33,000 cars per year.\n\nAlright, so in the second year, they produce 33,000 cars.\n\nNow, for the third year, the production increases by another 10%. So, the daily production for Year 3 would be:\n\nIncreased daily production, Year 3 = 132 cars/day + (10% of 132 cars/day)\n\n10% of 132 is 13.2, so:\n\n132 + 13.2 = 145.2 cars/day\n\nWait, but we can't really produce a fraction of a car, but since the problem is in terms of cars produced, I suppose it's acceptable to have a decimal for calculation purposes.\n\nSo, in the third year, they produce 145.2 cars per day.\n\nAgain, operating for 250 days, the annual production for Year 3 is:\n\nAnnual production, Year 3 = 145.2 cars/day * 250 days/year\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n145.2 * 250 = 36,300 cars per year.\n\nSo, in the third year, they produce 36,300 cars.\n\nNow, to find the total production over the 3 years, I need to add up the annual productions for each year.\n\nTotal production = Year 1 + Year 2 + Year 3\n\n= 30,000 + 33,000 + 36,300\n\nLet's add those up:\n\n30,000 + 33,000 = 63,000\n\n63,000 + 36,300 = 99,300 cars\n\nSo, over 3 years, the factory will produce 99,300 cars.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there a better way to calculate this, maybe using the concept of percentage increase over years?\n\nYes, actually, the production increases by 10% each year, which means each year's production is 110% of the previous year's production.\n\nSo, another way to look at it is that each year's production is multiplied by 1.10 compared to the previous year.\n\nSo, for Year 1: 30,000 cars\n\nYear 2: 30,000 * 1.10 = 33,000 cars\n\nYear 3: 33,000 * 1.10 = 36,300 cars\n\nAdding them up gives the same total: 30,000 + 33,000 + 36,300 = 99,300 cars.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a geometric progression, I could use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nS = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S is the sum\n\n- a is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this case:\n\na = 30,000 (production in Year 1)\n\nr = 1.10 (10% increase each year)\n\nn = 3 (three years)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nS = 30,000 * (1 - 1.10^3) / (1 - 1.10)\n\nFirst, calculate 1.10^3:\n\n1.10^3 = 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 = 1.331\n\nNow, 1 - 1.331 = -0.331\n\nAnd 1 - 1.10 = -0.10\n\nSo, S = 30,000 * (-0.331) / (-0.10)\n\nThe negatives cancel out:\n\nS = 30,000 * 0.331 / 0.10\n\nDividing 0.331 by 0.10 is the same as multiplying by 10:\n\n0.331 / 0.10 = 3.31\n\nSo, S = 30,000 * 3.31 = 99,300 cars\n\nSame result as before. Good, that confirms the calculation.\n\nWait, but is there a way to calculate the total production without calculating each year's production separately?\n\nYes, using the sum of a geometric series, as I just did. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of years is larger.\n\nBut for three years, calculating each year separately is manageable.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider if the production increase is applied at the beginning or end of each year. The problem says the production increases by 10% each year, but it doesn't specify when the increase is applied.\n\nHowever, since it's an annual increase and the problem gives the annual production days and daily production, it's reasonable to assume that the increase is applied at the beginning of each year.\n\nBut in our calculations, we've assumed that the increase happens at the start of each year, affecting the entire year's production.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider? The number of operating days remains the same each year at 250 days, so that doesn't change.\n\nAlso, the daily production increases by 10% each year, which seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if the 10% increase is compounded on the daily production or the annual production. In this case, since the increase is stated as a percentage increase in production each year, and production is given in cars per day, it makes sense that the daily production increases by 10% each year.\n\nAlternatively, if the increase was applied to the annual production, but since the operating days are constant, increasing daily production by 10% would directly translate to a 10% increase in annual production.\n\nSo, our approach seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total production over three years with the increasing production rate.\n\nYear 1: 30,000 cars\n\nYear 2: 30,000 * 1.10 = 33,000 cars\n\nYear 3: 33,000 * 1.10 = 36,300 cars\n\nTotal: 30,000 + 33,000 + 36,300 = 99,300 cars\n\nAlternatively, using the geometric series sum formula, which gave the same result.\n\nTherefore, the total production over three years is 99,300 cars.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{99300} \\]\n"
