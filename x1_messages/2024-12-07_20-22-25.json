        "content": "This seems like a riddle. Let's see if I can figure it out. The first line says, \"I never was, am always to be.\" That sounds like something that exists in the future but not in the past. Maybe it's related to time or expectations.\n\nThe second line says, \"No one ever saw me, nor ever will.\" So, whatever it is, it's invisible or intangible in some way. It can't be something physical that we can see.\n\nThe third line says, \"And yet I am the confidence of all,\" which suggests that it's something that gives people assurance or faith. Maybe it's an abstract concept that people rely on.\n\nThe last line is, \"To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball.\" That probably means it's something essential for life on Earth, but again, it's probably not a physical thing.\n\nLet me think about abstract concepts that fit these descriptions. Could it be hope? Hope is something that's always in the future, people can't see it, and it gives confidence to live. But I'm not sure if it's essential for breathing.\n\nOr maybe it's the future itself. The future is always to be, never was in the past, invisible, and people have confidence in it to continue living. But again, not sure about breathing.\n\nWait, breathing is a physical act, so maybe it's not directly related. Maybe it's just a way of saying existing on Earth.\n\nAnother thought: could it be tomorrow? Tomorrow is always in the future, no one has seen it yet, and it gives people confidence that there will be another day.\n\nBut I feel like there's more to it. Let me look at the phrases more closely.\n\n\"I never was, am always to be.\" This could refer to something that doesn't exist yet but is always impending or approaching.\n\n\"No one ever saw me, nor ever will.\" So, it's invisible and intangible.\n\n\"And yet I am the confidence of all, To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball.\" This suggests it's something fundamental that allows life to continue, but not in a physical sense.\n\nWait a minute, could it be death? Death is always in the future for each individual, no one has seen it, and perhaps people have confidence in the unknown afterlife or the concept of death allowing for the cycle of life.\n\nBut that seems a bit dark. Maybe it's not death.\n\nLet's think differently. Could it be progress or evolution? These are concepts that always look towards the future, are invisible, and give people confidence in the advancement of society and humanity.\n\nOr maybe it's destiny or fate, something that people believe in that gives them confidence to continue living.\n\nAnother possibility is the afterlife or heaven, something that is always in the future, unseen, and provides confidence to live.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nPerhaps it's a more mundane concept. Could it be tomorrow, as I thought earlier? Tomorrow is always coming, never was in the past, invisible, and people look forward to it.\n\nBut I feel like that might be too simplistic.\n\nLet me try to think of it differently. If I consider the phrase \"to live and breathe on this terrestrial ball,\" maybe it's referring to something that makes life possible on Earth.\n\nBut the earlier lines suggest it's not physical. So, maybe it's an abstract necessity for life.\n\nWait, could it be imagination or belief? These are intangible, always in the future in a sense, and give people confidence to live.\n\nBut I'm still not confident with that answer.\n\nLet me see if there's a word that fits all these descriptions. I need something that:\n\n- Doesn't exist in the past but always in the future.\n\n- Invisible and intangible.\n\n- Gives confidence to all living beings on Earth.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe it's the concept of \"tomorrow.\" Tomorrow is always coming; it never exists in the past. No one can see it, and it gives people hope and confidence for the future.\n\nBut again, I feel like there might be a better answer.\n\nAlternatively, could it be \"promise\" or \"potential\"? These are always in the future, intangible, and give people confidence to continue living.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely satisfied with that.\n\nLet me consider the riddle again.\n\n\"I never was, am always to be.\" This could refer to something that is eternally in the future, never becoming present.\n\n\"No one ever saw me, nor ever will.\" So, it's invisible and perhaps even abstract.\n\n\"And yet I am the confidence of all, To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball.\" This suggests it's something that all living beings rely on in some way for their existence or their peace of mind.\n\nWait a second, could it be \"the future\"? But that seems too broad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"hope for the future.\" Hope is something that is always in the future, invisible, and gives people the confidence to live.\n\nBut perhaps there's a single word that fits all these descriptions.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Is there a philosophical concept that fits this description?\n\nMaybe \"utopia\"? A utopia is a perfect place or state that never exists but is always strived for, giving people confidence and hope.\n\nBut utopia is a specific type of perfect society, and not everyone may believe in it.\n\nAlternatively, could it be \"heaven\" or \"nirvana\"? These are concepts that are always in the future, unseen, and provide confidence to live.\n\nBut again, these are specific to certain belief systems.\n\nI need something more universal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's \"eternity\". Eternity is always in the future, unseen, and gives confidence in the idea of everlasting life.\n\nBut eternity can also refer to the infinite past, which contradicts the first line.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe \"eternal life\" or \"immortality\"?\n\nBut similar issue; it's something people hope for in the future, unseen, and gives them confidence to live.\n\nBut again, not everyone believes in immortality.\n\nI need something that is the confidence of all living beings, not just humans, and not just those with certain beliefs.\n\nPerhaps it's \"the unknown future\"? The unknown future is always to come, unseen, and gives living beings confidence to continue existing.\n\nBut that seems a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, could it be \"time\"? Time is always in the future, unseen, and essential for life on Earth.\n\nBut time exists in the past and present as well, which contradicts the first line.\n\nWait, the first line says \"I never was, am always to be.\" So, perhaps it's something that only exists in the future, not in the past or present.\n\nBut time exists in all three.\n\nMaybe it's \"the future itself.\"\n\nBut I feel like that might be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, could it be \"death\"? Death is always in the future for each individual, unseen, and in some beliefs, it's the confidence that allows life to continue.\n\nBut that seems a bit macabre.\n\nAnother thought: could it be \"dreams\"? Dreams are always in the future, intangible, and give people confidence to live.\n\nBut dreams are also experienced in the present during sleep.\n\nSo, that might not fit perfectly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's \"aspiration\" or \"goal\"? These are always in the future, unseen, and give people confidence to live.\n\nBut again, these are specific to individuals and their ambitions.\n\nI need something more universal.\n\nLet me consider the confidence of all living beings. Plants, animals, humans\u2014what do they all have in common in terms of confidence?\n\nWell, perhaps the confidence to continue living, breathing, existing.\n\nIs there a universal concept that allows all life to exist and continue?\n\nMaybe it's \"the cycle of life.\" The cycle of life is eternal, always continuing into the future, unseen, and gives confidence to all living beings that life will go on.\n\nBut the cycle of life includes birth, growth, death, and rebirth, which might contradict the first line about \"never was.\"\n\nAlternatively, could it be \"rebirth\" or \"reincarnation\"? These concepts are always in the future, unseen, and give confidence in continued existence.\n\nBut again, these are specific to certain belief systems.\n\nI'm starting to think that \"the future\" is the most straightforward answer.\n\nIt never was (in the past), always to be (in the future), unseen, and gives confidence to all living beings to continue existing.\n\nAlternatively, could it be \"tomorrow\"? Tomorrow is always coming, never was in the past, unseen, and gives daily confidence to live.\n\nBut tomorrow is a part of the future, and perhaps too specific.\n\nI think \"the future\" is the best fit.\n\nSo, the answer to the riddle is \"the future.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{the future}} \\]"
