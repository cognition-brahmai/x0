        "content": "To determine the electric field strength at a distance from a point charge, we can use Coulomb's law for electric fields. The electric field \\( E \\) due to a point charge \\( q \\) at a distance \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nE = k \\frac{q}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( k \\) is the Coulomb constant, approximately \\( 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{C}^2 \\)\n\n- \\( q \\) is the magnitude of the point charge\n\n- \\( r \\) is the distance from the point charge\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( q = 2 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{C} \\)\n\n- \\( r = 0.5 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\nLet's plug in these values into the formula.\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[\nr^2 = (0.5 \\, \\text{m})^2 = 0.25 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the electric field:\n\n\\[\nE = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{C}^2 \\times \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{C}}{0.25 \\, \\text{m}^2}\n\\]\n\nFirst, compute the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.25} = 8 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{C}/\\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by the Coulomb constant:\n\n\\[\nE = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-6} = 71.92 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{N}/\\text{C}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n\\[\nE = 7.192 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{N}/\\text{C}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the electric field strength at a distance of 0.5 meters from a point charge of \\( 2 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{C} \\) is approximately \\( 7.19 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{N}/\\text{C} \\).\n\nIt's important to note that the electric field due to a point charge is radial, meaning it points away from the charge if it's positive and towards the charge if it's negative. In this case, since the charge is positive, the electric field vectors point radially outward from the charge.\n\nAlso, the electric field is a vector quantity, so its direction is significant. However, since the question only asks for the strength (magnitude) of the electric field, we don't need to specify the direction in this answer.\n\nThis formula is derived from Coulomb's law, which describes the force between two point charges. The electric field is defined as the force per unit positive test charge, so by dividing the force by the test charge, we obtain the electric field strength.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this formula is valid in vacuum or air, where the permittivity is that of free space, denoted by \\( \\epsilon_0 \\), which is approximately \\( 8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{C}^2/\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\). The Coulomb constant \\( k \\) is related to \\( \\epsilon_0 \\) by:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0}\n\\]\n\nSo, the electric field formula can also be written as:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nBoth expressions are equivalent and will give the same result.\n\nIn real-world scenarios, if the charge is in a medium with a different permittivity, you would need to adjust the permittivity value accordingly. The permittivity of the medium affects the electric field strength, as it influences how the electric field lines are distributed in the space around the charge.\n\nAdditionally, if the charge distribution is not a point charge but extends over a volume, surface, or line, the calculation of the electric field would involve integration over the charge distribution. However, for a point charge, the formula is straightforward as shown above.\n\nIt's also important to consider the units in calculations involving electric fields. The unit of electric field strength is newtons per coulomb (N/C), which is equivalent to volts per meter (V/m). This equivalence comes from the relationship between force, charge, and potential difference.\n\nIn summary, to find the electric field strength due to a point charge, use the formula \\( E = k \\frac{q}{r^2} \\), ensuring that you have the correct values for the charge and distance, and use the appropriate units for the final answer."
