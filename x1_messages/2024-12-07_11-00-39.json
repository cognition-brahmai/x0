It's a fascinating astronomical event that happens when the Moon aligns perfectly between the Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun's light from reaching Earth. There are different types of solar eclipses, including total, partial, and annular eclipses, each with its own unique characteristics. It's always important to view solar eclipses safely to protect your eyes from the Sun's harmful rays."
