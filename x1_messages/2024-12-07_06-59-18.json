        "content": "So there are 20 students in the classroom, and each student has exactly 3 friends. I need to figure out how many friendships exist among them. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a friendship means here. If student A is friends with student B, then student B is also friends with student A. So, each friendship is a mutual connection between two students.\n\nNow, if each of the 20 students has 3 friends, then at first glance, it might seem like there are 20 times 3, which is 60 friendships. But that would be counting each friendship twice, because each friendship involves two students.\n\nSo, to get the actual number of unique friendships, I should divide that number by 2. That would be 60 divided by 2, which is 30.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me think about a smaller example to confirm.\n\nSuppose there are 4 students, and each has 2 friends. If I imagine them in a circle, each connected to two neighbors, then there should be 4 friendships: A-B, B-C, C-D, and D-A. So, 4 students, each with 2 friends, total friendships are 4.\n\nIf I apply the same logic as before: 4 students times 2 friends each equals 8, then divide by 2 to get 4 unique friendships. That matches my smaller example.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem: 20 students, each with 3 friends. Total friendships should be (20 times 3) divided by 2, which is 30.\n\nBut, is there any other factor I should consider? Is it possible for each student to have exactly 3 friends in this setup? I think it should be possible, as long as the friendships are arranged in a way that doesn't create any conflicts.\n\nI recall that in graph theory, this is similar to finding the number of edges in a graph where each vertex has degree 3, and there are 20 vertices. The handshaking lemma states that the sum of all vertex degrees is equal to twice the number of edges. So, sum of degrees is 20 times 3, which is 60, and number of edges is 60 divided by 2, which is 30. That matches what I thought earlier.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe considering that some students might be friends with the same set of friends, but in this case, since each student has exactly 3 friends, and friendships are mutual, I think the calculation holds.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another small example. Suppose there are 6 students, each with 3 friends. According to the same logic, it would be (6 times 3)/2 = 9 friendships. Is that possible? Yes, for example, you could have two separate triangles: A-B-C and D-E-F, where each triangle forms a complete subgraph with 3 edges each, totaling 6 edges. Wait, that's only 6 friendships, not 9. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the friendships are interconnected in a different way. For instance, you could have a cycle where each student is friends with the next two students in the cycle, ensuring each has 3 friends. But in that case, the total number of friendships should still be (number of students times number of friends per student) divided by 2.\n\nWait, perhaps my small example with 6 students is not accurate for this specific scenario. Let me think again.\n\nIn the case of 6 students each with 3 friends, perhaps the correct number of friendships is indeed 9. For example, you could have a complete graph on 4 students, where each has 3 friends, but that would require each of the 4 students to be friends with 3 others, which would result in 6 friendships (since 4*3/2=6). But the remaining 2 students would each need to have 3 friends, which would require connections to the first 4, but that might not hold consistently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe such a configuration isn't possible with 6 students, which suggests that for certain numbers of students and friendship degrees, there might be constraints based on graph theory.\n\nBut in the original problem, with 20 students each having 3 friends, it seems feasible, and the calculation of 30 friendships appears correct.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations, such as multiple friendships between the same pair of students, but the problem states that each student has exactly 3 friends, meaning single, unique friendships.\n\nAlso, assuming that friendships are mutual and non-directional, which is typical in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the number of friendships among the 20 students, each having exactly 3 friends, is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
