        "content": "First, I need to figure out how many apple trees can be planted on 25 acres of land, given that each tree needs 100 square feet of space. Okay, so acres and square feet are both units of area, but they're different sizes, so I need to convert acres to square feet to make the units match.\n\nI remember that one acre is equal to 43,560 square feet. So, if the farmer has 25 acres, I can calculate the total area in square feet by multiplying 25 by 43,560.\n\nLet me do that: 25 acres * 43,560 square feet per acre equals... let's see, 25 times 40,000 is 1,000,000, and 25 times 3,560 is 89,000. So, 1,000,000 plus 89,000 is 1,089,000 square feet.\n\nNow, each apple tree requires 100 square feet. To find out how many trees can be planted, I need to divide the total area by the area needed per tree. So, 1,089,000 square feet divided by 100 square feet per tree.\n\nThat's 1,089,000 divided by 100. Well, dividing by 100 is the same as moving the decimal point two places to the left. So, 1,089,000 becomes 10,890.\n\nTherefore, the farmer can plant 10,890 apple trees on his 25 acres of land.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, confirming the conversion factor: yes, one acre is indeed 43,560 square feet.\n\nThen, 25 acres times 43,560 square feet per acre: 25 * 43,560 = 1,089,000 square feet. That seems correct.\n\nNext, dividing the total area by the area per tree: 1,089,000 / 100 = 10,890 trees. That also seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer: the farmer can plant 10,890 apple trees on his land.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10890} \\]"
