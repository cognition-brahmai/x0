Each phase should match with an evidence value, which is the return of one of the usable functions given an input string that can be the user question, earlier evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nYou can use these tools:\nInfoSeek[input]: Allows the user to search for information from a broad database of resources. Useful for gathering diverse information.\nDataHarvester[input]: Loads one or multiple websites from the input string featuring newline separated links, where input includes one or more links, and gives plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkRetriever[input]: Retrieves links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline separated response of links.\nQueryHandler[input]: A question-answering language model, effective for handling queries based on an input text passage. The input must be a text question indicating an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the height of Mount Everest, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should follow this layout:\nPlan: [initial action to perform based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to apply with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action to perform, based on the effect of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to apply and input parameter, which may suggest previous evidence, e.g., \"Bearing in mind context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the conclusive answer.]\n\nQuestion: How did the Industrial Revolution impact society and economy?"
