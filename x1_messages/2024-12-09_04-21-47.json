        "content": "I'm happy to help you with that! To create a Python script that scrapes weather data from OpenWeatherMap using its API, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap:**\n   - Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account.\n   - Once you have an account, navigate to the API section and get an API key.\n\n2. **Install necessary Python libraries:**\n   - You'll need the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n   - If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install requests\n     ```\n\n3. **Write the Python script:**\n   - Import the necessary libraries.\n   - Prompt the user to enter the name of the city.\n   - Make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name and your API key.\n   - Parse the JSON response to extract the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed.\n   - Display the extracted data to the user.\n\nHere's a sample Python script that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather_data(city_name, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city_name,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        main = data['main']\n        wind = data['wind']\n        temperature = main['temp']\n        humidity = main['humidity']\n        wind_speed = wind['speed']\n        return temperature, humidity, wind_speed\n    else:\n        print(\"Error fetching data. Please check the city name and API key.\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    city_name = input(\"Enter the name of the city: \")\n    api_key = \"your_api_key_here\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n    weather_data = get_weather_data(city_name, api_key)\n    if weather_data:\n        temperature, humidity, wind_speed = weather_data\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **get_weather_data function:**\n   - This function takes the city name and API key as inputs.\n   - It constructs the API URL with the necessary parameters.\n   - It makes a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n   - If the request is successful (status code 200), it parses the JSON response to extract temperature, humidity, and wind speed.\n   - If there's an error, it prints an error message.\n\n2. **main function:**\n   - Prompts the user to enter the name of the city.\n   - Calls the `get_weather_data` function with the user-provided city name and API key.\n   - Prints the extracted weather data.\n\n3. **Running the script:**\n   - Ensure you have the `requests` library installed.\n   - Replace `\"your_api_key_here\"` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n   - Run the script, and enter the name of the city when prompted.\n\nThis script provides a simple way to fetch and display current weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API."
