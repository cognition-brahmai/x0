        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Node.js application that fetches the current weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly format. Let's break this down into steps.\n\nFirst, you'll need to sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap. It's free, and you'll need it to make requests to their API.\n\nOnce you have your API key, you can start building your Node.js application. You'll need to install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from nodejs.org.\n\nNext, create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` in your terminal. This will create a `package.json` file where you can manage your project's dependencies.\n\nNow, you'll need to install the `axios` package, which will help you make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. You can install it by running `npm install axios`.\n\nAfter that, create a new JavaScript file, let's say `weather.js`, and require the `axios` package at the top:\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\n```\n\nNow, you'll need to define a function that takes a city name as input, makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and returns the weather data. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getWeather(city) {\n  const apiKey = 'your_api_key_here';\n  const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}&units=metric`;\n\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.get(url);\n    return response.data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key.\n\nNow, you can call this function and display the weather information in a user-friendly format. For example:\n\n```javascript\nasync function displayWeather(city) {\n  const data = await getWeather(city);\n\n  if (data) {\n    console.log(`Weather in ${data.name}, ${data.sys.country}:`);\n    console.log(`Temperature: ${data.main.temp}\u00b0C`);\n    console.log(`Weather: ${data.weather[0].description}`);\n    console.log(`Humidity: ${data.main.humidity}%`);\n    console.log(`Wind speed: ${data.wind.speed} m/s`);\n  } else {\n    console.log('Unable to fetch weather data.');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, you can prompt the user to enter a city name and call the `displayWeather` function with that city. You can use the `readline` module for this:\n\n```javascript\nconst readline = require('readline').createInterface({\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout\n});\n\nreadline.question('Enter the name of a city: ', city => {\n  displayWeather(city);\n  readline.close();\n});\n```\n\nPut all of this together in your `weather.js` file, and run it using `node weather.js` in your terminal. Enter a city name when prompted, and you should see the current weather information for that city.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple Node.js application that fetches and displays weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.\n\n**Full code:**\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\nconst readline = require('readline').createInterface({\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout\n});\n\nasync function getWeather(city) {\n  const apiKey = 'your_api_key_here';\n  const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}&units=metric`;\n\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.get(url);\n    return response.data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\nasync function displayWeather(city) {\n  const data = await getWeather(city);\n\n  if (data) {\n    console.log(`Weather in ${data.name}, ${data.sys.country}:`);\n    console.log(`Temperature: ${data.main.temp}\u00b0C`);\n    console.log(`Weather: ${data.weather[0].description}`);\n    console.log(`Humidity: ${data.main.humidity}%`);\n    console.log(`Wind speed: ${data.wind.speed} m/s`);\n  } else {\n    console.log('Unable to fetch weather data.');\n  }\n}\n\nreadline.question('Enter the name of a city: ', city => {\n  displayWeather(city);\n  readline.close();\n});\n```\n\n**Note:** Remember to replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n- You can enhance this application by adding more features, such as handling multiple units (Celsius, Fahrenheit), providing forecasts for multiple days, or adding error handling for invalid city names.\n\n- Consider using environment variables to store your API key instead of hardcoding it in your script for better security.\n\n- You can also create a command-line interface (CLI) tool using packages like `yargs` or `commander` to make your application more user-friendly.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
