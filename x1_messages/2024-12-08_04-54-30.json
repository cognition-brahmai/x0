        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is (6^2 / 3) * (5 - 2)^3. Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations. I think it's PEMDAS or something like that. Parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses. There are two sets here: (6^2 / 3) and (5 - 2)^3. I'll handle each one separately.\n\nFirst, (5 - 2)^3. That's straightforward. 5 minus 2 is 3, so it's 3^3. 3 cubed is 27. So, that part simplifies to 27.\n\nNow, the other part: (6^2 / 3). So, 6 squared is 36, and then divided by 3. 36 divided by 3 is 12. So, that simplifies to 12.\n\nNow, I have 12 * 27. Okay, what's 12 times 27? Let me see. 10 times 27 is 270, and 2 times 27 is 54. So, 270 plus 54 is 324.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. 12 times 25 is 300, and 12 times 2 is 24, so 300 plus 24 is 324. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 324.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through it again.\n\nFirst, (6^2 / 3). 6 squared is 36, divided by 3 is 12. Okay, that's good.\n\nNext, (5 - 2)^3. 5 minus 2 is 3, and 3 cubed is 27. That's fine.\n\nThen, 12 multiplied by 27. 12 times 20 is 240, and 12 times 7 is 84. 240 plus 84 is 324. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, I'm confident the answer is 324.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{324} \\]"
