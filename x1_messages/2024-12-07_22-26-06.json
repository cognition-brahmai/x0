        "content": "Certainly! Below is an example of a TypeScript class for a \"Car\" object with the specified properties and methods:\n\n```typescript\nclass Car {\n    make: string;\n    model: string;\n    year: number;\n    color: string;\n    engineOn: boolean;\n    speed: number;\n\n    constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number, color: string) {\n        this.make = make;\n        this.model = model;\n        this.year = year;\n        this.color = color;\n        this.engineOn = false;\n        this.speed = 0;\n    }\n\n    startEngine(): void {\n        if (!this.engineOn) {\n            this.engineOn = true;\n            console.log(\"Engine started.\");\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Engine is already running.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    stopEngine(): void {\n        if (this.engineOn) {\n            this.engineOn = false;\n            this.speed = 0;\n            console.log(\"Engine stopped.\");\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Engine is already stopped.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    accelerate(amount: number): void {\n        if (this.engineOn) {\n            this.speed += amount;\n            console.log(`Accelerated by ${amount} km/h. Current speed: ${this.speed} km/h.`);\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Cannot accelerate. Engine is not running.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    decelerate(amount: number): void {\n        if (this.engineOn) {\n            this.speed = Math.max(this.speed - amount, 0);\n            console.log(`Decelerated by ${amount} km/h. Current speed: ${this.speed} km/h.`);\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Cannot decelerate. Engine is not running.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): void {\n        console.log(`Make: ${this.make}`);\n        console.log(`Model: ${this.model}`);\n        console.log(`Year: ${this.year}`);\n        console.log(`Color: ${this.color}`);\n        console.log(`Engine: ${this.engineOn ? 'On' : 'Off'}`);\n        console.log(`Speed: ${this.speed} km/h`);\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst myCar = new Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2020, \"Blue\");\nmyCar.displayInfo();\nmyCar.startEngine();\nmyCar.accelerate(50);\nmyCar.decelerate(20);\nmyCar.stopEngine();\nmyCar.displayInfo();\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Properties:**\n   - `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`: These store the basic information about the car.\n   - `engineOn`: A boolean to track whether the engine is running.\n   - `speed`: An integer to represent the current speed of the car in km/h.\n\n2. **Constructor:**\n   - Initializes the car's properties with the provided values.\n   - Sets `engineOn` to `false` and `speed` to `0` by default.\n\n3. **Methods:**\n   - `startEngine()`: Starts the car's engine if it's not already running.\n   - `stopEngine()`: Stops the car's engine and resets the speed to 0 if the engine is running.\n   - `accelerate(amount)`: Increases the car's speed by the specified amount if the engine is on.\n   - `decelerate(amount)`: Decreases the car's speed by the specified amount (down to 0) if the engine is on.\n   - `displayInfo()`: Prints out all the current information about the car.\n\nThis class provides a simple simulation of a car's basic operations and can be extended with more features as needed."
