The expression is:\n\n(3^2 * 4) / (6 - 2) + 5 * (7 - 3)\n\nFirst, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n(6 - 2) = 4\n\n(7 - 3) = 4\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(3^2 * 4) / 4 + 5 * 4\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(9 * 4) / 4 + 5 * 4\n\nNow, multiplication and division from left to right:\n\n9 * 4 = 36\n\n36 / 4 = 9\n\nAnd 5 * 4 = 20\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n9 + 20\n\nFinally, addition:\n\n9 + 20 = 29\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{29} \\]"
