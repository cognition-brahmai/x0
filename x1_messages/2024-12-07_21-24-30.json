It's renowned for its vast plains and the annual migration of over a million wildebeest and hundreds of thousands of zebra and Thomson's gazelles, following the rains in search of fresh grazing lands. This natural phenomenon is one of the largest and most spectacular mass migrations on Earth, attracting tourists from around the world to witness the cycle of life in action."
