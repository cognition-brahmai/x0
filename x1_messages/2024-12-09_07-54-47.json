        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 6 red balls and 4 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 10 balls. The question is, what's the probability of drawing 2 red balls in a row without replacing the first one back into the bag.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's going on here. Probability is all about finding the chance of something happening, right? So, in this case, the chance of drawing two red balls one after the other without putting the first one back.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. When I draw the first ball, there are 10 balls in total, and 6 of them are red. So, the probability of drawing a red ball first is 6 out of 10, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nNow, since I'm not replacing the first ball, that means after I draw the first red ball, there are now 9 balls left in the bag. And since I took one red ball out, there are now 5 red balls and 4 blue balls remaining.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a second red ball is now 5 out of 9.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening one after the other, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the overall probability should be (3/5) * (5/9).\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 3/5 times 5/9.\n\nMultiply the numerators: 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nMultiply the denominators: 5 * 9 = 45.\n\nSo, 15/45, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about combinations. The total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 10 is \u201c10 choose 2,\u201d which is (10*9)/2 = 45.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 6 is \u201c6 choose 2,\u201d which is (6*5)/2 = 15.\n\nSo, the probability is 15/45, which is again 1/3.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using probabilities without simplifying steps.\n\nProbability of first red ball: 6/10.\n\nProbability of second red ball without replacement: 5/9.\n\nMultiply them: (6/10)*(5/9) = (6*5)/(10*9) = 30/90 = 1/3.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I\u2019ve confirmed it enough. The probability is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
