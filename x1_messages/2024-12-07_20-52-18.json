        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about probabilities with candies. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a jar with different colored candies: 4 red, 3 green, and 2 blue. So, in total, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 candies in the jar.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability of picking a green candy without looking. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is picking a green candy. There are 3 green candies. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of candies, which is 9.\n\nSo, the probability P of picking a green candy should be P = number of green candies / total number of candies = 3/9.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3, which gives me 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a green candy is 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using permutations or combinations?\n\nWell, since we're just picking one candy without replacement, and the order doesn't matter, the basic probability approach should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the number of green candies divided by the total number of candies, which is what I did.\n\nSo, I think 1/3 is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this probability. For example, are the candies different sizes or shapes that might affect the chance of picking one color over another? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume all candies are identical except for their color.\n\nAlso, it says \"without looking,\" which means that the selection is random, so no bias towards any color.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is that the probability is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
