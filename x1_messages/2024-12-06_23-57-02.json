        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a new sports complex. It's going to have a big stadium, an indoor arena, and some outdoor fields. Let me see what exactly it's asking for.\n\nFirst, it says the stadium has a seating capacity of 50,000 people. That's a huge stadium! Then there's an indoor arena that can accommodate 10,000 spectators. That's also pretty big. And finally, there are multiple outdoor fields that can host up to 5,000 visitors at a time. So, I need to calculate the total seating capacity of the entire sports complex.\n\nAlright, so total seating capacity would just be the sum of all the individual seating areas, right? So, stadium seats plus indoor arena seats plus outdoor field seats.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal seating capacity = stadium seats + indoor arena seats + outdoor field seats\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal seating capacity = 50,000 + 10,000 + 5,000 = 65,000 seats\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNext, it asks to estimate the cost of constructing the facilities. It gives the cost per seat for each part: $500 for the stadium, $800 for the indoor arena, and $300 for the outdoor fields.\n\nSo, to find the total construction cost, I need to multiply the number of seats by the cost per seat for each facility and then add them all up.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nCost for stadium = stadium seats \u00d7 cost per stadium seat\n\nCost for indoor arena = indoor arena seats \u00d7 cost per indoor arena seat\n\nCost for outdoor fields = outdoor field seats \u00d7 cost per outdoor field seat\n\nThen, total construction cost = cost for stadium + cost for indoor arena + cost for outdoor fields\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nCost for stadium = 50,000 \u00d7 500 = 25,000,000\n\nCost for indoor arena = 10,000 \u00d7 800 = 8,000,000\n\nCost for outdoor fields = 5,000 \u00d7 300 = 1,500,000\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nTotal construction cost = 25,000,000 + 8,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 34,500,000\n\nSo, the total estimated construction cost would be $34,500,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that sound reasonable? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, stadium: 50,000 seats \u00d7 $500 per seat.\n\n50,000 \u00d7 500 = 25,000,000. That seems correct.\n\nIndoor arena: 10,000 seats \u00d7 $800 per seat.\n\n10,000 \u00d7 800 = 8,000,000. That's right.\n\nOutdoor fields: 5,000 seats \u00d7 $300 per seat.\n\n5,000 \u00d7 300 = 1,500,000. Correct.\n\nTotal cost: 25,000,000 + 8,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 34,500,000. Yep.\n\nAlright, so the total seating capacity is 65,000 and the estimated construction cost is $34,500,000.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other costs involved, like land acquisition, utilities, maintenance, etc. But the problem specifically asks for the cost of constructing the facilities based on the cost per seat for each part, so I think sticking to that is fine.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The cost per seat is given in dollars, and the total cost comes out in dollars, which is good.\n\nSo, final answer: total seating capacity is 65,000, and the estimated construction cost is $34,500,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65000 \\text{ seats}, \\$34,500,000} \\]"
