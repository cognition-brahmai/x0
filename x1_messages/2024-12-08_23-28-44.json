However, in terms of chemical composition, coffee beans contain various compounds that contribute to their bitterness, such as caffeine, chlorogenic acids, and trigonelline. The bitterness can vary depending on how the coffee is roasted and brewed.\n\nSome people might perceive the outer layer of the coffee bean, called the silverskin, as more bitter, but it's usually removed during processing. In general, the bitterness in coffee comes from the combination of these compounds, and it's not localized to one specific part of the bean. If you have any other questions about coffee or anything else, feel free to ask!"
