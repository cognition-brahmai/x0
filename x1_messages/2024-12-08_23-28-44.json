The game involves resource management, trading, and strategic development.\n\nPlayers collect resources by settling near production locations on a hexagonal game board that is randomly generated at the start of each game. The five primary resources in the game are brick, lumber, wool, grain, and ore.

It has also inspired several expansions and spin-off games that add new elements and variations to the original gameplay."
