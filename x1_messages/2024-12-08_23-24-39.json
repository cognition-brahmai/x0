        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"A farmer has 15 sheep and all but 8 die. How many are left?\" Hmm, let's see. At first glance, it seems straightforward. If the farmer starts with 15 sheep and all but 8 die, that means 8 sheep survive. So, the answer should be 8, right?\n\nBut wait, let's think about this a bit more. The phrase \"all but 8 die\" could be interpreted in different ways. Maybe there's a trick here. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, \"all but 8 die\" means that all the sheep except for 8 die. So, out of the 15 sheep, some die and some don't. The ones that don't die are the 8 that are left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"all but 8\" refers to something else. For example, perhaps it's not just about the sheep dying, but maybe some are sold or taken away. But the problem specifically says \"all but 8 die,\" so I think the straightforward interpretation is correct.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If all but 8 die, that means 8 survive. So, the number of sheep left is 8.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is trying to be tricky by using the word \"left.\" Perhaps it's referring to the remaining sheep in terms of their position or something. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the farmer has other animals, and the problem is considering them as well. But the problem specifically mentions sheep, so I think we can focus solely on the sheep.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps some of the sheep that die are still present on the farm, and the problem is asking how many sheep are left in terms of bodies or something. But again, the problem seems to be straightforward, asking for how many sheep are left alive.\n\nLet me try rephrasing the problem to see if that helps. If a farmer has 15 sheep and all but 8 die, how many sheep remain alive? Yes, that makes it clear: 8 sheep remain alive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing understanding of the phrase \"all but.\" \"All but 8\" means \"all except for 8.\" So, if all except for 8 die, then those 8 are the ones that don't die.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. The answer seems straightforward: 8 sheep are left.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation. For example, maybe the \"all but 8\" refers to the number that die, not the number that survive. But that wouldn't make sense because \"all but 8 die\" clearly means that 8 do not die.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a language trick here. Is \"all but 8\" ambiguous? In this context, it's standard to interpret it as \"all except for 8.\"\n\nAnother angle: maybe the farmer has other animals, but the problem specifies sheep, so that shouldn't affect the answer.\n\nPerhaps the problem is testing basic subtraction skills: 15 minus something equals 8. Wait, but that would be 15 - 7 = 8, which isn't directly relevant here.\n\nNo, the key is understanding the phrase \"all but 8 die.\" This means that all sheep except for 8 die, so 8 sheep survive.\n\nTherefore, the number of sheep left is 8.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. It's a straightforward problem once you parse the language correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
