        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Python script that accepts two numbers as command-line arguments and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using Euclid's algorithm.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n\nCreate a new Python file, for example, `gcd.py`, and open it in a text editor.\n\nCopy and paste the following code into the file:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if len(sys.argv) != 3:\n        print(\"Usage: python gcd.py <number1> <number2>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    try:\n        num1 = int(sys.argv[1])\n        num2 = int(sys.argv[2])\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Both arguments must be integers.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    result = gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {result}\")\n```\n\nSave the file and close the text editor.\n\nTo run the script, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the following command:\n\n```\npython gcd.py 48 18\n```\n\nReplace `48` and `18` with any two integers you want to find the GCD for.\n\nThe script will output the GCD of the two numbers.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Importing the `sys` module**: This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.\n\n2. **Defining the `gcd` function**: This function implements Euclid's algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers. It repeatedly replaces the larger number by the remainder of the division of the two numbers until one of them becomes zero. The non-zero remainder at this point is the GCD.\n\n3. **Checking command-line arguments**: The script checks if exactly two arguments are provided. If not, it prints the correct usage and exits.\n\n4. **Converting arguments to integers**: It attempts to convert the command-line arguments to integers. If this fails, it prints an error message and exits.\n\n5. **Calculating and printing the GCD**: It computes the GCD using the `gcd` function and prints the result.\n\nThis script is a straightforward way to compute the GCD of two numbers using command-line arguments in Python."
