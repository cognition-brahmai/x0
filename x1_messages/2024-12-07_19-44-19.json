        "content": "So, the car rental company has 100 cars, and on average, 75% of them are rented out each day. We want to find out how many days it will take for the company to reach 10,000 rentals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"75% of them are rented out each day\" means. Does this mean that 75% of the total cars are rented each day, or that each day, 75% of the possible rentals occur?\n\nWait, no. It says \"75% of them are rented out each day,\" and \"them\" refers to the 100 cars. So, each day, 75% of the 100 cars are rented.\n\nSo, daily rentals = 75% of 100 cars.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n75% of 100 = 0.75 * 100 = 75 cars per day.\n\nSo, the company rents out 75 cars each day.\n\nNow, we need to reach a total of 10,000 rentals.\n\nTo find the number of days required, we can divide the total rentals needed by the daily rentals.\n\nSo, number of days = total rentals / daily rentals = 10,000 / 75.\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n10,000 divided by 75.\n\nLet's see, 75 times 100 is 7,500.\n\nSubtract that from 10,000: 10,000 - 7,500 = 2,500.\n\nNow, 75 times 33 is 2,475.\n\nSo, 100 days plus 33 days is 133 days.\n\nBut 75 times 133 is 75 * 133.\n\nWait, let me calculate 75 * 133.\n\n75 * 100 = 7,500\n\n75 * 30 = 2,250\n\n75 * 3 = 225\n\nTotal: 7,500 + 2,250 = 9,750 + 225 = 9,975.\n\nSo, after 133 days, they have 9,975 rentals.\n\nThey need 10,000, so they need 25 more rentals.\n\nSince they rent 75 cars per day, the next day they will reach 10,025 rentals.\n\nTherefore, it will take 134 days to reach at least 10,000 rentals.\n\nWait, but that seems off because on day 134, they would have 9,975 + 75 = 10,050, which is more than 10,000.\n\nBut if we consider that they reach 10,000 sometime during day 134, maybe before the end of the day.\n\nBut since the question is about full days, we can consider it takes 134 days to reach at least 10,000 rentals.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate it more precisely.\n\nTotal rentals needed: 10,000.\n\nDaily rentals: 75.\n\nNumber of days = 10,000 / 75.\n\nLet's do the division: 10,000 \u00f7 75.\n\nCalculating 10,000 \u00f7 75.\n\n75 times 133 is 9,975, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 10,000 - 9,975 = 25.\n\nTherefore, on day 134, they rent out 75 cars, which would take the total from 9,975 to 10,050, which exceeds 10,000.\n\nSo, it takes 134 days to reach at least 10,000 rentals.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to find the exact day when they reach exactly 10,000, we can set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s let d be the number of days.\n\nThen, total rentals = 75 * d.\n\nWe set this equal to 10,000:\n\n75d = 10,000.\n\nSolving for d: d = 10,000 / 75.\n\nCalculating that: 10,000 \u00f7 75.\n\nLet me divide 10,000 by 75.\n\n75 times 133 is 9,975.\n\nSubtracting: 10,000 - 9,975 = 25.\n\nSo, 75 * 133 = 9,975.\n\nTo get to 10,000, we need an additional 25 rentals.\n\nSince each day provides 75 rentals, the fraction of the day needed is 25 / 75 = 1/3 of a day.\n\nTherefore, total days = 133 + 1/3 days.\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a day in this context, we round up to the next whole day, which is 134 days.\n\nSo, it will take 134 days for the company to reach 10,000 rentals.\n\nWait a minute, but perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nIf the company rents out 75 cars per day, and we need to reach 10,000 rentals, then the number of days is 10,000 divided by 75.\n\n10,000 \u00f7 75 = 133.333... days.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a day, and they rent 75 cars per full day, we need to round up to 134 days to reach at least 10,000 rentals.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that on the 134th day, they would reach 10,050 rentals, which is over 10,000, but if we want exactly 10,000, perhaps we can consider it's achieved sometime during the 134th day.\n\nBut in practical terms, since they rent out cars in full days, it would be 134 days to reach at least 10,000 rentals.\n\nSo, the answer is 134 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{134} \\]"
