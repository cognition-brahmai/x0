        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a company with 20 employees\u201412 men and 8 women. They want to form a committee of 5 people, and this committee must have at least 2 women. I need to figure out how many ways this can be done.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to calculate combinations because the order in which we select the committee members doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 from 20 employees without any restrictions would be C(20, 5). But here, there's a condition: the committee must have at least 2 women.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the total number of possible committees and then subtract the number of committees that don't meet the condition, i.e., committees with fewer than 2 women.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate directly the number of committees with at least 2 women by considering different cases: committees with exactly 2 women, exactly 3 women, exactly 4 women, and exactly 5 women.\n\nLet me try both approaches to see which one is easier.\n\nFirst approach: total committees minus committees with fewer than 2 women.\n\nTotal committees: C(20, 5).\n\nCommittees with fewer than 2 women mean committees with 0 women or 1 woman.\n\nSo, committees with 0 women: that's selecting all 5 members from the 12 men, which is C(12, 5).\n\nCommittees with 1 woman: selecting 1 woman from 8 and 4 men from 12, which is C(8, 1) * C(12, 4).\n\nTherefore, the number of committees with at least 2 women is C(20, 5) - [C(12, 5) + C(8, 1) * C(12, 4)].\n\nLet me calculate these values.\n\nFirst, C(20, 5) = 20! / (5! * 15!) = (20*19*18*17*16) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 15504.\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * 7!) = (12*11*10*9*8) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 792.\n\nC(8, 1) = 8.\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = (12*11*10*9) / (4*3*2*1) = 495.\n\nSo, C(8, 1) * C(12, 4) = 8 * 495 = 3960.\n\nTherefore, the number of committees with at least 2 women is 15504 - (792 + 3960) = 15504 - 4752 = 10752.\n\nNow, let's try the second approach: adding up the committees with exactly 2, 3, 4, and 5 women.\n\nCommittees with exactly 2 women: C(8, 2) * C(12, 3).\n\nC(8, 2) = (8*7)/(2*1) = 28.\n\nC(12, 3) = (12*11*10)/(3*2*1) = 220.\n\nSo, 28 * 220 = 6160.\n\nCommittees with exactly 3 women: C(8, 3) * C(12, 2).\n\nC(8, 3) = (8*7*6)/(3*2*1) = 56.\n\nC(12, 2) = (12*11)/(2*1) = 66.\n\nSo, 56 * 66 = 3696.\n\nCommittees with exactly 4 women: C(8, 4) * C(12, 1).\n\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2*1) = 70.\n\nC(12, 1) = 12.\n\nSo, 70 * 12 = 840.\n\nCommittees with exactly 5 women: C(8, 5) * C(12, 0).\n\nC(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = 56 (since C(n, k) = C(n, n-k)).\n\nC(12, 0) = 1.\n\nSo, 56 * 1 = 56.\n\nNow, adding these up: 6160 + 3696 = 9856; 9856 + 840 = 10696; 10696 + 56 = 10752.\n\nWait, that's the same result as in the first approach: 10752.\n\nGood, both approaches give the same answer, which reassures me that I'm on the right track.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst approach:\n\nC(20, 5) = 15504.\n\nC(12, 5) = 792.\n\nC(8, 1) * C(12, 4) = 8 * 495 = 3960.\n\nTotal to subtract: 792 + 3960 = 4752.\n\n15504 - 4752 = 10752.\n\nSecond approach:\n\nC(8, 2)*C(12, 3) = 28*220 = 6160.\n\nC(8, 3)*C(12, 2) = 56*66 = 3696.\n\nC(8, 4)*C(12, 1) = 70*12 = 840.\n\nC(8, 5)*C(12, 0) = 56*1 = 56.\n\nTotal: 6160 + 3696 = 9856; 9856 + 840 = 10696; 10696 + 56 = 10752.\n\nYes, both methods confirm the answer is 10752.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to form a committee of 5 people with at least 2 women is 10752.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10752} \\]"
