        "content": "Reversing a singly linked list without using any additional data structures can be achieved by iteratively changing the pointers of each node so that they point to the previous node instead of the next one. Here's how you can do it in JavaScript:\n\nFirst, define a simple `ListNode` class to represent the nodes of the linked list:\n\n```javascript\nclass ListNode {\n  constructor(value) {\n    this.value = value;\n    this.next = null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNext, create the function to reverse the linked list:\n\n```javascript\nfunction reverseLinkedList(head) {\n  let previous = null;\n  let current = head;\n\n  while (current !== null) {\n    // Store the next node\n    const next = current.next;\n\n    // Reverse the current node's pointer\n    current.next = previous;\n\n    // Move pointers one position ahead\n    previous = current;\n    current = next;\n  }\n\n  // The new head is the last node we processed\n  return previous;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `previous` is initialized to `null` because initially, there are no nodes before the head.\n   - `current` is set to the head of the list.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - While `current` is not `null`, store the next node in a variable called `next`.\n   - Reverse the `next` pointer of the current node to point to `previous`.\n   - Move `previous` to be the current node.\n   - Move `current` to the next node stored earlier.\n\n3. **Return the new head:**\n   - After the loop, `previous` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.\n\nThis approach ensures that you reverse the list in-place without using any extra space for another data structure, fulfilling the requirement.\n"
