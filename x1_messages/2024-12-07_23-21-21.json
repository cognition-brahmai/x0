Here's a C++ function that takes a pointer to an integer array and its length as input and reverses the order of the elements in the array:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid reverseArray(int* arr, int length) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < length / 2; ++i) {\n        int temp = arr[i];\n        arr[i] = arr[length - 1 - i];\n        arr[length - 1 - i] = temp;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    int length = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n\n    std::cout << \"Original array: \";\n    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {\n        std::cout << arr[i] << \" \";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    reverseArray(arr, length);\n\n    std::cout << \"Reversed array: \";\n    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {\n        std::cout << arr[i] << \" \";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `reverseArray` function takes a pointer to the first element of the array and the length of the array. It then iterates from the start to the midpoint of the array, swapping elements symmetrically from the start and end moving towards the center.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use the `reverseArray` function by creating an array, printing it, reversing it, and then printing it again to show the reversed order.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!"
