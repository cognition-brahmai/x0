        "content": "Let's see. There are 120 employees in total. 30% work in marketing, 40% in sales, and the remaining work in administration. I need to find out how many work in each department.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of employees in marketing. 30% of 120 should give me that number. So, 30% of 120 is 0.3 times 120, which is 36 employees in marketing.\n\nNext, for sales, it's 40% of 120. So, 0.4 times 120 equals 48 employees in sales.\n\nNow, for administration, it's the rest of the employees. Since marketing and sales together take up 30% plus 40%, which is 70%, the administration must have 30% of the employees. Wait, that doesn't add up because 30% plus 40% is 70%, so the rest should be 30%. But let me confirm that.\n\nTotal percentage should be 100%. So, marketing is 30%, sales is 40%, and administration is 100% minus 70%, which is 30%. Okay, so administration also has 30% of the employees.\n\nNow, 30% of 120 is the same as marketing, which is 36 employees.\n\nWait a minute, but that doesn't seem right because sales has 40%, which is higher, and marketing and administration both have 30%. So, numbers should reflect that.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nMarketing: 30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 employees.\n\nSales: 40% of 120 = 0.4 * 120 = 48 employees.\n\nAdministration: 100% - 70% = 30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 employees.\n\nHmm, so according to this, marketing and administration have the same number of employees, which is 36 each, and sales has more with 48 employees.\n\nLet me just verify if the percentages add up correctly.\n\n30% (marketing) + 40% (sales) + 30% (administration) = 100%.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of employees in each department is:\n\n- Marketing: 36 employees\n\n- Sales: 48 employees\n\n- Administration: 36 employees\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Marketing: 36, Sales: 48, Administration: 36}} \\]"
