        "content": "Let's see. So there are three people: A, B, and C. Each of them is either a truth-teller or a liar, meaning they always tell the truth or always lie, respectively. We need to figure out who is lying based on their statements.\n\nFirst, Person A says, \"I am a liar.\" Hmm, that's interesting. If A is a truth-teller, then saying \"I am a liar\" would be a lie, which contradicts the fact that they always tell the truth. On the other hand, if A is a liar, then saying \"I am a liar\" would be the truth, but that contradicts the fact that they always lie. This seems like a paradox. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps in this context, \"liar\" refers to someone who always lies, not just someone who is lying in that particular statement. So if A is a truth-teller, saying \"I am a liar\" would be false, which aligns with them always telling the truth. But if A is a liar, saying \"I am a liar\" would be true, which contradicts their nature of always lying. So, perhaps A must be a truth-teller, even though the statement seems paradoxical.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n- If A is a truth-teller, then \"I am a liar\" is false, which makes sense.\n\n- If A is a liar, then \"I am a liar\" is true, which can't be, because liars always lie.\n\nTherefore, A must be a truth-teller.\n\nOkay, moving on to Person B. B says, \"Person A is telling the truth.\" Well, we've just determined that A is a truth-teller, so A is indeed telling the truth. Therefore, B's statement is true. If B is telling the truth, then B must be a truth-teller. Alternatively, if B were a liar, then their statement would be false, but we know that A is telling the truth, so B's statement is true, meaning B can't be a liar. Therefore, B is a truth-teller.\n\nNow, Person C says, \"Person B is lying.\" But we've just established that B is a truth-teller, so B is not lying. Therefore, C's statement is false. If C is stating that B is lying, but B is actually telling the truth, then C is lying. Therefore, C must be a liar.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: truth-teller\n\n- B: truth-teller\n\n- C: liar\n\nSo, the person who must be lying is C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If C is a liar and always lies, then when C says \"Person B is lying,\" that statement is false, meaning B is not lying, which aligns with our earlier conclusion that B is a truth-teller. Everything seems consistent.\n\nI think that's the solution. Only C is lying.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
