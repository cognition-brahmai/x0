        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field with an area of 450 square meters. The length is 5 meters more than twice its width. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width of the field.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if we denote the width by \\( w \\) meters, then the length would be \\( 2w + 5 \\) meters, according to the problem.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = \\text{area}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions we have:\n\n\\[\n(2w + 5) \\times w = 450\n\\]\n\nLet's expand this equation:\n\n\\[\n2w^2 + 5w = 450\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( w \\), we need to rearrange this equation into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n2w^2 + 5w - 450 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula, which is:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nIn our equation, \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 5 \\), and \\( c = -450 \\). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times (-450)}}{2 \\times 2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 3600}}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{3625}}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-5 \\pm 60.208}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two potential solutions for \\( w \\):\n\n1. \\( w = \\frac{-5 + 60.208}{4} \\)\n\n2. \\( w = \\frac{-5 - 60.208}{4} \\)\n\nLet's calculate the first one:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{55.208}{4} = 13.802 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nAnd the second one:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-65.208}{4} = -16.302 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSince a width cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the width of the field is approximately 13.802 meters.\n\nNow, let's find the length using the expression \\( l = 2w + 5 \\):\n\n\\[\nl = 2 \\times 13.802 + 5 = 27.604 + 5 = 32.604 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, the dimensions of the field are approximately 13.802 meters in width and 32.604 meters in length.\n\nTo verify, we can calculate the area with these dimensions:\n\n\\[\n13.802 \\times 32.604 \\approx 450.00 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given area, confirming our solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the field are \\boxed{13.802 \\text{ meters in width and } 32.604 \\text{ meters in length}}."
