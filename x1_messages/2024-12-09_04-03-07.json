        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a bag with 12 marbles: 4 red, 4 blue, and 4 green. We're picking two marbles without replacement, and we want to find the probability that both marbles are the same color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I pick the first marble, I don't put it back into the bag before picking the second one. So, the total number of marbles decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nOkay, let's think about the total number of ways to pick two marbles out of 12. That's a combination problem, right? Because the order doesn't matter; I'm just choosing two marbles together, not one after the other in a specific order.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 marbles out of 12 is:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 10! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 possible pairs of marbles that can be picked.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the pairs where both marbles are the same color. There are three colors: red, blue, and green. So, we'll calculate the number of ways to pick two red marbles, two blue marbles, and two green marbles, and then add them up.\n\nLet's start with the red marbles. There are 4 red marbles, and we want to choose 2 of them:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to pick two red marbles.\n\nSimilarly, for the blue marbles:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = 6\n\\]\n\nAnd for the green marbles:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is:\n\n\\[\n6 + 6 + 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{same color}) = \\frac{18}{66}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 6:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{same color}) = \\frac{18 \\div 6}{66 \\div 6} = \\frac{3}{11}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability that both marbles are the same color is \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to pick 2 marbles out of 12 is indeed 66.\n\nThen, for each color, the number of ways to pick 2 marbles is 6, and since there are 3 colors, that's 18 favorable outcomes.\n\nDividing 18 by 66 gives \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\), which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red marble on the first draw is \\( \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} \\). Given that the first marble is red, the probability that the second marble is also red is \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\), since there are now 3 red marbles left out of 11 total marbles.\n\nSo, the probability of both marbles being red is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{1}{11}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the probability of both marbles being blue is also \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\), and the same for green.\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events (they can't happen at the same time), we can add their probabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{11} + \\frac{1}{11} + \\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{3}{11}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the earlier result, so I'm confident that \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\) is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the general formula for the probability of drawing two marbles of the same color without replacement.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{same color}) = \\frac{C(\\text{number of marbles of one color}, 2) \\times \\text{number of colors}}{C(\\text{total marbles}, 2)}\n\\]\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability without using combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick two marbles is 12 choices for the first marble and 11 for the second, but since order doesn't matter, we divide by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{total outcomes} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nFor same color:\n\n- For red: 4 choices for the first red marble and 3 for the second, divided by 2: \\( \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6 \\)\n\n- Same for blue and green: 6 each\n\n- Total favorable: 18\n\n- Probability: \\( \\frac{18}{66} = \\frac{3}{11} \\)\n\nAlternatively, considering the first marble can be any color, and then the second marble must match the first one's color.\n\nThe probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{same color}) = P(\\text{second matches first})\n\\]\n\nAfter picking the first marble, there are 11 marbles left, and 3 of them are the same color as the first one (since there are 4 marbles of each color, and one has already been picked).\n\nSo, the probability that the second marble matches the first one is \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\).\n\nThis is a simpler way to think about it and arrives at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{11}} \\]"
