        "content": "Let's see. There are four candidates in this election: A, B, C, and D. The percentages of votes they received are 40%, 30%, 20%, and the remaining votes for D. The total number of votes cast is 2,500. I need to find out how many more votes candidate A received compared to candidate D.\n\nFirst, I should find out the percentage of votes that candidate D received. Since the total percentage must add up to 100%, I can calculate D's percentage by subtracting the sum of A, B, and C's percentages from 100%.\n\nSo, A is 40%, B is 30%, and C is 20%. Adding those up: 40% + 30% + 20% = 90%. Therefore, D must have received 100% - 90% = 10% of the votes.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many votes each candidate received. Since the total number of votes is 2,500, I can calculate each candidate's vote count by multiplying their percentage by the total votes.\n\nFor candidate A: 40% of 2,500.\n\nTo calculate that: (40/100) * 2,500.\n\nSimilarly, for candidate D: 10% of 2,500, which is (10/100) * 2,500.\n\nThen, to find out how many more votes A received than D, I'll subtract D's vote count from A's vote count.\n\nLet me do the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate A's votes:\n\n(40/100) * 2,500 = (0.4) * 2,500 = 1,000 votes.\n\nNext, calculate D's votes:\n\n(10/100) * 2,500 = (0.1) * 2,500 = 250 votes.\n\nNow, subtract D's votes from A's votes:\n\n1,000 - 250 = 750 votes.\n\nSo, candidate A received 750 more votes than candidate D.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nA: 40% of 2,500:\n\n40% = 0.4\n\n0.4 * 2,500 = 1,000 votes. That seems correct.\n\nD: 10% of 2,500:\n\n10% = 0.1\n\n0.1 * 2,500 = 250 votes. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 1,000 - 250 = 750 votes. Yeah, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of percentages. A has 40% and D has 10%, so A has 30% more than D.\n\n30% of 2,500 is:\n\n(30/100) * 2,500 = 0.3 * 2,500 = 750 votes.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also check the votes for candidates B and C.\n\nB: 30% of 2,500:\n\n0.3 * 2,500 = 750 votes.\n\nC: 20% of 2,500:\n\n0.2 * 2,500 = 500 votes.\n\nNow, let's add up all the votes:\n\nA: 1,000\n\nB: 750\n\nC: 500\n\nD: 250\n\nTotal: 1,000 + 750 = 1,750; plus 500 is 2,250; plus 250 is 2,500. That matches the total votes cast, so everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, candidate A received 750 more votes than candidate D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{750} \\]"
