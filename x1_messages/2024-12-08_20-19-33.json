        "content": "I'm going to take a guess here. Central America has several countries known for their volcanic activity due to the tectonic settings in the region. Countries like Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica come to mind because they have active volcanoes. Now, the Masaya Volcano is something I've heard of, and I think it's in Nicaragua. So, I believe the answer is Nicaragua. But let me double-check.\n\nMasaya is indeed a volcanic caldera in Nicaragua, and it's known for its active volcano. In fact, the Masaya Volcano National Park is a popular tourist destination where you can see lava lakes sometimes. Nicaragua is famous for its volcanic formations; it has around 200 volcanic structures, although not all are active. Some of these volcanoes have created beautiful landscapes and even some of the country's fertile soils.\n\nSo, to confirm, the country you're referring to is Nicaragua, which is known for its over 200 volcanic formations, including the active Masaya Volcano. Is that correct?"
