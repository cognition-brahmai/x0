        "content": "So I've got this problem here about families owning dogs and cats. It says that 60% of families own a dog, 30% own a cat, and 20% own both a dog and a cat. I need to find out what percentage of families own either a dog or a cat, but not both.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. I need to find the percentage of families that own either a dog or a cat, but not both. That means I need to exclude the families that own both a dog and a cat from the total number of families that own either a dog or a cat.\n\nFirst, I know that the total percentage of families that own a dog is 60%, and those that own a cat is 30%. But since some families own both, I can't just add those two percentages together because that would count the families that own both twice. So, to find the total percentage of families that own either a dog or a cat, I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe formula for inclusion-exclusion in this case is:\n\nTotal owning either a dog or a cat = Percentage owning dogs + Percentage owning cats - Percentage owning both.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal = 60% + 30% - 20% = 70%.\n\nSo, 70% of families own either a dog or a cat.\n\nBut the question is asking for the percentage that own either a dog or a cat, but not both. That means I need to subtract the percentage that own both from this total.\n\nSo, percentage owning only one of them (either dog or cat, but not both) = Total owning either - Percentage owning both.\n\nThat would be:\n\n70% - 20% = 50%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe directly calculating the percentage of families that own only a dog and only a cat.\n\nThe percentage that owns only a dog would be the total percentage that owns dogs minus the percentage that owns both dogs and cats.\n\nSimilarly, the percentage that owns only a cat would be the total percentage that owns cats minus the percentage that owns both.\n\nSo:\n\nOnly dog = 60% - 20% = 40%.\n\nOnly cat = 30% - 20% = 10%.\n\nThen, the total percentage that owns only one of them would be:\n\n40% + 10% = 50%.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can visualize this with a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents dog owners (60%), and the other represents cat owners (30%). The overlapping area represents families that own both (20%).\n\nSo, the part of the dog circle that doesn't overlap with the cat circle represents families that own only a dog, which is 60% - 20% = 40%.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the cat circle that doesn't overlap with the dog circle represents families that own only a cat, which is 30% - 20% = 10%.\n\nTherefore, the total percentage that owns only one of them is 40% + 10% = 50%.\n\nI think this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use probabilities or set theory to approach this, but since it's a straightforward inclusion-exclusion problem, the method I used seems appropriate.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe if there are families that own neither a dog nor a cat, but the question is specifically about families that own either but not both, so I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that 20% own both, so I've accounted for that in both methods I used.\n\nI feel confident that 50% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50\\%} \\]"
