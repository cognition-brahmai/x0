        "content": "Sure! Here's a Python function that implements the quicksort algorithm on a list of integers:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n\n# Example usage:\n# sorted_list = quicksort([3,6,8,10,1,2,1])\n# print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\nThis function works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This divides the original array into smaller parts until the base case of recursion is reached, which is when the array has one or zero elements. The sorted subarrays are then combined to form the final sorted array."
