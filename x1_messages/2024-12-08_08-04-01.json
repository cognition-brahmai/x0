        "content": "To determine how many additional rooms the hotel chain should add, we need to consider several factors including the current demand, expected growth in tourism, and potential competition. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current situation:\n\n- There are 20 hotels with a combined capacity of 5,000 rooms.\n\n- During peak season, the average occupancy rate is 85%.\n\nSo, during peak season, the number of occupied rooms is:\n\n5,000 rooms * 0.85 = 4,250 rooms\n\nThis means that currently, there is a demand for 4,250 rooms during peak season.\n\nNow, we need to project the demand for the next five years, considering the growth in tourism.\n\nLet's assume that tourism is expected to grow at a certain rate annually. For the sake of this example, let's assume a tourism growth rate of 5% per year. This is just an assumption; you should replace it with the actual projected growth rate.\n\nThe formula to calculate future demand is:\n\nFuture Demand = Current Demand * (1 + growth rate)^number of years\n\nSo, in five years, the demand would be:\n\n4,250 rooms * (1 + 0.05)^5\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.05)^5:\n\n1.05^5 \u2248 1.276\n\nSo, future demand = 4,250 * 1.276 \u2248 5,417 rooms\n\nThis means that in five years, there will be a demand for approximately 5,417 rooms during peak season.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider potential competition from other hotel chains. Let's assume that other hotel chains might also expand, adding a certain number of rooms.\n\nSuppose other hotel chains plan to add, say, 500 rooms in total over the next five years. Again, you should replace this with the actual expected competition.\n\nSo, the total room supply from existing and new competitions would be:\n\nExisting 5,000 rooms + 500 new rooms = 5,500 rooms\n\nNow, comparing the future demand (5,417 rooms) with the total supply (5,500 rooms), it seems that the supply might slightly exceed demand.\n\nBut, we need to ensure that the hotel chain captures a certain market share. Let's assume that the hotel chain aims to capture 30% of the room nights during peak season. Again, adjust this percentage based on actual targets.\n\nFirst, calculate the total room nights demand in five years:\n\n5,417 rooms * (number of peak season days)\n\nAssuming peak season is, say, 120 days a year.\n\nTotal room nights demand = 5,417 rooms * 120 days = 650,040 room nights\n\nNow, if the hotel chain wants 30% market share:\n\nDesired room nights = 650,040 * 0.30 = 195,012 room nights\n\nNow, to find out how many rooms the hotel chain needs to provide these room nights, we need to know their expected occupancy rate.\n\nAssuming they also aim for an 85% occupancy rate during peak season.\n\nSo, room nights provided by the hotel chain = number of rooms * 120 days * 0.85\n\nSet this equal to desired room nights:\n\nnumber of rooms * 120 * 0.85 = 195,012\n\nSolve for number of rooms:\n\nnumber of rooms = 195,012 / (120 * 0.85) = 195,012 / 102 \u2248 1,912 rooms\n\nNow, the hotel chain currently has some number of rooms. Let's find out how many they currently have.\n\nTotal rooms in the city: 5,000\n\nNumber of hotels: 20\n\nAssuming the hotel chain owns, say, 25% of the market share currently.\n\nSo, current rooms owned by the chain: 5,000 * 0.25 = 1,250 rooms\n\nTherefore, the additional rooms needed are:\n\n1,912 desired rooms - 1,250 current rooms = 662 rooms\n\nSo, the hotel chain should add approximately 662 rooms to meet the expected demand and maintain its market share over the next five years.\n\nHowever, this is a simplified calculation. In reality, you would need to consider more factors, such as:\n\n- Seasonal variations in demand\n\n- Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)\n\n- Cost of adding new rooms and return on investment\n\n- Changes in tourism patterns or external factors affecting demand\n\n- Competition's pricing strategies and room offerings\n\n- Regulatory and logistical constraints on expanding hotel capacity\n\nIt's also important to conduct a thorough market analysis and possibly consult with industry experts to get more accurate projections and make informed decisions.\n\nI hope this helps in determining the number of additional rooms the hotel chain should add. If you have more specific data or different assumptions, feel free to adjust the calculations accordingly."
