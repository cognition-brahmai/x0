        "content": "So the bakery sells cupcakes in boxes of 6, and they baked 120 cupcakes today. I need to find out how many boxes they used. Hmm, this seems like a division problem because I'm trying to see how many groups of 6 are there in 120.\n\nSo, I'll divide 120 by 6.\n\n120 \u00f7 6\n\nI know that 6 times 20 is 120, because 6 times 10 is 60, and double that is 120. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That means they used 20 boxes.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any remainder. 120 minus (6 times 20) is 120 - 120 = 0. So, no remainder.\n\nTherefore, the bakery used 20 boxes.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I can use another method. Let's try dividing step by step.\n\n6 goes into 12 two times. Write down 2.\n\nBring down the 0. So now it's 0.\n\n6 goes into 0 zero times. So, the answer is 20.\n\nYeah, that matches what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of multiplication. If each box has 6 cupcakes, and they used x boxes, then 6x = 120.\n\nTo find x, I divide both sides by 6: x = 120 \u00f7 6 = 20.\n\nAgain, 20 boxes.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using addition. If they keep adding boxes of 6 cupcakes until they reach 120.\n\nSo, 6 + 6 + 6 + ... and so on, until reaching 120. Counting how many times I add 6.\n\nBut that would take a while. Let's see, 6 added 20 times is 120.\n\nYeah, that confirms it again.\n\nWait a minute, what if they had some cupcakes left over that didn't make a full box? But in this problem, they baked 120 cupcakes, and they sell them in boxes of 6, so if 6 divides evenly into 120, there should be no leftovers.\n\nLet me check that. 120 divided by 6 is 20, with no remainder.\n\nSo, they used 20 boxes, and there are no leftover cupcakes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the number of cupcakes wasn't divisible by 6.\n\nFor example, if they had 123 cupcakes, 123 \u00f7 6 = 20.5, which isn't possible since you can't have half a box.\n\nSo, in that case, they would have 20 full boxes and 3 cupcakes left over.\n\nBut in this problem, it's exactly 120 cupcakes, which is perfectly divisible by 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 boxes.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to make this more complicated, like considering different box sizes or something, but the problem specifies boxes of 6.\n\nSo, no need to overcomplicate it.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider units.\n\n1 box = 6 cupcakes\n\nSo, number of boxes = total cupcakes / cupcakes per box\n\nNumber of boxes = 120 / 6 = 20\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, using proportions.\n\nIf 6 cupcakes are in 1 box, then 120 cupcakes are in x boxes.\n\nSo, 6/1 = 120/x\n\nThen, solving for x: x = 120 / 6 = 20\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of subtraction.\n\nStart with 120 cupcakes.\n\nTake away one box of 6 cupcakes: 120 - 6 = 114\n\nRepeat until reaching 0.\n\n120 - 6 = 114\n\n114 - 6 = 108\n\n108 - 6 = 102\n\n...\n\nKeep subtracting 6 until reaching 0.\n\nBut that would take 20 steps, which is time-consuming.\n\nBetter to just divide 120 by 6 to get 20.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the answer is 20 boxes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
