        "content": "The sum of the interior angles of a polygon can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum of interior angles = (n - 2) \u00d7 180\u00b0\n\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nFor a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, we can plug in n = 12 into the formula:\n\nSum of interior angles = (12 - 2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 10 \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 1800\u00b0\n\nSo, the sum of the interior angles of a dodecagon is 1800 degrees.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon is derived from the fact that any polygon can be divided into (n - 2) triangles, and since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0, the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is (n - 2) times 180\u00b0.\n\nIn the case of a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, it can be divided into 10 triangles. Therefore, the sum of its interior angles is 10 \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 1800\u00b0.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Regular Dodecagon:** In a regular dodecagon, all sides and angles are equal. Therefore, each interior angle can be found by dividing the sum of the interior angles by the number of angles (which is equal to the number of sides).\n\n  Each interior angle = Sum of interior angles / n = 1800\u00b0 / 12 = 150\u00b0\n\n- **Exterior Angles:** The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always 360\u00b0, regardless of the number of sides. For a regular dodecagon, each exterior angle would be 360\u00b0 / 12 = 30\u00b0.\n\n- **Relationship between Interior and Exterior Angles:** For any polygon, the interior angle and the exterior angle at each vertex are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180\u00b0. So, for a regular dodecagon, 150\u00b0 + 30\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n\n**Application:**\n\nUnderstanding the sum of interior angles is useful in various fields, including geometry, architecture, and engineering, where precise calculations of angles are necessary for design and construction.\n\n**Example Problem:**\n\nIf a regular dodecagon is inscribed in a circle, what is the measure of the central angle corresponding to one side of the dodecagon?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe central angle corresponding to one side of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle is equal to 360\u00b0 divided by the number of sides.\n\nCentral angle = 360\u00b0 / 12 = 30\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the central angle corresponding to one side of a regular dodecagon is 30 degrees.\n\n**Practice Exercise:**\n\nCalculate the sum of the interior angles for a 20-sided polygon (icosagon).\n\n**Answer:**\n\nSum of interior angles = (20 - 2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 18 \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 3240\u00b0\n\n**Challenge Problem:**\n\nIn a regular polygon, each interior angle measures 162\u00b0. How many sides does this polygon have?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nFirst, find the measure of each exterior angle. Since interior and exterior angles are supplementary in a regular polygon:\n\nExterior angle = 180\u00b0 - interior angle = 180\u00b0 - 162\u00b0 = 18\u00b0\n\nThe sum of all exterior angles is always 360\u00b0, so the number of sides (n) can be found by:\n\nn = 360\u00b0 / exterior angle = 360\u00b0 / 18\u00b0 = 20\n\nTherefore, the polygon has 20 sides.\n\n**Real-World Application:**\n\nThe knowledge of polygon angles is crucial in fields like architecture and design. For instance, when designing a 12-sided dome or a dodecagonal building, architects need to calculate the angles precisely to ensure structural integrity and aesthetic appeal.\n\n**Historical Note:**\n\nRegular dodecagons have been used in various historical contexts, including in ancient Greek architecture and in the design of coins. The regular dodecagon is also found in modern architecture and design due to its symmetrical properties.\n\n**Mathematical Properties:**\n\nA regular dodecagon has several interesting properties, including:\n\n- It can be constructed using a compass and straightedge.\n\n- It has 12 lines of symmetry and a rotational symmetry of order 12.\n\n- It can be divided into 12 congruent isosceles triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a dodecagon is 1800 degrees, which is derived from the general formula for polygons. This knowledge is fundamental in geometry and has practical applications in various fields.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1800^\\circ} \\]"
