The expression is:\n\n((3^2 - 4) / 5 + 1)^2 - 3 * 2\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting inside the innermost parentheses:\n\n3^2 means 3 squared, which is 9.\n\nSo, 3^2 - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n(5 / 5 + 1)^2 - 3 * 2\n\nNext, 5 divided by 5 is 1.\n\nSo, 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n(2)^2 - 3 * 2\n\nThen, 2 squared is 4.\n\nSo, 4 - 3 * 2\n\nNow, according to PEMDAS, I need to do the multiplication before the subtraction.\n\n3 * 2 = 6.\n\nSo, 4 - 6 = -2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is -2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-2} \\]"
