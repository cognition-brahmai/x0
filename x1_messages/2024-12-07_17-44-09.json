Let's get started!)\n\n**Title: Unchained Souls**\n\n**Verse 1:**  \nIn a world where everyone's trying to fit in,  \nI stand out, I'm different, and that's just fine.  \nThey say conformity is the way to win,  \nBut I'll march to my own drum, no need to spin.\n\n**Chorus:**  \nWe are the unchained souls, breaking free,  \nDancing to the rhythm of our own decree.  \nNo chains can hold us down, no rules can bind,  \nWe're the rebels, the outliers, the ones who grind.\n\n**Verse 2:**  \nColors bleeding bright, in a black and white world,  \nI wear my heart on my sleeve, tales untold.  \nThey try to mold me, but I won't be hurled,  \nInto a mold that's been set, I'll make my own pearl.\n\n**Chorus:**  \nWe are the unchained souls, soaring high,  \nPainting the skies with our wild, untamed cry.  \nNo map can guide us, no path can lead,  \nWe're the pioneers, the dreamers, the seeds.\n\n**Bridge:**  \nDon't tell me who to be, I'll decide my fate,  \nWith every step I take, I etch my own plate.  \nSociety's norms, they can crumble and break,  \nFor I am the architect of my own makeup.\n\n**Chorus:**  \nWe are the unchained souls, loud and clear,  \nShattering the silence, our voices appear.  \nNo mask can hide us, no lie can disguise,  \nWe're the truth seekers, the free spirits, the rise.\n\n**Outro:**  \nSo here's to the misfits, the odd ones out,  \nTo those who dare to be different, without a doubt.  \nRaise your hands and let your colors fly,  \nFor we are the unchained souls, touching the sky.\n\n**Note:** This is just a starting point. Feel free to modify the lyrics to better fit your vision or the musical style you're aiming for. Rock on!"
