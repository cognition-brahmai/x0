        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'm here to help you with that riddle. Let's see, the riddle goes: \"A house with two occupants, sometimes one, rarely three. Break the walls, eat the boarders, then throw away me.\" Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to decipher what this riddle is referring to. It talks about a \"house\" with occupants, and then instructions to break the walls, eat the boarders, and throw it away. It sounds like something physical, maybe an object or a food item.\n\nLet me start by considering the \"house\" part. A house usually implies some sort of container or structure that holds something inside. Given that it has occupants, perhaps it's something that contains other items or elements.\n\nThe number of occupants changes: sometimes two, sometimes one, rarely three. This suggests that the number of items inside isn't consistent, which could be important.\n\nNext, \"break the walls, eat the boarders, then throw away me.\" This seems like a sequence of actions to be performed on this object. \"Break the walls\" might mean to destroy or remove the outer structure. \"Eat the boarders\" could refer to consuming the edges or boundaries of something. Finally, \"throw away me\" suggests discarding the remaining part after these actions.\n\nLet me think about food items that fit this description. For example, an egg could be a possibility. An egg has a shell (the house), and inside there's the white and yolk (two occupants). Sometimes there might be only one occupant if it's just the yolk, and rarely three if there's an extra yolk. Breaking the walls would be cracking the shell, eating the boarders could mean consuming the egg white, and then throwing away the shell.\n\nThat seems plausible, but let's consider another option. Maybe it's fruit, like an avocado. The avocado has a hard outer shell (the house), and inside is the flesh and a large seed (two occupants). Sometimes there might be only one seed or rarely multiple seeds. Breaking the walls would be cutting open the avocado, eating the boarders could be scooping out and eating the flesh, and then throwing away the pit and skin.\n\nAnother possibility is cheese, like a wheel of cheese. The wheel has an outer rind (the house), and inside is the cheese itself (the occupants). Sometimes there might be just one type of cheese, or different varieties. Breaking the walls would be cutting through the rind, eating the boarders could mean eating the outer layers of cheese, and then throwing away the rind.\n\nWait, but the riddle mentions \"eat the boarders,\" which might specifically refer to consuming the edges or boundaries. In the case of an egg, the boarders would be the egg white surrounding the yolk. In avocado, the boarders would be the flesh around the pit. In cheese, it would be the outer layers.\n\nLet me think of something else. Perhaps it's a sandwich. A sandwich has bread as the house, and fillings inside as the occupants. Sometimes there are two slices of bread with fillings in between, sometimes open-faced with one slice, and rarely three slices for a triple-decker sandwich. Breaking the walls could mean tearing apart the bread, eating the boarders could be eating the bread and fillings, and then throwing away the remains.\n\nHmm, that could work, but it seems a bit forced. Let's consider something else.\n\nHow about a piece of candy, like a jawbreaker or candy coal? The candy has layers (the house), and the occupants could be considered the different flavors or layers inside. Breaking the walls would be cracking open the candy, eating the boarders could be eating the outer layers, and then discarding the core or remaining piece.\n\nThat's another possibility, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's not food at all. Perhaps it's a type of container, like an envelope. An envelope is a house with one or two occupants, like letters or documents. Sometimes there might be multiple items inside. Breaking the walls would be opening or tearing the envelope, eating the boarders could metaphorically mean using or reading the contents, and then throwing away the envelope.\n\nBut that doesn't quite fit because \"eating\" suggests consuming, which doesn't apply to documents.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of packaging, like a candy wrapper. The wrapper is the house, and the candy inside is the occupant. Sometimes there might be more than one candy, but usually just one. Breaking the walls would be opening the wrapper, eating the boarders could be eating the candy, and then throwing away the wrapper.\n\nThat seems similar to the candy example earlier.\n\nLet me consider something else. Maybe it's a type of nut, like a walnut or hazelnut. The nut has a hard shell (the house), and inside is the nut meat (the occupant). Sometimes there might be two halves or just one piece. Breaking the walls would be cracking open the shell, eating the boarders could be eating the nut meat around the center, and then discarding the shell.\n\nThat could be a possibility.\n\nAnother thought: could it be a type of pastry or pie? A pie has a crust (the house), and filling inside (the occupant). Sometimes there might be multiple types of fillings. Breaking the walls would be breaking the crust, eating the boarders could be eating the crust and filling, and then perhaps discarding something else.\n\nNot sure about that.\n\nLet me try to think outside the box. Maybe it's not something edible at all. Perhaps it's a type of structure or building. For example, a house with rooms, and the occupants are people. But breaking the walls and eating the boarders doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of puzzle or game board. For instance, a chess board can be considered a house with pieces as occupants. Sometimes there are two players, sometimes one practicing, rarely three in a game. Breaking the walls could mean dismantling the board, eating the boarders could be removing and perhaps disposing of the edge pieces, and then throwing away the remaining parts.\n\nBut that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nLet me think about materials. Maybe it's a type of material or substance. For example, a block of modeling clay with embedded items inside considered the occupants. Breaking the walls would be breaking the clay block, eating the boarders could be shaping and using the clay, and then discarding the used material.\n\nAgain, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of capsule or pill. The capsule is the house, and the medicine inside is the occupant. Sometimes there might be one type of medicine, sometimes a combination. Breaking the walls would be opening or crushing the capsule, eating the boarders could be consuming the medicine, and then discarding the capsule shell.\n\nThat could be a possibility, but I'm not entirely convinced.\n\nLet me consider something more abstract. Maybe it's a type of account or profile, like a user account on a website. The account is the house, and the users are the occupants. Sometimes there are two users sharing an account, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls could mean accessing or hacking the account, eating the boarders could be using or exploiting the account privileges, and then discarding the account by deleting it.\n\nBut that seems too far-fetched and doesn't align well with the imagery of breaking walls and eating boarders.\n\nI need to think differently. Maybe it's a type of vessel or container used in cooking, like a clay pot or a tin can. The pot is the house, and the food inside is the occupant. Breaking the walls would be smashing the pot, eating the boarders could be consuming the food, and then throwing away the pot shards or can.\n\nThat could work, but it still doesn't fully satisfy the riddle's description.\n\nLet me consider something more specific. Maybe it's an oyster. An oyster has a hard shell (the house), and inside is the oyster meat and sometimes a pearl (the occupants). Sometimes there might be one oyster inside, sometimes two, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be prying open the shell, eating the boarders could be consuming the oyster meat, and then discarding the shell.\n\nInteresting, but I'm not sure if that's the answer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's an ear of corn. The husk is the house, and the kernels are the occupants. Sometimes there are two rows of kernels, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be removing the husk, eating the boarders could be eating the kernels around the cob, and then throwing away the husk.\n\nThat could be a possibility.\n\nAnother thought: could it be a type of fruit, like an orange? The orange has a peel (the house), and segments inside (the occupants). Sometimes there are two main segments, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be peeling the orange, eating the boarders could be eating the segments, and then discarding the peel.\n\nBut oranges usually have more than three segments, so that might not fit.\n\nLet me think about crackers or biscuits. A cracker can be considered a house, with filling or spread as the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be breaking the cracker, eating the boarders could be eating the cracker and filling, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nPossible, but again, it feels a bit off.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of pastry or cookie that has layers, like a sandwich cookie. The cookie is the house, and the filling inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two cookies with filling in between, sometimes one cookie with filling, rarely three layers. Breaking the walls would be splitting the cookie, eating the boarders could be eating the cookie and filling, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nThat could work, but I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider something different. Maybe it's a type of toy or game piece. For example, a pi\u00f1ata is a house with candies inside as occupants. Sometimes there are two types of candies, sometimes one, rarely three types. Breaking the walls would be hitting and breaking open the pi\u00f1ata, eating the boarders could be collecting and eating the spilled candies, and then throwing away the remnants of the pi\u00f1ata.\n\nThat seems quite fitting, actually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of fort or shelter made from edible materials, like a castle made of gingerbread and candy. The walls are the house, and the treats inside are the occupants. Breaking the walls would be demolishing the structure, eating the boarders could be eating the edible materials, and then discarding any non-edible parts.\n\nThat could be a possibility, but perhaps too elaborate.\n\nLet me think about something more common. Maybe it's a type of parcel or box wrapped with packaging. The packaging is the house, and the contents inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two items, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be unwrapping the package, eating the boarders could be using or consuming the contents, and then throwing away the packaging.\n\nBut again, \"eating\" suggests consuming, which doesn't apply to non-edible items.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of food wrapper that is edible, like a corn tortilla used to make tacos. The tortilla is the house, and the fillings inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be tearing or biting into the tortilla, eating the boarders could be eating the tortilla and fillings, and then discarding any leftover parts.\n\nThat could work, but it's similar to other food item examples.\n\nLet me consider something else. Maybe it's a type of vessel used in drinking, like a coconut. The coconut shell is the house, and the coconut water and meat inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two halves, sometimes one, rarely three sections. Breaking the walls would be cracking open the coconut, eating the boarders could be drinking the water and eating the meat, and then discarding the shell.\n\nThat seems quite plausible.\n\nAnother possibility is a type of pod or capsule, like a coffee pod. The pod is the house, and the coffee grounds inside are the occupant. Sometimes there is one type of coffee, sometimes a blend of two, rarely three blends. Breaking the walls would be opening or puncturing the pod, \"eating\" the boarders could be brewing and drinking the coffee, and then discarding the pod.\n\nInteresting, but again, \"eating\" is used metaphorically for drinking.\n\nWait, perhaps \"eat the boarders\" doesn't necessarily mean consuming in the literal sense. Maybe it means removing or disposing of the edges or boundaries.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the answer is different.\n\nLet me consider building materials, like wooden boards or panels. A house can be made from wooden boards, and the occupants are the people inside. Breaking the walls would be demolishing the structure, eating the boarders could be reusing or repurposing the wooden boards, and then throwing away the remaining debris.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to fit well with the riddle's language.\n\nAnother thought: maybe it's a type of puzzle or game board made from tiles or pieces. The board is the house, and the game pieces are the occupants. Sometimes there are two players, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be dismantling the board, eating the boarders could be removing and perhaps disposing of the edge pieces, and then throwing away the board.\n\nBut again, \"eating\" suggests consumption, which doesn't align well with this scenario.\n\nLet me try to think of something else. Maybe it's a type of musical instrument, like a drum. The drum has a shell (the house), and the drumheads and internals are the occupants. Sometimes there are two drumheads, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be dismantling the drum, eating the boarders could be using or playing the drumheads, and then discarding the shell.\n\nThat seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of capsule or cartridge, like an ink cartridge for a printer. The cartridge is the house, and the ink inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two colors, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be opening or dismantling the cartridge, eating the boarders could be using the ink, and then discarding the cartridge.\n\nAgain, \"eating\" is used metaphorically.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps the answer is something more abstract or symbolic.\n\nLet me consider the concept of a home or dwelling. A house with occupants that can vary in number. Breaking the walls could mean destroying the structure, eating the boarders could be consuming the resources or boundaries of the house, and then discarding it by abandoning or demolishing it.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of nest or hive. For example, a bird's nest with eggs as occupants. Sometimes there are two eggs, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be destroying the nest, eating the boarders could be taking or eating the eggs, and then discarding the nest materials.\n\nThat could be a possibility.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's a type of seed pod or fruit with seeds inside. The pod is the house, and the seeds are the occupants. Sometimes there are two seeds, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be opening the pod, eating the boarders could be eating the seeds, and then discarding the pod.\n\nThat seems similar to the nut example earlier.\n\nLet me think about something differently. Maybe it's a type of chamber or compartment, like a compartment in a notebook or a section in a book. The compartment is the house, and the notes or contents inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two types of notes, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be removing the compartment dividers, eating the boarders could be reading or using the notes, and then discarding the notebook.\n\nBut again, \"eating\" doesn't align well with reading notes.\n\nPerhaps I need to think of \"eating\" in a more literal sense, meaning consuming edibles.\n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is something where the boarders or edges are specifically meant to be eaten.\n\nFor example, in some cookies or pastries, the edges are particularly crisp and desirable. So, breaking the walls could be breaking the pastry, eating the boarders could be eating the edges, and then discarding the remaining part.\n\nBut that seems a bit forced.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of pastry that has a crust and a filling, like a pie or a tart. The crust is the house, and the filling is the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be breaking the crust, eating the boarders could be eating the crust and some of the filling, and then discarding the rest.\n\nStill not quite fitting.\n\nLet me consider something more specific. Maybe it's a type of edible container, like a ravioli or dumpling. The dough is the house, and the filling inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be biting into the dough, eating the boarders could be eating the dough and filling, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nAgain, similar to other food item examples.\n\nPerhaps it's a type of omelette. The omelette has the egg as the house, and the fillings inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be cutting or folding the omelette, eating the boarders could be eating the edges of the omelette, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nNot sure about that.\n\nLet me think about something different. Maybe it's a type of burger or sandwich where the bread is the house, and the patties or fillings are the occupants. Sometimes there are two patties, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be tearing open the bread, eating the boarders could be eating the bread and fillings, and then discarding the remaining parts.\n\nSimilar to earlier thoughts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of corn tortilla used to make tacos or quesadillas. The tortilla is the house, and the fillings inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be breaking or folding the tortilla, eating the boarders could be eating the tortilla and fillings, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nAgain, similar to other food items.\n\nMaybe I need to consider something that isn't a food item at all, but rather a type of container or package.\n\nFor example, a type of packet or envelope that contains something inside. The packet is the house, and the contents are the occupants. Sometimes there are two items inside, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be opening or tearing the packet, eating the boarders could be using or consuming the contents, and then discarding the packet.\n\nBut again, \"eating\" suggests consumption, which may not apply to non-edible items.\n\nPerhaps the answer is more straightforward. Maybe it's a type of egg-based food, like an omelette or a quiche.\n\nTake an omelette: the beaten eggs are the house, and the fillings inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be cutting or folding the omelette, eating the boarders could be eating the edges, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nPossible, but I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of pastry or pie where the crust is the house, and the filling inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be breaking the crust, eating the boarders could be eating the crust and filling, and then discarding the remaining parts.\n\nSimilar to earlier thoughts.\n\nLet me consider something different. Maybe it's a type of fort or shelter made from edible materials, like a gingerbread house. The house is made from gingerbread and candy, and the occupants could be treats or decorations inside. Sometimes there are two types of candies, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be demolishing the gingerbread house, eating the boarders could be eating the edible materials, and then discarding any non-edible parts.\n\nThat could be a possibility.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's a type of capsule or sphere made from jelly or another edible substance, containing something inside, like a gummy candy or a liquid center. The jelly is the house, and the contents are the occupants. Sometimes there are two types of contents, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be biting into the jelly, eating the boarders could be consuming the jelly and contents, and then discarding any non-edible parts.\n\nPossible, but I'm still not entirely confident.\n\nLet me think about something more common, like a type of fruit. For example, a peach has a fuzzy skin (the house), and the flesh and pit inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two pits, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be cutting open the peach, eating the boarders could be eating the flesh, and then discarding the skin and pit.\n\nBut peaches usually have only one pit, so that might not fit.\n\nWhat about a pomegranate? A pomegranate has a hard skin (the house), and the arils inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are multiple arils, but the number can vary. Breaking the walls would be breaking open the pomegranate, eating the boarders could be eating the arils, and then discarding the skin.\n\nBut pomegranates don't typically have two or three occupants; they have many arils.\n\nNot sure about that.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of seafood, like a mussel or clam. The shell is the house, and the meat inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two mussels in a shell, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be opening the shell, eating the boarders could be consuming the meat, and then discarding the shell.\n\nThat could be a possibility.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's a type of pill or capsule with contents inside. The capsule is the house, and the medicine or supplements inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two types of supplements, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be opening or crushing the capsule, eating the boarders could be consuming the contents, and then discarding the capsule shell.\n\nPossible, but again, \"eating\" is used metaphorically for consuming medicine.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps the answer is an egg, as I considered earlier.\n\nAn egg has a shell (the house), and inside are the egg white and yolk (the occupants). Sometimes there are two yolks, which would be rare, or just one yolk. Breaking the walls would be cracking open the egg, eating the boarders could be eating the egg white surrounding the yolk, and then discarding the shell.\n\nThat seems to fit well with the riddle's description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of tea egg, which is a hard-boiled egg that's cracked but not peeled, then seasoned and steamed. The cracked shell is the house, and the egg inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two yolks, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be peeling off the shell, eating the boarders could be eating the egg, and then discarding the shell.\n\nThat could work too.\n\nAnother possibility is a type of deviled egg, where the egg is hard-boiled, cut in half, and filled with a mixture. The egg is the house, and the filling inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be cutting the egg open, eating the boarders could be eating the egg and filling, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nPossible, but perhaps not a perfect fit.\n\nLet me consider something else. Maybe it's a type of burger or slider on a bun. The bun is the house, and the patty and toppings inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two patties, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be tearing open the bun, eating the boarders could be eating the bun and patty, and then discarding the remaining parts.\n\nSimilar to earlier thoughts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of dumpling or turnover, like a potsticker or samosa. The wrapper is the house, and the filling inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be biting into the wrapper, eating the boarders could be eating the wrapper and filling, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nAgain, similar to other food items.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's a type of edible container, like a cupcake or muffin with filling inside. The cupcake is the house, and the filling or frosting inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be biting into the cupcake, eating the boarders could be eating the cupcake and filling, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nPossible, but it's getting repetitive.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that \"house\" refers to something more abstract, like a concept or idea.\n\nFor example, maybe it's a type of account or profile, and the occupants are users or data. But that doesn't align well with the physical actions described in the riddle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of package or bundle, like a gift box. The box is the house, and the gifts inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two gifts, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be opening the box, eating the boarders could be using or enjoying the gifts, and then discarding the box.\n\nBut again, \"eating\" doesn't align well with using gifts.\n\nWait, maybe \"eating the boarders\" means disposing of or removing the outer parts, and \"throw away me\" means discarding the remaining core.\n\nIf that's the case, perhaps it's an item where the outer parts are consumed or removed, and the inner part is discarded.\n\nFor example, in some fruits, you eat the outer flesh and discard the core or pit.\n\nTake an apple: the skin and flesh are edible (the boarders), and the core is discarded (me). But the core isn't the house; the fruit is.\n\nHmm, not quite matching.\n\nWhat about a type of seafood, like a lobster or crab? The shell is the house, and the meat inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two main sections of meat, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be cracking open the shell, eating the boarders could be consuming the meat, and then discarding the shell.\n\nThat could work, but it's similar to other shellfish examples.\n\nLet me consider something else. Maybe it's a type of capsule or tablet with a coating. The coating is the house, and the medicine inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of medicine, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be dissolving or breaking the coating, \"eating\" the boarders could be consuming the medicine, and then discarding the coating if it's separable.\n\nBut again, \"eating\" is metaphorical here.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps the answer is an egg, as I considered earlier, because it fits well with the description of having occupants that vary in number and the actions described.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of fruit with a hard shell and edible interior, like a pomegranate or a citrus fruit. For example, an orange has a peel (the house), and segments inside (the occupants). Sometimes there are two main segments, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be peeling the orange, eating the boarders could be eating the segments, and then discarding the peel.\n\nBut oranges typically have multiple segments, not just one or two.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of nut, like a peanut. The shell is the house, and the peanuts inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two peanuts in a shell, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be cracking open the shell, eating the boarders could be eating the peanuts, and then discarding the shell.\n\nThat seems quite fitting.\n\nAnother possibility is a type of pod, like a soybean pod. The pod is the house, and the beans inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two beans, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be opening the pod, eating the boarders could be eating the beans, and then discarding the pod.\n\nPossible, but perhaps not as common as other examples.\n\nLet me consider something more universal. Maybe it's a type of container that is commonly broken open to access its contents, which are then consumed, and the container is discarded.\n\nFor example, a Pringles can, where the can is the house, and the chips inside are the occupants. Sometimes there are two types of chips, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be opening the can, eating the boarders could be eating the chips, and then discarding the can.\n\nBut again, \"eating the boarders\" doesn't align perfectly with eating chips.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of package where the boarders are specifically designed to be eaten, and the rest is discarded.\n\nFor example, some candy bars have wrappers that are not edible, but perhaps there are versions where parts are edible.\n\nBut that seems too speculative.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's a type of food where the boarders or edges are particularly desirable to eat, and the rest is discarded.\n\nFor example, in some bread, the crust is considered a delicacy. So, breaking the walls could be breaking the bread, eating the boarders could be eating the crust, and then discarding the inside.\n\nBut that doesn't fit well with the riddle's description.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's a type of food where the boarders are edible, but the core is not.\n\nFor example, some fruits have edible flesh but inedible seeds or cores. So, breaking the walls would be cutting open the fruit, eating the boarders could be eating the flesh, and then discarding the core.\n\nBut again, it's similar to earlier examples.\n\nLet me consider that the answer might be something where the number of occupants changes, which points towards something biological or natural.\n\nFor example, a type of egg where sometimes there are multiple yolks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of seed pod that can contain varying numbers of seeds.\n\nBut I feel like I'm going in circles here.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that \"house\" refers to something more abstract, like a community or a group.\n\nFor example, a beehive is a house with bees as occupants. Sometimes there are two hives combined, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls could be destroying the hive, eating the boarders could be harvesting honey, and then discarding the hive structure.\n\nBut that seems too specific and doesn't align well with the riddle's language.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of cheese, like a wheel of cheese, where the outer rind is the house, and the inner cheese is the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of cheese inside, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be cutting through the rind, eating the boarders could be eating the cheese, and then discarding the rind.\n\nPossible, but similar to other food items.\n\nLet me consider something different. Maybe it's a type of sushi, like nigiri, where the rice is the house, and the fish on top is the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of fish, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be separating the rice and fish, eating the boarders could be eating the rice and fish, and then discarding any remaining parts.\n\nBut again, it's similar to other food items.\n\nPerhaps it's a type of food where the boarders are specifically meant to be eaten, and the core is not.\n\nFor example, some fruits have edible skin and inedible seeds. So, breaking the walls would be cutting open the fruit, eating the boarders could be eating the skin and flesh, and then discarding the seeds.\n\nBut that seems too broad.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of pastry where the crust is the house, and the filling inside is the occupant. Sometimes there are two types of fillings, sometimes one, rarely three. Breaking the walls would be breaking the crust, eating the boarders could be eating the crust and filling, and then discarding the remaining parts.\n\nSimilar to earlier thoughts.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps the answer is an egg, given how well it fits the description of having varying numbers of occupants and the actions described.\n\nSo, my final answer is an egg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{egg}} \\]"
