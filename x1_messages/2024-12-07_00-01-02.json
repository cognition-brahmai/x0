        "content": "Let's see... I need to pick the event in the 20th century that had a big impact on women's fashion, specifically leading to shorter skirts and simpler cuts. The options are:\n\nA. The invention of the sewing machine\n\nB. The Industrial Revolution\n\nC. World War I\n\nD. The advent of television\n\nFirst off, I know that the sewing machine was invented in the 19th century, around the 1840s by Elias Howe and improved by Isaac Singer in the 1850s. So that's before the 20th century. The Industrial Revolution also mostly happened in the late 18th to early 19th centuries. So options A and B are probably not the right answers because they occurred before the 20th century.\n\nThat leaves me with World War I and the advent of television. Now, World War I took place from 1914 to 1918, which is definitely in the 20th century. And I recall that during WWI, many women started working in factories and taking on roles that were traditionally male, since the men were off fighting in the war. This led to a need for more practical clothing that allowed for movement and functionality.\n\nBefore the war, women's fashion was quite elaborate, with long skirts, corsets, and lots of layers. But during the war, women needed clothing that was easier to move in, so skirts became shorter and cuts became simpler. This was partly for practicality but also because there were rationing measures in place, so using less fabric was necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the advent of television occurred more in the mid-20th century, around the 1950s. While TV did influence fashion, I don't think it directly led to shorter skirts and simpler cuts. In fact, the fashion changes associated with TV might be more related to the influence of media and celebrities on what people wore, but the specific trend of shorter skirts and simpler cuts seems more aligned with the practical needs during WWI.\n\nAdditionally, after WWI, there was a cultural shift towards more liberation and independence for women, which was reflected in fashion. The flapper style of the 1920s, with its shorter hemlines and looser silhouettes, is a direct result of the changes that began during the war.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the correct answer is C. World War I. It had a profound impact on women's roles and, consequently, on their fashion, leading to shorter skirts and simpler cuts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
