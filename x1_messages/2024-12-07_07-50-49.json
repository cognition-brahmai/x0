        "content": "Let's see. There are 120 employees in total, and the ratio of male to female employees is 3:2. I need to find out how many males and females there are.\n\nSo, a ratio of 3:2 means that for every 3 males, there are 2 females. That means the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, if 5 parts represent the total number of employees, which is 120, then one part must be 120 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 120 \u00f7 5 = 24. So, one part is 24.\n\nNow, since there are 3 parts for males, the number of male employees is 3 times 24, which is 72. And for females, it's 2 parts, so 2 times 24, which is 48.\n\nWait, let me check that. 72 males plus 48 females equals 120 employees. Yeah, that adds up. And the ratio is 72:48, which simplifies to 3:2 because both 72 and 48 can be divided by 24. So, 72 \u00f7 24 = 3 and 48 \u00f7 24 = 2. So, the ratio is indeed 3:2.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used fractions. Since the ratio is 3:2, males are 3/5 of the total employees, and females are 2/5.\n\nSo, males: 3/5 \u00d7 120 = 72.\n\nFemales: 2/5 \u00d7 120 = 48.\n\nSame answer as before. Good.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up equations. Let\u2019s say m is the number of males and f is the number of females.\n\nWe know that m + f = 120, and m/f = 3/2.\n\nFrom m/f = 3/2, we can write m = (3/2)f.\n\nNow, substitute m in the first equation: (3/2)f + f = 120.\n\nCombining terms: (3/2)f + (2/2)f = (5/2)f = 120.\n\nNow, solve for f: f = 120 \u00d7 2/5 = 48.\n\nThen, m = 120 - 48 = 72.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think no matter which method I use, I get 72 males and 48 females.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if the ratio is indeed 3:2.\n\n72:48 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 24.\n\n72 \u00f7 24 = 3\n\n48 \u00f7 24 = 2\n\nSo, 3:2. Perfect.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ males and } 48 \\text{ females}} \\]"
