        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a JavaScript function that counts unique words and their frequencies in a string. Then, I need to make a simple web page with a form where users can input text and see the word count and frequency when they submit it.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to handle the string input in JavaScript. I should probably split the string into words, maybe by spaces, and then count how many times each word appears. I'll need to make sure to handle punctuation and case sensitivity, so that \"hello,\" and \"hello\" are counted as the same word.\n\nLet me sketch out the steps for the JavaScript function:\n\n1. Take the input string.\n\n2. Convert it to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.\n\n3. Remove punctuation. I can use a regular expression for that.\n\n4. Split the string into an array of words using space as the delimiter.\n\n5. Use an object to count the frequency of each word.\n\n6. Finally, return the number of unique words and the frequency object.\n\nOkay, now for the web page part. I need a basic HTML form with an input field for text and a submit button. When the form is submitted, I'll need to prevent the default form submission behavior, get the input value, pass it to my JavaScript function, and then display the results on the page.\n\nI should probably use DOM manipulation to update the page with the results. Maybe have a div or a paragraph where I can show the number of unique words and a list of words with their frequencies.\n\nLet me think about the HTML structure:\n\n- A form with a textarea for input.\n\n- A button to submit the form.\n\n- A section to display the results, initially hidden or empty.\n\nThen, in JavaScript:\n\n- Add an event listener to the form's submit event.\n\n- In the event handler, prevent the default action.\n\n- Get the value from the textarea.\n\n- Call the word count function.\n\n- Update the results section with the word count and frequency list.\n\nI should also think about edge cases, like empty input, input with only punctuation, or very large texts. Maybe add some validation or limits.\n\nAlright, let's start coding. First, the JavaScript function.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that counts the unique words and their frequencies in a given string. Additionally, we will implement a basic web page with an input form where users can enter text and see the word count and frequency displayed upon submission.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **JavaScript Function:**\n   - Convert the input string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.\n   - Remove punctuation using a regular expression.\n   - Split the string into an array of words using spaces as delimiters.\n   - Use an object to count the frequency of each word.\n   - Return the number of unique words and the frequency object.\n\n2. **Web Page Implementation:**\n   - Create an HTML form with a textarea for input and a submit button.\n   - Use DOM manipulation to handle form submission and display results.\n   - Prevent the default form submission behavior.\n   - Retrieve the input value, pass it to the word count function, and display the results.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n#### HTML\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Word Frequency Counter</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Word Frequency Counter</h1>\n    <form id=\"wordForm\">\n        <textarea id=\"inputText\" placeholder=\"Enter your text here...\" rows=\"4\" cols=\"50\"></textarea><br>\n        <button type=\"submit\">Count Words</button>\n    </form>\n    <div id=\"results\" style=\"display:none;\">\n        <p>Total unique words: <span id=\"uniqueWordCount\"></span></p>\n        <p>Word Frequencies:</p>\n        <ul id=\"wordFrequencies\"></ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### JavaScript (script.js)\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById('wordForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default form submission\n    const text = document.getElementById('inputText').value;\n    const { uniqueWords, frequencies } = countWords(text);\n    displayResults(uniqueWords, frequencies);\n});\n\nfunction countWords(input) {\n    const cleanedInput = input.toLowerCase().replace(/[^\\w\\s]/g, '');\n    const words = cleanedInput.split(/\\s+/);\n    const frequencyCounter = {};\n    words.forEach(word => {\n        if (word) { // Ignore empty strings\n            frequencyCounter[word] = (frequencyCounter[word] || 0) + 1;\n        }\n    });\n    const uniqueWords = Object.keys(frequencyCounter).length;\n    return { uniqueWords, frequencies: frequencyCounter };\n}\n\nfunction displayResults(uniqueWords, frequencies) {\n    const resultsDiv = document.getElementById('results');\n    const uniqueWordCountSpan = document.getElementById('uniqueWordCount');\n    const wordFrequenciesUl = document.getElementById('wordFrequencies');\n\n    uniqueWordCountSpan.textContent = uniqueWords;\n    wordFrequenciesUl.innerHTML = ''; // Clear previous results\n\n    for (const [word, freq] of Object.entries(frequencies)) {\n        const li = document.createElement('li');\n        li.textContent = `${word}: ${freq}`;\n        wordFrequenciesUl.appendChild(li);\n    }\n\n    resultsDiv.style.display = 'block';\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **JavaScript Function (`countWords`):**\n   - **Step 1:** Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n   - **Step 2:** Remove punctuation using a regular expression (`/[^\\w\\s]/g`).\n   - **Step 3:** Split the cleaned string into words using spaces as delimiters.\n   - **Step 4:** Use an object (`frequencyCounter`) to count the frequency of each word.\n   - **Step 5:** Determine the number of unique words by counting the keys in the frequency object.\n\n2. **Web Page Implementation:**\n   - **HTML Structure:** Includes a form with a textarea for input and a submit button. Results are displayed in a div that is initially hidden.\n   - **Event Handling:** Add an event listener to the form's submit event to handle submission via JavaScript.\n   - **DOM Manipulation:** Update the DOM to display the total unique words and the frequency of each word in a list.\n\nThis approach ensures that the user can input text, get accurate word counts and frequencies, and see the results dynamically on the web page."
