Animals weren't just sources of food and labor; they were integral to the fabric of society, influencing culture, economy, and even mythology. Let's take a journey through time and explore the roles of animals in three ancient civilizations: Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Mesoamerica.\n\nFirst, let's dive into ancient Egypt. The Nile River was the lifeblood of Egyptian civilization, and the animals that thrived along its banks held significant importance. Crocodiles, for instance, were both feared and revered. The god Sobek, often depicted with a crocodile head, was associated with power and fertility. Egyptians even mummified crocodiles as a sign of respect and to ensure a prosperous afterlife for these creatures.\n\nIn terms of economy, domesticated animals like cattle, goats, and sheep were crucial for agriculture and trade. They provided not only meat and milk but also leather and wool, essential resources for clothing and shelter. Additionally, the Nile's fish were a vital source of protein, and fishing was a respected profession.\n\nMoving over to Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, animals played diverse roles. One of the most significant was the role of the horse. Horses were introduced around 2000 BCE and revolutionized warfare and transportation. Chariots, pulled by horses, became symbols of power and status among Mesopotamian rulers.\n\nIn Mesopotamian mythology, animals often represented gods or supernatural forces. For example, the myth of Gilgamesh features a bull sent by the god Anu to punish humanity, which Gilgamesh and his companion Enkidu must slay. This bull likely symbolized natural disasters or the destructive power of nature.\n\nEconomically, animals were indispensable. Oxen were used for plowing fields, while donkeys carried goods along trade routes, facilitating the exchange of commodities like textiles, metals, and grains.\n\nLastly, let's explore the ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica, such as the Maya and Aztec empires. Here, animals held profound cultural and religious significance. The jaguar, with its powerful presence, was synonymous with royalty and warriors. Jaguar skins were worn by elite warriors as symbols of strength and courage.\n\nIn Aztec mythology, the god Tezcatlipoca was often represented as a jaguar, and human sacrifices were sometimes dressed in jaguar skins to honor this deity. Similarly, the quetzal bird, with its vibrant green feathers, was sacred and associated with preciousness and beauty. Its feathers were used in ceremonial headdresses and were more valuable than gold.\n\nAgriculturally, animals like dogs and turkeys were domesticated for food. Dogs, in particular, held a unique place in Mesoamerican culture; they were not only companions but also had spiritual significance, often\u966a\u846c\u5728\u4e3b\u4eba\u7684\u5893\u65c1\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u6765\u4e16\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5f15\u3002\n\nIn conclusion, animals in ancient civilizations were much more than just resources; they were deeply embedded in the cultural, economic, and mythological fabric of society. Whether as symbols of power, sources of sustenance, or participants in religious rituals, animals played indispensable roles that shaped the course of human history.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Dunand, F., & Zivie, J.
