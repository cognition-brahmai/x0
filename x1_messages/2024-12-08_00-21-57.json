The expression is (3^2 - 4) * (5 + 1)^2.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value inside the first parenthesis: 3^2 - 4.\n\n3^2 means 3 multiplied by itself, which is 9.\n\nSo, 9 - 4 equals 5.\n\nNow, the first part is 5.\n\nNext, the second parenthesis: (5 + 1)^2.\n\n5 + 1 is 6.\n\nThen, 6 squared is 6 * 6, which equals 36.\n\nNow, I need to multiply the results of the two parts: 5 * 36.\n\n5 times 36 is 180.\n\nSo, the final answer is 180.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
