        "content": "So I have this problem: a book has 250 pages, and I read 25 pages per day. I need to find out how many days it will take to finish the book. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a total number of pages, which is 250, and I'm reading 25 pages each day. I need to find out how many days it will take to read all 250 pages.\n\nI remember that to find the number of days, I can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages I read per day. So, it should be total pages divided by pages per day.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of days = Total pages / Pages per day\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of days = 250 / 25\n\nNow, 250 divided by 25. Let's see, 25 times 10 is 250, so it should be 10 days.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that there are no remaining pages. Let me check by multiplying 25 pages per day by 10 days.\n\n25 * 10 = 250 pages.\n\nPerfect, that equals the total number of pages in the book. So, it will take exactly 10 days to finish the book.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there were any remainder pages. For example, if the book had 255 pages, and I read 25 pages per day, 255 divided by 25 is 10.2, which would mean 10 full days and a part of the 11th day.\n\nBut in this case, since 250 is perfectly divisible by 25, there are no remaining pages, so exactly 10 days.\n\nAlso, I should consider if I'm reading a constant 25 pages every day, without any breaks. But based on the problem, it seems like I'm reading steadily without any interruptions.\n\nSo, my final answer is 10 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
