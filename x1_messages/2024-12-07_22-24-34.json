        "content": "So there are 25 students in the class, and each student has a different number of pencils, ranging from 1 up to 25 pencils. So, one student has 1 pencil, another has 2, and so on, up to 25 pencils.\n\nTo find the total number of pencils in the class, I need to add up all these individual amounts. So, it's like summing the numbers from 1 to 25.\n\nI remember there's a formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n(n+1)/2. In this case, n is 25.\n\nSo, applying the formula: 25*(25+1)/2 = 25*26/2.\n\nLet me calculate that: 25*26 is 650, and divided by 2 is 325.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pencils in the class is 325.\n\nBut just to make sure, I can also think about it differently. If I pair the students with the least and most pencils, that's 1 and 25, which sum to 26. Then 2 and 24, which also sum to 26, and so on.\n\nLet's see how many such pairs there are. Since there are 25 students, there should be 12 pairs that sum to 26, and one student in the middle with 13 pencils.\n\nWait, because 25 is odd, yes, 12 pairs and one left over.\n\nSo, 12 pairs * 26 = 312, plus the 13 from the middle student, which totals 325.\n\nYep, matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo, the total number of pencils is 325.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{325} \\]"
