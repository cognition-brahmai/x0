        "content": "In the verdant fields of Highbury, where the Thames gently flows,\nLived a maiden fair, with eyes like rose,\nElizabeth, whose smile could light the darkest day,\nBut her heart was torn, in love's entanglement, they say.\n\nIn the ballroom grand, at the Masquerade,\nShe met him, a gentleman, so bold and brave.\nHis eyes, like the sky on a summer's day,\nSpoke of adventures yet to be had, they say.\n\nThey danced beneath the chandeliers so bright,\nLost in each other's gaze, all was right.\nPromises were made, in whispers soft and low,\nBut fate, it seemed, had other plans, they say.\n\nFor he was betrothed, to a lady far away,\nA union arranged, by families in sway.\nElizabeth, with a heart full of woe,\nMust let him go, though it broke her so.\n\nYears passed, and she donned the veil of despair,\nLiving in shadows, where love was rare.\nBut one fateful day, a letter did arrive,\nFrom him, across the seas, where he strove and thrived.\n\n\"My dearest Elizabeth, if you still recall,\nThe nights we danced, beneath the ballroom's thrall.\nI have forsaken all, to be with you, my love,\nFor you, and only you, I do approve.\"\n\nBut alas, it was too late, for she had vowed,\nTo live a life, without love's shroud.\nShe wrote back, with words both kind and firm,\n\"Though my heart still yearns, our paths must part, my charm.\"\n\nSo he sailed back, to the lady far away,\nAnd Elizabeth, in Highbury, stayed to play,\nThe role of a spinster, with a heart unbroken,\nThough inside, she wept, for love had forsaken.\n\nYet, in her garden, where roses bloomed so red,\nShe'd sit and ponder, the love they'd instead.\nAnd though her heart ached, for what could have been,\nShe found solace, in the love of friends, and kin.\n\nSo here lies the tale, of Elizabeth and he,\nA love lost, in the web of destiny.\nA ballad of sighs, and tears shed in vain,\nA reminder that love, is but a fleeting train."
