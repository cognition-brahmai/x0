        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to upgrade its entire fleet of 200 diesel buses to electric ones. Each electric bus costs $500,000, and they have a budget of $60 million. We need to figure out how many electric buses they can purchase with that budget and then calculate the potential savings on fuel costs over 5 years.\n\nFirst, let's see how many electric buses they can buy with $60 million.\n\nTotal budget: $60,000,000\n\nCost per electric bus: $500,000\n\nNumber of electric buses they can purchase: $60,000,000 / $500,000 = 120 buses\n\nSo, with $60 million, they can purchase 120 electric buses.\n\nBut they need to replace 200 buses. So, they can't replace the entire fleet with electric buses within this budget. They can only replace 120 out of 200 buses, which is 60% of the fleet.\n\nNow, let's calculate the fuel savings over 5 years by replacing these 120 buses with electric ones.\n\nFirst, we need to know the annual mileage of a bus. The problem doesn't specify this, so we'll need to make an assumption. Let's assume that each bus drives 400 days a year, with two 10-hour shifts per day, and averages 10 miles per hour.\n\nSo, daily mileage: 10 hours(shift1) + 10 hours(shift2) = 20 hours/day\n\nAt 10 miles per hour: 20 hours/day * 10 miles/hour = 200 miles/day\n\nAnnual mileage: 200 miles/day * 400 days/year = 80,000 miles/year\n\nNow, let's calculate the fuel consumption and costs for diesel buses.\n\nDiesel bus fuel consumption: 5 miles per gallon\n\nFuel cost: $3 per gallon\n\nSo, for each mile, the diesel bus consumes 1/5 = 0.2 gallons\n\nCost per mile for diesel: 0.2 gallons/mile * $3/gallon = $0.60/mile\n\nFor 80,000 miles/year, the annual fuel cost for one diesel bus is:\n\n80,000 miles/year * $0.60/mile = $48,000/year\n\nOver 5 years, the fuel cost for one diesel bus is:\n\n$48,000/year * 5 years = $240,000\n\nNow, let's look at the electric buses.\n\nOperating cost for electric bus: $0.15 per mile\n\nFor 80,000 miles/year, the annual operating cost for one electric bus is:\n\n80,000 miles/year * $0.15/mile = $12,000/year\n\nOver 5 years, the operating cost for one electric bus is:\n\n$12,000/year * 5 years = $60,000\n\nNow, the savings per bus replaced:\n\nSavings per bus = fuel cost of diesel bus - operating cost of electric bus\n\nSavings per bus = $240,000 - $60,000 = $180,000 over 5 years\n\nSince they can replace 120 buses with the $60 million budget, the total savings would be:\n\nTotal savings = 120 buses * $180,000/bus = $21,600,000 over 5 years\n\nSo, by replacing 120 buses with electric ones, the city can save $21,600,000 in fuel costs over 5 years.\n\nHowever, they still have 80 diesel buses remaining (200 - 120 = 80). Let's calculate the fuel cost for these remaining diesel buses over 5 years.\n\nFuel cost per diesel bus over 5 years: $240,000\n\nFor 80 buses: 80 buses * $240,000/bus = $19,200,000 over 5 years\n\nSo, the total fuel cost for the remaining diesel buses is $19,200,000 over 5 years.\n\nBut this is not a saving; it's an ongoing expense.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider the overall fuel cost reduction.\n\nInitially, with 200 diesel buses, the total fuel cost over 5 years would be:\n\n200 buses * $240,000/bus = $48,000,000 over 5 years\n\nAfter replacing 120 buses with electric ones, the fuel cost for the remaining 80 diesel buses is $19,200,000 over 5 years.\n\nSo, the savings would be the difference:\n\nSavings = initial fuel cost - fuel cost after replacement\n\nSavings = $48,000,000 - $19,200,000 = $28,800,000 over 5 years\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the savings as $21,600,000. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, I see the mistake. The $21,600,000 was the savings from replacing 120 buses, calculated per bus as $180,000.\n\nBut actually, the total savings should be $28,800,000, as calculated above.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTotal initial fuel cost for 200 diesel buses: 200 * $240,000 = $48,000,000 over 5 years\n\nTotal operating cost for 120 electric buses: 120 * $60,000 = $7,200,000 over 5 years\n\nTotal fuel cost for remaining 80 diesel buses: 80 * $240,000 = $19,200,000 over 5 years\n\nTotal cost after replacement: $7,200,000 (electric) + $19,200,000 (diesel) = $26,400,000 over 5 years\n\nTherefore, the savings are: $48,000,000 - $26,400,000 = $21,600,000 over 5 years\n\nWait, now I'm getting $21,600,000 again.\n\nEarlier, I thought it was $28,800,000, but that was a miscalculation.\n\nNo, actually, $48,000,000 - $19,200,000 = $28,800,000, but that doesn't account for the operating cost of electric buses, which is $7,200,000.\n\nSo, the actual savings is $48,000,000 - ($19,200,000 + $7,200,000) = $48,000,000 - $26,400,000 = $21,600,000\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the city can purchase 120 electric buses with their $60 million budget and save $21,600,000 in fuel costs over 5 years compared to keeping all 200 diesel buses.\n\nBut perhaps they can consider other factors, like the environmental impact or maintenance costs, which might also differ between electric and diesel buses.\n\nAlso, the assumption of mileage per bus per year might need verification, as it's a key factor in calculating the fuel savings.\n\nAdditionally, the cost of electric buses might decrease in the future, or there might be government incentives for switching to electric vehicles, which could affect the overall cost and savings.\n\nBut based on the given information and the assumptions made, replacing 120 buses with electric ones would save $21,600,000 in fuel costs over 5 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120 \\text{ electric buses can be purchased, saving } \\$21,600,000 \\text{ in fuel costs over 5 years.}} \\]"
