        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a Python script that generates random math problems based on user-specified difficulty levels. We'll cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and provide feedback on the user's answers.\n\nFirst, we need to decide how to structure the difficulty levels. For simplicity, let's define:\n\n- **Easy**: Single-digit numbers\n\n- **Medium**: Two-digit numbers\n\n- **Hard**: Three-digit numbers\n\nWe'll use the `random` module to generate random numbers based on the difficulty level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Get user input for difficulty level.**\n\n2. **Generate two random numbers based on the difficulty level.**\n\n3. **Select a random operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).**\n\n4. **Calculate the correct answer.**\n\n5. **Prompt the user to solve the problem.**\n\n6. **Check if the user's answer is correct and provide feedback.**\n\nLet's start by writing the code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python script that generates random math problems based on user-specified difficulty levels and provides feedback on the user's answers, follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Single-digit numbers\n   - **Medium:** Two-digit numbers\n   - **Hard:** Three-digit numbers\n\n2. **Operations:**\n   - Addition\n   - Subtraction\n   - Multiplication\n   - Division\n\n3. **Steps:**\n   - Get user input for the difficulty level.\n   - Generate two random numbers based on the difficulty level.\n   - Select a random operation.\n   - Calculate the correct answer.\n   - Prompt the user to solve the problem.\n   - Check if the user's answer is correct and provide feedback.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_difficulty():\n    difficulty = input(\"Choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard): \").lower()\n    if difficulty not in [\"easy\", \"medium\", \"hard\"]:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Defaulting to easy.\")\n        difficulty = \"easy\"\n    return difficulty\n\ndef generate_numbers(difficulty):\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        num1 = random.randint(0, 9)\n        num2 = random.randint(0, 9)\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        num1 = random.randint(10, 99)\n        num2 = random.randint(10, 99)\n    else:\n        num1 = random.randint(100, 999)\n        num2 = random.randint(100, 999)\n    return num1, num2\n\ndef select_operation():\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    op = random.choice(operations)\n    return op\n\ndef calculate_correct_answer(num1, num2, op):\n    if op == '+':\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif op == '-':\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif op == '*':\n        return num1 * num2\n    else:\n        # For division, handle potential division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            num2 = random.randint(1, 999)  # Ensure divisor is not zero\n        return num1 / num2\n\ndef main():\n    difficulty = get_difficulty()\n    num1, num2 = generate_numbers(difficulty)\n    op = select_operation()\n    correct_answer = calculate_correct_answer(num1, num2, op)\n    \n    # Format division problems to avoid floating point issues\n    if op == '/':\n        problem = f\"{num1} / {num2} = \"\n    else:\n        problem = f\"{num1} {op} {num2} = \"\n    \n    user_answer = float(input(problem))\n    \n    if abs(user_answer - correct_answer) < 1e-2:  # Allow small floating point errors\n        print(\"Correct!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Incorrect. The correct answer is {correct_answer}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **get_difficulty():**\n   - Prompts the user to choose a difficulty level and validates the input.\n\n2. **generate_numbers(difficulty):**\n   - Generates two random numbers based on the chosen difficulty level.\n\n3. **select_operation():**\n   - Randomly selects one of the four mathematical operations.\n\n4. **calculate_correct_answer(num1, num2, op):**\n   - Computes the correct answer based on the selected operation.\n   - Handles division by ensuring the divisor is not zero.\n\n5. **main():**\n   - Orchestrates the function calls.\n   - Presents the problem to the user and checks the user's answer against the correct answer, providing feedback.\n\nThis script ensures that the user is engaged with problems of varying difficulties and receives immediate feedback on their responses."
