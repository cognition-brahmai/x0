        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, one leaving from Station A at 8:00 AM going towards Station B, and another leaving from Station B at 9:00 AM going towards Station A. The distance between the stations is 300 miles. I need to find out when these two trains meet.\n\nFirst, I should note down the given information:\n\n- Train from A:\n\n- Leaves at: 8:00 AM\n\n- Speed: 60 mph\n\n- Train from B:\n\n- Leaves at: 9:00 AM\n\n- Speed: 90 mph\n\n- Distance between stations: 300 miles\n\nSince the trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly the distance between them is closing. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nBut wait a minute, the train from B leaves an hour later. So, in that one hour, the train from A has already been traveling.\n\nLet me calculate how far the train from A has traveled by 9:00 AM.\n\nFrom 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM is one hour, so:\n\nDistance covered by train A in one hour = 60 mph * 1 hour = 60 miles.\n\nSo, by 9:00 AM, when train B starts, the remaining distance between the two trains is 300 miles - 60 miles = 240 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other starting at 9:00 AM, with a relative speed of 150 mph.\n\nTime taken to cover 240 miles at 150 mph is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 150 mph = 1.6 hours.\n\nNow, 1.6 hours is 1 hour and 0.6*60 minutes = 36 minutes.\n\nSo, the trains will meet at 9:00 AM + 1 hour 36 minutes = 10:36 AM.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, train A travels alone for one hour from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, covering 60 miles. So, the distance left is 240 miles.\n\nThen, both trains travel towards each other at speeds adding up to 150 mph.\n\nTime to cover 240 miles at 150 mph is indeed 1.6 hours, which is 1 hour and 36 minutes.\n\nAdding this to 9:00 AM gives 10:36 AM.\n\nHmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, let's calculate the distances each train has traveled by 10:36 AM.\n\nFrom 8:00 AM to 10:36 AM is 2 hours and 36 minutes, which is 2.6 hours.\n\nSo, train A has traveled 60 mph * 2.6 hours = 156 miles.\n\nTrain B has traveled from 9:00 AM to 10:36 AM, which is 1 hour and 36 minutes, or 1.6 hours.\n\nSo, train B has traveled 90 mph * 1.6 hours = 144 miles.\n\nNow, the total distance covered by both trains is 156 miles + 144 miles = 300 miles, which matches the distance between the stations.\n\nSo, yes, they do meet at 10:36 AM.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10:36 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
