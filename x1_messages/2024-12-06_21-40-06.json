        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 500 employees, and the average salary per employee is $40,000 per year. Additionally, the company spends an extra 25% on benefits for each employee. We need to find out the total annual cost for both salaries and benefits.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total salary cost without benefits. Since there are 500 employees each making $40,000, I can multiply the number of employees by the average salary:\n\nTotal salaries = Number of employees \u00d7 Average salary\nTotal salaries = 500 \u00d7 $40,000\nTotal salaries = $20,000,000\n\nOkay, so the company spends $20,000,000 on salaries alone.\n\nNext, I need to account for the benefits, which are an additional 25% of each employee's salary. So, for each employee, the benefit cost is 25% of $40,000.\n\nBenefit per employee = 25% of $40,000\nBenefit per employee = 0.25 \u00d7 $40,000\nBenefit per employee = $10,000\n\nNow, since there are 500 employees, the total benefit cost would be:\n\nTotal benefits = Number of employees \u00d7 Benefit per employee\nTotal benefits = 500 \u00d7 $10,000\nTotal benefits = $5,000,000\n\nSo, the company spends $5,000,000 on benefits.\n\nTo find the total annual cost for both salaries and benefits, I'll add the total salaries and the total benefits together:\n\nTotal annual cost = Total salaries + Total benefits\nTotal annual cost = $20,000,000 + $5,000,000\nTotal annual cost = $25,000,000\n\nTherefore, the total annual cost to the company for salaries and benefits is $25,000,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe I can calculate the total cost per employee including benefits and then multiply by the number of employees.\n\nLet's try that. If each employee has a salary of $40,000 and benefits of $10,000, then the total cost per employee is:\n\nTotal cost per employee = Salary + Benefits\nTotal cost per employee = $40,000 + $10,000\nTotal cost per employee = $50,000\n\nNow, multiplying by the number of employees:\n\nTotal annual cost = Number of employees \u00d7 Total cost per employee\nTotal annual cost = 500 \u00d7 $50,000\nTotal annual cost = $25,000,000\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, since benefits are 25% of the salary, the total cost per employee is the salary plus 25% of the salary, which is the same as 125% of the salary.\n\nSo, total cost per employee = Salary \u00d7 (1 + 0.25)\nTotal cost per employee = $40,000 \u00d7 1.25\nTotal cost per employee = $50,000\n\nThen, total annual cost = Number of employees \u00d7 Total cost per employee\nTotal annual cost = 500 \u00d7 $50,000\nTotal annual cost = $25,000,000\n\nAgain, the same result. This consistency gives me confidence in the answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe considering the benefits as a percentage of the total salary cost.\n\nTotal benefits = 25% of total salaries\nTotal benefits = 0.25 \u00d7 $20,000,000\nTotal benefits = $5,000,000\n\nThen, total annual cost = Total salaries + Total benefits\nTotal annual cost = $20,000,000 + $5,000,000\nTotal annual cost = $25,000,000\n\nOnce again, $25,000,000.\n\nI think no matter which way I approach this, I end up with the same total annual cost. So, I'm confident that $25,000,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25000000} \\]"
