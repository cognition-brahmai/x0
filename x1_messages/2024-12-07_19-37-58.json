        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of candies: Candy A costs $2 per pound, and Candy B costs $3 per pound. The customer buys a total of 5 pounds of candy, and the combined cost is $11. We need to find out how many pounds of each type of candy they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of pounds of Candy A.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of pounds of Candy B.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total weight of the candies is 5 pounds.\n\n2. The total cost of the candies is $11.\n\nSo, we can write two equations based on these pieces of information.\n\nThe first equation is about the total weight:\n\n\\[ x + y = 5 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total cost. Since Candy A costs $2 per pound and Candy B costs $3 per pound, the total cost can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 2x + 3y = 11 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x + 3y = 11 \\)\n\nI think the best way to solve this is using the substitution or elimination method. Let's try the substitution method first.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ x = 5 - y \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 2(5 - y) + 3y = 11 \\]\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 10 - 2y + 3y = 11 \\]\n\n\\[ 10 + y = 11 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 11 - 10 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 1 pound of Candy B.\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 5 - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 4 pounds of Candy A and 1 pound of Candy B.\n\nLet's check if this makes sense. The total weight is \\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\) pounds, which matches the given total. The total cost is \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) dollars for Candy A and \\( 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\) dollars for Candy B, adding up to \\( 8 + 3 = 11 \\) dollars, which also matches the given total.\n\nSo, the answer should be 4 pounds of Candy A and 1 pound of Candy B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ pounds of Candy A and } 1 \\text{ pound of Candy B}} \\]"
