        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company has 10 employees, and each employee sends 5 emails every day. I need to find out how many emails the company sends in a year, assuming they work 250 days a year. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many emails are sent per day by all the employees together. Since there are 10 employees and each sends 5 emails daily, I can multiply the number of employees by the number of emails per employee per day. So, that's 10 employees times 5 emails, which equals 50 emails per day.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many emails are sent in a year. I'm told that the company works 250 days a year. So, I should multiply the number of emails sent per day by the number of working days in a year. That means 50 emails per day times 250 days.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 50 times 250. Well, 50 times 200 is 10,000, and 50 times 50 is 2,500. Adding those together, 10,000 plus 2,500 equals 12,500.\n\nSo, the company sends 12,500 emails in a year.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way could be to find out how many emails one employee sends in a year and then multiply that by the number of employees.\n\nSo, one employee sends 5 emails per day, and there are 250 working days in a year. So, one employee sends 5 times 250, which is 1,250 emails per year.\n\nNow, with 10 employees, the total would be 1,250 emails per employee times 10 employees, which is also 12,500 emails per year.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe considering the total number of employee-days in a year.\n\nTotal employee-days would be the number of employees times the number of working days, which is 10 times 250, equaling 2,500 employee-days.\n\nSince each employee-day results in 5 emails, total emails would be 2,500 employee-days times 5 emails, which again is 12,500 emails.\n\nAlright, no matter how I look at it, I keep getting 12,500 emails per year.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12500} \\]"
