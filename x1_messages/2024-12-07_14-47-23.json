        "content": "So if I have a bottle that holds 2 liters of water, and I pour out half of its contents, how much water is left? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The bottle initially has 2 liters of water in it. When I pour out half of its contents, that means I'm removing half of the water that's inside.\n\nSo, half of 2 liters would be 2 liters divided by 2, which is 1 liter. So, if I pour out 1 liter, how much is left in the bottle?\n\nWell, if I had 2 liters and I pour out 1 liter, that means there should be 1 liter left.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. Is there any other way to interpret \"half of its contents\"?\n\nWait, the bottle holds 2 liters, but is it full? The question says \"a bottle holds 2 liters of water,\" which might imply that its capacity is 2 liters, but it doesn't specify if it's completely full.\n\nHowever, it also says \"and you pour out half of its contents.\" So, it assumes that there are contents in it, and you're pouring out half of whatever is in there.\n\nIf the bottle holds 2 liters, and it's full, then pouring out half would leave 1 liter.\n\nBut if it's not full, say it has only 1 liter, then half would be 0.5 liters left.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't specify how full the bottle is, only that it holds 2 liters.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that \"holds 2 liters\" means its capacity is 2 liters, but it could be holding less.\n\nHowever, in common usage, saying \"a bottle holds 2 liters of water\" often means that it contains 2 liters, especially if it's about pouring out half.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If the bottle has 2 liters and I pour out half, it's straightforward: 2 liters divided by 2 is 1 liter left.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider units and conversions.\n\n2 liters is equal to 2000 milliliters. Half of that would be 1000 milliliters, which is 1 liter.\n\nSo, regardless of units, the answer remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in fractions, half of 2 liters is (1/2)*2 = 1 liter.\n\nOr, using decimals: half of 2 is 1.\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. The question appears simple: pour out half of the contents of a 2-liter bottle.\n\nTherefore, the amount left should be 1 liter.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider real-world scenarios.\n\nIf I have a 2-liter bottle of water and I drink half of it, there should be half left, which is 1 liter.\n\nOr, if I pour half out into another container, again, 1 liter remains.\n\nIt seems straightforward.\n\nPerhaps the key is understanding that \"half of its contents\" refers to half of the amount of water in the bottle, not half of the bottle's capacity.\n\nWait, but if the bottle holds 2 liters, and it's full, then the contents are 2 liters.\n\nHalf of that is 1 liter poured out, leaving 1 liter.\n\nAlternatively, if the bottle holds 2 liters but only has, say, 1.5 liters, then half would be 0.75 liters poured out, leaving 0.75 liters.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify that; it just says \"a bottle holds 2 liters of water.\"\n\nGiven that, it's reasonable to assume that the bottle is full, meaning it contains 2 liters.\n\nTherefore, pouring out half would leave 1 liter.\n\nI think that's the safest assumption to make in this context.\n\nSo, the answer is 1 liter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ liter}} \\]"
