        "content": "So there are 500 students in total at the school, and 60% of them are girls. I need to find out how many boys there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many girls there are. Since 60% of the students are girls, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 500.\n\nTo find 60% of 500, I can multiply 500 by 0.60.\n\n500 \u00d7 0.60 = 300\n\nSo, there are 300 girls in the school.\n\nNow, to find the number of boys, I can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.\n\n500 - 300 = 200\n\nTherefore, there are 200 boys in the school.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of boys directly.\n\nIf 60% of the students are girls, then the remaining percentage must be boys.\n\n100% - 60% = 40%\n\nSo, 40% of the students are boys.\n\nNow, I can find 40% of 500 to find the number of boys.\n\n500 \u00d7 0.40 = 200\n\nAgain, I get 200 boys.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 200 is the correct number of boys in the school.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way to look at this problem.\n\nSuppose I want to find the ratio of boys to girls.\n\nSince there are 200 boys and 300 girls, the ratio would be 200:300, which simplifies to 2:3.\n\nBut the question only asks for the number of boys, so I don't need to find the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, if I knew the number of boys and girls in different classes or something, that might complicate the problem, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 200 boys in the school.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
