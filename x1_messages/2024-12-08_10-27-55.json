But, it also seems like there were some problems, like political struggles and rebellions.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options is NOT a characteristic of the Ming Dynasty, based on the information provided. So, I need to look at each option and see if it matches what's described.\n\nOption A says \"Cultural and technological advancements.\" From the information, it mentions that it was a period of great cultural and technological advancement. So, that seems to be a characteristic of the Ming Dynasty. So, A is probably not the answer.\n\nOption B says \"Expansion of the Great Wall.\" The text says that the Great Wall was significantly expanded during this time. So, that's also a characteristic. So, B is probably not the answer.\n\nOption C says \"Decline in literary development.\" Hmm, according to the information, the novel as a literary form developed during this period, with famous works being produced. So, it seems like literature was thriving, not declining. In fact, it was a time of literary advancement.\n\nOption D says \"Political instability.\" The text mentions that there were frequent power struggles and rebellions, which indicates political instability. So, that seems to be a characteristic of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, A, B, and D are all mentioned as characteristics of the Ming Dynasty, while C contradicts the information provided. The information says there was development in literature, not a decline.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. \"Decline in literary development\" is NOT a characteristic of the Ming Dynasty, based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
