        "content": "Let's see. The factory originally produces 200 units per hour. They're increasing production by 25%. So first, I need to find out what 25% of 200 is.\n\n25% of 200 is calculated as (25/100) * 200, which is 0.25 * 200 = 50 units.\n\nSo, the production increase is 50 units per hour. Therefore, the new production rate is the original 200 units plus the 50 units increase, which is 250 units per hour.\n\nNow, they work an 8-hour workday. So, to find out how many widgets they produce in one day, I need to multiply the hourly production rate by the number of hours in the workday.\n\nThat is 250 units/hour * 8 hours = 2000 units.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, if production is increased by 25%, the new production rate is 100% + 25% = 125% of the original rate.\n\nSo, 125% of 200 units is (125/100) * 200 = 1.25 * 200 = 250 units per hour.\n\nThen, 250 units per hour * 8 hours = 2000 units per day.\n\nYeah, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the total production before the increase, it would be 200 units/hour * 8 hours = 1600 units per day.\n\nThen, a 25% increase on 1600 units would be (25/100) * 1600 = 0.25 * 1600 = 400 units.\n\nSo, the total production after the increase would be 1600 + 400 = 2000 units per day.\n\nWait, that's the same answer again. So, it seems consistent.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I'm interpreting the percentage increase correctly. Is it 25% per hour, or is it a total increase for the day? The question says \"increase production by 25%,\" and it's about the rate per hour, so I think the 25% applies to the hourly rate.\n\nSo, increasing the hourly rate by 25% leads to 250 units per hour, and then multiplying by 8 hours gives 2000 units per day.\n\nAlternatively, if the 25% increase was applied to the total daily production, then it would be different.\n\nWait, let's explore that possibility too, just to be sure.\n\nIf the original daily production is 200 units/hour * 8 hours = 1600 units.\n\nThen, a 25% increase on the daily production would be 1600 + (0.25 * 1600) = 1600 + 400 = 2000 units.\n\nWhich is the same as when I increased the hourly rate by 25% and then multiplied by 8 hours.\n\nSo, either way, it seems to lead to 2000 units per day after the increase.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 2000 widgets in one 8-hour workday after the increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2000} \\]"
