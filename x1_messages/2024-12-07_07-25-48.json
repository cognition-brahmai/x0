        "content": "So I've got this problem: if you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what's the probability that the sum of the rolls is 7? Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die twice. Since each roll is independent, and there are 6 faces on a die, the first roll has 6 possible outcomes, and the second roll also has 6 possible outcomes. So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling the die twice is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nOkay, so there are 36 possible pairs of rolls. Now, I need to find out how many of these pairs add up to 7. Let me list out the possible combinations where the sum is 7.\n\nIf the first roll is 1, then the second roll must be 6 to make the sum 7 (1 + 6 = 7).\n\nIf the first roll is 2, then the second roll must be 5 (2 + 5 = 7).\n\nIf the first roll is 3, then the second roll must be 4 (3 + 4 = 7).\n\nIf the first roll is 4, then the second roll must be 3 (4 + 3 = 7).\n\nIf the first roll is 5, then the second roll must be 2 (5 + 2 = 7).\n\nIf the first roll is 6, then the second roll must be 1 (6 + 1 = 7).\n\nSo, there are 6 possible combinations that result in a sum of 7.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 6, and the total number of possible outcomes is 36.\n\nSo, the probability is 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm my answer? Maybe using the concept of equally likely sums or something like that.\n\nI know that when rolling two dice, the possible sums range from 2 to 12. Maybe I can list out all the possible sums and see how many ways each sum can occur.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Sum of 2: Only one way, 1 + 1.\n\n- Sum of 3: Two ways, 1 + 2 and 2 + 1.\n\n- Sum of 4: Three ways, 1 + 3, 2 + 2, 3 + 1.\n\n- Sum of 5: Four ways, 1 + 4, 2 + 3, 3 + 2, 4 + 1.\n\n- Sum of 6: Five ways, 1 + 5, 2 + 4, 3 + 3, 4 + 2, 5 + 1.\n\n- Sum of 7: Six ways, 1 + 6, 2 + 5, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 5 + 2, 6 + 1.\n\n- Sum of 8: Five ways, 2 + 6, 3 + 5, 4 + 4, 5 + 3, 6 + 2.\n\n- Sum of 9: Four ways, 3 + 6, 4 + 5, 5 + 4, 6 + 3.\n\n- Sum of 10: Three ways, 4 + 6, 5 + 5, 6 + 4.\n\n- Sum of 11: Two ways, 5 + 6, 6 + 5.\n\n- Sum of 12: One way, 6 + 6.\n\nSo, indeed, the sum of 7 has the most possible combinations, with 6 ways.\n\nGiven that there are 36 possible outcomes in total, and 6 of them result in a sum of 7, the probability is still 6/36, which is 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of probability theory. The probability of the first roll being any number is 1/6, and for each first roll, there's exactly one second roll that will make the sum 7. So, the probability for each pair is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. Since there are 6 such pairs, the total probability is 6 * (1/36) = 1/6.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that no matter what the first roll is, there's always exactly one second roll that will make the sum 7. So, the probability is 1/6.\n\nWait, but is that always true? Let's test it. If the first roll is 1, then second roll needs to be 6. If first roll is 2, second needs to be 5, and so on, up to first roll is 6, second needs to be 1. So, yes, for each first roll, there's exactly one second roll that makes the sum 7.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 1/6.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if the dice are fair and independent. The problem states that it's a fair six-sided die, and I'm assuming the rolls are independent, which is standard for dice rolls. So, no issues there.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe if the dice are indistinguishable, but typically in probability problems, dice are considered distinguishable, meaning that a 1 followed by a 6 is different from a 6 followed by a 1.\n\nBut in this case, since we're looking at sums, the order doesn't matter because addition is commutative. So, whether it's 1 then 6 or 6 then 1, the sum is still 7. But in the earlier approach, I considered ordered pairs, which is correct because each ordered pair is equally likely.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this using unordered pairs, but that complicates things because some sums can be achieved in more ways than others.\n\nFor example, a sum of 7 can be achieved in 6 ways with ordered pairs, but in unordered pairs, some sums have fewer unique combinations.\n\nBut sticking with ordered pairs seems clearer and more straightforward, especially since it aligns with the basic principles of probability for independent events.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that the sum of two rolls of a fair six-sided die is 7 is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
