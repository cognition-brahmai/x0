Since there are 12 months in a year, 10 years would have:\n\n10 years \u00d7 12 months/year = 120 months\n\nNow, if the person saves $200 each month, the total savings after 120 months would be:\n\n$200/month \u00d7 120 months = $24,000\n\nSo, at the end of 10 years, the person would have saved $24,000, assuming no interest is earned on the savings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24000} \\]"
