        "content": "Let's see. So, if a car uses 4 gallons of gas to travel 120 miles, how many gallons will it need to travel 450 miles? Hmm, this seems like a problem about proportions. I remember that in proportions, if one quantity changes, another quantity changes in relation to it.\n\nSo, first, I need to find out how much gas the car uses per mile. If it uses 4 gallons for 120 miles, then the rate is 4 gallons divided by 120 miles. Let me calculate that:\n\n4 gallons \u00f7 120 miles = 0.0333... gallons per mile.\n\nWait, that seems really small. Maybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps it's better to find out how many miles the car can travel per gallon. That might make more sense.\n\nSo, if 4 gallons allow for 120 miles, then per gallon, it would be:\n\n120 miles \u00f7 4 gallons = 30 miles per gallon.\n\nOkay, that sounds more manageable. So, the car gets 30 miles per gallon.\n\nNow, if I need to find out how many gallons it needs to travel 450 miles, I can set up the equation:\n\nGallons needed = total miles to travel \u00f7 miles per gallon.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nGallons needed = 450 miles \u00f7 30 miles per gallon.\n\nLet me do that division:\n\n450 \u00f7 30 = 15.\n\nSo, the car will need 15 gallons to travel 450 miles.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way could be to set up a proportion. If 120 miles corresponds to 4 gallons, then 450 miles corresponds to x gallons.\n\nSo, 120 miles : 4 gallons = 450 miles : x gallons.\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n120 / 4 = 450 / x.\n\nWait, actually, that should be:\n\n120 / 450 = 4 / x.\n\nNo, actually, when setting up proportions, we need to keep the same units in the numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf 120 miles require 4 gallons, then 1 mile requires 4/120 gallons.\n\nSimilarly, 450 miles would require (4/120) * 450 gallons.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 4 divided by 120 is 0.0333... gallons per mile.\n\nThen, 0.0333... gallons per mile times 450 miles equals:\n\n0.0333... * 450 = 15 gallons.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, since the car travels 30 miles per gallon, for 450 miles, it would need 450 divided by 30, which is again 15 gallons.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, the answer seems to be 15 gallons.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like maybe the efficiency of the car changes with distance, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the car will need 15 gallons of gas to travel 450 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
