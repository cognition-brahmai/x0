        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 20 apples and 15 oranges. I need to find the probability that if I pick two fruits one after the other, both of them are apples. And I have to eat the first one before picking the second, so I won't be putting it back. That means it's without replacement, right?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the total number of fruits in the box. There are 20 apples and 15 oranges, so total fruits are 20 + 15 = 35 fruits.\n\nNow, probability of picking two apples in a row without replacing the first one. I think I need to use the concept of conditional probability here.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Event A: First fruit is an apple.\n\n- Event B: Second fruit is an apple, given that the first one was an apple.\n\nI need to find the probability of both A and B happening, which is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nFirst, find P(A), the probability that the first fruit is an apple.\n\nThere are 20 apples out of 35 fruits, so P(A) = 20/35.\n\nNow, P(B|A), the probability that the second fruit is an apple given that the first one was an apple.\n\nIf the first fruit was an apple, then there are now 19 apples left and the total fruits are now 34, since I ate the first one.\n\nSo, P(B|A) = 19/34.\n\nTherefore, P(A and B) = (20/35) * (19/34).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 20/35 can be simplified. Both 20 and 35 are divisible by 5, so 20/35 = 4/7.\n\nSimilarly, 19/34 can't be simplified further since 19 is a prime number and doesn't divide 34.\n\nSo, P(A and B) = (4/7) * (19/34).\n\nNow, multiplying these fractions: numerator is 4*19 = 76, denominator is 7*34 = 238.\n\nSo, P(A and B) = 76/238.\n\nCan this be simplified? Let's see, both 76 and 238 are divisible by 2.\n\n76 \u00f7 2 = 38, 238 \u00f7 2 = 119.\n\nSo, 38/119.\n\nCan this be simplified further? Let's check if 38 and 119 have any common factors.\n\n38 is 2*19, and 119 is 7*17. No common factors, so 38/119 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if 38 and 119 have any other factors in common.\n\n38: 1, 2, 19, 38.\n\n119: 1, 7, 17, 119.\n\nNo common factors other than 1, so 38/119 is indeed the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both fruits picked are apples is 38/119.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to understand it better.\n\n38 divided by 119 is approximately 0.3193, which is about 31.93%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 31.93% chance that both fruits picked are apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with P(A) = 20/35 = 4/7.\n\nThen P(B|A) = 19/34.\n\nMultiplying them: (4/7)*(19/34) = 76/238.\n\nSimplifying 76/238 by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 38/119.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 apples out of 20 is C(20,2), and the total number of ways to pick any 2 fruits out of 35 is C(35,2).\n\nSo, P both apples = C(20,2) / C(35,2).\n\nLet me calculate that to verify.\n\nC(20,2) = (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\nC(35,2) = (35*34)/2 = 595.\n\nSo, P = 190 / 595 = 38/119.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlright, that gives me confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the problem as the probability of picking an apple first and then another apple second.\n\nWhich is what I did initially.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer, which is consistent.\n\nI think that's the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{38}{119}} \\]"
