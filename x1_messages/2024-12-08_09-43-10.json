        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 25 meters long and 15 meters wide. I need to figure out how many wooden posts are needed if they're placed every 2 meters apart around the entire garden.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the perimeter of the garden because the fence is going around the entire thing. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP = 2*(25m + 15m) = 2*(40m) = 80 meters.\n\nSo, the total perimeter is 80 meters.\n\nNow, if posts are placed every 2 meters, I can find the number of posts by dividing the perimeter by the distance between posts. So, 80m / 2m = 40 posts.\n\nBut wait a minute, I need to think about whether that makes sense. If I divide the perimeter by the interval between posts, I get 40, but in reality, the first post and the last post would be at the same place, closing the loop around the garden.\n\nSo, in a closed loop like this, the number of posts should be equal to the number of intervals between them. So, if the perimeter is 80 meters and posts are every 2 meters, there should be 80 / 2 = 40 posts.\n\nHowever, sometimes in these kinds of problems, it's tricky because you might be tempted to add an extra post, but in a closed loop, the first and last post coincide, so you don't need an extra post.\n\nLet me double-check with a smaller example. Suppose the garden is just 4 meters by 2 meters, so perimeter is 2*(4+2) = 12 meters. If posts are every 2 meters, 12 / 2 = 6 posts. Let's visualize that:\n\nStart at one corner, place a post, then every 2 meters: post at 0m, 2m, 4m, 6m, 8m, 10m, and then back to 0m. Wait, that seems like 6 posts, but 10m to 0m closes the loop, so still 6 posts in total.\n\nSo, in this case, for the actual problem, 80 / 2 = 40 posts should be correct.\n\nBut let me consider if the posts at the corners might affect this. In a rectangle, the corners might require a post, but since I'm placing posts every 2 meters, the corners should naturally have posts as long as the distances align.\n\nLet me check the distances to the corners. For the length of 25 meters, if posts are every 2 meters, 25 is not divisible by 2, so 25m would not align with a post unless I place one at 24m and then perhaps an additional one at 25m, but that complicates things.\n\nWait, actually, 25 meters divided by 2 meters per post interval doesn't come out even. 25 / 2 = 12.5, so there would be 12 intervals of 2 meters each, covering 24 meters, and then an extra 1 meter.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Similarly, the width is 15 meters, which is also not divisible by 2 meters. 15 / 2 = 7.5, so 7 intervals of 2 meters each, covering 14 meters, with 1 meter left over.\n\nThis suggests that my initial approach might be missing something because the sides aren't divisible by the post interval.\n\nMaybe I need to adjust the approach. Perhaps I should calculate the number of posts per side and then sum them up, making sure to account for the corner posts correctly.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, for the length sides (25 meters each):\n\nNumber of intervals per length side: 25 / 2 = 12.5, which means 12 intervals and thus 13 posts per length side (since you need a post at each end).\n\nBut wait, 12 intervals of 2 meters would cover 24 meters, leaving 1 meter. So, to cover the entire 25 meters, I'd need an extra post at 25 meters, making it 13 posts per length side.\n\nSimilarly, for the width sides (15 meters each):\n\n15 / 2 = 7.5, so 7 intervals and 8 posts per width side.\n\nBut now, if I just add up the posts for all four sides: 2*(13) + 2*(8) = 26 + 16 = 42 posts.\n\nHowever, this counts the corner posts twice, once for each adjacent side. Since there are four corners, I've double-counted four posts.\n\nTherefore, to get the correct total, I need to subtract the four double-counted corner posts:\n\nTotal posts = 42 - 4 = 38 posts.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of intervals around the perimeter and then add one post for the starting point.\n\nSince the perimeter is 80 meters and posts are every 2 meters, the number of intervals is 80 / 2 = 40.\n\nIn a closed loop, the number of posts should equal the number of intervals, so 40 posts.\n\nBut earlier, when I accounted for the corner posts, I got 38 posts. Which one is correct?\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, and I need to resolve it.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nLet me consider that in the first approach, where I divided the perimeter by the interval and got 40 posts, I didn't account for the fact that the sides aren't divisible by the interval, leading to extra posts needed at the ends.\n\nBut in the second approach, I explicitly calculated posts per side and adjusted for double-counted corner posts, arriving at 38.\n\nPerhaps 38 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the starting post could be at a corner, and then see how the posts align along the sides.\n\nLet me try visualizing starting at one corner:\n\n- Along the first length side (25m): posts at 0m, 2m, 4m, ..., 24m, 25m (13 posts).\n\n- Along the first width side (15m): posts at 0m, 2m, 4m, ..., 14m, 15m (8 posts), but the post at 0m is the same as the last post of the previous side.\n\n- Along the second length side (25m): posts at 0m, 2m, 4m, ..., 24m, 25m (13 posts), but the post at 0m is the same as the last post of the previous side.\n\n- Along the second width side (15m): posts at 0m, 2m, 4m, ..., 14m, 15m (8 posts), but the post at 0m is the same as the last post of the previous side.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nFirst length: 13 posts, but the last post is shared with the first width.\n\nFirst width: 8 posts, but the last post is shared with the second length.\n\nSecond length: 13 posts, but the last post is shared with the second width.\n\nSecond width: 8 posts, but the last post is shared with the first length.\n\nSo, total posts = 13 + 8 + 13 + 8 - 4 (for the four shared corner posts) = 42 - 4 = 38 posts.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering the perimeter approach, with 80 meters and posts every 2 meters, it should be 40 posts, but perhaps there's an adjustment needed for the sides not being divisible by the interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the discrepancy is due to the fact that the sides aren't divisible by the interval, leading to overlapping posts or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the posts don't align perfectly at the corners, but that seems problematic.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to adjust the positions to make sure that the corners have posts.\n\nIf I place posts every 2 meters, but the side lengths aren't divisible by 2 meters, then the posts won't land exactly at the corners.\n\nThis could be a problem because you'd want posts at the corners for structural integrity.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust the post positions so that there are posts at each corner, and then space the remaining posts every 2 meters along the sides.\n\nIn that case, I would need to ensure there's a post at each of the four corners.\n\nThen, for each side, the number of additional posts would be determined by the length minus the corner posts.\n\nFor the length sides (25 meters):\n\nDistance between corner posts: 25 meters.\n\nNumber of additional posts: floor(25 / 2) = 12 posts.\n\nBut 12*2 = 24 meters, which leaves 1 meter without a post.\n\nWait, but if I place 12 posts between the two corner posts, that makes 13 posts in total for the side, including the corner posts.\n\nBut 12 intervals of 2 meters cover 24 meters, leaving 1 meter.\n\nSo, do I need an extra post at 25 meters, making it 14 posts per length side?\n\nBut that would be inconsistent with the interval.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to adjust the interval slightly to account for the fact that the side lengths aren't divisible by the interval.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the posts don't necessarily have to be every exactly 2 meters apart if the side lengths aren't divisible by 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the posts are placed every 2 meters strictly, and the last post may not land exactly at the corner.\n\nIn that case, I'd need to calculate based on the perimeter being 80 meters, divided into 40 intervals of 2 meters each, with 40 posts in total.\n\nBut earlier, when I accounted for the sides not being divisible by 2 meters, I got 38 posts.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to consider the perimeter as a continuous loop and divide by the interval, getting 40 posts, without worrying about the sides not being divisible by the interval.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is indeed 40 posts, and the slight misalignment at the corners is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 40 posts, and the corners will have posts that are not exactly at the corner points due to the side lengths not being divisible by the interval.\n\nThis seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of posts per side based on the length divided by the interval, rounding up to ensure coverage.\n\nFor the length sides (25 meters):\n\nNumber of intervals: 25 / 2 = 12.5, round up to 13 intervals.\n\nNumber of posts: 13 + 1 = 14 posts per length side.\n\nWait, but 13 intervals of 2 meters cover 26 meters, which is more than the side length.\n\nThis doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of posts per side as ceiling(length / interval), but I need to be careful with the corner posts.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for what should be a straightforward problem.\n\nPerhaps I should stick with the initial approach of perimeter divided by interval, which gives 40 posts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 40 posts, and the slight misalignment at the corners is acceptable.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with 40 posts as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
