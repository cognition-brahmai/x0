        "content": "Let's see... You say you're taken from a mine and shut up in a wooden case, never released, yet used by almost every person. Hmm, mines produce various things like minerals, metals, and even coal. So maybe it's something extracted from the earth that's then enclosed in wood.\n\nCould it be coal? Coal is mined, and sometimes it's stored in wooden boxes or cases. But I'm not sure if it's used by almost every person directly. Maybe not, since many people use electricity or other forms of energy now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's graphite. Graphite is mined and is used in pencils, which are wooden cases that contain the graphite lead. Pencils are used by almost everyone for writing and drawing. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but pencils have a wooden case, and the graphite is enclosed within it, never released. People use pencils frequently, so that fits the clue.\n\nAnother possibility is that it's some kind of wood product, but if it's taken from a mine, that suggests it's not purely wooden.\n\nLet me consider minerals. Maybe it's graphite, as I thought, or perhaps another mineral that's used widely by people.\n\nIs it charcoal? Charcoal is made from wood, but it's not mined; it's produced through a process of heating wood without oxygen. So that might not fit.\n\nWhat about pencils specifically? Pencils contain graphite, which is mined, and the graphite is enclosed in a wooden case. People use pencils all the time for writing, drawing, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of wood preserved with minerals, but that seems less likely.\n\nLet me think differently. If it's shut up in a wooden case and never released, maybe it's a substance used in construction or furniture, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: is it a musical instrument? Some musical instruments are made from wood and might contain minerals or other materials mined from the earth.\n\nBut musical instruments aren't typically shut up in a wooden case; they are the wooden case. That doesn't seem to fit.\n\nPerhaps it's something used in art besides pencils. Like\u989c\u6599, but\u989c\u6599 usually comes in tubes or jars, not wooden cases.\n\nWait, maybe it's a cricket bat or a baseball bat. They are made from wood, but they aren't enclosed in a wooden case.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me go back to the pencil idea. Graphite is mined, processed, and then enclosed in a wooden casing to make a pencil. Pencils are indeed used by almost every person at some point, if not regularly.\n\nAnother possibility: Chopsticks. Some chopsticks are made from wood, but they aren't enclosed in a wooden case, and chopsticks aren't mined from the earth.\n\nWait, perhaps it's something more abstract. Like, a idea or concept that's contained within a book, which is a wooden case\u2014wait, books are usually paper or digital now, not wooden.\n\nUnless it's a book that's bound in wood, but that's uncommon.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider the phrase \"shut up in a wooden case.\" What could that mean? Maybe it's something that's enclosed or contained within wood, never to be released.\n\nCould it be a ship in a bottle, but that's not mined and not used by almost every person.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of wood that's treated with something mined, but that seems like a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, is it a wooden toy that contains something mined inside it?\n\nThat seems too vague.\n\nLet me try to think of other items that are wooden and contain something mined.\n\nMaybe a wooden box that contains something valuable, but that doesn't fit because the valuable item is released when needed.\n\nWait, but the clue says it's never released, so whatever it is, it stays enclosed within the wooden case.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's something like a wooden pen with ink enclosed inside it. But ink isn't mined; it's manufactured.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's a wooden pencil with the graphite lead inside it. That fits: graphite is mined, enclosed in wood, and used by almost everyone.\n\nThat seems like the most likely answer.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nGraphite is indeed mined, especially in places like Sri Lanka, China, and some parts of Africa. It's then processed and used in pencils, which are wooden cases that contain the graphite lead.\n\nPencils are widely used by people for writing, drawing, and other purposes.\n\nSo, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, could it be a wooden writing implement like a stylus? But styluses aren't typically made from mined materials, unless it has a tip made from something mined.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a wooden matches, where the head contains phosphorus or sulfur, which are mined minerals.\n\nWooden matches do have a head that contains ignitable substances, some of which are mined.\n\nBut matches are used by many people, and they are indeed wooden cases that contain the ignitable substance.\n\nHowever, matches are designed to be used and consumed, whereas the riddle says it's never released.\n\nBut the substance remains enclosed until the match is struck and burns.\n\nSo, in a way, it's released through combustion.\n\nNot sure if that fits perfectly.\n\nComparatively, the pencil seems like a better fit.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is a pencil.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{pencil}} \\]"
