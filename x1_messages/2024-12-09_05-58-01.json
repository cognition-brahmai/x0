        "content": "Let's see. The factory originally produces 1200 units of product A per day. Then, the production rate is increased by 25%. So, first I need to calculate the new production rate.\n\nTo find the increase, I'll take 25% of 1200:\n\n25% of 1200 = 0.25 \u00d7 1200 = 300 units.\n\nSo, the new production rate is:\n\n1200 units + 300 units = 1500 units per day.\n\nNow, the problem says that even with this increase, it still takes the same amount of time to sell all produced units. That means the selling rate hasn't changed; it's still selling the units at the same rate as before.\n\nWait, but I need to find out how many days it will take to produce and sell 15,000 units.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current situation:\n\n- Original production: 1200 units/day.\n\n- Increased production by 25%: new production = 1500 units/day.\n\n- Selling time remains the same.\n\nHmm, what does \"it still takes the same amount of time to sell all produced units\" mean?\n\nI think it means that despite the increase in production, the time from production to selling all units remains the same. Maybe the selling rate has also increased proportionally.\n\nWait, but it doesn't specify anything about the selling rate. Maybe I need to assume that the selling rate adjusts to match the production rate.\n\nIn other words, all units produced are sold in the same amount of time as before.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of production and selling simultaneously.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. Original production: 1200 units/day.\n\n2. Production increased by 25%: new production = 1500 units/day.\n\n3. Time to sell all produced units remains the same.\n\n4. Need to find how many days to produce and sell 15,000 units.\n\nPerhaps the time to sell all produced units remains the same per batch.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nOriginally, producing 1200 units and selling them takes a certain amount of time, say T days.\n\nAfter increase, producing 1500 units and selling them takes the same T days.\n\nWait, but production is now faster, so in one day, they produce more, but selling also needs to handle more units in the same time.\n\nBut maybe T is the time to sell a batch, and the batch size has increased.\n\nWait, perhaps T is the time to sell whatever is produced in one day.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose originally, they produce 1200 units per day and sell them over S days.\n\nAfter increase, they produce 1500 units per day and sell them over S days.\n\nSo, in both cases, selling takes S days.\n\nBut I need to find out how many days it takes to produce and sell 15,000 units.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the total time to produce and sell 15,000 units at the new production rate, given that selling keeps up with the increased production.\n\nGiven that the selling time per batch remains the same, but production has increased.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the total units produced and sold over a certain period.\n\nLet me consider that in T days, they produce 1500T units and sell 1500T units.\n\nBut selling is keeping up with production.\n\nSo, at any point, the inventory is being sold at the same rate as it's being produced.\n\nTherefore, there is no buildup of inventory; it's a steady state.\n\nSo, the number of days to produce and sell 15,000 units would simply be the total units divided by the daily production rate.\n\nTherefore, days = total units / daily production rate.\n\nSo, days = 15,000 / 1500 = 10 days.\n\nWait, but is it that straightforward?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf they produce 1500 units per day and sell 1500 units per day, then yes, the inventory remains constant, and to produce and sell 15,000 units, it would take 15,000 / 1500 = 10 days.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the production rate is increased by 25%, but it still takes the same amount of time to sell all produced units.\n\nDoes that imply that the selling rate has also increased by 25% to match the production increase?\n\nIf that's the case, then yes, the inventory remains constant, and the calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, if the selling rate remains the same, then with increased production, the inventory would build up, and it would take longer to sell the excess inventory.\n\nBut according to the problem, the time to sell all produced units remains the same, which suggests that the selling rate has adjusted to match the production increase.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nDays = 15,000 / 1500 = 10 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
