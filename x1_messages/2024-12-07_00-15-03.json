        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. To create a Node.js application that uploads a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, generates a signed URL for the uploaded file, and prints the URL to the console, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up a Google Cloud Project and enable Google Cloud Storage:**\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n   - Create a new project or select an existing one.\n   - Enable the Cloud Storage API for your project.\n   - Create a service account and download the JSON key file for authentication.\n\n2. **Install the required npm packages:**\n   - You'll need `@google-cloud/storage` for interacting with Google Cloud Storage.\n   - Install it using npm:\n     ```bash\n     npm install @google-cloud/storage\n     ```\n\n3. **Set up your Node.js application:**\n   - Create a new Node.js file, for example, `uploadFile.js`.\n\n4. **Write the code to upload a file and generate a signed URL:**\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Storage } = require('@google-cloud/storage');\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\n// Configuration\nconst storage = new Storage({\n  keyFilename: process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS,\n});\n\nconst bucketName = process.env.GCS_BUCKET_NAME;\nconst filePath = process.env.FILE_PATH;\nconst destinationFileName = process.env.DESTINATION_FILE_NAME;\nconst expirationTimeInSeconds = 3600; // 1 hour\n\nasync function uploadFileAndGenerateSignedUrl() {\n  try {\n    // Upload the file\n    await storage.bucket(bucketName).upload(filePath, {\n      destination: destinationFileName,\n    });\n    console.log(`${filePath} uploaded to ${bucketName}/${destinationFileName}`);\n\n    // Generate a signed URL\n    const options = {\n      version: 'v4',\n      action: 'read',\n      expires: Date.now() + expirationTimeInSeconds * 1000,\n    };\n    const [url] = await storage\n      .bucket(bucketName)\n      .file(destinationFileName)\n      .getSignedUrl(options);\n    console.log(`Signed URL: ${url}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error uploading file or generating signed URL:', error);\n  }\n}\n\nuploadFileAndGenerateSignedUrl();\n```\n\n5. **Set environment variables:**\n   - Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following content:\n     ```\n     GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/service-account-file.json\n     GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name\n     FILE_PATH=path/to/your/local/file.txt\n     DESTINATION_FILE_NAME=destination-file-name-in-bucket.txt\n     ```\n\n6. **Run the application:**\n   - Make sure you have `dotenv` installed to load environment variables:\n     ```bash\n     npm install dotenv\n     ```\n   - Run your script:\n     ```bash\n     node uploadFile.js\n     ```\n\nThis should upload the specified file to your Google Cloud Storage bucket and print a signed URL that can be used to access the file within the specified expiration time.\n\n**Note:** Ensure that the service account has the necessary permissions to upload files and generate signed URLs for the bucket."
