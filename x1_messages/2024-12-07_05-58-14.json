        "content": "So, there are 25 students in each class, and there are 12 classes in total. I need to find out how many students there are in the entire school.\n\nFirst, I should probably multiply the number of students in one class by the number of classes. So, that would be 25 students per class times 12 classes.\n\nLet me write that down: 25 students/class \u00d7 12 classes.\n\nNow, when I multiply these, the \"classes\" unit should cancel out, leaving me with just the number of students.\n\nSo, 25 \u00d7 12.\n\nI know that 25 times 10 is 250, and 25 times 2 is 50. So, adding those together, 250 + 50 equals 300.\n\nTherefore, there are 300 students in the school.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using addition instead of multiplication to double-check.\n\nIf each class has 25 students, then adding 25 twelve times should give me the total number of students.\n\nSo, 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25.\n\nThat's a lot of addition, but if I group them, it might be easier.\n\nLet's see, 25 + 25 is 50.\n\n50 + 25 is 75.\n\n75 + 25 is 100.\n\n100 + 25 is 125.\n\n125 + 25 is 150.\n\n150 + 25 is 175.\n\n175 + 25 is 200.\n\n200 + 25 is 225.\n\n225 + 25 is 250.\n\n250 + 25 is 275.\n\n275 + 25 is 300.\n\nOkay, that matches my multiplication result. So, there are definitely 300 students in the school.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can use another method.\n\nWhat if I consider that there are 12 classes, each with 25 students, and think about it in terms of dozens.\n\nI know that a dozen is 12, so 25 students per class times 12 classes is like 25 times 12.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could break down 25 into 20 + 5, and then multiply each by 12.\n\nSo, 20 \u00d7 12 is 240, and 5 \u00d7 12 is 60.\n\nThen, adding those together, 240 + 60 equals 300.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to say that there are 300 students in the school.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this number.\n\nFor example, are there any students who are not in these 12 classes? Maybe there are students in special programs or in different grades that aren't accounted for in these 12 classes.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems that all students are divided equally into these 12 classes, each with 25 students.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there are any other factors to consider.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in the school is 300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
