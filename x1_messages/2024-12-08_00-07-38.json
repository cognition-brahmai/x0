        "content": "Let's see. So, in this small town, every man has a unique name, which probably means that no two men share the same name. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, it's said that half of the men in the town have a beard. So, if we let the total number of men in the town be M, then the number of bearded men would be M/2.\n\nGiven that John is one of the bearded men, that doesn't change the overall proportion, I think. It's just providing a specific example to relate to the general statement.\n\nSo, if half of the men have beards, the other half must not have beards, right? So, the number of men without beards would also be M/2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of men who do not have a beard. So, if we know that half of them have beards, then the other half don't.\n\nHowever, without knowing the total number of men in the town, we can't give a specific number. We can only express it in terms of the total number of men.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nIf John is one of the bearded men, and he's a specific individual, does that give us any additional information about the total number of men in the town? Not really, because the statement is about proportions, not about specific individuals.\n\nSo, unless the total number of men is specified, we can't determine the exact number of men without beards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the unique naming has something to do with it, but I don't think so. Unique names just mean each man has a different name, which is probably standard in any population.\n\nMaybe there's a different approach. Let's consider that since John is a bearded man, and he's one of the half who have beards, but again, without knowing how many bearded men there are in total, we can't determine the number without beards.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a way to think about this differently. If half the men have beards, and John is one of them, then the number of men without beards would be equal to the number of bearded men.\n\nSo, if B is the number of bearded men, then the number of non-bearded men is also B, since B = M/2 and non-bearded men are M - B = M/2 = B.\n\nTherefore, the number of men without beards is equal to the number of bearded men.\n\nBut again, without knowing the actual number of bearded men or the total men, we can't give a specific number.\n\nUnless, perhaps, there's a way to infer the total number from the names being unique. But I don't see how that would help in determining the number of beardless men.\n\nMaybe the question is testing whether you understand that if half have beards, the other half don't, and that's all that can be concluded without more information.\n\nSo, my final answer would be that the number of men without beards is equal to the number of bearded men, which is half of the total number of men in the town.\n\nBut since the total number isn't specified, we can't give a numerical answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The number of men without beards is equal to half the total number of men in the town.}} \\]\n"
