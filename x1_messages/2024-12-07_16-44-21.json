A sunset is the daily phenomenon that marks the end of the daytime as the sun disappears below the horizon. The sky often displays a beautiful array of colors during this time, typically starting with shades of orange and yellow, transitioning into pinks and reds, and sometimes even purples and blues. The exact colors can vary depending on factors such as atmospheric conditions, pollution levels, and the presence of clouds. Many people find sunsets to be a serene and captivating natural spectacle."
