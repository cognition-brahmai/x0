        "content": "So the factory makes 200 widgets each day, but because of a machine issue, 5% of these widgets are defective and can't be sold. I need to find out how many widgets are not defective, meaning they're good to go and can be sold.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are defective. If 5% are defective, then I can calculate that by taking 5% of 200. To find 5% of something, I can multiply that something by 0.05. So, 200 multiplied by 0.05 should give me the number of defective widgets.\n\nLet me do that: 200 \u00d7 0.05 = 10. So, there are 10 defective widgets.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-defective widgets, I can subtract the defective ones from the total produced. That would be 200 minus 10.\n\n200 - 10 = 190.\n\nSo, the factory produces 190 non-defective widgets per day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of finding the defective ones first and then subtracting, I could directly calculate the non-defective percentage and apply that to the total.\n\nIf 5% are defective, then the remaining percentage should be non-defective. Since 100% is the total, subtracting the defective percentage would give me the non-defective percentage.\n\n100% - 5% = 95%.\n\nSo, 95% of the widgets are non-defective.\n\nNow, to find 95% of 200, I can multiply 200 by 0.95.\n\n200 \u00d7 0.95 = 190.\n\nAgain, I get 190 non-defective widgets.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 190 is the correct number of non-defective widgets produced per day.\n\nBut let's think about this a bit more. What if the factory increases its production? Or what if the defect rate changes? It might be useful to understand the general approach.\n\nSuppose the factory produces X widgets per day and the defect rate is Y%. Then, the number of defective widgets would be (Y/100) \u00d7 X, and the number of non-defective widgets would be X minus that, which is X - (Y/100)\u00d7X, which simplifies to X\u00d7(1 - Y/100).\n\nIn this specific case, X is 200 and Y is 5, so it's 200 \u00d7 (1 - 0.05) = 200 \u00d7 0.95 = 190.\n\nThis formula might be helpful if the numbers change.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that the defect rate is indeed 5% and that it's consistent each day. If the machine malfunctions differently on different days, the defect rate might vary, but based on the information given, we'll assume it's constant at 5%.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there's a way to reduce the defect rate by fixing the machine. But that's more about quality control and not directly related to this specific question.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the factory produces 190 non-defective widgets per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
