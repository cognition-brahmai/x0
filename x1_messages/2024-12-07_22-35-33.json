        "content": "So the farmer has 50 meters of fencing and he wants to make a rectangle to keep his sheep. He wants to know what's the biggest area he can enclose with that much fencing. Hmm, let's see how we can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I know that a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, right? So, if we call the length of one pair 'l' and the other pair 'w', then the perimeter would be 2l + 2w. And since he has 50 meters of fencing, that means 2l + 2w = 50.\n\nI can simplify that equation by dividing both sides by 2, which gives me l + w = 25. Okay, so the sum of the length and the width has to be 25 meters.\n\nNow, the area of a rectangle is length times width, so area = l * w. I need to maximize this area given that l + w = 25.\n\nLet me see. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. For example, w = 25 - l. Then, the area becomes A = l * (25 - l) = 25l - l\u00b2.\n\nSo, A = 25l - l\u00b2.\n\nThis looks like a quadratic equation, and its graph would be a parabola opening downwards because of the -l\u00b2 term. That means the maximum area would be at the vertex of the parabola.\n\nI recall that for a quadratic equation of the form y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the vertex is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, A = -l\u00b2 + 25l, so a = -1, b = 25.\n\nTherefore, the length that gives the maximum area is l = -25/(2*(-1)) = 25/2 = 12.5 meters.\n\nThen, width w = 25 - l = 25 - 12.5 = 12.5 meters.\n\nWait a minute, so both length and width are 12.5 meters? That makes it a square.\n\nIs that right? I thought a square might give the maximum area, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me check with other values to see if this is indeed the maximum.\n\nSuppose l = 10 meters, then w = 15 meters, and area A = 10 * 15 = 150 m\u00b2.\n\nIf l = 12 meters, w = 13 meters, A = 12 * 13 = 156 m\u00b2.\n\nIf l = 12.5 meters, w = 12.5 meters, A = 12.5 * 12.5 = 156.25 m\u00b2.\n\nOkay, that's higher.\n\nWhat if l = 13 meters, w = 12 meters, A = 13 * 12 = 156 m\u00b2.\n\nLess than 156.25.\n\nAnd if l = 14 meters, w = 11 meters, A = 14 * 11 = 154 m\u00b2.\n\nEven less.\n\nSo, indeed, the maximum area is when l = w = 12.5 meters, giving an area of 156.25 m\u00b2.\n\nIs there another way to confirm this?\n\nMaybe using calculus. If I have A = 25l - l\u00b2, then dA/dl = 25 - 2l.\n\nSetting dA/dl = 0 to find the maximum, so 25 - 2l = 0, which gives l = 12.5 meters. That matches.\n\nAnd the second derivative d\u00b2A/dl\u00b2 = -2, which is negative, confirming it's a maximum.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum area is 156.25 m\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, is there any restriction on the dimensions? Like, maybe the enclosure needs to be a certain shape or something.\n\nThe problem just says \"rectangular enclosure,\" so I think any rectangle is fine.\n\nAlso, is there any loss due to the fencing material or something? The problem doesn't mention that, so I assume the entire 50 meters is used for the perimeter.\n\nSo, I think 156.25 m\u00b2 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me just double-check with another approach.\n\nSuppose I fix one side, say length l, then width w = 25 - l.\n\nThen, area A = l * (25 - l).\n\nTo maximize A, I can consider it as a function of l and find its maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality.\n\nAM-GM inequality states that for positive numbers, (a + b)/2 >= sqrt(a*b), with equality when a = b.\n\nIn this case, l + w = 25, so (l + w)/2 >= sqrt(l*w).\n\nSo, 25/2 >= sqrt(A), with equality when l = w.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(A) <= 12.5, so A <= 156.25, with equality when l = w = 12.5.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the maximum area is 156.25 m\u00b2 when the rectangle is actually a square.\n\nSo, it seems consistent across different methods.\n\nTherefore, the farmer should make the enclosure a square with sides of 12.5 meters to maximize the area for his sheep.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{156.25} \\]"
