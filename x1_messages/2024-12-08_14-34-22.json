Hemingway was known for his minimalist and direct prose, so maybe a simpler haiku would do:\n\nPeaks pierce the sky,\nSolid in the storm's rage,\nEnduring power.\n\nOr perhaps:\n\nRugged mountains rise,\nUnyielding in their might,\nNature's sentinels.\n\nI think the key is to keep it straightforward and focus on the raw power and endurance of the mountains, which aligns with Hemingway's style of highlighting strength and resilience in the face of adversity.)"
