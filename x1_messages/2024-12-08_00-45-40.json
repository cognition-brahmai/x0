        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you want a Python script that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. The script should take a positive integer as input and return the factorial value.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNow, recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, this means a function calling itself with a simpler version of the original problem, until it reaches a base case that can be solved directly.\n\nFor factorial, the base case is when n is 0 or 1, because 0! = 1 and 1! = 1. For any n > 1, the factorial is n times the factorial of (n-1).\n\nSo, the recursive formula for factorial is:\n\n- If n == 0 or n == 1, return 1\n\n- Else, return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe'll need to define a function, let's call it factorial, that takes an integer n as input.\n\nFirst, we'll handle the base case:\n\nif n == 0 or n == 1:\n\nreturn 1\n\nThen, for n > 1:\n\nreturn n * factorial(n-1)\n\nThat's the recursive step.\n\nWe also need to ensure that the input is a positive integer. If someone passes a negative number or a non-integer, we should handle that appropriately.\n\nLet's consider adding some input validation.\n\nWe can check if n is an integer and if it's greater than or equal to 0.\n\nIf not, we can raise an exception or return an error message.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that the input will always be a positive integer, as per the user's request.\n\nSo, we don't need to add extra checks.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python script that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Factorial**: The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It's denoted by `n!`. For example, `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.\n\n2. **Recursion Concept**: Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, this means a function calling itself with a simpler version of the original problem until it reaches a base case that can be solved directly.\n\n3. **Base Case and Recursive Step**:\n   - **Base Case**: For factorial, when `n` is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.\n   - **Recursive Step**: For `n > 1`, the factorial is `n` times the factorial of `n-1`.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Define a function named `factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n   - Check if `n` is 0 or 1, and return 1 in these cases.\n   - For other values of `n`, call the `factorial` function recursively with `n-1` and multiply the result by `n`.\n\n5. **Assumptions**: Assume that the input will always be a positive integer to keep the script simple.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 5\nresult = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Function Definition**: The `factorial` function is defined to compute the factorial of a given number `n`.\n- **Base Case**: If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1.\n- **Recursive Case**: For `n > 1`, the function returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`.\n- **Example Usage**: The script calculates the factorial of 5 and prints \"The factorial of 5 is 120\".\n\nThis approach ensures that the factorial is calculated efficiently using recursion, adhering to the principles of recursive function design."
