Here's what I came up with:\n\n\"Just when you thought I couldn't get any cooler, BAM! I've done it again. Introducing the Stark Industries Quantum Reactor 3000 \u2013 because why not push the boundaries of science and redefine what's possible? This bad boy is going to revolutionize energy production and make those old fossil fuels look like yesterday's news.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Not only is it efficient beyond belief, but it's also infinitely sustainable. Yeah, that's right; infinite energy at your fingertips. Talk about powering the future!\n\nAnd, because I know you're all wondering, no, it doesn't come with a built-in AI assistant. Though, if you're lucky, JARVIS might pay a visit now and then to show off.\n\nSo, stay tuned for the official launch. Trust me; you won't want to miss this. #StarkIndustries #QuantumReactor3000 #FutureIsNow\"\n\nHow's that? Sounds like something Tony would say, right?"
