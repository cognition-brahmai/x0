Then, I put back 2 more apples. Adding those 2 back to the basket, 2 plus 2 equals 4 apples. So, now I have 4 apples in the basket.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Starting with 6 apples, taking away 4 leaves 2. Then adding back 2 gives me 4. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
