        "content": "So, we've got this problem here with four friends who need to cross a bridge at night. They've only got one flashlight, and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without it. The bridge can only hold a maximum of two people at a time. Each friend takes a different amount of time to cross: Alex takes 1 minute, Bob takes 2 minutes, Carol takes 5 minutes, and Dave takes 10 minutes. When two people cross together, they have to go at the slower person's pace. We need to figure out the minimum time it will take for all four of them to safely cross the bridge.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the constraints and what we need to optimize here. The main constraints are:\n\n1. Only two people can cross the bridge at a time.\n\n2. They need to use the flashlight to cross, and there's only one flashlight.\n\n3. When two people cross together, they go at the slower person's pace.\n\nOur goal is to minimize the total time taken for all four friends to cross the bridge.\n\nFirst, let's think about the basic approach. We need to get all four people across, so we'll need multiple trips across the bridge. Specifically, since only two can cross at a time, and someone needs to bring the flashlight back for others to cross, it's going to involve a few back-and-forth trips.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible sequence of trips:\n\n1. First, Alex and Bob cross together. Since Bob is slower, they take 2 minutes.\n\n2. Then, Alex goes back with the flashlight. That takes 1 minute.\n\n3. Next, Carol and Dave cross together. Since Dave is slower, they take 10 minutes.\n\n4. Then, Bob goes back with the flashlight. That takes 2 minutes.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nLet's add up the times:\n\n2 (first crossing) + 1 (Alex back) + 10 (Carol and Dave crossing) + 2 (Bob back) + 2 (Alex and Bob crossing again) = 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to do this faster than 17 minutes? Let's think about it.\n\nOne key is to minimize the time spent on return trips because those are necessary to bring the flashlight back. Since Alex is the fastest, maybe we can use Alex to make the return trips to save time.\n\nWait a minute, in the sequence I just outlined, Alex makes one return trip, and Bob makes one return trip. Maybe there's a way to have Alex make both return trips to save time.\n\nLet's try another sequence:\n\n1. Alex and Dave cross together. Since Dave is slower, they take 10 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight. That takes 1 minute.\n\n3. Alex and Carol cross together. Since Carol is slower, they take 5 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight. That takes 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 19 minutes.\n\nHmm, that's worse than the previous 17 minutes. So maybe the first approach is better.\n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter way to arrange the trips. Perhaps have the two slowest people cross together in one trip to get them both across, but then the return trip would take longer.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Bob goes back with the flashlight. That takes 2 minutes.\n\n3. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight. That takes 1 minute.\n\n5. Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes again.\n\nSame as the first approach.\n\nIs there a way to reduce this time further? Maybe by having someone else make the return trips.\n\nWait, what if we have the faster people make the return trips more often. Let's try having Bob make one return trip and Alex make the other.\n\n1. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight. That takes 1 minute.\n\n3. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight. That takes 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 10 = 24 minutes.\n\nThat's even worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have Alex and Carol cross together.\n\n1. Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight. That takes 1 minute.\n\n3. Bob and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Bob goes back with the flashlight. That takes 2 minutes.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 17 minutes.\n\nHmm, it seems like 17 minutes is the best I can come up with so far. Maybe 17 minutes is the minimum time.\n\nBut let me see if there's a more optimized way.\n\nI recall that in similar problems, the key is to minimize the time spent on return trips by having the fastest persons make the return trips.\n\nIn the initial approach, Alex (1 minute) makes one return trip, and Bob (2 minutes) makes one return trip, totaling 3 minutes for return trips.\n\nIs there a way to reduce the time spent on return trips?\n\nWhat if we can have only one return trip, or make the return trips faster?\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to arrange the crossings so that there are fewer return trips.\n\nLet's think differently. Suppose we have two pairs cross simultaneously, but that's not possible since only two can cross at a time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have someone cross multiple times to minimize the total time.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to have someone stay on the other side so that they can bring the flashlight back sooner.\n\nLet me try another sequence:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight. That takes 1 minute.\n\n3. Now, instead of crossing with Carol and Dave, maybe have Alex cross with Carol, taking 5 minutes.\n\n4. Bob goes back with the flashlight. That takes 2 minutes.\n\n5. Finally, Bob and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 10 = 20 minutes.\n\nAgain, higher than 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n2. Carol goes back with the flashlight. That takes 5 minutes.\n\n3. Bob and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Bob goes back with the flashlight. That takes 2 minutes.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 5 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 24 minutes.\n\nWorse still.\n\nAnother idea: Have the two fastest cross first.\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Bob goes back with the flashlight. That takes 2 minutes.\n\n3. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight. That takes 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nIs there a way to overlap some of these trips or have someone already on the other side to reduce the time?\n\nWait, maybe we can have Alex and Bob cross first, then Alex goes back, then Alex and Carol cross, then Alex goes back, then Alex and Dave cross.\n\nBut that totals 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes, which is worse.\n\nAlternatively, have Alex and Dave cross first, taking 10 minutes.\n\nThen Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nThen Bob and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\nThen Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nFinally, Alex and Dave cross again, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 27 minutes.\n\nEven worse.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way to pair them.\n\nLet's consider having Bob and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\nThen Bob goes back, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen Alex and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nThen Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nFinally, Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 17 minutes.\n\nIt seems like no matter how I arrange it, I can't get below 17 minutes.\n\nMaybe 17 minutes is indeed the minimum time.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to have both return trips made by Alex, the fastest person.\n\nLet's try:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, have Alex and Dave cross first, taking 10 minutes.\n\nThen Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nThen Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nFinally, Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 19 minutes.\n\nAgain, 19 minutes.\n\nNot better than 17 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider having the two slowest people cross together in the first trip.\n\nLet's try:\n\n1. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n2. Carol goes back with the flashlight, taking 5 minutes.\n\n3. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Carol and Dave cross together again, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 10 = 28 minutes.\n\nEven worse.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n2. Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\n3. Bob and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Carol cross together again, taking 5 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 23 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 17 minutes.\n\nIt seems like no matter how I arrange it, I can't get below 17 minutes.\n\nMaybe 17 minutes is the minimum time.\n\nBut let me see if there's a more optimized approach.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to have both return trips made by Alex, but in a more efficient manner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to have someone already on the other side to facilitate faster return trips.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose Alex and Bob cross first, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nNow, Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\nSo far, that's 2 + 1 + 5 = 8 minutes.\n\nNow, instead of Alex going back, maybe Bob goes back, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen, Bob and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time so far: 8 + 2 + 10 = 20 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\nFinally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 20 + 1 + 2 = 23 minutes.\n\nHigher than 17 minutes.\n\nNot better.\n\nAlternatively, after Alex and Carol cross, maybe Carol goes back, but that would take 5 minutes, which is not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to have the faster persons make multiple trips.\n\nBut it seems like that just extends the total time.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose Alex and Dave cross together first, taking 10 minutes.\n\nThen, Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\nWait, but Bob can't go back alone if Alex is already on the other side.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n1. Alex and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n2. Dave stays there, and Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Then, Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight again, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 19 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Then, Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes.\n\nAgain, 19 minutes.\n\nNot better than 17 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have Carol and Dave cross together earlier.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n2. Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\nWait, but Bob can't go back if he's not there yet.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Then, Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIt seems like I keep ending up with 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to break this pattern and get a lower time?\n\nWait, perhaps if we can have someone make a return trip faster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to have two people cross and then have one of them come back.\n\nWait, but with the constraints, I don't see a way to do it faster.\n\nLet me consider the total time spent on return trips.\n\nIn the 17-minute scenario:\n\n- Alex goes back once, taking 1 minute.\n\n- Bob goes back once, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal return time: 3 minutes.\n\nThe crossing times are:\n\n- Alex and Bob: 2 minutes\n\n- Carol and Dave: 10 minutes\n\n- Alex and Bob again: 2 minutes\n\nTotal crossing time: 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 14 + 3 = 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to reduce the return time or overlap some of the trips?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps accept that 17 minutes is the minimum time.\n\nBut I recall that in similar problems, sometimes there are tricks to minimize the time further.\n\nWait, perhaps if we have Alex and Carol cross together, then have Bob and Dave cross together, but that would take longer.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Bob and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Carol goes back with the flashlight, taking 5 minutes.\n\n5. Alex and Carol cross together again, taking 5 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 1 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 26 minutes.\n\nWorse than 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\n3. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nAgain, 17 minutes.\n\nIt seems like no matter how I arrange it, I can't get below 17 minutes.\n\nMaybe 17 minutes is indeed the minimum time required for all four friends to cross the bridge safely.\n\nBut let me check if there's a more optimized approach that I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps if we have Alex and Carol cross first, then Alex goes back, then Alex and Dave cross, then Alex goes back again, and finally Alex and Bob cross.\n\nBut that would take 5 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 19 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, have Bob and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\nThen Bob goes back, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen Alex and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nThen Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nFinally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 17 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have multiple people moving at the same time, but given the constraints, only two can cross at a time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps accept that 17 minutes is the minimum time.\n\nBut let me see if I can find a way to reduce it to 16 minutes or less.\n\nSuppose we have Alex and Bob cross first, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nThen, Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nNow, instead of Alex going back, maybe Dave goes back, but that would take 10 minutes, which is not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, have Bob go back, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, have Alex and Dave cross first, taking 10 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nThen, Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex goes back again, taking 1 minute.\n\nFinally, Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 19 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 17 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have Carol and Dave cross earlier.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n2. Carol goes back with the flashlight, taking 5 minutes.\n\n3. Bob and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 5 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 24 minutes.\n\nHigher than 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Alex and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes.\n\nAgain, higher than 17 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have two people cross and then have one of them stay while the other brings the flashlight back.\n\nBut given that we need all four to cross, someone has to bring the flashlight back each time, except possibly for the last trip.\n\nWait, perhaps the last trip doesn't need the flashlight brought back, because everyone is already on the other side.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in the initial approach:\n\n- First crossing: Alex and Bob, 2 minutes.\n\n- Return: Alex, 1 minute.\n\n- Second crossing: Carol and Dave, 10 minutes.\n\n- Return: Bob, 2 minutes.\n\n- Final crossing: Alex and Bob, 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to reduce this time by having the return trips take less time?\n\nWait, what if instead of Bob going back for the second return trip, someone faster goes back.\n\nBut the only faster person is Alex, who has already made one return trip.\n\nIf Alex makes both return trips, that would be:\n\n- First crossing: Alex and Bob, 2 minutes.\n\n- Return: Alex, 1 minute.\n\n- Second crossing: Carol and Dave, 10 minutes.\n\n- Return: Alex, 1 minute.\n\n- Final crossing: Alex and Bob, 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 16 minutes.\n\nWait a second, that's 16 minutes. That's better than 17 minutes.\n\nBut in this scenario, Alex and Bob are both on the starting side after the second return trip, and Carol and Dave are on the other side.\n\nThen, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes, for a total of 16 minutes.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nWait, let's verify the sequence:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight again, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 16 minutes.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nSo, in this sequence, Alex makes two return trips, which makes sense because Alex is the fastest.\n\nTherefore, the minimum time is 16 minutes, not 17 minutes as I initially thought.\n\nI must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 16 minutes.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this.\n\nAfter the first crossing (Alex and Bob, 2 minutes), Alex goes back (1 minute), total 3 minutes.\n\nThen, Carol and Dave cross together (10 minutes), bringing the total to 13 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex goes back again (1 minute), total 14 minutes.\n\nFinally, Alex and Bob cross together again (2 minutes), total 16 minutes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the minimum time is 16 minutes.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I had 17 minutes, and this one is 16 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to make it even faster?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I try to have Bob make one of the return trips, it would take longer because Bob takes 2 minutes to go back, whereas Alex takes only 1 minute.\n\nSo, having Alex make both return trips seems to be the fastest possible.\n\nIs there a way to eliminate one of the return trips?\n\nWell, in this scenario, we have two return trips: one by Alex and one by Alex again.\n\nIf we could reduce the number of return trips, maybe we could save time.\n\nBut with four people, and only two can cross at a time, it seems like we need at least two return trips.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTotal crossings needed: two crossings to get all four across, but with the flashlight needing to be brought back each time after the first crossing.\n\nWait, actually, in the final crossing, the flashlight doesn't need to be brought back because everyone is already on the other side.\n\nSo, only one return trip is needed if we can arrange it properly.\n\nBut in this problem, because we have four people, and the bridge can only hold two at a time, we need at least two return trips.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we have:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\n5. Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if Alex makes both return trips:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight again, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 16 minutes.\n\nThis seems to be the most optimized sequence.\n\nIs there a way to make it 15 minutes?\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf Alex makes both return trips, and the crossing times are 2, 1, 10, 1, 2, totaling 16 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to overlap some of these times or have someone else make a faster return trip?\n\nBut Alex is already the fastest, so having Alex make both return trips seems optimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimum time is 16 minutes.\n\nWait, but I recall that in similar problems, sometimes the minimum time is 17 minutes.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check another sequence.\n\nSuppose:\n\n1. Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Bob and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nHigher than 16 minutes.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Alex and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n2. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight again, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 19 minutes.\n\nAgain, higher than 16 minutes.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Bob and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\n2. Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\n3. Alex and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 5 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 16 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have Carol make a return trip, but that would take 5 minutes, which is not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have Dave make a return trip, but that would take 10 minutes, which is even worse.\n\nTherefore, it seems that having Alex make both return trips is the most time-efficient approach, resulting in a total time of 16 minutes.\n\nBut let me see if there's a way to make it even faster.\n\nSuppose Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nThen, Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\nNow, instead of Alex going back again, have Bob go back, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nThat's higher than 16 minutes.\n\nSo, still not better.\n\nAlternatively, have Alex make the first return trip, then Bob make the second return trip.\n\nBut that would take longer.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n\n2. Bob goes back with the flashlight, taking 2 minutes.\n\n3. Carol and Dave cross together, taking 10 minutes.\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight, taking 1 minute.\n\n5. Finally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nAgain, 17 minutes.\n\nStill higher than 16 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the 16-minute sequence seems to be the optimal one.\n\nIs there a way to make it 15 minutes?\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf we could reduce one of the return trips by 1 minute, but Alex already takes 1 minute for each return trip.\n\nSo, two return trips take 2 minutes in total.\n\nThe crossing times are 2 minutes (Alex and Bob), 10 minutes (Carol and Dave), and again 2 minutes (Alex and Bob).\n\nTotal: 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 minutes.\n\nPlus return trips: 1 + 1 = 2 minutes.\n\nTotal: 16 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to have only one return trip?\n\nMaybe if we can have someone already on the other side to bring the flashlight back.\n\nBut with four people, and only two can cross at a time, it seems unavoidable to have at least two return trips.\n\nWait, perhaps if we have Alex and Bob cross first, then Alex goes back, then Alex and Carol cross, then Alex goes back again, and finally Alex and Dave cross.\n\nBut that would take 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes.\n\nHigher than 16 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, have Alex and Dave cross first, taking 10 minutes.\n\nThen, Alex goes back, taking 1 minute.\n\nThen, Bob and Carol cross together, taking 5 minutes.\n\nThen, Bob goes back, taking 2 minutes.\n\nFinally, Alex and Bob cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nHigher than 16 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have Carol make a return trip earlier.\n\nBut that would take 5 minutes, which isn't efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have Dave make a return trip, but that would take 10 minutes.\n\nNot efficient at all.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the minimum time is indeed 16 minutes.\n\nBut I recall that in similar problems, the minimal time is sometimes 17 minutes, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider if there's a constraint that I'm not adhering to.\n\nWait, perhaps having Alex make two return trips is not allowed because it's too tiring for him.\n\nBut in this problem, there's no such constraint mentioned.\n\nTherefore, it should be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence I've proposed isn't valid for some reason.\n\nBut looking at it step by step, it seems fine.\n\n1. Alex and Bob cross together (2 minutes).\n\n2. Alex goes back (1 minute).\n\n3. Carol and Dave cross together (10 minutes).\n\n4. Alex goes back (1 minute).\n\n5. Alex and Bob cross together again (2 minutes).\n\nTotal time: 16 minutes.\n\nEveryone is now on the other side, and the flashlight is with them.\n\nTherefore, the minimum time is 16 minutes.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check another sequence.\n\nSuppose:\n\n1. Alex and Carol cross together (5 minutes).\n\n2. Carol goes back with the flashlight (5 minutes).\n\n3. Bob and Dave cross together (10 minutes).\n\n4. Bob goes back with the flashlight (2 minutes).\n\n5. Alex and Bob cross together again (2 minutes).\n\nTotal time: 5 + 5 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 24 minutes.\n\nHigher than 16 minutes.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Bob and Dave cross together (10 minutes).\n\n2. Bob goes back with the flashlight (2 minutes).\n\n3. Alex and Carol cross together (5 minutes).\n\n4. Alex goes back with the flashlight (1 minute).\n\n5. Alex and Bob cross together again (2 minutes).\n\nTotal time: 10 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nAgain, higher than 16 minutes.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Alex and Dave cross together (10 minutes).\n\n2. Dave goes back with the flashlight (10 minutes).\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because Dave is already on the other side.\n\nWait, no, after the first crossing, Dave is on the other side, and Alex goes back with the flashlight.\n\nBut that would take 10 minutes for the return trip, which is inefficient.\n\nSo, that's not a good approach.\n\nTherefore, it seems that having Alex make both return trips is indeed the most time-efficient method.\n\nHence, the minimum time required for all four friends to cross the bridge safely is 16 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
