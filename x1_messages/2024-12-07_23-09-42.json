        "content": "So I've got this problem about a car park with multiple levels, and I need to figure out how many cars it can hold in total. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the car park has 4 levels. That means there are 4 separate floors or areas where cars can be parked. Each level has 15 rows, and each row has 8 parking spaces. So, to find the total number of parking spaces, I need to multiply these numbers together.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal parking spaces = number of levels \u00d7 number of rows per level \u00d7 number of spaces per row\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal parking spaces = 4 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 8\n\nNow, I can do this multiplication in steps. First, multiply the number of levels by the number of rows per level:\n\n4 levels \u00d7 15 rows/level = 60 rows\n\nThen, multiply the total number of rows by the number of spaces per row:\n\n60 rows \u00d7 8 spaces/row = 480 spaces\n\nSo, the car park can hold a maximum of 480 cars.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way is to first calculate the number of spaces per level. Each level has 15 rows with 8 spaces each, so:\n\nSpaces per level = 15 rows \u00d7 8 spaces/row = 120 spaces\n\nThen, since there are 4 levels, the total number of spaces would be:\n\nTotal spaces = 4 levels \u00d7 120 spaces/level = 480 spaces\n\nThat matches my previous calculation, which is a good sign.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect the total capacity. For example, are there any reserved spaces or obstacles that might reduce the number of parking spaces? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume that all spaces are available for parking.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"maximum capacity,\" which implies that we're considering all parking spaces being filled without any restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the car park can hold a maximum of 480 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480} \\]"
