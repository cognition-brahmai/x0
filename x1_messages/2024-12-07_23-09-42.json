        "content": "If a car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, to find out how many miles it will cover in 45 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours since the speed is given in miles per hour.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 45 minutes is:\n\n45 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 0.75 hours\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 0.75 hours = 45 miles\n\nTherefore, the car will cover 45 miles in 45 minutes.\n\n**Alternative method:**\n\nSince 60 miles per hour means the car covers 60 miles in 60 minutes, we can set up a proportion to find out how many miles it covers in 45 minutes.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the distance covered in 45 minutes as \\( d \\).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{d \\text{ miles}}{45 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles} \\times 45 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 45 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same result: 45 miles.\n\n**Another approach:**\n\nWe can also think in terms of fractions. Since 45 minutes is 3/4 of an hour (because 45 \u00f7 60 = 0.75), we can calculate:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 3/4 hour = 45 miles\n\nAll these methods confirm that the car will travel 45 miles in 45 minutes at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Additional insight:**\n\nIt's important to ensure that the units are consistent when using the formula Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time. In this case, speed is in miles per hour, and time needs to be in hours. That's why we converted 45 minutes to 0.75 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to work with minutes, you can convert the speed to miles per minute.\n\nFirst, convert 60 miles per hour to miles per minute:\n\n60 miles per hour \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 1 mile per minute\n\nNow, for 45 minutes:\n\nDistance = 1 mile per minute \u00d7 45 minutes = 45 miles\n\nThis again confirms our previous calculations.\n\n**Real-world consideration:**\n\nIn real-world scenarios, average speed can vary due to traffic, speed limits, and other factors. However, for the purpose of this problem, we assume a constant average speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Practice problem:**\n\nIf a car travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, how many miles will it cover in 30 minutes?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nFirst, convert 30 minutes to hours:\n\n30 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours\n\nThen, use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 50 miles per hour \u00d7 0.5 hours = 25 miles\n\nTherefore, the car will cover 25 miles in 30 minutes.\n\n**Another practice problem:**\n\nA runner maintains an average speed of 8 miles per hour. How far will the runner travel in 15 minutes?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nFirst, convert 15 minutes to hours:\n\n15 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 0.25 hours\n\nThen, calculate the distance:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 8 miles per hour \u00d7 0.25 hours = 2 miles\n\nSo, the runner will travel 2 miles in 15 minutes.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nTo find the distance traveled given speed and time, ensure that the units for speed and time are compatible (e.g., miles per hour and hours). Convert time to the appropriate unit if necessary, then apply the formula Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n- Understand unit conversions, especially between hours and minutes.\n\n- Consistency in units is crucial in calculations involving speed, time, and distance.\n\n- Multiple methods can be used to solve the same problem, leading to the same conclusion.\n\n**Challenge problem:**\n\nIf a cyclist rides at an average speed of 15 miles per hour, how long will it take to cover 10 miles? Provide the answer in minutes.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to find the time it takes to cover a certain distance at a given speed. The formula is:\n\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 10 miles \u00f7 15 miles per hour = 0.6667 hours\n\nTo convert hours to minutes, multiply by 60 minutes per hour:\n\n0.6667 hours \u00d7 60 minutes per hour \u2248 40 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately 40 minutes to cover 10 miles at an average speed of 15 miles per hour.\n\n**Note:**\n\nIn this challenge problem, we used the formula Time = Distance \u00f7 Speed, which is derived from the original formula Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time. This highlights the relationship between these three variables and how they can be manipulated to solve for different unknowns.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nMastering the relationship between speed, time, and distance is fundamental in many real-life situations, from planning travel to understanding motion in physics. By practicing these types of problems, you can enhance your ability to work with rates and units, which are essential skills in mathematics and science."
