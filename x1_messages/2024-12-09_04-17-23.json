        "content": "So there are 25 students in the class, and half of them wear glasses. To find out how many don't wear glasses, I need to figure out what half of 25 is and then subtract that from the total number of students.\n\nFirst, let's find half of 25. Half means dividing by 2. So, 25 divided by 2 is 12.5. But we're talking about students, and you can't have half a student, so that seems a bit tricky.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it differently. If half of the students wear glasses, that means the other half don't wear glasses. So, if I calculate half of 25 and get 12.5, then the number of students who don't wear glasses should also be 12.5. But again, that doesn't make sense because you can't have half a student.\n\nPerhaps the problem assumes that exactly half wear glasses, but since 25 is an odd number, it's not possible to have exactly half wear glasses. Maybe the problem expects us to round down or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that 12 students wear glasses and 13 don't, or vice versa. But that wouldn't be exactly half.\n\nWait, maybe the problem has a mistake, or perhaps it's assuming that half means 12.5 students wear glasses, and similarly, 12.5 don't.\n\nBut in reality, the number of students who don't wear glasses would be 25 minus the number who wear glasses. If half wear glasses, that's 12.5, and 25 minus 12.5 is 12.5.\n\nI think the answer is 12.5 students don't wear glasses, but since we're dealing with people, it's unusual to have half a person. Maybe the problem expects us to consider that you can't have half a student, so perhaps it's 12 or 13 students don't wear glasses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to illustrate that with an odd number of students, you can't have exactly half wear glasses, so the number of students who don't wear glasses is not exactly half.\n\nI'm a bit confused about how to interpret this. Maybe I should just go with the mathematical approach: half of 25 is 12.5, so 12.5 students wear glasses, and 12.5 don't.\n\nBut in practical terms, you'd have to round or adjust. Maybe the answer is that 12 students wear glasses and 13 don't, or 13 wear glasses and 12 don't.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is 12.5 students don't wear glasses, but acknowledging that in reality, you can't have half a student.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12.5} \\]"
