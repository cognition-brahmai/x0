        "content": "So there's this store having a sale where everything is discounted by 10%. A customer wants to buy a shirt that normally costs $50. We need to find out how much the customer will pay after the discount is applied.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 10% discount means. Percentage discount is a reduction in price based on a percentage of the original price. So, 10% off means the customer saves 10% of the original price.\n\nTo calculate the discount amount, I can multiply the original price by the discount percentage. But I need to remember that percentages need to be converted to decimals for multiplication. 10% as a decimal is 0.10.\n\nSo, discount amount = original price \u00d7 discount percentage\nDiscount amount = $50 \u00d7 0.10\nDiscount amount = $5\n\nNow, to find the final price the customer has to pay, I subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n\nFinal price = original price - discount amount\nFinal price = $50 - $5\nFinal price = $45\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the customer paying 90% of the original price, since they're getting a 10% discount. So, 90% of $50 would also be $45.\n\nLet me verify that:\n90% as a decimal is 0.90\nFinal price = original price \u00d7 (1 - discount percentage)\nFinal price = $50 \u00d7 0.90\nFinal price = $45\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the customer will pay $45 for the shirt after the 10% discount is applied.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
