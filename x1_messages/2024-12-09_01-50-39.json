        "content": "To address the user's request to calculate the total sales per region from a given spreadsheet, I need to select the appropriate function and set the necessary parameters accordingly. Given the available functions, \"spreadsheet_analytics\" seems directly relevant for this task, whereas \"email_search\" is intended for locating emails and doesn't pertain to data analysis in spreadsheets.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on the \"spreadsheet_analytics\" function. The user wants to calculate the total sales per region, which suggests that there is a spreadsheet containing sales data categorized by regions. To perform this calculation, I need to identify the column that represents sales and the column that represents regions.\n\nAssuming that the spreadsheet has at least two columns: one for \"Sales\" and another for \"Region\", I can proceed with selecting the operation and specifying the columns.\n\nFrom the parameters listed for \"spreadsheet_analytics\", there is an \"operation\" parameter where I can specify the type of calculation to perform. Since the user wants the total sales, the appropriate operation would be \"sum\".\n\nNext, I need to specify the \"column\" parameter, which should be set to the column that contains the sales data. Assuming the sales data is in a column named \"Sales\", I'll set the column parameter to \"Sales\".\n\nAdditionally, the user wants to calculate the total sales per region, which implies grouping the data by region before performing the sum operation. Therefore, I need to use the \"group_by\" parameter and set it to the \"Region\" column.\n\nPutting it all together, the function to use is \"spreadsheet_analytics\" with the following parameters:\n\n- operation: sum\n\n- column: Sales\n\n- group_by: Region\n\nThis configuration will instruct the spreadsheet analytics tool to sum up the values in the \"Sales\" column, grouped by the different regions specified in the \"Region\" column, thereby providing the total sales per region.\n\nI should also consider if there are any additional parameters or options that might be necessary, such as filtering the data based on certain criteria or handling missing values. However, based on the user's request, which is straightforward, these additional settings may not be required at this stage.\n\nIn summary, by selecting the \"spreadsheet_analytics\" function with the specified parameters, I can effectively calculate the total sales per region from the given spreadsheet.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo calculate the total sales per region from the given spreadsheet, use the `spreadsheet_analytics` function with the following parameters:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: spreadsheet_analytics\nparameters:\n  operation: sum\n  column: Sales\n  group_by: Region\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Selected**: `spreadsheet_analytics`\n- **Operation**: `sum` - to calculate the total sales.\n- **Column**: `Sales` - the column containing sales data.\n- **Group By**: `Region` - to aggregate sales data by different regions.\n\nThis configuration will sum the sales data grouped by each region, providing the total sales per region."
