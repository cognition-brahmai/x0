        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 250 units every hour, and it operates for 16 hours a day. First, I need to find out how many units it produces in one day. So, I'll multiply the hourly production by the number of hours it operates daily.\n\nThat is: 250 units/hour * 16 hours/day = 4,000 units/day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production, I need to know how many days it operates in a week. Typically, a week has 7 days, so I'll multiply the daily production by 7.\n\nSo, 4,000 units/day * 7 days/week = 28,000 units/week.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there any other factor I need to consider, like weekends or breaks? The question says the factory operates for 16 hours a day, but it doesn't specify if it operates on all seven days of the week. Maybe it doesn't operate on weekends?\n\nLet me read the question again: \"the factory operates for 16 hours a day.\" It doesn't specify which days, so perhaps it operates every day of the week. But to be sure, I should assume it operates 7 days a week unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 16 hours a day include only certain days. For example, it might operate 16 hours on weekdays and fewer on weekends. But since it's not specified, I think the safe assumption is that it operates 16 hours every day of the week.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any holidays or shutdowns in a week, but again, since the question doesn't mention any, I'll proceed with 16 hours per day for 7 days.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial calculation: 250 units/hour * 16 hours/day * 7 days/week = 28,000 units/week.\n\nBut let me verify the math to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, 250 multiplied by 16:\n\n250 * 16 = 4,000 units per day.\n\nThen, 4,000 units per day multiplied by 7 days:\n\n4,000 * 7 = 28,000 units per week.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in a different way to confirm. If the factory operates 16 hours a day for 7 days, that's a total of 16 * 7 = 112 hours per week.\n\nThen, producing 250 units per hour for 112 hours would be:\n\n250 * 112 = 28,000 units per week.\n\nSame result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 28,000 units per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28000} \\]"
