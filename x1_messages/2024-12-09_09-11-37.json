        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a shipping company that wants to optimize its fleet by replacing some of its older ships with newer, more fuel-efficient ones. They currently have 50 ships, each consuming an average of 150 tons of fuel per month. The new ships are 20% more fuel-efficient, but they cost more upfront. The company is planning to replace 30% of its fleet. We need to calculate the potential monthly fuel savings and the time required to recoup the additional investment in the new ships, given that fuel costs $600 per ton.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many ships the company is planning to replace. They want to replace 30% of their fleet of 50 ships.\n\nNumber of ships to replace = 30% of 50\n= 0.30 * 50\n= 15 ships\n\nSo, they're replacing 15 ships.\n\nNext, we need to understand the fuel consumption of the new ships. The new ships are 20% more fuel-efficient. That means they consume 20% less fuel than the old ships.\n\nFuel consumption of old ships = 150 tons per month per ship\n\nFuel savings per new ship = 20% of 150 tons\n= 0.20 * 150\n= 30 tons per month\n\nTherefore, each new ship consumes 150 - 30 = 120 tons per month.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total fuel consumption before and after the replacement to find the monthly fuel savings.\n\nTotal fuel consumption before replacement:\n\n50 ships * 150 tons per ship per month\n= 7,500 tons per month\n\nAfter replacing 15 ships with the new, more efficient ones:\n\nFuel consumption of 35 old ships:\n35 ships * 150 tons per ship per month\n= 5,250 tons per month\n\nFuel consumption of 15 new ships:\n15 ships * 120 tons per ship per month\n= 1,800 tons per month\n\nTotal fuel consumption after replacement:\n5,250 + 1,800 = 7,050 tons per month\n\nSo, the monthly fuel savings would be:\n\n7,500 tons (before) - 7,050 tons (after) = 450 tons per month\n\nNow, we need to calculate the monthly cost savings based on the fuel savings. Given that fuel costs $600 per ton:\n\nMonthly fuel cost savings:\n450 tons * $600 per ton\n= $270,000 per month\n\nThat's the monthly savings.\n\nNext, we need to find out the time required to recoup the additional investment in the new ships. For that, we need to know the additional cost of the new ships compared to the old ones.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- C_old: cost of one old ship\n\n- C_new: cost of one new ship\n\nThe additional cost per new ship is C_new - C_old.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the costs of the old and new ships, we'll have to assume that the additional cost is the difference between the new and old ship prices.\n\nHowever, without specific values for C_old and C_new, we can't calculate the exact additional investment. But perhaps the problem expects us to express the payback time in terms of the additional cost per ship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the additional cost is related to the fuel savings. But that seems circular.\n\nWait, perhaps the company is looking at the additional cost of the new ships and wants to know how long it will take to recover that extra cost through fuel savings.\n\nLet's assume that the new ships cost more than the old ones, and the difference is the additional investment.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Delta_C: additional cost per new ship (C_new - C_old)\n\nThen, the total additional investment for 15 new ships would be:\n\nTotal additional investment = 15 * Delta_C\n\nThe monthly savings are $270,000, as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the time required to recoup the additional investment (payback period) would be:\n\nPayback period (in months) = Total additional investment / Monthly savings\n= (15 * Delta_C) / 270,000\n\nBut since we don't have the value of Delta_C, we can't compute a numerical value for the payback period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to express the payback period in terms of Delta_C.\n\nFor example:\n\nPayback period (in months) = (15 * Delta_C) / 270,000\n\nSimplifying:\n\n= Delta_C / 18,000\n\nSo, the payback period is Delta_C divided by 18,000 months.\n\nBut this doesn't make much sense because Delta_C is in dollars, and 18,000 is in dollars, so the units would be dollars divided by dollars per month, which is months.\n\nWait, actually, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem provides the cost difference or some way to calculate Delta_C.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"A shipping company wants to optimize its fleet by replacing older vessels with newer, more fuel-efficient ships. The company currently operates 50 ships, each consuming an average of 150 tons of fuel per month. Newer ships consume 20% less fuel but have a higher upfront cost. If the company replaces 30% of its fleet, calculate the potential monthly fuel savings and the time required to recoup the additional investment in new ships, assuming a fuel cost of $600 per ton.\"\n\nIt doesn't provide the cost of the old or new ships, or the difference in cost per ship. Without this information, we cannot calculate the exact payback period.\n\nHowever, perhaps we can express the payback period in terms of the additional cost per ship.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nPayback period (in months) = (15 * Delta_C) / 270,000\n= Delta_C / 18,000\n\nSo, for each additional dollar per ship, the payback period increases by 1/18,000 months.\n\nAlternatively, if we had the value of Delta_C, we could plug it in to find the exact payback period.\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide Delta_C, perhaps it's expected to express the payback period in terms of Delta_C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the additional cost is proportional to the fuel savings.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based solely on fuel savings, ignoring the additional upfront cost.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense, as the payback period is specifically about recovering the additional investment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period in terms of fuel savings alone, assuming that the additional cost is the only factor.\n\nBut without the additional cost, we can't calculate the payback period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based on the fuel cost savings.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects to calculate how many months it would take for the fuel savings to cover the additional investment.\n\nBut without knowing the additional investment, we can't calculate the number of months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to express the payback period in terms of the additional cost per ship.\n\nFor example, if the additional cost per new ship is X dollars, then the payback period is Y months.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any variables, so it might be expecting numerical answers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based on the fuel savings alone, assuming that the additional investment is equal to the present value of the future fuel savings.\n\nBut that's more complicated and probably not expected at this level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the additional cost is equal to the present value of the fuel savings over a certain period.\n\nBut again, without specific information, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based on the annual fuel savings.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period in years, not months.\n\nBut the fuel savings are given per month, so it's consistent to calculate the payback period in months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period in months and then convert it to years.\n\nBut again, without the additional investment, we can't calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based on the fuel savings per month and an assumed additional cost.\n\nBut without that assumption, we can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based on the fuel savings and the additional cost per ship, but since the additional cost isn't provided, perhaps it's not possible to calculate the exact payback period.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the problem only expects the calculation of the monthly fuel savings, and not the payback period.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks for both the potential monthly fuel savings and the time required to recoup the additional investment.\n\nGiven that we can calculate the monthly fuel savings but not the payback period without additional information, perhaps the problem expects only the fuel savings calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is additional information implied or provided elsewhere that gives the cost difference between old and new ships.\n\nBut in the given problem statement, no such information is provided.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed to calculate only the monthly fuel savings, which is $270,000, and note that the payback period cannot be calculated without knowing the additional investment required for the new ships.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a standard method to calculate the payback period in such scenarios, but without the cost difference, it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based on the fuel savings and the additional cost per ship, expressing the payback period in terms of Delta_C.\n\nIn that case, the payback period is Delta_C / 18,000 months, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut this seems incomplete without a numerical value for Delta_C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to assume that the additional cost is recovered solely through fuel savings, and to calculate the payback period accordingly.\n\nBut again, without the additional cost, this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based on the fuel savings and an assumed interest rate or other financial factors.\n\nBut that seems beyond the scope of the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period in years, not months.\n\nBut again, without the additional cost, it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based on the annual fuel savings.\n\nWait, let's calculate the annual fuel savings.\n\nMonthly fuel savings: $270,000\n\nAnnual fuel savings: 270,000 * 12 = $3,240,000 per year\n\nNow, if we had the total additional investment, the payback period would be:\n\nPayback period (in years) = Total additional investment / Annual fuel savings\n= Total additional investment / 3,240,000\n\nBut again, without the total additional investment, we can't calculate the payback period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to express the payback period in terms of the additional cost per ship.\n\nFor example:\n\nPayback period (in years) = (15 * Delta_C) / 3,240,000\n= Delta_C / 216,000\n\nSo, for each additional dollar per ship, the payback period increases by 1/216,000 years.\n\nBut this still doesn't give a numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem provides the cost difference elsewhere, but in the given problem statement, it's not present.\n\nTherefore, I will conclude that with the given information, we can calculate the monthly fuel savings but not the payback period.\n\nMonthly fuel savings: $270,000 per month\n\nPayback period: cannot be calculated without the additional investment information.\n\nAlternatively, expressing the payback period in terms of Delta_C:\n\nPayback period (in months) = Delta_C / 18,000\n\nOr, payback period (in years) = Delta_C / 216,000\n\nBut this is likely not the intended answer, as it's expressed in terms of an unknown variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to assume that the additional cost is recovered solely through fuel savings, and to calculate the payback period accordingly.\n\nBut without a numerical value for the additional cost, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the payback period based on the fuel savings and the additional cost per ship, but since the additional cost isn't provided, it's impossible to calculate.\n\nTherefore, I will provide the monthly fuel savings and note that the payback period cannot be calculated without additional information regarding the cost difference between the old and new ships.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Monthly fuel savings: } \\$270,000 \\text{; Payback period cannot be calculated without additional investment information.}}"
