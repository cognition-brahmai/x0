        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. There's a group of people, and they're divided based on whether they wear glasses or not, and also based on their hair color. Specifically, 60% wear glasses, and 40% don't. Then, among those who wear glasses, 70% have brown hair, and among those who don't wear glasses, 30% have brown hair. I need to find out what percentage of the entire group has brown hair.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand how these percentages relate to each other. It seems like a problem involving conditional probabilities or perhaps just straightforward percentage calculations. Let me try to break it down.\n\nSo, the group is divided into two main parts: those who wear glasses and those who don't. 60% wear glasses, and 40% don't. That's clear.\n\nNow, among those who wear glasses, 70% have brown hair. So, if I consider only the people who wear glasses, 70% of them have brown hair. Similarly, among those who don't wear glasses, 30% have brown hair.\n\nI need to find the total percentage of the group that has brown hair, regardless of whether they wear glasses or not.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can think of this in terms of fractions of the total group.\n\nLet's denote the total group as 100%. That way, percentages directly translate to numbers of people, which might make it easier.\n\nSo, 60% wear glasses, and 40% don't.\n\nNow, among the 60% who wear glasses, 70% have brown hair. So, the percentage of the entire group that wears glasses and has brown hair is 60% times 70%.\n\nWait, is that right? Actually, no. Because 70% is of the 60% who wear glasses. So, it's 70% of 60%.\n\nSimilarly, among those who don't wear glasses, which is 40%, 30% have brown hair. So, that's 30% of 40%.\n\nThen, the total percentage of the group with brown hair would be the sum of these two: 70% of 60% plus 30% of 40%.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 70% of 60% is (70/100) * 60 = 0.7 * 60 = 42%.\n\nSecond, 30% of 40% is (30/100) * 40 = 0.3 * 40 = 12%.\n\nNow, adding these together, 42% + 12% = 54%.\n\nSo, 54% of the entire group has brown hair.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 60% wearing glasses, and 70% of them have brown hair: 0.7 * 60% = 42%.\n\nThen, 40% not wearing glasses, and 30% of them have brown hair: 0.3 * 40% = 12%.\n\nTotal brown hair: 42% + 12% = 54%.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of probabilities. The probability that someone has brown hair is equal to the probability that they wear glasses and have brown hair plus the probability that they don't wear glasses and have brown hair.\n\nSo, P(brown hair) = P(brown hair | wears glasses) * P(wears glasses) + P(brown hair | doesn't wear glasses) * P doesn't wear glasses)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(brown hair) = (0.7 * 0.6) + (0.3 * 0.4) = 0.42 + 0.12 = 0.54, or 54%.\n\nSame answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nSuppose I assume there are 100 people in the group. That might make it easier to visualize.\n\nSo, 60 people wear glasses, and 40 do not.\n\nAmong the 60 who wear glasses, 70% have brown hair: 0.7 * 60 = 42 people.\n\nAmong the 40 who don't wear glasses, 30% have brown hair: 0.3 * 40 = 12 people.\n\nTotal number of people with brown hair: 42 + 12 = 54.\n\nTherefore, 54% of the group has brown hair.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe I can think about the percentages differently.\n\nSuppose I try to find the percentage of people who don't have brown hair and then subtract that from 100% to get the percentage that does.\n\nFirst, find the percentage of people who don't have brown hair.\n\nAmong those who wear glasses, 30% don't have brown hair (since 70% do), so 30% of 60% is 0.3 * 60% = 18%.\n\nAmong those who don't wear glasses, 70% don't have brown hair (since 30% do), so 0.7 * 40% = 28%.\n\nTotal percentage without brown hair: 18% + 28% = 46%.\n\nTherefore, percentage with brown hair is 100% - 46% = 54%.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The answer is 54%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54\\%} \\]"
