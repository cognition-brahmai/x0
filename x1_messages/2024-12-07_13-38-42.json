Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). It affects a person's mood, energy levels, and ability to think clearly. Having bipolar disorder does not mean a person has multiple personalities; that is a different condition called dissociative identity disorder (DID)."
