        "content": "Let's see, you've got this outdoor space filled with plants and flowers, and it's an anagram of \"danger.\" So, an anagram means that it's made by rearranging the letters of \"danger.\" Let's try to rearrange those letters to form the name of such a space.\n\n\"Danger\" has six letters: D, A, N, G, E, R.\n\nI need to think of a word that refers to an outdoor space with plants and flowers.\n\nWell, one common outdoor space with plants is a \"garden.\" Let's check if \"garden\" can be formed from the letters in \"danger.\"\n\nG-A-R-D-E-N.\n\nLooking at \"danger\": D-A-N-G-E-R.\n\nYes, all the letters in \"garden\" are present in \"danger.\"\n\nD: present\n\nA: present\n\nR: present\n\nD: present\n\nE: present\n\nN: present\n\nSo, \"garden\" is indeed an anagram of \"danger.\"\n\nBut wait, an anagram typically means that it uses all the letters exactly once, but in a different order. However, \"garden\" uses all the letters of \"danger\" except for the extra \"R\" in \"danger.\"\n\nWait a minute, \"danger\" has two R's, but \"garden\" only has one R. Let's check again.\n\nActually, \"danger\" has only one D, one A, one N, one G, one E, and one R. No duplicates.\n\nAnd \"garden\" also has one G, one A, one R, one D, one E, and one N.\n\nSo, yes, \"garden\" is an anagram of \"danger,\" using all the letters exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the outdoor space with plants and flowers that is an anagram of \"danger\" is a \"garden.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{garden}} \\]"
