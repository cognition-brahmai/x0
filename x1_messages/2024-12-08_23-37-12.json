        "content": "So I've got this problem about a rectangular garden. It says that the length is 4 meters more than its width, and the perimeter is 48 meters. I need to find the dimensions, which means I need to find both the length and the width of the garden.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the perimeter of a rectangle is. The perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle, which is the sum of all its sides. For a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so the formula for the perimeter is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nNow, the problem gives me that the perimeter P is 48 meters, and that the length L is 4 meters more than the width W. So, I can express the length in terms of the width: L = W + 4.\n\nI can substitute this expression for L into the perimeter formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\n48 = 2(W + 4) + 2W\n\nNow, I'll simplify and solve for W:\n\n48 = 2W + 8 + 2W\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n48 = 4W + 8\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n40 = 4W\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nW = 10 meters\n\nNow that I have the width, I can find the length using the expression L = W + 4:\n\nL = 10 + 4 = 14 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 14 meters in length and 10 meters in width.\n\nTo check if this is correct, I can plug these values back into the perimeter formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W = 2(14) + 2(10) = 28 + 20 = 48 meters, which matches the given perimeter.\n\nLooks good to me!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the garden are \\boxed{14 \\text{ meters by } 10 \\text{ meters}}."
