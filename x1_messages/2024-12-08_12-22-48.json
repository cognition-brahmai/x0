        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 200 units of a product every hour. That's their current production rate. Now, because there's more demand for their product, they plan to increase production by 15% each week. We need to find out how many units they will produce in total over the next three weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 15% increase per week means. Does it mean that each week their hourly production rate goes up by 15%, or is it something else? I think it's the former, that their production rate increases by 15% at the start of each week.\n\nSo, let's break it down week by week.\n\n**Week 1:**\n\n- Hourly production: 200 units\n\n- Assuming they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the total hours in a week would be 24 * 7 = 168 hours.\n\n- Therefore, units produced in Week 1: 200 units/hour * 168 hours = 33,600 units.\n\n**Week 2:**\n\n- Production increases by 15% from Week 1.\n\n- New hourly production: 200 units + (15% of 200) = 200 + 30 = 230 units/hour.\n\n- Total units in Week 2: 230 units/hour * 168 hours = 38,640 units.\n\n**Week 3:**\n\n- Another 15% increase from Week 2.\n\n- New hourly production: 230 units + (15% of 230) = 230 + 34.5 = 264.5 units/hour.\n\n- Since it's unlikely to produce half a unit, maybe we should consider 264 units or round it to 265. But for now, let's keep it as 264.5.\n\n- Total units in Week 3: 264.5 units/hour * 168 hours = 44,364 units.\n\nNow, to find the total production over the three weeks, we add up the units from each week:\n\nTotal units = Week 1 + Week 2 + Week 3 = 33,600 + 38,640 + 44,364 = 116,604 units.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the formula for compound interest since it's a percentage increase each week.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\n\\[A = P (1 + r)^n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(A\\) is the amount after n periods\n\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount (initial amount)\n\n- \\(r\\) is the rate of increase per period\n\n- \\(n\\) is the number of periods\n\nIn this case, the initial production rate is 200 units/hour, the rate of increase is 15% per week, and the number of weeks is 3.\n\nBut, since production happens every hour, and there are 168 hours in a week, perhaps I should calculate the total production per week using the compound interest formula and then sum them up.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n**Week 1 production:**\n\n- Production rate: 200 units/hour\n\n- Total hours: 168\n\n- Total units: 200 * 168 = 33,600 units\n\n**Week 2 production:**\n\n- New production rate: 200 * 1.15 = 230 units/hour\n\n- Total units: 230 * 168 = 38,640 units\n\n**Week 3 production:**\n\n- New production rate: 230 * 1.15 = 264.5 units/hour\n\n- Total units: 264.5 * 168 = 44,364 units\n\n- Total over three weeks: 33,600 + 38,640 + 44,364 = 116,604 units\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the compound interest formula for the production rate and then multiplying by the total hours:\n\nTotal production = P * (1 + r)^0 * h + P * (1 + r)^1 * h + P * (1 + r)^2 * h\n\nWhere:\n\n- P = initial production rate (200 units/hour)\n\n- r = weekly increase rate (0.15)\n\n- h = hours per week (168)\n\n- n = number of weeks (3)\n\nSo,\n\nTotal production = 200 * (1 + 0.15)^0 * 168 + 200 * (1 + 0.15)^1 * 168 + 200 * (1 + 0.15)^2 * 168\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- First term: 200 * 1 * 168 = 33,600\n\n- Second term: 200 * 1.15 * 168 = 38,640\n\n- Third term: 200 * 1.3225 * 168 = 44,364\n\n- Total: 33,600 + 38,640 + 44,364 = 116,604 units\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think this is correct, but to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we might have missed. For example, does the increase happen at the beginning or end of the week? The problem says \"increase production by 15% each week,\" but it doesn't specify when during the week the increase occurs. For simplicity, I assumed the increase happens at the start of each week, which is a common assumption in such problems.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory operates continuously without any downtime. The problem states that they produce 200 units per hour every hour, so I assumed they operate 24/7. If there were any holidays or downtime, we'd need to adjust the total hours accordingly, but since it's not mentioned, I'll stick with 168 hours per week.\n\nAlso, in Week 3, I got 264.5 units per hour. If partial units aren't possible, we might need to round this to 264 or 265 units. But since the problem doesn't specify, and 0.5 unit is likely acceptable as it might refer to a partial unit or an averaging over time, I'll leave it as is.\n\nTherefore, the total production after three weeks is 116,604 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{116604} \\]"
