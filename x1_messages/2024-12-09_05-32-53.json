        "content": "In music theory, the term \"harmonic progression\" refers to the sequence of chords in a piece of music. So, the correct answer is B. The sequence of chords in a piece of music.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, harmonic progression is a fundamental aspect of Western music and plays a crucial role in establishing the mood, structure, and movement within a composition. It involves the systematic use of chords, which are groups of pitches played simultaneously, to create a sense of tension and resolution.\n\nEach chord in a harmonic progression is typically built upon a scale degree of the key in which the music is written. For example, in the key of C major, the chords are constructed from the notes of the C major scale. The most common chords are the tonic (I or C in C major), the dominant (V or G in C major), and the subdominant (IV or F in C major).\n\nHarmonic progressions can be simple, such as the I-IV-V-I progression, which is very common in popular music, or they can be complex, involving multiple chords and extended chord types. The way these chords are ordered and the relationships between them contribute significantly to the harmonic language of the music.\n\nMoreover, harmonic progression is not just about the chords themselves but also about how they are voiced, meaning the specific arrangement of the notes within the chord, and how they are arranged over time, including their duration and the rhythm in which they are played.\n\nUnderstanding harmonic progression is essential for composers, arrangers, and musicians as it provides the framework for creating coherent and pleasing musical structures. It also plays a key role in music analysis, where scholars and students study how composers use harmony to achieve various effects and express different emotions.\n\nIn summary, harmonic progression is the backbone of Western tonal music, providing the harmonic foundation upon which melodies and rhythms are built. It's a vital concept to grasp for anyone seeking to deepen their understanding of music theory and practice."
