        "content": "Sure! A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself. For example, 16 is a perfect square because it's 4 times 4, but 14 isn't a perfect square because there's no integer multiplied by itself that equals 14.\n\nTo check if a number is a perfect square in Python, we can use the math module, which contains a function called sqrt that computes the square root of a number. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square.\n\nHere's how you can write the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = math.sqrt(n)\n    return sqrt_n.is_integer()\n```\n\nLet's break down what this function does:\n\n1. **Import the math module**: This module provides mathematical functions, including sqrt for square roots.\n\n2. **Define the function is_perfect_square(n)**: This function takes one argument, n, which is the number we want to check.\n\n3. **Check if n is negative**: Negative numbers can't be perfect squares because the square of a real number is always non-negative. So, if n is less than 0, the function immediately returns False.\n\n4. **Compute the square root of n**: Using math.sqrt(n), we find the square root of n and store it in sqrt_n.\n\n5. **Check if the square root is an integer**: The is_integer() method checks if the float value is an integer. If sqrt_n.is_integer() returns True, it means that n is a perfect square.\n\nYou can test this function with various numbers to see if they are perfect squares. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(is_perfect_square(16))  # True\nprint(is_perfect_square(14))  # False\nprint(is_perfect_square(25))  # True\nprint(is_perfect_square(-4))  # False\n```\n\nThis should cover the basics of checking for perfect squares in Python.
