        "content": "So there are 12 boys and 16 girls in the classroom, making a total of 12 + 16 = 28 students. Each student has to shake hands with every other student exactly once. I need to find out how many handshakes will take place in total.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem about combinations. You know, like how many ways can you choose two students out of 28 to shake hands. Because shaking hands is a pairwise event, meaning it involves two students at a time.\n\nSo, the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 28 students, and k is 2 because handshakes are between two people.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes should be C(28, 2). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 28! is a big number, but since we have (28 - 2)! in the denominator, which is 26!, those factorials will cancel out to a large extent.\n\nSo, C(28, 2) = 28! / (2!(28 - 2)!) = (28!)/(2! * 26!)).\n\nNow, 28! is 28 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 26!, so the 26! cancels out.\n\nSo, it simplifies to (28 \u00d7 27) / (2 \u00d7 1) = (756) / 2 = 378.\n\nTherefore, there should be 378 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once. So, for the first student, they shake hands with 27 other students. The next student has already shaken hands with the first student, so they shake hands with 26 remaining students. The third student shakes hands with 25 remaining students, and so on, until the last student, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be 27 + 26 + 25 + ... + 1.\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term a_1 is 27, the last term a_n is 1, and the number of terms is 27.\n\nThe sum S of an arithmetic series is given by S = n/2 \u00d7 (a_1 + a_n).\n\nSo, S = 27/2 \u00d7 (27 + 1) = (27/2) \u00d7 28 = (27 \u00d7 28)/2.\n\nLet's calculate that: 27 \u00d7 28 = 756, and 756 / 2 = 378.\n\nAgain, I get 378 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the number of boys and girls.\n\nThere are handshakes between boys, between girls, and between boys and girls.\n\nLet me calculate each of these separately and see if their sum equals 378.\n\nFirst, handshakes between boys: there are 12 boys, so the number of handshakes among boys is C(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11)/2 = 66.\n\nNext, handshakes between girls: there are 16 girls, so C(16, 2) = (16 \u00d7 15)/2 = 120.\n\nThen, handshakes between boys and girls: each boy shakes hands with each girl exactly once, so that's 12 boys \u00d7 16 girls = 192 handshakes.\n\nNow, total handshakes = handshakes among boys + handshakes among girls + handshakes between boys and girls = 66 + 120 + 192.\n\nLet's add those up: 66 + 120 = 186, and 186 + 192 = 378.\n\nAgain, I get 378 handshakes.\n\nSo, all three methods give me the same answer, which gives me confidence that 378 is the correct total number of handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 378 handshakes will take place.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{378} \\]"
