        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Java-based simulation of Conway's Game of Life. This is a classic cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The \"game\" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from humans. The rules are simple, but the patterns can evolve in fascinating ways.\n\n### Understanding Conway's Game of Life\n\nBefore we dive into coding, let's understand the rules of the Game of Life:\n\n1. **Underpopulation:** If a live cell has fewer than two live neighbors, it dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. **Survival:** If a live cell has two or three live neighbors, it lives on to the next generation.\n3. **Overpopulation:** If a live cell has more than three live neighbors, it dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. **Reproduction:** If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n### Designing the Program\n\nWe need to create a program that:\n\n- Allows the user to define the initial state by specifying live cells' coordinates.\n- Runs for a specified number of generations.\n- Displays the grid after each generation.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Grid Representation:** Use a 2D array to represent the grid.\n2. **User Input:** Take input for the grid size, initial live cells, and the number of generations.\n3. **Simulation Logic:** Implement the rules to evolve the grid over generations.\n4. **Display:** Print the grid after each generation.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class GameOfLife {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Get grid dimensions\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the number of rows: \");\n        int rows = scanner.nextInt();\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the number of columns: \");\n        int cols = scanner.nextInt();\n\n        // Initialize the grid\n        int[][] grid = new int[rows][cols];\n\n        // Get initial live cells\n        System.out.println(\"Enter live cells (row col), type 'done' when finished.\");\n        while (true) {\n            String input = scanner.next();\n            if (input.equals(\"done\")) break;\n            int row = scanner.nextInt();\n            int col = scanner.nextInt();\n            if (row >= 0 && row < rows && col >= 0 && col < cols) {\n                grid[row][col] = 1;\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid coordinates. Please try again.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Get number of generations\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the number of generations: \");\n        int generations = scanner.nextInt();\n\n        // Run the simulation\n        for (int gen = 0; gen < generations; gen++) {\n            printGrid(grid, rows, cols);\n            grid = nextGeneration(grid, rows, cols);\n        }\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n\n    private static int[][] nextGeneration(int[][] grid, int rows, int cols) {\n        int[][] newGrid = new int[rows][cols];\n        for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {\n            for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {\n                int liveNeighbors = countLiveNeighbors(grid, row, col, rows, cols);\n                if (grid[row][col] == 1) {\n                    if (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3) {\n                        newGrid[row][col] = 0; // Underpopulation or overpopulation\n                    } else {\n                        newGrid[row][col] = 1; // Survival\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    if (liveNeighbors == 3) {\n                        newGrid[row][col] = 1; // Reproduction\n                    } else {\n                        newGrid[row][col] = 0; // Stay dead\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return newGrid;\n    }\n\n    private static int countLiveNeighbors(int[][] grid, int row, int col, int rows, int cols) {\n        int count = 0;\n        for (int i = -1; i <= 1; i++) {\n            for (int j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {\n                if (i == 0 && j == 0) continue; // Skip the cell itself\n                int r = row + i;\n                int c = col + j;\n                if (r >= 0 && r < rows && c >= 0 && c < cols && grid[r][c] == 1) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    private static void printGrid(int[][] grid, int rows, int cols) {\n        for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {\n            for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {\n                System.out.print(grid[row][col] + \" \");\n            }\n            System.out.println();\n        }\n        System.out.println();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Grid Initialization:** The grid is represented as a 2D array of integers where `1` denotes a live cell and `0` denotes a dead cell.\n2. **User Input:** The user specifies the grid size, initial live cells, and the number of generations.\n3. **Simulation Logic:** The `nextGeneration` function computes the next state of the grid based on the current state and the rules of the Game of Life.\n4. **Display:** The `printGrid` function prints the current state of the grid after each generation.\n\nThis program provides a straightforward implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Java, allowing users to explore the fascinating patterns that emerge from simple rules."
