        "content": "So there are 50 people on the bus initially. At the first stop, 15 people get off, so we subtract 15 from 50, which gives us 35 people remaining on the bus. Then, 10 new passengers get on, so we add 10 to 35, making it 45 people.\n\nNow, at the second stop, 20 people get off. So, we subtract 20 from 45, which leaves us with 25 people on the bus. After that, 25 new passengers get on, so we add 25 to 25, resulting in 50 people on the bus.\n\nWait a minute, that brings us back to 50 people. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 50 people.\n\nFirst stop: -15 get off, +10 get on.\n\n50 - 15 = 35\n\n35 + 10 = 45\n\nSecond stop: -20 get off, +25 get on.\n\n45 - 20 = 25\n\n25 + 25 = 50\n\nYes, the final number of passengers on the bus is 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
