        "content": "So the online retailer wants to expand their warehouse capacity because their customer demand is growing. They currently have 10 warehouses, and each one can store 20,000 items. They plan to build 5 more warehouses, and these new ones will each have double the storage capacity of the existing ones. I need to calculate the total storage capacity once all the new warehouses are built and also estimate the percentage increase in storage capacity compared to what they have now.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the current total storage capacity. They have 10 warehouses, each storing 20,000 items. So, the total current capacity is:\n\n10 warehouses * 20,000 items/warehouse = 200,000 items\n\nNext, they're planning to build 5 new warehouses, each with double the capacity of the existing ones. So, the capacity of each new warehouse is:\n\n2 * 20,000 items = 40,000 items\n\nTherefore, the total capacity of the new warehouses is:\n\n5 warehouses * 40,000 items/warehouse = 200,000 items\n\nNow, to find the total storage capacity once all new warehouses are built, I need to add the current capacity and the new capacity:\n\n200,000 items (current) + 200,000 items (new) = 400,000 items\n\nSo, the total storage capacity will be 400,000 items.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the percentage increase in storage capacity compared to the current situation. To find the percentage increase, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage increase = (increase / original amount) * 100%\n\nThe increase in capacity is the new capacity minus the original capacity, which is:\n\n200,000 items (new capacity) - 200,000 items (original capacity) = 200,000 items\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, the new capacity is 400,000 items, and the original is 200,000 items, so the increase is:\n\n400,000 items - 200,000 items = 200,000 items\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\nPercentage increase = (200,000 / 200,000) * 100% = 1 * 100% = 100%\n\nSo, the storage capacity will increase by 100%.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, current capacity:\n\n10 warehouses * 20,000 items = 200,000 items \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNew warehouses capacity:\n\n5 warehouses * 40,000 items = 200,000 items \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal new capacity:\n\n200,000 items + 200,000 items = 400,000 items \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPercentage increase:\n\n(200,000 / 200,000) * 100% = 100% \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems correct. So, the total storage capacity once the new warehouses are built will be 400,000 items, which is a 100% increase from the current capacity.\n\nI think that's clear, but maybe I can explain it differently or provide another perspective.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that by building 5 new warehouses, each with double the capacity of the existing ones, they're essentially adding the same amount of capacity as they already have. That's because each new warehouse can store 40,000 items, and they're building 5 of them, totaling 200,000 items, which matches their current total capacity of 200,000 items. Therefore, the total capacity doubles, which is a 100% increase.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio of new to existing capacity. Each new warehouse is twice as large as an existing one, and they're building half as many new warehouses as they have existing ones (5 new vs. 10 existing). So, 5 new warehouses * 2 = 10 existing warehouses in terms of capacity. Adding that to the existing 10 warehouses would give a total of 20 warehouses' worth of capacity, which is double the original, again leading to a 100% increase.\n\nI think these different ways of looking at it confirm that the calculation is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor that might affect the total capacity. For example, are there any limitations on how much can be stored in the warehouses, such as space constraints or logistical issues? But based on the information provided, it seems that the only relevant factors are the number of warehouses and their individual capacities.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the new warehouses are all built and operational at the same time. If there's a phased implementation, the total capacity would increase gradually. However, since the question says \"once all new warehouses are built,\" I can assume that they're all operational at the same time.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the existing warehouses might be expanded or modified in any way, but again, the question doesn't mention any changes to the existing warehouses beyond their current capacity.\n\nSo, sticking to the given information, the total storage capacity will be 400,000 items, which is a 100% increase from the current 200,000 items.\n\nI think that's a clear and accurate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400,000 \\text{ items, which is a } 100\\% \\text{ increase}} \\]"
