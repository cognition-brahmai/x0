        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 houses on one side of the street and 30 houses on the other side. So, the total number of houses is 20 plus 30, which is 50 houses. Now, every house has a red door except for two houses that have blue doors. So, if there are two blue doors, then the rest must be red doors. So, total red doors would be total houses minus the blue doors, which is 50 minus 2, equaling 48 red doors. I think that's it. But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Let me double-check. Are there any other factors to consider? The problem seems straightforward. It says every house has a red door except for two that have blue doors. So, yes, 50 houses minus 2 blue doors equals 48 red doors. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
