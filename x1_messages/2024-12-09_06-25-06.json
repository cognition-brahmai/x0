        "content": "I'm not sure which author you're referring to. There were many talented writers during the 19th century who contributed to the genres of horror and suspense, as well as to literary criticism and editing. Some notable figures include Edgar Allan Poe, who is famous for his macabre stories and poems, and also worked as an editor and critic. Another prominent figure is Sheridan Le Fanu, known for his Gothic novels and supernatural tales, who also had a career in journalism and editing. Additionally, there's Wilkie Collins, a pioneer of the suspense novel, who collaborated with Charles Dickens and contributed to various literary publications. These authors not only created enduring works of fiction but also played significant roles in shaping literary culture through their critical and editorial work."
