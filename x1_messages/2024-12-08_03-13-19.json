        "content": "So I've got this problem here: find the sum of the infinite geometric series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... and it goes on forever. Hmm, I remember that geometric series have a first term and a common ratio, and there's a formula for summing them up if they converge. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the first term of the series. Looking at the series, the first term is 1/2. That seems straightforward. Next, I need to find the common ratio between the terms. To find the common ratio, I can divide the second term by the first term: (1/4) divided by (1/2). That's the same as (1/4) multiplied by (2/1), which is 1/2. So, the common ratio is 1/2.\n\nNow, I recall that for an infinite geometric series to converge, the absolute value of the common ratio must be less than 1. In this case, the common ratio is 1/2, and its absolute value is still 1/2, which is less than 1, so the series converges. That's good because if it didn't converge, the sum would be infinite or undefined.\n\nThe formula for the sum S of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Plugging in the values I have, S = (1/2) / (1 - 1/2). Let me calculate the denominator first: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. So, S = (1/2) / (1/2).\n\nDividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so (1/2) divided by (1/2) is the same as (1/2) multiplied by (2/1), which equals 1. Therefore, the sum of the series is 1.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me see if there's another way to look at this. If I add up more and more terms of the series, do they approach 1?\n\nLet's look at the partial sums:\n\n- First term: 1/2\n\n- First two terms: 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4\n\n- First three terms: 3/4 + 1/8 = 7/8\n\n- First four terms: 7/8 + 1/16 = 15/16\n\n- And so on.\n\nI notice a pattern here. Each partial sum is getting closer and closer to 1, but never quite reaching it. For example, 15/16 is 0.9375, which is very close to 1. If I continue adding more terms, the sum will get even closer.\n\nSo, it seems reasonable that as I add infinitely many terms, the sum approaches 1. Therefore, the sum of the infinite series is indeed 1.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the concept of limits. The sum of an infinite series is defined as the limit of the partial sums as the number of terms approaches infinity. In this case, the partial sums are approaching 1, so the limit is 1.\n\nMoreover, this series is a classic example of a geometric series with a common ratio of 1/2, and it's often used to illustrate the concept of infinite series and their sums.\n\nTo double-check, I can consider the formula again. S = a / (1 - r) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/2) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1. Yep, that holds up.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The sum of the infinite geometric series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
