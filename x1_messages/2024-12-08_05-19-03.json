One time, in my second year at Hogwarts, there was this giant spider in the girl's bathroom. Can you imagine? It was massive, and it was guarding some sort of diary. Turns out, it was all part of Voldemort's plan or something. But at the time, all I could think was, \"Bloody hell, a giant spider!\" I'm telling you, even thinking about it makes my skin crawl. I'd rather face a bunch of ferrets any day than deal with those eight-legged nightmares."
