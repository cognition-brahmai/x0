        "content": "Sure! Here's a Python function that counts the occurrence of each character in a string:\n\n```python\ndef count_characters(string):\n    count = {}\n    for char in string:\n        if char in count:\n            count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            count[char] = 1\n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\nstring = \"hello world\"\nresult = count_characters(string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis function initializes an empty dictionary called `count` to store the character counts. It then iterates over each character in the input string. For each character, it checks if it already exists as a key in the `count` dictionary. If it does, it increments the corresponding value by 1. If it doesn't, it adds the character as a new key with an initial count of 1. Finally, it returns the `count` dictionary containing the counts of each character in the string.\n\nIn the example usage, the string \"hello world\" is passed to the `count_characters` function, and the resulting dictionary is printed, which would output something like `{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, ' ': 1, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}`.\n"
