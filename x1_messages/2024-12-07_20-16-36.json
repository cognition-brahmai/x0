He was a Stoor Hobbit who became corrupted by the power of the ring, leading to his transformation into the slimy, miserable creature that we know as Gollum. His obsession with the ring drove him to commit murder and led him on a relentless quest to reclaim it, even after it was taken from him by Bilbo Baggins in \"The Hobbit.\" Gollum's role in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy is pivotal, as his knowledge and pursuit of the ring play a significant part in the events that unfold."
