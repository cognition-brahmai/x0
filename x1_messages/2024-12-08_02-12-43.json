        "content": "Let's see. The factory currently produces 1200 widgets per day. They want to increase that by 15%. So, I need to find out what 15% of 1200 is and then add that to the original amount.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate 15% of 1200. Percentage means per hundred, so 15% is the same as 15/100 or 0.15 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 15% of 1200 is 0.15 multiplied by 1200.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 0.15 \u00d7 1200.\n\n0.15 \u00d7 1200 = 180.\n\nSo, the increase is 180 widgets per day.\n\nNow, to find the total production after the increase, I'll add the increase to the original production.\n\nThat is, 1200 + 180 = 1380.\n\nTherefore, after the increase, the factory will produce 1380 widgets per day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this?\n\nI remember that you can also calculate the total production after a percentage increase by multiplying the original amount by (1 + the percentage increase in decimal form).\n\nSo, in this case, it would be 1200 multiplied by (1 + 0.15), which is 1200 \u00d7 1.15.\n\nLet me check that: 1200 \u00d7 1.15.\n\n1200 \u00d7 1 = 1200.\n\n1200 \u00d7 0.15 = 180.\n\nAdding them up: 1200 + 180 = 1380.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIt's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 100% of production is 1200 widgets, then 15% increase means the new production is 115% of the original.\n\nSo, 115% of 1200 is again 1.15 \u00d7 1200 = 1380.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1380} \\]"
