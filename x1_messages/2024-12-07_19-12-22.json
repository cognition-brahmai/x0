        "content": "The primary function of a transformer in electrical engineering is to change the voltage level of an alternating current. So, the correct answer is B. To change the voltage level of an alternating current.\n\nTransformers are essential components in power distribution systems because they can step up (increase) or step down (decrease) voltage levels efficiently. This is crucial for transmitting electricity over long distances with minimal power loss, as higher voltages allow for lower current flows, which in turn reduce heat losses in transmission lines.\n\nOption A, converting AC to DC, is not the primary function of a transformer; that's typically done by rectifiers or converters. Option C, rectifying a signal, also pertains to converting AC to DC, which again is not the main role of a transformer. Option D, amplifying a signal, is more associated with electronic amplifiers rather than transformers.\n\nSo, in summary, transformers are designed to alter voltage levels in AC circuits through electromagnetic induction between their coils, without changing the frequency of the electric current."
