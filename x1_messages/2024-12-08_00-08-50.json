        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen person from a group of 15 is left-handed. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the composition of the group:\n\n- There are 15 people in total.\n\n- 7 of them have brown eyes.\n\n- The rest have blue eyes. So, the number of people with blue eyes is 15 - 7 = 8.\n\nNext, I look at who is left-handed:\n\n- Among the 7 brown-eyed people, 4 are left-handed.\n\n- Among the 8 blue-eyed people, 3 are left-handed.\n\nI need to find the total number of left-handed people in the group. To do that, I can add the left-handed brown-eyed people and the left-handed blue-eyed people:\n\nTotal left-handed = 4 (brown-eyed left-handed) + 3 (blue-eyed left-handed) = 7.\n\nNow, the probability that a randomly chosen person is left-handed is the total number of left-handed people divided by the total number of people in the group.\n\nSo, Probability = Total left-handed / Total people = 7 / 15.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that. Is there another way to approach this to confirm?\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the probabilities separately for brown-eyed and blue-eyed people and then combine them.\n\nFirst, the probability of selecting a brown-eyed person is 7/15.\n\nThe probability that a brown-eyed person is left-handed is 4/7.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of selecting a blue-eyed person is 8/15.\n\nThe probability that a blue-eyed person is left-handed is 3/8.\n\nSo, the total probability of selecting a left-handed person is:\n\n(P(brown-eyed) * P(left-handed | brown-eyed)) + (P(blue-eyed) * P(left-handed | blue-eyed))\n\nWhich is (7/15 * 4/7) + (8/15 * 3/8).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst part: 7/15 * 4/7 = (7*4)/(15*7) = 28/105 = 4/15.\n\nSecond part: 8/15 * 3/8 = (8*3)/(15*8) = 24/120 = 1/5.\n\nNow, add them together: 4/15 + 1/5.\n\nSince 1/5 is equal to 3/15, then 4/15 + 3/15 = 7/15.\n\nSo, both approaches give me the same answer: 7/15.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there any dependency between eye color and handedness that I'm missing? The problem presents the numbers straightforwardly, so I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of conditional probability, but that seems like overkill for this problem since the direct approach seems sufficient and consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there are any overlapping categories that I need to account for. For example, could someone have both brown and blue eyes? No, the problem states that people have either brown or blue eyes, not both.\n\nAlso, regarding handedness, it's straightforward: left-handed or not left-handed.\n\nSo, I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly chosen person is left-handed is 7/15.\n\nWait, but to be completely sure, let's think about it in terms of the entire group.\n\nTotal people: 15.\n\nTotal left-handed: 4 (brown-eyed left-handed) + 3 (blue-eyed left-handed) = 7.\n\nSo, yes, 7 out of 15 are left-handed.\n\nHence, the probability is indeed 7/15.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{15}} \\]"
