        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 20 students. On Monday, 75% of them wore blue shirts, and on Tuesday, 60% wore blue shirts. Additionally, 40% wore blue shirts on both days. We need to find out how many students didn't wear a blue shirt on either day.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many students wore blue shirts on each day.\n\nOn Monday, 75% of 20 students wore blue shirts. So, that's:\n\n0.75 * 20 = 15 students\n\nOn Tuesday, 60% of 20 students wore blue shirts:\n\n0.60 * 20 = 12 students\n\nNow, 40% wore blue shirts on both days:\n\n0.40 * 20 = 8 students\n\nTo find out how many students wore blue shirts on either Monday or Tuesday or both, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nNumber wearing blue on Monday or Tuesday = (Number on Monday) + (Number on Tuesday) - (Number on both days)\n\nSo, that's:\n\n15 + 12 - 8 = 19 students\n\nThis means 19 students wore blue shirts on at least one of the two days.\n\nNow, to find out how many students did not wear a blue shirt on either day, we subtract this number from the total number of students:\n\n20 - 19 = 1 student\n\nSo, only 1 student didn't wear a blue shirt on either Monday or Tuesday.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nTotal students = 20\n\nBlue on Monday = 15\n\nBlue on Tuesday = 12\n\nBlue on both days = 8\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nBlue on Monday or Tuesday = 15 + 12 - 8 = 19\n\nStudents not wearing blue on either day = 20 - 19 = 1\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think in terms of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nn(M) = number who wore blue on Monday = 15\n\nn(T) = number who wore blue on Tuesday = 12\n\nn(M \u2229 T) = number who wore blue on both days = 8\n\nThen, the number who wore blue on either day is n(M \u222a T) = n(M) + n(T) - n(M \u2229 T) = 15 + 12 - 8 = 19\n\nSo, students not wearing blue on either day = total students - n(M \u222a T) = 20 - 19 = 1\n\nThis matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents students who wore blue on Monday, and the other represents students who wore blue on Tuesday.\n\nThe overlap represents students who wore blue on both days, which is 8 students.\n\nSo, the number who wore blue only on Monday is:\n\nn(M) - n(M \u2229 T) = 15 - 8 = 7 students\n\nThe number who wore blue only on Tuesday is:\n\nn(T) - n(M \u2229 T) = 12 - 8 = 4 students\n\nNow, adding up those who wore blue on at least one day:\n\nOnly Monday: 7\n\nOnly Tuesday: 4\n\nBoth days: 8\n\nTotal: 7 + 4 + 8 = 19\n\nAgain, subtracting from total students: 20 - 19 = 1 student not wearing blue on either day.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the percentages.\n\nBut since we've already calculated it multiple ways and arrived at the same answer, I'm confident that the answer is 1 student.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
