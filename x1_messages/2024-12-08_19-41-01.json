        "content": "So John is renting a car from this company that charges $20 per day plus an extra $0.15 for every mile he drives. He's going to drive it for 100 miles. We need to find out how much he'll have to pay in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the cost structure. There's a fixed daily charge and a variable charge based on the miles driven. Since the question doesn't specify how many days John is renting the car, I'll assume he's renting it for one day. If it's for multiple days, the daily charge would multiply accordingly, but with the information given, one day seems most straightforward.\n\nSo, for one day, the fixed charge is $20.\n\nNext, the variable charge is $0.15 per mile. John drives 100 miles, so I need to calculate 0.15 times 100.\n\nLet me do that: 0.15 \u00d7 100 = $15.\n\nNow, I'll add the fixed charge and the variable charge to get the total cost.\n\nTotal cost = daily charge + mileage charge = $20 + $15 = $35.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there a charge for dropping off the car, or any additional fees? The problem doesn't mention anything else, so I'll stick with the information provided.\n\nSo, John's total cost for renting the car for one day and driving 100 miles would be $35.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nDaily charge: $20.\n\nMileage charge: $0.15 per mile \u00d7 100 miles = $15.\n\nTotal: $20 + $15 = $35.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
