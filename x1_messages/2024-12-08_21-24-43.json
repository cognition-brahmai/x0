        "content": "Let's see. There are six people in the family: four children and presumably two parents. The key information is that each of the four children has exactly one sibling with the same age, meaning they have a twin.\n\nSo, if each child has exactly one sibling with the same age, that suggests that the children are paired into twins. Since there are four children, and each has exactly one twin, that would mean there are two pairs of twins.\n\nWait a minute, let's make sure about this. If there were three pairs of twins, that would be six children, but we're told there are only four children. So, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, if there were only one pair of twins, that would mean two children are twins, and the other two each have no sibling of the same age, but the problem states that each child has exactly one sibling with the same age. So, if there was only one pair of twins, the other two children would not have any siblings with the same age, which contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, the only configuration that satisfies the condition is having two pairs of twins. That way, each of the four children has exactly one sibling with the same age.\n\nSo, the answer should be two pairs of twins.\n\nBut let's think about it another way to confirm. Suppose the four children are A, B, C, and D. If A is a twin of B, and C is a twin of D, then each child has exactly one sibling with the same age. If we tried to have A twin with B, and B twin with C, that would mean A, B, and C are all the same age, which would mean each of them has two siblings with the same age, which contradicts the statement that each child has exactly one sibling with the same age.\n\nTherefore, the only possible arrangement is two distinct pairs of twins.\n\nSo, the family has two pairs of twins among the four children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
