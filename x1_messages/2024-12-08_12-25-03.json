And no man can survive its endless call.\" Hmm, mountains crumbling and temples falling suggests something powerful and unstoppable. And the last part about no man can survive its endless call implies that it's something that affects everyone eventually.\n\nLet me think about what could cause mountains to crumble and temples to fall. Maybe it's time? Time can wear down even the mightiest structures. And the endless call could be referring to the passage of time, which affects everyone without exception.\n\nAlternatively, it could be something like erosion or natural disasters, but I think time makes more sense in this context because it ties in with the idea of an endless call that no one can escape.\n\nSo, my guess is that the answer to this riddle is \"time.\" What do you think?"
