        "content": "Let's see. So there's a train going from Town A to Town B at a constant speed, but it stops halfway for 30 minutes due to a technical issue. The whole journey takes 5 hours, and I need to find out how long the train was actually moving, not including the stop.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the journey in parts. There's the first half of the journey from Town A to the midpoint, then a 30-minute stop, and finally the second half from the midpoint to Town B.\n\nLet me denote the total distance between Town A and Town B as D. So, each half of the journey is D/2.\n\nThe train travels at a constant speed, let's call it S. So, the time to travel each half of the journey would be (D/2)/S = D/(2S).\n\nSince there are two halves, the total travel time without any stops would be 2 * (D/(2S)) = D/S.\n\nBut there is a 30-minute stop in between, so the total journey time is the travel time plus the stop time.\n\nGiven that the entire journey takes 5 hours, I can set up an equation:\n\nTravel time + stop time = total journey time\n\nSo, D/S + 0.5 hours = 5 hours\n\nWait, 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, right? Yeah.\n\nSo, D/S + 0.5 = 5\n\nNow, I can solve for D/S:\n\nD/S = 5 - 0.5 = 4.5 hours\n\nSo, the travel time without stopping is 4.5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nThe train travels half the distance at speed S, stops for 30 minutes, and then travels the other half at the same speed S.\n\nSo, time for first half: D/(2S)\n\nTime for stop: 0.5 hours\n\nTime for second half: D/(2S)\n\nTotal time: D/(2S) + 0.5 + D/(2S) = D/S + 0.5 = 5 hours\n\nYes, so D/S = 4.5 hours\n\nBut the question is asking for how long the train traveled without stopping, which would be the total travel time,\u5373 D/S, which is 4.5 hours.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose the train travels at speed S for time T, and there's a stop of 0.5 hours, and the total time is 5 hours.\n\nSo, T + 0.5 = 5 => T = 4.5 hours\n\nBut T is the total travel time without stopping.\n\nWait, but in the first part, I had D/S = 4.5\n\nBut in this approach, it's the same.\n\nSo, the train traveled for 4.5 hours without stopping.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the stoppage time affects the travel time differently.\n\nSuppose the train travels the first half in T1 hours, stops for 0.5 hours, and then travels the second half in T2 hours, with T1 = T2 since speed is constant and distances are equal.\n\nSo, T1 = T2 = D/(2S)\n\nTotal time: T1 + 0.5 + T2 = 2*(D/(2S)) + 0.5 = D/S + 0.5 = 5 hours\n\nAgain, D/S = 4.5 hours\n\nSo, the train traveled for 4.5 hours in total without stopping.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of average speed or something, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nThe question is straightforward once I break it down into parts.\n\nSo, the answer should be 4.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
