        "content": "Let's see. The factory originally produces 150 widgets per hour. They're increasing production by 25%. So first, I need to find out what 25% of 150 is.\n\n25% of 150 should be calculated as 0.25 multiplied by 150. Let me do that: 0.25 \u00d7 150 = 37.5.\n\nSo, the production is increasing by 37.5 widgets per hour. Now, to find the new production rate, I'll add that increase to the original production:\n\n150 + 37.5 = 187.5 widgets per hour.\n\nWait, but widgets are typically whole items, so producing half a widget doesn't make sense. Maybe I should consider if the problem allows for fractional widgets or if I need to round to the nearest whole number. But for now, I'll proceed with 187.5 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many widgets are produced in 8 hours at this new production rate. So, I'll multiply the new hourly production by 8:\n\n187.5 \u00d7 8.\n\nLet me calculate that. 187.5 times 8:\n\nFirst, 100 \u00d7 8 = 800.\n\n800 plus 80 times 8, which is 640, but wait, that's not right. Maybe I should break it down differently.\n\nAlternatively, 187.5 \u00d7 8:\n\n100 \u00d7 8 = 800\n\n80 \u00d7 8 = 640\n\n7 \u00d7 8 = 56\n\n0.5 \u00d7 8 = 4\n\nNow, add them up: 800 + 640 = 1440, plus 56 is 1496, plus 4 is 1500.\n\nSo, the factory produces 1500 widgets in 8 hours at the increased production rate.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, since the production increased by 25%, the new production rate is 125% of the original rate.\n\n125% of 150 is calculated as 1.25 \u00d7 150.\n\nLet me compute that: 1.25 \u00d7 150.\n\n1 \u00d7 150 = 150\n\n0.25 \u00d7 150 = 37.5\n\nTotal: 150 + 37.5 = 187.5 widgets per hour.\n\nThen, 187.5 \u00d7 8 = 1500.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the factory produces 1500 widgets in 8 hours after increasing production by 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1500} \\]"
