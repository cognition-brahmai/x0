        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students, and 60% of them are boys. I need to find out how many girls are in the class. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many boys there are. Since 60% of the class are boys, I can calculate the number of boys by taking 60% of 30.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 30, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply by the total number of students. So, 60% is the same as 0.60.\n\nSo, number of boys = 0.60 \u00d7 30\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 0.60 \u00d7 30 = 18.\n\nSo, there are 18 boys in the class.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students.\n\nNumber of girls = total students - number of boys\n\nNumber of girls = 30 - 18\n\nNumber of girls = 12\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since 60% are boys, that means the remaining percentage are girls. So, 100% - 60% = 40% are girls.\n\nNow, I can calculate 40% of 30 to find the number of girls.\n\n40% of 30 is 0.40 \u00d7 30\n\n0.40 \u00d7 30 = 12\n\nSo, again, I get 12 girls in the class.\n\nHmm, that matches my previous calculation. So, I think 12 is the correct number of girls in the class.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I use the ratio of boys to girls. If 60% are boys, then the ratio of boys to the total is 60:100, which simplifies to 3:5.\n\nWait, but that might not directly help me find the number of girls.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of fractions. 60% is equivalent to 3/5, so 3/5 of the class are boys.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys is 3/5 \u00d7 30 = 18, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the number of girls would be 2/5 \u00d7 30 = 12, since 2/5 are girls (because 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).\n\nAgain, I get 12 girls.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation.\n\nLet G be the number of girls.\n\nThen, G + number of boys = total students\n\nWe know the number of boys is 18, and total students are 30.\n\nSo, G + 18 = 30\n\nTherefore, G = 30 - 18 = 12\n\nOnce again, 12 girls.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now. So, the class has 12 girls.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the percentages add up correctly.\n\nNumber of boys: 18, which is 18/30 = 0.60, or 60%\n\nNumber of girls: 12, which is 12/30 = 0.40, or 40%\n\nYes, that adds up to 100%.\n\nAlso, just to check if the class size is correct.\n\n18 boys + 12 girls = 30 students.\n\nYes, that matches the given total.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is definitely 12 girls in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
