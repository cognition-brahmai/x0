        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that counts how often each word appears in a piece of text and also shows the top 5 words that appear the most. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases.\n\nFirst, I need to accept a string of text from the user. Python makes that easy with the `input()` function. So, I'll prompt the user to enter some text.\n\nNext, I have to split that text into words. Words are usually separated by spaces, so I can use the `split()` method on the string. But I need to consider punctuation. For example, if there's a word followed by a comma or a period, I want to treat the word and the punctuation as separate tokens. Maybe I should remove punctuation before splitting.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to strip punctuation from the words so that \"word,\" and \"word\" are counted as the same word without the comma. Python has the `string` module which has a `punctuation` variable that contains all punctuation characters. I can use that to remove punctuation from the text before splitting it into words.\n\nAlso, I should handle case sensitivity. If the text has some words capitalized and some not, I want to count them as the same word. So, I'll convert the entire text to lowercase before processing.\n\nOnce I have a list of words, I need to count the frequency of each word. Python's `collections` module has a `Counter` class that's perfect for this task. It can take a list and return a dictionary where keys are the elements from the list and values are their counts.\n\nAfter that, I need to display the frequency of each word. I can iterate over the dictionary and print each word along with its count.\n\nAdditionally, I need to implement a method to display the top 5 most frequent words. Since I'm using `Counter`, it has a method called `most_common()` that can return the most common elements and their counts. I can call `most_common(5)` to get the top 5 words.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the script. I'll probably write a function that takes the text as input, processes it as described, and returns the frequency dictionary. Then, I can have another function to display the top 5 words.\n\nI should also handle cases where there are fewer than 5 unique words or where multiple words have the same frequency.\n\nWait, what if there are ties in frequency for the 5th position? I need to decide how to handle that. Maybe I'll just take the first 5, even if there are ties.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that the text might contain numbers or a mix of letters and numbers. For now, I'll treat them as words as long as they're separated by spaces.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the steps:\n\n1. Get input text from the user.\n\n2. Remove punctuation from the text.\n\n3. Convert the text to lowercase.\n\n4. Split the text into words.\n\n5. Use `Counter` to count the frequency of each word.\n\n6. Display the frequency of each word.\n\n7. Display the top 5 most frequent words.\n\nI should also think about testing the script with different inputs to make sure it works as expected. For example:\n\n- Text with multiple sentences and punctuation.\n\n- Text with all letters in uppercase.\n\n- Text with mixed case and punctuation.\n\n- Text with numbers and special characters.\n\n- Text with repeated words.\n\n- Text with fewer than 5 unique words.\n\nI need to make sure that the script handles all these cases correctly.\n\nLet me consider how to remove punctuation. I can iterate over each character in the text and check if it's a punctuation character using `string.punctuation`, and remove it.\n\nBut that might not be the most efficient way, especially for large texts. Maybe I can use the `translate()` method of strings along with `str.maketrans()` to remove punctuation.\n\nYes, that sounds better. I can create a translation table that maps each punctuation character to `None`, and then use `translate()` to remove them.\n\nSo, in code, it would look like this:\n\nimport string\n\ntext = \"Your text here.\"\n\ntranslator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n\ntext = text.translate(translator)\n\nThat should remove all punctuation from the text.\n\nNext, splitting the text into words. After removing punctuation and converting to lowercase, I can use `split()` to break the text into words based on spaces.\n\nThen, counting the frequency with `Counter`.\n\nDisplaying the frequency is straightforward: loop through the dictionary and print each word and its count.\n\nFor the top 5, I'll use `most_common(5)` and print those.\n\nI should also handle the case where there are fewer than 5 unique words. For example, if there are only 3 unique words, it should display all of them.\n\nLet me think about edge cases:\n\n- Empty string: No words to count.\n\n- String with only punctuation: Should result in no words.\n\n- String with multiple spaces or newline characters: Should handle them correctly.\n\n- String with words that are the same except for case: Should treat them as the same word.\n\n- String with non-alphabetic characters, like numbers or symbols: Should treat them as words.\n\nI need to decide whether to include numbers in the word count or not. For now, I'll include them, as per the initial requirements.\n\nLet me also consider performance. Since `Counter` is efficient, and the operations are straightforward, I don't expect any performance issues for reasonable-sized texts.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the code. I'll write a function, say `word_frequency()`, that takes the text as input and returns the frequency dictionary.\n\nAnother function, `top_five_words()`, that takes the frequency dictionary and prints the top 5 words.\n\nIn the main part of the script, I'll get user input, process it, and display the results.\n\nI should also make sure that the script is user-friendly, with clear prompts and outputs.\n\nLet me draft a sample output to guide my implementation.\n\nSample Input:\n\n\"Hello, world! Hello everyone. This is a test. Test, test, and more testing.\"\n\nSample Output:\n\nWord frequencies:\n\nhello: 2\n\nworld: 1\n\neveryone: 1\n\nthis: 1\n\nis: 1\n\na: 1\n\ntest: 3\n\nand: 1\n\nmore: 1\n\ntesting: 1\n\nTop 5 words:\n\n1. test: 3\n\n2. hello: 2\n\n3. world: 1\n\n4. everyone: 1\n\n5. this: 1\n\nWait, but in this case, multiple words have the same frequency. I need to decide the order in which to display them when frequencies are the same.\n\n`Counter`'s `most_common()` should return them in order of frequency, and for words with the same frequency, it should maintain the order of their first occurrence in the text.\n\nThat should be acceptable for this task.\n\nLet me also think about international characters. If the text contains non-English characters, like accented letters, I should make sure they're handled correctly.\n\nPython 3 handles Unicode well, so as long as I'm using string operations that are Unicode-aware, I should be fine.\n\nFor now, I'll assume the input is in English, but the script should still work with other languages that use the Latin alphabet.\n\nAnother consideration is stemming or lemmatization, but that's probably overkill for this task. I'll stick to counting exact word forms.\n\nOkay, I think I have a plan. Let's proceed to implement the script step by step.\n\nFirst, import necessary modules:\n\nimport string\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nThen, define the function to calculate word frequencies:\n\ndef word_frequency(text):\n\n# Remove punctuation\n\ntranslator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n\ntext = text.translate(translator)\n\n# Convert to lowercase\n\ntext = text.lower()\n\n# Split into words\n\nwords = text.split()\n\n# Count frequencies\n\nfreq = Counter(words)\n\nreturn freq\n\nNext, define the function to display the top 5 words:\n\ndef top_five_words(freq):\n\n# Get the most common words\n\ntop_words = freq.most_common(5)\n\n# Display them\n\nprint(\"Top 5 words:\")\n\nfor i, (word, count) in enumerate(top_words, start=1):\n\nprint(f\"{i}. {word}: {count}\")\n\nNow, in the main part of the script, get user input and call these functions:\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n# Get user input\n\ntext = input(\"Enter some text: \")\n\n# Calculate frequencies\n\nfreq = word_frequency(text)\n\n# Display frequencies\n\nprint(\"\\nWord frequencies:\")\n\nfor word, count in freq.items():\n\nprint(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\n# Display top 5 words\n\ntop_five_words(freq)\n\nI should also add some checks to handle empty input or input with no words after removing punctuation.\n\nFor example, if the input is just punctuation or empty, I should inform the user that there are no words to count.\n\nLet me modify the main part to handle such cases:\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n# Get user input\n\ntext = input(\"Enter some text: \")\n\n# Calculate frequencies\n\nfreq = word_frequency(text)\n\nif not freq:\n\nprint(\"No words to count.\")\n\nelse:\n\n# Display frequencies\n\nprint(\"\\nWord frequencies:\")\n\nfor word, count in freq.items():\n\nprint(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\n# Display top 5 words\n\ntop_five_words(freq)\n\nThat should cover the case where there are no words to count.\n\nLet me also think about how to handle words that are separated by different types of whitespace, like tabs or newlines. The `split()` method in Python handles these correctly by splitting on any whitespace.\n\nSo, words separated by multiple spaces, tabs, or newlines should still be handled correctly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that some words might have apostrophes, like \"don't\" or \"it's\". Removing all punctuation would separate the apostrophe, resulting in \"dont\" and \"its\", which might not be desirable.\n\nMaybe I should only remove punctuation that is not part of a word, like commas and periods outside of contractions.\n\nTo handle this, I can use regular expressions to remove punctuation while preserving apostrophes within words.\n\nPython's `re` module can be useful here.\n\nI can define a pattern that matches punctuation except apostrophes, and remove those.\n\nLet me see:\n\nimport re\n\npattern = r\"[^\\w\\s']\"\n\ntext = re.sub(pattern, '', text)\n\nThis pattern matches any character that is not a word character (`\\w`), not whitespace (`\\s`), and not an apostrophe (`'`). It replaces those characters with an empty string, effectively removing them.\n\nThis should preserve contractions like \"don't\" and \"it's\" while removing other punctuation.\n\nI'll update the `word_frequency` function to use this approach.\n\nSo, the updated `word_frequency` function would look like this:\n\nimport re\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef word_frequency(text):\n\n# Remove punctuation except apostrophes\n\npattern = r\"[^\\w\\s']\"\n\ntext = re.sub(pattern, '', text)\n\n# Convert to lowercase\n\ntext = text.lower()\n\n# Split into words\n\nwords = text.split()\n\n# Count frequencies\n\nfreq = Counter(words)\n\nreturn freq\n\nThis should handle contractions properly.\n\nLet me test this pattern with a sample text:\n\nSample text: \"Hello, world! Hello everyone. It's a test. Don't worry.\"\n\nAfter removing punctuation except apostrophes: \"Hello world Hello everyone Its a test Dont worry\"\n\nThen, splitting into words and counting frequencies.\n\nThis looks better.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that apostrophes at the beginning or end of words are handled correctly. For example, if there's a word like \"'word\" or \"word'\", where the apostrophe is at the beginning or end.\n\nIn such cases, the apostrophe should be considered part of the word.\n\nWith the current pattern, \" 'word\" would become \"'word\" and \"word'\" would become \"word'\", which is correct.\n\nBut, in the context of the text, leading or trailing apostrophes might not be desirable. Maybe I should consider stripping leading and trailing apostrophes from each word.\n\nI can do that by using the `strip()` method on each word to remove leading and trailing apostrophes.\n\nSo, after splitting the text into words, I can iterate over the list and strip apostrophes from the beginning and end of each word.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\nwords = [word.strip(\"'\") for word in words]\n\nThis should remove any leading or trailing apostrophes from each word.\n\nTherefore, \"'word\" becomes \"word\" and \"word'\" becomes \"word\".\n\nThis seems more consistent.\n\nI'll add that step to the `word_frequency` function.\n\nUpdated `word_frequency` function:\n\nimport re\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef word_frequency(text):\n\n# Remove punctuation except apostrophes\n\npattern = r\"[^\\w\\s']\"\n\ntext = re.sub(pattern, '', text)\n\n# Convert to lowercase\n\ntext = text.lower()\n\n# Split into words\n\nwords = text.split()\n\n# Strip apostrophes from the beginning and end of words\n\nwords = [word.strip(\"'\") for word in words]\n\n# Count frequencies\n\nfreq = Counter(words)\n\nreturn freq\n\nThis should handle words with leading or trailing apostrophes correctly.\n\nNow, let's consider words that contain apostrophes in the middle, like contractions or possessive forms.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"it's\" should be counted as \"its\"\n\n- \"don't\" should be counted as \"dont\"\n\n- \"john's\" should be counted as \"johns\"\n\nWait, but \"it's\" is a contraction for \"it is\", and \"john's\" is possessive.\n\nIn terms of word frequency, should \"it's\" be treated as \"its\" or as \"it is\"?\n\nFor simplicity, I'll treat \"it's\" as a single word \"its\" and \"don't\" as \"dont\", etc.\n\nThis might not be ideal from a linguistic perspective, but for this task, it should suffice.\n\nIf I want to handle contractions more accurately, I would need a more sophisticated approach, like expanding contractions to their full forms.\n\nBut that's beyond the scope of this task.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with treating words containing apostrophes as single words after removing surrounding punctuation.\n\nNow, let's think about hyphenated words. For example, \"well-known\" or \"mother-in-law\".\n\nShould I treat them as single words or split them into separate words?\n\nIn English, hyphenated words are considered as single words, so I should treat them as such.\n\nMy current approach removes all punctuation except apostrophes, so hyphens would remain, keeping hyphenated words intact.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nAnother consideration is words that are separated by newline characters.\n\nPython's `split()` method can handle newline characters as whitespace, so words on different lines should still be treated as separate words.\n\nBut, if there are multiple newline characters or extra spaces, `split()` would introduce empty strings in the list of words.\n\nTo handle this, I can filter out any empty strings from the list of words.\n\nSo, after splitting, I can do:\n\nwords = [word.strip(\"'\") for word in words if word]\n\nThis ensures that only non-empty words are considered.\n\nI'll update the `word_frequency` function accordingly.\n\nUpdated `word_frequency` function:\n\nimport re\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef word_frequency(text):\n\n# Remove punctuation except apostrophes\n\npattern = r\"[^\\w\\s']\"\n\ntext = re.sub(pattern, '', text)\n\n# Convert to lowercase\n\ntext = text.lower()\n\n# Split into words\n\nwords = text.split()\n\n# Strip apostrophes from the beginning and end of words and filter out empty strings\n\nwords = [word.strip(\"'\") for word in words if word]\n\n# Count frequencies\n\nfreq = Counter(words)\n\nreturn freq\n\nThis should handle empty strings resulting from multiple spaces or newline characters.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the text contains numbers.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"Room 101 is on the first floor. The cost is $100.\"\n\nAfter removing punctuation (except apostrophes), converting to lowercase, and splitting, the words would be:\n\n[\"room\", \"101\", \"is\", \"on\", \"the\", \"first\", \"floor\", \"the\", \"cost\", \"is\", \"100\"]\n\nSo, \"101\" and \"100\" would be treated as words.\n\nIn the frequency count, numbers would be included if they appear as words.\n\nIf I want to exclude numbers, I can add an additional step to filter out words that are purely numeric.\n\nBut according to the initial requirements, I need to treat numbers as words, so I'll include them.\n\nNext, I need to implement the `top_five_words` function to display the top 5 most frequent words.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I'll use `most_common(5)` from the `Counter` object.\n\nHowever, I should handle the case where there are fewer than 5 unique words.\n\nIn such cases, `most_common(5)` will return all available word-frequency pairs.\n\nSo, I don't need to do anything special; it will work as is.\n\nLet me write the `top_five_words` function:\n\ndef top_five_words(freq):\n\n# Get the most common words\n\ntop_words = freq.most_common(5)\n\n# Display them\n\nprint(\"\\nTop 5 words:\")\n\nfor i, (word, count) in enumerate(top_words, start=1):\n\nprint(f\"{i}. {word}: {count}\")\n\nThis should handle both cases where there are at least 5 words and fewer than 5 words.\n\nNow, in the main part of the script, I need to get user input and call these functions.\n\nI should also handle the case where the user enters an empty string or only punctuation, resulting in no words to count.\n\nIn such cases, `freq` would be an empty `Counter`, and I should inform the user accordingly.\n\nI'll add a check after calculating the frequency:\n\nif not freq:\n\nprint(\"No words to count.\")\n\nelse:\n\n# Display frequencies\n\nprint(\"\\nWord frequencies:\")\n\nfor word, count in freq.items():\n\nprint(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\n# Display top 5 words\n\ntop_five_words(freq)\n\nThis should cover the edge case of no words.\n\nLet me also think about how to handle very large inputs.\n\nPython's `input()` function reads the entire input at once, which could be a problem for very large texts.\n\nTo handle large inputs, I could read the input line by line and process each line separately, accumulating the word frequencies.\n\nBut for simplicity, and assuming that the text entered by the user won't be excessively large, I'll stick with reading the entire input at once.\n\nIf needed, I can modify it later to handle larger inputs.\n\nNow, to make the script more user-friendly, I can provide clear prompts and format the output neatly.\n\nFor example, when asking for input, I can specify that the user should enter some text.\n\nAlso, I can add a header before displaying the word frequencies and the top 5 words.\n\nLet me update the main part accordingly:\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n# Get user input\n\ntext = input(\"Please enter the text: \")\n\n# Calculate frequencies\n\nfreq = word_frequency(text)\n\nif not freq:\n\nprint(\"No words to count.\")\n\nelse:\n\n# Display frequencies\n\nprint(\"\\nWord Frequencies:\")\n\nfor word, count in freq.items():\n\nprint(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\n# Display top 5 words\n\nprint(\"\\nTop 5 Words:\")\n\ntop_five_words(freq)\n\nI added headers for clarity.\n\nNow, let's consider how to handle words that are the same except for case.\n\nFor example, \"Hello\" and \"hello\" should be counted as the same word.\n\nSince I'm converting the text to lowercase before splitting, they should be treated as the same word.\n\nLet me test this with a sample input:\n\nSample Input: \"Hello Hello hello\"\n\nAfter processing: [\"hello\", \"hello\", \"hello\"]\n\nFrequency: hello: 3\n\nTop 5: hello: 3\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAnother consideration is words that contain apostrophes in the middle, like \"mother-in-law\".\n\nAfter processing, \"mother-in-law\" should be treated as a single word.\n\nLet me test with:\n\nSample Input: \"Mother-in-law's car is brand new.\"\n\nAfter removing punctuation except apostrophes: \"mother-in-law's car is brand new\"\n\nThen, splitting into words: [\"mother-in-law's\", \"car\", \"is\", \"brand\", \"new\"]\n\nThen, stripping apostrophes from the beginning and end: [\"mother-in-law s\", \"car\", \"is\", \"brand\", \"new\"]\n\nWait a minute, \"mother-in-law's\" becomes \"mother-in-law s\" because the apostrophe in the possessive form is not at the end; it's followed by an \"s\". So, stripping apostrophes from the beginning and end would remove any apostrophes that are at the start or end of the word, but not those in the middle.\n\nTherefore, \"mother-in-law's\" becomes \"mother-in-law s\", which is not ideal.\n\nI need to find a better way to handle possessive forms.\n\nOne approach is to remove apostrophes only when they are at the end of the word, assuming they are possessive markers.\n\nSo, I can modify the step where I strip apostrophes to only remove trailing apostrophes.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\nwords = [word.rstrip(\"'\").lstrip(\"'\") for word in words if word]\n\nWait, no. `strip(\"'\")` removes apostrophes from both ends.\n\nIf I use `rstrip(\"'\")`, it removes trailing apostrophes, and `lstrip(\"'\")` removes leading apostrophes.\n\nBut in \"mother-in-law's\", the apostrophe is followed by \"s\", so it's not just a trailing apostrophe.\n\nI need a way to handle possessive \"'s\" by removing the trailing \"'s\" to get the base form of the word.\n\nThis is getting more complex.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"john's\" should be counted as \"john\"\n\n- \"cats'\" should be counted as \"cats\"\n\n- \"ai's\" should be counted as \"ai\"\n\nBut handling all possessive forms correctly would require more advanced natural language processing.\n\nFor this task, I'll keep it simple and treat \"mother-in-law's\" as \"mother-in-law s\", acknowledging that it's not perfect but sufficient for basic word frequency counting.\n\nIf I were to implement a more accurate handling of possessive forms, I would need to identify trailing \"'s\" and remove them, but that's beyond the current scope.\n\nNow, let's think about contractions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"can't\" should be counted as \"can't\"\n\n- \"won't\" should be counted as \"won't\"\n\n- \"I'm\" should be counted as \"I m\"\n\nWait, \"I'm\" would become \"I m\" which is not ideal.\n\nIdeally, I would expand contractions to their full forms, but that's complex.\n\nAlternatively, I can treat contractions as single words, keeping the apostrophe in place.\n\nGiven that, I need to adjust my approach to not strip apostrophes from within words.\n\nSo, perhaps I should only remove leading and trailing apostrophes if they are not part of a contraction.\n\nThis is getting tricky.\n\nTo simplify, I'll treat any sequence of characters separated by spaces as a word, preserving apostrophes within words, but removing leading and trailing apostrophes.\n\nSo, \"I'm\" would be \"I'm\", \"can't\" would be \"can't\", \"john's\" would be \"john's\", and \"'word\" would be \"word\".\n\nThis seems like a reasonable compromise.\n\nTherefore, I'll keep the step where I strip apostrophes from the beginning and end of words.\n\nHere's the `word_frequency` function again:\n\nimport re\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef word_frequency(text):\n\n# Remove punctuation except apostrophes\n\npattern = r\"[^\\w\\s']\"\n\ntext = re.sub(pattern, '', text)\n\n# Convert to lowercase\n\ntext = text.lower()\n\n# Split into words\n\nwords = text.split()\n\n# Strip apostrophes from the beginning and end of words and filter out empty strings\n\nwords = [word.strip(\"'\") for word in words if word]\n\n# Count frequencies\n\nfreq = Counter(words)\n\nreturn freq\n\nThis should handle most cases adequately.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the script can handle different types of input, including those with multiple lines, different types of punctuation, and various casing.\n\nLet me test the script with a sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n\"\"\"\n\nHello, world! Hello everyone.\n\nThis is a test. Test, test, and more testing.\n\nNumbers like 123 should be counted as words.\n\nHandling of contractions: don't, it's, AI's.\n\nAlso, hyphenated-words should be considered as single words.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nExpected Output:\n\nWord frequencies:\n\nhello: 2\n\nworld: 1\n\neveryone: 1\n\nthis: 1\n\nis: 1\n\na: 1\n\ntest: 3\n\nand: 1\n\nmore: 1\n\ntesting: 1\n\nnumbers: 1\n\nlike: 1\n\n123: 1\n\nshould: 1\n\nbe: 1\n\ncounted: 1\n\nas: 1\n\nwords: 1\n\nhandling: 1\n\nof: 1\n\ncontractions: 1\n\ndon't: 1\n\nit's: 1\n\nai's: 1\n\nalso: 1\n\nhyphenated-words: 1\n\nTop 5 words:\n\n1. test: 3\n\n2. hello: 2\n\n3. world: 1\n\n4. everyone: 1\n\n5. this: 1\n\nNote: The top 5 are displayed based on frequency, and since multiple words have frequency 1, it displays the first five.\n\nI need to make sure that the script produces this output or similar.\n\nI should also consider that `Counter.most_common(5)` returns the top 5 words based on frequency, and if there are ties, it maintains the order of first occurrence.\n\nNow, to make the script more robust, I can add comments explaining each step and ensure that the code is clean and readable.\n\nAdditionally, I can handle any potential exceptions, although for this simple script, exceptions are unlikely unless the input is exceptionally large or malformed.\n\nFinally, I need to make sure that the script is run as a standalone program, so I'll use the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard.\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete script:\n\n\"\"\"\n\nScript to count word frequencies in a given text and display the top 5 most frequent words.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport re\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef word_frequency(text):\n\n\"\"\"\n\nCalculates the frequency of each word in the given text.\n\n- Removes punctuation except apostrophes.\n\n- Converts text to lowercase.\n\n- Splits text into words and strips leading/trailing apostrophes.\n\n- Counts the frequency of each word.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Remove punctuation except apostrophes\n\npattern = r\"[^\\w\\s']\"\n\ntext = re.sub(pattern, '', text)\n\n# Convert to lowercase\n\ntext = text.lower()\n\n# Split into words\n\nwords = text.split()\n\n# Strip apostrophes from the beginning and end of words and filter out empty strings\n\nwords = [word.strip(\"'\") for word in words if word]\n\n# Count frequencies\n\nfreq = Counter(words)\n\nreturn freq\n\ndef top_five_words(freq):\n\n\"\"\"\n\nDisplays the top 5 most frequent words from the given frequency dictionary.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Get the most common words\n\ntop_words = freq.most_common(5)\n\n# Display them\n\nprint(\"\\nTop 5 Words:\")\n\nfor i, (word, count) in enumerate(top_words, start=1):\n\nprint(f\"{i}. {word}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n# Get user input\n\ntext = input(\"Please enter the text: \")\n\n# Calculate frequencies\n\nfreq = word_frequency(text)\n\nif not freq:\n\nprint(\"No words to count.\")\n\nelse:\n\n# Display frequencies\n\nprint(\"\\nWord Frequencies:\")\n\nfor word, count in freq.items():\n\nprint(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\n# Display top 5 words\n\ntop_five_words(freq)\n\nThis script should fulfill the requirements and handle various edge cases appropriately.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this task, we need to create a Python script that accepts a string of text, calculates the frequency of each word in the text, and displays the top 5 most frequent words. \n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling:** We accept the input text from the user.\n2. **Text Preprocessing:**\n   -

Removes punctuation except apostrophes.\n    - Converts text to lowercase.\n    - Splits text into words and strips leading/trailing apostrophes.\n    - Counts the frequency of each word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove punctuation except apostrophes\n    pattern = re.compile(r\"[^\\w\\s']\")\n    text = pattern.sub('', text)\n    \n    # Convert to lowercase\n    text = text.lower()\n    \n    # Split into words\n    words = text.split()\n    \n    # Strip apostrophes from the beginning and end of words and filter out empty strings\n    words = [word.strip(\"'\") for word in words if word]\n    \n    # Count frequencies\n    freq = Counter(words)\n    \n    return freq\n\ndef top_five_words(freq):\n    \"\"\"\n    Displays the top 5 most frequent words from the given frequency dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the most common words\n    top_words = freq.most_common(5)\n    \n    # Display them\n    print(\"\\nTop 5 Words:\")\n    for i, (word, count) in enumerate(top_words, start=1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {word}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Get user input\n    text = input(\"Please enter the text: \")\n    \n    # Calculate frequencies\n    freq = word_frequency(text)\n    \n    if not freq:\n        print(\"No words to count.\")\n    else:\n        # Display frequencies\n        print(\"\\nWord Frequencies:\")\n        for word, count in freq.items():\n            print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n        \n        # Display top 5 words\n        top_five_words(freq)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling:** We use `input()` to get the text from the user.\n2. **Text Preprocessing:**\n   - We compile a regex pattern to remove all punctuation except apostrophes.\n   - Convert the text to lowercase to ensure that words are counted without case sensitivity.\n   - Split the text into words and remove any leading or trailing apostrophes from each word.\n3. **Frequency Calculation:** We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each word.\n4. **Output Results:**\n   - We iterate through the frequency dictionary and print each word with its count.\n   - We use `most_common(5)` to get and print the top 5 most frequent words.\n\nThis script is designed to handle various edge cases, such as text with punctuation, mixed case letters, contractions, and numbers, ensuring accurate word frequency counting and reporting."
