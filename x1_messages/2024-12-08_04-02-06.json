        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a triangle with a base of 12 inches and a height of 8 inches, and I need to find its area in square inches. Alright, let's recall the formula for the area of a triangle. I think it's something like area equals base times height divided by two. Yeah, that sounds right. So, area equals (base \u00d7 height) / 2.\n\nLet me write that down: Area = (12 inches \u00d7 8 inches) / 2.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply the base and height: 12 times 8 is 96. So, that's 96 square inches before I divide by 2.\n\nNow, divide that by 2: 96 divided by 2 is 48.\n\nSo, the area should be 48 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the formula. Yes, the area of a triangle is indeed (base \u00d7 height) / 2.\n\nAnd the base is 12 inches, height is 8 inches, so 12 times 8 is 96, and divided by 2 is 48.\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nBut let me think again, maybe there's another way to approach this. Maybe using trigonometry or something, but that seems unnecessary for this straightforward problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could imagine the triangle as half of a parallelogram with the same base and height. The area of the parallelogram would be base times height, which is 96 square inches, and since the triangle is half of that, again, 48 square inches.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nLet me consider units as well. Base is in inches, height is in inches, so their product is in square inches, which is correct for area.\n\nI don't think I missed anything, but to be thorough, I'll consider if the triangle is a right triangle or not. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the type of triangle, but the formula for area as (base \u00d7 height) / 2 applies to all triangles, regardless of their shape, as long as I have the base and the corresponding height.\n\nSo, even if it's not a right triangle, as long as the height is perpendicular to the base, the formula holds.\n\nI think I'm confident with the answer being 48 square inches.\n\nJust for kicks, let's imagine if it were a right triangle with legs of 12 inches and 8 inches. Then the area would be (12 \u00d7 8) / 2 = 48 square inches, same as before.\n\nIf it were an equilateral triangle, the formula would be different, but since it's not specified, I'll stick with the given base and height.\n\nAlternatively, if it were an isosceles triangle, but again, the general formula still applies.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the area of the triangle is 48 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
