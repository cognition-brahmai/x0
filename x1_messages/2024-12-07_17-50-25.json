        "content": "So the zoo has 20 acres of land to create an exhibit for giraffes, elephants, and zebras. Each type of animal requires a specific amount of space: giraffes need at least 3 acres each, elephants need 2 acres each, and zebras need 1 acre each. The goal is to maximize the total number of animals in the exhibit while respecting these space requirements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand that the more space an animal requires, the fewer of that animal can be housed in the given area. Since giraffes need 3 acres each, they take up the most space, followed by elephants at 2 acres each, and zebras at 1 acre each. To maximize the number of animals, it makes sense to prioritize housing more of the animals that require less space.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- G = number of giraffes\n\n- E = number of elephants\n\n- Z = number of zebras\n\nThe total area used by all animals should not exceed 20 acres:\n\n3G + 2E + Z \u2264 20\n\nOur objective is to maximize the total number of animals:\n\nTotal animals = G + E + Z\n\nTo maximize G + E + Z, given the constraint 3G + 2E + Z \u2264 20, we should minimize the amount of space per animal. This means prioritizing animals that require less space, which are zebras, followed by elephants, and then giraffes.\n\nLet's consider different scenarios based on how many of each animal are included.\n\n**Scenario 1: All zebras**\n\nIf we only have zebras, each needing 1 acre:\n\nZ = 20 (since 1*20 = 20)\n\nTotal animals = 20\n\n**Scenario 2: All elephants**\n\nIf we only have elephants, each needing 2 acres:\n\nE = 10 (since 2*10 = 20)\n\nTotal animals = 10\n\n**Scenario 3: All giraffes**\n\nIf we only have giraffes, each needing 3 acres:\n\nG = 6 (since 3*6 = 18), with 2 acres left over\n\nTotal animals = 6\n\nClearly, Scenario 1 gives us the maximum number of animals. But perhaps a combination of different animals could yield a higher total.\n\n**Scenario 4: Some giraffes and the rest zebras**\n\nLet\u2019s say we have 1 giraffe:\n\nSpace used: 3*1 = 3 acres\n\nRemaining space: 20 - 3 = 17 acres\n\nNumber of zebras: 17 (since 1*17 = 17)\n\nTotal animals: 1 + 17 = 18\n\nCompare to Scenario 1 (20 animals), this is worse.\n\nTry 2 giraffes:\n\nSpace used: 3*2 = 6 acres\n\nRemaining space: 20 - 6 = 14 acres\n\nNumber of zebras: 14\n\nTotal animals: 2 + 14 = 16\n\nWorse than Scenario 1.\n\nTry 3 giraffes:\n\nSpace used: 3*3 = 9 acres\n\nRemaining space: 11 acres\n\nNumber of zebras: 11\n\nTotal animals: 3 + 11 = 14\n\nStill worse.\n\nPattern here is that adding giraffes reduces the total number of animals, so it's better to have all zebras.\n\n**Scenario 5: Some elephants and the rest zebras**\n\nLet\u2019s have 1 elephant:\n\nSpace used: 2*1 = 2 acres\n\nRemaining space: 18 acres\n\nNumber of zebras: 18\n\nTotal animals: 1 + 18 = 19\n\nBetter than all elephants (10 animals), but worse than all zebras (20 animals).\n\nTry 2 elephants:\n\nSpace used: 4 acres\n\nRemaining space: 16 acres\n\nNumber of zebras: 16\n\nTotal animals: 2 + 16 = 18\n\nWorse than all zebras.\n\nTry 3 elephants:\n\nSpace used: 6 acres\n\nRemaining space: 14 acres\n\nNumber of zebras: 14\n\nTotal animals: 3 + 14 = 17\n\nStill worse.\n\nAgain, adding elephants reduces the total number of animals compared to all zebras.\n\n**Scenario 6: Some giraffes, some elephants, and some zebras**\n\nLet\u2019s try 1 giraffe and 1 elephant:\n\nSpace used: 3 + 2 = 5 acres\n\nRemaining space: 15 acres\n\nNumber of zebras: 15\n\nTotal animals: 1 + 1 + 15 = 17\n\nWorse than all zebras.\n\nTry 1 giraffe and 2 elephants:\n\nSpace used: 3 + 4 = 7 acres\n\nRemaining space: 13 acres\n\nNumber of zebras: 13\n\nTotal animals: 1 + 2 + 13 = 16\n\nStill worse.\n\nTry 2 giraffes and 1 elephant:\n\nSpace used: 6 + 2 = 8 acres\n\nRemaining space: 12 acres\n\nNumber of zebras: 12\n\nTotal animals: 2 + 1 + 12 = 15\n\nWorse.\n\nIt seems that any combination including giraffes and/or elephants reduces the total number of animals compared to having only zebras.\n\n**Scenario 7: Mix of elephants and zebras**\n\nFrom earlier scenarios, it's clear that adding elephants reduces the total number of animals compared to all zebras.\n\nSimilarly, adding giraffes also reduces the total.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of animals is achieved by housing only zebras, totaling 20 animals.\n\nHowever, the zoo might have other considerations besides just maximizing the number of animals, such as educational value, visitor attraction, or conservation priorities, which might require having a certain number of giraffes or elephants.\n\nBut strictly in terms of maximizing the number of animals within the space constraints, the optimal configuration is 20 zebras.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
