        "content": "So there are 5 apples and 3 oranges in a basket, making a total of 8 fruits. I need to find the probability that both fruits picked were apples, and I'm putting the first fruit back before picking the second one. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since I'm putting the fruit back after the first pick, the total number of fruits remains the same for both picks. So, each pick is independent of the other.\n\nThe probability of picking an apple on the first pick is the number of apples divided by the total number of fruits. That would be 5 apples out of 8 fruits, so 5/8.\n\nSince I'm putting it back, the probability of picking an apple on the second pick is the same, 5/8.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening\u2014picking an apple both times\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the probability of both picks being apples is (5/8) * (5/8).\n\nLet me calculate that: 5 times 5 is 25, and 8 times 8 is 64, so it's 25/64.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that I'm not missing anything. Is there any other way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nAnother way is to think about the total possible outcomes. Since each pick is independent and there are 8 fruits each time, there are 8 options for the first pick and 8 for the second, making 64 total possible outcomes.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is picking an apple both times. There are 5 apples, so 5 options for the first pick and 5 for the second, making 25 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability is favorable outcomes over total outcomes, which is 25/64. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe using probabilities of not picking an apple?\n\nWell, the probability of not picking an apple both times would be picking an orange both times. There are 3 oranges, so the probability for each pick is 3/8. So, (3/8)*(3/8) = 9/64.\n\nBut that's not relevant to the question, which is about picking apples both times.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability of picking at least one apple, but again, the question is specifically about both being apples.\n\nSo, I think 25/64 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the order matters. In this case, since I'm picking one after the other with replacement, and I care about both being apples, the order doesn't really matter. It's the same as picking two apples in any order.\n\nWait, but since it's with replacement, the order doesn't change the probability.\n\nI think I've covered it adequately. The probability is 25/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{64}} \\]"
