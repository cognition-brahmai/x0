        "content": "So there are 10 red balls and 6 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 16 balls. I need to find the probability of drawing one red and one blue ball without replacement. Okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a ball, I don't put it back into the bag before drawing the second ball. So, the total number of balls decreases after the first draw.\n\nNow, the problem is to draw one red and one blue ball. It didn't specify the order, so it could be red first then blue, or blue first then red. I need to consider both scenarios.\n\nLet me first calculate the probability of drawing a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 10/16.\n\nAfter drawing a red ball, there are now 9 red balls and 6 blue balls left, making a total of 15 balls.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a blue ball second is 6/15.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing red first and then blue is (10/16) * (6/15).\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of drawing a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue ball first is 6/16.\n\nAfter drawing a blue ball, there are now 10 red balls and 5 blue balls left, making a total of 15 balls.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red ball second is 10/15.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing blue first and then red is (6/16) * (10/15).\n\nSince either order is acceptable, I need to add these two probabilities together to get the total probability of drawing one red and one blue ball.\n\nSo, total probability = (10/16 * 6/15) + (6/16 * 10/15).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 10/16 * 6/15 = (10 * 6) / (16 * 15) = 60 / 240 = 1/4.\n\nSecond, 6/16 * 10/15 = (6 * 10) / (16 * 15) = 60 / 240 = 1/4.\n\nAdding them up: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.\n\nWait, that seems too high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about combinations here. Since the order doesn't matter, I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 16 is C(16,2), which is 16*15/2 = 120.\n\nThe number of ways to draw one red and one blue ball is C(10,1) * C(6,1) = 10 * 6 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 60 / 120 = 1/2.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I draw two balls at once without replacement. The probability of drawing one red and one blue ball should be the same as what I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of drawing two red balls or two blue balls and subtract that from 1 to get the probability of drawing one of each.\n\nThe probability of drawing two red balls is C(10,2)/C(16,2) = 45/120 = 3/8.\n\nThe probability of drawing two blue balls is C(6,2)/C(16,2) = 15/120 = 1/8.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing either two red or two blue balls is 3/8 + 1/8 = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not drawing two balls of the same color, which means drawing one red and one blue, is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThis matches my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the first ball can be any color, and then the second ball needs to be the other color.\n\nThe probability that the first ball is red is 10/16, and the second is blue is 6/15.\n\nThe probability that the first ball is blue is 6/16, and the second is red is 10/15.\n\nAdding these probabilities gives (10/16 * 6/15) + (6/16 * 10/15) = 60/240 + 60/240 = 120/240 = 1/2.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so the probability is indeed 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
