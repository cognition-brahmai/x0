        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's create a simple program in C# that demonstrates how to use LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to manipulate collections of objects. We'll cover filtering, sorting, and transforming data.\n\nFirst, make sure you have the necessary using directives at the top of your code file:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\n```\n\nNext, let's define a class to represent some data. For this example, we'll create a `Product` class with properties like `Id`, `Name`, and `Price`.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Product\n{\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public decimal Price { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's create a list of `Product` objects to work with.\n\n```csharp\nList<Product> products = new List<Product>\n{\n    new Product { Id = 1, Name = \"Laptop\", Price = 1200.00m },\n    new Product { Id = 2, Name = \"Smartphone\", Price = 800.00m },\n    new Product { Id = 3, Name = \"Tablet\", Price = 300.00m },\n    new Product { Id = 4, Name = \"Monitor\", Price = 200.00m },\n    new Product { Id = 5, Name = \"Keyboard\", Price = 50.00m }\n};\n```\n\n### Filtering Data with LINQ\n\nLet's say we want to filter the products to get only those that cost more than $100.\n\n```csharp\nvar expensiveProducts = from product in products\n                         where product.Price > 100\n                         select product;\n\nforeach (var product in expensiveProducts)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Id: {product.Id}, Name: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}\");\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, using method syntax:\n\n```csharp\nvar expensiveProductsMethod = products.Where(p => p.Price > 100);\n\nforeach (var product in expensiveProductsMethod)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Id: {product.Id}, Name: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}\");\n}\n```\n\n### Sorting Data with LINQ\n\nNow, let's sort the products by price in ascending order.\n\n```csharp\nvar sortedProducts = from product in products\n                     orderby product.Price\n                     select product;\n\nforeach (var product in sortedProducts)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Id: {product.Id}, Name: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}\");\n}\n```\n\nUsing method syntax:\n\n```csharp\nvar sortedProductsMethod = products.OrderBy(p => p.Price);\n\nforeach (var product in sortedProductsMethod)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Id: {product.Id}, Name: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}\");\n}\n```\n\n### Transforming Data with LINQ\n\nSuppose we want to create a list of strings that contain the name and price of each product.\n\n```csharp\nvar productDetails = from product in products\n                     select $\"{product.Name}: ${product.Price}\";\n\nforeach (var detail in productDetails)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(detail);\n}\n```\n\nUsing method syntax:\n\n```csharp\nvar productDetailsMethod = products.Select(p => $\"{p.Name}: ${p.Price}\");\n\nforeach (var detail in productDetailsMethod)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(detail);\n}\n```\n\n### Combining Operations\n\nWe can also chain multiple operations together. For example, let's filter products that cost more than $100, sort them by price in descending order, and then select their names.\n\n```csharp\nvar expensiveProductNames = from product in products\n                             where product.Price > 100\n                             orderby product.Price descending\n                             select product.Name;\n\nforeach (var name in expensiveProductNames)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(name);\n}\n```\n\nUsing method syntax:\n\n```csharp\nvar expensiveProductNamesMethod = products\n    .Where(p => p.Price > 100)\n    .OrderByDescending(p => p.Price)\n    .Select(p => p.Name);\n\nforeach (var name in expensiveProductNamesMethod)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(name);\n}\n```\n\n### Full Program\n\nHere's the complete program putting all the above parts together:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\n\npublic class Product\n{\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public decimal Price { get; set; }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        List<Product> products = new List<Product>\n        {\n            new Product { Id = 1, Name = \"Laptop\", Price = 1200.00m },\n            new Product { Id = 2, Name = \"Smartphone\", Price = 800.00m },\n            new Product { Id = 3, Name = \"Tablet\", Price = 300.00m },\n            new Product { Id = 4, Name = \"Monitor\", Price = 200.00m },\n            new Product { Id = 5, Name = \"Keyboard\", Price = 50.00m }\n        };\n\n        // Filtering\n        var expensiveProducts = from product in products\n                                 where product.Price > 100\n                                 select product;\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Expensive Products:\");\n        foreach (var product in expensiveProducts)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Id: {product.Id}, Name: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}\");\n        }\n\n        // Sorting\n        var sortedProducts = from product in products\n                             orderby product.Price\n                             select product;\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"\\nSorted Products by Price:\");\n        foreach (var product in sortedProducts)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Id: {product.Id}, Name: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}\");\n        }\n\n        // Transforming\n        var productDetails = from product in products\n                             select $\"{product.Name}: ${product.Price}\";\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"\\nProduct Details:\");\n        foreach (var detail in productDetails)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(detail);\n        }\n\n        // Combining operations\n        var expensiveProductNames = from product in products\n                                     where product.Price > 100\n                                     orderby product.Price descending\n                                     select product.Name;\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"\\nExpensive Product Names (Descending by Price):\");\n        foreach (var name in expensiveProductNames)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(name);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates basic LINQ operations in C#, including filtering, sorting, and transforming data. You can expand on these concepts to handle more complex data manipulations as needed."
