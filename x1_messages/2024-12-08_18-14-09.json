        "content": "So, let's see. There are 5 rows of desks in the classroom, and each row has 6 desks. That means there are 5 times 6, which is 30 desks in total. Now, each desk seats 2 students, so to find out how many students the classroom can accommodate, I need to multiply the number of desks by the number of students per desk. So, 30 desks times 2 students per desk would be 60 students. Therefore, the classroom can accommodate 60 students.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If each row has 6 desks and each desk seats 2 students, then each row can seat 6 times 2, which is 12 students. And since there are 5 rows, then 5 times 12 would also be 60 students. Yeah, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of total seating capacity. If there are 5 rows with 6 desks each, that's 30 desks, and each desk seats 2 students, so overall seating capacity is 30 times 2, which again is 60 students.\n\nI think no matter which way I approach this, the answer comes out to be 60 students. So, I'm confident that's the correct number the classroom can accommodate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
