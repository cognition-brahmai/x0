        "content": "So there are 100 people in a room, with 50 wearing red hats and 50 wearing blue hats. We need to find the probability that if we pick two people at random, both of them are wearing red hats.\n\nFirst, let's remember what probability is. Probability is like figuring out the chances of something happening. It's calculated by dividing the number of ways something can happen by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose any two people from the 100 people in the room. And the number of ways something can happen is the number of ways to choose two people who both have red hats.\n\nSo, to find the total number of ways to choose any two people from 100, we use something called combinations. Combinations help us figure out how many ways we can select items from a larger set without regard to the order.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items.\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\n- \\( n! \\) means the factorial of \\( n \\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 people from 100 is:\n\n\\[\nC(100, 2) = \\frac{100!}{2!(100 - 2)!} = \\frac{100!}{2! \\times 98!}\n\\]\n\nNow, 100! is a really big number, but we can simplify this. Notice that 100! is 100 \u00d7 99 \u00d7 98!, so the 98! cancels out:\n\n\\[\nC(100, 2) = \\frac{100 \\times 99 \\times 98!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 98!} = \\frac{100 \\times 99}{2} = 4950\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 4,950 possible ways to choose any two people from the room.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose two people who both have red hats. There are 50 people with red hats.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 red-hatted people from 50 is:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50!}{2!(50 - 2)!} = \\frac{50!}{2! \\times 48!}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, 50! is 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48!, so the 48! cancels out:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 48!} = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} = 1225\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 1,225 ways to choose two people who both have red hats.\n\nNow, the probability that both selected people have red hats is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{1225}{4950}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 25:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1225 \\div 25}{4950 \\div 25} = \\frac{49}{198}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{49}{198} \\).\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate this probability step by step, considering the selection of the first and second person separately.\n\nFirst, the probability that the first person selected has a red hat. Since there are 50 red-hatted people out of 100, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first red}) = \\frac{50}{100} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nNext, given that the first person selected has a red hat, there are now 49 red-hatted people left out of the remaining 99 people. So, the probability that the second person also has a red hat is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{49}{99}\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability that both events happen (both people have red hats), we multiply these probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{first red}) \\times P(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{49}{99} = \\frac{49}{198}\n\\]\n\nSo, again, we get the same result: \\( \\frac{49}{198} \\).\n\nWe can also express this probability as a decimal or a percentage.\n\nFirst, divide 49 by 198:\n\n\\[\n49 \\div 198 \\approx 0.2475\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2475, or 24.75%.\n\nTherefore, there's about a 24.75% chance that both selected people will be wearing red hats.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider the general formula for the probability of selecting k items with a certain characteristic from a population of n items, where there are m items with that characteristic. This is given by the hypergeometric distribution:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\frac{C(m, k) \\times C(n - m, 2 - k)}{C(n, 2)}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, n = 100, m = 50 (red-hatted people), k = 2.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\frac{C(50, 2) \\times C(50, 0)}{C(100, 2)} = \\frac{1225 \\times 1}{4950} = \\frac{1225}{4950} = \\frac{49}{198}\n\\]\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same probability.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if the room had a different number of red and blue hats, or if we were selecting a different number of people, the calculation would adjust accordingly.\n\nFor example, if there were 60 red-hatted people and 40 blue-hatted people, and we wanted to select three people, the probability that all three have red hats would be calculated similarly, but with different numbers.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to find the probability that at least one person has a red hat, we could calculate it by subtracting the probability that both have blue hats from 1.\n\nIn this problem, though, we're only asked for the probability that both selected people have red hats, which we've found to be \\( \\frac{49}{198} \\), or approximately 24.75%.\n\nIt's always a good idea to double-check our calculations to ensure accuracy. Let's verify the combination calculations.\n\nFirst, \\( C(100, 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(100, 2) = \\frac{100 \\times 99}{2} = 4950\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, \\( C(50, 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(50, 2) = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} = 1225\n\\]\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nThen, the probability:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{1225}{4950} = \\frac{49}{198}\n\\]\n\nYes, that reduces correctly.\n\nAlternatively, using the step-by-step approach:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first red}) = \\frac{50}{100} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{49}{99}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{49}{99} = \\frac{49}{198}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\( \\frac{49}{198} \\), or approximately 24.75%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{198}} \\]"
