        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the baker uses 4 eggs to make a batch of 12 cupcakes. We need to find out how many eggs she needs for 60 cupcakes. Okay, first things first, I need to understand the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cupcakes.\n\nOption 1: Proportional Reasoning\n\nI know that if 4 eggs make 12 cupcakes, then maybe I can find out how many eggs are needed for one cupcake and then multiply that by 60. So, let's see:\n\n4 eggs / 12 cupcakes = (4/12) eggs per cupcake = 1/3 egg per cupcake.\n\nNow, for 60 cupcakes, I would need 60 * (1/3) eggs = 20 eggs.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but let me check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nOption 2: Scaling Up the Batch\n\nAnother approach is to see how many batches of 12 cupcakes are there in 60 cupcakes. So, 60 divided by 12 is 5. That means, she needs 5 times the number of eggs used in one batch.\n\nSince one batch uses 4 eggs, 5 batches would use 5 * 4 = 20 eggs.\n\nThis matches the first method, which is a good sign.\n\nOption 3: Using Ratios\n\nI can set up a ratio to solve this problem. The ratio of eggs to cupcakes is 4:12, and I need to find out how many eggs (let's call it x) are needed for 60 cupcakes. So, the ratio is 4/12 = x/60.\n\nTo find x, I can cross-multiply: 4 * 60 = 12 * x \u21d2 240 = 12x \u21d2 x = 240 / 12 \u21d2 x = 20.\n\nAgain, the same answer, 20 eggs.\n\nOption 4: Considering Efficiency or Waste\n\nWait a minute, maybe in reality, the baker doesn't use exactly 1/3 egg per cupcake. Perhaps there's some efficiency in using whole eggs for larger batches, or maybe there's some egg leftover that can be used for another batch.\n\nBut, based on the information given, it seems like the relationship is direct, and there's no mention of any waste or efficiency factors. So, it's probably best to stick with the straightforward proportional reasoning.\n\nOption 5: Unit Conversion Approach\n\nSometimes, it helps to think in terms of units. Here, eggs are being converted to cupcakes.\n\nGiven: 4 eggs \u2192 12 cupcakes.\n\nWe need: ? eggs \u2192 60 cupcakes.\n\nThis is similar to converting units, where we can use a conversion factor.\n\nUsing the conversion factor: (4 eggs)/(12 cupcakes).\n\nSo, eggs needed = 60 cupcakes * (4 eggs)/(12 cupcakes) = 60 * (4/12) eggs = 60 * (1/3) eggs = 20 eggs.\n\nAgain, the answer is 20 eggs.\n\nRanking the Options:\n\n1. Proportional Reasoning: This is direct and straightforward, using division and multiplication to find the unknown.\n\n2. Scaling Up the Batch: This method is also straightforward and relies on multiplying the known batch size to match the desired quantity.\n\n3. Using Ratios: Setting up a ratio and solving for the unknown is a classic mathematical approach and confirms the answer obtained from other methods.\n\n4. Considering Efficiency or Waste: While this could be a consideration in real life, there's no information provided to suggest that efficiency or waste factors are at play here. Therefore, this option is less relevant based on the given information.\n\n5. Unit Conversion Approach: This method is analogous to converting units and reinforces the answer obtained through other methods.\n\nBest Possible Output:\n\nBased on the consistent results from multiple methods\u2014proportional reasoning, scaling up the batch, using ratios, and a unit conversion approach\u2014the baker needs 20 eggs to bake 60 cupcakes. This answer is supported by direct mathematical relationships and does not require any additional assumptions beyond the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
