        "content": "So I have this problem here: In a certain city, 60% of people own cats, 40% own dogs, and 20% own both cats and dogs. I need to find out what percentage of people in the city do not own any pets. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that to find the percentage of people who own either a cat or a dog or both, I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That means I add the percentages of cat owners and dog owners and then subtract the percentage that owns both, to avoid double-counting those who own both pets.\n\nSo, the formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cat owners or Dog owners} = \\text{Cat owners} + \\text{Dog owners} - \\text{Both cat and dog owners}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n60\\% + 40\\% - 20\\% = 80\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, 80% of people own either a cat, a dog, or both.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of people who do not own any pets, I need to subtract this number from 100%, because 100% represents the entire population of the city.\n\n\\[\n100\\% - 80\\% = 20\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 20% of people in the city do not own any pets.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let me double-check. If 60% own cats and 40% own dogs, and 20% own both, then the total percentage of pet owners should indeed be 80%, as calculated. And since the total population is 100%, subtracting the pet owners should give me the non-pet owners.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of Venn diagrams. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents cat owners (60%), the other represents dog owners (40%), and the overlapping area represents those who own both (20%).\n\nSo, the part that only owns cats would be 60% - 20% = 40%, only owns dogs would be 40% - 20% = 20%, and both is 20%. Adding those up: 40% + 20% + 20% = 80%, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the percentage that owns no pets is indeed 20%.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors to consider. For example, maybe some people own other pets besides cats and dogs. However, the problem specifically mentions only cats and dogs, so we can assume that any pet ownership is limited to these two types for the purposes of this problem.\n\nAlso, the problem states that 20% own both cats and dogs, which we've accounted for in the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 20% is the correct answer for the percentage of people who do not own any pets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
