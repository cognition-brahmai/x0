        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. We have three friends: Olivia, Noah, and Lily, watching a peacock near its enclosure at the zoo.\n\nFirst, Olivia distracts the others and secretly guides the peacock into a small shed nearby. So, at this point, Olivia knows that she has moved the peacock from near the enclosure into the shed.\n\nNext, Noah discovers the peacock in the shed and decides to move it back to its enclosure when no one is looking. So now, Noah knows that he has moved the peacock from the shed back to the enclosure.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily spots a different peacock outside the enclosure and assumes it's the same one they saw earlier. This is interesting because it introduces a second peacock into the scenario.\n\nNow, we need to figure out where each of them thinks the original peacock is located.\n\nLet's start with Olivia. She knows she guided the original peacock into the shed. She doesn't know that Noah later moved it back to the enclosure because she wasn't present for that action. Therefore, Olivia probably thinks the original peacock is still in the shed.\n\nMoving on to Noah. He knows that he moved the peacock from the shed back to the enclosure. He assumes that the peacock is now back where it should be, in its enclosure. He doesn't know about Lily seeing a different peacock, so he believes the original peacock is in the enclosure.\n\nFinally, Lily saw a different peacock outside the enclosure and assumed it was the same one they saw earlier. This means she thinks the original peacock is outside the enclosure, but in reality, it's a different peacock.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Olivia thinks the original peacock is in the shed.\n\n- Noah thinks it's back in the enclosure.\n\n- Lily thinks it's outside the enclosure, but it's actually a different peacock.\n\nThis situation has led to some confusion among the friends due to the secret movements and the presence of another peacock. It's a bit of a tangled scenario!"
