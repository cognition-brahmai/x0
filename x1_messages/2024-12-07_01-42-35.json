        "content": "Let's see. There are 50 students in the class, and the average score for all of them is 75%. That means the total score for all students combined is 50 times 75%, right? So, 50 times 75% equals... let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that 75% is the same as 0.75 in decimal form. So, 50 times 0.75 is 37.5. But wait, that doesn't seem right because if each student has a score, the total score should be higher. Maybe I should think in terms of percentages of the total possible score. Hmm.\n\nActually, perhaps I should consider that the average score is 75% , meaning that the sum of all scores divided by 50 equals 75%. So, sum of all scores = 50 * 75 = 3750, assuming the test is out of 100. Yeah, that makes more sense.\n\nNow, the top 10 students scored an average of 90%. So, their total score is 10 * 90 = 900.\n\nTo find the average score of the remaining 40 students, I need to find the total score of these 40 students and then divide by 40.\n\nThe total score of all 50 students is 3750, and the top 10 have a total of 900, so the remaining 40 students must have a total score of 3750 - 900 = 2850.\n\nTherefore, the average score for the remaining 40 students is 2850 divided by 40.\n\nLet me calculate that: 2850 / 40 = 71.25%.\n\nSo, the average score for the remaining 40 students is 71.25%.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of weighted averages. The overall average is a weighted average of the top 10 students' average and the remaining 40 students' average.\n\nSo, the formula for the overall average is:\n\n(10/50)*90% + (40/50)*x = 75%,\n\nwhere x is the average score of the remaining 40 students.\n\nSimplifying, (1/5)*90 + (4/5)*x = 75.\n\nCalculating, 18 + (4/5)x = 75.\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides: (4/5)x = 57.\n\nNow, solve for x: x = 57 * (5/4) = 71.25%.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average score for the remaining 40 students is indeed 71.25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{71.25\\%} \\]"
