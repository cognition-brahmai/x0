        "content": "To determine how many liters of water a cylindrical tank can hold when filled to capacity, we need to calculate the volume of the cylinder and then convert that volume from cubic meters to liters.\n\nFirst, recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[V = \\pi r^2 h\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(V\\) is the volume,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the radius of the base,\n\n- \\(h\\) is the height of the cylinder,\n\n- and \\(\\pi\\) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven that the height \\(h\\) is 10 meters and the radius \\(r\\) is 4 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[V = \\pi (4)^2 (10)\\]\\[V = \\pi (16) (10)\\]\\[V = 160\\pi \\, \\text{cubic meters}\\]\n\nNow, to get a numerical value, we can approximate \\(\\pi\\) as 3.14159:\n\n\\[V \\approx 160 \\times 3.14159\\]\\[V \\approx 502.6544 \\, \\text{cubic meters}\\]\n\nSince 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters, we can convert the volume to liters by multiplying by 1000:\n\n\\[502.6544 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\times 1000 \\, \\text{L/m}^3 = 502,654.4 \\, \\text{liters}\\]\n\nTherefore, the tank can hold approximately 502,654.4 liters of water when filled to capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{502654.4} \\]"
