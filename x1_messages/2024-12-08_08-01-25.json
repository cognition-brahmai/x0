        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a group of 12 men and 8 women, making a total of 20 people. We need to form a committee of 5 people from this group, and the committee must include at least one woman. We're asked to find out how many different committees can be created under these conditions.\n\nFirst, I think it's important to understand what \"at least one woman\" means. It means that the committee can have 1 woman, or 2, or 3, up to all 5 women, but it can't have zero women. So, we need to count all the possible committees that have at least one woman.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that have no women at all. This way, we're left with the number of committees that have at least one woman.\n\nLet's start by calculating the total number of possible committees from the 20 people, without any restrictions. This is a combination problem because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of committees is \\( C(20, 5) \\).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 5) = \\frac{20!}{5!(20 - 5)!} = \\frac{20!}{5! \\times 15!}\n\\]\n\nI don't need to calculate the full factorials because a lot of terms will cancel out. Let's write it out:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 5) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15!}{5! \\times 15!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{5!}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(20, 5) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{120}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the numerator:\n\n20 \u00d7 19 = 380\n\n380 \u00d7 18 = 6840\n\n6840 \u00d7 17 = 116280\n\n116280 \u00d7 16 = 1,860,480\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n1,860,480 \u00f7 120 = 15,504\n\nSo, there are 15,504 possible committees without any restrictions.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of committees that have no women, meaning all members are men. There are 12 men in the group, so we need to choose 5 men out of 12.\n\nThis is again a combination problem: \\( C(12, 5) \\).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12!}{5!(12 - 5)!} = \\frac{12!}{5! \\times 7!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{5! \\times 7!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{5!}\n\\]\n\nWe already know that \\( 5! = 120 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{120}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n\n12 \u00d7 11 = 132\n\n132 \u00d7 10 = 1,320\n\n1,320 \u00d7 9 = 11,880\n\n11,880 \u00d7 8 = 95,040\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n95,040 \u00f7 120 = 792\n\nSo, there are 792 committees consisting of only men.\n\nNow, to find the number of committees that have at least one woman, we subtract the number of all-men committees from the total number of committees:\n\n15,504 - 792 = 14,712\n\nTherefore, there are 14,712 different committees that can be created which include at least one woman.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, \\( C(20, 5) = 15,504 \\), which seems correct.\n\nThen, \\( C(12, 5) = 792 \\), which also seems correct.\n\nSubtracting them gives 15,504 - 792 = 14,712.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about calculating the number of committees with at least one woman directly, without using the total minus the all-men committees. But that would involve calculating the sum of committees with 1 woman, 2 women, up to 5 women, which would be more time-consuming.\n\nLet me verify if my approach is valid. By subtracting the all-men committees from the total, I should indeed get the number of committees that have at least one woman. That seems logically sound.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the alternative approach.\n\nThe number of committees with at least one woman can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of committees with 1 woman and 4 men + number with 2 women and 3 men + number with 3 women and 2 men + number with 4 women and 1 man + number with 5 women and 0 men.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\n\\( C(8, 1) \\times C(12, 4) + C(8, 2) \\times C(12, 3) + C(8, 3) \\times C(12, 2) + C(8, 4) \\times C(12, 1) + C(8, 5) \\times C(12, 0) \\)\n\nLet's calculate each term separately.\n\nFirst, \\( C(8, 1) \\times C(12, 4) \\):\n\n\\( C(8, 1) = 8 \\)\n\n\\( C(12, 4) = \\frac{12!}{4!(12 - 4)!} = \\frac{12!}{4! \\times 8!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{24 \\times 8!} = \\frac{11,880}{24} = 495 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 8 \\times 495 = 3,960 \\)\n\nNext, \\( C(8, 2) \\times C(12, 3) \\):\n\n\\( C(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 6!} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28 \\)\n\n\\( C(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3!(12 - 3)!} = \\frac{12!}{6 \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9!}{6 \\times 9!} = \\frac{1,320}{6} = 220 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 28 \\times 220 = 6,160 \\)\n\nNext, \\( C(8, 3) \\times C(12, 2) \\):\n\n\\( C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{6 \\times 5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{6 \\times 5!} = \\frac{56}{1} = 56 \\)\n\n\\( C(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 56 \\times 66 = 3,696 \\)\n\nNext, \\( C(8, 4) \\times C(12, 1) \\):\n\n\\( C(8, 4) = \\frac{8!}{24 \\times 4!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{24 \\times 4!} = \\frac{1,680}{24} = 70 \\)\n\n\\( C(12, 1) = 12 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 70 \\times 12 = 840 \\)\n\nLastly, \\( C(8, 5) \\times C(12, 0) \\):\n\n\\( C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = 56 \\) (since \\( C(n, k) = C(n, n - k) \\))\n\n\\( C(12, 0) = 1 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 56 \\times 1 = 56 \\)\n\nNow, sum all these up:\n\n3,960 + 6,160 = 10,120\n\n10,120 + 3,696 = 13,816\n\n13,816 + 840 = 14,656\n\n14,656 + 56 = 14,712\n\nLook at that! We get the same answer as before: 14,712.\n\nSo, both approaches confirm that there are 14,712 different committees that include at least one woman.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14712} \\]"
