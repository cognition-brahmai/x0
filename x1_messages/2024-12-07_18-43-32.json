        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to develop a Golang command-line tool that interacts with an Elasticsearch cluster to import data from a CSV file. Sounds interesting! Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Elasticsearch is. From what I know, Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library, designed for use in production environments on distributed servers. It is open source and written in Java. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time. So, interacting with it from a Go program should be manageable.\n\nNow, the tool needs to accept several input parameters:\n\n- Elasticsearch host: This is the hostname or IP address where the Elasticsearch server is running.\n\n- Port: The port number on which Elasticsearch is listening, usually 9200 by default.\n\n- Index name: The name of the index in Elasticsearch where the data will be imported.\n\n- Path to the CSV file: The location of the CSV file that contains the data to be imported.\n\nAdditionally, there are some optional parameters:\n\n- Delimiter: The character that separates values in the CSV file. Comma is the default, but it could be tab, semicolon, etc.\n\n- Quote character: The character used for quoting fields that contain special characters, like the delimiter itself.\n\n- Column mappings: This likely means specifying how columns in the CSV map to fields in the Elasticsearch document.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to set up a Go project. I'll create a new directory for this tool, say, `es-importer`, and initialize it as a Go module.\n\nNext, I need to handle command-line arguments. Go has a built-in package for that, called `flag`. I can define flags for each of the required and optional parameters. For example:\n\n- `-host` or `--host` for the Elasticsearch host\n\n- `-port` or `--port` for the port number\n\n- `-index` or `--index` for the index name\n\n- `-file` or `--file` for the path to the CSV file\n\n- `-delimiter` or `--delimiter` for the CSV delimiter\n\n- `-quote` or `--quote` for the quote character\n\n- `-mapping` or `--mapping` for column mappings\n\nFor column mappings, I might need to accept a list of key-value pairs, where the key is the CSV column header and the value is the Elasticsearch field name.\n\nNow, to interact with Elasticsearch from Go, I need a client library. A quick search reveals that there's an official Elasticsearch Go client, which should be reliable and feature-rich. I'll need to include that in my project using `go get`.\n\nOnce I have the client set up, I need to establish a connection to the Elasticsearch cluster using the provided host and port. I should also verify that the connection is successful before proceeding.\n\nAfter that, I need to read the CSV file specified by the user. Go has a `encoding/csv` package that can handle reading CSV files, and it allows specifying custom delimiters and quote characters. I'll use that to parse the file.\n\nOnce the CSV file is parsed, I need to map the columns to Elasticsearch fields based on the user-provided mappings. If no mappings are provided, maybe I can assume that the CSV headers match the Elasticsearch field names.\n\nThen, I need to bulk import the data into Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch has a bulk API that allows efficient insertion of multiple documents in a single request. I should use this API to minimize the number of requests and maximize performance.\n\nI should also handle any errors that occur during the import process, such as connection errors, parsing errors, or indexing errors, and provide meaningful error messages to the user.\n\nLet me think about the flow of the program:\n\n1. Parse command-line arguments using the `flag` package.\n\n2. Validate the required parameters are provided.\n\n3. Set up the Elasticsearch client with the provided host and port.\n\n4. Check if the connection to Elasticsearch is successful.\n\n5. Read the CSV file using the specified path, delimiter, and quote character.\n\n6. If column mappings are provided, map the CSV columns to Elasticsearch fields; otherwise, use CSV headers as field names.\n\n7. Prepare bulk indexing requests for the Elasticsearch client.\n\n8. Execute the bulk request and handle any errors.\n\n9. Provide feedback to the user about the success or failure of the import.\n\nThat seems like a solid plan. Now, let's think about some edge cases and how to handle them.\n\n- If the Elasticsearch cluster is not reachable, the program should inform the user about the connection failure.\n\n- If the CSV file doesn't exist or can't be read, handle the file I/O error gracefully.\n\n- If the CSV file has rows with different numbers of columns, which could indicate malformed rows, decide how to handle such cases. Maybe skip problematic rows or abort the import.\n\n- If the user-provided column mappings are invalid or incomplete, provide an error message indicating the issue.\n\n- Consider large CSV files that might not fit into memory all at once. Maybe implement streaming or process the file in chunks to avoid memory issues.\n\nPerformance is likely to be a concern for large datasets, so optimizing the bulk import is important. Elasticsearch recommends keeping bulk request sizes between 5 and 15 MB for optimal performance.\n\nI should also think about how to structure the command-line tool. Maybe provide some help text for users to understand how to use the tool and what each parameter does.\n\nAdditionally, for the column mappings, I need to decide on a format that's easy for users to specify. Perhaps accept a comma-separated list of mappings in the format `csv_header1:es_field1,csv_header2:es_field2`, etc.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the code structure.\n\nFirst, import the necessary packages:\n\n```go\n\nimport (\n\n    \"flag\"\n\n    \"encoding/csv\"\n\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"os\"\n\n    \"github.com/olivere/elastic/v7\"\n\n)\n\n```\n\nDefine the main function:\n\n```go\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    // Define and parse command-line flags\n\n    host := flag.String(\"host\", \"localhost\", \"Elasticsearch host\")\n\n    port := flag.Int(\"port\", 9200, \"Elasticsearch port\")\n\n    index := flag.String(\"index\", \"\", \"Index name\")\n\n    file := flag.String(\"file\", \"\", \"Path to CSV file\")\n\n    delimiter := flag.String(\"delimiter\", \",\", \"CSV delimiter\")\n\n    quote := flag.String(\"quote\", \"\\\"\", \"Quote character\")\n\n    mapping := flag.String(\"mapping\", \"\", \"Column mappings\")\n\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    // Validate required parameters\n\n    if *index == \"\" || *file == \"\" {\n\n        fmt.Println(\"Index name and file path are required.\")\n\n        flag.PrintDefaults()\n\n        os.Exit(1)\n\n    }\n\n    // Set up Elasticsearch client\n\n    connStr := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s:%d\", *host, *port)\n\n    client, err := elastic.NewClient(elastic.SetURL(connStr))\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error creating Elasticsearch client: %s\\n\", err)\n\n        os.Exit(1)\n\n    }\n\n    // Check connection\n\n    info, err := client.Ping(connStr).Do(context.Background())\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error pinging Elasticsearch: %s\\n\", err)\n\n        os.Exit(1)\n\n    }\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"Elasticsearch version: %s\\n\", info.Version.Number)\n\n    // Read CSV file\n\n    f, err := os.Open(*file)\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error opening CSV file: %s\\n\", err)\n\n        os.Exit(1)\n\n    }\n\n    r := csv.NewReader(f)\n\n    r.Comma = rune(*delimiter[0])\n\n    r.Quoting = csv.QuoteAll\n\n    r.Comment = '#'\n\n    // Read all records\n\n    records, err := r.ReadAll()\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error reading CSV records: %s\\n\", err)\n\n        os.Exit(1)\n\n    }\n\n    // Handle column mappings\n\n    mappings := make(map[string]string)\n\n    if *mapping != \"\" {\n\n        mappingPairs := strings.Split(*mapping, \",\")\n\n        for _, pair := range mappingPairs {\n\n            parts := strings.Split(pair, \":\")\n\n            if len(parts) == 2 {\n\n                mappings[parts[0]] = parts[1]\n\n            } else {\n\n                fmt.Printf(\"Invalid mapping: %s\\n\", pair)\n\n                os.Exit(1)\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Prepare bulk requests\n\n    bulkService := client.Bulk()\n\n    for i, record := range records {\n\n        if i == 0 {\n\n            // Assuming first row is headers\n\n            headers := record\n\n            for j, header := range headers {\n\n                esField := header\n\n                if mapping, ok := mappings[header]; ok {\n\n                    esField = mapping\n\n                }\n\n                // Create JSON document\n\n                doc := make(map[string]interface{})\n\n                doc[esField] = record[j]\n\n                // Add to bulk request\n\n                bulkService.Add(elastic.NewBulkIndexRequest().Index(*index).Doc(doc))\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            // Handle data rows\n\n            // Similar to above, but using mappings\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Execute bulk request\n\n    bulkResponse, err := bulkService.Do(context.Background())\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error executing bulk request: %s\\n\", err)\n\n        os.Exit(1)\n\n    }\n\n    // Print bulk response\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"Bulk import completed. Took: %d ms\\n\", bulkResponse.TookInMillis)\n\n}\n\n```\n\nWait a minute, there are a few issues with this outline.\n\nFirst, in the CSV reading part, I'm assuming that the first row contains headers, and then mapping those headers to Elasticsearch fields. However, in the bulk indexing loop, I'm iterating over all records, including the header row. I need to skip the header row when indexing the data.\n\nAlso, in the bulk indexing loop, I'm adding a request for each column in the header row, which doesn't seem right. Typically, each row in the CSV corresponds to one document in Elasticsearch.\n\nLet me rethink this.\n\nI should read the CSV file, treating the first row as headers. Then, based on the mappings provided by the user, map the CSV columns to Elasticsearch field names. Then, for each data row, create an Elasticsearch document with the mapped fields and add it to the bulk request.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV headers.\n\n2. If mappings are provided, use them to map CSV headers to Elasticsearch fields; otherwise, use CSV headers as field names.\n\n3. For each data row, create an Elasticsearch document where each field is populated from the corresponding column in the CSV row.\n\n4. Add each document to the bulk request.\n\n5. Execute the bulk request.\n\nLet me adjust the code outline accordingly.\n\nFirst, read the headers:\n\n```go\n\nheaders, err := r.Read()\n\nif err != nil {\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"Error reading CSV headers: %s\\n\", err)\n\n    os.Exit(1)\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, set up the mappings:\n\n```go\n\nmappings := make(map[string]string)\n\nif *mapping != \"\" {\n\n    mappingPairs := strings.Split(*mapping, \",\")\n\n    for _, pair := range mappingPairs {\n\n        parts := strings.Split(pair, \":\")\n\n        if len(parts) == 2 {\n\n            mappings[parts[0]] = parts[1]\n\n        } else {\n\n            fmt.Printf(\"Invalid mapping: %s\\n\", pair)\n\n            os.Exit(1)\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Create a slice to hold the mapped field names in the same order as the CSV columns\n\nmappedFields := make([]string, len(headers))\n\nfor i, header := range headers {\n\n    if mapping, ok := mappings[header]; ok {\n\n        mappedFields[i] = mapping\n\n    } else {\n\n        mappedFields[i] = header\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, read the data rows:\n\n```go\n\nrecords, err := r.ReadAll()\n\nif err != nil {\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"Error reading CSV records: %s\\n\", err)\n\n    os.Exit(1)\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNow, `records` contains all the data rows.\n\nThen, prepare the bulk requests:\n\n```go\n\nbulkService := client.Bulk()\n\nfor _, record := range records {\n\n    if len(record) != len(mappedFields) {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Skipping row with incorrect number of columns: %v\\n\", record)\n\n        continue\n\n    }\n\n    doc := make(map[string]interface{})\n\n    for i, value := range record {\n\n        doc[mappedFields[i]] = value\n\n    }\n\n    bulkRequest := elastic.NewBulkIndexRequest().Index(*index).Doc(doc)\n\n    bulkService.Add(bulkRequest)\n\n}\n\n```\n\nFinally, execute the bulk request:\n\n```go\n\nbulkResponse, err := bulkService.Do(context.Background())\n\nif err != nil {\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"Error executing bulk request: %s\\n\", err)\n\n    os.Exit(1)\n\n}\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Bulk import completed. Took: %d ms\\n\", bulkResponse.TookInMillis)\n\n```\n\nThis seems better. I need to make sure that the CSV file has the same number of columns in each row; otherwise, the mapping might fail. I can add checks to skip rows with incorrect column counts or handle them according to user preferences.\n\nAlso, I should consider handling different data types. Currently, all values are treated as strings, but Elasticsearch can handle different data types like integers, floats, dates, etc. Maybe provide an option for the user to specify the data types for each field.\n\nAdditionally, for large CSV files, reading the entire file into memory might not be feasible. In such cases, I can read the CSV file row by row and add documents to the bulk request in chunks, flushing the bulk request periodically to avoid memory issues.\n\nGo's `csv.Reader` can read the file row by row, which is memory-efficient.\n\nLet me adjust the code to read the CSV file row by row and perform bulk indexing in chunks.\n\nFirst, set up the bulk service with a reasonable number of operations per request. Elasticsearch recommends keeping the bulk request size between 5 and 15 MB.\n\nAssuming an average document size, I can set a chunk size, say, 500 documents per bulk request.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n```go\n\nchunkSize := 500 // Number of documents per bulk request\n\nbulkService := client.Bulk()\n\ncount := 0\n\nfor {\n\n    record, err := r.Read()\n\n    if err == csv.ErrFieldCount {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Skipping row with incorrect number of columns: %v\\n\", record)\n\n        continue\n\n    } else if err == io.EOF {\n\n        break\n\n    } else if err != nil {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error reading CSV record: %s\\n\", err)\n\n        os.Exit(1)\n\n    }\n\n    if len(record) != len(mappedFields) {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Skipping row with incorrect number of columns: %v\\n\", record)\n\n        continue\n\n    }\n\n    doc := make(map[string]interface{})\n\n    for i, value := range record {\n\n        doc[mappedFields[i]] = value\n\n    }\n\n    bulkRequest := elastic.NewBulkIndexRequest().Index(*index).Doc(doc)\n\n    bulkService.Add(bulkRequest)\n\n    count++\n\n    if count%chunkSize == 0 {\n\n        // Execute bulk request\n\n        bulkResponse, err := bulkService.Do(context.Background())\n\n        if err != nil {\n\n            fmt.Printf(\"Error executing bulk request: %s\\n\", err)\n\n            os.Exit(1)\n\n        }\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Imported %d documents. Took: %d ms\\n\", count, bulkResponse.TookInMillis)\n\n        // Prepare for next chunk\n\n        bulkService = client.Bulk()\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Import any remaining documents\n\nif bulkService.NumberOfActions() > 0 {\n\n    bulkResponse, err := bulkService.Do(context.Background())\n\n    if err != nil {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error executing bulk request: %s\\n\", err)\n\n        os.Exit(1)\n\n    }\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"Imported remaining %d documents. Took: %d ms\\n\", bulkService.NumberOfActions(), bulkResponse.TookInMillis)\n\n}\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Total documents imported: %d\\n\", count)\n\n```\n\nThis way, I'm processing the CSV file row by row and accumulating documents in the bulk request until the chunk size is reached, then executing the bulk request and resetting it for the next chunk. This should be more memory-efficient for large CSV files.\n\nI should also consider adding options for the user to specify the chunk size and the number of concurrent bulk requests, but that might complicate the tool. For now, a simple chunk-based approach should suffice.\n\nAnother consideration is handling errors during bulk indexing. Elasticsearch's bulk API returns detailed information about the success or failure of each operation. I should parse the bulk response and report any failures to the user, perhaps listing which documents failed to index and why.\n\nHere's how I can handle the bulk response:\n\n```go\n\nfor _, item := range bulkResponse.Items {\n\n    if item.Index.Error != nil {\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error indexing document: %s\\n\", item.Index.Error.Error())\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis will print any errors encountered during indexing.\n\nFurthermore, I can add options for creating the index if it doesn't exist, and specifying the document type (although in Elasticsearch 7.x, the concept of types is deprecated, so perhaps skip that).\n\nI should also think about mapping the fields in Elasticsearch to match the data types in the CSV. For example, if a column contains integers, I might want to define the corresponding field in Elasticsearch as a long or integer type.\n\nTo handle this, I could add an option for the user to provide a mapping definition in JSON format, which can be used to create the index with the specified mappings.\n\nAlternatively, Elasticsearch can infer the mapping based on the first few documents indexed, but this might not always be accurate.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple and let Elasticsearch handle the mapping inference.\n\nAnother feature to consider is the ability to specify options for overwriting existing documents or updating them. Elasticsearch bulk API allows for index, create, update, and delete operations.\n\nFor this tool, since it's primarily for importing data, index operations should suffice. If a document with the same ID already exists, it will be overwritten.\n\nBut perhaps I can add an option for the user to specify an ID field from the CSV, so that documents can be uniquely identified.\n\nFor example, add a `--id-field` flag that specifies which CSV column should be used as the document _id in Elasticsearch.\n\nThis can be useful for ensuring idempotent imports or updating existing documents.\n\nLet me add that to the list of possible features.\n\nAlso, consider adding a verbose mode where the tool prints more detailed information about its progress, such as the number of records processed, time taken, etc.\n\nNow, let's think about testing this tool. I need to have a test Elasticsearch cluster set up, preferably locally, to verify that the tool can connect, create an index, and import data from a sample CSV file.\n\nI can use Docker to spin up an Elasticsearch container for testing purposes.\n\nAdditionally, I should create sample CSV files with different delimiters, quote characters, and column mappings to ensure that the tool handles them correctly.\n\nI should also test edge cases, such as:\n\n- CSV files with headers that contain spaces or special characters.\n\n- CSV files with rows that have missing or extra columns.\n\n- Elasticsearch cluster that is not running or unreachable.\n\n- Incorrectly specified parameters.\n\n- Large CSV files to test performance and memory usage.\n\nI should handle these cases gracefully, providing useful error messages to the user.\n\nMoreover, I need to ensure that the tool is robust and doesn't crash on unexpected input. For example, handle nil pointers, empty strings, and other potential pitfalls in Go.\n\nAlso, consider adding unit tests for individual components of the tool, such as parsing command-line flags, reading CSV files, and preparing bulk requests.\n\nHowever, writing integration tests that actually connect to an Elasticsearch cluster might be more involved, but useful for ensuring end-to-end functionality.\n\nNow, regarding the Elasticsearch client library, I need to make sure it's up to date and compatible with the version of Elasticsearch I'm using.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the official Elasticsearch Go client is `github.com/olivere/elastic`, and there are different versions corresponding to Elasticsearch major versions.\n\nI need to check which version is compatible with the Elasticsearch cluster that the tool will be used with.\n\nAssuming the user is running Elasticsearch 7.x, I should use a compatible version of the Go client.\n\nI should also handle deprecations and changes in the Elasticsearch API across different versions.\n\nMoreover, I need to handle contexts properly in Go to manage request timeouts and cancellations, especially for long-running imports.\n\nIn the code outline above, I used `context.Background()`, but in a real-world scenario, I should use a context with a timeout or cancellation signal.\n\nFor example:\n\n```go\n\nctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Minute)\n\ndefer cancel()\n\n```\n\nThis sets a 5-minute timeout for the operation.\n\nI should also handle the case where the context is canceled or times out, and inform the user accordingly.\n\nAnother consideration is handling bulk API errors more gracefully. Elasticsearch bulk API can return partial failures, where some operations succeed and others fail.\n\nI should aggregate all errors and report them to the user at the end, perhaps logging the errors or skipping problematic documents based on user preferences.\n\nAdditionally, I can add options for the user to specify bulk request parameters, such as `refresh`, `pipeline`, or `op_type`.\n\nFor example, the `pipeline` parameter can be used to specify an ingest pipeline that processes the document before indexing.\n\nI can add a `--pipeline` flag for this purpose.\n\nSimilarly, the `op_type` can be set to `index` or `create`. By default, it's `index`, which will overwrite existing documents.\n\nIf the user wants to prevent overwriting existing documents, they can set `op_type` to `create`.\n\nI can add a `--op-type` flag for this.\n\nMoreover, I can add options for specifying Elasticsearch HTTP auth credentials, if the cluster requires authentication.\n\nThis can be done by adding `--username` and `--password` flags and configuring the Elasticsearch client accordingly.\n\nAlso, consider supporting HTTPS connections with optional verification of TLS certificates.\n\nThis can be achieved by adding flags for `--insecure-skip-verify` or similar.\n\nFurthermore, I can add options for specifying the Elasticsearch index settings and mappings, allowing the user to create the index with custom configurations.\n\nThis can be done by adding a `--settings` flag that accepts a JSON string or a file path, and a `--mappings` flag similarly.\n\nBefore importing data, the tool can check if the index exists, and if not, create it with the provided settings and mappings.\n\nIf the index already exists, the tool can either proceed with the import or prompt the user to avoid overwriting existing data.\n\nI need to be cautious with this to avoid accidental data loss.\n\nAnother feature could be to support CSV files with headers in different rows or multiple header rows, but that might be overkill for now.\n\nI should prioritize implementing the core functionality first and then add additional features based on user\u9700\u6c42.\n\nNow, let's think about how to handle data types in the CSV file.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, all values are treated as strings by default. However, Elasticsearch can infer data types based on the input, but sometimes it's better to explicitly define them.\n\nOne way to handle this is to let the user provide a mapping definition in JSON format, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt to infer the data types from the CSV values themselves.\n\nFor example, if a column contains integers, treat them as longs; if they contain floats, treat them as doubles; if they look like dates, treat them as date types, and so on.\n\nThis can be done by adding a type inference step when reading the CSV headers.\n\nBut this might be too complex for a initial version of the tool. For now, I'll keep it simple and treat all values as strings, relying on Elasticsearch's dynamic mapping to handle the types.\n\nIf time permits, I can implement basic type inference based on the first few rows of data.\n\nAnother consideration is handling CSV files with quoted fields that span multiple lines. Go's `csv.Reader` can handle this if the `LazilyQuoteFields` option is set to true.\n\nI should make sure to handle such cases correctly.\n\nAlso, consider adding a progress indicator for large imports, so the user can see the progress of the tool.\n\nThis can be achieved using a progress bar library in Go, such as `github.com/schollz/progressbar/v3`.\n\nI can update the progress bar as chunks of documents are indexed.\n\nNow, let's think about the command-line interface (CLI) and how to make it user-friendly.\n\nI need to provide clear help text for each flag, explaining what it does and any expected format.\n\nI can use the `flag` package's `Usage` function to print usage information.\n\nAdditionally, I can use a more advanced CLI library like `cobra` to structure the tool and provide subcommands, but for simplicity, I'll stick with the standard `flag` package.\n\nI should also validate the input parameters to ensure they make sense.\n\nFor example, the port number should be a valid integer within the allowed range.\n\nThe CSV file path should exist and be readable.\n\nThe Elasticsearch host should be a valid hostname or IP address.\n\nI can add validation checks for these parameters before proceeding with the import.\n\nMoreover, I can add a verbose flag, say `--verbose` or `-v`, that enables more detailed logging during the import process.\n\nThis can help users troubleshoot issues or understand what's happening under the hood.\n\nIn summary, here's a list of features and considerations for the tool:\n\n1. Accept command-line flags for Elasticsearch host, port, index name, CSV file path, delimiter, quote character, column mappings, and other optional parameters.\n\n2. Validate required parameters and provide helpful error messages.\n\n3. Set up an Elasticsearch client and verify the connection.\n\n4. Read the CSV file using the specified delimiter and quote character.\n\n5. Handle CSV headers and map them to Elasticsearch field names based on user-provided mappings.\n\n6. Prepare bulk indexing requests in chunks to handle large CSV files efficiently.\n\n7. Execute bulk requests and handle any errors, providing feedback to the user.\n\n8. Optionally, create the index with custom settings and mappings if it doesn't exist.\n\n9. Consider adding options for specifying document IDs, bulk request parameters, and authentication credentials.\n\n10. Implement basic type inference or allow users to specify field data types.\n\n11. Provide a verbose mode for detailed logging.\n\n12. Add unit and integration tests to ensure the tool works as expected.\n\n13. Consider using a progress bar for large imports.\n\n14. Handle edge cases and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nThis seems like a comprehensive plan. Now, I need to proceed step by step, implementing each part and testing it along the way.\n\nI'll start by setting up the Go project and defining the command-line flags.\n\nThen, I'll handle the Elasticsearch client setup and connection verification.\n\nAfter that, I'll work on reading the CSV file and parsing it according to the specified parameters.\n\nNext, I'll implement the column mappings and prepare the bulk indexing requests.\n\nFinally, I'll execute the bulk requests and handle the responses.\n\nThroughout this process, I'll write tests and handle any errors that may occur.\n\nOnce the core functionality is complete, I can add additional features based on user feedback and requirements.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Golang command-line tool that imports data from a CSV file into an Elasticsearch cluster, follow the steps below. This tool will accept parameters for the Elasticsearch host, port, index name, and CSV file path, along with optional parameters for delimiter, quote character, and column mappings.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"flag\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"io\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"strings\"\n    \"github.com/olivere/elastic/v7\"\n    \"encoding/csv\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Define and parse command-line flags\n    host := flag.String(\"host\", \"localhost\", \"Elasticsearch host\")\n    port := flag.Int(\"port\", 9200, \"Elasticsearch port\")\n    index := flag.String(\"index\", \"\", \"Index name\")\n    file := flag.String(\"file\", \"\", \"Path to CSV file\")\n    delimiter := flag.String(\"delimiter\", \",\", \"CSV delimiter\")\n    quote := flag.String(\"quote\", \"\\\"\", \"Quote character\")\n    mapping := flag.String(\"mapping\", \"\", \"Column mappings\")\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    // Validate required parameters\n    if *index == \"\" || *file == \"\" {\n        fmt.Println(\"Index name and file path are required.\")\n        flag.PrintDefaults()\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n\n    // Set up Elasticsearch client\n    connStr := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s:%d\", *host, *port)\n    client, err := elastic.NewClient(elastic.SetURL(connStr))\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error creating Elasticsearch client: %s\\n\", err)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n\n    // Check connection\n    info, err := client.Ping(connStr).Do(context.Background())\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error pinging Elasticsearch: %s\\n\", err)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"Elasticsearch version: %s\\n\", info.Version.Number)\n\n    // Read CSV file\n    f, err := os.Open(*file)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error opening CSV file: %s\\n\", err)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    defer f.Close()\n\n    r := csv.NewReader(f)\n    r.Comma = rune(*delimiter[0])\n    r.Quoting = csv.QuoteAll\n    r.Comment = '#'\n\n    // Read headers\n    headers, err := r.Read()\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error reading CSV headers: %s\\n\", err)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n\n    // Handle column mappings\n    mappings := make(map[string]string)\n    if *mapping != \"\" {\n        mappingPairs := strings.Split(*mapping, \",\")\n        for _, pair := range mappingPairs {\n            parts := strings.Split(pair, \":\")\n            if len(parts) == 2 {\n                mappings[parts[0]] = parts[1]\n            } else {\n                fmt.Printf(\"Invalid mapping: %s\\n\", pair)\n                os.Exit(1)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Create a slice to hold the mapped field names in the same order as the CSV columns\n    mappedFields := make([]string, len(headers))\n    for i, header := range headers {\n        if mapping, ok := mappings[header]; ok {\n            mappedFields[i] = mapping\n        } else {\n            mappedFields[i] = header\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Prepare bulk requests in chunks\n    chunkSize := 500 // Number of documents per bulk request\n    bulkService := client.Bulk()\n    count := 0\n\n    for {\n        record, err := r.Read()\n        if err == csv.ErrFieldCount {\n            fmt.Printf(\"Skipping row with incorrect number of columns: %v\\n\", record)\n            continue\n        } else if err == io.EOF {\n            break\n        } else if err != nil {\n            fmt.Printf(\"Error reading CSV record: %s\\n\", err)\n            os.Exit(1)\n        }\n\n        if len(record) != len(mappedFields) {\n            fmt.Printf(\"Skipping row with incorrect number of columns: %v\\n\", record)\n            continue\n        }\n\n        doc := make(map[string]interface{})\n        for i, value := range record {\n            doc[mappedFields[i]] = value\n        }\n\n        bulkRequest := elastic.NewBulkIndexRequest().Index(*index).Doc(doc)\n        bulkService.Add(bulkRequest)\n        count++\n\n        if count%chunkSize == 0 {\n            // Execute bulk request\n            bulkResponse, err := bulkService.Do(context.Background())\n            if err != nil {\n                fmt.Printf(\"Error executing bulk request: %s\\n\", err)\n                os.Exit(1)\n            }\n            fmt.Printf(\"Imported %d documents.
