        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a small town with 20 houses, and each house has at least one cat and at least one dog. Each cat can catch 3 mice per day, and each dog can catch 5 mice per day. We need to find the minimum number of mice caught daily in the entire town.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We're looking for the smallest possible number of mice that get caught every day in this town, given the number of houses and the catching abilities of the cats and dogs.\n\nSince each house has at least one cat and one dog, that means every house has some cats and some dogs, but the problem doesn't specify how many cats or dogs per house beyond that there's at least one of each.\n\nTo minimize the total number of mice caught, I should try to minimize the number of cats and dogs in the town because more animals would catch more mice.\n\nGiven that each house must have at least one cat and one dog, the minimal setup per house is one cat and one dog.\n\nSo, for 20 houses, that's 20 cats and 20 dogs.\n\nNow, each cat catches 3 mice per day, so 20 cats would catch 20 * 3 = 60 mice per day.\n\nEach dog catches 5 mice per day, so 20 dogs would catch 20 * 5 = 100 mice per day.\n\nAdding those up, the total number of mice caught per day would be 60 (from cats) + 100 (from dogs) = 160 mice.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there a way to have fewer mice caught? Maybe if some houses have more than one cat or dog, but the problem says each house has at least one of each, so I can't have houses with only cats or only dogs; they must have at least one of each.\n\nSo, the minimal configuration is indeed one cat and one dog per house.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of mice caught daily in the entire town is 160.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me double-check.\n\nIf I try to have fewer cats or dogs, but the problem states that each house has at least one of each, so I can't reduce the number below that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to calculate this differently, but I think this straightforward approach is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 160 mice caught daily.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
