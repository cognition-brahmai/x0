        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a company that sells two products, X and Y. Each unit of X brings in a profit of $10, and each unit of Y brings in $15. The goal is to make at least $5,000 in profit for the month. We need to find out the minimum number of units they must sell in total to hit that target.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of units of product X sold.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of units of product Y sold.\n\nGiven that, the total profit \\( P \\) from selling these products would be:\n\n\\[ P = 10x + 15y \\]\n\nThe company wants this profit to be at least $5,000, so:\n\n\\[ 10x + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\nOur task is to find the minimum value of \\( x + y \\), given this inequality.\n\nThis is an optimization problem with a linear constraint. To minimize \\( x + y \\) under the constraint \\( 10x + 15y \\geq 5000 \\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider the geometry of the feasible region. However, since this seems like it might be a problem for introductory algebra or optimization, let's try a more straightforward approach.\n\nOne way to approach this is to express one variable in terms of the other using the constraint and then substitute it into the total units equation.\n\nLet\u2019s solve the constraint for one of the variables. I'll solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 10x + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5 to simplify:\n\n\\[ 2x + 3y \\geq 1000 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 3y \\geq 1000 - 2x \\]\n\n\\[ y \\geq \\frac{1000 - 2x}{3} \\]\n\nNow, the total units sold is \\( x + y \\). To minimize \\( x + y \\), we can substitute the expression for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ x + y \\geq x + \\frac{1000 - 2x}{3} \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify this:\n\n\\[ x + y \\geq x + \\frac{1000}{3} - \\frac{2x}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x + y \\geq \\left(x - \\frac{2x}{3}\\right) + \\frac{1000}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x + y \\geq \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{1000}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x + y \\geq \\frac{x + 1000}{3} \\]\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that to minimize the total number of units sold, the company should maximize the profit per unit. Since product Y has a higher profit per unit ($15 vs. $10), the company should sell as much of product Y as possible to minimize the total units needed to reach $5,000.\n\nSo, if the company sells only product Y, how many units would they need to sell?\n\n\\[ 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\n\\[ y \\geq \\frac{5000}{15} \\]\n\n\\[ y \\geq 333.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nSince they can't sell a fraction of a unit, they would need to sell at least 334 units of product Y to meet the profit goal.\n\nIn this case, the total units sold would be 334.\n\nBut maybe there's a combination of X and Y that allows them to sell fewer total units.\n\nLet\u2019s consider selling some units of X and some of Y.\n\nSuppose they sell \\( x \\) units of X and \\( y \\) units of Y, with:\n\n\\[ 10x + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\nAnd we want to minimize \\( x + y \\).\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, and the minimum will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by:\n\n\\[ 10x + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\nAnd \\( x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTo find the vertices, we can consider the intersection points of the boundary with the axes.\n\nFirst, when \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 15y = 5000 \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{5000}{15} \\approx 333.333 \\]\n\nSo, one vertex is \\( (0, 333.\\overline{3}) \\).\n\nNext, when \\( y = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 10x = 5000 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 500 \\]\n\nSo, another vertex is \\( (500, 0) \\).\n\nNow, since the objective function is to minimize \\( x + y \\), and the feasible region is above the line \\( 10x + 15y = 5000 \\), the minimum will occur at one of these vertices.\n\nAt \\( (0, 333.\\overline{3}) \\):\n\n\\[ x + y = 0 + 333.\\overline{3} = 333.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nAt \\( (500, 0) \\):\n\n\\[ x + y = 500 + 0 = 500 \\]\n\nSo, the minimum total units is at \\( (0, 333.\\overline{3}) \\), which means selling 334 units of Y (since we can't sell a fraction).\n\nBut let's check if there's a combination of X and Y that could result in fewer total units.\n\nSuppose they sell some units of X and Y such that \\( 10x + 15y = 5000 \\), and \\( x + y \\) is minimized.\n\nWe can express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{5000 - 15y}{10} = 500 - 1.5y \\]\n\nThen, total units \\( x + y = 500 - 1.5y + y = 500 - 0.5y \\)\n\nTo minimize \\( x + y \\), we need to maximize \\( y \\), since it's subtracted.\n\nBut \\( y \\) can't be more than 333.\\overline{3} }, as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, actually, to minimize \\( x + y = 500 - 0.5y \\), we need to maximize \\( y \\), but \\( y \\) is constrained by \\( y \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x = 500 - 1.5y \\geq 0 \\), which implies \\( y \\leq \\frac{500}{1.5} \\approx 333.\\overline{3} \\).\n\nSo, the maximum \\( y \\) is 333.\\overline{3} }, which corresponds to \\( x = 500 - 1.5 \\times 333.\\overline{3} = 500 - 500 = 0 \\), which is the point \\( (0, 333.\\overline{3}) \\) we already considered.\n\nTherefore, the minimum total units is indeed 334 units, all of product Y.\n\nBut let's consider if selling a combination of X and Y could lead to fewer total units.\n\nSuppose they sell 1 unit of X, then:\n\n\\[ 10(1) + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\n\\[ 10 + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\n\\[ 15y \\geq 4990 \\]\n\n\\[ y \\geq \\frac{4990}{15} \\approx 332.666 \\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 333 \\), since we can't sell a fraction.\n\nTotal units: \\( x + y = 1 + 333 = 334 \\), same as before.\n\nWait, but 10(1) + 15(333) = 10 + 4995 = 5005, which is greater than 5000.\n\nSo, total units are still 334.\n\nLet\u2019s try selling 2 units of X:\n\n\\[ 10(2) + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\n\\[ 20 + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\n\\[ 15y \\geq 4980 \\]\n\n\\[ y \\geq 332 \\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 332 \\), since it's an integer.\n\nTotal units: \\( 2 + 332 = 334 \\), same as before.\n\nWait, but 10(2) + 15(332) = 20 + 4980 = 5000 exactly.\n\nSo, total units are 334.\n\nIs there a combination where total units are less than 334?\n\nLet\u2019s try selling 3 units of X:\n\n\\[ 10(3) + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\n\\[ 30 + 15y \\geq 5000 \\]\n\n\\[ 15y \\geq 4970 \\]\n\n\\[ y \\geq 331.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 332 \\).\n\nTotal units: \\( 3 + 332 = 335 \\), which is higher than 334.\n\nWait, this is more than 334.\n\nSo, in this case, total units increase.\n\nSimilarly, if we sell more units of X, the total units tend to increase because we're replacing higher-profit units (Y) with lower-profit units (X), thus needing more units to reach the same profit.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total units is indeed 334, achieved by selling either:\n\n- 0 units of X and 334 units of Y, or\n\n- 2 units of X and 332 units of Y.\n\nIn both cases, total units are 334.\n\nSo, the minimum number of units they must sell is 334.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{334} \\]"
