        "content": "To design a SQL query that finds the top 5 best-selling products in each category over the last month in a hypothetical e-commerce database, we need to make some assumptions about the database schema. Let's assume the database has the following relevant tables:\n\n1. **Categories**:\n   - CategoryID (Primary Key)\n   - CategoryName\n\n2. **Products**:\n   - ProductID (Primary Key)\n   - ProductName\n   - CategoryID (Foreign Key referencing Categories.CategoryID)\n\n3. **Orders**:\n   - OrderID (Primary Key)\n   - OrderDate\n\n4. **OrderDetails**:\n   - OrderDetailID (Primary Key)\n   - OrderID (Foreign Key referencing Orders.OrderID)\n   - ProductID (Foreign Key referencing Products.ProductID)\n   - Quantity\n\nGiven this schema, our goal is to identify the top 5 best-selling products in each category based on the total quantity sold over the last month.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Filter Orders by Date**: First, filter the orders to include only those from the last month.\n2. **Join Tables**: Join the Orders, OrderDetails, Products, and Categories tables to relate orders to products and categories.\n3. **Calculate Total Quantity Sold**: For each product in each category, calculate the total quantity sold.\n4. **Rank Products within Each Category**: Use window functions to rank products within each category based on the total quantity sold.\n5. **Select Top 5 Products per Category**: Select the top 5 products in each category based on the rank.\n\n### Solution Query\n\n```sql\nWITH RecentOrders AS (\n    SELECT OrderID\n    FROM Orders\n    WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(month, -1, GETDATE())\n),\nCategoryProductSales AS (\n    SELECT\n        C.CategoryID,\n        C.CategoryName,\n        P.ProductID,\n        P.ProductName,\n        SUM(OD.Quantity) AS TotalQuantitySold\n    FROM\n        RecentOrders RO\n        JOIN OrderDetails OD ON RO.OrderID = OD.OrderID\n        JOIN Products P ON OD.ProductID = P.ProductID\n        JOIN Categories C ON P.CategoryID = C.CategoryID\n    GROUP BY\n        C.CategoryID, C.CategoryName, P.ProductID, P.ProductName\n),\nRankedProducts AS (\n    SELECT\n        CategoryID,\n        CategoryName,\n        ProductID,\n        ProductName,\n        TotalQuantitySold,\n        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID ORDER BY TotalQuantitySold DESC) AS Rank\n    FROM\n        CategoryProductSales\n)\nSELECT\n    CategoryID,\n    CategoryName,\n    ProductID,\n    ProductName,\n    TotalQuantitySold\nFROM\n    RankedProducts\nWHERE\n    Rank <= 5\nORDER BY\n    CategoryID,\n    Rank;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **RecentOrders CTE**: Filters orders to include only those from the last month.\n2. **CategoryProductSales CTE**: Joins the filtered orders with order details, products, and categories to calculate the total quantity sold for each product in each category.\n3. **RankedProducts CTE**: Ranks the products within each category based on the total quantity sold using the `DENSE_RANK()` window function.\n4. **Final SELECT**: Selects the top 5 ranked products in each category and orders the results by category and rank.\n\nThis query ensures that we get the top 5 best-selling products in each category over the last month, providing valuable insights for inventory management and sales analysis in an e-commerce setting."
