        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a car depreciating in value. It says that the car depreciates by 15% each year, and I need to find out its approximate value after 6 years, given that its initial value is $20,000. Hmm, depreciation\u2014that sounds like it's related to how the value of the car goes down over time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the car to depreciate by 15% each year. Does that mean that every year, the car loses 15% of its value from the previous year? Like, it's a compounding decrease, similar to how interest works in savings accounts, but in reverse?\n\nWait, in savings accounts, interest is typically compounded, meaning you earn interest on the accumulated interest. So, if I'm thinking analogously, depreciation might work in a similar way but decreasing the value each year based on the previous year's value.\n\nSo, if the car is worth $20,000 initially, after the first year, it would depreciate by 15% of $20,000. Let's calculate that:\n\n15% of $20,000 is 0.15 * 20,000 = $3,000.\n\nSo, after the first year, the car would be worth $20,000 - $3,000 = $17,000.\n\nNow, in the second year, it depreciates by 15% again, but this time it's 15% of $17,000.\n\n15% of $17,000 is 0.15 * 17,000 = $2,550.\n\nSo, after the second year, the car would be worth $17,000 - $2,550 = $14,450.\n\nHmm, this seems time-consuming if I have to do this for six years. Maybe there's a better way to calculate this without doing it year by year.\n\nI recall that in finance, there's a formula for exponential decay, which might apply here since the depreciation is a percentage of the previous value each year.\n\nThe general formula for exponential decay is:\n\nFinal value = Initial value * (1 - rate of decay)^time\n\nIn this case, the rate of decay is 15%, or 0.15, and the time is 6 years.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nFinal value = $20,000 * (1 - 0.15)^6\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1 - 0.15 = 0.85\n\nThen, 0.85 raised to the power of 6.\n\nI'm not great at calculating powers in my head, but I think 0.85^2 is 0.7225, and then 0.7225 * 0.85 is approximately 0.614125, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a calculator for this part.\n\nAssuming I have a calculator, 0.85 to the power of 6 is approximately 0.377149.\n\nSo, final value = $20,000 * 0.377149 \u2248 $7,542.98\n\nTherefore, after 6 years, the car's approximate value would be $7,542.98.\n\nBut, I should check if this is the correct approach. Maybe there are different methods or formulas for calculating depreciation.\n\nI've heard of straight-line depreciation, where the value decreases by a fixed amount each year, but in this case, it's a percentage, so it's probably exponential decay, which makes sense for assets like cars.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes depreciation is calculated using a declining balance method, which is also a form of exponential decay.\n\nSo, I think using the exponential decay formula is appropriate here.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see what the value would be after 6 years using this method.\n\nInitial value: $20,000\n\nDepreciation rate: 15% per year\n\nNumber of years: 6\n\nUsing the formula: Final value = $20,000 * (1 - 0.15)^6 = $20,000 * (0.85)^6\n\nAs calculated earlier, (0.85)^6 \u2248 0.377149\n\nSo, $20,000 * 0.377149 \u2248 $7,542.98\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate it year by year, it should give me the same result.\n\nLet's try that to verify.\n\nYear 0: $20,000\n\nYear 1: $20,000 - 0.15*20,000 = $20,000 - $3,000 = $17,000\n\nYear 2: $17,000 - 0.15*17,000 = $17,000 - $2,550 = $14,450\n\nYear 3: $14,450 - 0.15*14,450 = $14,450 - $2,167.50 = $12,282.50\n\nYear 4: $12,282.50 - 0.15*12,282.50 = $12,282.50 - $1,842.375 \u2248 $10,440.125\n\nYear 5: $10,440.125 - 0.15*10,440.125 \u2248 $10,440.125 - $1,566.01875 \u2248 $8,874.10625\n\nYear 6: $8,874.10625 - 0.15*8,874.10625 \u2248 $8,874.10625 - $1,331.1159375 \u2248 $7,542.9903125\n\nSo, after 6 years, the value is approximately $7,542.99, which matches the earlier calculation using the exponential decay formula.\n\nTherefore, the approximate value of the car after 6 years is $7,542.99.\n\nI think that's the answer, but just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect the depreciation.\n\nFor example, sometimes depreciation might follow a different pattern, or there could be residual value considerations. But based on the information given, it seems like straightforward exponential decay based on a constant percentage rate.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the exponential decay formula is the right approach here.\n\nTherefore, the car's approximate value after 6 years is $7,542.99.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7542.99} \\]"
