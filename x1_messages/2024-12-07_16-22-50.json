        "content": "Alright, I need to find out the author and summary of the book \"War and Peace.\" I have a few tools available to help me with this task. Let's see how I can use them step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should use Goodreads because it can retrieve information about books, including authors and summaries. So, I'll input the book title \"War and Peace\" into Goodreads.\n\nPlan: Use Goodreads to find information about \"War and Peace.\"\n\n:Evidence0: = Goodreads[\"War and Peace\"]\n\nNow, based on the information from Goodreads, I should be able to find the author's name and a summary of the book. But just to make sure, maybe I can cross-verify the author's name using another tool like AuthorBio.\n\nPlan: If the author's name is listed in :Evidence0:, use AuthorBio to get more information about the author.\n\n:Evidence1: = AuthorBio[:author_name_from_Evidence0:]\n\nAlso, to get a more detailed summary, I could use the BookSummary tool.\n\nPlan: Use BookSummary to get a brief summary of \"War and Peace.\"\n\n:Evidence2: = BookSummary[\"War and Peace\"]\n\nAlternatively, if Goodreads doesn't provide a sufficient summary, I can use GoogleBooks to search for more information.\n\nPlan: If :Evidence2: is insufficient, use GoogleBooks to search for \"War and Peace.\"\n\n:Evidence3: = GoogleBooks[\"War and Peace\"]\n\nFinally, I can compile the author's name and the summary from these sources to provide the answer.\n\nPlan: Compile the author's name from :Evidence0: or :Evidence1: and the summary from :Evidence2: or :Evidence3:.\n\nAnswer: The author of \"War and Peace\" is [author's name from :Evidence0: or :Evidence1:], and the summary of the book is [summary from :Evidence2: or :Evidence3:]."
