        "content": "To calculate the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval, we need to use the formula:\n\nMargin of Error = Z * (\u03c3 / \u221an)\n\nwhere:\n\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level\n\n- \u03c3 is the population standard deviation\n\n- n is the sample size\n\nGiven:\n\n- Sample mean (x\u0304) = 50\n\n- Population standard deviation (\u03c3) = 10\n\n- Sample size (n) = 100\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval. In a standard normal distribution, a 95% confidence level corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96. This value comes from the properties of the normal distribution, where 95% of the area under the curve lies within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean.\n\nNext, we plug in the values into the formula:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * (10 / \u221a100)\n\nLet's calculate the denominator first:\n\n\u221a100 = 10\n\nSo,\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * (10 / 10) = 1.96 * 1 = 1.96\n\nTherefore, the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.96.\n\nThis means that we can be 95% confident that the true population mean falls within 1.96 units of the sample mean. In other words, the confidence interval would be:\n\nx\u0304 - Margin of Error to x\u0304 + Margin of Error\n\n50 - 1.96 to 50 + 1.96\n\nWhich is approximately 48.04 to 51.96.\n\nIt's important to note that this calculation assumes that the population is normally distributed or that the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply. In this case, with a sample size of 100, the Central Limit Theorem likely holds, even if the population distribution is not perfectly normal.\n\nAdditionally, the margin of error decreases as the sample size increases, which makes sense because larger samples provide more information and thus more precise estimates of the population parameters. Conversely, a smaller sample size would result in a larger margin of error, reflecting greater uncertainty in the estimate.\n\nAlso, the margin of error is directly proportional to the population standard deviation. If the population is more variable, the margin of error will be larger, indicating more uncertainty in the estimate.\n\nFinally, the choice of confidence level affects the margin of error. A higher confidence level, such as 99%, would require a larger Z-score and thus a larger margin of error, reflecting the desire for greater certainty in the estimate.\n\nIn summary, the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval, given a sample mean of 50, a population standard deviation of 10, and a sample size of 100, is approximately 1.96. This provides us with an interval estimate of 48.04 to 51.96 for the true population mean.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.96} \\]"
