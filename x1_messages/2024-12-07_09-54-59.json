        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about apples. There are three types: Red, Green, and Yellow. The ratio of Red to Green to Yellow apples is 4:3:2, and there are a total of 90 apples. I need to find out how many of each type there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio like 4:3:2 tells me that for every 4 Red apples, there are 3 Green apples and 2 Yellow apples. So, the numbers in the ratio represent parts of the whole.\n\nTo find out how many apples of each type there are, I need to figure out what each part in the ratio corresponds to in terms of actual apples.\n\nLet me denote the number of parts for each type:\n\n- Red apples: 4 parts\n\n- Green apples: 3 parts\n\n- Yellow apples: 2 parts\n\nThe total number of parts is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 parts.\n\nNow, since there are 90 apples in total, each part must represent 90 \u00f7 9 = 10 apples.\n\nSo, now I can find the number of each type of apple by multiplying the number of parts by the value of each part.\n\n- Red apples: 4 parts \u00d7 10 apples/part = 40 apples\n\n- Green apples: 3 parts \u00d7 10 apples/part = 30 apples\n\n- Yellow apples: 2 parts \u00d7 10 apples/part = 20 apples\n\nLet me check if this adds up to 90: 40 + 30 + 20 = 90. Perfect!\n\nSo, there are 40 Red apples, 30 Green apples, and 20 Yellow apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 \\text{ Red apples}, 30 \\text{ Green apples}, 20 \\text{ Yellow apples}} \\]"
