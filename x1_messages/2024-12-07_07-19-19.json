        "content": "Let's see, I know that Andrew Jackson was a general in the War of 1812, famous for his victory at the Battle of New Orleans. Now, I need to think about other U.S. presidents who also fought in that war. Hmm, James Madison was the president during the War of 1812, but he wasn't a military leader in the war. So, he doesn't count. Let's think about some other presidents from that time period.\n\nThere was James Monroe; he was involved in the war, wasn't he? Yes, Monroe held several positions during the war, including as a diplomat and as the Secretary of War under James Madison. But I'm not sure if he personally fought in any battles. Maybe he did.\n\nWait, there's also Zachary Taylor. He was a general in the Mexican-American War, and he became president later. But that was a different war. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nLet me check William Henry Harrison. He was involved in the War of 1812; in fact, he led troops in the Battle of the Thames. And he later became president. So, he might be the one.\n\nBut hold on, Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison both fought in the War of 1812, but I need to confirm if Harrison actually fought in that war. I think he did, yes.\n\nAnother one is James Madison, but as I thought earlier, he was the president during the war, but I don't think he personally fought in any battles.\n\nSo, between Jackson and Harrison, both were military leaders in the War of 1812.\n\nBut let me make sure there aren't any others. John Quincy Adams was secretary of state during the war, but not a military leader. So, probably not.\n\nMartin Van Buren wasn't involved in the war, I think. He was too young or not in military service.\n\nSo, I believe William Henry Harrison is the other president who fought in the War of 1812 besides Andrew Jackson.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider some other presidents from that era. James Monroe, as I mentioned earlier, was involved in the war in various capacities. According to some sources, he did serve in the Virginia militia during the war, so it's possible he also fought.\n\nBut compared to Jackson and Harrison, whose military roles were more prominent and well-documented, Monroe's military service might have been more limited.\n\nSo, if I had to pick one other president besides Andrew Jackson who fought in the War of 1812, it would be William Henry Harrison.\n\nBut to confirm, let's look at their careers briefly.\n\nAndrew Jackson: Major general in the United States Army, led the Battle of New Orleans, which was a major victory towards the end of the war.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison: Brigadier general in the Indiana Territory, fought in several battles, including the Battle of the Thames, where he defeated the Shawnee leader Tecumseh.\n\nJames Monroe: He did serve in the Virginia militia, but his roles were more in diplomacy and governance during the war.\n\nSo, based on this, Harrison seems to be the other president who actively fought in the War of 1812.\n\nTherefore, the answer is William Henry Harrison.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{William Henry Harrison}} \\]"
