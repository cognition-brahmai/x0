The BOSS MAN, scary and big, watches everything. The MAN WHO SAYS BAD THINGS, sure and smirky, just finished talking.\n\nOn the other side of the big room is our GOOD GUY LAWYER, CHARLIE RICH-GUY, known for being smart and good at talking. His friend, JOHNNY NO-NAME, a good guy said to do a bad thing he didn't do, looks at him with hopeful eyes.\n\nRICH-GUY stands up, fixes his neck cloth before talking to the room.\n\nRICH-GUY\n(Big and brave)\nLadies and Boys of the jury, my smart friend wants you to think that Johnny No-Name did the bad thing for sure. But I'm here today to show you he didn't.\n\nRich-Guy walks around the big room, looking at each jury person as he keeps talking.\n\nRICH-GUY\nLet's think about the proof... or really, the no proof. No finger pictures on the bad thing. No body stuff linking my friend to the place. Actually, the only thing connecting Mr. No-Name to this bad thing is the words of one not-sure person.\n\nHe stops for a bit, letting his words go in before talking more.\n\nRICH-GUY\nAnd now, let me show you something new.\n\nRich-Guy goes into his bag and takes out some papers. He gives them to the PAPER GUY who gives them to the BOSS MAN.\n\nRICH-GUY\nThese are phone writings showing that my friend was talking to his sister when the bad thing happened. A talk that was 45 minutes, putting him far away from the bad place.\n\nPeople start talking in the big room. The Man Who Says Bad Things looks scared.\n\nRICH-GUY\n(Happy)\nThis isn't just about showing my friend didn't do it. It's about showing the real thing. And the real thing, ladies and boys, is that Johnny No-Name didn't do this bad thing.\n\nAs Rich-Guy sits down, the big room is full of whispers. The Boss Man hits his noise stick, asking for quiet.\n\nEND."

Here's the revised version:\n\n**Scene:**\n\n**Location:** A large courtroom on a sunny day.\n\n**Setting:** The room is filled with anticipation. The **Judge**, stern and authoritative, presides over the proceedings. The **Prosecutor**, confident and smug, has just finished his closing argument.\n\nOn the opposite side of the courtroom is our **Defendant**, **Johnny No-Name**, a good-hearted individual wrongly accused of a crime, looking towards his lawyer with a mix of hope and anxiety.\n\n**Charlie Rich-Guy**, a brilliant and eloquent defense attorney, known for his sharp mind and persuasive skills, stands up, straightens his tie, and addresses the jury.\n\n**Rich-Guy:**\n\n(Loudly and confidently)\n\"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my learned friend has tried to convince you that Johnny No-Name is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. However, I am here to show you that there is no solid evidence to support that claim.\"\n\nRich-Guy paces around the courtroom, making eye contact with each juror as he continues.\n\n**Rich-Guy:**\n\n\"Let's examine the evidence, or rather, the lack thereof. There are no fingerprints on the weapon, no DNA linking my client to the crime scene. In fact, the only connection between Mr. No-Name and this crime is the testimony of a single witness, whose reliability is questionable.\"\n\nHe pauses, allowing his words to sink in before proceeding.\n\n**Rich-Guy:**\n\n\"Now, let me present something new to you.\"\n\nRich-Guy reaches into his briefcase and pulls out some documents. He hands them to the **Clerk**, who in turn presents them to the Judge.\n\n**Rich-Guy:**\n\n\"These are records showing that my client was engaged in a 45-minute phone call with his sister at the time the crime was committed. This places him far away from the crime scene.\"\n\nA murmur runs through the courtroom. The Prosecutor looks taken aback.\n\n**Rich-Guy:**\n\n(Smiling)\n\"This isn't just about proving my client's innocence; it's about upholding the truth. And the truth, ladies and gentlemen, is that Johnny No-Name did not commit this crime.\"\n\nAs Rich-Guy sits down, the courtroom is abuzz with whispers. The Judge taps his gavel, calling for order.\n\n**End Scene.**\n"
