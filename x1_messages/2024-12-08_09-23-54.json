        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains leaving from different towns at the same time, heading towards each other. One is going at 60 km/h from Town A to Town B, and the other is going at 90 km/h from Town B to Town A. The distance between the towns is 300 km. I need to find out when they meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the relative speed is 60 km/h plus 90 km/h, which is 150 km/h. That makes sense because they are approaching each other.\n\nNow, the total distance between the towns is 300 km. If they are moving towards each other with a combined speed of 150 km/h, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their relative speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 300 km / 150 km/h\n\nThat gives:\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nSo, the trains will meet after 2 hours.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way is to think about how much distance each train covers in a given time, and find when the sum of those distances equals the total distance between the towns.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time in hours as t.\n\nThe distance covered by the first train from Town A in time t is 60t km.\n\nThe distance covered by the second train from Town B in time t is 90t km.\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of these distances should be equal to 300 km.\n\nSo:\n\n60t + 90t = 300\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n150t = 300\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 300 / 150\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. Good, it\u2019s consistent.\n\nPerhaps I can consider it another way, using relative speed again, but from a different perspective.\n\nIf I consider one train to be stationary and the other moving towards it at the combined speed, the calculations should be the same.\n\nWait, that\u2019s essentially what relative speed is: considering one object stationary and the other moving at the combined speed.\n\nSo, in this case, if I consider the train from Town A stationary, then the train from Town B is moving towards it at 150 km/h, and the distance is 300 km, so time is again 2 hours.\n\nAlright, I think I\u2019ve confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s think about the positions of the trains at different times.\n\nAfter 1 hour:\n\n- Train from A has traveled 60 km, so it\u2019s 60 km from A, and 240 km from B.\n\n- Train from B has traveled 90 km, so it\u2019s 90 km from B, and 210 km from A.\n\nThey haven\u2019t met yet because their distances from each other are still 240 km and 210 km, which doesn\u2019t add up to 300 km. Wait, actually, after 1 hour, the sum of the distances they\u2019ve traveled is 60 + 90 = 150 km, which is less than 300 km, so they haven\u2019t met yet.\n\nAfter 2 hours:\n\n- Train from A has traveled 120 km, so it\u2019s 120 km from A, and 180 km from B.\n\n- Train from B has traveled 180 km, so it\u2019s 180 km from B, and 120 km from A.\n\nNow, the sum of the distances they\u2019ve traveled is 120 + 180 = 300 km, which is the total distance between the towns. So, they must have met somewhere between Town A and Town B after 2 hours.\n\nLet me see if I can find exactly where they meet.\n\nLet\u2019s use the first approach:\n\nDistance covered by Train A in 2 hours: 60 km/h * 2 h = 120 km\n\nDistance covered by Train B in 2 hours: 90 km/h * 2 h = 180 km\n\nAdding these up: 120 km + 180 km = 300 km, which matches the total distance.\n\nSo, they meet at a point 120 km from Town A and 180 km from Town B.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of relative speed, they cover the 300 km in 2 hours, meeting at that point.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nJust to explore further, what if the speeds were different? Say, Train A is going at 50 km/h and Train B at 100 km/h. Would the calculation change?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nRelative speed: 50 + 100 = 150 km/h\n\nTime to meet: 300 km / 150 km/h = 2 hours\n\nWait, it\u2019s the same time. Is that right?\n\nWait, no. If Train A is slower, it should take longer for them to meet, but in this case, it\u2019s the same time.\n\nWait, no, actually, if Train A is slower and Train B is faster, but their relative speed is still the sum of their speeds, so it would be 50 + 100 = 150 km/h, and time is still 300 / 150 = 2 hours.\n\nSo, even with different speeds, as long as their combined speed is the same, the time to meet remains the same.\n\nBut in the initial problem, with 60 km/h and 90 km/h, their combined speed is also 150 km/h, so time is again 2 hours.\n\nSo, in this specific case, with a different speed for Train A, the time remains the same.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting.\n\nBut actually, if I change the speeds, the time would change only if their combined speed changes.\n\nFor example, if Train A is going at 50 km/h and Train B at 100 km/h, combined speed is 150 km/h, same as before, so time is still 2 hours.\n\nBut if Train A is going at 70 km/h and Train B at 80 km/h, combined speed is 150 km/h, again, time is 2 hours.\n\nSo, as long as their combined speed is 150 km/h, the time to meet will be 2 hours.\n\nUnless I change the combined speed, the time remains the same.\n\nWait, unless I change the distance as well.\n\nIn this specific problem, with a fixed distance of 300 km and a combined speed of 150 km/h, the time is always 2 hours.\n\nSo, in this case, the time to meet is consistent.\n\nAlright, back to the original problem.\n\nI think I\u2019ve confirmed sufficiently that the trains meet after 2 hours.\n\nJust to think about it in another way, perhaps using equations of motion.\n\nLet\u2019s assume they start at time t=0.\n\nPosition of Train A at time t: x_A = 0 + 60t (since it starts at Town A and moves towards Town B)\n\nPosition of Train B at time t: x_B = 300 - 90t (since it starts at Town B and moves towards Town A)\n\nThey meet when x_A = x_B\n\nSo:\n\n60t = 300 - 90t\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\n60t + 90t = 300\n\n150t = 300\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nPerfect, it\u2019s consistent across different methods.\n\nI can also think about it in terms of ratios.\n\nThe speeds are 60 km/h and 90 km/h, so the ratio of their speeds is 60:90, which simplifies to 4:6 or 2:3.\n\nThat means for every 2 parts Train A travels, Train B travels 3 parts.\n\nThe total parts are 2 + 3 = 5 parts.\n\nThe total distance is 300 km, so each part is 300 / 5 = 60 km.\n\nTherefore, Train A travels 2 * 60 = 120 km, and Train B travels 3 * 60 = 180 km before they meet.\n\nThen, time is distance divided by speed.\n\nFor Train A: time = 120 / 60 = 2 hours\n\nFor Train B: time = 180 / 90 = 2 hours\n\nAgain, confirming that they meet after 2 hours.\n\nThis is great; multiple methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI think I\u2019ve thoroughly understood this problem now.\n\nJust to push it a bit further, what if one of the trains starts later?\n\nFor example, what if Train B starts half an hour after Train A?\n\nHow would that affect the meeting time?\n\nLet\u2019s assume Train A starts at t=0 from Town A, and Train B starts at t=0.5 hours from Town B.\n\nThen, the equation changes.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=0.5 hours, only Train A is moving.\n\nIn that time, Train A covers 60 km/h * 0.5 h = 30 km.\n\nSo, at t=0.5 hours, Train A is 30 km from Town A, and Train B starts from Town B.\n\nNow, the remaining distance between the two trains is 300 km - 30 km = 270 km.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, with a combined speed of 60 + 90 = 150 km/h.\n\nTime to cover 270 km at 150 km/h is t = 270 / 150 = 1.8 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time from when Train A starts is 0.5 hours + 1.8 hours = 2.3 hours.\n\nSo, they would meet after 2.3 hours from when Train A starts.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting.\n\nBut in the original problem, both trains start at the same time, so the meeting time is 2 hours.\n\nIf there\u2019s a delay in one train\u2019s start time, it affects the meeting time.\n\nBut in this case, since both start at the same time, it\u2019s straightforward: 2 hours.\n\nI think that covers the problem fully.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
