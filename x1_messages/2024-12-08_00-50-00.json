The basic membership costs $40 per month, and there are 200 basic members. So, we multiply the cost per basic membership by the number of basic members:\n\n$40/member * 200 members = $8,000\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from premium memberships. The premium membership costs $70 per month, and there are 100 premium members. So, we multiply the cost per premium membership by the number of premium members:\n\n$70/member * 100 members = $7,000\n\nNow, to find the total monthly revenue from both types of memberships, we add the revenue from basic memberships and the revenue from premium memberships:\n\n$8,000 + $7,000 = $15,000\n\nTherefore, the company's total monthly revenue from memberships is $15,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15000} \\]"
