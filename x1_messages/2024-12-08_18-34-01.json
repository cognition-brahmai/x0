        "content": "Let's see. So, the car is going 65 miles per hour, and we want to know how far it travels in 2 hours and 30 minutes. First, I need to make sure everything is in the same units. Hours and minutes are different, so I should convert everything to hours.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, right? So, 30 minutes is half an hour. That means 2 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 2.5 hours.\n\nNow, if the car is traveling at a constant speed of 65 miles per hour, then the distance it travels is equal to its speed multiplied by the time it's been moving. That's a basic formula in physics: distance equals speed times time, or d = s * t.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: d = 65 miles per hour * 2.5 hours.\n\nLet me do the math. 65 times 2 is 130, and 65 times 0.5 is 32.5. So, 130 plus 32.5 is 162.5 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me check again. 65 times 2.5. I can also think of it as 65 times 5 divided by 2, which is 325 divided by 2, which is indeed 162.5 miles.\n\nSo, the car will travel 162.5 miles in 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, is the speed constant? The problem says the car is traveling at 65 miles per hour, so I'm assuming it's a constant speed. If it were accelerating or decelerating, things would be different, but according to the information given, it's moving at a steady speed.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so multiplying them gives miles, which is what we want.\n\nOne more thing: sometimes, people might have different interpretations of \"traveling at 65 miles per hour.\" Does it mean exactly 65 mph, or is it an average speed? Given that it's a math problem, I think it's safe to assume it's a constant speed.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that 2 hours and 30 minutes is 2.3 hours, but that would be incorrect because 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, not 0.3 hours. That's a common mistake, so it's important to remember that 60 minutes make an hour, not 100.\n\nSo, to summarize, the car travels 162.5 miles in 2 hours and 30 minutes at a constant speed of 65 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{162.5} \\]"
