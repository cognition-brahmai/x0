        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to figure out how many trucks are required to deliver all the packages, the total distance traveled by these trucks, and the total fuel consumption. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, we have 5000 packages, each averaging 25 kg in weight. So, the total weight of all packages is:\n\nTotal weight = Number of packages \u00d7 Average weight per package\nTotal weight = 5000 \u00d7 25 kg\nTotal weight = 125,000 kg\n\nNow, each truck can carry a maximum load of 10 tons. We need to make sure we're using the same units, so let's convert tons to kilograms. I know that 1 ton is equal to 1000 kg, so:\n\nMaximum load per truck = 10 tons \u00d7 1000 kg/ton = 10,000 kg\n\nNow, to find out how many trucks are needed to carry 125,000 kg, we divide the total weight by the capacity per truck:\n\nNumber of trucks = Total weight / Maximum load per truck\nNumber of trucks = 125,000 kg / 10,000 kg/truck\nNumber of trucks = 12.5\n\nSince we can't have half a truck, we'll need to round up to the next whole number. So, we need 13 trucks to carry all the packages.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by all the trucks. The delivery routes are divided into three zones: 50 km, 100 km, and 150 km from the warehouse. However, the problem doesn't specify how many packages are going to each zone. Since we don't have that information, I'll assume that the packages are distributed equally among the three zones.\n\nSo, number of packages per zone = Total packages / Number of zones\nNumber of packages per zone = 5000 / 3 \u2248 1666.67\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a package, let's assume approximately 1667 packages per zone.\n\nNow, each truck will make a trip to one of the zones, deliver its load, and return to the warehouse. So, the round trip distance for each zone would be:\n\n- Zone 1: 50 km \u00d7 2 = 100 km\n- Zone 2: 100 km \u00d7 2 = 200 km\n- Zone 3: 150 km \u00d7 2 = 300 km\n\nNow, we need to determine how many trips each truck makes to each zone. But since we don't have information on how the packages are distributed by weight among the zones, I'll assume that the weight distribution is also equal among the zones. Therefore, each zone has approximately 1667 packages, each averaging 25 kg, so:\n\nWeight per zone = 1667 packages \u00d7 25 kg/package \u2248 41,675 kg\n\nNow, each truck can carry 10,000 kg, so the number of trips per truck per zone is:\n\nNumber of trips per truck per zone = Weight per zone / Maximum load per truck\nNumber of trips per truck per zone \u2248 41,675 kg / 10,000 kg/trip \u2248 4.167 trips\n\nSince a truck can't make a fraction of a trip, we'll need to round up to 5 trips per truck per zone.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. If each truck can carry 10,000 kg, and each zone has 41,675 kg, then the number of trips per zone is:\n\nNumber of trips per zone = Total weight per zone / Maximum load per truck\nNumber of trips per zone \u2248 41,675 kg / 10,000 kg/trip \u2248 4.167 trips\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a trip, we'll need 5 trips per zone to carry all the packages. But this seems inefficient, as 4 trips would carry 40,000 kg, and the fifth trip would carry the remaining 1,675 kg.\n\nBut here's the thing: we have 13 trucks available. So, let's see how many trips are needed in total.\n\nTotal trips needed per zone = Number of trips per zone = 5 trips\n\nSince there are three zones, total trips needed are:\n\nTotal trips = Number of zones \u00d7 Trips per zone\nTotal trips = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 trips\n\nBut we have 13 trucks available. This means that some trucks will need to make multiple trips, or perhaps some trucks are assigned to different zones.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Maybe instead of assigning specific trucks to specific zones, we can have trucks choosing any zone for their trips.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps it's better to calculate the total distance traveled by all trucks collectively, regardless of which truck goes where.\n\nSo, total distance traveled by all trucks = Number of trips \u00d7 Average round trip distance\n\nFirst, we need to find the average round trip distance. Since there are three zones with round trips of 100 km, 200 km, and 300 km, the average round trip distance is:\n\nAverage round trip distance = (100 km + 200 km + 300 km) / 3 = 600 km / 3 = 200 km\n\nNow, total trips needed are 15, as calculated earlier. Therefore, total distance traveled is:\n\nTotal distance = Total trips \u00d7 Average round trip distance\nTotal distance = 15 trips \u00d7 200 km/trip = 3,000 km\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more accurate approach would be to calculate the distance traveled per zone and then sum them up.\n\nSo, for each zone:\n\n- Zone 1: 5 trips \u00d7 100 km/trip = 500 km\n- Zone 2: 5 trips \u00d7 200 km/trip = 1,000 km\n- Zone 3: 5 trips \u00d7 300 km/trip = 1,500 km\n\nTotal distance = 500 km + 1,000 km + 1,500 km = 3,000 km\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, for fuel consumption. The fuel consumption rate is 5 km per liter of diesel. So, fuel consumption is:\n\nFuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel consumption rate\nFuel consumption = 3,000 km / 5 km/liter = 600 liters\n\nWait, but this seems too simplistic. Let's double-check the units. If the consumption is 5 km per liter, that means for every liter of diesel, the truck can travel 5 km. So, to find out how many liters are consumed for 3,000 km, we divide the total distance by the km per liter.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as:\n\nFuel consumption rate = 5 km/liter\nTherefore, fuel consumption = Total distance / (km per liter) = 3,000 km / 5 km/liter = 600 liters\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any other factors to consider. For example, is there any loading or unloading time? Are there any breaks for the drivers? However, since the problem doesn't specify any such constraints, I think calculating the distance and fuel consumption based on the trips and distances given is sufficient.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the packages are equally distributed among the three zones. If the distribution is different, the calculations would change accordingly. But since the problem doesn't provide specific distribution, this assumption seems reasonable.\n\nAdditionally, I assumed that each truck can only make one trip. But in reality, trucks can make multiple trips. However, since we have 13 trucks and need 15 trips, some trucks will need to make two trips.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I calculated that we need 15 trips in total, but we have 13 trucks. That means 13 trucks can make one trip each, and 2 trucks will need to make a second trip.\n\nLet me recalculate that.\n\nTotal trips needed: 15\nTrucks available: 13\n\nSo, 13 trucks make one trip each, accounting for 13 trips. We still need 2 more trips, so 2 trucks will need to make a second trip.\n\nTherefore, total trips made by these 2 trucks: 2 trips each, but since they've already made one trip, they'll make one additional trip each.\n\nTherefore, total distance traveled would be:\n\nDistance by 13 trucks for their first trip: 13 trucks \u00d7 average round trip distance of 200 km = 13 \u00d7 200 km = 2,600 km\n\nDistance by 2 trucks for their second trip: 2 trucks \u00d7 200 km = 400 km\n\nTotal distance: 2,600 km + 400 km = 3,000 km\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total fuel consumption remains 600 liters.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the trucks are assigned to specific zones, the calculation would be similar, but it's more complicated without knowing the exact distribution.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think this approach is acceptable.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Number of trucks required: 13 trucks\n- Total distance traveled: 3,000 km\n- Total fuel consumption: 600 liters\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13 \\text{ trucks}, 3000 \\text{ km}, 600 \\text{ liters}} \\]"
