        "content": "So I have this problem: a book has 200 pages, and each page has 250 words. I need to find out how many words are there in the whole book. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have to find the total number of words in the book. I know the number of pages and the number of words per page. So, basically, I need to multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page to get the total words.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal words = number of pages \u00d7 number of words per page\n\nNow, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal words = 200 pages \u00d7 250 words per page\n\nBefore I do the multiplication, I should make sure that the units make sense. Pages multiplied by words per page should give me words, which is what I'm looking for. So, that checks out.\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication. 200 times 250. Hmm, maybe there's an easier way to think about this. I know that 200 is 2 times 100, and 250 is 25 times 10. But maybe I can think of it differently.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 200 times 100 is 20,000. But wait, 250 is 100 plus 100 plus 50, so maybe I can break it down:\n\n200 \u00d7 100 = 20,000\n\n200 \u00d7 100 = 20,000\n\n200 \u00d7 50 = 10,000\n\nNow, add them up: 20,000 + 20,000 + 10,000 = 50,000\n\nSo, the total number of words is 50,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe I can use smaller numbers to see if my method makes sense. Suppose the book has 2 pages, each with 25 words. Then, total words would be 2 \u00d7 25 = 50 words. That seems right.\n\nScaling up, if I have 20 pages with 25 words each, that's 20 \u00d7 25 = 500 words. Still makes sense.\n\nGoing further to 200 pages with 250 words each should be 200 \u00d7 250. Well, 200 \u00d7 250 is like 2 \u00d7 25 with two zeros added, so 2 \u00d7 25 = 50, and adding three zeros makes it 50,000. Wait, that's different from what I did earlier.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check my multiplication.\n\nActually, 200 \u00d7 250:\n\n2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n\nThen, since 200 is 2 \u00d7 100, and 250 is 25 \u00d7 10, so total is 2 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 10 = 50 \u00d7 1,000 = 50,000. Okay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 200 \u00d7 250 as 200 \u00d7 200 + 200 \u00d7 50 = 40,000 + 10,000 = 50,000. Again, the same answer.\n\nSo, I think 50,000 is the correct total number of words in the book.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect the total word count. For example, are there any pages without words, like blank pages or pages with only images? The problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume all 200 pages have 250 words each.\n\nAlso, perhaps the book has a table of contents, an introduction, or an appendix with different word counts, but again, the problem specifies that each page has 250 words, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the book has any varying page counts, like if some pages have more or less words, but again, the problem states each page has 250 words, so I can assume consistency.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 50,000 words in the whole book.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50000} \\]"
