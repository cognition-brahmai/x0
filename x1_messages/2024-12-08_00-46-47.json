        "content": "So the Earth's circumference is about 24,901 miles, and I'm walking at a steady 3 miles per hour. I need to find out how many hours it would take to walk all the way around the Earth.\n\nFirst, I should probably just divide the total distance by my walking speed to get the total time. So, time equals distance divided by speed. That makes sense.\n\nSo, time = 24,901 miles / 3 miles per hour.\n\nLet me do that division. 24,901 divided by 3.\n\n3 goes into 24 eight times (3*8=24), subtract 24 from 24 gives 0. Bring down the 9, so now it's 9. 3 goes into 9 three times exactly. So, 8*1000 plus 3*100 is 8300. Now, bring down the 0, so it's 0. 3 goes into 0 zero times. Bring down the 1, so now it's 1. 3 doesn't go into 1, so that's 0.333..., but since we're dealing with miles and hours, maybe I should consider the decimal.\n\nSo, 24,901 divided by 3 is 8,300.333... hours.\n\nBut that's a lot of hours. Maybe it would be better to convert that into days and hours.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day, so to find out how many days that is, I can divide the total hours by 24.\n\nSo, days = 8,300.333... / 24.\n\nLet's do that division.\n\n24 goes into 83 three times (24*3=72), subtract 72 from 83 gives 11. Bring down the 0, so it's 110. 24 goes into 110 four times (24*4=96), subtract 96 from 110 gives 14. Bring down the 0, so it's 140. 24 goes into 140 five times (24*5=120), subtract 120 from 140 gives 20. Bring down the 0, so it's 200. 24 goes into 200 eight times (24*8=192), subtract 192 from 200 gives 8. Bring down the 3 (from 8300.333), so it's 83. 24 goes into 83 three times (24*3=72), subtract 72 from 83 gives 11. And this pattern will repeat.\n\nSo, it's approximately 345.847... days.\n\nSo, 345 days and about 0.847 of a day. To find out how many hours that is, multiply 0.847 by 24.\n\n0.847 * 24 \u2248 20.328 hours.\n\nSo, roughly 345 days and 20 hours.\n\nBut let's check if that's accurate. Maybe I should use a more precise calculation.\n\nTotal hours: 24,901 / 3 = 8,300.333... hours.\n\nTotal days: 8,300.333... / 24 = 345.847... days.\n\nDays: 345\n\nRemaining hours: 0.847 * 24 \u2248 20.328 hours.\n\nSo, approximately 345 days and 20 hours.\n\nBut to be more precise, let's consider more decimal places.\n\n24,901 / 3 = 8,300.3333... hours.\n\n8,300.3333... / 24 = 345.8472... days.\n\n0.8472 * 24 = 20.3328 hours.\n\nSo, about 20 hours and 0.328*60 minutes \u2248 19.68 minutes, which is roughly 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it would take approximately 345 days, 20 hours, and 20 minutes to walk around the Earth at 3 miles per hour.\n\nBut wait, this calculation assumes without stopping, which isn't realistic. In reality, you'd need to sleep, eat, etc., so the actual time would be longer. But since the question says \"without stopping,\" we can stick with this calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants just the total time in hours or days, without breaking it down into days and hours.\n\nTotal time in hours is approximately 8,300.333... hours.\n\nIn days, as calculated, approximately 345.847... days.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects the answer in a different format or unit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many hours per day, but the question says \"without stopping,\" so it's continuous walking.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the number of hours and then convert to days and hours.\n\nSo, 8,300 hours is 345 days and 20 hours, as previously calculated.\n\nAlternatively, to verify, 345 days * 24 hours/day = 8,280 hours.\n\nTotal hours is 8,300.333..., so 8,300.333... - 8,280 = 20.333... hours.\n\nYes, that matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 345 days, 20 hours, and 20 minutes.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects a simpler answer, like just the total hours or total days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to express it in years.\n\nThere are 365 days in a year, so 345 days is about 345/365 \u2248 0.945 years, or roughly 11.34 months.\n\nBut I think the days, hours, and minutes format is sufficient and direct.\n\nTherefore, walking around the Earth at 3 miles per hour without stopping would take approximately 345 days, 20 hours, and 20 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{345 \\text{ days}, 20 \\text{ hours}, 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
