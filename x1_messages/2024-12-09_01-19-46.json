        "content": "So I've got this problem here. I need to figure out the total distance I've traveled after driving at two different speeds for different amounts of time. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I drove at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. Then, I drove at an average speed of 80 miles per hour for another 2 hours. I need to find out the total distance I've covered.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part, it's 60 mph times 3 hours, and for the second part, it's 80 mph times 2 hours. Then, I'll add those two distances together to get the total distance.\n\nLet me do the math for the first part: 60 mph times 3 hours is 180 miles.\n\nNow, for the second part: 80 mph times 2 hours is 160 miles.\n\nNow, I'll add those two distances together: 180 miles plus 160 miles equals 340 miles.\n\nSo, the total distance traveled is 340 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe combining the speeds or something. Let's see.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the total time traveled and some sort of average speed, but that seems more complicated for this problem. Since the speeds are different for different intervals, it's easier to calculate each part separately and then add them up.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the average speed for the entire trip, I could do that by dividing the total distance by the total time. But the question is just asking for the total distance, so I don't need to go that far.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst part: 60 mph times 3 hours is indeed 180 miles.\n\nSecond part: 80 mph times 2 hours is indeed 160 miles.\n\nAdding them up: 180 plus 160 is 340 miles.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor that might affect the total distance, like acceleration or stopping times, but the problem doesn't mention any of that. It just gives average speeds for specific time periods, so using the formula distance equals speed times time should be accurate enough.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the total distance traveled is 340 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{340} \\]"
