        "content": "Sure, here's a simple JavaScript program that calculates the sum of all elements in an array:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sumArray(arr) {\n    return arr.reduce((total, current) => total + current, 0);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconsole.log(sumArray(myArray));  // Output: 15\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function called `sumArray` that takes an array as an argument. We use the `reduce` method to iterate over each element in the array, adding each element to a running total (`total`). The second argument to `reduce` is the initial value of the accumulator, which is set to 0 in this case.\n\nThen, we create an example array called `myArray` with some numbers and log the result of calling `sumArray` with this array to the console. The output should be 15, which is the sum of all the elements in the array."
