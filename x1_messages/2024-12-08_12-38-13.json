        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It's currently 15 meters long and 8 meters wide. The owner wants to increase the area by 50%. I need to figure out how much they should extend either the length or the width to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the current area of the garden is. For a rectangle, area is length times width, right? So, 15 meters times 8 meters would be 120 square meters. That's the current area.\n\nNow, the owner wants to increase this area by 50%. So, I need to calculate what 50% of 120 square meters is. 50% of 120 is 60 square meters. Therefore, the new area should be 120 plus 60, which is 180 square meters.\n\nOkay, so the target area is 180 square meters. Now, the question is, how much should they extend either the length or the width to reach this new area.\n\nLet's consider extending the length first. The width remains 8 meters, and the new length is 15 meters plus some extension, which I'll call x meters. So, the new length would be (15 + x) meters.\n\nThe new area would then be (15 + x) meters times 8 meters, which should equal 180 square meters. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n(15 + x) * 8 = 180\n\nNow, I can solve for x.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 8:\n\n15 + x = 180 / 8\n\n180 divided by 8 is 22.5\n\nSo, 15 + x = 22.5\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\nx = 22.5 - 15\n\nx = 7.5 meters\n\nSo, if they extend the length by 7.5 meters, the new length would be 15 + 7.5 = 22.5 meters, and the area would be 22.5 * 8 = 180 square meters, which is a 50% increase.\n\nNow, let's see about extending the width instead. The length remains 15 meters, and the new width is 8 meters plus some extension, which I'll call y meters. So, the new width would be (8 + y) meters.\n\nThe new area would be 15 meters times (8 + y) meters, which should equal 180 square meters. So, the equation is:\n\n15 * (8 + y) = 180\n\nAgain, solve for y.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 15:\n\n8 + y = 180 / 15\n\n180 divided by 15 is 12\n\nSo, 8 + y = 12\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\ny = 12 - 8\n\ny = 4 meters\n\nTherefore, if they extend the width by 4 meters, the new width would be 8 + 4 = 12 meters, and the area would be 15 * 12 = 180 square meters, which is also a 50% increase.\n\nSo, to achieve a 50% increase in the area, they can either extend the length by 7.5 meters or extend the width by 4 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me just double-check.\n\nOriginal area: 15 * 8 = 120 sq.m\n\nTarget area: 120 + 60 = 180 sq.m\n\nExtending length: 15 + 7.5 = 22.5 m\n\nArea: 22.5 * 8 = 180 sq.m Correct.\n\nExtending width: 8 + 4 = 12 m\n\nArea: 15 * 12 = 180 sq.m Correct.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5 \\text{ meters extension in length or } 4 \\text{ meters extension in width}} \\]"
