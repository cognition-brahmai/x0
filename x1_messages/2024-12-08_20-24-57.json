        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a garden and building a fence around it with an extra buffer. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the garden is rectangular, and it's 12 meters long and 8 meters wide. That means its length is 12 meters and its width is 8 meters. Now, I need to build a fence around it, but not right against the garden. There should be an additional 1-meter buffer on all sides.\n\nSo, that means the fence won't be right along the edges of the garden; instead, it'll be 1 meter outside the garden on every side. That makes sense for leaving some space around the garden.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I draw the garden as a rectangle, and then imagine the fence being built around it, 1 meter away from each side of the garden.\n\nSo, for the length:\n\nThe garden is 12 meters long. If I add 1 meter to each end of the length, that would be 1 meter on one end and 1 meter on the other end. So, total addition to the length is 1 + 1 = 2 meters.\n\nSimilarly, for the width:\n\nThe garden is 8 meters wide. Adding 1 meter to each side of the width, that's 1 meter on one side and 1 meter on the other side. So, total addition to the width is also 2 meters.\n\nTherefore, the fenced area's length would be the original length plus 2 meters, which is 12 + 2 = 14 meters.\n\nAnd the width would be the original width plus 2 meters, which is 8 + 2 = 10 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the buffer is 1 meter on all sides, that means it's added to both sides of the length and both sides of the width.\n\nSo, for length:\n\nOriginal length = 12 meters\n\nBuffer on one end = 1 meter\n\nBuffer on the other end = 1 meter\n\nTotal length of fenced area = 12 + 1 + 1 = 14 meters\n\nSimilarly for width:\n\nOriginal width = 8 meters\n\nBuffer on one side = 1 meter\n\nBuffer on the other side = 1 meter\n\nTotal width of fenced area = 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 meters\n\nYeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the fence being built around the garden, encompassing the garden plus the 1-meter buffer on all sides. So, effectively, the fenced area would be larger than the garden by 2 meters in length and 2 meters in width, which aligns with my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the fenced area would be 14 meters in length and 10 meters in width.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this to confirm.\n\nSuppose I consider the buffer as adding a uniform 1-meter strip around the entire garden. That would mean that on each side of the garden, the fence is 1 meter away.\n\nSo, starting from the garden:\n\nLength: 12 meters\n\nWidth: 8 meters\n\nAdding 1 meter to each side:\n\n- Left side: +1 meter\n\n- Right side: +1 meter\n\n- Front side: +1 meter\n\n- Back side: +1 meter\n\nBut since the additions on opposite sides are both 1 meter, the total addition to the length is 2 meters, and similarly for the width.\n\nTherefore, fenced length = 12 + 2 = 14 meters\n\nFenced width = 8 + 2 = 10 meters\n\nI think that's accurate.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about the area.\n\nOriginal area of the garden is 12 meters * 8 meters = 96 square meters.\n\nThe buffered area around the garden would be the area between the garden and the fence.\n\nBut I don't think I need to calculate the area to find the dimensions of the fenced area.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the fence as surrounding the garden plus the buffer, then the distance from the garden's edge to the fence is 1 meter all around.\n\nSo, to find the dimensions of the fenced area, I need to add 1 meter to each side of the length and the width.\n\nHence, length of fenced area = 12 + 2*1 = 14 meters\n\nWidth of fenced area = 8 + 2*1 = 10 meters\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider overlapping areas or anything like that, since it's a simple rectangular garden with a uniform buffer around it.\n\nSo, the final dimensions of the fenced area are 14 meters in length and 10 meters in width.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14 \\text{ meters in length and } 10 \\text{ meters in width}} \\]"
