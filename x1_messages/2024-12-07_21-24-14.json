        "content": "So, there are 4 classes in the school, and each class has 25 students. That means the total number of students is 4 classes multiplied by 25 students per class, which is 100 students.\n\nNow, every student has 5 pencils. So, to find out the total number of pencils, I need to multiply the number of students by the number of pencils each student has. That would be 100 students times 5 pencils per student.\n\nLet me do the math: 100 multiplied by 5 is 500.\n\nSo, there are 500 pencils in total.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the number of pencils per class. Since each class has 25 students and each student has 5 pencils, the number of pencils per class would be 25 students times 5 pencils, which is 125 pencils per class.\n\nThen, with 4 classes, the total number of pencils would be 4 classes times 125 pencils per class, which also gives me 500 pencils.\n\nHmm, that matches my first calculation. So, I think 500 is the correct total number of pencils.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any pencils that belong to the teachers or the school itself, but the question seems to specify that every student has 5 pencils, and it's about the students' pencils.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no students who have more or fewer pencils. The question says \"every student has 5 pencils,\" so I can assume that each student has exactly 5 pencils.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether pencils are shared among students, but the question doesn't mention anything about sharing, so I think it's safe to assume that each student has their own 5 pencils.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total number of pencils is 500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
