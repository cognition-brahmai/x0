        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 houses on one side of the street and 15 on the other, making a total of 25 houses. Each house has an even number of occupants, and I need to find the minimum total number of people living in all these houses combined.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an even number is. An even number is any integer that's divisible by 2, right? So, numbers like 0, 2, 4, 6, and so on.\n\nNow, the problem says each house has an even number of occupants. It doesn't specify that the number can't be zero, so theoretically, a house could have 0 occupants. But if I consider that a house has to have at least one occupant, then the smallest even number would be 2.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each house has an even number of occupants,\" and it doesn't mention anything about houses being unoccupied. So, it's possible that some houses have 0 occupants, but maybe in reality, houses have at least one person. However, since it's specified that the number of occupants is even, and 0 is even, I think I have to consider the possibility of 0 occupants.\n\nBut, in most contexts, a house would have at least one person. Maybe I should consider both scenarios: one where houses can have 0 occupants and one where they can't.\n\nLet me first consider the scenario where houses can have 0 occupants.\n\nIn this case, the smallest even number of occupants per house is 0. So, if all 25 houses have 0 occupants, the total number of people would be 0. But that seems too trivial and maybe not what the problem is aiming for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that houses have at least 2 occupants, since that's the smallest positive even number.\n\nLet me consider the other scenario where houses have at least 2 occupants.\n\nIn this case, each house has at least 2 occupants, and since the number has to be even, the minimum per house is 2.\n\nSo, total minimum number of people would be 25 houses * 2 occupants/house = 50 occupants.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a way to have some houses with 0 occupants and others with higher even numbers, but that might not necessarily give a smaller total than 50, unless some houses have 0 occupants.\n\nBut if I allow houses to have 0 occupants, then the minimum total would be 0, which seems too low and perhaps not realistic.\n\nMaybe the problem expects that there is at least one house with occupants, or perhaps all houses have at least some occupants.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it just says each house has an even number of occupants, without specifying a lower limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to test the understanding of even numbers and minimal sums.\n\nLet me think differently. If I have to minimize the total number of occupants, and each house has an even number of occupants, then assigning the smallest possible even number to each house would give the minimal total.\n\nAnd the smallest even number is 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total would be 0.\n\nBut perhaps the problem wants to ensure that there are occupants in all houses, meaning at least 2 per house.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's acceptable for some houses to have 0 occupants.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify any constraints beyond the number of houses and the evenness of occupants, I think the minimal total is indeed 0.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other constraints that I should be aware of.\n\nThe problem mentions that there are 10 houses on one side and 15 on the other, but doesn't specify any differences between the two sides regarding occupants.\n\nAlso, it says \"what is the minimum total number of people living in all the houses combined?\"\n\nSo, the goal is truly to find the smallest possible sum of occupants across all houses, given that each house has an even number of occupants.\n\nGiven that, and that 0 is an even number, the minimal total would be 0.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects to consider only positive even numbers, meaning at least 2 per house.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of \"even number of occupants\" \u2013 perhaps it means that the number of occupants is not odd, but it could be 0, 2, 4, etc.\n\nIn mathematics, 0 is considered an even number because it's divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n\nTherefore, if each house has 0 occupants, the total is 0, which is even, and satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, the minimal total number of people is 0.\n\nBut maybe the problem is trying to test something else, like the properties of even numbers in summation.\n\nLet me think about the sum of even numbers.\n\nThe sum of even numbers is always even.\n\nBut that doesn't help much here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to lead me to consider the parity of the total number of occupants.\n\nBut again, that doesn't change the fact that the minimal sum is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the problem statement.\n\nLet me read it again: \"In a small town, there are 10 houses on one side of the street and 15 houses on the other side. If each house has an even number of occupants, what is the minimum total number of people living in all the houses combined?\"\n\nIt seems clear: 25 houses, each with an even number of occupants, total sum to be minimized.\n\nGiven that, and that 0 is an even number, the answer should be 0.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of the problem, houses are expected to have at least one occupant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the street as a whole, and the total number of occupants must be even, but that's not what it says.\n\nIt says each house has an even number of occupants, and to find the minimal total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint on the street level, but the problem doesn't specify any such constraint.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 0.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nSuppose that the street has 10 houses on one side and 15 on the other, making 25 houses in total.\n\nEach house has an even number of occupants.\n\nThe minimal even number is 0, so assigning 0 to all houses gives a total of 0.\n\nAlternatively, if I assign 0 to 24 houses and 2 to one house, the total is 2, which is also even.\n\nBut 2 is greater than 0, so 0 is still the minimal total.\n\nAlternatively, assigning 0 to 23 houses and 2 to two houses gives a total of 4, which is again higher than 0.\n\nTherefore, 0 is indeed the minimal total.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is trying to test something else, like the minimal positive total.\n\nIn that case, the minimal positive total would be 2, with one house having 2 occupants and the rest having 0.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that the total has to be positive; it just says \"minimum total number of people.\"\n\nTherefore, including 0 is acceptable, making 0 the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to consider the sum of occupants in all houses, given that each house has at least 2 occupants.\n\nIn that case, the total would be 25 houses * 2 occupants/house = 50 occupants.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify that houses must have at least 2 occupants; only that the number of occupants is even.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total is 0.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
