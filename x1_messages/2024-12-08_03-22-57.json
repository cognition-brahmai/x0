        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (4^2 - 3) / (8 + 2 * 6). First, I need to calculate the numerator and the denominator separately, following the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 4^2 - 3.\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent: 4^2 = 16.\n\nThen subtract 3: 16 - 3 = 13.\n\nSo the numerator is 13.\n\nNow, the denominator: 8 + 2 * 6.\n\nAccording to PEMDAS, I need to do the multiplication before the addition.\n\nSo, 2 * 6 = 12.\n\nThen add 8: 8 + 12 = 20.\n\nSo the denominator is 20.\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator: 13 / 20.\n\nThat's 0.65.\n\nSo, (4^2 - 3) / (8 + 2 * 6) = 0.65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.65} \\]"
