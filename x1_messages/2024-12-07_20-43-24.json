        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have John and Sam, and John has twice as many marbles as Sam. Together, they have 45 marbles. I need to find out how many marbles each one has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to the number of marbles each person has. Let's say:\n\n- Let S represent the number of marbles Sam has.\n\n- Since John has twice as many marbles as Sam, John has 2S marbles.\n\nNow, together they have 45 marbles, so the sum of their marbles should equal 45. That gives me the equation:\n\nS + 2S = 45\n\nCombining like terms, that's:\n\n3S = 45\n\nTo find S, I need to divide both sides by 3:\n\nS = 45 / 3\n\nS = 15\n\nSo, Sam has 15 marbles. Since John has twice as many, John has:\n\n2 * 15 = 30 marbles\n\nTo check if this makes sense, I'll add them together: 15 + 30 = 45, which matches the total given. Looks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15 \\text{ marbles for Sam and } 30 \\text{ marbles for John}} \\]"
