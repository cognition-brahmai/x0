        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses on one side of the street and 15 on the other, making a total of 25 houses. Each house has an even number of people living in it. I need to figure out if the total number of people on the street has to be even.\n\nFirst, I know that even numbers are numbers like 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. One property of even numbers is that when you add two even numbers together, you get another even number. For example, 2 + 4 = 6, which is even.\n\nBut here, there are 25 houses, each with an even number of people. So, it's like adding up 25 even numbers. I need to see what happens when you add a bunch of even numbers together.\n\nLet me try with smaller numbers to see the pattern. Suppose there are 2 houses, each with 2 people: 2 + 2 = 4, which is even.\n\nIf there are 3 houses, each with 2 people: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is still even.\n\nWait, but what if the houses have different even numbers? Like one has 2, one has 4, and one has 6: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12, which is even again.\n\nOkay, seems like adding any number of even numbers always gives an even number. But wait, there's something about the number of terms in the addition.\n\nActually, no. Because even if I add an odd number of even numbers, it should still be even. Let me think about this differently.\n\nI recall that an even number can be expressed as 2 times some integer. So, if each house has an even number of people, that means for each house, the number of people is 2 multiplied by some integer.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of people in each house as 2 times some integer. For example, house 1 has 2*a people, house 2 has 2*b people, and so on, up to house 25 having 2*z people.\n\nThen, the total number of people on the street would be:\n\n2*a + 2*b + 2*c + ... + 2*z\n\nI can factor out the 2:\n\n2*(a + b + c + ... + z)\n\nSo, the total is 2 multiplied by the sum of a bunch of integers. No matter what a + b + c + ... + z equals, when you multiply it by 2, you get an even number.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people living on the street has to be an even number.\n\nWait a minute, is there any exception to this? Could there be a scenario where adding up even numbers gives an odd total?\n\nLet me think about adding zero. Zero is an even number, right? Because 0 = 2*0.\n\nSo, if some houses have zero people, that's still even. Adding zero shouldn't change the parity.\n\nAlternatively, could there be negative numbers of people? No, that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlso, the problem says each house has an even number of people living in it, so I can assume that the number of people is a non-negative integer, and even.\n\nTherefore, the total has to be even.\n\nI think that's the conclusion. The total number of people living on the street has to be an even number.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, the total number of people living on the street has to be an even number.}} \\]"
