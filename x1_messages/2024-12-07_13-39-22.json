Begin with a thought-provoking question: \"What is the smallest thing in the universe?\"\n   - Discuss students' responses and introduce the idea that quantum physics deals with the behavior of particles at the smallest scales.\n\n2. **Lecture (20 minutes):**\n   - Brief history of quantum physics: Mention key figures like Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.\n   - Explain the concept of quantization and how it differs from classical physics.\n\n3. **Interactive Activity (15 minutes):**\n   - **Quantum vs. Classical Physics Debate:**\n     - Divide the class into two groups: one representing classical physics and the other quantum physics.\n     - Each group presents key differences and real-world examples.\n     - Facilitate a short debate on which paradigm is more applicable in certain scenarios.\n\n4. **Video Presentation (5 minutes):**\n   - Show a brief video explaining the double-slit experiment to illustrate wave-particle duality.\n\n5. **Homework:**\n   - Research one real-world application of quantum physics and prepare a short presentation for the next class.\n\n##### Day 2: Wave-Particle Duality\n\n**Objective:** Understand the concept of wave-particle duality and its implications.\n\n**Activities:**\n\n1. **Review (5 minutes):**\n   - Quick quiz on key figures and basic concepts from the previous class.\n\n2. **Lecture (15 minutes):**\n   - Detailed explanation of wave-particle duality using the double-slit experiment.\n   - Introduce the uncertainty principle and its significance.\n\n3. **Interactive Simulation (15 minutes):**\n   -
