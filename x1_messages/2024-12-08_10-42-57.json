        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 20 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. We need to figure out how many handshakes that amounts to in total.\n\nFirst, I think about what's being asked. Each person is shaking hands with every other person, but not with themselves, obviously. So, for person A, they'll shake hands with persons B through T (since there are 20 people). Then, person B has already shaken hands with person A, so they only need to shake hands with persons C through T, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a classic problem in combinatorics, which is a branch of mathematics dealing with combinations and permutations. Specifically, it sounds like we're looking for the number of unique pairs that can be formed from a group of 20 people, since each handshake is a unique pair of two people.\n\nIn combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, n is 20 (the total number of people), and k is 2 (since a handshake involves two people). So, we're looking for C(20, 2).\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20 - 2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times 18!}\n\\]\n\nNow, 20! (20 factorial) is 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1, and 18! is 18 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1. So, when we divide 20! by 18!, a lot of terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20!}{18!} = 20 \u00d7 19\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \u00d7 19}{2!} = \\frac{380}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 190 unique handshakes.\n\nBut let's double-check this reasoning to make sure we haven't missed anything. Another way to think about it is to consider that each of the 20 people shakes hands with 19 others. So, initially, it might seem like there are 20 \u00d7 19 = 380 handshakes. However, this counts each handshake twice\u2014once for each participant. So, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, we need to divide by 2, which gives us 380 / 2 = 190.\n\nThis matches our earlier result, so I'm confident that 190 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to explore this a bit further, let's consider a smaller group to see if the formula works. Suppose there are 4 people in the room: A, B, C, and D. The possible handshakes are:\n\n- A shakes hands with B\n\n- A shakes hands with C\n\n- A shakes hands with D\n\n- B shakes hands with C\n\n- B shakes hands with D\n\n- C shakes hands with D\n\nThat's a total of 6 handshakes.\n\nUsing the formula C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, where n=4:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4 \u00d7 3}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nWhich matches our manual count. So, the formula holds for n=4.\n\nApplying the same logic to n=20, we get C(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \u00d7 19}{2} = 190.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 190.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
