        "content": "So we have two boxes, A and B, right? Box A has only apples, and box B has only bananas. And both boxes have the same number of fruits. I need to pick one fruit from each box without looking, and I want to find out the probability that I get an apple from box A and a banana from box B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, I'm picking one fruit from box A and one from box B. Since box A only has apples, every time I pick from box A, I'm going to get an apple. Similarly, box B only has bananas, so every time I pick from box B, I'm going to get a banana.\n\nWait a minute, does that mean that every time I pick one fruit from each box, I will always get an apple from A and a banana from B? It seems like it's a certainty, not a probability.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Probability is often used when there's uncertainty, but in this scenario, there's no uncertainty because each box contains only one type of fruit.\n\nSo, if I pick a fruit from box A, the probability of getting an apple is 1, because all fruits in box A are apples. Similarly, the probability of getting a banana from box B is 1, because all fruits in box B are bananas.\n\nNow, if I want to find the probability of both events happening together\u2014getting an apple from A and a banana from B\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event, assuming that the events are independent.\n\nIn this case, picking from box A and picking from box B are independent events because the outcome from one box doesn't affect the outcome from the other box.\n\nSo, the probability of both events happening is:\n\nProbability = Probability of apple from A \u00d7 Probability of banana from B\n\nProbability = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\nDoes that mean the probability is 1, or 100%?\n\nBut wait, probability is often expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means impossible and 1 means certain. So, probability 1 means it's certain to happen.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any chance that I could pick something other than an apple from box A? No, because box A only has apples. Similarly, is there any chance of picking something other than a banana from box B? No, because box B only has bananas.\n\nTherefore, every time I pick one fruit from each box, I will always get an apple from A and a banana from B.\n\nSo, the probability is 1, or 100%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
