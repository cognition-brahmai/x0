        "content": "Chirality in chemistry refers to molecules that are non-superposable on their mirror images, much like how our left and right hands are mirror images but not identical. This property is crucial in chemistry because it can lead to different biological activities or properties, even though the molecules have the same chemical formula and atomic connectivity.\n\nLet's dive into the options provided to understand which characteristic best describes chiral molecules.\n\nOption A suggests that chiral molecules have an axis of symmetry. An axis of symmetry means that if you rotate the molecule around that axis by a certain angle, it looks the same at least once during a full 360-degree rotation. While some chiral molecules might have axes of symmetry, this is not a defining characteristic of chirality. In fact, having an axis of symmetry doesn't prevent a molecule from being chiral, but it's not a requirement for chirality.\n\nOption B states that chiral molecules have a plane of symmetry. A plane of symmetry divides the molecule into two halves that are mirror images of each other. If a molecule has at least one plane of symmetry, it generally means that the molecule is achiral, meaning it is superposable on its mirror image. Therefore, having a plane of symmetry contradicts the definition of chirality.\n\nOption C says that chiral molecules lack an internal plane of symmetry. This aligns closely with the definition of chirality. If a molecule does not have any plane of symmetry, it cannot be superposed on its mirror image, which is the essence of being chiral.\n\nOption D proposes that chiral molecules have a center of symmetry. A center of symmetry means that for every point in the molecule, there is a corresponding point that is equidistant from the center but in the opposite direction. Molecules with a center of symmetry are also achiral because they can be superposed on their mirror images through inversion through the center.\n\nGiven these explanations, option C seems to be the correct characteristic of chiral molecules: they lack an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nHowever, to ensure completeness, let's consider option E, \"None of the above.\" Based on the analysis, option C accurately describes a key feature of chiral molecules, so option E is not necessary.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in practice, chiral molecules often contain one or more stereogenic centers, typically carbon atoms with four different substituents, known as stereocenters or chiral centers. However, the presence of a stereocenter is not always sufficient to confer chirality, and there are molecules that are chiral without having stereocenters, known as atropisomers, which have restricted rotation around a bond, leading to distinct spatial arrangements.\n\nIn summary, among the given options, the characteristic that best defines chiral molecules is that they lack an internal plane of symmetry, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
