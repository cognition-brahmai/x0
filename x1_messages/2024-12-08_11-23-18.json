        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a bee that visits 5 flowers every minute, and each flower produces 0.02 grams of nectar. We need to find out how much nectar the bee collects in an hour if it keeps working non-stop.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many flowers the bee visits in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and the bee visits 5 flowers per minute, I can calculate the total number of flowers visited in an hour by multiplying 5 flowers by 60 minutes.\n\nSo, 5 flowers/minute \u00d7 60 minutes = 300 flowers.\n\nNext, each flower produces 0.02 grams of nectar. Therefore, to find out the total nectar collected, I need to multiply the number of flowers visited by the amount of nectar per flower.\n\nThat would be 300 flowers \u00d7 0.02 grams/flower.\n\nNow, 300 \u00d7 0.02 is the same as 300 \u00d7 2/100, which is 600/100 = 6 grams.\n\nSo, the bee would collect 6 grams of nectar in an hour if it worked non-stop.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If the bee visits 5 flowers per minute and each flower has 0.02 grams of nectar, then per minute, the bee collects 5 \u00d7 0.02 = 0.1 grams of nectar.\n\nThen, over an hour, which is 60 minutes, the bee would collect 0.1 grams/minute \u00d7 60 minutes = 6 grams.\n\nYeah, that matches my first calculation. So, the answer should be 6 grams.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, does the bee take any breaks? The problem says it works non-stop, so no breaks.\n\nAlso, it assumes that each flower has exactly 0.02 grams of nectar, and the bee collects all of it. Maybe in reality, the bee might not collect all the nectar from each flower, but according to the problem, it's 0.02 grams per flower.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the flowers replenish their nectar during the hour. But the problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I think it's safe to assume that each flower visited provides 0.02 grams of nectar.\n\nSo, overall, my conclusion is that the bee collects 6 grams of nectar in an hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ grams}} \\]"
