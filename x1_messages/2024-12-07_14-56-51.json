The major and minor scales consist of five pitches each.\n\nC. The concept of tonality is based on the relationship of all pitches to a home pitch or tonic.\n\nD. Tonality is a concept exclusive to Eastern music.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The passage says that tonality is a central organizing principle of Western music that emerged during the Baroque period. It's based on the perception of a home pitch, or tonic, to which all other pitches are related. This is often established through a specific pattern of pitches known as a scale, and the major and minor scales consist of seven pitches each.\n\nSo, option A says that tonality was abandoned after the Baroque period. But the passage says it emerged during the Baroque period and is a central organizing principle of Western music. Doesn't sound like it was abandoned. Maybe it evolved or changed, but it wasn't abandoned. So, A seems unlikely.\n\nOption B says that major and minor scales consist of five pitches each. But the passage clearly states that they consist of seven pitches each. So, B is incorrect.\n\nOption C says that the concept of tonality is based on the relationship of all pitches to a home pitch or tonic. That matches exactly with what the passage says: \"It is based on the perception of a home pitch, or tonic, to which all other pitches are related.\" So, C seems correct.\n\nOption D says that tonality is a concept exclusive to Eastern music. But the passage clearly states that tonality is a central organizing principle of Western music, not Eastern music. So, D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely true statement based on the information provided is option C: The concept of tonality is based on the relationship of all pitches to a home pitch or tonic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
