        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and each widget needs 10 minutes of labor from one worker. The factory operates for 8 hours each day. I need to find out how many workers are needed to meet this daily production quota.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total labor time required for producing 1000 widgets. Since each widget takes 10 minutes, I can multiply the number of widgets by the time per widget:\n\n1000 widgets * 10 minutes/widget = 10,000 minutes\n\nSo, the total labor time needed is 10,000 minutes.\n\nNext, I need to know how much time each worker can contribute in a day. The factory operates for 8 hours per day. I should convert these hours into minutes because the labor time is in minutes.\n\n8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes per day per worker\n\nNow, I have the total labor time required (10,000 minutes) and the labor time each worker can provide per day (480 minutes). To find out the number of workers needed, I can divide the total labor time by the labor time per worker:\n\n10,000 minutes / 480 minutes/worker = 20.8333 workers\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a worker, I'll need to round up to the next whole number. So, the factory needs 21 workers to meet the daily production quota.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- Total widgets: 1000\n\n- Time per widget: 10 minutes\n\n- Total labor time: 1000 * 10 = 10,000 minutes\n\n- Factory operating time per day: 8 hours\n\n- Convert operating time to minutes: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes\n\n- Number of workers needed: 10,000 / 480 \u2248 20.8333\n\n- Rounding up: 21 workers\n\nSeems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate how many widgets one worker can produce in a day and then determine how many workers are needed to reach 1000 widgets.\n\nFirst, find out how many minutes a worker works in a day: 480 minutes.\n\nEach widget takes 10 minutes, so one worker can produce:\n\n480 minutes / 10 minutes/widget = 48 widgets per day\n\nNow, to produce 1000 widgets, the number of workers needed would be:\n\n1000 widgets / 48 widgets/worker \u2248 20.8333 workers\n\nAgain, rounding up to 21 workers.\n\nThis matches the previous calculation, so I'm more confident now.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there any breaks or downtime that might reduce the effective working time of each worker? The problem doesn't mention anything about breaks, so I'll assume that the 8 hours are fully productive.\n\nAlso, I've assumed that all workers work at the same rate and that there are no inefficiencies in the production process. Again, since the problem doesn't provide additional information, this seems fair.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the tasks can be parallelized. Since each widget requires 10 minutes of labor from one worker, and the factory has multiple workers, they can work on different widgets simultaneously.\n\nSo, with 21 workers, each working for 480 minutes, the total labor time available is:\n\n21 workers * 480 minutes/worker = 10,080 minutes\n\nThe required labor time is 10,000 minutes, so 10,080 minutes is sufficient to cover the 10,000 minutes needed.\n\nIf we had only 20 workers, the total labor time would be:\n\n20 workers * 480 minutes/worker = 9,600 minutes\n\nWhich is less than 10,000 minutes, so 20 workers wouldn't be enough.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs 21 workers to meet the daily production quota.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
