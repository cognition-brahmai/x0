        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a train traveling between two cities. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nFirst, the train travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours to go between the two cities. So, I can figure out the distance between the cities using the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, distance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow, the question is, if the train traveled at an average speed of 80 miles per hour, how long would it take to travel the same distance?\n\nSo, I need to find the time it takes to travel 120 miles at 80 miles per hour.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nTime = Distance \u00f7 Speed\n\nTime = 120 miles \u00f7 80 miles/hour = 1.5 hours.\n\nSo, it would take 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour.\n\nBut let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of proportions. If the speed increases, the time should decrease proportionally.\n\nSo, the original speed is 60 mph, and the new speed is 80 mph.\n\nThe ratio of the speeds is 60:80, which simplifies to 3:4.\n\nSince time is inversely proportional to speed when distance is constant, the ratio of times should be 4:3.\n\nOriginal time is 2 hours, so new time should be (3/4) \u00d7 2 hours = 1.5 hours.\n\nYeah, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nWe already found the distance is 120 miles, and the new speed is 80 mph.\n\nSo, Time = 120 / 80 = 1.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't calculate the distance first, I could set up a proportion.\n\nLet\u2019s say t is the new time.\n\nThen, since distance is the same:\n\nOriginal speed \u00d7 original time = new speed \u00d7 new time\n\nSo, 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 80 mph \u00d7 t\n\n120 = 80t\n\nt = 120 / 80 = 1.5 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that the answer is 1.5 hours.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any acceleration or stopping time involved? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume constant speed.\n\nAlso, the train is traveling between two cities, so maybe there are some stops in between, but again, the problem doesn't specify, and it gives average speeds, so I think we can proceed with the calculations we've already done.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 1.5 hours.\n\nWait, but maybe I should express it in hours and minutes for better understanding.\n\n1.5 hours is equal to 1 hour and 0.5 hours.\n\nSince 0.5 hours is 30 minutes, the total time is 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nSo, it would take 1 hour and 30 minutes to travel between the same two cities at an average speed of 80 miles per hour.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me just confirm the units.\n\nSpeed is in miles per hour, time is in hours, so everything matches up.\n\nNo conversion issues here.\n\nI think this is straightforward.\n\nSometimes these problems can have tricks, like different speeds for different parts of the journey, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer is 1.5 hours or 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
