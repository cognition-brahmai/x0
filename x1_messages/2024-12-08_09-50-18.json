        "content": "So I have this investment problem here. I need to figure out how much $10,000 will grow to after 3 years with an annual interest rate of 4%, and it's compounded quarterly. Hmm, I remember something about compound interest, but I need to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like A equals P times (1 plus r over n) to the power of n times t. Let me write that down:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t)\n\nOkay, so in this formula:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money. In this case, it's $10,000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate decimal. The rate is 4%, so r would be 0.04.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded quarterly, n should be 4.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years. Here, it's 3 years.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3)\n\nLet me calculate step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per period:\n\n0.04 divided by 4 is 0.01.\n\nSo, 1 plus 0.01 is 1.01.\n\nNext, raise 1.01 to the power of 4 times 3, which is 12.\n\nSo, 1.01 to the power of 12.\n\nI need to calculate 1.01^12.\n\nLet me see, 1.01 to the power of 12 is approximately 1.126825.\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal amount:\n\n10000 * 1.126825 = 11268.25.\n\nSo, after 3 years, the investment would be worth $11,268.25.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the formula seems correct: A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t).\n\nValues:\n\nP = 10,000\n\nr = 0.04\n\nn = 4 (since it's compounded quarterly)\n\nt = 3\n\nPlugging in:\n\nA = 10,000 * (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3) = 10,000 * (1 + 0.01)^12 = 10,000 * (1.01)^12.\n\nNow, calculating (1.01)^12.\n\nLet me calculate it step by step:\n\n1.01^1 = 1.01\n\n1.01^2 = 1.0201\n\n1.01^3 = 1.030301\n\n1.01^4 = 1.04060401\n\n1.01^5 = 1.0510100501\n\n1.01^6 = 1.061520150601\n\n1.01^7 = 1.07213535210701\n\n1.01^8 = 1.0828567056280801\n\n1.01^9 = 1.0936852726843609\n\n1.01^10 = 1.1046221254112045\n\n1.01^11 = 1.1156683466653165\n\n1.01^12 = 1.1268250299999697\n\nSo, approximately 1.126825.\n\nNow, multiply by P:\n\n10,000 * 1.126825 = 11,268.25.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the compound interest formula in a financial calculator or use logarithms, but this step-by-step multiplication is straightforward.\n\nSo, the investment will be worth $11,268.25 after 3 years.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the interest earned each quarter and add it to the principal sequentially.\n\nStarting with $10,000.\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = principal * quarterly rate = 10,000 * 0.01 = 100.\n\nNew principal = 10,000 + 100 = 10,100.\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = 10,100 * 0.01 = 101.\n\nNew principal = 10,100 + 101 = 10,201.\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = 10,201 * 0.01 = 102.01.\n\nNew principal = 10,201 + 102.01 = 10,303.01.\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = 10,303.01 * 0.01 = 103.0301.\n\nNew principal = 10,303.01 + 103.0301 = 10,406.0401.\n\nYear 1 end: $10,406.04.\n\nYear 2:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = 10,406.04 * 0.01 = 104.0604.\n\nNew principal = 10,406.04 + 104.0604 = 10,510.1004.\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = 10,510.1004 * 0.01 = 105.101004.\n\nNew principal = 10,510.1004 + 105.101004 = 10,615.201404.\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = 10,615.201404 * 0.01 = 106.15201404.\n\nNew principal = 10,615.201404 + 106.15201404 = 10,721.35341804.\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = 10,721.35341804 * 0.01 = 107.2135341804.\n\nNew principal = 10,721.35341804 + 107.2135341804 = 10,828.5669522204.\n\nYear 2 end: $10,828.57.\n\nYear 3:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = 10,828.5669522204 * 0.01 = 108.285669522204.\n\nNew principal = 10,828.5669522204 + 108.285669522204 = 10,936.8526217426.\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = 10,936.8526217426 * 0.01 = 109.368526217426.\n\nNew principal = 10,936.8526217426 + 109.368526217426 = 11,046.22114796.\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = 11,046.22114796 * 0.01 = 110.4622114796.\n\nNew principal = 11,046.22114796 + 110.4622114796 = 11,156.6833594396.\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = 11,156.6833594396 * 0.01 = 111.566833594396.\n\nNew principal = 11,156.6833594396 + 111.566833594396 = 11,268.250193034.\n\nAfter 3 years, the investment is worth approximately $11,268.25, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is the same.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, I should also note that if the interest was compounded annually, semi-annually, monthly, or continuously, the final amount would be different.\n\nBut in this case, it's specifically compounded quarterly.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the interest rate is an annual rate of 4%, compounded quarterly, which means each quarter, the interest rate is 1% (since 4% divided by 4 is 1%).\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the periodic interest rate is 1% every quarter.\n\nOver 3 years, there are 12 quarters (3 years times 4 quarters per year), so the investment grows by 1% each quarter, compounded.\n\nSo, starting with $10,000, after each quarter, the amount is multiplied by 1.01.\n\nAfter 12 quarters, it's multiplied by 1.01^12, which is approximately 1.126825, leading to $11,268.25.\n\nAlternatively, if the interest was simple interest, the calculation would be different.\n\nSimple interest is calculated as:\n\nA = P(1 + r*t)\n\nSo, A = 10,000(1 + 0.04*3) = 10,000(1 + 0.12) = 10,000*1.12 = $11,200.\n\nBut in this case, since it's compounded quarterly, the amount is higher due to the compounding effect.\n\nThe difference between compound and simple interest in this scenario is $11,268.25 - $11,200 = $68.25.\n\nThis demonstrates the power of compound interest over time.\n\nIn summary, after 3 years, with an annual interest rate of 4% compounded quarterly, an initial investment of $10,000 will grow to $11,268.25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11268.25} \\]"
