        "content": "The iconic Hollywood sign, which originally read 'Hollywoodland,' is located in the city of Los Angeles, California, in the United States. The sign was erected in 1923 to advertise a housing development called Hollywoodland, which was situated on the slopes of Mount Lee in the Hollywood Hills. Over the years, the sign became synonymous with the American film industry and the city of Los Angeles, eventually losing the last four letters ('land') in 1949 when the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce reinforced and replanted the letters to spell just \"Hollywood.\" Today, it stands as a famous landmark and symbol of the entertainment industry."
