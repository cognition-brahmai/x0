        "content": "So I have this problem here: a book has 200 pages, and I read 20 pages per day, but I skip reading every third day. I need to figure out how long it will take to finish the book. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the reading pattern. I read 20 pages most days, but every third day, I take a break and don't read at all. So, it's like a cycle: read, read, skip; read, read, skip; and so on.\n\nMaybe I can think in terms of cycles. Each cycle consists of three days: two days of reading and one day of skipping. So, in each cycle, I read 20 pages on the first day and 20 pages on the second day, totaling 40 pages per cycle.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many such cycles it will take to read 200 pages.\n\nLet me calculate the number of cycles required:\n\nTotal pages to read: 200\n\nPages per cycle: 40\n\nNumber of cycles: 200 / 40 = 5 cycles.\n\nSince each cycle is three days, the total time would be 5 cycles * 3 days/cycle = 15 days.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to check if this makes sense. Let's verify.\n\nIn 5 cycles:\n\n- Cycle 1: Day 1 (20 pages), Day 2 (20 pages), Day 3 (0 pages) \u2192 Total 40 pages\n\n- Cycle 2: Day 4 (20 pages), Day 5 (20 pages), Day 6 (0 pages) \u2192 Total 40 pages\n\n- Cycle 3: Day 7 (20 pages), Day 8 (20 pages), Day 9 (0 pages) \u2192 Total 40 pages\n\n- Cycle 4: Day 10 (20 pages), Day 11 (20 pages), Day 12 (0 pages) \u2192 Total 40 pages\n\n- Cycle 5: Day 13 (20 pages), Day 14 (20 pages), Day 15 (0 pages) \u2192 Total 40 pages\n\nTotal pages read: 5 * 40 = 200 pages.\n\nSo, it seems like in 15 days, I would finish the book.\n\nBut let's consider if there's a more precise way to look at it. Maybe there's a formula or a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to think about the average number of pages read per day.\n\nNormally, I read 20 pages per day, but I skip every third day. So, over three days, I read on two days: 20 pages each day, totaling 40 pages in three days.\n\nTherefore, the average pages per day is 40 pages / 3 days \u2248 13.33 pages per day.\n\nNow, to read 200 pages at an average of 13.33 pages per day, the time required would be:\n\nTime = Total pages / Average pages per day = 200 / (40/3) = 200 * (3/40) = 15 days.\n\nAgain, I get 15 days.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the reading pattern in terms of arithmetic sequences or something, but I think the cycle approach is straightforward and makes sense.\n\nWait, but I should consider if the number of pages doesn't divide evenly into the cycles.\n\nIn this case, 200 pages divided by 40 pages per cycle equals exactly 5 cycles, so it works out perfectly.\n\nBut what if the total pages were, say, 210 pages? Then, 210 / 40 = 5.25 cycles. Since I can't have a fraction of a cycle, I would need to round up to 6 cycles, which would be 18 days.\n\nBut in that case, in 5 cycles, I would have read 200 pages, and in the sixth cycle, I would read another 40 pages, but since I only need 10 more pages, I would actually finish on the first day of the sixth cycle.\n\nSo, in that scenario, it would take less than 18 days.\n\nBut in our case, since 200 is exactly 5 cycles, it's straightforward: 15 days.\n\nI think the answer is 15 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
