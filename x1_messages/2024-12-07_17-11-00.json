        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual operating budget of $2,400,000. They allocate 25% to employee salaries and 15% to marketing expenses. I need to find out how much is left for other expenses.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much is allocated to employee salaries. That's 25% of $2,400,000. To find that, I can multiply 2,400,000 by 0.25.\n\n2,400,000 * 0.25 = 600,000\n\nSo, $600,000 is allocated to employee salaries.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the marketing expenses, which are 15% of the budget. So, 15% of $2,400,000 is:\n\n2,400,000 * 0.15 = 360,000\n\nTherefore, $360,000 is allocated to marketing expenses.\n\nNow, to find out how much is left for other expenses, I need to subtract the sums allocated to salaries and marketing from the total budget.\n\nTotal budget: $2,400,000\n\nSalaries: $600,000\n\nMarketing: $360,000\n\nSo, other expenses = total budget - salaries - marketing\n\nOther expenses = 2,400,000 - 600,000 - 360,000\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n2,400,000 - 600,000 = 1,800,000\n\n1,800,000 - 360,000 = 1,440,000\n\nTherefore, the company has $1,440,000 left for other expenses.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to approach this. Instead of calculating each allocation separately and then subtracting, perhaps I can find the percentage allocated to other expenses first and then calculate that percentage of the total budget.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTotal percentage allocated to salaries and marketing is 25% + 15% = 40%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage left for other expenses is 100% - 40% = 60%.\n\nNow, 60% of the total budget is:\n\n2,400,000 * 0.60 = 1,440,000\n\nSo, again, $1,440,000 is left for other expenses.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. It looks like $1,440,000 is the amount available for other expenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1440000} \\]"
