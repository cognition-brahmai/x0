I mean, who wouldn't want to fly around, save the world, and have a sweet set of spandex to show off? But in all seriousness, if I had to pick something a bit more grounded\u2014though still totally awesome\u2014it would be the world's greatest wingman. Helping guys like Ted Mosby navigate the complexities of the dating world, making sure they always look good, feel good, and, most importantly, get the girl. Or guy, whichever floats their boat. Because in this modern era, love knows no bounds, and neither should a professional wingman. So, yeah, that's my dream job: the ultimate relationship guru, the go-to guy for all things love and connections. And maybe, just maybe, I'll write a book about it one day, something like \"How I Met Everybody's Mother.\" Now that would be a bestseller. So, suit up, world, because here I come!\n"
