        "content": "So I have this problem here: a spherical balloon has a volume of 36\u03c0 cubic inches, and I need to find its radius. Okay, I remember that the volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = 4/3 \u03c0 r\u00b3, where V is the volume and r is the radius. So, I have V = 36\u03c0, and I need to solve for r.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nV = 4/3 \u03c0 r\u00b3\n\n36\u03c0 = 4/3 \u03c0 r\u00b3\n\nHmm, okay. First, I can probably simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \u03c0. That should make it a bit easier.\n\nSo, 36\u03c0 / \u03c0 = 4/3 r\u00b3\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n36 = 4/3 r\u00b3\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for r\u00b3. I can do that by multiplying both sides by 3/4 to isolate r\u00b3.\n\n36 * (3/4) = r\u00b3\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n36 * 3 = 108\n\n108 / 4 = 27\n\nSo, r\u00b3 = 27\n\nNow, to find r, I need to take the cube root of both sides.\n\nr = \u00b3\u221a27\n\nI know that 3\u00b3 = 27, so r = 3\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nIf r = 3, then V = 4/3 \u03c0 (3)\u00b3 = 4/3 \u03c0 * 27 = 4/3 * 27 \u03c0 = 36\u03c0\n\nYes, that matches the given volume. So, the radius is 3 inches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other possible solution. Since the radius can't be negative\u2014it's a physical measurement\u2014r = 3 is the only valid solution.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's go through it again.\n\nStarting with V = 4/3 \u03c0 r\u00b3\n\nSet V = 36\u03c0\n\nSo, 36\u03c0 = 4/3 \u03c0 r\u00b3\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0: 36 = 4/3 r\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/4: r\u00b3 = 27\n\nCube root of 27 is 3.\n\nSeems solid. No mistakes there.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the volume of a sphere and plug in r = 3 to verify.\n\nV = 4/3 \u03c0 (3)^3 = 4/3 \u03c0 * 27 = 4*27/3 \u03c0 = 108/3 \u03c0 = 36\u03c0\n\nYes, that matches the given volume.\n\nI think that's it. The radius of the spherical balloon is 3 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
