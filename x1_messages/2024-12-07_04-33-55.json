        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 10 feet and a height of 15 feet. Water is being pumped into it at a rate of 4 cubic feet per minute, and I need to find out how long it will take to fill the tank completely.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the volume of the tank because that will tell me how much water it can hold. Since the tank is cylindrical, I can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nI know the diameter is 10 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is 5 feet. The height is 15 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\nV = \u03c0*(5)\u00b2*(15)\n\nLet me calculate that. 5 squared is 25, and 25 times 15 is 375. So, V = 375\u03c0 cubic feet.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it will take to fill this volume at a rate of 4 cubic feet per minute. To find the time, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Volume / Rate\n\nSo, Time = 375\u03c0 / 4 minutes.\n\nBut I want to have a numerical value here. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so let's multiply 375 by 3.1416.\n\n375 * 3.1416 = let's see, 375 times 3 is 1125, 375 times 0.14 is 52.5, and 375 times 0.0016 is 0.6. So altogether, that's approximately 1125 + 52.5 + 0.6 = 1178.1 cubic feet.\n\nNow, divide that by 4 cubic feet per minute:\n\nTime = 1178.1 / 4 = 294.525 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should be more precise with my calculation. Let me recalculate the volume more accurately.\n\nVolume = \u03c0*(5)^2*(15) = \u03c0*25*15 = 375\u03c0 cubic feet.\n\nNow, Time = 375\u03c0 / 4 minutes.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535,\n\nVolume \u2248 375 * 3.1415926535 = 1178.097 cubic feet.\n\nThen, Time = 1178.097 / 4 = 294.52425 minutes.\n\nThat's quite precise, but maybe I can leave it in terms of \u03c0 for exactness.\n\nTime = 375\u03c0 / 4 minutes = (375/4)\u03c0 minutes = 93.75\u03c0 minutes.\n\nSince \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, 93.75 * 3.1416 = 93.75 * 3.1416.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n93.75 * 3 = 281.25\n\n93.75 * 0.14 = 13.125\n\n93.75 * 0.0016 = approximately 0.15.\n\nSo, 281.25 + 13.125 + 0.15 = 294.525 minutes.\n\nAlright, so approximately 294.525 minutes. But maybe I can convert this into hours and minutes to make more sense.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\nHours = 294.525 / 60 \u2248 4.90875 hours.\n\nWhich is 4 hours and 0.90875*60 minutes \u2248 4 hours and 54.525 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 4 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should check my calculations again to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me double-check the volume calculation.\n\nVolume of a cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nRadius r = 5 feet, height h = 15 feet.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0*(5)^2*(15) = \u03c0*25*15 = 375\u03c0 cubic feet.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, filling rate is 4 cubic feet per minute.\n\nTime = Volume / Rate = 375\u03c0 / 4 minutes.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, 375*3.1416 = 1178.1 cubic feet.\n\nTime = 1178.1 / 4 = 294.525 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, 375\u03c0 / 4 = 93.75\u03c0 minutes.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, 93.75*3.1416 \u2248 294.525 minutes.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nConverting to hours and minutes:\n\n294.525 minutes / 60 = 4.90875 hours.\n\nInteger part is 4 hours.\n\nDecimal part is 0.90875 hours * 60 minutes = approximately 54.525 minutes.\n\nSo, total time is about 4 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours and } 55 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
