        "content": "So the city wants to upgrade its public transportation by adding electric buses. They currently have 100 diesel buses, each carrying 50 passengers. The new electric buses can carry 60 passengers each and cost $500,000 apiece. The budget for this project is $25 million. We need to find out how many electric buses they can buy with that budget, the total passenger capacity after the upgrade, and the percentage increase in passenger capacity compared to the current fleet.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many electric buses they can purchase with $25 million. Each electric bus costs $500,000, so we divide the total budget by the cost per bus:\n\nNumber of electric buses = $25,000,000 / $500,000 = 50 buses\n\nSo, they can buy 50 electric buses.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total passenger capacity of the upgraded fleet. The current fleet has 100 diesel buses, each with a capacity of 50 passengers, so:\n\nCurrent total capacity = 100 buses * 50 passengers/bus = 5,000 passengers\n\nThe new electric buses have a capacity of 60 passengers each, so for 50 buses:\n\nNew total capacity from electric buses = 50 buses * 60 passengers/bus = 3,000 passengers\n\nAssuming they replace some of the diesel buses with electric ones, we need to know how many diesel buses will remain. If they buy 50 electric buses, and they originally had 100 diesel buses, they could replace 50 diesel buses with electric ones, leaving them with 50 diesel buses still in service.\n\nSo, the total passenger capacity after the upgrade would be:\n\nPassenger capacity from remaining diesel buses = 50 buses * 50 passengers/bus = 2,500 passengers\n\nPassenger capacity from electric buses = 50 buses * 60 passengers/bus = 3,000 passengers\n\nTotal passenger capacity = 2,500 + 3,000 = 5,500 passengers\n\nAlternatively, if they add the 50 electric buses to the existing 100 diesel buses, the total number of buses would be 150, with:\n\nTotal passenger capacity = (100 buses * 50 passengers/bus) + (50 buses * 60 passengers/bus) = 5,000 + 3,000 = 8,000 passengers\n\nBut the problem says \"adding electric buses to its fleet,\" which suggests they are not replacing the diesel buses but adding to the existing fleet. So, the total passenger capacity would be 8,000 passengers.\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage increase in passenger capacity.\n\nFirst, we need to know the initial and final capacities.\n\nInitial capacity = 100 buses * 50 passengers/bus = 5,000 passengers\n\nFinal capacity = 150 buses with a total capacity of 8,000 passengers\n\nPercentage increase = [(final capacity - initial capacity) / initial capacity] * 100%\n\nPercentage increase = [(8,000 - 5,000) / 5,000] * 100% = (3,000 / 5,000) * 100% = 0.6 * 100% = 60%\n\nSo, the passenger capacity increases by 60%.\n\nWait a minute, but in the earlier step, I assumed they add the electric buses to the existing fleet, bringing the total to 150 buses. But perhaps they are replacing some of the diesel buses with electric ones.\n\nLet me check the problem again. It says \"adding electric buses to its fleet.\" This suggests that they are expanding the fleet by adding electric buses, not necessarily replacing the existing ones.\n\nTherefore, with a budget of $25 million and each electric bus costing $500,000, they can buy 50 electric buses, as calculated earlier.\n\nIf they add these 50 electric buses to the existing 100 diesel buses, the total number of buses becomes 150.\n\nThe total passenger capacity would be:\n\nPassengers from diesel buses: 100 buses * 50 passengers/bus = 5,000 passengers\n\nPassengers from electric buses: 50 buses * 60 passengers/bus = 3,000 passengers\n\nTotal passenger capacity: 5,000 + 3,000 = 8,000 passengers\n\nThe initial passenger capacity with only diesel buses was 100 * 50 = 5,000 passengers.\n\nThe increase in passenger capacity is 8,000 - 5,000 = 3,000 passengers.\n\nThe percentage increase is (3,000 / 5,000) * 100% = 60%.\n\nSo, the maximum number of electric buses they can purchase is 50, the total passenger capacity of the upgraded fleet is 8,000 passengers, and the percentage increase in passenger capacity is 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe maximum number of electric buses that can be purchased is \\boxed{50}, the total passenger capacity of the upgraded fleet is \\boxed{8000} passengers, and the percentage increase in passenger capacity is \\boxed{60\\%}."
