        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here: flipping three coins and trying to find out the probability that exactly two of them come up heads. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on when I flip three coins. Each coin has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). So, for three coins, the total number of possible outcomes should be 2 multiplied by itself three times, right? Because each coin is independent of the others. So, 2^3 equals 8 possible outcomes. Let me list them out to make sure:\n\n1. HHH\n\n2. HHT\n\n3. HTH\n\n4. HTT\n\n5. THH\n\n6. THT\n\n7. TTH\n\n8. TTT\n\nOkay, so there are indeed eight possible ways the three coins can land.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of outcomes where exactly two coins come up heads. Let's look at the list:\n\n1. HHH - that's three heads, not two.\n\n2. HHT - that's two heads and one tail.\n\n3. HTH - that's also two heads and one tail.\n\n4. HTT - that's one head and two tails.\n\n5. THH - two heads and one tail.\n\n6. THT - one head and two tails.\n\n7. TTH - one head and two tails.\n\n8. TTT - no heads.\n\nSo, from this list, the outcomes with exactly two heads are HHT, HTH, and THH. That's three outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 3 divided by 8.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using combinations? Because order shouldn't matter here, right? I just need to know how many ways to choose 2 heads out of 3 coins.\n\nThe combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, in this case, n = 3 (coins), and k = 2 (heads). So, C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3 - 2)!) = (6) / (2 * 1) = 3.\n\nSo, there are 3 ways to choose which two coins come up heads. And again, with 8 total possible outcomes, the probability is 3/8.\n\nHmm, that matches what I got earlier by listing out the outcomes. Good, that makes sense.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance that order matters here? For example, does HHT count differently than HTH? Well, in probability with coins, each sequence is equally likely, so order does matter in that sense. Each of the 8 outcomes is equally probable.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider only the number of heads, then order wouldn't matter, but in this case, since each sequence is equally likely, it's fine to count them as distinct outcomes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability of each specific outcome. Since each coin flip is independent, and assuming fair coins, each outcome has a probability of (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nSo, for the three outcomes that have exactly two heads (HHT, HTH, THH), each has a probability of 1/8. Therefore, the total probability is 3 * (1/8) = 3/8.\n\nWait, but let's say I didn't list out all the outcomes. Is there a formula I can use directly?\n\nYes, in probability, the number of ways to get exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n independent Bernoulli trials (coin flips) is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C(n, k) is the combination formula, which gives the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials.\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (for a fair coin, p = 1/2).\n\n- (1 - p) is the probability of failure (tails, in this case).\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nn = 3 (coins)\n\nk = 2 (heads)\n\np = 1/2\n\nP(X = 2) = C(3, 2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^(3 - 2) = 3 * (1/4) * (1/2) = 3 * (1/8) = 3/8\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using probability trees or something like that?\n\nWell, a probability tree would work, but with three coins, it might get a bit cumbersome. Let's see:\n\nFirst coin: heads (1/2) or tails (1/2)\n\nSecond coin: heads (1/2) or tails (1/2)\n\nThird coin: heads (1/2) or tails (1/2)\n\nTo get exactly two heads, I need to consider the paths where there are two heads and one tail.\n\nSo, possible paths:\n\n1. HHT: (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8\n\n2. HTH: 1/8\n\n3. THH: 1/8\n\nAgain, adding them up gives 3/8.\n\nAlright, so no matter which way I approach this, I keep getting 3/8 as the probability.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance I'm missing something. For example, could HHH be considered as having exactly two heads? No, it has three heads, which is more than two.\n\nWhat about outcomes with only one head, like HTT, THT, TTH? Those have only one head, which is less than two.\n\nAnd TTT has no heads.\n\nSo, only HHT, HTH, and THH have exactly two heads.\n\nIs there any overlapping or anything like that? No, these are distinct outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of binary sequences. Each coin flip is a binary digit: H = 1, T = 0.\n\nSo, three coins correspond to three binary digits, ranging from 000 to 111.\n\nWe're interested in sequences with exactly two 1's.\n\nSo, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.\n\nOut of these, 011, 101, and 110 have exactly two 1's, which correspond to HHT, HTH, and THH.\n\nAgain, three out of eight sequences meet the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3/8.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if the coins are indistinct. Does that change anything?\n\nIf the coins are indistinct, meaning we don't care about the order, then we're dealing with multiset probabilities.\n\nBut in probability theory, when dealing with coin flips, it's standard to consider each sequence as equally likely, even if the coins are identical.\n\nSo, I think sticking with the 3/8 probability is correct.\n\nIs there any chance that the answer could be different if the coins are biased?\n\nWell, the problem specifies \"fair coins,\" I assume, since it doesn't mention any bias. If the coins were biased, say, with a probability p of landing heads, then the formula would involve p.\n\nBut in this case, with fair coins, p = 1/2, and we've already used that in our calculations.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The probability of getting exactly two heads when flipping three fair coins is 3/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}} \\]"
