        "content": "So I've got this function here: y = (2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9)^4, and I need to find its derivative using the chain rule. I'm a bit rusty on the chain rule, but I remember that it's used when you have a composite function, meaning one function inside another. In this case, the inside function is 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9, and it's raised to the fourth power outside.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the chain rule. The chain rule says that if you have a composite function, say y = f(g(x)), then the derivative dy/dx is f'(g(x)) * g'(x). So, in this case, f(u) = u^4, where u = g(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9.\n\nSo, I need to find f'(u) and g'(x), then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, let's find f'(u). Since f(u) = u^4, its derivative is f'(u) = 4u^3.\n\nNext, let's find g'(x). g(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9. To find g'(x), I'll differentiate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe derivative of 2x^3 is 6x^2.\n\nThe derivative of -5x^2 is -10x.\n\nThe derivative of 7x is 7.\n\nThe derivative of -9 is 0.\n\nSo, g'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 7.\n\nNow, according to the chain rule, dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nWe have f'(u) = 4u^3, and u = g(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9, so f'(g(x)) = 4(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9)^3.\n\nAnd g'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 7.\n\nTherefore, dy/dx = 4(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9)^3 * (6x^2 - 10x + 7).\n\nI think that's the derivative. Maybe I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, identifying the outer function as u^4 and the inner function as 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9 seems correct.\n\nThen, finding the derivative of the outer function with respect to u is 4u^3, which is right.\n\nNext, finding the derivative of the inner function with respect to x: 6x^2 - 10x + 7, that looks correct too.\n\nFinally, multiplying them together: 4(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9)^3 * (6x^2 - 10x + 7), that seems to follow the chain rule properly.\n\nI don't think I missed anything. Maybe I can try plugging in a value for x to test it, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can see if there's a way to simplify the expression, but it already looks pretty simplified to me.\n\nSo, I think the derivative of y = (2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9)^4 is dy/dx = 4(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9)^3 * (6x^2 - 10x + 7).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 9)^3(6x^2 - 10x + 7)} \\]"
