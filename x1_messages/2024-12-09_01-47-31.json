Here's a Python function that calculates the sum of squares of all numbers in a list:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    return sum(num ** 2 for num in numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers_list)\nprint(result)  # Output: 55\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input and uses a generator expression to square each number, then sums them up using the built-in `sum()` function."
