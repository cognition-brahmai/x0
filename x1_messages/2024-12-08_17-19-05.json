        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 5 apples, 7 oranges, and 4 pears. So, total fruits in the box are 5 + 7 + 4, which equals 16 fruits.\n\nNow, the problem is about picking two fruits at random without replacement, and we need to find the probability that we get one apple and one orange. Okay, so no pears in this outcome.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I pick the first fruit, it's not going back into the box, so the total number of fruits decreases by one for the second pick.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible ways to pick two fruits out of 16.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to pick two fruits out of 16, I can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total ways = C(16, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that: C(16, 2) = 16! / (2!(16 - 2)!) = (16 \u00d7 15) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to pick any two fruits from the box.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is getting one apple and one orange.\n\nSo, number of ways to pick one apple out of five is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one orange out of seven is C(7, 1) = 7.\n\nSince these are independent events (picking an apple and then an orange, or an orange and then an apple), I need to consider both sequences: apple first and then orange, and orange first and then apple.\n\nBut wait, in combinations, order doesn't matter, so C(5,1) * C(7,1) should give me the total number of ways to pick one apple and one orange without regard to order.\n\nSo, number of favorable outcomes = 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nTherefore, probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 35 / 120.\n\nI can simplify that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 5, which gives 7/24.\n\nSo, the probability is 7/24.\n\nBut let me double-check this approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of permutations since the order of picking might matter in the calculation, even if it doesn't in the final probability.\n\nSo, using permutations:\n\nTotal number of ways to pick two fruits in order: 16 choices for the first pick, and 15 for the second, so 16 * 15 = 240.\n\nNumber of favorable ways:\n\n- Pick an apple first and then an orange: 5 choices for apple, then 7 for orange, so 5 * 7 = 35.\n\n- Pick an orange first and then an apple: 7 choices for orange, then 5 for apple, so 7 * 5 = 35.\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 35 + 35 = 70.\n\nTherefore, probability = 70 / 240 = 7/24.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can use probability rules.\n\nProbability of picking an apple first and then an orange:\n\nP(A then O) = P(A) * P(O | A)\n\nP(A) = 5/16 (since there are 5 apples out of 16 fruits).\n\nGiven that an apple is picked first, there are now 15 fruits left, including 7 oranges.\n\nSo, P(O | A) = 7/15.\n\nTherefore, P(A then O) = (5/16) * (7/15).\n\nSimilarly, probability of picking an orange first and then an apple:\n\nP(O then A) = P(O) * P(A | O)\n\nP(O) = 7/16.\n\nP(A | O) = 5/15 = 1/3.\n\nSo, P(O then A) = (7/16) * (1/3) = 7/48.\n\nNow, since these are mutually exclusive events (either A then O or O then A), the total probability is P(A then O) + P(O then A).\n\nLet's calculate P(A then O):\n\n(5/16) * (7/15) = (35)/(240) = 7/48.\n\nP(O then A): 7/48.\n\nSo, total probability = 7/48 + 7/48 = 14/48 = 7/24.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I keep getting 7/24 as the probability.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the concept of combinations directly in probabilities.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one apple and one orange is C(5,1) * C(7,1) = 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick any two fruits is C(16,2) = 120.\n\nSo, probability = 35 / 120 = 7/24.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that 7/24 is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any mistake in assuming that the pears are not relevant here.\n\nWell, pears are part of the total fruits, so they do affect the total number of possible outcomes, but since the problem specifies getting one apple and one orange, pears are not part of the favorable outcomes.\n\nHowever, pears do affect the probabilities because they are present in the box and can be picked, but since we're only interested in cases where we pick one apple and one orange, pears are effectively excluded from the favorable outcomes.\n\nBut in the calculations above, we've accounted for them in the total number of possible outcomes, which is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that once you pick two fruits, you look to see if one is an apple and one is an orange, regardless of the order.\n\nWe've covered that by considering combinations or by considering both permutations (A then O and O then A).\n\nSo, I think we've covered all the bases here.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking one apple and one orange is 7/24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{24}} \\]"
