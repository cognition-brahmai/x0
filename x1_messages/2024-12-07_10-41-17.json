        "content": "So if you have a square and you double its area, you want to know what happens to the length of its sides, right? Well, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, remember that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. So if the side length is 's', the area 'a' is s squared, or a = s\u00b2.\n\nNow, if we double the area, the new area 'a\u2082' is twice the original area, so a\u2082 = 2a.\n\nWe want to find out what happens to the side length, so let's call the new side length 's\u2082'.\n\nThe new area a\u2082 is equal to s\u2082 squared, so a\u2082 = s\u2082\u00b2.\n\nBut we know that a\u2082 is also equal to 2a, and since a is s\u00b2, then a\u2082 = 2s\u00b2.\n\nSo, s\u2082\u00b2 = 2s\u00b2.\n\nTo find s\u2082, we take the square root of both sides:\n\ns\u2082 = sqrt(2s\u00b2) = s * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the new side length is the original side length multiplied by the square root of 2.\n\nNow, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so the side length increases by a factor of about 1.414.\n\nTherefore, when you double the area of a square, the side lengths increase by a factor of sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414.\n\nDoes that make sense? Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?"
