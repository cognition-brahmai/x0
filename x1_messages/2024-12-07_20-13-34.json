        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, there's a 25% discount on an item that costs $80. So, I need to find out what 25% of $80 is and then subtract that from the original price to get the discounted price.\n\nTo find 25% of $80, I can calculate it as:\n\n25% of $80 = (25/100) * 80 = 0.25 * 80 = $20\n\nSo, the discount is $20. Now, subtract that from the original price:\n\n$80 - $20 = $60\n\nOkay, so the discounted price is $60.\n\nNext, there's a 10% sales tax added to this discounted price. So, I need to find out what 10% of $60 is and then add that to the discounted price to get the final cost.\n\nTo find 10% of $60:\n\n10% of $60 = (10/100) * 60 = 0.10 * 60 = $6\n\nSo, the sales tax is $6. Now, add that to the discounted price:\n\n$60 + $6 = $66\n\nTherefore, the final cost of the item after the discount and sales tax is $66.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to calculate it.\n\nAnother approach could be to first apply the discount and then apply the sales tax in a single step. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the discount is 25%, so the customer pays 75% of the original price.\n\n75% of $80 = 0.75 * 80 = $60\n\nThen, a 10% sales tax is added to $60.\n\n10% of $60 is $6, so adding that gives $60 + $6 = $66\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to combine the discount and the tax into a single calculation.\n\nLet's think about it.\n\nThe original price is $80.\n\nFirst, apply a 25% discount, which is the same as multiplying by (1 - 0.25) = 0.75.\n\nThen, apply a 10% sales tax to the result, which is the same as multiplying by (1 + 0.10) = 1.10.\n\nSo, the final price would be:\n\n$80 * 0.75 * 1.10\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, $80 * 0.75 = $60\n\nThen, $60 * 1.10 = $66\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can multiply the original price by both factors at once:\n\n$80 * 0.75 * 1.10\n\nLet's do the multiplication in a different order:\n\n$80 * 1.10 = $88\n\nThen, $88 * 0.75 = $66\n\nStill the same result.\n\nSo, no matter how I approach it, the final cost comes out to be $66.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there a possibility that the sales tax is applied before the discount? Hmm.\n\nWell, typically, the discount is applied first to the original price, and then sales tax is applied to the discounted price. That's the standard practice, I believe.\n\nBut to be sure, let's consider the other scenario where sales tax is applied first and then the discount.\n\nSo, if sales tax is applied first:\n\nOriginal price: $80\n\nApply 10% sales tax: $80 * 1.10 = $88\n\nThen apply 25% discount on $88: 25% of $88 is $22\n\nSo, $88 - $22 = $66\n\nAgain, the same final price of $66.\n\nWow, so no matter the order, the final price is $66.\n\nThat's interesting.\n\nTherefore, the final cost of the item is $66.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]"
