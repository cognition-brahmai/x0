        "content": "Let's see. The car travels 60 miles in 2 hours. So, first I need to find out how fast the car is going. Speed is distance divided by time, right? So, speed equals 60 miles divided by 2 hours, which is 30 miles per hour.\n\nNow, if the car continues at the same speed, I need to find out how far it will travel in 3 hours and 30 minutes. First, I need to convert 3 hours and 30 minutes into hours because the speed is in miles per hour. 30 minutes is half an hour, so 3 hours and 30 minutes is 3.5 hours.\n\nSo, distance equals speed multiplied by time. That would be 30 miles per hour times 3.5 hours. Let me calculate that: 30 times 3 is 90, and 30 times 0.5 is 15, so total distance is 90 plus 15, which is 105 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions. If the car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, then how many miles in 3.5 hours. So, set up a proportion: 60 miles is to 2 hours as x miles is to 3.5 hours.\n\nSo, 60/2 = x/3.5. Solving for x, x = (60/2) * 3.5 = 30 * 3.5 = 105 miles. Same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of unit rates. The car travels 30 miles per hour, so in one hour, it travels 30 miles. So, in 3 hours, it would travel 90 miles, and in 0.5 hours, it would travel 15 miles, total 105 miles. Again, the same answer.\n\nI think 105 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
