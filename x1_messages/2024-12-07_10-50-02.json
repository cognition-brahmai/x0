        "content": "No, you cannot get warts from touching frogs or toads. Warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a virus that affects humans. Frogs and toads may have bumps or warts on their skin, but these are not caused by HPV and cannot be transmitted to humans.\n\nThe misconception that touching frogs or toads can cause warts may have arisen because the bumps on their skin resemble human warts. However, these bumps serve a different purpose. In many frog and toad species, these bumps are part of their skin's texture and help with camouflage or protection.\n\nIt's always a good idea to wash your hands after handling any animals, including frogs and toads, as they can carry other types of bacteria or parasites that might be harmful if introduced to open wounds or mucous membranes. But rest assured, the warts you see on frogs and toads are not contagious to humans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No, warts cannot be contracted from touching frogs or toads.}} \\]"
