        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 3 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 7 green balls. So, in total, there are 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 balls in the bag.\n\nThe question is about finding the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball without replacement. That means once we draw the first ball, we don't put it back into the bag before drawing the second one.\n\nOkay, so probability of two events happening in sequence: first a red ball, then a blue ball, without replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability of drawing a red ball first.\n\nThere are 3 red balls out of 15 total balls, so the probability of drawing a red ball first is 3/15. Simplifying that, it's 1/5.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 3 divided by 15 is indeed 1/5, which is 0.2 or 20%.\n\nAlright, so P(Red first) = 1/5.\n\nNow, given that the first ball was red and we don't replace it, the total number of balls left in the bag is 14.\n\nOut of these remaining 14 balls, there are still 5 blue balls, since we only removed a red one.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a blue ball second, given that the first ball was red, is 5/14.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability of both events happening in sequence is the product of the two probabilities:\n\nP(Red then Blue) = P(Red first) * P(Blue second | Red first) = (1/5) * (5/14).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(1/5) * (5/14) = (1 * 5) / (5 * 14) = 5 / 70 = 1/14.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/14.\n\nWait a minute, let me see if there's another way to think about this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total number of ways to draw a red ball first and then a blue ball, divided by the total number of ways to draw any two balls in sequence without replacement.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw two balls in sequence without replacement is 15 choose 2, but since the order matters here, it's permutations: 15P2 = 15! / (15-2)! = 15 * 14 = 210.\n\nNumber of ways to draw a red ball first and then a blue ball: there are 3 red balls and 5 blue balls, so 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nTherefore, P(Red then Blue) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the order matters in combinations versus permutations.\n\nIn this case, since we're dealing with a sequence of events, order does matter, so using permutations is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, using combinations, the probability would be calculated differently, but in this case, the permutation approach seems straightforward and consistent with the initial calculation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the probability is indeed 1/14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{14}} \\]"
