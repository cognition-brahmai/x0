        "content": "So there are 6 red balls and 4 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 10 balls. I need to pick 3 balls randomly and find the probability of getting at least one red ball. Hmm, \"at least one red ball\" means either one red ball or two red balls or all three red balls. That could be a bit complicated to calculate directly, so maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nI recall that the probability of an event is equal to 1 minus the probability of its complement. So, the complement of getting at least one red ball is getting no red balls, which means getting all blue balls. So, maybe I can calculate the probability of picking all blue balls and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of getting at least one red ball.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of ways to pick 3 balls out of 10. That's a combination problem, right? The number of combinations of 10 items taken 3 at a time is calculated as 10 choose 3, which is 10! divided by (3! times (10-3)!). Let me calculate that:\n\n10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, but since factorial can get big, I can simplify it:\n\n10 choose 3 is (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 720 / 6 = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to pick 3 balls out of 10.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to pick 3 blue balls out of the 4 blue balls available. That's 4 choose 3.\n\n4 choose 3 is (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 24 / 6 = 4.\n\nSo, there are 4 ways to pick all blue balls.\n\nNow, the probability of picking all blue balls is the number of ways to pick all blue balls divided by the total number of ways to pick any 3 balls, which is 4 / 120 = 1 / 30 \u2248 0.0333 or 3.33%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least one red ball is 1 minus the probability of getting all blue balls, which is 1 - 1/30 = 29/30 \u2248 0.9667 or 96.67%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems really high. Is that possible? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick 3 balls out of 10 is indeed 10 choose 3 = 120.\n\nNumber of ways to pick 3 blue balls out of 4 is 4 choose 3 = 4.\n\nSo, probability of all blue balls is 4/120 = 1/30.\n\nTherefore, probability of at least one red ball is 1 - 1/30 = 29/30.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it directly by finding the probability of getting one red ball, two red balls, and three red balls, and then summing those probabilities, but that might be more time-consuming.\n\nLet me verify with the direct method to confirm.\n\nFirst, probability of getting exactly one red ball:\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red ball out of six is 6 choose 1 = 6.\n\nNumber of ways to pick two blue balls out of four is 4 choose 2 = (4 \u00d7 3) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 6.\n\nSo, number of ways to pick one red and two blue balls is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36.\n\nProbability is 36 / 120 = 3/10 = 0.3.\n\nNext, probability of getting exactly two red balls:\n\nNumber of ways to pick two red balls out of six is 6 choose 2 = (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 15.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one blue ball out of four is 4 choose 1 = 4.\n\nSo, number of ways to pick two red and one blue ball is 15 \u00d7 4 = 60.\n\nProbability is 60 / 120 = 1/2 = 0.5.\n\nThen, probability of getting exactly three red balls:\n\nNumber of ways to pick three red balls out of six is 6 choose 3 = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 20.\n\nNumber of ways to pick zero blue balls is 4 choose 0 = 1.\n\nSo, number of ways to pick three red balls is 20 \u00d7 1 = 20.\n\nProbability is 20 / 120 = 1/6 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nNow, summing these probabilities: 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.1667 = 0.9667, which matches the previous result of 29/30.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, confirming that the probability of getting at least one red ball is indeed 29/30 or approximately 96.67%.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of conditional probabilities or step by step, considering the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw, or if not, then on the second draw, and so on, but that seems more complicated than the combinatorial approach I used.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the probability of drawing a red ball in each draw without replacement. The probability of drawing a red ball first is 6/10 = 0.6. If the first ball is red, we're done. If not, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is then 6/9 \u2248 0.6667, and so on. But again, this seems more involved than the initial method.\n\nGiven that both methods give the same result, I'm confident that 29/30 is the correct probability for getting at least one red ball when picking three balls from a bag containing six red and four blue balls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{29}{30}} \\]"
