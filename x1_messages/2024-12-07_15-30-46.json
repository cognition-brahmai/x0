        "content": "So the baker uses 4 cups of flour to make 12 cookies, and I need to find out how many cups he'll need for 36 cookies. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how much flour is needed for one cookie. If 4 cups make 12 cookies, then for one cookie, it would be 4 cups divided by 12 cookies. That is, 4/12 = 1/3 cup per cookie.\n\nNow, if one cookie requires 1/3 cup of flour, then 36 cookies would require 36 times 1/3 cup. So, 36 * (1/3) = 12 cups.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. Another way to think about it is to see that 36 cookies are three times as many as 12 cookies because 36 divided by 12 is 3. So, if 12 cookies require 4 cups, then 36 cookies would require 3 times 4 cups, which is 12 cups.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is 12 cups. So, the baker will need 12 cups of flour to make 36 cookies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
