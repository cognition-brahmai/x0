Each step should correspond to an evidence value which is the outcome of a function given an input string that could be the user query, prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nTools Available:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables the user to conduct an internet search via DuckDuckGo search engine. Useful for locating sites that might contain the answer to the user's query.\nSiteReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline separated links. Input is one or more links and it outputs plain text containing the link contents.\nURLCollector[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and generates a plain text, newline separated response of URLs.\nZOE[input]: A question-answering language model. Particularly effective at answering queries based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a text question that refers to an #Evidence[n] variable.\n\nOutput Format:\nPlan: [Initial action based on user query]\n#Evidence0 = [Function call with input]\nPlan: [Subsequent action based on #Evidence0]\n#Evidence1 = [Next function call with input potentially referring to #Evidence0]\n...\nFinal Answer: [#Evidencen]\n\nQuestion: What are the main causes of global warming and their effects on marine life?"
