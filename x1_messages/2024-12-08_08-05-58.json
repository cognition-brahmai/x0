        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden with an area of 200 square meters and a perimeter of 60 meters. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find the length and the width of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, I recall that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, if we let the length be L and the width be W, then:\n\nArea = L * W = 200\n\nAlso, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides, which is twice the length plus twice the width. So:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W = 60\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) L * W = 200\n\n2) 2L + 2W = 60\n\nI need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of L and W.\n\nLet me try to simplify the second equation. I can factor out a 2:\n\n2(L + W) = 60\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nL + W = 30\n\nOkay, so L + W = 30.\n\nNow, I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for L in terms of W:\n\nL = 30 - W\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for L into the first equation:\n\n(30 - W) * W = 200\n\nLet's expand that:\n\n30W - W^2 = 200\n\nNow, I'll rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation form:\n\n-W^2 + 30W - 200 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:\n\nW^2 - 30W + 200 = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for W. I can use the quadratic formula:\n\nW = [30 \u00b1 sqrt(30^2 - 4*1*200)] / (2*1)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\nDiscriminant = 900 - 800 = 100\n\nSo, W = [30 \u00b1 sqrt(100)] / 2\n\nSqrt(100) is 10, so:\n\nW = [30 \u00b1 10] / 2\n\nFirst, plus:\n\nW = (30 + 10) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20\n\nThen, minus:\n\nW = (30 - 10) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10\n\nSo, W can be either 20 or 10.\n\nNow, recall that L = 30 - W.\n\nIf W = 20, then L = 30 - 20 = 10.\n\nIf W = 10, then L = 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nWait a minute, that means the dimensions are 10 meters and 20 meters. But in a rectangle, length is usually longer than the width, so it's likely that the length is 20 meters and the width is 10 meters.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy both the area and perimeter.\n\nFirst, area: 20 * 10 = 200 square meters. Correct.\n\nPerimeter: 2*20 + 2*10 = 40 + 20 = 60 meters. Correct.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 20 meters by 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, since both values satisfy the equations, it could also be considered as 10 meters by 20 meters, but essentially, it's the same rectangle.\n\nThere you go! The garden is 20 meters long and 10 meters wide.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20 \\text{ meters by } 10 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
