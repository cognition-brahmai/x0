        "content": "Let's see. I know that a human body typically has about 5 liters of blood. And I've heard that losing up to 15% of that blood is considered safe, meaning it's not life-threatening. So, I need to figure out how much blood that is in milliliters.\n\nFirst, I should convert liters to milliliters because the question asks for the answer in milliliters. I remember that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. So, 5 liters would be:\n\n5 liters \u00d7 1000 milliliters/liter = 5000 milliliters\n\nOkay, so the total blood volume is 5000 milliliters.\n\nNow, I need to find out what 15% of that is, because that's the maximum amount that can be lost safely. To find 15% of 5000 milliliters, I can multiply 5000 by 0.15 (since 15% is the same as 0.15 in decimal form).\n\nSo, 5000 milliliters \u00d7 0.15 = 750 milliliters\n\nTherefore, a person can lose up to 750 milliliters of blood safely without it being life-threatening.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 5 liters, which is 5000 milliliters.\n\nThen, 15% of 5000 is calculated by 5000 \u00d7 0.15.\n\nYes, that's 750 milliliters.\n\nSo, the safe amount of blood loss is 750 milliliters.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. For example, does the percentage change based on the person's size or health condition? I think generally, 15% is a rough estimate, but it might vary from person to person. However, since the question provides a general figure, I think using 15% of 5 liters is acceptable for this calculation.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm using the correct units. The question asks for milliliters, and I've converted liters to milliliters correctly.\n\nSo, my final answer is 750 milliliters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{750} \\]"
