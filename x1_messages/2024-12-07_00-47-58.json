        "content": "So there's this party with 10 vegetarians and 15 non-vegetarians, making a total of 25 people. You want to know the probability that if you pick three people at random, all of them will be non-vegetarians. Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how to calculate probability. Probability is basically the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is picking three non-vegetarians, and the total outcomes are all possible ways to pick any three people from the party.\n\nLet's start by figuring out the total number of ways to pick three people from 25. That sounds like a combination problem because the order doesn't matter; it's just about who gets picked, not the order in which they're picked.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose three people from 25 is:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25!}{3!(25 - 3)!} = \\frac{25!}{3! \\cdot 22!}\n\\]\n\nI don't need to calculate 25! fully because a lot of terms will cancel out. Let's simplify this:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22!}{3! \\times 22!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3!}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\nFirst, \\( 25 \\times 24 = 600 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 600 \\times 23 = 13,800 \\)\n\nFinally, \\( 13,800 \\div 6 = 2,300 \\)\n\nSo, there are 2,300 possible ways to choose any three people from the party.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to choose three non-vegetarians from the 15 non-vegetarians.\n\nUsing the combination formula again:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15!}{3!(15 - 3)!} = \\frac{15!}{3! \\cdot 12!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12!}{3! \\times 12!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3!}\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( 3! = 6 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{6}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, \\( 15 \\times 14 = 210 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 210 \\times 13 = 2,730 \\)\n\nFinally, \\( 2,730 \\div 6 = 455 \\)\n\nSo, there are 455 ways to choose three non-vegetarians from the 15 non-vegetarians.\n\nNow, the probability that all three picked people are non-vegetarians is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all non-vegetarians}) = \\frac{455}{2,300}\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5:\n\n\\[\n455 \u00f7 5 = 91\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2,300 \u00f7 5 = 460\n\\]\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{91}{460}\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, we can convert this to a decimal to get a sense of the probability:\n\n\\[\n91 \u00f7 460 \\approx 0.1978\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.1978, or 19.78%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities step by step instead of combinations.\n\nLet's think about it sequentially. The probability that the first person picked is a non-vegetarian is the number of non-vegetarians divided by the total number of people:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first is non-vegetarian}) = \\frac{15}{25} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nThen, given that the first person picked was a non-vegetarian, there are now 14 non-vegetarians left and a total of 24 people left. So, the probability that the second person picked is also a non-vegetarian is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{second is non-vegetarian} | \\text{first is non-vegetarian}) = \\frac{14}{24} \\approx 0.5833\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, if the first two picked are non-vegetarians, there are now 13 non-vegetarians left and 23 people in total. So, the probability that the third person picked is also a non-vegetarian is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{third is non-vegetarian} | \\text{first two are non-vegetarians}) = \\frac{13}{23} \\approx 0.5652\n\\]\n\nNow, the overall probability that all three are non-vegetarians is the product of these probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all three are non-vegetarians}) = 0.6 \\times 0.5833 \\times 0.5652 \\approx 0.1978\n\\]\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier: approximately 0.1978 or 19.78%.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the probability is indeed approximately 19.78%, or more precisely, 91/460.\n\nLet me just double-check if I did everything correctly. The combination method seems solid, and the step-by-step probability method also makes sense. Both approaches are valid for this type of problem, and they agree with each other, which increases my confidence in the answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using permutations instead of combinations. But in probability problems where the order doesn't matter, combinations are the way to go, so I think I've covered it appropriately.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's redo the combination calculations quickly.\n\nTotal ways to choose 3 from 25:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{6} = \\frac{13,800}{6} = 2,300\n\\]\n\nWays to choose 3 from 15 non-vegetarians:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{6} = \\frac{2,730}{6} = 455\n\\]\n\nThen, probability:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{455}{2,300} = \\frac{91}{460} \\approx 0.1978\n\\]\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, in the step-by-step approach:\n\nFirst pick: 15/25 = 0.6\n\nSecond pick: 14/24 \u2248 0.5833\n\nThird pick: 13/23 \u2248 0.5652\n\nProduct: 0.6 \u00d7 0.5833 \u00d7 0.5652 \u2248 0.1978\n\nAgain, consistent.\n\nI think I've covered this thoroughly. The probability is 91/460, or approximately 19.78%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{91}{460}} \\]"
