        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the garden is 25 meters long and 15 meters wide, and I need to find out two things: first, the area of the garden, and second, what the length of one side would be if the garden were reshaped into a square with the same area.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part: finding the area of the rectangular garden. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if the length is 25 meters and the width is 15 meters, the area should be:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\nArea = 25 meters \u00d7 15 meters\nArea = 375 square meters\n\nSo, the area of the garden is 375 square meters.\n\nNow, for the second part, I need to find out what the length of one side would be if this rectangle were converted into a square with the same area. A square has all sides equal, and its area is calculated by squaring the length of one side. So, if the area of the square is going to be the same as the area of the rectangle, which is 375 square meters, then I can set up the equation:\n\nSide^2 = 375\n\nTo find the length of one side, I need to take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nSide = \u221a375\n\nNow, let's calculate the square root of 375. I know that 19^2 is 361 and 20^2 is 400, so the square root of 375 should be between 19 and 20. Let me try to get a more precise value.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify \u221a375 by factoring it into perfect squares. 375 can be factored into 25 \u00d7 15, and since 25 is a perfect square, I can take it out of the square root:\n\n\u221a375 = \u221a(25 \u00d7 15) = \u221a25 \u00d7 \u221a15 = 5\u221a15\n\nSo, the side length of the square would be 5\u221a15 meters. But maybe the user would prefer a decimal approximation.\n\nLet me calculate the numerical value of \u221a15. I know that \u221a16 is 4 and \u221a9 is 3, so \u221a15 should be between 3 and 4. More precisely, \u221a15 is approximately 3.873.\n\nTherefore, 5\u221a15 \u2248 5 \u00d7 3.873 = 19.365 meters.\n\nSo, the length of one side of the square would be approximately 19.365 meters.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if my calculation is accurate. Let me verify the square root of 375.\n\nUsing a calculator, the square root of 375 is approximately 19.36491673, which rounds to about 19.365 meters. So, my earlier calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I square 19.365, I should get close to 375.\n\nLet's check: 19.365^2 = 375.000225, which is very close to 375, so it confirms my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the area of the garden is 375 square meters, and if it were converted to a square with the same area, each side of the square would be approximately 19.365 meters long.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the area of the rectangle: length times width, which is 25 meters times 15 meters, equals 375 square meters. That seems correct.\n\nSecond, for the square, the area is side squared, so side equals the square root of the area. The square root of 375 is approximately 19.365 meters, which matches my calculation.\n\nSo, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the garden is \\boxed{375} square meters, and the length of one side of the square would be approximately \\boxed{19.365} meters."
