        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The factory makes twice as many Type A widgets as Type B widgets, and the total production per day is 450 widgets. We need to find out how many Type B widgets are produced each day.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to represent the number of each type of widget produced. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of Type B widgets produced per day.\n\nSince the factory produces twice as many Type A widgets as Type B widgets, the number of Type A widgets produced per day would be \\( 2b \\).\n\nNow, the total production of widgets per day is the sum of Type A and Type B widgets. So, we can write an equation:\n\n\\[ b + 2b = 450 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, that gives:\n\n\\[ 3b = 450 \\]\n\nTo find \\( b \\), we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{450}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ b = 150 \\]\n\nSo, the factory produces 150 Type B widgets per day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If Type B widgets are 150, then Type A widgets would be twice that, which is 300. Adding them together: 150 + 300 equals 450, which matches the total production. Looks good!\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of Type A to Type B widgets. Since there are twice as many Type A widgets as Type B, the ratio is 2:1. That means for every 3 widgets produced (2 Type A and 1 Type B), 1 is Type B.\n\nSo, if we have a total of 450 widgets, and for every 3 widgets, 1 is Type B, we can find the number of Type B widgets by dividing the total production by 3:\n\n\\[ \\text{Type B widgets} = \\frac{450}{3} = 150 \\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using percentages or some other method, but I think the straightforward algebraic approach is the most efficient here.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the factory produces 150 Type B widgets per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
