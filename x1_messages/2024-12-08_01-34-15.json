        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. Type A widgets weigh 5 pounds each, and Type B widgets weigh 8 pounds each. There's a shipment that contains a total of 50 widgets, and the combined weight of all these widgets is 320 pounds. We need to figure out how many of each type are in the shipment.\n\nFirst, I think it would be helpful to set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Type A widgets.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Type B widgets.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of widgets is 50.\n\n2. The total weight of the widgets is 320 pounds.\n\nSo, we can translate these into equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 50 \\)  (since the total number of widgets is 50)\n\n2. \\( 5x + 8y = 320 \\)  (since Type A widgets weigh 5 pounds each and Type B widgets weigh 8 pounds each, and their total weight is 320 pounds)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. I'm familiar with a few methods to solve such systems, like substitution, elimination, or even using matrices. I think the elimination method might be straightforward here.\n\nLet me try the elimination method. First, I can solve the first equation for one of the variables, say \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 50 - y \\)\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 5(50 - y) + 8y = 320 \\)\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\n\\( 250 - 5y + 8y = 320 \\)\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\( 250 + 3y = 320 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 250 from both sides:\n\n\\( 3y = 70 \\)\n\nThen, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\)\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. If \\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\), which is approximately 23.333, but the number of widgets should be a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nStarting again with the equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5x + 8y = 320 \\)\n\nI substituted \\( x = 50 - y \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 5(50 - y) + 8y = 320 \\)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\( 250 - 5y + 8y = 320 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( 250 + 3y = 320 \\)\n\nSubtract 250 from both sides:\n\n\\( 3y = 70 \\)\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\)\n\nHmm, still getting the same result. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's try the elimination method differently.\n\nLet's manipulate the equations to eliminate one of the variables. Starting with:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5x + 8y = 320 \\)\n\nI can multiply the first equation by 5 to align the coefficients of \\( x \\):\n\n\\( 5x + 5y = 250 \\)\n\nNow, I have:\n\n1. \\( 5x + 5y = 250 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5x + 8y = 320 \\)\n\nNext, I can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \\( x \\):\n\n\\( (5x + 8y) - (5x + 5y) = 320 - 250 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 3y = 70 \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\), which is still not a whole number.\n\nWait a second, maybe there's a mistake in the problem itself, or perhaps I'm missing something. The problem states that there are 50 widgets with a total weight of 320 pounds, consisting of Type A (5 pounds each) and Type B (8 pounds each). But according to my calculations, the number of Type B widgets is not a whole number, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using ratios or considering the average weight.\n\nThe average weight of the widgets can be calculated as total weight divided by total number:\n\nAverage weight = \\( \\frac{320}{50} = 6.4 \\) pounds per widget.\n\nNow, Type A is 5 pounds and Type B is 8 pounds. So, the average weight is somewhere between 5 and 8, specifically at 6.4.\n\nWe can set up a ratio to find out how many of each type there are. Let's denote the proportion of Type A widgets as \\( p \\), and Type B as \\( 1 - p \\).\n\nThen, the average weight is:\n\n\\( 5p + 8(1 - p) = 6.4 \\)\n\nLet's solve for \\( p \\):\n\n\\( 5p + 8 - 8p = 6.4 \\)\n\n\\( -3p + 8 = 6.4 \\)\n\n\\( -3p = -1.6 \\)\n\n\\( p = \\frac{1.6}{3} \\approx 0.5333 \\)\n\nSo, approximately 53.33% are Type A widgets, and 46.67% are Type B.\n\nBut when I multiply by 50:\n\nType A: \\( 50 \\times 0.5333 \\approx 26.665 \\)\n\nType B: \\( 50 \\times 0.4667 \\approx 23.335 \\)\n\nAgain, not whole numbers. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem setup or in my approach.\n\nLet me consider if there's a possibility of fractional widgets, but that doesn't make sense in reality. Perhaps the problem is designed to have a solution with whole numbers, and maybe I need to re-examine my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the substitution method again and see where I'm going wrong.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\( x + y = 50 \\) => \\( x = 50 - y \\)\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n\\( 5(50 - y) + 8y = 320 \\)\n\n\\( 250 - 5y + 8y = 320 \\)\n\n\\( 250 + 3y = 320 \\)\n\n\\( 3y = 70 \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\approx 23.333 \\)\n\nThen, \\( x = 50 - \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{150 - 70}{3} = \\frac{80}{3} \\approx 26.667 \\)\n\nAgain, not whole numbers. Maybe the problem is designed to have non-integer solutions, which would be unusual for widget counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nIf the total number of widgets is 50 and the total weight is 320 pounds, with Type A being 5 pounds and Type B being 8 pounds, then maybe the numbers are incorrect, leading to non-integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try the matrix method to solve the system of equations.\n\nGiven the equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5x + 8y = 320 \\)\n\nIn matrix form, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n5 & 8\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n50 \\\\\n320\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we can find the inverse of the coefficient matrix and multiply it by the constants matrix.\n\nFirst, find the determinant of the coefficient matrix:\n\n\\( \\text{det} = (1 \\times 8) - (1 \\times 5) = 8 - 5 = 3 \\)\n\nSince the determinant is 3, which is not zero, the inverse exists.\n\nThe inverse of the coefficient matrix is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\text{det}} \\begin{bmatrix}\n8 & -1 \\\\\n-5 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\frac{1}{3} \\begin{bmatrix}\n8 & -1 \\\\\n-5 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply the inverse by the constants matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\frac{1}{3} \\begin{bmatrix}\n8 & -1 \\\\\n-5 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n50 \\\\\n320\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculate each component:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{1}{3} (8 \\times 50 + (-1) \\times 320) = \\frac{1}{3} (400 - 320) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 80 = \\frac{80}{3} \\approx 26.667 \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{1}{3} (-5 \\times 50 + 1 \\times 320) = \\frac{1}{3} (-250 + 320) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 70 = \\frac{70}{3} \\approx 23.333 \\)\n\nAgain, the same result. This suggests that the solution to the system is \\( x = \\frac{80}{3} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\), which are not integers.\n\nBut in the context of counting widgets, we'd expect whole numbers. Maybe the problem is intended to have integer solutions, and there's a typo in the numbers provided. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for non-integer quantities, which could represent partial widgets or some other interpretation.\n\nHowever, since the problem is about counting physical widgets, it's more likely that the numbers are intended to yield integer solutions. Maybe the total weight should be adjusted to make the solution come out to whole numbers.\n\nLet me try adjusting the total weight to see if I can find a number that would result in integer solutions. For example, if the total weight was 315 pounds instead of 320.\n\nSo, equations would be:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5x + 8y = 315 \\)\n\nUsing substitution:\n\n\\( x = 50 - y \\)\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n\\( 5(50 - y) + 8y = 315 \\)\n\n\\( 250 - 5y + 8y = 315 \\)\n\n\\( 250 + 3y = 315 \\)\n\n\\( 3y = 65 \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{65}{3} \\), still not an integer.\n\nWhat if the total weight is 325 pounds?\n\nEquations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5x + 8y = 325 \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 50 - y \\):\n\n\\( 5(50 - y) + 8y = 325 \\)\n\n\\( 250 - 5y + 8y = 325 \\)\n\n\\( 250 + 3y = 325 \\)\n\n\\( 3y = 75 \\)\n\n\\( y = 25 \\)\n\nThen, \\( x = 50 - 25 = 25 \\)\n\nThat gives integer solutions: 25 Type A and 25 Type B widgets.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal widgets: 25 + 25 = 50\n\nTotal weight: (25 * 5) + (25 * 8) = 125 + 200 = 325 pounds\n\nThat checks out, but the original problem states the total weight is 320 pounds, not 325.\n\nMaybe the intended total weight is 320, but according to my calculations, that leads to non-integer solutions. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for non-integer quantities, but that seems unlikely for counting widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the widgets are produced in packages or have some other constraints, but that information isn't provided.\n\nGiven that all my methods lead to the same non-integer solution, I might have to conclude that the problem, as stated, does not have integer solutions. However, since the context suggests that integer solutions are expected, there might be an error in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach I'm missing.\n\nLet me try to think of it in terms of differences in weight.\n\nType B widgets are 3 pounds heavier than Type A widgets (since 8 - 5 = 3).\n\nSuppose all 50 widgets are Type A, the total weight would be 50 * 5 = 250 pounds.\n\nBut the actual total weight is 320 pounds, which is 70 pounds more than 250.\n\nSince each Type B widget adds an extra 3 pounds compared to a Type A widget, the number of Type B widgets can be calculated as:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{320 - 250}{3} = \\frac{70}{3} \\approx 23.333 \\)\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the difference in weight is 3 pounds per Type B widget, and the total extra weight is 70 pounds, then \\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\), which again is not an integer.\n\nThis consistency across different methods reinforces that the solution is indeed \\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\) and \\( x = \\frac{80}{3} \\), but since we're dealing with whole widgets, this result is unsatisfactory.\n\nPerhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"A factory produces two types of widgets, Type A and Type B. Each Type A widget weighs 5 pounds, and each Type B widget weighs 8 pounds. If a shipment contains a total of 50 widgets with a combined weight of 320 pounds, how many of each type of widget are in the shipment?\"\n\nEverything seems straightforward. It's a classic system of equations problem. But according to my calculations, the solution isn't coming out to be integers.\n\nMaybe the problem is designed to illustrate that not all problems have integer solutions, or perhaps it's testing the ability to recognize when a problem has no feasible solution in the context of integer counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in fractions, interpreting them as partial widgets, but that seems unusual.\n\nGiven that, I'll present the solution as it is, acknowledging that it results in non-integer values for the number of widgets, which may not make sense in the real world.\n\nSo, according to the calculations:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\approx 23.333 \\) Type B widgets\n\n\\( x = \\frac{80}{3} \\approx 26.667 \\) Type A widgets\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a widget, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement or in the approach taken.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using a different method that accounts for integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint that wasn't considered, such as the minimum or maximum number of each type of widget that can be in the shipment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the weights are in different units, but the problem specifies pounds for both widget types.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of widgets isn't exactly 50, or the total weight isn't exactly 320 pounds, but close to it, and the problem allows for some tolerance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have no solution, to teach that not all systems have solutions.\n\nBut given that, I think the most straightforward approach is to present the solution as it is, acknowledging the non-integer result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider rounding the numbers to the nearest integer.\n\nIf I round \\( y = 23.333 \\) to 23 Type B widgets and \\( x = 26.667 \\) to 27 Type A widgets.\n\nLet me check if this satisfies the original equations.\n\nTotal widgets: 27 + 23 = 50\n\nTotal weight: (27 * 5) + (23 * 8) = 135 + 184 = 319 pounds\n\nWhich is 1 pound less than the specified 320 pounds.\n\nAlternatively, if I round y to 24 and x to 26.\n\nTotal widgets: 26 + 24 = 50\n\nTotal weight: (26 * 5) + (24 * 8) = 130 + 192 = 322 pounds\n\nWhich is 2 pounds more than 320.\n\nSo neither rounding approach gives exactly 320 pounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a combination of 24 Type B and 26 Type A widgets that gets closer.\n\nWait, in the second scenario, with 24 Type B and 26 Type A, the total weight is 322 pounds, which is still not 320.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's no integer solution, and the problem is designed to show that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation earlier on.\n\nLet me double-check the initial equations.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Each Type A widget weighs 5 pounds.\n\n- Each Type B widget weighs 8 pounds.\n\n- Total widgets: 50\n\n- Total weight: 320 pounds\n\nEquations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 50 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5x + 8y = 320 \\)\n\nSolving equation 1 for x: \\( x = 50 - y \\)\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n\\( 5(50 - y) + 8y = 320 \\)\n\n\\( 250 - 5y + 8y = 320 \\)\n\n\\( 250 + 3y = 320 \\)\n\n\\( 3y = 70 \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{70}{3} \\approx 23.333 \\)\n\nThen, \\( x = 50 - \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{150 - 70}{3} = \\frac{80}{3} \\approx 26.667 \\)\n\nThis seems correct. So, unless there's a different interpretation, it appears that the problem doesn't have an integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the weights are in different units, or there's a conversion factor involved, but the problem specifies pounds for both types.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, and the total weight should be different to yield integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for negative numbers or zero for one of the types, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using a different method that I'm not seeing.\n\nGiven all that, I think the most straightforward answer is that the system of equations leads to a non-integer solution, which may not be practical for counting widgets.\n\nTherefore, the shipment contains approximately 26.667 Type A widgets and 23.333 Type B widgets, but since we can't have fractions of widgets, there may be an error in the problem statement or in the approach taken.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows for partial widgets, then that would be the solution. But in reality, partial widgets don't make sense, so perhaps the problem is intended to have integer solutions and there's a mistake in the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory can produce widgets of fractional weights, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the weights include some variability or packaging weight, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven all that, I'll conclude that the problem, as stated, leads to a non-integer solution, which may not be practical in the real world.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The system of equations leads to non-integer solutions, suggesting a possible error in the problem statement or an need for re-evaluation of the approach.}} \\]"
