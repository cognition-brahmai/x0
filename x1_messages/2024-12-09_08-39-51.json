Her success with \"21\" solidified her position in the music industry, and she has continued to release critically acclaimed albums since then.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the artist you're referring to is Adele, and \"21\" is indeed one of her most famous works.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- Adele has released several other successful albums, including \"19\" (her debut album), \"25,\" and \"30.\"\n\n- She is known for her soulful voice and heartfelt lyrics that often deal with personal experiences, particularly relationships and heartbreak.\n\n- Adele has won numerous awards besides the Grammys, including Brit Awards and American Music Awards.\n\n- In 2016, she took a break from music to focus on her family and other interests but returned with her highly anticipated album \"25\" in 2015 and \"30\" in 2021.\n\nI hope this answers your question!
