        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the library has 1200 books in total. Out of these, 30% are fiction books, and the rest are non-fiction. I need to find out how many fiction and non-fiction books there are.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many fiction books there are. Since 30% of the books are fiction, I can calculate that by taking 30% of 1200. To find a percentage of a number, I use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{percentage} \\times \\text{total number} = \\text{part} \\]\n\nSo, for fiction books:\n\n\\[ 30\\% \\times 1200 = 0.30 \\times 1200 = 360 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 360 fiction books.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-fiction books, I can subtract the number of fiction books from the total number of books:\n\n\\[ 1200 - 360 = 840 \\]\n\nSo, there are 840 non-fiction books.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of non-fiction books first. Since 30% are fiction, the remaining percentage must be non-fiction. That would be:\n\n\\[ 100\\% - 30\\% = 70\\% \\]\n\nThen, I can find 70% of 1200 to get the number of non-fiction books:\n\n\\[ 70\\% \\times 1200 = 0.70 \\times 1200 = 840 \\]\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by subtracting the fiction books from the total. So, that's a good check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use proportions. If 30% are fiction, then for every 100 books, 30 are fiction and 70 are non-fiction. So, for 1200 books, I can set up a proportion:\n\nFor fiction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{100} = \\frac{x}{1200} \\]\n\nSolving for x:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{30 \\times 1200}{100} = 360 \\]\n\nSimilarly, for non-fiction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{70}{100} = \\frac{y}{1200} \\]\n\nSolving for y:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{70 \\times 1200}{100} = 840 \\]\n\nAgain, I get the same numbers. It's reassuring that different methods lead to the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe there are books that are both fiction and non-fiction, but that doesn't make sense in this context. The problem states that 30% are fiction and the rest are non-fiction, implying that all books are either fiction or non-fiction, with no overlap.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any books that don't fall into either category, but again, the problem says \"the rest are non-fiction,\" which suggests that all books are accounted for in either fiction or non-fiction.\n\nSo, I think the straightforward approach is the correct one here. Calculate 30% of 1200 for fiction, and then subtract that from the total to get non-fiction, or calculate 70% of 1200 for non-fiction.\n\nLet me summarize the possible answers:\n\n1. **Direct Calculation:**\n\n   - Fiction: 30% of 1200 = 360 books\n\n   - Non-fiction: 1200 - 360 = 840 books\n\n2. **Percentage Calculation for Non-fiction:**\n\n   - Non-fiction: 70% of 1200 = 840 books\n\n   - Fiction: 30% of 1200 = 360 books\n\n3. **Proportion Method:**\n\n   - Fiction: (30/100) * 1200 = 360 books\n\n   - Non-fiction: (70/100) * 1200 = 840 books\n\nAll these methods yield the same result, which increases confidence in the answer.\n\nNow, ranking these solutions:\n\n- **Solution 1:** This is the most direct and efficient method. It involves the least number of steps and directly applies the percentage to find the number of fiction books and then subtracts to find non-fiction books.\n\n- **Solution 2:** This is similar to Solution 1 but calculates the non-fiction books using their percentage directly. It's equally valid and provides a good check.\n\n- **Solution 3:** This method uses proportions, which is a bit more verbose but arrives at the same answer. It might be more intuitive for someone who prefers thinking in terms of ratios.\n\nGiven that all methods converge on the same answer, the best possible output is:\n\nThe library has 360 fiction books and 840 non-fiction books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360 \\text{ fiction books and } 840 \\text{ non-fiction books}} \\]"
