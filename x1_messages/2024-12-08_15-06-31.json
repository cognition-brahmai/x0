        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, all houses are either red or blue. The mayor lives in a red house, and residents who live in red houses tell the truth, while those in blue houses always lie. I asked a resident, \"Does the mayor live in your house?\" and the answer was \"No.\" I need to figure out what color the resident's house is.\n\nFirst, consider that if the resident lives in a red house, they tell the truth. So, if they say \"No,\" that means the mayor does not live in their house. But we know the mayor lives in a red house, so if the resident lives in a red house and says \"No,\" that would mean the mayor doesn't live there, which is true because the mayor lives in their own red house. So, that makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, if the resident lives in a blue house, they always lie. So, if they say \"No,\" that means the opposite is true: the mayor does live in their house. But the mayor only lives in their own red house, not in a blue house. So, this would be a lie, which aligns with the blue house resident always lying.\n\nWait a minute, in both scenarios, the answer \"No\" makes sense. If the resident is in a red house, they truthfully say the mayor isn't living there, and if they're in a blue house, they lie about the mayor living there, which isn't true.\n\nHmm, this seems confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the resident lives in a red house. Since they tell the truth, their answer \"No\" means the mayor does not live there, which is true.\n\nNow, assume the resident lives in a blue house. They lie, so their \"No\" actually means \"Yes,\" indicating that the mayor does live there. But the mayor only lives in their own red house, not in a blue house, so this would be a lie, which fits with the blue house resident always lying.\n\nWait, but in both cases, the answer \"No\" is consistent with the resident's house color. So, how do I determine the color of the resident's house based on their answer?\n\nMaybe I need to consider if there's any contradiction in either assumption.\n\nIf the resident lives in a red house, their \"No\" is true, and the mayor doesn't live there, which is correct.\n\nIf the resident lives in a blue house, their \"No\" is a lie, meaning the mayor does live there, which is false because the mayor lives in a red house.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible without contradiction.\n\nDoes that mean the resident could be living in either a red or blue house?\n\nBut the question is to determine the color of the resident's house based on their answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if there's a unique solution.\n\nLet me consider that the mayor lives in a red house, and no one else lives in the mayor's house.\n\nSo, if I ask a resident \"Does the mayor live in your house?\", the only person who could truthfully say \"Yes\" is the mayor themselves.\n\nBut in this case, the resident said \"No.\"\n\nTherefore, the only way \"No\" is answered is if the resident is not the mayor.\n\nBut both red and blue house residents, who are not the mayor, would say \"No.\"\n\nWait, but red house residents tell the truth, so they would say \"No\" if the mayor doesn't live in their house.\n\nBlue house residents lie, so they would also say \"No,\" meaning \"Yes, the mayor lives here,\" which is false.\n\nSo, again, both types of residents not being the mayor would say \"No.\"\n\nDoes that mean I can't determine the house color based on this single question?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to interpret the answer differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the mayor is the only one who lives in a red house, but that can't be, because there are multiple residents.\n\nWait, the problem states that every house is either red or blue, and those in red houses tell the truth, blue houses lie.\n\nThe mayor lives in a red house, but there can be other residents in red houses, assuming there are multiple red houses.\n\nBut the problem says \"the mayor lives in a red house,\" but doesn't specify if there are other red houses.\n\nWait, probably there are multiple red houses, since it's a town with multiple houses.\n\nSo, there could be multiple residents living in red houses, all telling the truth, and others in blue houses lying.\n\nGiven that, when I ask \"Does the mayor live in your house?\", only the mayor would say \"Yes,\" assuming they tell the truth.\n\nAll other residents, whether in red or blue houses, would say \"No,\" because the mayor doesn't live in their house.\n\nBut hold on, if there are multiple red houses, and residents in red houses tell the truth, they would say \"No,\" since the mayor doesn't live in their house.\n\nSimilarly, blue house residents lie, so they would say \"No,\" meaning \"Yes, the mayor lives here,\" which is false, indicating the mayor doesn't live there.\n\nWait, no, if a blue house resident says \"No,\" it means the opposite, which is \"Yes, the mayor lives here,\" but since they are lying, actually the mayor doesn't live there.\n\nSo, both red and blue house residents, except the mayor, would say \"No.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the answer \"No,\" I cannot determine the color of the resident's house, as both red and blue house residents not being the mayor would say \"No.\"\n\nThus, the color of the resident's house cannot be determined from this information alone.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u5c45\u6c11\u623f\u5c4b\u7684\u989c\u8272}} \\]"
