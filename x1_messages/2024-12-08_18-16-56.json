        "content": "So, I have this problem here: \"How many different ways can a committee of 4 people be selected from a group of 12 people?\" Hmm, this seems like a combination problem, right? Because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter; it's just about choosing who's on the committee.\n\nI remember that in combinations, we use the formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. So, in this case, \\( n = 12 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers: \\( C(12, 4) = \\frac{12!}{4!(12 - 4)!} = \\frac{12!}{4! \\times 8!} \\).\n\nNow, I need to calculate this. But calculating factorials can get messy, especially with large numbers. I know that \\( 12! \\) is 479,001,600, and \\( 8! \\) is 40,320, and \\( 4! \\) is 24. So, plugging these in:\n\n\\( \\frac{479,001,600}{24 \\times 40,320} \\).\n\nFirst, multiply 24 by 40,320, which is 967,680.\n\nThen, divide 479,001,600 by 967,680.\n\nLet me see: 479,001,600 \u00f7 967,680.\n\nHmm, I think there's a simpler way to compute this without dealing with such large numbers. I recall that factorials can be simplified when divided.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{12!}{8! \\times 4!} \\) can be written as \\( \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{8! \\times 4!} \\). Oh, wait a minute, the \\( 8! \\) in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n\nSo, it simplifies to \\( \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{4!} \\).\n\nAnd since \\( 4! = 24 \\), it's \\( \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{24} \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator: 12 \u00d7 11 = 132, then 132 \u00d7 10 = 1,320, and 1,320 \u00d7 9 = 11,880.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{11,880}{24} \\).\n\nNow, divide 11,880 by 24.\n\n24 \u00d7 495 = 11,880.\n\nSo, the answer should be 495.\n\nWait a second, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it step by step.\n\nStarting with \\( C(12, 4) \\), which is the number of combinations of 12 things taken 4 at a time.\n\nAnother way to compute this is to use the combination formula, but maybe I can use a calculator to verify.\n\nWait, I don't have a calculator right now, but perhaps I can compute it differently.\n\nI know that \\( C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k) \\), based on Pascal's triangle.\n\nSo, \\( C(12, 4) = C(11, 3) + C(11, 4) \\).\n\nBut that might not make it easier.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up a combination calculator online, but since I can't do that right now, I'll stick with the calculation I did earlier.\n\nSo, according to my earlier calculation, it's 495.\n\nLet me see if that makes sense.\n\nIf I have 12 people and I need to choose 4, it seems plausible that there are 495 different ways to do that.\n\nIs there a way to confirm this without a calculator?\n\nWell, I know that \\( C(10, 4) = 210 \\), and \\( C(10, 5) = 252 \\), but that doesn't directly help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of permutations.\n\nThe number of permutations of 12 things taken 4 at a time is \\( P(12, 4) = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 = 11,880 \\).\n\nBut since in combinations, order doesn't matter, I need to divide that by the number of ways to arrange 4 people, which is \\( 4! = 24 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{P(12, 4)}{4!} = \\frac{11,880}{24} = 495 \\).\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, it seems like there are 495 different ways to select a committee of 4 people from a group of 12.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should check with a smaller number.\n\nSuppose I have 5 people and need to choose 2.\n\nSo, \\( C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10 \\).\n\nYes, that makes sense: there are 10 ways to choose 2 people from 5.\n\nSimilarly, \\( C(6, 3) = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20 \\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to \\( C(12, 4) \\), my calculation of 495 seems accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 495.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{495} \\]"
