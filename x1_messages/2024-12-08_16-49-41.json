        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a factory produces 450 items per hour and operates for 16 hours a day. I need to find out how many days it will take to produce 144,000 items. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many items the factory produces in one day. Since it produces 450 items per hour and operates for 16 hours a day, I can multiply those two numbers to get the daily production.\n\nSo, daily production = 450 items/hour \u00d7 16 hours/day.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 450 \u00d7 16.\n\nWell, 450 \u00d7 10 is 4,500, and 450 \u00d7 6 is 2,700. Adding those together, 4,500 + 2,700 equals 7,200 items per day.\n\nAlright, so the factory produces 7,200 items each day.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many days it will take to produce 144,000 items. To do that, I can divide the total number of items needed by the number of items produced per day.\n\nSo, number of days = 144,000 items \u00f7 7,200 items/day.\n\nLet's do that division: 144,000 \u00f7 7,200.\n\nI can simplify this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 1,000 to make it easier: 144 \u00f7 7.2.\n\nHmm, 144 divided by 7.2.\n\nWell, 7.2 \u00d7 20 is 144, because 7 \u00d7 20 is 140, and 0.2 \u00d7 20 is 4, which adds up to 144.\n\nSo, 144 \u00f7 7.2 equals 20.\n\nTherefore, it will take 20 days to produce 144,000 items.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total production over the number of days and set it equal to 144,000.\n\nSo, total production = (items per hour) \u00d7 (hours per day) \u00d7 (number of days).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 450 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 number of days = 144,000.\n\nWe can solve for the number of days: number of days = 144,000 \u00f7 (450 \u00d7 16).\n\nWe already know from earlier that 450 \u00d7 16 is 7,200, and 144,000 \u00f7 7,200 is 20.\n\nSo, that matches our previous result.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check the multiplication and division again.\n\n450 \u00d7 16:\n\n450 \u00d7 10 = 4,500\n\n450 \u00d7 6 = 2,700\n\n4,500 + 2,700 = 7,200. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 144,000 \u00f7 7,200.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 144,000 divided by 7,200.\n\nI know that 7,200 \u00d7 20 = 144,000, because 7,200 \u00d7 10 = 72,000, and 72,000 \u00d7 2 = 144,000.\n\nSo, yes, 7,200 \u00d7 20 = 144,000.\n\nTherefore, the number of days required is indeed 20.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be extra sure, maybe I can consider if there are any other factors that might affect the production, like downtime or maintenance, but based on the information provided, the factory operates continuously for 16 hours each day without any mention of breaks or downtime.\n\nSo, I don't think there's anything else to consider here.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 20 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
