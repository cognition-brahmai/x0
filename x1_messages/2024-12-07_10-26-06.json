        "content": "So I've got this probability question here. It's about drawing two kings from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and the first card drawn isn't replaced before drawing the second one. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a standard deck looks like. There are 52 cards in total, divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has thirteen cards: ace through ten, and then the face cards jack, queen, and king. So, in total, there are four kings in the deck, one from each suit.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of drawing two kings in a row without replacing the first card. That means once I draw the first king, it stays out of the deck, and I draw the second card from the remaining cards.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. But since this is about two consecutive events, I need to consider conditional probability.\n\nLet's denote the events:\n\n- Event A: Drawing a king first.\n\n- Event B: Drawing a king second, given that the first card was a king and not replaced.\n\nI need to find the probability of both events A and B happening, which is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nFirst, let's find P(A), the probability of drawing a king first.\n\nThere are 4 kings in a deck of 52 cards, so:\n\nP(A) = 4/52 = 1/13.\n\nNext, P(B|A), the probability of drawing a king second, given that the first card drawn was a king.\n\nIf the first card was a king, there are now 3 kings left in the deck, and the total number of cards is now 51 (since we didn't replace the first card).\n\nSo, P(B|A) = 3/51 = 1/17.\n\nNow, to find the overall probability of both events happening, I multiply these two probabilities:\n\nP(A and B) = (1/13) * (1/17) = 1/221.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two kings in a row without replacement is 1/221.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this another way to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the number of ways to choose two kings from the four available, and divide that by the total number of ways to choose any two cards from the deck.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two kings from four is combination of 4 choose 2, which is calculated as:\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (4*3*2*1)/(2*1 * 2*1) = (4*3)/2 = 6.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any two cards from 52 is C(52,2):\n\nC(52,2) = 52! / (2! * 50!) = (52*51)/2 = 1326.\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nP = C(4,2) / C(52,2) = 6 / 1326 = 1 / 221.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability without using combinations. The probability of drawing a king first is 4/52, and then, without replacement, the probability of drawing another king is 3/51. Multiplying them gives (4/52)*(3/51) = (1/13)*(1/17) = 1/221.\n\nAgain, the same result. So, I'm confident that 1/221 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem specifies that the first card is not replaced, which is why the deck reduces to 51 cards for the second draw. If the card was replaced, the probability would be different, but that's not the case here.\n\nAlso, just to make sure, the cards are being drawn randomly, assuming a well-shuffled deck, so each card has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\nIs there any chance that the deck has jokers or other cards that aren't standard? The problem says \"standard playing cards,\" so it's safe to assume it's a standard 52-card deck.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the order matters. In this case, since we're specifically drawing two kings in a row, the order is important. But in the calculation above, we've considered the sequence of events, so that should be accounted for.\n\nI think that covers it. The probability is indeed 1/221.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{221}} \\]"
