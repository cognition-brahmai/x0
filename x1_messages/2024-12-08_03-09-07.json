        "content": "The musical instrument you're referring to is called the bagpipes. It's indeed closely associated with Scotland, although similar instruments are found in various cultures around the world. The traditional Scottish bagpipes consist of a bag, usually made from animal skin, which is filled with air using a blowpipe. Connected to the bag are several pipes: the drones and the chanter. The drones produce a constant pitch, creating a harmonic background, while the chanter is used to play the melody. Bagpipes are often featured in Scottish military bands and are played during formal ceremonies and celebrations."
