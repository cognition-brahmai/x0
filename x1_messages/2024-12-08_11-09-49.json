        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total. Out of these, 12 play basketball and 8 play soccer. The rest play volleyball. And each student plays only one sport. I need to find out how many more students play basketball than soccer.\n\nFirst, I should confirm how many students play each sport. We have:\n\n- Basketball: 12 students\n\n- Soccer: 8 students\n\n- Volleyball: the rest\n\nTo find out how many play volleyball, I can subtract the number of students who play basketball and soccer from the total number of students.\n\nSo, volleyball players = total students - basketball players - soccer players\n\nThat would be 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 students play volleyball.\n\nBut actually, the question is about how many more students play basketball than soccer. So, I need to find the difference between the number of basketball players and soccer players.\n\nDifference = basketball players - soccer players = 12 - 8 = 4\n\nSo, 4 more students play basketball than soccer.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? The problem says \"the rest play volleyball,\" and I calculated that as 10 students, but does it ask for that? No, it's asking for the difference between basketball and soccer players, which I've found to be 4.\n\nI think that's the answer. But let me double-check.\n\nTotal students: 30\n\nBasketball: 12\n\nSoccer: 8\n\nVolleyball: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10\n\nDifference between basketball and soccer: 12 - 8 = 4\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of percentages or other measures, but the question is straightforward: it just asks for the difference in the number of students playing basketball and soccer.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
