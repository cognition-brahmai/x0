Each step of your plan should be followed by an evidence variable that corresponds to the output of one of the available functions, given an input string that can either be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\n\n1. DuckDuckGo[input]: This tool allows users to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It is useful in finding relevant websites that may contain answers to the user's question. The function does not directly provide an answer; it generates a list of sites that might have the answer.\n2. TextParser[input]: Extracts and organizes important information from plain text. The input must be a plain text string.\n3. LinkExtractor[input]: Pulls out links from plain text and provides a plain text response containing newline-separated links.\n4. KnowledgeBaseQA[input]: A question-answering tool particularly adept at answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe input to each function should be a simple string without quotes or \"+\" signs to concatenate a string with an evidence variable (for example, KnowledgeBaseQA[What is the capital of France, given :evidence3:?]).\n\nEach step of your plan should include only one evidence output.\n\nYour output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some major achievements of Elon Musk?"
