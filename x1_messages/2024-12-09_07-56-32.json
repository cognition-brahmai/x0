        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling from Town A to Town B and back, and I need to find the average speed for the entire round trip. The train goes from A to B at 60 km/h and returns from B to A at 90 km/h. Okay, so average speed is total distance divided by total time, right?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total distance and the total time for the round trip. Let's assume the distance from Town A to Town B is D kilometers. So, the total distance for the round trip would be 2D kilometers.\n\nNow, for the trip from A to B at 60 km/h, the time taken would be distance divided by speed, which is D divided by 60 hours. Similarly, for the return trip from B to A at 90 km/h, the time taken would be D divided by 90 hours.\n\nSo, total time for the round trip is (D/60) + (D/90). I need to add these two fractions. To add them, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180. So, D/60 is equal to 3D/180, and D/90 is equal to 2D/180. Therefore, total time is (3D + 2D)/180 = 5D/180, which simplifies to D/36 hours.\n\nNow, total distance is 2D kilometers, and total time is D/36 hours. So, average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 2D divided by D/36. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that's 2D times 36/D. The D's cancel out, and I'm left with 2 times 36, which is 72 km/h.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the formula for average speed when two speeds are different but distances are the same?\n\nYeah, there is a formula for the average speed of two equal distances traveled at different speeds. It's the harmonic mean of the two speeds. The formula is: average speed = (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2).\n\nPlugging in the values, that's (2 * 60 * 90) / (60 + 90) = (2 * 5400) / 150 = 10800 / 150 = 72 km/h.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the average speed for the entire round trip is 72 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
