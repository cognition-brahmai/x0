        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a class of 25 students: 12 boys and 13 girls. Among the boys, 6 play soccer and 4 play basketball. Among the girls, 5 play soccer and 3 play basketball. We need to find the probability that a randomly selected student plays both soccer and basketball.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We're looking for the probability that a student plays both sports. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of students, which is 25. So, P(both) = number of students who play both soccer and basketball / 25.\n\nBut we don't directly know how many students play both sports. We only know how many play soccer and how many play basketball for both boys and girls separately. This seems like a job for the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, actually, inclusion-exclusion is used to find the total number of students who play either soccer or basketball, but here we need those who play both. Maybe I should consider the information given and see if I can find the overlap.\n\nLet's tabulate the information to make it clearer.\n\nFor boys:\n\n- Total boys: 12\n\n- Play soccer: 6\n\n- Play basketball: 4\n\n- Play both: ?\n\nFor girls:\n\n- Total girls: 13\n\n- Play soccer: 5\n\n- Play basketball: 3\n\n- Play both: ?\n\nTotal students: 25\n\nWe need to find the total number of students who play both soccer and basketball, which is the sum of boys who play both and girls who play both.\n\nBut the problem is, we don't have direct numbers for those who play both. We need to make some assumptions or find a way to calculate it.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can assume that the groups are mutually exclusive, but that doesn't make sense because some students might play both sports.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers given include those who play both. For example, in the boys, 6 play soccer and 4 play basketball. If some play both, then the total number of boys playing sports would be less than 10.\n\nLet me use the inclusion-exclusion principle for each group.\n\nFor boys:\n\nNumber of boys playing soccer or basketball = number playing soccer + number playing basketball - number playing both.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nB_s = boys playing soccer = 6\n\nB_b = boys playing basketball = 4\n\nB_both = boys playing both\n\nSo, total boys playing sports = B_s + B_b - B_both\n\nBut we don't know the total boys playing sports. Maybe some boys don't play any sports. The problem doesn't specify.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should consider the possibility that some boys don't play any sports.\n\nSimilarly for girls:\n\nG_s = girls playing soccer = 5\n\nG_b = girls playing basketball = 3\n\nG_both = girls playing both\n\nTotal girls playing sports = G_s + G_b - G_both\n\nAgain, we don't know the total girls playing sports.\n\nIt seems like we're missing some information here. Perhaps the problem assumes that all students play at least one sport, but that doesn't seem to be the case because the numbers don't add up that way.\n\nLet me check the total number of students.\n\nTotal students = 25\n\nTotal boys = 12\n\nTotal girls = 13\n\nNow, if we add up all the students playing soccer and basketball without considering overlaps:\n\nTotal students playing soccer = boys playing soccer + girls playing soccer = 6 + 5 = 11\n\nTotal students playing basketball = boys playing basketball + girls playing basketball = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nIf there were no overlap, the total students playing sports would be 11 + 7 = 18, but since some students might play both sports, the actual number of students playing sports is less than or equal to 18.\n\nHowever, the total number of students is 25, and if some students don't play any sports, then the number of students playing sports is less than 25.\n\nBut we don't know how many students don't play any sports.\n\nMaybe I can set up equations to solve for the number of students playing both sports.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Total students = 25\n\n- Students playing soccer = S = 6 (boys) + 5 (girls) = 11\n\n- Students playing basketball = B = 4 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 7\n\n- Students playing both = B_both (total both, boys plus girls)\n\nThen, according to the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nTotal students playing sports = S + B - B_both\n\nBut we don't know the total students playing sports.\n\nHowever, since some students may not play any sports, the total students playing sports could be less than or equal to 25.\n\nLet\u2019s denote students playing no sports as N.\n\nThen, S + B - B_both + N = 25\n\nBut we have too many unknowns here.\n\nWe need another equation or some additional information.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that all students play at least one sport, meaning N = 0.\n\nIf that's the case, then S + B - B_both = 25\n\nSo, 11 + 7 - B_both = 25\n\nWait, that would give B_both = 11 + 7 - 25 = -7, which doesn't make sense because the number of students can't be negative.\n\nThat means my assumption that all students play at least one sport is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, some students must not play any sports.\n\nSo, N > 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some students play both sports, and some don't play any.\n\nBut with the given numbers, it's unclear.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps the problem is expecting us to assume that the groups are mutually exclusive, meaning no student plays both sports.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem specifically asks for the probability that a student plays both soccer and basketball.\n\nIf there's no overlap, that probability would be zero, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nMoreover, in real life, it's possible for students to play both sports.\n\nTherefore, I shouldn't assume no overlap.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem provides enough information to find the exact number of students who play both sports.\n\nLet me try to find that.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Total students: 25\n\n- Boys: 12\n\n- Girls: 13\n\n- Boys playing soccer: 6\n\n- Boys playing basketball: 4\n\n- Girls playing soccer: 5\n\n- Girls playing basketball: 3\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Boys playing both: B_both\n\n- Girls playing both: G_both\n\nThen, the total number of students playing both sports is B_both + G_both.\n\nOur goal is to find B_both + G_both.\n\nNow, for boys:\n\nTotal boys playing sports = boys playing soccer + boys playing basketball - boys playing both\n\nSo, total boys playing sports = 6 + 4 - B_both = 10 - B_both\n\nSimilarly, for girls:\n\nTotal girls playing sports = 5 + 3 - G_both = 8 - G_both\n\nNow, the total number of students playing sports is the sum of boys and girls playing sports minus those who play both (since they are counted in both groups), but actually, in this case, it's already accounted for in the individual calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nTotal students playing sports = (total boys playing sports) + (total girls playing sports) - (students playing both sports)\n\nBut students playing both sports are those who are counted in both boys and girls playing sports, but since boys and girls are distinct groups, perhaps it's just the sum.\n\nWait, no, students are either boys or girls, so students playing both sports are either boys playing both or girls playing both, but they are already accounted for in their respective groups.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to think in terms of the total number of students involved in sports.\n\nTotal students playing soccer = 6 boys + 5 girls = 11\n\nTotal students playing basketball = 4 boys + 3 girls = 7\n\nBut some students might be playing both sports, so the total number of students playing sports is not necessarily 11 + 7 = 18, because that would count students playing both sports twice.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of students playing sports as T.\n\nThen, T = (students playing soccer) + (students playing basketball) - (students playing both sports)\n\nSo, T = 11 + 7 - (B_both + G_both) = 18 - (B_both + G_both)\n\nBut we also know that the total number of students is 25, and some may not play any sports.\n\nSo, T + N = 25, where N is the number of students not playing any sports.\n\nBut we don't know T or N.\n\nWe need another equation to solve for B_both + G_both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find B_both and G_both individually.\n\nBut with the given information, it seems insufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the total number of students playing sports cannot exceed 25.\n\nSo, T = 18 - (B_both + G_both) \u2264 25\n\nBut that doesn't help much, since 18 - X \u2264 25 implies X \u2265 -7, which is not useful.\n\nThis suggests that there must be some other relationship or information I can use.\n\nLet me consider the individual groups.\n\nFor boys:\n\nTotal boys = 12\n\nBoys playing only soccer = 6 - B_both\n\nBoys playing only basketball = 4 - B_both\n\nBoys playing both = B_both\n\nBoys playing no sports = 12 - (6 + 4 - B_both) = 12 - 10 + B_both = 2 + B_both\n\nSimilarly, for girls:\n\nTotal girls = 13\n\nGirls playing only soccer = 5 - G_both\n\nGirls playing only basketball = 3 - G_both\n\nGirls playing both = G_both\n\nGirls playing no sports = 13 - (5 + 3 - G_both) = 13 - 8 + G_both = 5 + G_both\n\nNow, the total number of students playing no sports is (2 + B_both) + (5 + G_both) = 7 + B_both + G_both\n\nBut we also have T + N = 25, where T = 18 - (B_both + G_both), and N = 7 + B_both + G_both\n\nSo, (18 - B_both - G_both) + (7 + B_both + G_both) = 25\n\nSimplifying: 18 - X + 7 + X = 25, where X = B_both + G_both\n\nSo, 25 = 25\n\nThis is an identity, which means it holds true for any X, but that doesn't help us find X.\n\nIt seems like the information provided is insufficient to determine the exact number of students playing both sports.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the groups are independent, and we can calculate the probability by multiplying the probabilities of playing each sport.\n\nBut that assumes independence, which may not be the case.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that we can find the number of students playing both sports.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that the total number of students playing sports is less than or equal to 25.\n\nFrom earlier, T = 18 - (B_both + G_both)\n\nBut T must be less than or equal to 25.\n\nSo, 18 - X \u2264 25 \u21d2 X \u2265 -7, which is always true since X is non-negative.\n\nThis doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a maximum possible value for T.\n\nThe maximum T can be 18 if X = 0, but T can be less than 18 if X is greater than 0.\n\nBut without knowing T, we can't find X.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to find T from the total number of students.\n\nWe have:\n\nTotal students = students playing sports + students not playing sports\n\n25 = T + N\n\nAnd T = 18 - X, where X = B_both + G_both\n\nAnd N = 7 + X\n\nSo, 25 = (18 - X) + (7 + X) = 25\n\nAgain, this holds true for any X, so it's not helpful.\n\nIt seems like the problem doesn't provide enough information to determine the number of students playing both sports.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something, and there's a way to find it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that no student plays both sports, so B_both = 0 and G_both = 0.\n\nBut that seems like an unwarranted assumption, and moreover, the problem specifically asks for the probability that a student plays both sports, which would be zero in that case.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic and unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a different way.\n\nLet me try calculating the total number of sport participations.\n\nTotal soccer players = 11\n\nTotal basketball players = 7\n\nTotal sport participations = 11 + 7 = 18\n\nBut some students play both sports, so they are counted twice in this total.\n\nIf no student played both sports, the total number of sport participations would be equal to the number of students playing sports, which would be 18.\n\nBut since some students play both sports, the actual number of students playing sports is less than 18.\n\nSpecifically, if X students play both sports, then the number of students playing sports is 18 - X.\n\nBut again, without knowing the number of students playing sports, we can't find X.\n\nWait, maybe the problem provides additional information that I'm not considering.\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\n\"In a class of 25 students, there are 12 boys and 13 girls. Among the boys, 6 play soccer and 4 play basketball. Among the girls, 5 play soccer and 3 play basketball. If one student is selected at random from the class, what is the probability that the student plays both soccer and basketball?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider that the number of students playing both sports can be found by considering the overlaps in the groups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume that the only students who play soccer are the ones specified, and similarly for basketball, with no information on overlaps.\n\nBut that doesn't help me find the overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the maximum possible overlap.\n\nThe maximum number of students who can play both sports is the smaller of the number playing soccer and the number playing basketball, which is min(11,7) = 7.\n\nThe minimum is zero, if no student plays both sports.\n\nBut without more constraints, I can't determine the exact number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to calculate the probability directly.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nWe need P(both) = number of students playing both sports / 25\n\nBut again, without knowing the number playing both sports, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the probabilities separately and see if I can find a relationship.\n\nProbability that a student plays soccer: P(soccer) = 11/25\n\nProbability that a student plays basketball: P(basketball) = 7/25\n\nIf I knew P(soccer or basketball), then I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle for probabilities:\n\nP(soccer or basketball) = P(soccer) + P(basketball) - P(both)\n\nThen, P(both) = P(soccer) + P(basketball) - P(soccer or basketball)\n\nBut I don't know P(soccer or basketball).\n\nAlternatively, if I knew P(neither), the probability that a student plays neither sport, then I could find P(soccer or basketball) = 1 - P(neither)\n\nBut I don't know P(neither) either.\n\nIt seems like I need more information to solve this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the number of students playing both sports can be determined from the given numbers.\n\nLet me try to see if there's any consistency in the numbers.\n\nTotal students = 25\n\nTotal boys = 12\n\nTotal girls = 13\n\nBoys playing soccer = 6\n\nBoys playing basketball = 4\n\nGirls playing soccer = 5\n\nGirls playing basketball = 3\n\nAssuming that some boys and girls play both sports, let's denote:\n\nB_both = number of boys playing both sports\n\nG_both = number of girls playing both sports\n\nThen, the total number of students playing soccer is:\n\nS = (6 - B_both) + (5 - G_both) + (B_both + G_both) = 6 + 5 = 11\n\nSimilarly, the total number of students playing basketball is:\n\nB = (4 - B_both) + (3 - G_both) + (B_both + G_both) = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nWait a minute, in this calculation, students playing both sports are already included in both soccer and basketball counts.\n\nSo, the total number of students playing sports would be:\n\nT = (6 - B_both) + (4 - B_both) + (5 - G_both) + (3 - G_both) + (B_both + G_both)\n\nSimplify:\n\nT = 6 + 4 + 5 + 3 - 2*B_both - 2*G_both + B_both + G_both = 18 - (B_both + G_both)\n\nBut earlier, we have T + N = 25, where N is students not playing any sports.\n\nSo, N = 25 - T = 25 - (18 - (B_both + G_both)) = 7 + B_both + G_both\n\nThis seems consistent with earlier calculations.\n\nBut without knowing T or N, I can't solve for B_both + G_both.\n\nIt appears that the problem doesn't provide sufficient information to determine the number of students playing both sports.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider that the problem might be expecting an assumption that no student plays both sports, but that seems unwarranted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have only one possible value for the number of students playing both sports, but based on my calculations, it seems like there are multiple possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the number of students playing both sports by considering the total number of sport participations.\n\nTotal sport participations = (6 boys playing soccer) + (4 boys playing basketball) + (5 girls playing soccer) + (3 girls playing basketball) = 18\n\nBut since students playing both sports are counted twice in this total, the actual number of students playing sports is 18 minus the number of students playing both sports.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of students playing both sports as X.\n\nThen, number of students playing sports = 18 - X\n\nBut we also know that the number of students playing sports cannot exceed the total number of students, which is 25.\n\nSo, 18 - X \u2264 25 \u21d2 X \u2265 -7, which is always true since X \u2265 0.\n\nThis doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint based on the number of boys and girls playing both sports.\n\nBut without additional information, it's impossible to determine X.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in terms of the possible range.\n\nThe minimum value of X is 0, and the maximum value is the smaller of the number of students playing soccer and basketball, which is 7.\n\nBut that seems too broad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a specific combination that fits the numbers.\n\nLet me consider that the number of boys playing both sports is B_both, and the number of girls playing both sports is G_both.\n\nThen, the total number of students playing both sports is X = B_both + G_both.\n\nWe need to find X.\n\nBut without knowing B_both and G_both individually, or another equation involving X, I can't find a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up a system of equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nB_both = number of boys playing both sports\n\nG_both = number of girls playing both sports\n\nX = B_both + G_both\n\nThen, the total number of students playing sports is T = 18 - X\n\nBut I don't have another independent equation to solve for X.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the problem, as stated, does not provide sufficient information to determine the number of students playing both sports.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is misstated or missing some information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and there's a simpler way to look at it.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that among the boys, 6 play soccer and 4 play basketball.\n\nThe number of boys playing both can be found using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nSimilarly for girls.\n\nFor boys:\n\nNumber of boys playing soccer or basketball = (6 + 4 - B_both)\n\nBut the total number of boys is 12, so the number of boys playing neither is 12 - (6 + 4 - B_both) = 12 - 10 + B_both = 2 + B_both\n\nSimilarly, for girls:\n\nNumber of girls playing soccer or basketball = (5 + 3 - G_both)\n\nTotal girls are 13, so the number of girls playing neither is 13 - (5 + 3 - G_both) = 13 - 8 + G_both = 5 + G_both\n\nThen, the total number of students playing neither is (2 + B_both) + (5 + G_both) = 7 + B_both + G_both\n\nAnd the total number of students is 25, which is equal to the number playing sports plus the number playing neither.\n\nNumber playing sports is T = 18 - X\n\nSo, T + N = 25 \u21d2 (18 - X) + (7 + X) = 25 \u21d2 25 = 25\n\nThis holds true for any X, so it doesn't help.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's no unique solution, and the problem is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the number of students playing both sports is zero, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find the number of students playing both sports by considering the overlaps in the groups.\n\nBut I don't see a straightforward way to do that with the given information.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that there isn't enough information to determine the probability.\n\nHowever, since this is a problem likely designed for practice, perhaps I've missed something.\n\nLet me try to consider specific values.\n\nSuppose that no boy plays both sports, so B_both = 0\n\nThen, the number of boys playing sports is 6 + 4 - 0 = 10\n\nNumber of boys playing neither is 12 - 10 = 2\n\nFor girls, suppose G_both = 0\n\nThen, number of girls playing sports is 5 + 3 - 0 = 8\n\nNumber of girls playing neither is 13 - 8 = 5\n\nTotal students playing neither is 2 + 5 = 7\n\nTotal students playing sports is 10 + 8 = 18\n\nTotal students: 18 + 7 = 25, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that one boy plays both sports, so B_both = 1\n\nThen, number of boys playing sports is 6 + 4 - 1 = 9\n\nNumber of boys playing neither is 12 - 9 = 3\n\nFor girls, suppose G_both = 1\n\nThen, number of girls playing sports is 5 + 3 - 1 = 7\n\nNumber of girls playing neither is 13 - 7 = 6\n\nTotal students playing neither is 3 + 6 = 9\n\nTotal students playing sports is 9 + 7 = 16\n\nTotal students: 16 + 9 = 25, which still matches.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations are possible.\n\nTherefore, without additional constraints, the number of students playing both sports can vary, and thus the probability cannot be determined uniquely.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved under the assumption that the groups are mutually exclusive, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n\"In a class of 25 students, there are 12 boys and 13 girls.
