        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"What is the sum of the first 10 terms of the arithmetic sequence with the first term as 3 and a common difference of 4?\" Okay, let's see. I remember that an arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. In this case, the first term is 3, and the common difference is 4.\n\nSo, the sequence would start like this: 3, 7, 11, 15, and so on, adding 4 each time. Now, I need to find the sum of the first 10 terms of this sequence.\n\nI recall there's a formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence. The formula is:\n\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the first n terms,\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms,\n\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term,\n\n- \\( a_n \\) is the nth term.\n\nAlternatively, there's another formula that might be useful:\n\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a_1 + (n-1)d) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\nI think I can use either formula, but maybe the second one would be easier since I know \\( a_1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( d \\), and I don't have to figure out what \\( a_n \\) is separately.\n\nLet me try using the second formula. So, plugging in the values:\n\n- \\( n = 10 \\),\n\n- \\( a_1 = 3 \\),\n\n- \\( d = 4 \\).\n\n\\[ S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} \\times (2 \\times 3 + (10 - 1) \\times 4) \\]\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\n\n\\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \\]\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\]\n\nNow, add those together:\n\n\\[ 6 + 36 = 42 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by \\( \\frac{10}{2} \\), which is 5:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 42 = 210 \\]\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 terms should be 210.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm using the formula correctly. Maybe I should try using the first formula to see if I get the same answer.\n\nFirst, I need to find the 10th term, \\( a_{10} \\). The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\]\n\nSo, for \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\[ a_{10} = 3 + (10 - 1) \\times 4 = 3 + 9 \\times 4 = 3 + 36 = 39 \\]\n\nNow, plug into the first sum formula:\n\n\\[ S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} \\times (3 + 39) = 5 \\times 42 = 210 \\]\n\nOkay, great, I get the same answer both ways. So, the sum is definitely 210.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try adding up the first 10 terms manually to confirm.\n\nStarting with 3, and adding 4 each time:\n\n1st term: 3\n\n2nd term: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n3rd term: 7 + 4 = 11\n\n4th term: 11 + 4 = 15\n\n5th term: 15 + 4 = 19\n\n6th term: 19 + 4 = 23\n\n7th term: 23 + 4 = 27\n\n8th term: 27 + 4 = 31\n\n9th term: 31 + 4 = 35\n\n10th term: 35 + 4 = 39\n\nNow, adding these up: 3 + 7 = 10, 10 + 11 = 21, 21 + 15 = 36, 36 + 19 = 55, 55 + 23 = 78, 78 + 27 = 105, 105 + 31 = 136, 136 + 35 = 171, 171 + 39 = 210.\n\nYes, that matches the result I got from the formula. So, I'm confident that 210 is the correct sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic sequence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]"
