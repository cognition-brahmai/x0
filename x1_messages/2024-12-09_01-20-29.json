        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are four houses in a row: red, blue, green, and yellow. The clues are:\n\n1. The red house is to the left of the blue house, but not necessarily next to it.\n\n2. The green house is immediately to the right of the red house.\n\n3. The yellow house is between the blue and green houses.\n\nOkay, first, since the green house is immediately to the right of the red house, that means red and green are next to each other, with red on the left and green on the right.\n\nSo, red is followed directly by green.\n\nNow, the yellow house is between the blue and green houses. That means yellow is next to both blue and green.\n\nBut green is already next to red, so yellow must be on the other side of green, towards blue.\n\nWait, let me try to sketch this out.\n\nLet's denote the positions from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nGiven that red is to the left of blue, and green is immediately to the right of red, and yellow is between blue and green.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the position of red first.\n\nIf red is in position 1, then green is in position 2.\n\nNow, yellow is between blue and green. Since green is in 2, and red is in 1, blue must be somewhere to the right of red.\n\nIf yellow is between blue and green, and green is in 2, then blue must be in 4, and yellow in 3.\n\nSo, the arrangement would be:\n\n1. Red\n\n2. Green\n\n3. Yellow\n\n4. Blue\n\nLet me check if this satisfies all conditions.\n\n- Red is to the left of blue: yes, red is in 1, blue in 4.\n\n- Green is immediately to the right of red: yes, red in 1, green in 2.\n\n- Yellow is between blue and green: yellow in 3, between green in 2 and blue in 4.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, is there another possible arrangement?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf red is in position 2, then green is in 3.\n\nYellow is between blue and green, so blue must be in 4, and yellow in 1.\n\nWait, but if yellow is in 1, that's to the left of red in 2, which contradicts the fact that red is to the left of blue, which is in 4.\n\nWait, no, red is in 2, blue in 4, which is fine.\n\nBut yellow is between blue and green, which are in 4 and 3 respectively.\n\nSo, yellow in 1 would not be between them.\n\nTherefore, this arrangement doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe yellow is in 2, but red is already in 2.\n\nNo, positions can't be occupied by two houses.\n\nAlternatively, red in 2, green in 3, blue in 4, yellow in 1.\n\nBut yellow is not between blue and green in this case.\n\nSo, the first arrangement seems to be the only one that works.\n\nTherefore, the order is red, green, yellow, blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Red, Green, Yellow, Blue}} \\]"
