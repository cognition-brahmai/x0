        "content": "Alright, I'm going to walk you through creating a simple REST API for task management using Node.js and Express. This API will allow you to create, read, update, and delete tasks, each with an ID, title, description, and status indicating whether they're completed or not.\n\nFirst things first, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js set up, open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir task-api\ncd task-api\n```\n\nNow, initialize a new Node.js project by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis command creates a `package.json` file with default settings, which helps manage your project's dependencies.\n\nNext, you'll need to install Express, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Run the following command to install Express:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\nWhile we're at it, let's also install some additional packages that will make our life easier:\n\n- `uuid` for generating unique IDs for tasks.\n\n- `body-parser` to parse incoming request bodies.\n\n- `cors` to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which is essential for allowing requests from different origins.\n\nInstall these packages with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install uuid body-parser cors\n```\n\nNow, let's set up the basic structure of our application. Create a new file called `app.js` in your project directory. This file will contain the main logic for our API.\n\nOpen `app.js` and start by requiring the necessary modules:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst uuid = require('uuid');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst cors = require('cors');\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// Middleware\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(cors());\n```\n\nHere, we're initializing Express, importing UUID for generating unique IDs, and setting up body-parser and cors middleware.\n\nNext, we'll create an in-memory array to store our tasks since we're keeping things simple and not using a database:\n\n```javascript\nlet tasks = [];\n```\n\nNow, let's define the CRUD operations:\n\n1. **Create a task** (`POST /tasks`):\n\nThis endpoint will allow users to create a new task by sending a JSON object with `title`, `description`, and `status`.\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/tasks', (req, res) => {\n    const { title, description, status } = req.body;\n    const id = uuid.v4();\n    const newTask = { id, title, description, status };\n    tasks.push(newTask);\n    res.status(201).json(newTask);\n});\n```\n\n2. **Read all tasks** (`GET /tasks`):\n\nThis endpoint will return all tasks in the array.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/tasks', (req, res) => {\n    res.json(tasks);\n});\n```\n\n3. **Read a single task** (`GET /tasks/:id`):\n\nThis endpoint will return a single task based on its ID.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/tasks/:id', (req, res) => {\n    const taskId = req.params.id;\n    const task = tasks.find(t => t.id === taskId);\n    if (!task) {\n        return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Task not found' });\n    }\n    res.json(task);\n});\n```\n\n4. **Update a task** (`PUT /tasks/:id`):\n\nThis endpoint will allow users to update a task's title, description, and status.\n\n```javascript\napp.put('/tasks/:id', (req, res) => {\n    const taskId = req.params.id;\n    const index = tasks.findIndex(t => t.id === taskId);\n    if (index === -1) {\n        return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Task not found' });\n    }\n    const updatedTask = { ...tasks[index], ...req.body };\n    tasks[index] = updatedTask;\n    res.json(updatedTask);\n});\n```\n\n5. **Delete a task** (`DELETE /tasks/:id`):\n\nThis endpoint will remove a task from the array based on its ID.\n\n```javascript\napp.delete('/tasks/:id', (req, res) => {\n    const taskId = req.params.id;\n    const index = tasks.findIndex(t => t.id === taskId);\n    if (index === -1) {\n        return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Task not found' });\n    }\n    const deletedTask = tasks.splice(index, 1);\n    res.json(deletedTask[0]);\n});\n```\n\nFinally, let's set up the server to listen on a specific port. You can choose any available port; I'll use port 3000 for this example:\n\n```javascript\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\nThat's it! You've now created a simple REST API for managing tasks using Node.js and Express. To test your API, you can use tools like Postman or curl to make HTTP requests to the defined endpoints.\n\nRemember, this is a basic implementation without a database, so all data will be lost when you restart the server. For a production-ready application, consider integrating a database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL to persist your data.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with building your task management API.
