        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train traveling between cities. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nA train goes from City A to City B in 2 hours, and the distance between them is 120 miles. Then it goes from City B to City C in 3 hours, and I need to find out the distance between City B and City C. The train maintains a constant speed throughout its journey.\n\nOkay, first things first, since the train maintains a constant speed, that means its speed doesn't change during the journey. So, the speed from A to B should be the same as from B to C.\n\nI know that speed is equal to distance divided by time. So, if the train goes from A to B, which is 120 miles in 2 hours, its speed would be 120 miles divided by 2 hours, which is 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, since the speed is constant, the speed from B to C should also be 60 miles per hour.\n\nThe time taken from B to C is 3 hours. So, if I use the formula distance equals speed multiplied by time, the distance from B to C should be 60 miles per hour times 3 hours, which is 180 miles.\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me make sure that the speed is indeed constant. From A to B, distance is 120 miles in 2 hours, which is 60 mph. From B to C, time is 3 hours, and if speed is constant at 60 mph, then distance should be 60 times 3, which is 180 miles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the total journey. The total time from A to C would be 2 hours plus 3 hours, which is 5 hours. If the speed is constant at 60 mph, the total distance from A to C should be 60 mph times 5 hours, which is 300 miles.\n\nBut the distance from A to B is 120 miles, so the distance from B to C should be the total distance minus the distance from A to B, which is 300 miles minus 120 miles, equaling 180 miles.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, the distance from B to C is 180 miles.\n\nI think that makes sense. Unless there's some trick I'm missing, but based on the information given, that should be the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
