        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company with 120 employees in total, and these employees are either managers or workers. The problem also states that there are twice as many workers as managers. We need to find out how many workers there are.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to represent the unknowns. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( m \\) represent the number of managers.\n\n- Let \\( w \\) represent the number of workers.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of employees is 120, which means:\n\n\\[ m + w = 120 \\]\n\nAlso, it's stated that there are twice as many workers as managers, which can be written as:\n\n\\[ w = 2m \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( m + w = 120 \\)\n\n2. \\( w = 2m \\)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ m + 2m = 120 \\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[ 3m = 120 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ m = 40 \\]\n\nSo, there are 40 managers. Now, to find the number of workers, we can use the second equation:\n\n\\[ w = 2m = 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 80 workers in the company.\n\nTo verify, let's check if the numbers add up to 120:\n\n\\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \\]\n\nAnd check if there are indeed twice as many workers as managers:\n\n\\[ 80 = 2 \\times 40 \\]\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
