        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, the train travels at an average speed of 60 kilometers per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance covered in this part, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nDistance1 = 60 km/h \u00d7 4 h = 240 kilometers\n\nThen, the train stops for a 30-minute break. Since it's not moving during this time, it doesn't cover any distance. So, the distance during the break is 0 kilometers.\n\nAfter the break, the train continues traveling at an average speed of 75 kilometers per hour for another 3 hours. Again, using the formula:\n\nDistance2 = 75 km/h \u00d7 3 h = 225 kilometers\n\nNow, to find the total distance covered by the train, we add the distances from both parts of the journey:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 240 km + 225 km = 465 kilometers\n\nSo, the total distance covered by the train is 465 kilometers."
