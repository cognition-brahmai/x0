        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two clocks: one that gains 1 minute every hour and another that loses 2 minutes every hour. Both are set correctly at noon, and we need to find out when they'll both show the same time again for the first time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how each clock's time deviates from the actual time over time. Let's denote the actual time passed in hours as \\( t \\).\n\nFor the first clock, which gains 1 minute every hour, its shown time will be the actual time plus the accumulated gain. Since it gains 1 minute per hour, after \\( t \\) hours, it will have gained \\( t \\) minutes. So, its shown time is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Clock 1 time} = \\text{actual time} + t \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSimilarly, for the second clock, which loses 2 minutes every hour, its shown time will be the actual time minus the accumulated loss. Losing 2 minutes per hour means after \\( t \\) hours, it will have lost \\( 2t \\) minutes. So, its shown time is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Clock 2 time} = \\text{actual time} - 2t \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nWe need to find the time \\( t \\) when both clocks show the same time. Therefore, we set their shown times equal to each other:\n\n\\[ \\text{actual time} + t = \\text{actual time} - 2t \\]\n\nWait a minute, but this seems off. If both clocks are showing the same time, but one is gaining and the other is losing minutes, I need to consider that their deviations are such that their shown times coincide.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps I should consider the relative rates at which the clocks gain or lose time.\n\nClock 1 gains 1 minute per hour, meaning its rate is 61 minutes per actual 60 minutes.\n\nClock 2 loses 2 minutes per hour, meaning its rate is 58 minutes per actual 60 minutes.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I need to think in terms of how much their times differ from the actual time and find when these differences make them show the same time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the difference in their rates.\n\nClock 1 gains 1 minute every hour, and Clock 2 loses 2 minutes every hour. So, relative to each other, the difference in their rates is 1 + 2 = 3 minutes per hour. That is, Clock 1 is getting ahead of Clock 2 by 3 minutes every hour.\n\nWait, but they start at the same time at noon. So, after one hour, Clock 1 will show 12:01, and Clock 2 will show 11:58, assuming they both started at 12:00.\n\nSo, the difference between Clock 1 and Clock 2 after one hour is 1 - (-2) = 3 minutes, as you said.\n\nSo, every hour, the difference between Clock 1 and Clock 2 increases by 3 minutes.\n\nBut we need to find when they show the same time again.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of when the accumulated difference is a multiple of 60 minutes, since time is cyclical in 60-minute increments.\n\nWait, but time is measured in hours, and clocks wrap around every 12 or 24 hours, but perhaps considering minutes is better.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the actual time in hours as \\( t \\).\n\nThen, the time shown by Clock 1 is:\n\n\\[ t_{\\text{clock1}} = t + \\frac{t}{60} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nWait, no. Since it gains 1 minute per hour, which is \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\) hours, but that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of minutes.\n\nLet\u2019s consider \\( t \\) in minutes.\n\nSo, after \\( t \\) minutes of actual time:\n\nClock 1 gains 1 minute per 60 minutes actual, so it gains \\( \\frac{t}{60} \\) minutes.\n\nTherefore, Clock 1 shows:\n\n\\[ t + \\frac{t}{60} = t \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{60}\\right) = t \\times \\frac{61}{60} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSimilarly, Clock 2 loses 2 minutes per 60 minutes actual, so it loses \\( \\frac{2t}{60} = \\frac{t}{30} \\) minutes.\n\nTherefore, Clock 2 shows:\n\n\\[ t - \\frac{t}{30} = t \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{30}\\right) = t \\times \\frac{29}{30} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\( t \\) such that both clocks show the same time. Since clock times are modulo 720 minutes (for a 12-hour clock) or 1440 minutes (for a 24-hour clock), I need to consider the modulo operation.\n\nAssuming we're dealing with a 12-hour clock, which is common, then the clock times repeat every 720 minutes (12 hours).\n\nSo, we need:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{61}{60} \\equiv t \\times \\frac{29}{30} \\pmod{720} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ t \\left( \\frac{61}{60} - \\frac{29}{30} \\right) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{720} \\]\n\nCalculating the difference:\n\n\\[ \\frac{61}{60} - \\frac{29}{30} = \\frac{61}{60} - \\frac{58}{60} = \\frac{3}{60} = \\frac{1}{20} \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{1}{20} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{720} \\]\n\nWhich implies:\n\n\\[ \\frac{t}{20} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{720} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14400} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's check the units. \\( t \\) is in minutes, and 14400 minutes is 14400 / 60 = 240 hours, which is 10 days.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe I need to consider the relative speeds more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think about how fast each clock is running relative to real time.\n\nClock 1 runs fast by 1 minute per hour, so its effective speed is 61 minutes per actual 60 minutes.\n\nClock 2 runs slow by 2 minutes per hour, so its effective speed is 58 minutes per actual 60 minutes.\n\nSo, for every actual hour, Clock 1 shows 61 minutes, and Clock 2 shows 58 minutes.\n\nWe need to find the time \\( t \\) (in actual hours) such that the time shown by both clocks is the same.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time shown by Clock 1 as \\( t_1 \\) and by Clock 2 as \\( t_2 \\), both in minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ t_1 = 61t \\]\n\n\\[ t_2 = 58t \\]\n\nBut since clock times are modulo 720 minutes (for a 12-hour clock), we have:\n\n\\[ 61t \\equiv 58t \\pmod{720} \\]\n\nSubtracting:\n\n\\[ 3t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{720} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{240} \\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 240k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nSince we're looking for the first time after noon that both clocks show the same time, we take the smallest positive \\( t \\), which is 240 hours.\n\nBut 240 hours is 10 days, which seems like a long time. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming a 12-hour clock.\n\nPerhaps the clocks are 24-hour clocks, meaning they cycle every 1440 minutes.\n\nLet's repeat the calculation with a 24-hour clock.\n\nSo, modulo 1440 minutes:\n\n\\[ 61t \\equiv 58t \\pmod{1440} \\]\n\n\\[ 3t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1440} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{480} \\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 480k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nThe smallest positive \\( t \\) is 480 hours, which is 20 days.\n\nThis also seems quite long. Maybe I need to consider that the clocks show the same time when their shown times differ by a multiple of 12 hours (720 minutes) or 24 hours (1440 minutes), depending on the clock type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to think about the relative speeds differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the rate at which the difference between the two clocks changes.\n\nClock 1 gains 1 minute per hour relative to real time, and Clock 2 loses 2 minutes per hour relative to real time. So, the difference in their rates is 1 + 2 = 3 minutes per hour.\n\nMeaning, every hour, the discrepancy between Clock 1 and Clock 2 increases by 3 minutes.\n\nSo, after \\( t \\) hours, the difference between Clock 1 and Clock 2 is \\( 3t \\) minutes.\n\nWe need this difference to be a multiple of 720 minutes (for a 12-hour clock) or 1440 minutes (for a 24-hour clock), so that their shown times coincide.\n\nIf we consider a 12-hour clock, then:\n\n\\[ 3t = 720k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 240k \\]\n\nAgain, \\( t = 240 \\) hours, which is 10 days.\n\nFor a 24-hour clock:\n\n\\[ 3t = 1440k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 480k \\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 480 \\) hours, which is 20 days.\n\nThis seems consistent with the previous calculation.\n\nBut perhaps the clocks could show the same time earlier if we consider that they both could have completed full cycles.\n\nWait, but in a 12-hour clock, times repeat every 12 hours, but since the clocks are gaining or losing minutes, their shown times won't necessarily align at 12-hour intervals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the angular speeds of the clock hands.\n\nBut that might be overly complicated.\n\nLet me consider an alternative approach.\n\nSuppose both clocks start at noon. After some time \\( t \\) hours, Clock 1 shows a time that is \\( t \\) minutes fast, and Clock 2 shows a time that is \\( 2t \\) minutes slow.\n\nSo, the time shown by Clock 1 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Noon} + t \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThe time shown by Clock 2 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Noon} - 2t \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nWe need these two times to be the same, considering the cyclical nature of time.\n\nSo, the difference between them should be a multiple of 12 hours (720 minutes) or 24 hours (1440 minutes).\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ t - (-2t) = 3t = 720k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 240k \\]\n\nAgain, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, for a 24-hour clock:\n\n\\[ 3t = 1440k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 480k \\]\n\nSo, the smallest positive \\( t \\) is 480 hours for a 24-hour clock.\n\nBut perhaps the problem assumes a 12-hour clock, in which case \\( t = 240 \\) hours.\n\nBut 240 hours is 10 days, which seems like a long time for the first coincidence.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the clocks could show the same time within the same day.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of when the accumulated gain and loss make their shown times equal, regardless of the cycle.\n\nLet\u2019s think about it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the actual time passed as \\( t \\) hours.\n\nThen, Clock 1 shows time:\n\n\\[ t + \\frac{t}{60} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nWait, no. Since it gains 1 minute per hour, which is \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\) hours, but that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, Clock 1 shows:\n\n\\[ t \\text{ hours} + t \\times \\frac{1}{60} \\text{ hours} = t \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{60}\\right) = t \\times \\frac{61}{60} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSimilarly, Clock 2 shows:\n\n\\[ t \\text{ hours} - t \\times \\frac{2}{60} \\text{ hours} = t \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{30}\\right) = t \\times \\frac{29}{30} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\( t \\) such that:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{61}{60} \\equiv t \\times \\frac{29}{30} \\pmod{12} \\]\n\nAssuming a 12-hour clock. Or perhaps modulo 24 for a 24-hour clock.\n\nBut I need to decide which type of clock it is. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's safer to assume a 12-hour clock.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\left( \\frac{61}{60} - \\frac{29}{30} \\right) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12} \\]\n\nCalculating the difference:\n\n\\[ \\frac{61}{60} - \\frac{29}{30} = \\frac{61}{60} - \\frac{58}{60} = \\frac{3}{60} = \\frac{1}{20} \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{1}{20} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12} \\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[ t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{240} \\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 240k \\) for integer \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive \\( t \\) is 240 hours, which is 10 days.\n\nBut maybe the clocks show the same time again before that.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the clocks are showing the same time when their shown times are congruent modulo 12 hours.\n\nSo, if Clock 1 shows a time that is equivalent to Clock 2's time modulo 12 hours, then they show the same time.\n\nTherefore, the equation should be:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{61}{60} \\equiv t \\times \\frac{29}{30} \\pmod{12} \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ t \\left( \\frac{61}{60} - \\frac{29}{30} \\right) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12} \\]\n\nAs before.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that the clocks could show the same time within the same day if their deviations cancel out in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the rates at which the clocks gain or lose time.\n\nClock 1 gains 1 minute every hour, so its rate is 61 minutes per 60 actual minutes.\n\nClock 2 loses 2 minutes every hour, so its rate is 58 minutes per 60 actual minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find when the number of minutes shown by both clocks are equal modulo 720 minutes (for a 12-hour clock).\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote actual time passed in hours as \\( t \\).\n\nThen, Clock 1 shows:\n\n\\[ 60t + t = 61t \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nClock 2 shows:\n\n\\[ 60t - 2t = 58t \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFor a 12-hour clock, times repeat every 720 minutes.\n\nSo, we need:\n\n\\[ 61t \\equiv 58t \\pmod{720} \\]\n\n\\[ 3t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{720} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{240} \\]\n\nAgain, \\( t = 240k \\), so the smallest positive \\( t \\) is 240 hours, which is 10 days.\n\nAlternatively, for a 24-hour clock, times repeat every 1440 minutes.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 61t \\equiv 58t \\pmod{1440} \\]\n\n\\[ 3t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1440} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{480} \\]\n\nThus, \\( t = 480k \\), so the smallest positive \\( t \\) is 480 hours, which is 20 days.\n\nThis seems consistent with previous calculations.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the clocks show time in minutes. Maybe I need to consider hours and minutes separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the positions of the clock hands.\n\nBut that might be too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the clocks will show the same time when the difference in their shown times is a multiple of 12 hours.\n\nSo, the difference between Clock 1 and Clock 2 is \\( t + 2t = 3t \\) minutes.\n\nWe need \\( 3t \\) to be a multiple of 720 minutes (for a 12-hour clock).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 3t = 720k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 240k \\]\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, for a 24-hour clock:\n\n\\[ 3t = 1440k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 480k \\]\n\nSo, the smallest positive \\( t \\) is 480 hours, which is 20 days.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the first time both clocks show the same time again is after 240 hours for a 12-hour clock, which is 10 days, or 480 hours for a 24-hour clock, which is 20 days.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in hours, considering the cyclical nature of the clock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shorter period where they coincide.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the clocks could show the same time within the same day if their deviations cancel out in some way.\n\nLet me consider specific times.\n\nAt noon, both show 12:00.\n\nAfter 1 hour:\n\n- Actual time: 1:00\n\n- Clock 1: 1:01\n\n- Clock 2: 12:58\n\nDifference: 1:01 - 12:58 = 3 minutes\n\nAfter 2 hours:\n\n- Actual time: 2:00\n\n- Clock 1: 2:02\n\n- Clock 2: 1:56\n\nDifference: 2:02 - 1:56 = 6 minutes\n\nAfter 3 hours:\n\n- Actual time: 3:00\n\n- Clock 1: 3:03\n\n- Clock 2: 2:54\n\nDifference: 3:03 - 2:54 = 9 minutes\n\n...\n\nAfter 240 hours:\n\n- Clock 1: gains 240 minutes, which is 4 hours\n\n- Clock 2: loses 480 minutes, which is 8 hours\n\nSo, Clock 1 shows 12:00 + 4 hours = 4:00\n\nClock 2 shows 12:00 - 8 hours = 4:00 (assuming a 12-hour clock)\n\nSo, they both show 4:00 after 240 hours.\n\nBut this seems like a long time. Maybe there's a mistake in assuming the type of clock.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the clocks could show the same time within the same day if their deviations make their shown times coincide.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the clocks could show the same time within the same 12-hour cycle.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the relative speed difference.\n\nClock 1 gains 1 minute per hour, and Clock 2 loses 2 minutes per hour, so their relative difference is 3 minutes per hour.\n\nTo make their shown times coincide, this relative difference needs to accumulate to a multiple of 12 hours (720 minutes).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 3t = 720k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 240k \\]\n\nAgain, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, for a 24-hour clock:\n\n\\[ 3t = 1440k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 480k \\]\n\nSo, the smallest positive \\( t \\) is 480 hours, which is 20 days.\n\nTherefore, depending on whether it's a 12-hour or 24-hour clock, the first time they both show the same time again is either 240 hours (10 days) or 480 hours (20 days).\n\nBut perhaps the problem assumes a 12-hour clock, in which case the answer is 240 hours, or 10 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we consider the rate at which each clock gains or loses time.\n\nClock 1 gains 1 minute every hour, so its rate is 61 minutes per 60 actual minutes.\n\nClock 2 loses 2 minutes every hour, so its rate is 58 minutes per 60 actual minutes.\n\nWe need to find when their shown times are the same.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the actual time passed as \\( t \\) hours.\n\nThen, the time shown by Clock 1 is:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{61}{60} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the time shown by Clock 2 is:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{58}{60} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nWe need these two to be equal, considering the cyclical nature of time.\n\nAssuming a 12-hour clock, times repeat every 12 hours, which is 720 minutes.\n\nSo, we need:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{61}{60} - t \\times \\frac{58}{60} = 12k \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\left( \\frac{61}{60} - \\frac{58}{60} \\right) = 12k \\]\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{3}{60} = 12k \\]\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{1}{20} = 12k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 240k \\]\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive \\( t \\) is 240 hours, which is 10 days.\n\nAlternatively, for a 24-hour clock:\n\n\\[ t \\times \\frac{1}{20} = 24k \\]\n\n\\[ t = 480k \\]\n\nSo, the smallest positive \\( t \\) is 480 hours, which is 20 days.\n\nTherefore, depending on whether the clocks are 12-hour or 24-hour clocks, the first time they both show the same time again is either 10 days or 20 days after they were set.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the type of clock, perhaps both answers are possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that even within a 12-hour cycle, their shown times could coincide due to their different rates.\n\nBut based on the calculations, it seems that the first coincidence occurs after 10 days for a 12-hour clock and 20 days for a 24-hour clock.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the first time both clocks show the same time again is after 240 hours, which is 10 days, assuming a 12-hour clock.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
