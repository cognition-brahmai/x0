        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and they play different sports: soccer, basketball, and volleyball. Specifically:\n\n- 18 play soccer\n\n- 20 play basketball\n\n- 22 play volleyball\n\nAnd some students play all three sports. The problem also states that every student plays at least one sport. We need to find out how many students play all three sports.\n\nFirst, I recall that for problems involving overlapping sets like this, it's often helpful to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The principle helps us account for elements that are counted in multiple sets.\n\nFor three sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle states:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + (A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nWhere:\n\n- Total is the total number of elements in the universal set.\n\n- A, B, C are the sizes of the individual sets.\n\n- A \u2229 B, A \u2229 C, B \u2229 C are the sizes of the pairwise intersections.\n\n- A \u2229 B \u2229 C is the size of the intersection of all three sets.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- Total = 30\n\n- A (soccer) = 18\n\n- B (basketball) = 20\n\n- C (volleyball) = 22\n\nWe need to find A \u2229 B \u2229 C.\n\nHowever, we don't know the pairwise intersections (A \u2229 B, A \u2229 C, B \u2229 C). But maybe we can express them in terms of A \u2229 B \u2229 C.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Only soccer: a\n\n- Only basketball: b\n\n- Only volleyball: c\n\n- Soccer and basketball but not volleyball: d\n\n- Soccer and volleyball but not basketball: e\n\n- Basketball and volleyball but not soccer: f\n\n- All three sports: g\n\nOur goal is to find g.\n\nFirst, we can express the total number of students in terms of these variables:\n\nTotal = a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 30\n\nNext, we can express the number of students playing each sport:\n\n- Soccer: a + d + e + g = 18\n\n- Basketball: b + d + f + g = 20\n\n- Volleyball: c + e + f + g = 22\n\nWe have four equations:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 30\n\n2. a + d + e + g = 18\n\n3. b + d + f + g = 20\n\n4. c + e + f + g = 22\n\nWe need to solve for g.\n\nLet's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(a + b + c + d + e + f + g) - (a + d + e + g) = 30 - 18\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nb + c + f = 12  ...(5)\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 3 from equation 1:\n\n(a + b + c + d + e + f + g) - (b + d + f + g) = 30 - 20\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\na + c + e = 10  ...(6)\n\nAnd subtract equation 4 from equation 1:\n\n(a + b + c + d + e + f + g) - (c + e + f + g) = 30 - 22\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\na + b + d = 8   ...(7)\n\nNow, let's add equations 2, 3, and 4:\n\n(a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) = 18 + 20 + 22 = 60\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\na + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 60  ...(8)\n\nNow, we also have equation 1:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f + g = 30\n\nLet's subtract equation 1 from equation 8:\n\n(a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g) - (a + b + c + d + e + f + g) = 60 - 30\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nd + e + f + 2g = 30  ...(9)\n\nNow, from equation 5: b + c + f = 12\n\nFrom equation 6: a + c + e = 10\n\nFrom equation 7: a + b + d = 8\n\nLet's add equations 5, 6, and 7:\n\n(b + c + f) + (a + c + e) + (a + b + d) = 12 + 10 + 8 = 30\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2a + 2b + c + c + d + e + f = 30\n\nWhich is:\n\n2a + 2b + 2c + d + e + f = 30  ...(10)\n\nNow, compare this to equation 1:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f + g = 30\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 10:\n\n(2a + 2b + 2c + d + e + f) - (a + b + c + d + e + f + g) = 30 - 30\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\na + b + c - g = 0\n\nTherefore:\n\na + b + c = g  ...(11)\n\nNow, recall equation 9:\n\nd + e + f + 2g = 30\n\nWe can express d + e + f as 30 - 2g  ...(12)\n\nNow, let's look back at equation 1:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f + g = 30\n\nSubstitute a + b + c from equation 11 and d + e + f from equation 12:\n\ng + (30 - 2g) + g = 30\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\ng + 30 - 2g + g = 30\n\nWhich is:\n\n30 = 30\n\nThis doesn't give us new information, so maybe we need another approach.\n\nLet's consider the sum of the individual sports:\n\nSoccer + Basketball + Volleyball = 18 + 20 + 22 = 60\n\nBut this counts students playing two sports twice and students playing all three sports three times.\n\nWe can express this as:\n\nSoccer + Basketball + Volleyball = Total + (Number of students playing two sports) + 2*(Number of students playing all three sports)\n\nWait, actually, the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets is:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + (A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nWe can rearrange this to:\n\nA + B + C = Total + (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) - (A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nBut I think I need to find a different way.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let x be the sum of the number of students playing exactly two sports, i.e., x = (A \u2229 B - A \u2229 B \u2229 C) + (A \u2229 C - A \u2229 B \u2229 C) + (B \u2229 C - A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\n- Let g be the number of students playing all three sports.\n\nThen, the total number of students playing at least one sport is:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (x + 3g) + g\n\nBecause A \u2229 B = (students playing exactly two sports: A and B) + (students playing all three sports)\n\nSimilarly for A \u2229 C and B \u2229 C.\n\nTherefore, A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C = x + 3g\n\nSubstituting back:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (x + 3g) + g = A + B + C - x - 3g + g = A + B + C - x - 2g\n\nBut also, Total = a + b + c + d + e + f + g\n\nWhere a + b + c + d + e + f + g = Total\n\nWait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I should use the inclusion-exclusion principle directly.\n\nGiven:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\nWe know Total = 30, A = 18, B = 20, C = 22\n\nSo:\n\n30 = 18 + 20 + 22 - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 = 60 - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\nLet\u2019s denote A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C as y, and A \u2229 B \u2229 C as g.\n\nThen:\n\n30 = 60 - y + g\n\nRearrange to solve for y:\n\ny = 60 - 30 + g = 30 + g\n\nBut y also represents the sum of students playing exactly two sports plus three times the students playing all three sports.\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nA \u2229 B = students playing exactly two sports (A and B but not C) plus students playing all three sports.\n\nSimilarly for A \u2229 C and B \u2229 C.\n\nTherefore:\n\ny = (A \u2229 B - g) + (A \u2229 C - g) + (B \u2229 C - g) + 3g = (A \u2229 B - g) + (A \u2229 C - g) + (B \u2229 C - g) + 3g = (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) = y\n\nWait, this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let p be the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\n- Let g be the number of students playing all three sports.\n\nThen:\n\nA \u2229 B = p_ab + g\n\nA \u2229 C = p_ac + g\n\nB \u2229 C = p_bc + g\n\nWhere p_ab is the number of students playing exactly soccer and basketball but not volleyball, and so on.\n\nThen, y = p_ab + p_ac + p_bc + 3g\n\nBut p = p_ab + p_ac + p_bc\n\nSo y = p + 3g\n\nSubstituting back into the inclusion-exclusion equation:\n\n30 = 60 - (p + 3g) + g\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 = 60 - p - 3g + g\n\n30 = 60 - p - 2g\n\nRearrange to solve for p:\n\np = 60 - 30 - 2g = 30 - 2g\n\nNow, the total number of students is also equal to the sum of students playing only one sport, exactly two sports, and all three sports.\n\nThat is:\n\nTotal = (a + b + c) + p + g = 30\n\nBut from earlier, a + b + c = g (from equation 11)\n\nSo:\n\ng + p + g = 30 \u21d2 2g + p = 30\n\nBut we have p = 30 - 2g from earlier.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2g + (30 - 2g) = 30 \u21d2 30 = 30\n\nAgain, this is an identity and doesn't help us find g.\n\nPerhaps there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the total number of sport participations.\n\nEach student is counted in each sport they play.\n\nSo, total sport participations = number of students playing soccer + basketball + volleyball = 18 + 20 + 22 = 60\n\nBut this counts students playing two sports twice and students playing all three sports three times.\n\nSince there are 30 students, and each plays at least one sport, the total number of sport participations can also be expressed as:\n\nTotal participations = number of students playing one sport + 2*(number of students playing exactly two sports) + 3*(number of students playing all three sports)\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- n1 = number of students playing exactly one sport\n\n- n2 = number of students playing exactly two sports\n\n- n3 = number of students playing all three sports\n\nThen:\n\nn1 + n2 + n3 = 30\n\nAnd:\n\nn1*1 + n2*2 + n3*3 = 60\n\nWe can set up a system of equations:\n\n1. n1 + n2 + n3 = 30\n\n2. n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 = 60\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(n1 + 2n2 + 3n3) - (n1 + n2 + n3) = 60 - 30\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nn2 + 2n3 = 30  ...(13)\n\nNow, we need another equation to solve for n2 and n3.\n\nRecall that the total number of students playing exactly two sports (n2) and those playing all three sports (n3) are related to the pairwise intersections.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nA \u2229 B = p_ab + g\n\nA \u2229 C = p_ac + g\n\nB \u2229 C = p_bc + g\n\nWhere p_ab, p_ac, p_bc are the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\nSo, p_ab + p_ac + p_bc = n2\n\nAnd g = n3\n\nWe also have:\n\nFrom equation 13: n2 + 2n3 = 30\n\nBut we need another equation to solve for n2 and n3.\n\nLooking back, we can use the sum of the pairwise intersections:\n\nA \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C = (p_ab + g) + (p_ac + g) + (p_bc + g) = n2 + 3n3\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion equation:\n\n30 = 60 - (n2 + 3n3) + n3 \u21d2 30 = 60 - n2 - 3n3 + n3 \u21d2 30 = 60 - n2 - 2n3\n\nRearrange:\n\nn2 + 2n3 = 30\n\nWhich is the same as equation 13.\n\nSo, we have only one equation with two variables. We need another equation.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the sum of students playing each pair of sports.\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nA \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C = n2 + 3n3\n\nBut we don't have a direct value for this sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express n1 in terms of n2 and n3.\n\nFrom equation 1: n1 = 30 - n2 - n3\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n(30 - n2 - n3) + 2n2 + 3n3 = 60 \u21d2 30 + n2 + 2n3 = 60 \u21d2 n2 + 2n3 = 30\n\nAgain, this is the same as equation 13.\n\nIt seems we're going in circles.\n\nMaybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the maximum possible overlap.\n\nThe total number of students is 30, and the number of students playing volleyball is 22, which is the highest among the three sports.\n\nSo, at most, 22 students can play all three sports, but that would require that all volleyball players also play soccer and basketball, which might not be the case.\n\nBut wait, 18 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 22 play volleyball.\n\nIf we consider the students who play volleyball, and see how many of them can also play the other two sports.\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the number of students playing at least two sports is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we denote:\n\n- Let a be the number of students playing exactly one sport.\n\n- Let b be the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\n- Let c be the number of students playing all three sports.\n\nWe have:\n\na + b + c = 30\n\nAnd the total number of sport participations is:\n\na + 2b + 3c = 60\n\nWe can subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(a + 2b + 3c) - (a + b + c) = 60 - 30 \u21d2 b + 2c = 30\n\nSo, b + 2c = 30\n\nNow, we need another equation to solve for b and c.\n\nBut it seems we don't have enough information yet.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express a in terms of b and c:\n\na = 30 - b - c\n\nAnd substitute into the second equation:\n\n(30 - b - c) + 2b + 3c = 60 \u21d2 30 + b + 2c = 60 \u21d2 b + 2c = 30\n\nWhich is the same equation as above.\n\nSo, we need another relationship.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the number of students playing each sport.\n\nFor soccer:\n\nNumber of students playing soccer = students playing only soccer + students playing soccer and one other sport + students playing all three sports.\n\nSo:\n\n18 = (a corresponding to soccer) + (b corresponding to soccer and one other sport) + c\n\nSimilarly for basketball and volleyball.\n\nBut this seems too vague without specific numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set up equations based on the number of students playing each pair of sports.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let p_ab be the number of students playing soccer and basketball but not volleyball.\n\n- Let p_ac be the number of students playing soccer and volleyball but not basketball.\n\n- Let p_bc be the number of students playing basketball and volleyball but not soccer.\n\nThen:\n\nA \u2229 B = p_ab + c\n\nA \u2229 C = p_ac + c\n\nB \u2229 C = p_bc + c\n\nSo, the sum A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C = p_ab + p_ac + p_bc + 3c\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + C\n\n30 = 18 + 20 + 22 - (p_ab + p_ac + p_bc + 3c) + c\n\n30 = 60 - p_ab - p_ac - p_bc - 3c + c\n\n30 = 60 - (p_ab + p_ac + p_bc + 2c)\n\nRearrange:\n\np_ab + p_ac + p_bc + 2c = 30\n\nBut p_ab + p_ac + p_bc is the number of students playing exactly two sports, which we can denote as b.\n\nSo:\n\nb + 2c = 30\n\nWhich is the same equation we had earlier.\n\nIt seems we are stuck in a loop again.\n\nPerhaps there is a different method to approach this problem.\n\nLet me consider the minimal number of students playing all three sports.\n\nIf possible, let's assume that as many students as possible are playing only one or two sports to minimize those playing all three.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in the problem setup.\n\nLet me check the total number of sport participations.\n\nTotal participations = 18 (soccer) + 20 (basketball) + 22 (volleyball) = 60\n\nBut there are only 30 students, and each plays at least one sport.\n\nSo, on average, each student plays 2 sports.\n\nBut some play one, some two, some three.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\na + b + c = 30\n\nAnd\n\na + 2b + 3c = 60\n\nSubtracting the first from the second:\n\nb + 2c = 30\n\nThis seems to be the key equation.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for b and c such that b + 2c = 30.\n\nAlso, since b and c are non-negative integers, and c cannot exceed the number of students playing all three sports, which is limited by the smallest number of students in any sport.\n\nWait, c cannot be more than the number of students in any single sport.\n\nThe smallest sport is soccer with 18 students, so c \u2264 18.\n\nSimilarly, c cannot exceed 20 (basketball) or 22 (volleyball).\n\nSo, c \u2264 18.\n\nNow, from b + 2c = 30, we can express b = 30 - 2c\n\nSince b must be non-negative, 30 - 2c \u2265 0 \u21d2 c \u2264 15\n\nSo, c can be at most 15.\n\nAlso, c must be such that the number of students playing each sport is satisfied.\n\nLet me check if c = 10 is possible.\n\nIf c = 10, then b = 30 - 20 = 10\n\nThen a = 30 - b - c = 30 - 10 - 10 = 10\n\nNow, check if this satisfies the number of students in each sport.\n\nStudents playing soccer: a_s + b_s + c = 18\n\nWhere a_s is students playing only soccer, b_s is students playing soccer and one other sport but not all three.\n\nSimilarly for basketball and volleyball.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps there is a different approach.\n\nLet me try to use the inclusion-exclusion principle again.\n\nWe have:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\n30 = 18 + 20 + 22 - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\n30 = 60 - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\nLet\u2019s denote A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C as S and A \u2229 B \u2229 C as C.\n\nThen:\n\n30 = 60 - S + C \u21d2 S - C = 30\n\nBut S = A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C\n\nWe can also express S in terms of C.\n\nEach of A \u2229 B, A \u2229 C, and B \u2229 C includes students who play all three sports, C.\n\nSo, A \u2229 B = p_ab + C, where p_ab is the number of students playing only soccer and basketball.\n\nSimilarly, A \u2229 C = p_ac + C and B \u2229 C = p_bc + C\n\nTherefore, S = p_ab + p_ac + p_bc + 3C\n\nSubstituting back:\n\np_ab + p_ac + p_bc + 3C - C = 30 \u21d2 p_ab + p_ac + p_bc + 2C = 30\n\nBut p_ab + p_ac + p_bc is the number of students playing exactly two sports, which we can denote as b.\n\nSo, b + 2C = 30\n\nThis is the same equation as before.\n\nIt seems we keep arriving at the same point.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider the maximum possible value for C.\n\nGiven that C cannot exceed the smallest number of students in any sport, which is 18 for soccer.\n\nBut also, considering the total number of students is 30, and the sum of students playing each sport is 60.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the sum of the students playing each sport:\n\nA + B + C = 18 + 20 + 22 = 60\n\nBut this counts students playing two sports twice and students playing all three sports three times.\n\nSo, the actual number of individual student-sport participations is 60.\n\nBut since there are 30 students, and each student plays at least one sport, the average number of sports per student is 2.\n\nThis suggests that there are enough participations to account for students playing multiple sports.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can find the number of students playing all three sports by considering the overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of students playing at least two sports is related to the pairwise intersections and the triple intersection.\n\nWait, perhaps I can set up the equation in terms of the number of students playing at least two sports.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let m be the number of students playing at least two sports.\n\nThen, m = number of students playing exactly two sports + number of students playing all three sports = b + c\n\nFrom earlier, we have b + 2c = 30\n\nSo, m = b + c\n\nBut we don't have another equation to relate m and c.\n\nThis seems fruitless.\n\nMaybe I need to accept that with the given information, there are multiple solutions, but the problem states that \"some students play all three sports,\" implying there is a specific number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique solution hidden in the equations we have.\n\nLet me consider that the number of students playing all three sports is maximized.\n\nGiven that c \u2264 15 from earlier, and c \u2264 18 from the soccer players, c \u2264 20 from basketball, and c \u2264 22 from volleyball.\n\nSo, c \u2264 15.\n\nSimilarly, c must be such that the number of students playing each sport is satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of students playing exactly two sports and all three sports is related to the total participations.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose we consider the students who play volleyball, since it has the highest number of players.\n\nThere are 22 students playing volleyball.\n\nNow, the total number of students is 30.\n\nIf we consider the students who play volleyball and possibly other sports, and those who play only soccer and/or basketball.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for pairs of sports.\n\nLet\u2019s consider soccer and basketball.\n\nNumber of students playing soccer or basketball or both is:\n\nA + B - (A \u2229 B) = 18 + 20 - (A \u2229 B)\n\nBut this counts students playing volleyball as well, if they play soccer or basketball.\n\nWait, this seems too tangled.\n\nPerhaps I need to look for a different formula or approach.\n\nLet me recall that in inclusion-exclusion for three sets:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for A \u2229 B \u2229 C:\n\nA \u2229 B \u2229 C = Total - A - B - C + (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C)\n\nBut we don't know A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C in terms of the individual intersections.\n\nThis seems like a dead end.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the students who play only one sport.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Only soccer: a = A - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nOnly soccer: A - (A \u2229 B) - (A \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\nSimilarly for only basketball and only volleyball.\n\nThen, the total number of students playing only one sport is:\n\na + b + c = (A - (A \u2229 B) - (A \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C) + (B - (A \u2229 B) - (B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C) + (C - (A \u2229 C) - (B \u2229 C) + A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nSimplify:\n\na + b + c = A + B + C - 2*(A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + 3*A \u2229 B \u2229 C\n\nBut total students playing only one sport plus those playing at least two sports equals the total number of students.\n\nThis seems too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should try plugging in numbers.\n\nSuppose that the number of students playing all three sports is g.\n\nThen, the number of students playing exactly two sports can be expressed in terms of g.\n\nBut without specific numbers for the pairwise intersections, this is difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the sum of the pairwise intersections.\n\nA \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C = (number of students playing exactly two sports) + 3*(number of students playing all three sports)\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nA \u2229 B = (number of students playing exactly two sports: soccer and basketball) + (number playing all three sports)\n\nSimilarly for A \u2229 C and B \u2229 C.\n\nTherefore, A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C = (number of students playing exactly two sports) + 3*(number of students playing all three sports)\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let n2 be the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\n- Let n3 be the number of students playing all three sports.\n\nThen:\n\nA \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C = n2 + 3n3\n\nSubstituting back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (n2 + 3n3) + n3 = A + B + C - n2 - 2n3\n\nWe know Total = 30, A + B + C = 60, so:\n\n30 = 60 - n2 - 2n3 \u21d2 n2 + 2n3 = 30\n\nThis is consistent with our earlier equation.\n\nNow, we need another equation to solve for n2 and n3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the total number of students playing at least one sport.\n\nBut since every student plays at least one sport, this is equal to the total number of students, which is 30.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the number of students playing exactly one sport.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- n1 = number of students playing exactly one sport\n\n- n2 = number of students playing exactly two sports\n\n- n3 = number of students playing all three sports\n\nThen:\n\nn1 + n2 + n3 = 30\n\nAnd:\n\nn1 + 2n2 + 3n3 = 60 (total sport participations)\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. n1 + n2 + n3 = 30\n\n2. n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 = 60\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(n1 + 2n2 + 3n3) - (n1 + n2 + n3) = 60 - 30 \u21d2 n2 + 2n3 = 30\n\nThis is the same equation as before.\n\nNow, we need another equation to solve for n2 and n3.\n\nPerhaps I can look at the number of students playing each sport and express them in terms of n1, n2, and n3.\n\nFor soccer:\n\nNumber of students playing soccer = n1_s + n2_s + n3\n\nWhere n1_s is the number of students playing only soccer, n2_s is the number of students playing soccer and one other sport but not all three, and n3 is the number of students playing all three sports.\n\nSimilarly for basketball and volleyball.\n\nBut this would require additional variables and might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express n1 in terms of n2 and n3 and substitute back.\n\nFrom equation 1: n1 = 30 - n2 - n3\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n(30 - n2 - n3) + 2n2 + 3n3 = 60 \u21d2 30 + n2 + 2n3 = 60 \u21d2 n2 + 2n3 = 30\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nThis suggests that with the current setup, we have only one equation with two variables, which isn't sufficient to find unique values for n2 and n3.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe there is additional information that can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume that there are no students playing exactly two sports, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, if n2 = 0, then n3 = 15 from the equation n2 + 2n3 = 30.\n\nBut n3 cannot be more than the number of students playing the sport with the fewest participants, which is soccer with 18 students.\n\nSo n3 \u2264 18.\n\n15 \u2264 18, so it's possible.\n\nBut we don't know if n2 is zero.\n\nAlternatively, if n3 = 0, then n2 = 30, but that would mean 30 students are playing exactly two sports, which is impossible because the total number of students is 30, but the sum of the sport participations would be n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 = 0 + 60 + 0 = 60, which matches the total participations.\n\nBut this doesn't violate any constraints, although it might not be the intended solution.\n\nHowever, the problem states that \"some students play all three sports,\" which suggests that n3 > 0.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there are multiple possible values for n3, but the problem seems to expect a single answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a way to determine n3 uniquely based on the numbers given.\n\nLet me consider the maximum possible value for n3.\n\nGiven that n3 cannot exceed the number of students in any single sport, and the smallest sport has 18 students, n3 \u2264 18.\n\nFrom the equation n2 + 2n3 = 30, and n2 \u2265 0, we have n3 \u2264 15.\n\nSo n3 \u2264 15.\n\nNow, let's check if n3 = 15 is possible.\n\nIf n3 = 15, then n2 = 30 - 30 = 0.\n\nThen n1 = 30 - 0 - 15 = 15.\n\nNow, check if this satisfies the number of students in each sport.\n\nStudents playing soccer: n1_s + n2_s + n3 = 18\n\nSimilarly for basketball and volleyball.\n\nBut n2_s = number of students playing exactly two sports involving soccer.\n\nSince n2 = 0, n2_s = 0.\n\nTherefore, students playing soccer: n1_s + 0 + 15 = 18 \u21d2 n1_s = 3\n\nSimilarly, for basketball:\n\nn1_b + 0 + 15 = 20 \u21d2 n1_b = 5\n\nFor volleyball:\n\nn1_v + 0 + 15 = 22 \u21d2 n1_v = 7\n\nNow, total n1 = n1_s + n1_b + n1_v = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, n2 = 0, n3 = 15.\n\nThis seems to be a valid solution.\n\nIs there another possible solution?\n\nSuppose n3 = 14.\n\nThen n2 = 30 - 28 = 2\n\nThen n1 = 30 - 2 - 14 = 14\n\nNow, check the number of students in each sport.\n\nSoccer: n1_s + n2_s + 14 = 18 \u21d2 n1_s + n2_s = 4\n\nBasketball: n1_b + n2_b + 14 = 20 \u21d2 n1_b + n2_b = 6\n\nVolleyball: n1_v + n2_v + 14 = 22 \u21d2 n1_v + n2_v = 8\n\nNow, n2 represents students playing exactly two sports, so n2 = n2_s + n2_b + n2_v = 2\n\nBut from above:\n\nn1_s + n2_s = 4\n\nn1_b + n2_b = 6\n\nn1_v + n2_v = 8\n\nAnd n2_s + n2_b + n2_v = 2\n\nWe need to find non-negative integer solutions for n1_s, n1_b, n1_v, n2_s, n2_b, n2_v such that:\n\nn1_s + n2_s = 4\n\nn1_b + n2_b = 6\n\nn1_v + n2_v = 8\n\nn2_s + n2_b + n2_v = 2\n\nAnd n1_s + n1_b + n1_v = 14\n\nFrom the first three equations:\n\nn1_s = 4 - n2_s\n\nn1_b = 6 - n2_b\n\nn1_v = 8 - n2_v\n\nSubstitute into the fourth equation:\n\n(4 - n2_s) + (6 - n2_b) + (8 - n2_v) = 14\n\n18 - (n2_s + n2_b + n2_v) = 14 \u21d2 18 - 2 = 16 \u2260 14\n\nWait, there's an inconsistency here.\n\nWait, n2_s + n2_b + n2_v = 2, so:\n\n18 - 2 = 16, but it should equal 14.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, n3 = 14 is not possible.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n3 = 13.\n\nThen n2 = 30 - 26 = 4\n\nn1 = 30 - 4 - 13 = 13\n\nNow:\n\nSoccer: n1_s + n2_s + 13 = 18 \u21d2 n1_s + n2_s = 5\n\nBasketball: n1_b + n2_b + 13 = 20 \u21d2 n1_b + n2_b = 7\n\nVolleyball: n1_v + n2_v + 13 = 22 \u21d2 n1_v + n2_v = 9\n\nAnd n2_s + n2_b + n2_v = 4\n\nn1_s + n1_b + n1_v = 13\n\nSimilarly:\n\nn1_s = 5 - n2_s\n\nn1_b = 7 - n2_b\n\nn1_v = 9 - n2_v\n\nSum: (5 - n2_s) + (7 - n2_b) + (9 - n2_v) = 21 - (n2_s + n2_b + n2_v) = 21 - 4 = 17 \u2260 13\n\nAgain, a contradiction.\n\nSo n3 = 13 is not possible.\n\nContinuing this way, we can see that only n3 = 15 satisfies all the conditions without leading to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the number of students playing all three sports is 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
