        "content": "Let's see. Sarah has twice as many cats as dogs, and she has 18 pets in total. I need to find out how many dogs she has.\n\nOkay, so let's assign some variables. Let\u2019s say the number of dogs she has is D. Since she has twice as many cats as dogs, the number of cats would be 2D.\n\nNow, the total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs and cats, right? So, D + 2D = 18.\n\nThat simplifies to 3D = 18.\n\nTo find D, I can divide both sides by 3. So, D = 18 / 3 = 6.\n\nTherefore, Sarah has 6 dogs.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If she has 6 dogs, then she has twice as many cats, which would be 12 cats. Total pets are 6 + 12 = 18, which matches the total given.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]\n"
