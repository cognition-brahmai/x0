        "content": "No, not all bats are blood-sucking vampires. In fact, only a small percentage of bat species engage in blood-feeding, a behavior known as hematophagy. There are over 1,400 species of bats worldwide, and only three species are true hematophagous bats: the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), the white-winged vampire bat (Diaemus youngi), and the hairy-legged vampire bat (Diphylla ecaudata). These bats primarily feed on the blood of mammals and birds.\n\nThe majority of bat species have diverse diets that include insects, fruits, nectar, pollen, small animals, and even fish. For example, insectivorous bats play a crucial role in controlling insect populations, while fruit-eating bats help in seed dispersal and pollination.\n\nIt's important to dispel the myth that all bats are dangerous or carry diseases. While it's true that some bats can carry rabies, the risk of contracting it from bats is relatively low. Most bats are harmless and play vital roles in ecosystems around the world."
