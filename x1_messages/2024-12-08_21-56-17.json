        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 12 socks in a drawer: 6 black and 6 white. The room is dark, so I can't see the colors. I need to figure out the minimum number of socks I must take out to ensure that I have at least one matching pair. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to have a matching pair. A matching pair would be two socks of the same color, either both black or both white. The goal is to find the smallest number of socks I need to take out to make sure that among them, there are at least two of the same color.\n\nI should consider the worst-case scenario to ensure that I have at least one matching pair. What's the worst that could happen? Well, I could pick one black sock and one white sock in my first two picks. That means I have one of each color, but no matching pair yet.\n\nSo, if I pick a third sock, it has to be either black or white. If it's black, then I have two black socks, which is a matching pair. If it's white, I have two white socks, which is also a matching pair. Therefore, by picking three socks, I am guaranteed to have at least one matching pair.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If I pick two socks, it's possible to have one black and one white, without a matching pair. But picking a third sock forces me to have two of the same color, because there are only two colors available.\n\nIs there a way to ensure a matching pair by picking fewer than three socks? Well, if I pick only one sock, I have just one sock, which isn't a pair at all. If I pick two socks, as I thought earlier, I could have one of each color, so no guarantee of a matching pair. Therefore, three is indeed the minimum number of socks I need to pick to ensure at least one matching pair.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that there are more socks in the drawer. There are 12 socks: 6 black and 6 white. But actually, the exact numbers might not matter for this particular problem, as long as there are at least two socks of each color.\n\nLet me consider a smaller example to test my reasoning. Suppose there are 2 black socks and 2 white socks in the drawer. What's the minimum number of socks I need to pick to ensure at least one matching pair?\n\nIf I pick one sock, it could be either black or white. If I pick a second sock, it could be a different color, so no pair yet. If I pick a third sock, it must match one of the first two, because there are only two colors. So, again, three socks guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier conclusion. Therefore, in the original problem with 12 socks (6 black and 6 white), the minimum number of socks I need to pick to ensure at least one matching pair is three.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose I pick three socks. The possible combinations are:\n\n- All three are black.\n\n- All three are white.\n\n- Two black and one white.\n\n- Two white and one black.\n\nIn all these cases, there is at least one matching pair: either two black socks or two white socks.\n\nIf I pick only two socks, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Both black.\n\n- Both white.\n\n- One black and one white.\n\nIn this case, it's possible to have a matching pair, but not guaranteed, because I could have one of each color.\n\nTherefore, picking three socks ensures that there is at least one matching pair, while picking two does not guarantee it.\n\nI think this makes sense. So, the answer should be three socks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
