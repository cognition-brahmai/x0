        "content": "So there's this problem here. There's a group of 10 men and 15 women, so total 25 people. And we're supposed to find the probability that if we choose two people at random from this group, both of them are women.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how to calculate probabilities, especially when it comes to selecting items from a set without replacement. Since we're choosing two people and we care about both being women, it seems like a dependent event because the outcome of the first choice affects the second.\n\nLet me think about the basic formula for probability: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose any two people from the group of 25. And the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose two women from the 15 women available.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is using combinations, because the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter. It's just about who ends up being chosen, not the order.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 people out of 25 is \"25 choose 2\", which is calculated as 25! / (2! * (25-2)!), which simplifies to (25 * 24) / (2 * 1) = 300 / 2 = 150.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 women out of 15 is \"15 choose 2\", which is 15! / (2! * (15-2)! ) = (15 * 14) / (2 * 1) = 210 / 2 = 105.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both chosen people are women is 105 / 150.\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 15: 105 \u00f7 15 = 7, and 150 \u00f7 15 = 10. So, 7/10.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal ways to choose 2 from 25: 25 * 24 / 2 = 300 / 2 = 150. That seems correct.\n\nWays to choose 2 women from 15: 15 * 14 / 2 = 210 / 2 = 105. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 105 / 150 = 7/10 after simplifying. Alright.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of sequential probabilities.\n\nThe probability that the first person chosen is a woman is 15/25, since there are 15 women out of 25 people.\n\nThen, given that the first person chosen is a woman, there are now 14 women left and 24 people left in the group.\n\nSo, the probability that the second person chosen is also a woman is 14/24.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability of both events happening is (15/25) * (14/24).\n\nLet me calculate that: 15/25 = 3/5, and 14/24 = 7/12.\n\nSo, (3/5) * (7/12) = 21 / 60.\n\nSimplifying 21/60 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: 7/20.\n\nWait, now I get 7/20, but earlier I got 7/10. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense. Both methods should give the same result.\n\nLet me check where I went wrong.\n\nAh, I think I messed up the first method.\n\nLet me recalculate the total number of ways to choose 2 people from 25.\n\n25 choose 2 is indeed 25 * 24 / 2 = 300 / 2 = 150. That's correct.\n\nNow, 15 choose 2 for the women: 15 * 14 / 2 = 210 / 2 = 105. That's also correct.\n\nSo, probability should be 105 / 150 = 7/10.\n\nBut using the sequential method, I get (15/25) * (14/24) = (3/5) * (7/12) = 21/60 = 7/20.\n\nWhy the difference?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the first method.\n\nIs the total number of ways to choose 2 people from 25 really 150?\n\nLet me verify:\n\nCombination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)! )\n\nSo, C(25, 2) = 25! / (2! * 23!) = (25 * 24) / (2 * 1) = 600 / 2 = 300 / 1 = 300.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 25 * 24 = 600, divided by 2 is 300.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 150. Did I divide by 2 twice or something?\n\nNo, wait, 25 choose 2 is indeed 300.\n\nSimilarly, 15 choose 2 is (15 * 14) / 2 = 210 / 1 = 210.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, 15 choose 2 is (15 * 14) / (2 * 1) = 210 / 2 = 105. That's what I got earlier.\n\nBut 25 choose 2 is (25 * 24) / 2 = 600 / 2 = 300.\n\nSo, probability is 105 / 300.\n\nSimplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 15: 105 \u00f7 15 = 7, 300 \u00f7 15 = 20. So, 7/20.\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong. In my first approach, I mistakenly calculated 25 choose 2 as 150, but it's actually 300.\n\nSo, correcting that, the total number of ways is 300, and the number of favorable ways is 105, so 105/300 = 7/20.\n\nThat matches the sequential method.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability is 7/20.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages to understand it better.\n\n7/20 is equal to 0.35, or 35%.\n\nSo, there's a 35% chance that both chosen people are women.\n\nAlternatively, using the sequential method:\n\nProbability first person is a woman: 15/25 = 3/5 = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nGiven that, probability second person is a woman: 14/24 = 7/12 \u2248 0.5833 or 58.33%.\n\nSo, 60% chance for the first, and then 58.33% chance for the second, giving approximately 35% overall chance that both are women.\n\nThis makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to use the formula for probability of independent events, but in this case, since we're choosing without replacement, they're not independent events.\n\nThe first choice affects the second.\n\nHence, the sequential method makes more sense here.\n\nBut I also need to be careful with my combination calculations to ensure I'm not making mistakes in counting.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Total number of ways to choose 2 people from 25: C(25,2) = 300.\n\n- Number of ways to choose 2 women from 15: C(15,2) = 105.\n\n- Therefore, probability = 105 / 300 = 7/20.\n\nAlternatively, sequential probability:\n\n- P(first woman) = 15/25 = 3/5.\n\n- P(second woman | first woman) = 14/24 = 7/12.\n\n- Therefore, P(both women) = (3/5) * (7/12) = 21/60 = 7/20.\n\nBoth methods confirm the answer is 7/20.\n\nI think that's the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{20}} \\]"
