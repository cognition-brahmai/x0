Here's the information you requested about three different lighthouses in YAML format:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Eddystone Lighthouse\n  location: off the coast of Devon, England\n  year_built: 1698 (original structure)\n  height: 49 meters (current structure)\n  history: The Eddystone Lighthouse is located on a hazardous rock formation off the coast of Devon, England. The current lighthouse is the fourth to occupy the site, with previous structures being destroyed by fire and storm damage. The first lighthouse was built in 1698 by Henry Winstanley but was lost in the Great Storm of 1703. The second, designed by John Rudyerd, was completed in 1709 but collapsed in 1755. The third, designed by John Smeaton, was completed in 1759 and was the first lighthouse to be built on a rock foundation using granite blocks. It became a model for future lighthouse construction. The current lighthouse, designed by James Douglass, was built in 1874 and is still in operation today.\n\n- name: Pharos of Alexandria\n  location: Alexandria, Egypt\n  year_built: around 280 BC\n  height: approximately 117 meters\n  history: The Pharos of Alexandria was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Built on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt, it was commissioned by Ptolemy II Philadelphus and designed by the Greek architect Sostratus of Cnidus. The lighthouse stood for many centuries, guiding ships into the harbor of Alexandria. It was damaged by earthquakes several times and finally fell into ruin in the 14th century AD. Its remains were used to build the Citadel of Qaitbay in the 15th century.\n\n- name: Tour de Cordouan\n  location: off the Atlantic coast of France\n  year_built: 1584\n  height: 67 meters\n  history: The Tour de Cordouan is the oldest operating lighthouse in France and is located at the mouth of the Gironde estuary. It was designed by Louis de Foix and took over 30 years to build, from 1584 to 1611. The lighthouse is known for its elegant Renaissance architecture and is often referred to as the \"Pearl of the Antilles.\" It has been in continuous operation since its construction, with its light visible for over 20 miles out to sea. The lighthouse has been upgraded and modified several times over the centuries, but its original structure remains intact.\n```\n\nI hope this information helps! Let me know if you need any further details."
