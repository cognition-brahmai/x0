        "content": "Let's see. So, in this election, candidate A got 60% of the votes and candidate B got 40%. And candidate A won by 5000 votes. I need to find out the total number of votes cast in the election.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means that candidate A won by 5000 votes. I think that means candidate A had 5000 more votes than candidate B.\n\nSo, if total votes cast are, let's say, V, then candidate A received 60% of V, which is 0.6V, and candidate B received 40% of V, which is 0.4V.\n\nThe difference between A's votes and B's votes is 0.6V - 0.4V = 0.2V.\n\nAnd this difference is given as 5000 votes. So, 0.2V = 5000.\n\nNow, I can solve for V.\n\nV = 5000 / 0.2\n\nV = 25,000\n\nSo, the total votes cast in the election were 25,000.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nIf V is 25,000, then A got 60% of 25,000, which is 15,000 votes, and B got 40% of 25,000, which is 10,000 votes. The difference is indeed 5,000 votes.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of percentages.\n\nThe difference between A and B's percentages is 20% (60% - 40%), and that corresponds to 5,000 votes.\n\nSo, 20% of total votes = 5,000\n\nTherefore, total votes V = 5,000 / 20% = 5,000 / 0.2 = 25,000\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think this is right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25000} \\]"
