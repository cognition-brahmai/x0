        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the factory produces 250 units of product A every 4 hours. We need to find out how many units it will produce in 3 days.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many hours there are in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, I can multiply 24 by 3:\n\n24 hours/day \u00d7 3 days = 72 hours\n\nSo, in 3 days, there are 72 hours.\n\nNext, I know that the factory produces 250 units every 4 hours. To find out how many 4-hour intervals there are in 72 hours, I can divide 72 by 4:\n\n72 hours \u00f7 4 hours/unit period = 18 periods\n\nThat means there are 18 periods of 4 hours in 72 hours.\n\nNow, since the factory produces 250 units in each 4-hour period, I can find the total production by multiplying the number of periods by the production per period:\n\n18 periods \u00d7 250 units/period = 4,500 units\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 4,500 units in 3 days.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning:\n\n- Production rate: 250 units every 4 hours\n\n- Total time: 3 days\n\nConvert days to hours: 3 days \u00d7 24 hours/day = 72 hours\n\nNumber of 4-hour periods in 72 hours: 72 \u00f7 4 = 18\n\nTotal units produced: 18 \u00d7 250 = 4,500 units\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the hourly production rate and then multiply by the total hours.\n\nFirst, find the production rate per hour:\n\n250 units / 4 hours = 62.5 units/hour\n\nThen, total units in 72 hours:\n\n62.5 units/hour \u00d7 72 hours = 4,500 units\n\nSame answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the daily production.\n\nFirst, find the number of 4-hour periods in a day:\n\n24 hours/day \u00f7 4 hours/per period = 6 periods/day\n\nProduction per day: 6 periods/day \u00d7 250 units/period = 1,500 units/day\n\nOver 3 days: 3 days \u00d7 1,500 units/day = 4,500 units\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that 4,500 units is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4500} \\]"
