        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical tank filled with water, and we need to figure out how long it'll take to empty it when the water is being pumped out at a certain rate. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder because the tank is cylindrical. The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nFrom the problem, the radius \\( r \\) is 2 meters, and the height \\( h \\) is 5 meters. So, plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi (2)^2 (5) = \\pi \\times 4 \\times 5 = 20\\pi \\text{ cubic meters}\n\\]\n\nNow, the water is being pumped out at a rate of 0.5 cubic meters per minute. To find out how long it will take to empty the entire tank, I need to divide the total volume of the water by the pumping rate.\n\nSo, the time \\( t \\) in minutes will be:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{V}{\\text{pumping rate}} = \\frac{20\\pi}{0.5} \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this, we have:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{20\\pi}{0.5} = 40\\pi \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, since \\( \\pi \\) is approximately 3.1416, we can calculate this as:\n\n\\[\nt \\approx 40 \\times 3.1416 = 125.664 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether to leave the answer in terms of \\( \\pi \\) or to compute a numerical value. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says \"how long will it take to empty the tank completely?\" and doesn't specify the form of the answer. It might be acceptable to leave it in terms of \\( \\pi \\), but probably giving a numerical value would be more practical.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider, like the shape of the tank or anything else that might affect the pumping rate. But in this problem, it seems straightforward: the pumping rate is constant at 0.5 cubic meters per minute, and the tank is fully filled.\n\nWait a minute, is the pumping rate constant? The problem says \"pumped out at a rate of 0.5 cubic meters per minute.\" That sounds constant. So, no need to worry about variable rates.\n\nAlso, is there any loss due to the pumping process, like friction or something? The problem doesn't mention any losses, so I'll assume that all the water pumped out is effectively removed from the tank.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the units. The volume is in cubic meters, and the rate is in cubic meters per minute, which matches, so the time will be in minutes, which is fine.\n\nSo, the calculation seems straightforward: volume divided by the rate gives the time.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about the volume again. The volume of a cylinder is indeed \\( \\pi r^2 h \\), and we've used the given dimensions correctly.\n\nNow, if I were to double-check the calculation:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi \\times (2)^2 \\times 5 = \\pi \\times 4 \\times 5 = 20\\pi \\text{ m}^3\n\\]\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{20\\pi}{0.5} = 40\\pi \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I calculate it numerically:\n\n\\[\nt = 40 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 125.664 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nRounding it to a reasonable number of decimal places, perhaps two decimal places would be sufficient, so 125.66 minutes.\n\nBut, in some contexts, it might be useful to express it in hours and minutes. Let's see:\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n\\[\n125.664 \\div 60 = 2.094 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nWhich is 2 hours and approximately 0.094 \\times 60 = 5.64 minutes, so roughly 2 hours and 5.6 minutes.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the form of the answer, I'll stick with the numerical value in minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of \\( \\pi \\). Let me see.\n\nThe problem is: \"how long will it take to empty the tank completely?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify to use numerical approximation for \\( \\pi \\), so maybe leaving it as \\( 40\\pi \\) minutes is acceptable.\n\nIn fact, in some scientific contexts, leaving \\( \\pi \\) as is without approximation is preferred for exactness.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is \\( 40\\pi \\) minutes.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the context. This seems like a practical problem about pumping water, so a numerical value might be more useful in practice.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify, both answers are technically correct, but perhaps the exact form \\( 40\\pi \\) is preferred in a mathematical context.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \\( \\pi \\) is approximately 3.14, then \\( 40 \\times 3.14 = 125.6 \\) minutes, which is the same as our earlier calculation.\n\nBut to be precise, using \\( \\pi \\) avoids rounding errors.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is \\( 40\\pi \\) minutes.\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\pi \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
