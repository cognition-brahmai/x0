        "content": "Yes, drinking alcohol can kill brain cells. Alcohol is a toxin that can damage brain cells and interfere with their normal functioning. Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to a condition called alcoholic dementia, which is characterized by memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with problem-solving and decision-making. Even moderate alcohol consumption can have negative effects on the brain, including impaired cognitive function and reduced brain volume. It's important to drink responsibly and in moderation to minimize the risk of alcohol-related brain damage."
