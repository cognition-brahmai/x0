As I sit down to write to you, a thousand thoughts and emotions swirl in my mind, but mostly, there's an overwhelming feeling of missing you. It's been too long since I've held you in my arms, too long since I've felt your lips on mine, too long since I've heard your laughter fill the room.\n\nRemember that old caf\u00e9 we used to frequent back in college? The one with the worn-out leather seats and the walls adorned with abstract art? I was sitting there just yesterday, sipping on a cup of coffee that tasted bland without you by my side. The barista even commented on how different it was without both of us there. It felt odd, to say the least. That place holds so many memories for us\u2014late-night study sessions, first dates, and endless conversations about our dreams and fears.\n\nDo you recall the time we got lost during that road trip? We were supposed to reach the beach by sunset, but instead, we ended up in some tiny village surrounded by fields of lavender. The air was filled with the sweet scent, and the sky was painted in hues of orange and pink. We laughed at our misadventure and decided to make a picnic right there, under the open sky. It was one of the most beautiful moments of my life, all thanks to our detour. I miss those spontaneous adventures we used to have, the way we could turn any situation into an adventure.\n\nI often think about the future, about the life we'll build together when distance is no longer between us. I see us walking hand in hand along the beach, watching the sunrise, maybe even starting a family. But more than that, I envision us continuing to explore the world, to learn from each other, to grow old together, still in love and still dreaming big dreams.\n\nIn the meantime, I hold onto the memories we've made and the promises we've shared. Every picture, every letter, every video call is a treasure to me. They keep you alive in my heart and mind, even when miles separate us. I cherish every moment we've spent together, no matter how small or big.\n\nI miss your smile, your warmth, your wit. I miss the way you look at me like I'm the only person in the world that matters to you. I miss the comfort of your presence, the security of knowing you're always there, even if it's just through words and pictures.\n\nPlease know that no matter how far apart we are, my heart is always with you. I am committed to making this relationship work, to overcoming the obstacles that distance presents. I promise to be patient, understanding, and supportive, just as you have been for me.\n\nUntil we are reunited, know that you are loved more than words can express. I can't wait for the day when I can hold you again, when I can tell you these things face to face, when I can show you how much you mean to me.\n\nWith all my love,\n\nPeter\n"
