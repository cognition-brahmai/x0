        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a group of 20 people, and it says that 8 people wear glasses, 9 wear hats, and 5 wear both glasses and hats. I need to find out how many people don't wear either glasses or hats. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. That's the formula where you add the number of people wearing glasses and the number wearing hats, and then subtract the number wearing both because they've been counted twice. So, the total number of people wearing either glasses or hats or both would be:\n\nNumber wearing glasses + number wearing hats - number wearing both.\n\nSo, that's 8 + 9 - 5 = 12 people.\n\nNow, since there are 20 people in total, the number who don't wear either would be 20 - 12 = 8 people.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there another way to look at this?\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of sets. Let's say set G is the set of people wearing glasses, and set H is the set of people wearing hats. We're given:\n\n- |G| = 8\n\n- |H| = 9\n\n- |G \u2229 H| = 5\n\nWe need to find the number of people not in G or H, which is the complement of G union H.\n\nSo, the number of people wearing either glasses or hats or both is |G \u222a H|.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|G \u222a H| = |G| + |H| - |G \u2229 H| = 8 + 9 - 5 = 12.\n\nThen, the number of people not wearing either is the total number minus those wearing something, which is 20 - 12 = 8.\n\nHmm, that matches my first answer. Maybe I'm good here.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlapping or other factors I might have missed. For example, are there people who might be wearing something else, like scarves or shoes, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I think that's irrelevant.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the numbers make sense: 8 wear glasses, 9 wear hats, 5 wear both. So, the number wearing only glasses would be 8 - 5 = 3, only hats would be 9 - 5 = 4, and both is 5. Adding those up: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, 20 - 12 = 8 people not wearing either.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the whole set, it's like:\n\nTotal people = people wearing only glasses + only hats + both + neither.\n\nSo, 20 = (8 - 5) + (9 - 5) + 5 + neither.\n\nThat is, 20 = 3 + 4 + 5 + neither.\n\nAdding up the numbers: 3 + 4 = 7, plus 5 is 12, so 20 - 12 = 8.\n\nYeah, seems consistent.\n\nMaybe I can also visualize this with a Venn diagram in my mind. There are two circles overlapping. One circle for glasses, one for hats. The overlap is 5 people who wear both.\n\nSo, glasses only would be 8 - 5 = 3, hats only 9 - 5 = 4, both 5, and outside the circles would be those who don't wear either, which is 8.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer in multiple ways, and it consistently comes up to 8 people not wearing glasses or hats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
