        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. There are 8 boys and 12 girls in a classroom, making a total of 20 students. We need to select 4 students at random to form a committee, and we want to find the probability that exactly 2 boys and 2 girls are chosen.\n\nFirst things first, I know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 students out of 20 would be the combination of 20 students taken 4 at a time. Combinations are used here because the order in which we select the students doesn't matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 4 students out of 20 is:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 4) = \\frac{20!}{4!(20 - 4)!} = \\frac{20!}{4! \\times 16!}\n\\]\n\nI don't need to calculate this right away; I'll keep it like this for now.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is selecting exactly 2 boys and 2 girls. Since there are 8 boys and 12 girls, the number of ways to choose 2 boys out of 8 is:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 12 is:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!}\n\\]\n\nSince these are independent events (choosing boys and choosing girls), the total number of favorable ways to choose 2 boys and 2 girls is the product of these two combinations:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) \\times C(12, 2)\n\\]\n\nNow, the probability \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{C(8, 2) \\times C(12, 2)}{C(20, 4)}\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I need to compute these combinations. Let's start with \\( C(8, 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( C(12, 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( C(20, 4) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(20, 4) = \\frac{20!}{4! \\times 16!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16!}{24 \\times 16!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17}{24}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 19 = 380 \\\\\n380 \\times 18 = 6840 \\\\\n6840 \\times 17 = 116280\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by 24:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{116280}{24} = 4845\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( C(20, 4) = 4845 \\)\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) \\times C(12, 2) = 28 \\times 66 = 1848\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1848}{4845}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction. Let's see if 1848 and 4845 have any common factors. First, I can check if both are divisible by 3.\n\nAdding the digits of 1848: 1 + 8 + 4 + 8 = 21, which is divisible by 3.\n\nAdding the digits of 4845: 4 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 21, which is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo, divide both numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1848 \\div 3}{4845 \\div 3} = \\frac{616}{1615}\n\\]\n\nNow, check if 616 and 1615 have any common factors. Let's see if they are divisible by 7.\n\n616 divided by 7 is 88, since 7 \u00d7 80 = 560, and 7 \u00d7 8 = 56, so 560 + 56 = 616.\n\nNow, check if 1615 is divisible by 7. 7 \u00d7 230 = 1610, and 1610 + 5 = 1615, which is not divisible by 7 (since 7 \u00d7 230 = 1610, and 1615 - 1610 = 5, which is not a multiple of 7). So, no common factor of 7.\n\nNext, check for divisibility by 2. 616 is even, but 1615 is odd, so no common factor of 2.\n\nCheck for divisibility by 5. 616 does not end with 0 or 5, so no common factor of 5.\n\nCheck for divisibility by 11. For 616, 6 + 6 = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11, which is divisible by 11. So, 616 \u00f7 11 = 56.\n\nFor 1615, check if it's divisible by 11: 1 - 6 + 1 - 5 = -9, which is not divisible by 11. So, no common factor of 11.\n\nCheck for divisibility by 13. 13 \u00d7 47 = 611, which is less than 616, and 13 \u00d7 48 = 624, which is greater than 616, so 616 is not divisible by 13.\n\nCheck for divisibility by 17. 17 \u00d7 36 = 612, which is less than 616, and 17 \u00d7 37 = 629, which is greater, so no.\n\nCheck for divisibility by 19. 19 \u00d7 32 = 608, and 608 + 8 = 616, so 616 \u00f7 19 = 32.42, which is not an integer. So, no.\n\nSince 616 and 1615 don't have any common factors other than 1, the fraction \\(\\frac{616}{1615}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly 2 boys and 2 girls will be chosen is \\(\\frac{616}{1615}\\).\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a better sense of it.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{616}{1615} \\approx 0.3812\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 38.12%.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, \\( C(8, 2) = 28 \\), that seems correct.\n\n\\( C(12, 2) = 66 \\), that also seems correct.\n\n\\( C(20, 4) = 4845 \\), I think that's right too.\n\nThen, \\( 28 \\times 66 = 1848 \\), and \\( \\frac{1848}{4845} = \\frac{616}{1615} \\), and the decimal is approximately 0.3812.\n\nHmm, another way to approach this is to use the formula for hypergeometric distribution, since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\frac{C(K, k) \\times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the population size (20 students),\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (8 boys, or alternatively 12 girls),\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of draws (4 students),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (2 boys).\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\frac{C(8, 2) \\times C(12, 2)}{C(20, 4)} = \\frac{28 \\times 66}{4845} = \\frac{1848}{4845} = \\frac{616}{1615} \\approx 0.3812\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it step by step, considering the probability of selecting a boy or a girl at each step, but that might be more complicated without any advantage.\n\nSo, I think \\(\\frac{616}{1615}\\) or approximately 38.12% is the correct probability of selecting exactly 2 boys and 2 girls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{616}{1615}} \\]"
