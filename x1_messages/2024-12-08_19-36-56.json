        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacing the first one, both of them are red.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember how probability works. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is picking two red balls. So, I need to figure out how many ways I can pick two red balls from the 4 available, and then divide that by the total number of ways I can pick any two balls from the entire bag of 10 balls.\n\nI think I should use combinations here because the order in which I pick the balls doesn't matter. It's just about which balls I end up with, not the sequence in which I picked them.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 4 is denoted as C(4,2), and the total number of ways to choose any 2 balls from 10 is C(10,2).\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate C(4,2):\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to choose 2 red balls from 4.\n\nNext, I'll calculate C(10,2):\n\nC(10,2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 ways to choose any 2 balls from 10.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is 6/45.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: 6 \u00f7 3 = 2, and 45 \u00f7 3 = 15. So, it's 2/15.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities step by step, considering that the first pick affects the second pick since there's no replacement.\n\nAlright, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw.\n\nThere are 4 red balls out of 10 total balls, so the probability is 4/10.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, there are now 3 red balls left and a total of 9 balls remaining in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is 3/9.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I need to multiply the probabilities of each step.\n\nSo, (4/10) \u00d7 (3/9) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (10 \u00d7 9) = 12 / 90.\n\nSimplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 6: 12 \u00f7 6 = 2, and 90 \u00f7 6 = 15. So again, 2/15.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Suppose I think about the total number of red balls and the total number of balls.\n\nInitially, the probability of picking a red ball first is 4/10.\n\nGiven that the first ball was red, the probability of the second ball being red is then 3/9.\n\nMultiplying them gives me the joint probability, which is 2/15, matching my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the order matters, but since I'm picking without replacement, I need to make sure I'm accounting for that.\n\nWait, in my first approach, I used combinations because order doesn't matter. In the second approach, I considered the sequence of picks, but the final probability should be the same because the combination approach inherently accounts for all possible sequences.\n\nIndeed, it does, and both methods converge to the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can calculate the probability using permutations instead of combinations and see if I get the same result.\n\nUsing permutations, the number of ways to pick 2 red balls in order would be P(4,2), and the total number of ways to pick any 2 balls in order would be P(10,2).\n\nThe formula for permutations is P(n,k) = n! / (n-k)!.\n\nSo, P(4,2) = 4! / (4-2)! = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nP(10,2) = 10! / (10-2)! = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nSo, the probability would be 12/90, which simplifies to 2/15 again.\n\nPerfect, all three methods give me the same answer, which gives me confidence that 2/15 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me just double-check if I'm missing anything. Is there any scenario where the order would matter, or any other factors that could affect the probability?\n\nWell, since the problem states that the balls are picked without replacement, and it's just about the final composition of the two balls picked, order shouldn't matter.\n\nAlso, the balls are randomly picked, so each ball has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nI don't think there are any hidden variables or additional constraints in this problem.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the probability of picking two red balls without replacement is 2/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{15}} \\]"
