        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden that measures 15 meters in length and 8 meters in width. The gardener wants to plant flowers along the entire perimeter of the garden, and there should be 1 meter between each flower. We need to figure out how many flowers are required for this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the perimeter of a rectangle is. The perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for the perimeter (P) is:\n\nP = 2 * (length + width)\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nP = 2 * (15 meters + 8 meters) = 2 * 23 meters = 46 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter of the garden is 46 meters.\n\nNow, the gardener wants to plant flowers along this 46-meter perimeter, with each flower placed 1 meter apart from the next. At first glance, it might seem like you just divide the perimeter by the spacing between flowers to get the number of flowers. So, 46 meters divided by 1 meter per flower would suggest 46 flowers.\n\nHowever, we need to consider whether this calculation accounts for the way flowers are placed at the corners. In a rectangular shape, the corners might require a bit more thought because the perimeter changes direction at each corner.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Imagine starting at one corner and placing the first flower there. Then, every 1 meter along the perimeter, another flower is placed. So, from the first corner to the next corner, along the length of 15 meters, there would be flowers at 0 meters, 1 meter, 2 meters, ..., up to 15 meters. That's 16 flowers along one length (including the starting corner).\n\nSimilarly, along the width of 8 meters, from one corner to the next, there would be flowers at 0 meters, 1 meter, 2 meters, ..., up to 8 meters. That's 9 flowers along one width (including the corner flower already counted in the length).\n\nNow, if we do this for all four sides:\n\n- Two lengths: 16 flowers each, but the corner flowers are shared with the widths.\n\n- Two widths: 9 flowers each, again with corner flowers shared.\n\nSo, total flowers would be:\n\n(2 * 16) + (2 * 9) - 4\n\nWe subtract 4 because the four corner flowers are counted twice, once in each pair of sides that meet at the corner.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(32) + (18) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 flowers\n\nWait a minute, that matches the initial straightforward calculation. So, in this case, both methods give us the same answer: 46 flowers.\n\nBut let's double-check this. Another way to look at it is to consider that the number of flowers is equal to the number of 1-meter intervals along the perimeter. Since the perimeter is 46 meters, and flowers are spaced 1 meter apart, it should indeed be 46 flowers.\n\nHowever, sometimes in such problems, there can be confusion about whether to count the starting point again at the end. In a closed loop like a rectangle, the first and last flowers would be at the same point if you go all the way around. But in this scenario, since we're leaving 1 meter between each flower, and the perimeter is exactly 46 meters, placing 46 flowers each 1 meter apart should cover the entire perimeter without overlapping.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I start at a corner and place the first flower, then every 1 meter along the perimeter, I place another flower. After placing the 46th flower, I should be back at the starting point, but since the perimeter is exactly 46 meters, the 46th flower would be at the starting point, effectively overlapping with the first flower.\n\nBut in reality, if we're planting physical flowers, we can't have two flowers in the same spot. So, perhaps we need to adjust for that. Maybe we should only plant 46 flowers, with the last flower being 1 meter before the starting point, and not planting one at the starting point again.\n\nWait, that might be unnecessary confusion. Since the perimeter is exactly 46 meters and flowers are spaced 1 meter apart, 46 flowers would be needed, with the last flower being at the starting point, effectively closing the loop.\n\nBut in terms of actual planting, if you start at a point and place flowers every 1 meter around the perimeter, by the time you place the 46th flower, it will be at the starting point. So, you've covered the entire perimeter with 46 flowers, each 1 meter apart.\n\nTherefore, the gardener will need 46 flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{46} \\]"
