The most well-known satellite is Earth's Moon, but planets can have multiple natural satellites. For example, Jupiter and Saturn have numerous moons of varying sizes. In addition to natural satellites, there are also artificial satellites, which are human-made objects placed in orbit around planets for various purposes such as communication, Earth observation, and scientific research."
