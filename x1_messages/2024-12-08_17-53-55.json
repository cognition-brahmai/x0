        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 20 red balls and 30 blue balls, making a total of 50 balls. I need to find out the probability of picking a red ball twice in a row, with replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is picking a red ball twice in a row.\n\nSince the ball is replaced after each pick, each pick is independent of the other. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the outcome of the second pick. So, I can calculate the probability of each event separately and then multiply them together to get the overall probability.\n\nLet's start with the first pick. The probability of picking a red ball on the first try is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, that's 20 red balls out of 50 total balls. So, the probability is 20/50, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNow, since I'm replacing the ball, the total number of balls remains the same for the second pick. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second pick is also 20/50, or 2/5.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together (picking a red ball twice in a row), I multiply the probabilities of each event. So, that's (2/5) * (2/5).\n\nLet me calculate that. 2/5 times 2/5 is 4/25.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball twice in a row is 4/25.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer?\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the sample space for two picks with replacement. Since each pick is independent, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of outcomes for the first pick multiplied by the number of outcomes for the second pick.\n\nIn this case, each pick has 50 possible outcomes (since there are 50 balls), so the total number of possible outcomes for two picks is 50 * 50 = 2500.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick a red ball on the first pick and a red ball on the second pick.\n\nSince there are 20 red balls, the number of ways to pick a red ball on the first pick is 20, and similarly, 20 for the second pick. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 20 * 20 = 400.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 400 / 2500. Simplifying that fraction, 400 divided by 2500 is 4/25.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any dependency between the picks, even though it's with replacement? The problem says the ball is put back, so the conditions remain the same for each pick.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the balls are indistinguishable except for their color, which seems to be the case here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for independent events: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).\n\nHere, event A is picking a red ball on the first pick, and event B is picking a red ball on the second pick. Since they are independent, their probabilities multiply.\n\nI've already calculated P(A) = 2/5 and P(B) = 2/5, so P(A and B) = (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nJust for extra clarity, I can also consider the decimal or percentage form of this probability.\n\n4/25 is equal to 0.16, or 16%.\n\nSo, there's a 16% chance of picking a red ball twice in a row with replacement.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other perspective I should look at this from. For example, what if it was without replacement? But the problem specifies with replacement, so I don't need to go there, but it's good to know that if it was without replacement, the probabilities would change for the second pick.\n\nBut in this case, it's with replacement, so the probability remains the same for each pick.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability is indeed 4/25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}} \\]"
