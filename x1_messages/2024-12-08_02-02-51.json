        "content": "I'm happy to help you with that! Here are five different types of poetry, each with a brief description and an example:\n\n1. **Sonnet**\n   - **Description:** A sonnet is a 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme. It often explores themes of love and beauty. There are two main types: the Shakespearean sonnet and the Petrarchan sonnet.\n   - **Example (Shakespearean Sonnet):**\n     ```\n     Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\n     Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\n     Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\n     And summer's lease hath all too short a date:\n     ```\n\n2. **Haiku**\n   - **Description:** Haiku is a traditional Japanese poetry form consisting of three lines. The first and last lines contain five syllables, and the middle line has seven syllables. Haiku often captures a moment in nature.\n   - **Example:**\n     ```\n     An old silent pond...\n     A frog jumps into the pond\u2014\n     Splash! Silence again.\n     ```\n\n3. **Free Verse**\n   - **Description:** Free verse poetry does not follow a specific format or rhyme scheme. It allows poets to express their thoughts and feelings in a more natural, conversational manner.\n   - **Example:**\n     ```\n     I have heard\n     there are springs\n     far in the desert\n     I have heard\n     that trees\n     grow there too\n     ```\n\n4. **Limerick**\n   - **Description:** A limerick is a five-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme (AABBA). It often contains humorous or nonsensical content.\n   - **Example:**\n     ```\n     There once was a man from Nantucket\n     Who kept all his cash in a bucket;\n     But his daughter, named Nan,\n     Ran away with a man,\n     And as for the bucket, Nantucket.\n     ```\n\n5. **Ballad**\n   - **Description:** Ballads are narrative poems that tell a story, often with a repetitive chorus. They were traditionally meant to be sung and often deal with folk tales or legends.\n   - **Example:**\n     ```\n     Oh, the night was dark and the wind was cold,\n     As we sailed across the foam,\n     And the Mary Ellen Carter was a gallant ship,\n     But she\u2019s lying at the bottom now, and the sea runs over her tomb.\n     ```\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
