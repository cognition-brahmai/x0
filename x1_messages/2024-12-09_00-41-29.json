Each apartment has an area of 1000 square feet, and the cost of construction is $150 per square foot. The company also needs to build parking spaces for residents, with one space per apartment. Each parking space requires an additional 200 square feet and costs $50 per square foot. Calculate the total cost of constructing the residential complex and parking spaces. Additionally, estimate the selling price per apartment if the company wants to make a 20% profit."

        "content": "Let's break down this problem step by step. We have a construction company building a residential complex with 500 apartments, each being 1000 square feet, and the construction cost is $150 per square foot. Additionally, there are parking spaces, one for each apartment, each requiring 200 square feet at $50 per square foot. We need to calculate the total construction cost and then estimate the selling price per apartment to achieve a 20% profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the construction cost for the apartments.\n\nEach apartment is 1000 square feet, and there are 500 apartments, so the total area for apartments is:\n\n500 apartments * 1000 sq ft/apartment = 500,000 sq ft\n\nAt $150 per square foot, the cost for apartments is:\n\n500,000 sq ft * $150/sq ft = $75,000,000\n\nNext, let's calculate the construction cost for the parking spaces.\n\nEach parking space is 200 square feet, and there are 500 spaces (one per apartment), so the total area for parking is:\n\n500 spaces * 200 sq ft/space = 100,000 sq ft\n\nAt $50 per square foot, the cost for parking is:\n\n100,000 sq ft * $50/sq ft = $5,000,000\n\nNow, let's add the costs for apartments and parking to get the total construction cost:\n\n$75,000,000 (apartments) + $5,000,000 (parking) = $80,000,000\n\nSo, the total construction cost is $80,000,000.\n\nNow, to estimate the selling price per apartment for a 20% profit, we first need to determine the total desired revenue.\n\nA 20% profit on the construction cost means:\n\nProfit = 20% of $80,000,000 = 0.20 * $80,000,000 = $16,000,000\n\nTherefore, the total desired revenue is:\n\nConstruction cost + Profit = $80,000,000 + $16,000,000 = $96,000,000\n\nSince there are 500 apartments, the selling price per apartment would be:\n\nTotal desired revenue / Number of apartments = $96,000,000 / 500 = $192,000 per apartment\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nTotal revenue needed: $96,000,000\n\nNumber of apartments: 500\n\nSelling price per apartment: $96,000,000 / 500 = $192,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could calculate the cost per apartment including profit and then see what the selling price should be.\n\nLet me try that approach as well.\n\nFirst, the construction cost per apartment:\n\nApartment construction: 1000 sq ft * $150/sq ft = $150,000\n\nParking space per apartment: 200 sq ft * $50/sq ft = $10,000\n\nTotal construction cost per apartment: $150,000 + $10,000 = $160,000\n\nNow, to achieve a 20% profit on the construction cost per apartment:\n\nProfit per apartment = 20% of $160,000 = 0.20 * $160,000 = $32,000\n\nTherefore, selling price per apartment = construction cost per apartment + profit per apartment = $160,000 + $32,000 = $192,000\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the selling price per apartment should be $192,000 to achieve a 20% profit.\n\nWait, but in real estate, sometimes other costs are considered, like land cost, permits, etc. But based on the information provided, we're only considering the construction cost of apartments and parking spaces.\n\nAlso, assuming that the profit is based on the construction cost only, not including other costs.\n\nSo, sticking with the calculations above.\n\nTotal construction cost: $80,000,000\n\nDesired profit: 20% of $80,000,000 = $16,000,000\n\nTotal revenue needed: $80,000,000 + $16,000,000 = $96,000,000\n\nSelling price per apartment: $96,000,000 / 500 = $192,000\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192000} \\]"
