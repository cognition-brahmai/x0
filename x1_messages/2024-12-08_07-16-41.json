        "content": "So I need to create a chatbot using Rasa that can answer questions about a specific topic, like sports or movies. And it should use natural language processing to understand what the user is asking and give proper answers back. Right?\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I have Rasa installed. Rasa is an open-source machine learning framework for building contextual AI assistants. It's written in Python, so I should have Python installed on my machine as well.\n\nI think I should start by installing Rasa. I can do that by running `pip install rasa` in my command line. Once that's done, I can create a new Rasa project using the command `rasa init`. This will set up a basic directory structure with some sample stories, intents, and domains.\n\nBut since I want my chatbot to be about a specific topic, like sports, I need to customize it accordingly. So, first, I should decide on the topic. Let's go with sports for this example.\n\nOkay, so my chatbot will be a sports information bot. Users can ask about scores, players, teams, etc., and the bot should provide relevant information.\n\nI need to define the intents that the bot will recognize. Intents are essentially the different types of questions or statements that the user might make. For a sports bot, some intents could be:\n\n- ask_score: when the user wants to know the score of a game\n\n- ask_player_stats: for statistics about a player\n\n- ask_team_info: for information about a team\n\n- ask_scheduled_games: to know what games are scheduled when\n\n- greet: when the user greets the bot\n\n- goodbye: when the user wants to end the conversation\n\n- thank_you: for expressions of gratitude\n\nI should also think about entities, which are specific pieces of information within the user's message that are relevant to the intent. For sports, entities could include:\n\n- sport_name: like soccer, basketball, etc.\n\n- team_name: names of specific teams\n\n- player_name: names of players\n\n- date: for scheduling or past games\n\n- time: similar to date, for timing of games\n\nWith intents and entities defined, I need to create training data for Rasa to learn from. This involves creating example user messages for each intent and annotating them with entities.\n\nFor example, for the `ask_score` intent:\n\n- \"What was the score of the Lakers vs Warriors game last night?\"\n\n- \"Did the Yankees win today?\"\n\n- \"Who won the football game between Manchester United and Liverpool?\"\n\nIn these examples, \"Lakers\", \"Warriors\", \"Yankees\", \"Manchester United\", and \"Liverpool\" would be entities of type `team_name`, and \"last night\" and \"today\" could be `date` entities.\n\nI also need to create response templates for each intent in the domain file. The domain file defines the overall structure of the chatbot, including intents, entities, responses, and actions.\n\nFor example, for the `ask_score` intent, the response could be something like:\n\n\"Sorry, I don't have real-time score data. You can check the latest scores on [sport website].\"\n\nOr, if I integrate with an API that provides sports data, I could fetch and display actual scores.\n\nBut for the sake of this example, I'll assume I'm using static responses.\n\nSo, in the domain file, I'd have something like:\n\nintents:\n\n- ask_score\n\n- ask_player_stats\n\n- ask_team_info\n\n- ask_scheduled_games\n\n- greet\n\n- goodbye\n\n- thank_you\n\nentities:\n\n- sport_name\n\n- team_name\n\n- player_name\n\n- date\n\n- time\n\nresponses:\n\n  utter_greet:\n\n  - text: \"Hello! How can I help you with sports today?\"\n\n  utter_goodbye:\n\n  - text: \"Goodbye! Have a great day!\"\n\n  utter_thank_you:\n\n  - text: \"You're welcome!\"\n\n  utter_ask_score:\n\n  - text: \"I can help you find scores for various sports games. Please specify which game you're interested in.\"\n\nAnd so on for each intent.\n\nI also need to create stories, which are examples of conversations that tie together intents, entities, and responses in a sequence. Stories help Rasa understand the flow of a conversation.\n\nFor example:\n\n## greet\n\n* greet\n\n  - utter_greet\n\n## ask_score\n\n* ask_score{\"team_name\": \"Lakers\", \"date\": \"yesterday\"}\n\n  - action_lookup_score\n\n## goodbye\n\n* goodbye\n\n  - utter_goodbye\n\nIn this story, the user greets the bot, asks for the score of the Lakers game from yesterday, and then says goodbye.\n\nI need to define actions in Python code that correspond to the actions mentioned in the stories. For example, `action_lookup_score` would be a custom action that retrieves the score based on the team and date provided.\n\nSince I don't have a real data source, I'll just simulate this action for now.\n\nI need to create a Python file, say `actions.py`, and define the action class:\n\nfrom typing import Any, Text, Dict, List\n\nfrom rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker\n\nfrom rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher\n\nclass ActionLookupScore(Action):\n\ndef name(self) -> Text:\n\nreturn \"action_lookup_score\"\n\ndef run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,\n\ntracker: Tracker,\n\ndomain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:\n\nteam_name = tracker.get_slot(\"team_name\")\n\ndate = tracker.get_slot(\"date\")\n\n# Here, I would normally query a database or API to get the score.\n\n# For now, I'll just return a dummy response.\n\nresponse = f\"Sorry, I don't have the score for {team_name} on {date}.\"\n\ndispatcher.utter_message(text=response)\n\nreturn []\n\nI also need to make sure that this action is included in the domain file:\n\nactions:\n\n- action_lookup_score\n\nSimilarly, I need to define slots for the entities so that Rasa can keep track of them during the conversation.\n\nIn the domain file:\n\nslots:\n\n  sport_name:\n\n    type: text\n\n  team_name:\n\n    type: text\n\n  player_name:\n\n    type: text\n\n  date:\n\n    type: text\n\n  time:\n\n    type: text\n\nNow, I need to create NLU (Natural Language Understanding) training data. This is where I provide examples of user messages mapped to intents and entities.\n\nIn the `nlu.yml` file:\n\nnlu:\n\n- intent: ask_score\n\n  examples: |\n\n    - what was the score of [Lakers](team_name) vs [Warriors](team_name) game last night?\n\n    - did the [Yankees](team_name) win today?\n\n    - who won the football game between [Manchester United](team_name) and [Liverpool](team_name)?\n\n- intent: greet\n\n  examples: |\n\n    - hey\n\n    - hello\n\n    - hi there\n\n- intent: goodbye\n\n  examples: |\n\n    - bye\n\n    - goodbye\n\n    - see you later\n\n- intent: thank_you\n\n  examples: |\n\n    - thanks\n\n    - thank you\n\n    - appreciate it\n\nI should expand this with more examples for each intent to improve the model's accuracy.\n\nOnce I have the intents, entities, responses, stories, and NLU data set up, I can train the Rasa model using `rasa train`.\n\nAfter training, I can test the chatbot using the Rasa shell with `rasa shell`. This will allow me to interact with the bot in the command line and see if it's understanding the intents and providing the correct responses.\n\nIf everything works as expected, I can then think about deploying the chatbot to a web interface or integrating it with other platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, etc.\n\nFor deployment, Rasa provides various options. I can use Rasa X, which is a platform for building and managing conversational AI applications, or I can deploy the Rasa server as a REST API and build a custom frontend.\n\nIn summary, the steps to create a sports information chatbot using Rasa are:\n\n1. Install Rasa and set up a new project.\n\n2. Define intents relevant to the sports topic.\n\n3. Define entities that capture important information in user messages.\n\n4. Create NLU training data with examples for each intent and entity.\n\n5. Define responses for each intent in the domain file.\n\n6. Create conversation stories to illustrate the flow of interactions.\n\n7. Implement custom actions in Python if needed (e.g., to fetch data).\n\n8. Train the Rasa model.\n\n9. Test the chatbot using the Rasa shell.\n\n10. Deploy the chatbot to the desired platform.\n\nThis should give me a functional chatbot that can engage in basic conversations about sports and provide information based on the user's queries."

]n        original_blob_client.upload_blob(file.read())\n\n        # Resize image to thumbnail\n        img = Image.open(file)\n        img.thumbnail((150, 150))\n        thumbnail_io = io.BytesIO()\n        img.save(thumbnail_io, format='JPEG')\n        thumbnail_io.seek(0)\n\n        # Upload thumbnail\n        thumbnail_filename = f\"thumb_{file.filename}\"\n        thumbnail_blob_client = container_client.get_blob_client(thumbnail_filename)\n        thumbnail_blob_client.upload_blob(thumbnail_io.read(), content_settings={\"content_type\": \"image/jpeg\"})\n\n        return redirect(url_for('index'))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We open the uploaded image using Pillow.\n- We resize it to a thumbnail of 150x150 pixels.\n- We save the thumbnail to a BytesIO object.\n- We upload both the original image and the thumbnail to Azure Blob Storage.\n\nNow, in the `index` function, we need to list only the thumbnail blobs. To distinguish between original images and thumbnails, we're prefixing thumbnails with \"thumb_\". So, in the `index` function, we can filter the blobs to include only those that start with \"thumb_\":\n\n```python\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    # List blobs in the container that are thumbnails\n    blob_list = container_client.list_blobs(name_starts_with=\"thumb_\")\n    thumbnails = []\n    for blob in blob_list:\n        blob_url = blob_service_client.get_blob_client(container=AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER, blob=blob.name).url\n        thumbnails.append(blob_url)\n    return render_template('index.html', thumbnails=thumbnails)\n```\n\nAnd in `index.html`, we can display these thumbnails:\n\n```html\n{% for thumbnail in thumbnails %}\n    <img src=\"{{ thumbnail }}\" alt=\"{{ loop.index }}\" width=\"150\">\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nThis should give you a basic image upload and display functionality with thumbnails generated and stored in Azure Blob Storage.\n\nRemember to handle exceptions and errors in a real-world application, such as file type validation, upload size limits, and ensuring that the Azure Blob Storage credentials are securely managed.\n\nAlso, consider implementing user authentication if you want to restrict access to certain features or personalize the user experience.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with your Flask web application using Azure Blob Storage! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
