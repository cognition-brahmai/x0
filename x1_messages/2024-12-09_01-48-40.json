        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, the amusement park has a total budget of $12 million for their new roller coaster project. This budget covers three main areas: design, construction, and testing. Each of these areas has a specific percentage allocated to it, and the construction phase is further divided into three sub-phases: track installation, support structure, and theming.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much money is allocated to design and testing since they have specific percentages assigned to them. Then, I'll determine the budget for construction by subtracting the design and testing budgets from the total budget. After that, I'll break down the construction budget into its three sub-phases based on the given percentages.\n\nLet's start with the design costs. The problem states that design accounts for 15% of the total budget. So, to find the design budget, I'll calculate 15% of $12 million.\n\nDesign budget = 15% of $12,000,000\n               = 0.15 * $12,000,000\n               = $1,800,000\n\nNext, testing accounts for 10% of the total budget.\n\nTesting budget = 10% of $12,000,000\n                = 0.10 * $12,000,000\n                = $1,200,000\n\nNow, to find the construction budget, I'll subtract the design and testing budgets from the total budget.\n\nConstruction budget = Total budget - (Design budget + Testing budget)\n                    = $12,000,000 - ($1,800,000 + $1,200,000)\n                    = $12,000,000 - $3,000,000\n                    = $9,000,000\n\nSo, the construction phase has a budget of $9 million. This construction budget is divided into three phases: track installation (50%), support structure (25%), and theming (15%). That adds up to 90% of the construction budget. I wonder what the remaining 10% is for. Maybe it's reserved for contingencies or other construction-related expenses not specified here. But for now, I'll focus on the three phases mentioned.\n\nLet's calculate the budget for each construction phase.\n\n1. Track installation: 50% of the construction budget\n\nTrack installation budget = 50% of $9,000,000\n                           = 0.50 * $9,000,000\n                           = $4,500,000\n\n2. Support structure: 25% of the construction budget\n\nSupport structure budget = 25% of $9,000,000\n                          = 0.25 * $9,000,000\n                          = $2,250,000\n\n3. Theming: 15% of the construction budget\n\nTheming budget = 15% of $9,000,000\n                = 0.15 * $9,000,000\n                = $1,350,000\n\nJust to double-check, let's add up these three amounts and see if they total the construction budget.\n\nTotal construction budget allocated = $4,500,000 + $2,250,000 + $1,350,000\n                                     = $8,100,000\n\nWait a minute, that's only 90% of the $9 million construction budget. So, there's $900,000 unaccounted for ($9,000,000 - $8,100,000 = $900,000). Maybe this remaining amount is for other construction expenses or a contingency fund. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume that's the case.\n\nTo summarize, here's the budget allocation for each phase:\n\n- Design: $1,800,000 (15% of total budget)\n\n- Construction:\n\n- Track installation: $4,500,000 (50% of construction budget)\n\n- Support structure: $2,250,000 (25% of construction budget)\n\n- Theming: $1,350,000 (15% of construction budget)\n\n- Other construction expenses/contingency: $900,000 (10% of construction budget)\n\n- Testing: $1,200,000 (10% of total budget)\n\nAdding these up:\n\n$1,800,000 (design) + $9,000,000 (construction) + $1,200,000 (testing) = $12,000,000 (total budget)\n\nEverything checks out. I think this is the correct allocation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Design: } \\$1,800,000; \\text{ Construction: } \\$9,000,000 \\text{ (Track Installation: } \\$4,500,000; \\text{ Support Structure: } \\$2,250,000; \\text{ Theming: } \\$1,350,000); \\text{ Testing: } \\$1,200,000} \\]"
