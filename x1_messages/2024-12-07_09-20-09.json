        "content": "So there's this problem about 100 lockers in a hallway, and students are toggling their states in a specific pattern. Let's see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, there are 100 lockers, all closed initially. The first student opens every single locker. So, after the first student, all 100 lockers are open.\n\nThen, the second student comes along and closes every second locker, meaning lockers 2, 4, 6, up to 100. So, these lockers are now closed again, while the odd-numbered ones remain open.\n\nNext, the third student toggles every third locker. Toggling means if it's open, they close it, and if it's closed, they open it. So, lockers 3, 6, 9, etc., will have their states changed based on their current status.\n\nThis pattern continues with each subsequent student toggling every nth locker, where n is the student's number, up to the 100th student.\n\nThe question is, after all 100 students have passed, how many lockers are left open?\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky at first, but maybe there's a pattern or a mathematical principle that can help simplify it.\n\nLet me think about what happens to a particular locker. Say, locker number 12. Which students will toggle it?\n\nStudent 1 toggles it (opens it).\n\nStudent 2 toggles it (closes it, since it was opened by student 1).\n\nStudent 3 toggles it (opens it again, since student 2 closed it).\n\nStudent 4 passes by, but 12 is not a multiple of 4, so it's not toggled.\n\nStudent 6 toggles it (since 12 is a multiple of 6), so it changes state again.\n\nStudent 12 toggles it as well.\n\nSo, for locker 12, it was toggled by students 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12.\n\nWait a minute, these are all the divisors of 12. So, the number of times a locker is toggled is equal to the number of its divisors.\n\nNow, if a locker is toggled an even number of times, it will end up closed, because each toggle switches its state.\n\nIf it's toggled an odd number of times, it will end up open.\n\nTherefore, the lockers that are left open are those that have an odd number of toggles, meaning an odd number of divisors.\n\nBut which numbers have an odd number of divisors?\n\nLet's think about the divisors of a number. For example, take 6: its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6. That's even.\n\nTake 9: divisors are 1, 3, 9. That's odd.\n\nOh, perfect squares have an odd number of divisors because one of the divisors is repeated. For example, 9 is 3 squared, so its divisors are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nSimilarly, 16 is 4 squared, with divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16: that's five, which is odd.\n\nSo, perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nTherefore, the lockers that are left open are those with numbers that are perfect squares.\n\nNow, how many perfect squares are there between 1 and 100?\n\nWell, 1^2 = 1\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n6^2 = 36\n\n7^2 = 49\n\n8^2 = 64\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n10^2 = 100\n\nSo, there are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n\nTherefore, after all 100 students have passed, there should be 10 lockers left open.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this reasoning.\n\nIs it true that only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors?\n\nYes, because for non-square numbers, divisors come in pairs. For example, 6: 1 and 6, 2 and 3.\n\nBut for perfect squares, one of the divisors is repeated. For example, 9: 3 is repeated.\n\nSo, the number of divisors is odd only for perfect squares.\n\nHence, only lockers with numbers that are perfect squares will be left open.\n\nAnd between 1 and 100, there are 10 perfect squares.\n\nSo, the answer should be 10 lockers left open.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions or if this logic holds for all numbers.\n\nLet's take another example, say locker number 1.\n\nStudent 1 toggles it (opens it).\n\nNo other student toggles it because 1 is only divisible by 1.\n\nSo, it's toggled only once, which is odd, so it remains open.\n\nLocker number 2:\n\nToggled by student 1 (open), student 2 (close).\n\nTwo toggles, even, so closed.\n\nLocker number 3:\n\nToggled by student 1 (open), student 3 (close).\n\nTwo toggles, even, closed.\n\nLocker number 4:\n\nStudent 1 (open), student 2 (close), student 4 (open).\n\nThree toggles, odd, so open.\n\nLocker number 5:\n\nStudent 1 (open), student 5 (close).\n\nTwo toggles, even, closed.\n\nLocker number 6:\n\nStudent 1 (open), student 2 (close), student 3 (open), student 6 (close).\n\nFour toggles, even, closed.\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier conclusion that only perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100) are left open.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 10 lockers left open.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
