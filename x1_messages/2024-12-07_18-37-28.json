        "content": "So, I know that Earth takes 24 hours to complete one full rotation around its axis. That means it rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours. I need to find out how many degrees it rotates every 15 minutes.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the total rotation time into minutes because the interval I'm interested in is in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 24 hours, there are 24 times 60, which is 1440 minutes.\n\nSo, Earth rotates 360 degrees in 1440 minutes.\n\nNow, to find out how many degrees it rotates in 15 minutes, I can set up a proportion.\n\nDegrees rotated in 15 minutes = (15 minutes / 1440 minutes) * 360 degrees.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 15 divided by 1440.\n\n15 \u00f7 1440 = 0.01041666...\n\nThen, multiply that by 360.\n\n0.01041666... * 360 = 3.75 degrees.\n\nSo, Earth rotates 3.75 degrees every 15 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many 15-minute intervals there are in 1440 minutes.\n\n1440 \u00f7 15 = 96 intervals.\n\nSo, if Earth rotates 360 degrees in 96 intervals, then per interval, it should rotate 360 divided by 96.\n\n360 \u00f7 96 = 3.75 degrees.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find out how many degrees Earth rotates per minute, and then multiply by 15.\n\nEarth rotates 360 degrees in 1440 minutes, so per minute, it rotates 360 \u00f7 1440 = 0.25 degrees.\n\nThen, in 15 minutes, it would rotate 0.25 degrees per minute times 15 minutes, which is 3.75 degrees.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 3.75 degrees is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.75} \\]"
