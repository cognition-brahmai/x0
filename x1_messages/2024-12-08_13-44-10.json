        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a square garden with an area of 64 square meters, and I need to figure out how many meters I'd walk if I went all the way around the perimeter. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. So, if the area is 64 square meters, that means that one side of the square is 8 meters long, because 8 times 8 equals 64.\n\nNow, the perimeter of a square is the total length around the outside. Since a square has four equal sides, I can just multiply the length of one side by 4 to get the perimeter. So, if one side is 8 meters, the perimeter would be 8 meters times 4, which is 32 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to make sure I'm correct? Maybe I can visualize the garden. Imagine a garden that's perfectly square, and each side is 8 meters long. If I start at one corner and walk along one side, that's 8 meters. Then I turn 90 degrees and walk another 8 meters, and repeat that two more times. So, in total, I'd have walked 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 8, which is 32 meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the perimeter of a square, which is P = 4s, where s is the length of a side. Since s is 8 meters, P equals 4 times 8, which again is 32 meters.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there anything about the garden being square that I should consider? Well, squares have equal sides, and all angles are right angles, but I don't think that affects the perimeter calculation in this case.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the area is indeed 64 square meters. If I take the side length of 8 meters and square it, I get 64, which matches the given area. So, that checks out.\n\nIs there any possibility that the garden isn't a perfect square? The problem says it's a square garden, so I think it's safe to assume that all sides are equal.\n\nJust to cover all bases, maybe I should consider if the area could include paths or something outside the garden, but the problem seems straightforward. It's just about the perimeter of the garden itself.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you walk around the perimeter of the garden, you will have walked 32 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
