It's a measure of profitability expressed as a percentage of the selling price. It shows how much of each dollar of sales is translated into profit.\n\nTo find the profit margin percentage, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\\text{Profit Margin Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \\text{Cost Price per Unit}}{\\text{Selling Price per Unit}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- Cost Price per Unit = $20\n\n- Selling Price per Unit = $35\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\\text{Profit Margin Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{35 - 20}{35} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{15}{35} \\right) \\times 100\\%\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the fraction:\n\n\\[\\frac{15}{35} = \\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.4286\\]\n\nMultiplying by 100% to get the percentage:\n\n\\[0.4286 \\times 100\\% \\approx 42.86\\%\\]\n\nTherefore, the profit margin percentage on each unit sold is approximately 42.86%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42.86\\%} \\]"
