        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how much labor is required for each product per week, then combine that to find the total labor hours per week, and finally, calculate the monthly labor costs based on the workers' hourly wage.\n\nSo, the factory produces 500 units of product A each week, and each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor. So, for product A, the total labor hours per week would be 500 units times 2 hours per unit. That should be 1000 hours.\n\nNext, for product B, the factory produces 300 units per week, and each unit requires 3 hours of labor. So, for product B, the total labor hours per week would be 300 units times 3 hours per unit, which is 900 hours.\n\nNow, to find the total labor hours per week for both products, we add the labor hours for A and B together: 1000 hours plus 900 hours equals 1900 hours per week.\n\nNext, we need to find out the monthly labor costs. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, we can multiply the weekly labor hours by 4 to get the monthly labor hours. So, 1900 hours per week times 4 weeks equals 7600 hours per month.\n\nFinally, since workers are paid $15 per hour, we can find the total labor costs by multiplying the total monthly hours by the hourly wage. So, 7600 hours times $15 per hour would be $114,000 per month.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check those calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for product A: 500 units times 2 hours per unit is indeed 1000 hours.\n\nFor product B: 300 units times 3 hours per unit is 900 hours.\n\nTotal weekly labor hours: 1000 plus 900 is 1900 hours.\n\nMonthly labor hours: 1900 hours per week times 4 weeks is 7600 hours.\n\nLabor costs: 7600 hours times $15 per hour is $114,000.\n\nSeems correct. But I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect the labor costs, like overtime, holidays, or different working hours in a month. But based on the information provided, this should be the straightforward calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the month has more or less than 4 weeks. Typically, a month is about 4.33 weeks, but since the problem doesn't specify, using 4 weeks is acceptable. If precision is needed, we could adjust accordingly, but for now, $114,000 per month seems accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{114000} \\]"
