        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a street with houses on both sides. One side has 20 houses, and the other has 30. That means there are a total of 50 houses. Each house has at least one cat, and each cat can cover its own house plus the two neighboring houses. We need to figure out the minimum number of cats required to make sure that all 50 houses are covered.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the coverage of each cat. If a cat is in house X, it can cover house X, house X-1, and house X+1. So, essentially, each cat covers three houses: its own and its two immediate neighbors.\n\nNow, the houses are arranged in two rows, one with 20 houses and the other with 30. I need to consider whether the houses on one side affect the coverage on the other side. But the problem says \"its own house as well as the two neighboring houses,\" which probably means neighbors on the same side of the street.\n\nLet me first think about one side of the street. Suppose we have a row of houses, and we need to place cats such that each house is covered by at least one cat.\n\nFor a single row of n houses, where each cat covers three houses (its own and its two neighbors), the minimal number of cats needed can be determined by dividing the total number of houses by 3 and rounding up, because each cat covers three houses, but there might be some overlap.\n\nWait, actually, it's a bit more nuanced. If I place a cat in house 1, it covers houses 1, 2, and 3. Then, if I place a cat in house 4, it covers houses 4, 5, and 6, and so on. So, in this arrangement, each cat covers a block of three consecutive houses, and there's no overlap between cats.\n\nSo, for a row of n houses, the number of cats needed would be ceil(n / 3).\n\nLet me test this with a small number. If there are 3 houses, ceil(3/3) = 1 cat, which makes sense because one cat can cover all three houses.\n\nIf there are 4 houses, ceil(4/3) = 2 cats. So, cat 1 covers houses 1,2,3 and cat 2 covers house 4.\n\nSimilarly, for 5 houses, ceil(5/3) = 2 cats, but wait, two cats would cover up to 6 houses (1-3 and 4-6), but we only have 5, so that works.\n\nWait, but in the case of 5 houses, if I place cats in houses 1 and 4, that covers houses 1-3 and 4-5, which is all 5 houses.\n\nSimilarly, for 20 houses, ceil(20/3) = 7 cats.\n\nWait, 3*6 = 18, so 6 cats would cover 18 houses, and a 7th cat would cover the remaining 2 houses.\n\nWait, but 7*3 = 21, which is more than 20, but in practice, 7 cats can cover up to 21 houses.\n\nSimilarly, for 30 houses, ceil(30/3) = 10 cats.\n\nSo, total cats needed would be 7 + 10 = 17 cats.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to optimize this further by considering the arrangement of houses on both sides of the street.\n\nPerhaps houses on one side can share coverage with houses on the other side.\n\nWait, but the problem says each cat can catch mice in its own house and the two neighboring houses. It probably means neighbors on the same side of the street.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, I should assume that neighbors are only on the same side.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal number of cats would indeed be ceil(20/3) + ceil(30/3) = 7 + 10 = 17 cats.\n\nBut let me think if there's any way to reduce this number by strategically placing cats.\n\nFor example, if I place a cat in house 1 of one side, it covers houses 1, 2, and 3 of that side.\n\nSimilarly, if I place a cat in house 1 of the other side, it covers houses 1, 2, and 3 of that side.\n\nBut since the houses are on different sides, their coverages don't overlap.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that houses on one side might have neighbors on the other side.\n\nBut the problem likely intends that neighbors are only on the same side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the street forms a loop, but that's not specified.\n\nAssuming it's a straight street with houses on both sides, and neighbors are only on the same side.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of cats is indeed ceil(20/3) + ceil(30/3) = 7 + 10 = 17 cats.\n\nBut let me double-check with an example.\n\nSuppose one side has 20 houses: 1 to 20.\n\nPlace cats in houses 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19.\n\nEach cat covers three houses:\n\n- Cat 1: 1,2,3\n\n- Cat 2: 4,5,6\n\n- Cat 3: 7,8,9\n\n- Cat 4: 10,11,12\n\n- Cat 5: 13,14,15\n\n- Cat 6: 16,17,18\n\n- Cat 7: 19,20\n\nWait, cat 7 covers 19 and 20, which is only two houses, but that's still fine because it's covering its own house and one neighbor.\n\nSimilarly, for the other side with 30 houses: 1 to 30.\n\nPlace cats in houses 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28.\n\nEach cat covers three houses, except the last cat covers only houses 28,29,30.\n\nSo, that's 10 cats.\n\nTotal cats: 7 + 10 = 17.\n\nIs there a way to cover more houses with fewer cats?\n\nMaybe if some cats cover houses on both sides of the street, but the problem doesn't suggest that's possible.\n\nIt says each cat can catch mice in its own house and two neighboring houses, implying only on its own side.\n\nTherefore, 17 cats is the minimal number needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]"
