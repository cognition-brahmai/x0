        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to write a Python script that reads a CSV file and prints out the total number of rows, columns, and unique values in each column. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to read the CSV file. Python has a built-in module for handling CSV files called `csv`, but I've heard that pandas is more powerful for data manipulation. Since this task involves counting rows, columns, and unique values, pandas seems like a good choice because it can handle data frames efficiently.\n\nSo, I'll start by importing pandas. I think the code will look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n\nNext, I need to read the CSV file using pandas. The function for that is `pd.read_csv()`. I'll assume that the CSV file is in the same directory as the script, and I'll hardcode the file name for now. Later, I can make it more flexible by taking the file name as input.\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')\n```\n\nNow, to get the total number of rows, I can use the `shape` attribute of the data frame, which returns a tuple (rows, columns). So, `df.shape[0]` will give me the number of rows, and `df.shape[1]` will give me the number of columns.\n\nTo print the total number of rows and columns, I can do:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Total rows:\", df.shape[0])\nprint(\"Total columns:\", df.shape[1])\n```\n\nFor unique values in each column, I need to iterate through each column and use the `nunique()` function, which returns the number of unique elements in that column.\n\nI can loop through each column like this:\n\n```python\nfor column in df.columns:\n    print(f\"Unique values in {column}: {df[column].nunique()}\")\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the script would look like this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')\n\nprint(\"Total rows:\", df.shape[0])\nprint(\"Total columns:\", df.shape[1])\n\nfor column in df.columns:\n    print(f\"Unique values in {column}: {df[column].nunique()}\")\n```\n\nBut wait, this assumes that the CSV file has headers, which might not always be the case. I should consider that possibility. Maybe I should allow the user to specify whether the CSV has headers or not.\n\nI can add an argument to `read_csv()` called `header`, which by default is set to 0, meaning the first row is used as headers. If there are no headers, I can set it to None.\n\nPerhaps I can prompt the user to input whether the CSV has headers or not.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```python\nhas_headers = input(\"Does the CSV file have headers? (yes/no): \").lower()\n\nif has_headers == 'yes':\n    df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')\nelse:\n    df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv', header=None)\n```\n\nAlso, hardcoding the file name might not be ideal. It's better to ask the user for the file name.\n\nSo, I can use the `input()` function to get the file name from the user.\n\n```python\nfilename = input(\"Enter the CSV file name: \")\n```\n\nThen, read the CSV file using the provided file name.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfilename = input(\"Enter the CSV file name: \")\nhas_headers = input(\"Does the CSV file have headers? (yes/no): \").lower()\n\nif has_headers == 'yes':\n    df = pd.read_csv(filename)\nelse:\n    df = pd.read_csv(filename, header=None)\n\nprint(\"Total rows:\", df.shape[0])\nprint(\"Total columns:\", df.shape[1])\n\nfor column in df.columns:\n    print(f\"Unique values in {column}: {df[column].nunique()}\")\n```\n\nThis should cover the basic requirements. However, I should also consider error handling, in case the file doesn't exist or there are issues reading it.\n\nI can use a try-except block to handle potential errors.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntry:\n    filename = input(\"Enter the CSV file name: \")\n    has_headers = input(\"Does the CSV file have headers? (yes/no): \").lower()\n\n    if has_headers == 'yes':\n        df = pd.read_csv(filename)\n    else:\n        df = pd.read_csv(filename, header=None)\n\n    print(\"Total rows:\", df.shape[0])\n    print(\"Total columns:\", df.shape[1])\n\n    for column in df.columns:\n        print(f\"Unique values in {column}: {df[column].nunique()}\")\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"Error: The file was not found. Please check the file name and try again.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n```\n\nThis way, if there's a problem reading the file, the script won't crash and will inform the user about the issue.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if there are no headers and I set `header=None`, pandas will create default column names like 0, 1, 2, etc. That should be fine for counting unique values.\n\nAlso, I should think about whether there are any specific data types that might cause issues, but since `nunique()` works with different data types, I don't think that'll be a problem.\n\nLet me test this script with a sample CSV file to make sure it works.\n\nSuppose I have a CSV file called \"sample.csv\" with the following content:\n\n```\nid,name,age\n1,Alice,30\n2,Bob,25\n3,Alice,22\n```\n\nRunning the script and answering \"yes\" to headers should give:\n\n```\nTotal rows: 3\nTotal columns: 3\nUnique values in id: 3\nUnique values in name: 2\nUnique values in age: 3\n```\n\nIf I use a CSV without headers:\n\n```\n1,Alice,30\n2,Bob,25\n3,Alice,22\n```\n\nAnd answer \"no\" to headers, it should assign default column names and count unique values accordingly.\n\nSeems good. I think this script should accomplish the task.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python script that reads a CSV file and provides insights about its structure and content, specifically the total number of rows, columns, and the number of unique values in each column.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading Input:** The script will prompt the user for the CSV file name and whether the file contains headers.\n2. **Reading the CSV File:** Using pandas, the script will read the CSV file with or without headers based on user input.\n3. **Calculating Rows and Columns:** It will use the `shape` attribute to determine the number of rows and columns.\n4. **Counting Unique Values:** For each column, it will use the `nunique()` function to count unique values.\n5. **Error Handling:** The script includes try-except blocks to handle file not found errors and other potential exceptions.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntry:\n    # Get file name and header information from user\n    filename = input(\"Enter the CSV file name: \")\n    has_headers = input(\"Does the CSV file have headers? (yes/no): \").lower()\n\n    # Read the CSV file based on header information\n    if has_headers == 'yes':\n        df = pd.read_csv(filename)\n    else:\n        df = pd.read_csv(filename, header=None)\n\n    # Print total number of rows and columns\n    print(\"Total rows:\", df.shape[0])\n    print(\"Total columns:\", df.shape[1])\n\n    # Print unique values in each column\n    for column in df.columns:\n        print(f\"Unique values in {column}: {df[column].nunique()}\")\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"Error: The file was not found. Please check the file name and try again.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling:** The script starts by asking for the CSV file name and whether it contains headers.\n2. **Reading the CSV:** Depending on the user's response, it reads the CSV file with appropriate parameters.\n3. **Output Results:** It prints the total rows and columns using the `shape` attribute.\n4. **Unique Values:** It iterates through each column and prints the number of unique values using `nunique()`.\n5. **Error Management:** It handles exceptions to manage errors like missing files or other issues during file reading.\n\nThis script is interactive and handles basic error cases, making it robust for general use."
