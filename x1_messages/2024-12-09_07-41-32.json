        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. In a family of four children, what's the probability that there are exactly two boys and two girls, given that at least one child is a boy? Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sample space here. We have four children, and each child can be either a boy or a girl. So, without any conditions, the total number of possible combinations would be 2^4, which is 16. That makes sense because each child has two possibilities, and there are four children.\n\nNow, we're given that at least one child is a boy. So, we need to exclude the scenario where all four children are girls. There's only one way for that to happen: all four are girls. So, the total number of possible outcomes now is 16 minus 1, which is 15.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is having exactly two boys and two girls. So, how many ways can we have exactly two boys and two girls among four children?\n\nThis sounds like a combination problem. We need to choose 2 boys out of 4 children, and the remaining 2 will be girls. The number of ways to choose 2 boys out of 4 is given by the combination formula C(4,2), which is 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 favorable outcomes where there are exactly two boys and two girls.\n\nNow, to find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 6 divided by 15, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach it.\n\nLet me consider the sample space again. We have 15 possible outcomes since we're excluding the all-girls scenario.\n\nNow, let's list out all possible combinations to verify.\n\nThe possible gender combinations for four children are:\n\n1. BBBB\n\n2. BBBG\n\n3. BBGB\n\n4. BGBB\n\n5. GBBB\n\n6. BBGG\n\n7. BGBG\n\n8. BGGB\n\n9. GBBG\n\n10. GBGB\n\n11. GGBB\n\n12. BGGG\n\n13. GBGG\n\n14. GGBG\n\n15. GGGB\n\nNow, among these 15, the combinations with exactly two boys and two girls are:\n\n6. BBGG\n\n7. BGBG\n\n8. BGGB\n\n9. GBBG\n\n10. GBGB\n\n11. GGBB\n\nThat's six combinations, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the probability should indeed be 6/15, which is 2/5.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this using probabilities instead of counting.\n\nThe probability of having a boy or a girl is assumed to be equal, so each child has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or a girl.\n\nThe probability of having exactly two boys and two girls without any conditions is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=2) = C(4,2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 6 * (1/16) = 6/16 = 3/8.\n\nBut we have the condition that at least one child is a boy. So, we need to use conditional probability.\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nHere, A is having exactly two boys and two girls, and B is having at least one boy.\n\nSince A already implies having at least one boy, P(A and B) is just P(A).\n\nSo, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B)\n\nWe already have P(A) = 3/8.\n\nNow, P(B) is the probability of having at least one boy, which is 1 minus the probability of having all girls.\n\nP(B) = 1 - (1/2)^4 = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16\n\nTherefore, P(A|B) = (3/8) / (15/16) = (3/8) * (16/15) = (3*16)/(8*15) = (48)/(120) = 2/5\n\nSo, again, we get 2/5.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sample space being 15 equally likely outcomes, and 6 favorable ones, giving 2/5. Now, using probabilities, I get the same answer. So, it seems consistent.\n\nBut, I recall that in probability problems involving children, sometimes the assumption is that each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, and the gender of each child is independent of the others.\n\nIn that case, the total number of possible outcomes is 16, as I first thought, but excluding the all-girls case, we have 15.\n\nAnd exactly two boys and two girls can occur in 6 ways, so 6/15 = 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, using binomial probabilities, we get the same answer.\n\nSo, I think 2/5 is the correct probability.\n\nBut, to make sure, maybe I can consider another approach.\n\nSuppose we list all possible gender sequences for four children, as I did earlier, and count the number of sequences with exactly two boys and two girls.\n\nAs I listed, there are 6 such sequences out of 15, giving 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to fix one child as a boy, since we know there is at least one boy.\n\nThen, we have three remaining children, and we need to have either one or two boys among them, to end up with exactly two boys in total.\n\nWait, no. If we fix one child as a boy, then we need exactly one more boy among the remaining three children.\n\nBecause total boys would be 2, so if one is already a boy, we need one more boy among the remaining three.\n\nThe number of ways to have exactly one boy among three children is C(3,1) = 3.\n\nAnd the total number of possible outcomes for the remaining three children is 2^3 = 8.\n\nBut, wait, this approach seems a bit different from the earlier ones.\n\nIn this case, fixing one child as a boy, the probability of having exactly one more boy among the remaining three is 3/8.\n\nSo, the probability would be 3/8.\n\nBut earlier, I got 2/5. Hmm, now I have a discrepancy.\n\nI need to resolve this.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something in this approach.\n\nIf I fix one child as a boy, then the remaining three children can have any combination of boys and girls, except for the combination where all three are girls, because we already have one boy.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The condition is that at least one child is a boy, which is already accounted for by fixing one child as a boy.\n\nSo, in this approach, the total number of possible outcomes for the remaining three children is 8, and the number of favorable outcomes is 3, as calculated.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3/8.\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier calculation of 2/5.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the issue is whether all outcomes are equally likely.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered the sample space of 15 outcomes, each equally likely.\n\nBut is that actually the case?\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nBecause the problem states that it's known that at least one child is a boy.\n\nBut how do we obtain this information?\n\nIf we are told that at least one child is a boy, but without specifying which one, then the 15 outcomes may not be equally likely.\n\nThis is getting tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider the problem differently.\n\nSuppose we list all possible combinations of four children's genders, excluding the all-girls combination.\n\nThen, each of the remaining 15 combinations is equally likely.\n\nThen, the number of favorable outcomes is 6, as listed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 6/15 = 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, using conditional probability, as I did earlier, also gives 2/5.\n\nBut the alternative approach of fixing one child as a boy gives a different answer.\n\nSo, perhaps that approach is flawed.\n\nLet me check that approach more carefully.\n\nIf I fix one child as a boy, say the first child is a boy, then the remaining three children can be any combination of boys and girls.\n\nIn this case, the number of possible outcomes is 8, and the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to have exactly one more boy among the remaining three children, which is C(3,1) = 3.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3/8.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the earlier result of 2/5.\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nI think the issue is that fixing one specific child as a boy doesn't account for the fact that any one of the four children could be the one who is known to be a boy.\n\nIn other words, by fixing one specific child as a boy, I'm not considering the different possibilities of which child is the one who is known to be a boy.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the information \"at least one child is a boy\" could refer to any one of the four children.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of conditional probability more carefully.\n\nLet me define the events:\n\nLet A be the event that there are exactly two boys and two girls.\n\nLet B be the event that at least one child is a boy.\n\nWe need to find P(A|B), which is the probability of A given B.\n\nBy the definition of conditional probability:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nNow, since A is a subset of B (because having exactly two boys and two girls implies having at least one boy), P(A and B) is simply P(A).\n\nTherefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B)\n\nNow, P(A) is the probability of having exactly two boys and two girls.\n\nAs calculated earlier, P(A) = C(4,2) * (1/2)^4 = 6/16 = 3/8\n\nP(B) is the probability of having at least one boy, which is 1 - P(all girls) = 1 - (1/2)^4 = 15/16\n\nTherefore, P(A|B) = (3/8) / (15/16) = (3/8) * (16/15) = 2/5\n\nSo, again, I get 2/5.\n\nBut earlier, when I fixed one specific child as a boy, I got 3/8.\n\nThis suggests that fixing one specific child as a boy is not the same as knowing that at least one child is a boy.\n\nBecause knowing that at least one child is a boy doesn't specify which child is the boy.\n\nSo, to account for that, perhaps I need to consider that any one of the four children could be the known boy.\n\nIn that case, maybe I need to consider four separate cases, each where one specific child is a boy, and then combine them appropriately.\n\nWait, that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nI think the first approach using conditional probability is correct, giving P(A|B) = 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, considering the sample space of 15 equally likely outcomes and 6 favorable ones also gives 2/5.\n\nTherefore, I should conclude that the probability is 2/5.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I can think about it in terms of combinations.\n\nTotal number of ways to have at least one boy: 15, as calculated earlier.\n\nNumber of ways to have exactly two boys and two girls: 6.\n\nTherefore, probability is 6/15 = 2/5.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
