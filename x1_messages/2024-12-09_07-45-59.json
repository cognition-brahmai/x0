        "content": "So the library has 5,000 books in total. Out of these, 60% are fiction books, and the remaining 40% are non-fiction books. I need to find out how many more fiction books there are compared to non-fiction books.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of fiction books. Since 60% of the books are fiction, I can find that by multiplying 5,000 by 60%.\n\nNumber of fiction books = 5000 * 60% = 5000 * 0.6 = 3000 books.\n\nNext, I'll find the number of non-fiction books. Since the rest are non-fiction, that would be 40% of the total books.\n\nNumber of non-fiction books = 5000 * 40% = 5000 * 0.4 = 2000 books.\n\nNow, to find out how many more fiction books there are than non-fiction books, I'll subtract the number of non-fiction books from the number of fiction books.\n\nMore fiction books = 3000 - 2000 = 1000 books.\n\nSo, the library has 1,000 more fiction books than non-fiction books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
