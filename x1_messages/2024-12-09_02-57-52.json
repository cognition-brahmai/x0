        "content": "So there are 8 people in a room, and every minute, the number of people doubles. I need to find out how many minutes it takes for there to be more than 500 people in the room. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means for the number of people to double every minute. That means each minute, the current number of people is multiplied by 2. So, starting with 8 people, after the first minute, there would be 8 * 2 = 16 people. After the second minute, 16 * 2 = 32 people, and so on.\n\nThis seems like an exponential growth problem, where the number of people at any minute can be represented by the formula:\n\nNumber of people = initial number * (growth rate)^(time)\n\nIn this case, the initial number is 8, the growth rate is 2 (since it doubles), and time is in minutes. So the formula becomes:\n\nNumber of people = 8 * 2^t\n\nI need to find the smallest t such that 8 * 2^t > 500.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of people minute by minute until I exceed 500.\n\nAt t = 0: 8 * 2^0 = 8 * 1 = 8\n\nAt t = 1: 8 * 2^1 = 8 * 2 = 16\n\nAt t = 2: 8 * 2^2 = 8 * 4 = 32\n\nAt t = 3: 8 * 2^3 = 8 * 8 = 64\n\nAt t = 4: 8 * 2^4 = 8 * 16 = 128\n\nAt t = 5: 8 * 2^5 = 8 * 32 = 256\n\nAt t = 6: 8 * 2^6 = 8 * 64 = 512\n\nOkay, so at t = 6 minutes, there are 512 people in the room, which is more than 500.\n\nBut let me check t = 5 again to confirm.\n\nAt t = 5: 256 people, which is less than 500.\n\nAt t = 6: 512 people, which is more than 500.\n\nSo, it takes 6 minutes for the number of people to exceed 500.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a more efficient way to calculate this without listing each minute separately. Since this is exponential growth, I can use logarithms to solve for t.\n\nStarting with the inequality:\n\n8 * 2^t > 500\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 8:\n\n2^t > 500 / 8\n\n2^t > 62.5\n\nNow, to solve for t, I can take the logarithm of both sides. Let's use base 2 since the growth rate is 2.\n\nlog2(2^t) > log2(62.5)\n\nt > log2(62.5)\n\nNow, I need to calculate log2(62.5). I don't have a calculator right now, but I know that:\n\n2^5 = 32\n\n2^6 = 64\n\nSo, log2(64) = 6\n\nBut 62.5 is less than 64, so log2(62.5) is slightly less than 6.\n\nHowever, since t must be an integer (because time is in whole minutes), and t must be greater than log2(62.5), which is less than 6, t needs to be 6 minutes.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier calculation. At t = 5, 8 * 32 = 256, which is less than 500. At t = 6, 8 * 64 = 512, which is more than 500.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that it takes 6 minutes for the number of people to exceed 500.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the change of base formula to calculate log2(62.5) more precisely. The change of base formula is:\n\nlog2(x) = ln(x) / ln(2) or log10(x) / log10(2)\n\nAssuming natural logarithm:\n\nlog2(62.5) = ln(62.5) / ln(2)\n\nI know that ln(64) is ln(2^6) = 6 * ln(2), and since 62.5 is close to 64, ln(62.5) should be close to 6 * ln(2).\n\nBut without exact values, it's hard to be precise without a calculator.\n\nHowever, since the problem deals with whole minutes and doubling each minute, the discrete approach is sufficient.\n\nSo, the answer is 6 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
