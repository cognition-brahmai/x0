        "content": "So I've got this limit to find: the limit as x approaches infinity of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x)/(2x^2 - x). Hmm, okay, let's see how to tackle this.\n\nFirst off, when you're dealing with limits as x approaches infinity, you're basically seeing what the function does when x gets really, really large. For rational functions like this one, where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials, there's a general rule I can follow.\n\nThe rule is that you look at the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator. The degree is just the highest power of x in the polynomial. So, in the numerator, x^2 + 3x, the highest power is x^2, so the degree is 2. In the denominator, 2x^2 - x, the highest power is also x^2, so degree 2.\n\nNow, according to the rules of limits for rational functions:\n\n- If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the limit as x approaches infinity is 0.\n\n- If the degrees are the same, the limit is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n- If the degree of the numerator is greater than the denominator, the limit is either positive or negative infinity, depending on the signs.\n\nIn this case, both degrees are 2, so the limit should be the ratio of the leading coefficients. The leading coefficient in the numerator is 1 (from x^2) and in the denominator is 2 (from 2x^2). So, the limit should be 1/2.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's verify this step by step.\n\nOne way to find this limit is to divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator, which is x^2.\n\nSo, f(x) = (x^2 + 3x)/(2x^2 - x) = (x^2/x^2 + 3x/x^2)/(2x^2/x^2 - x/x^2) = (1 + 3/x)/(2 - 1/x).\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, what happens to the terms with x in the denominator? Well, 3/x approaches 0, and -1/x also approaches 0.\n\nSo, the limit becomes (1 + 0)/(2 - 0) = 1/2.\n\nAlright, that makes sense. But maybe there's another way to look at it, just to confirm.\n\nAnother approach is to factor out the highest power of x in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nSo, f(x) = (x^2(1 + 3/x))/ (x^2(2 - 1/x)).\n\nThen, since x^2 is common in both numerator and denominator, they cancel out, leaving (1 + 3/x)/(2 - 1/x).\n\nAgain, as x approaches infinity, 3/x and -1/x approach 0, so the limit is 1/2.\n\nHmm, consistent with the first method. Good.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using L'H\u00f4pital's rule? But that's typically used for indeterminate forms like 0/0 or infinity/infinity.\n\nIn this case, as x approaches infinity, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity, so it is an infinity/infinity form. So, L'H\u00f4pital's rule applies.\n\nL'H\u00f4pital's rule says that if the limit of f(x)/g(x) is infinity/infinity or 0/0, then the limit of f(x)/g(x) is equal to the limit of f'(x)/g'(x), where f' and g' are the derivatives of f and g, respectively.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nThe derivative of the numerator, x^2 + 3x, is 2x + 3.\n\nThe derivative of the denominator, 2x^2 - x, is 4x - 1.\n\nSo, now the limit becomes (2x + 3)/(4x - 1).\n\nAgain, as x approaches infinity, this is still infinity/infinity, so maybe I need to apply L'H\u00f4pital's rule again.\n\nThe derivative of 2x + 3 is 2, and the derivative of 4x - 1 is 4.\n\nSo, now the limit is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Okay, so all methods are pointing to the limit being 1/2.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider what happens if x gets really large, say x = 1000.\n\nPlugging x = 1000 into the original function: (1000^2 + 3*1000)/(2*1000^2 - 1000) = (1,000,000 + 3,000)/(2,000,000 - 1,000) = 1,003,000 / 1,999,000 \u2248 1.003 / 1.999 \u2248 0.502.\n\nThat's very close to 0.5 or 1/2.\n\nIf I take an even larger x, say x = 1,000,000.\n\nThen, (1,000,000^2 + 3*1,000,000)/(2*1,000,000^2 - 1,000,000) = (1,000,000,000,000 + 3,000,000)/(2,000,000,000,000 - 1,000,000) = 1,000,003,000,000 / 1,999,999,000,000 \u2248 1.000003 / 1.999999 \u2248 0.5000005.\n\nEven closer to 0.5.\n\nSo, numerically, it's confirming the analytical result.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the limit as x approaches infinity of (x^2 + 3x)/(2x^2 - x) is indeed 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
