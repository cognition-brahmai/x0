        "content": "Let's see. So, the farmer has 50 hens, and each hen lays an egg every other day. We need to find out how many eggs the farmer will have after one year, assuming a year has 365 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how often each hen lays an egg. If each hen lays an egg every other day, that means every 2 days, each hen lays one egg.\n\nSo, for one hen, the number of eggs laid in 365 days would be 365 divided by 2. But division might give a decimal, so I should consider how many complete 2-day periods there are in 365 days.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n365 \u00f7 2 = 182.5\n\nSo, one hen lays 182.5 eggs in 365 days. But since a hen can't lay half an egg, I might need to consider whether to round up or down. Maybe it's better to think in terms of whole eggs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in 365 days, there are 182 full 2-day periods, and one extra day. So, for each full 2-day period, the hen lays one egg. So, for 182 periods, that's 182 eggs. Then, on the extra day, since it's every other day, and the hen lays an egg every second day, on day 365, which is an odd day, the hen would lay an egg.\n\nWait, let me think differently. If the hen lays an egg on day 1, then on day 3, day 5, and so on, up to day 365.\n\nSo, the number of eggs laid by one hen in 365 days would be the number of odd days in 365 days.\n\nSince 365 is odd, there are 183 odd days in 365 days.\n\nWait, is that right? Let's see: from day 1 to day 365, inclusive, the number of odd days would be (365 + 1) \u00f7 2 = 183.\n\nYes, so each hen lays 183 eggs in 365 days.\n\nNow, since there are 50 hens, the total number of eggs would be 50 times 183.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n50 \u00d7 183 = 50 \u00d7 180 + 50 \u00d7 3 = 9000 + 150 = 9150\n\nSo, the farmer will have 9,150 eggs after one year.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, since each hen lays an egg every other day, the number of eggs per hen per day is 1/2.\n\nSo, in 365 days, one hen lays 365 \u00d7 (1/2) = 182.5 eggs.\n\nBut since we can't have half an egg, maybe it's better to consider it as 182 eggs, but earlier I thought it's 183.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of days each hen lays an egg.\n\nIf a hen lays an egg every other day, starting from day 1, then on days 1,3,5,...,365, which are the odd days.\n\nSince 365 is odd, the number of odd days is (365 + 1) \u00f7 2 = 183.\n\nSo, each hen lays 183 eggs in 365 days.\n\nTherefore, 50 hens would lay 50 \u00d7 183 = 9,150 eggs.\n\nAlternatively, if the hens start laying on day 2, then it would be days 2,4,6,...,364, which is 182 days.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"every other day,\" without specifying which day they start on.\n\nSo, perhaps to be general, I should consider that regardless of the starting day, the number of eggs laid by each hen in 365 days would be floor(365/2) or ceil(365/2).\n\nSince 365 divided by 2 is 182.5, rounding up would be 183.\n\nTherefore, each hen lays 183 eggs in 365 days.\n\nHence, total eggs = 50 \u00d7 183 = 9,150.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more precise way to calculate this.\n\nLet me consider that in 365 days, each hen lays an egg every 2 days.\n\nSo, the number of eggs per hen is floor(365 / 2) = 182 eggs.\n\nBut wait, 365 divided by 2 is 182.5, and floor of that is 182.\n\nBut actually, since the hen lays an egg on day 1, then day 3, day 5, etc., up to day 365, that's 183 eggs.\n\nSo, perhaps floor isn't the right function to use here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence.\n\nWhere the first term is 1, the common difference is 2, and the last term is 365.\n\nThe number of terms is ((365 - 1) / 2) + 1 = (364 / 2) + 1 = 182 + 1 = 183.\n\nSo, each hen lays 183 eggs in 365 days.\n\nTherefore, total eggs = 50 \u00d7 183 = 9,150.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9150} \\]"
