        "content": "So let's break this down. The company currently produces 5000 units each month, and each unit costs $10 to make. That means their monthly production cost is 5000 units times $10 per unit, which is $50,000 per month.\n\nNow, if they can reduce their production costs by 15%, that means they're saving 15% of that $50,000 each month. To find out how much that is, I'll calculate 15% of $50,000.\n\nFirst, I convert the percentage to a decimal. 15% is the same as 0.15.\n\nThen, I multiply $50,000 by 0.15 to find the monthly savings:\n\n$50,000 * 0.15 = $7,500\n\nSo, they save $7,500 each month.\n\nBut the question is about annual savings. There are 12 months in a year, so to find the total annual savings, I need to multiply the monthly savings by 12:\n\n$7,500 * 12 = $90,000\n\nTherefore, if the company can reduce its production costs by 15%, it would save $90,000 annually.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to find the new cost per unit after the 15% reduction and then calculate the annual cost at both the old and new rates to find the difference.\n\nFirst, the original cost per unit is $10. A 15% reduction means the cost per unit decreases by $10 * 0.15 = $1.50. So the new cost per unit is $10 - $1.50 = $8.50.\n\nNow, the monthly production is 5000 units, so the new monthly cost would be 5000 * $8.50 = $42,500.\n\nThe original monthly cost was $50,000, so the monthly savings are $50,000 - $42,500 = $7,500, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, for the annual savings, again, $7,500 per month times 12 months is $90,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the annual cost before and after the reduction.\n\nOriginal annual cost: 5000 units/month * $10/unit * 12 months = $600,000.\n\nNew annual cost: 5000 units/month * $8.50/unit * 12 months = $510,000.\n\nThe difference is $600,000 - $510,000 = $90,000, which again confirms the annual savings.\n\nSo, no matter which way I look at it, the company would save $90,000 per year if it can reduce its production costs by 15%.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, is the production volume constant throughout the year? Are there any additional costs or variables that could impact the total savings?\n\nBased on the information provided, the production is stated to be 5000 units per month, and the cost reduction is a flat 15% across all units. There's no mention of variable production levels or other costs, so it's reasonable to assume that the savings would be consistent month over month.\n\nHowever, in reality, there might be other factors to consider, such as:\n\n1. **Variable production levels:** If the company produces more or less in different months, the savings would vary accordingly.\n\n2. **Fixed costs:** Some costs don't change with production levels, so reducing variable costs might not affect them.\n\n3. **One-time costs:** There might be initial costs associated with implementing the cost reduction measures.\n\n4. **Price changes:** If the cost per unit changes over time due to market fluctuations, that could affect the savings.\n\nBut since the question provides a straightforward scenario with constant production and a uniform cost reduction, we can stick with the $90,000 annual savings figure.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the company might have to invest in new equipment or processes to achieve this cost reduction, which could impact the overall savings, but again, the question doesn't provide that information.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given data, the company would save $90,000 annually by reducing its production costs by 15%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90000} \\]"
