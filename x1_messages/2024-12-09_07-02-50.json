        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in the room. Half of them have blue eyes, and the other half have green eyes. So, that means 50 people have blue eyes and 50 have green eyes.\n\nNow, 20% of the blue-eyed people wear glasses. So, 20% of 50 is how many blue-eyed people wear glasses. Let me calculate that: 20% of 50 is 0.2 times 50, which is 10 people.\n\nSimilarly, 30% of the green-eyed people wear glasses. So, 30% of 50 is how many green-eyed people wear glasses. That's 0.3 times 50, which is 15 people.\n\nSo, total number of people wearing glasses is 10 (blue-eyed) plus 15 (green-eyed), which is 25 people.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of the total people in the room who wear glasses, I need to find what percentage 25 is of 100.\n\nThat's straightforward: (25 / 100) * 100% = 25%.\n\nSo, 25% of the total people in the room wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\%} \\]"
