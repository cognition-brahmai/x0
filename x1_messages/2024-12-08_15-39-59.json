        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: if I toss a coin 5 times, what's the probability of getting at least 4 heads? And I need to show my calculations. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you toss a fair coin, there are two possible outcomes for each toss: heads or tails, each with a probability of 0.5. Since the tosses are independent, the probability of a specific sequence of heads and tails is the product of the probabilities of each individual toss.\n\nBut here, I'm not interested in a specific sequence; I want to know the probability of getting at least 4 heads in 5 tosses. \"At least 4 heads\" means either exactly 4 heads or exactly 5 heads.\n\nSo, maybe I can calculate the probability of getting exactly 4 heads and the probability of getting exactly 5 heads, and then add them together to get the total probability of at least 4 heads.\n\nLet's start by figuring out the probability of getting exactly 4 heads in 5 tosses.\n\nTo find the probability of exactly 4 heads, I need to consider how many ways I can arrange 4 heads and 1 tail in 5 tosses. This is a combination problem, where order doesn't matter.\n\nThe number of combinations of 5 tosses taken 4 at a time is denoted as \"5 choose 4,\" which is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{4} = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)(1)} = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 5 different ways to get exactly 4 heads in 5 tosses.\n\nEach of these combinations has a probability of:\n\n\\[\n(0.5)^4 \\times (0.5)^1 = (0.5)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total probability of getting exactly 4 heads is:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{5}{32}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of getting exactly 5 heads.\n\nThe number of ways to get exactly 5 heads in 5 tosses is \"5 choose 5,\" which is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{5} = \\frac{5!}{5!0!} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, there's only 1 way to get all 5 heads.\n\nThe probability of this happening is:\n\n\\[\n(0.5)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting at least 4 heads, I add the probabilities of getting exactly 4 heads and exactly 5 heads:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{6}{32} = \\frac{3}{16}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 4 heads in 5 coin tosses is \\frac{3}{16}.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use the complement rule. The complement of getting at least 4 heads is getting 3 or fewer heads. But calculating that might be more complicated in this case, since it would involve adding up the probabilities of getting 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads, which is more work than just calculating the probability of at least 4 heads directly.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula for getting exactly k successes in n trials is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- \\(p\\) is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\nIn this case, n = 5, p = 0.5, and I want P(X \u2265 4) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5).\n\nI already calculated P(X = 4) = \\(\\binom{5}{4} (0.5)^4 (0.5)^1 = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{5}{32}\\)\n\nAnd P(X = 5) = \\(\\binom{5}{5} (0.5)^5 (0.5)^0 = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{32}\\)\n\nAdding them up gives \\(\\frac{5}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{6}{32} = \\frac{3}{16}\\), which matches my previous result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\) is the correct probability of getting at least 4 heads in 5 coin tosses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{16}} \\]"
