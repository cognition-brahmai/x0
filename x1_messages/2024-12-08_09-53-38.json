        "content": "A regular polygon with 12 sides, also known as a dodecagon, has a specific number of diagonals that can be calculated using a formula. The general formula to find the number of diagonals in any polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{n(n - 3)}{2}\n\\]\n\nLet's apply this formula to a dodecagon where \\( n = 12 \\):\n\n1. Substitute \\( n = 12 \\) into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{12(12 - 3)}{2}\n\\]\n\n2. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\n\n3. Multiply 12 by 9:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 9 = 108\n\\]\n\n4. Divide the result by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{108}{2} = 54\n\\]\n\nTherefore, a regular dodecagon has 54 diagonals.\n\nTo understand why this formula works, consider that in any polygon with \\( n \\) sides, each vertex connects to \\( n - 3 \\) other vertices to form a diagonal (it doesn't connect to itself or to its two adjacent vertices). Since each diagonal is counted twice in this manner (once from each end), we divide by 2 to get the correct count.\n\nSo, for a dodecagon:\n\n- Each vertex connects to \\( 12 - 3 = 9 \\) other vertices with diagonals.\n\n- With 12 vertices, this initially suggests \\( 12 \\times 9 = 108 \\) connections.\n\n- But since each diagonal is counted twice, the actual number is \\( \\frac{108}{2} = 54 \\).\n\nThus, the dodecagon has 54 diagonals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
