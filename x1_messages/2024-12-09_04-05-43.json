        "content": "Let's see. So, in this classroom, there are 4 times as many girls as boys, and there are 25 students in total. I need to find out how many boys there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably define variables for the number of boys and girls. Let's say, let's denote the number of boys as b and the number of girls as g.\n\nAccording to the problem, there are 4 times as many girls as boys, so that means g = 4b.\n\nAlso, the total number of students is 25, so b + g = 25.\n\nNow, I can substitute the first equation into the second equation. So, b + 4b = 25.\n\nThat simplifies to 5b = 25.\n\nNow, to find b, I can divide both sides by 5. So, b = 25 / 5 = 5.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 boys in the class.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. If there are 5 boys, then girls are 4 times that, which is 20 girls. Total students are 5 + 20 = 25, which matches the total given.\n\nSo, yeah, the answer should be 5 boys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
