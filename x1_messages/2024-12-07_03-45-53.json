        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with balls of different colors: 4 red, 6 green, and 10 blue. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a green ball at random.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of balls in the box. That seems straightforward. I'll add up the red, green, and blue balls.\n\nTotal balls = red balls + green balls + blue balls\n             = 4 + 6 + 10\n             = 20 balls\n\nSo, there are 20 balls in total.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a green ball. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are picking a red ball or a green ball. So, I'll add the number of red balls and the number of green balls to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nFavorable outcomes = red balls + green balls\n                   = 4 + 6\n                   = 10\n\nTherefore, the probability (P) of picking either a red or a green ball is:\n\nP = favorable outcomes / total outcomes\n   = 10 / 20\n   = 1/2\n\nWait, that seems too simple. Maybe I should consider whether the events are mutually exclusive or not. Picking a red ball and picking a green ball are two separate events, and you can't pick both at the same time, so they are mutually exclusive.\n\nFor mutually exclusive events, the probability of one or the other occurring is just the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, P(red or green) = P(red) + P(green)\n\nLet's calculate P(red) and P(green) separately.\n\nP(red) = number of red balls / total balls\n        = 4 / 20\n        = 1/5\n\nP(green) = number of green balls / total balls\n          = 6 / 20\n          = 3/10\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\nP(red or green) = 1/5 + 3/10\n                = 2/10 + 3/10\n                = 5/10\n                = 1/2\n\nSo, I get the same answer as before. That gives me more confidence.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of complementary probabilities. The complement of picking a red or green ball is picking a blue ball.\n\nSo, P(red or green) = 1 - P(blue)\n\nP(blue) = number of blue balls / total balls\n         = 10 / 20\n         = 1/2\n\nTherefore, P(red or green) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this, I end up with 1/2. Maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Is there anything in the problem that suggests the balls are not equally likely to be picked? For example, are some balls heavier, smaller, larger, or somehow more difficult to pick than others? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume all balls are equally likely to be picked.\n\nAlso, it says \"randomly pick one ball.\" Random typically means each ball has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems valid.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use combinations. The number of ways to choose one red or green ball out of the total ways to choose any one ball.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red or green ball is C(4,1) + C(6,1) = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any one ball is C(20,1) = 20\n\nTherefore, P(red or green) = 10 / 20 = 1/2\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The probability is 1/2.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any chance of picking more than one ball or replacing balls, but the problem specifies \"one ball,\" so that's not applicable here.\n\nAlso, since it's a single pick, the order doesn't matter, and there are no sequential events to consider.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider. The answer should be 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
