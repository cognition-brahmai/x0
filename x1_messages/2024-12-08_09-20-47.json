        "content": "So, two cars start from the same point and drive in opposite directions. Car A is going at 40 miles per hour, and Car B is going at 60 miles per hour. We need to find out how far apart they will be after 2 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for them to travel in opposite directions. If they start from the same point and go in opposite directions, their distances from the starting point will add up to the total distance between them.\n\nSo, the total distance between them after a certain time should be the sum of the distances each car has traveled.\n\nLet me recall the formula for distance: distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nFor Car A:\n\nSpeed = 40 mph\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nDistance A = 40 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 80 miles\n\nFor Car B:\n\nSpeed = 60 mph\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nDistance B = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, since they are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them should be the sum of Distance A and Distance B.\n\nTotal distance = Distance A + Distance B = 80 miles + 120 miles = 200 miles\n\nWait, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider their relative speed. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nRelative speed = Speed of Car A + Speed of Car B = 40 mph + 60 mph = 100 mph\n\nThen, the distance between them after 2 hours would be:\n\nDistance = Relative speed \u00d7 time = 100 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 200 miles\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor to consider, like the direction or something else. Since they are moving in opposite directions from the same point, and we're only interested in the distance between them, I think distance addition is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if they were moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but in this case, it's opposite directions, so adding speeds makes sense.\n\nSo, after 2 hours, the cars will be 200 miles apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
