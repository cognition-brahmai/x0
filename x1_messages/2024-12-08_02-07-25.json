        "content": "So, five friends went to a restaurant and ordered four pizzas, and they divided them equally among themselves. The question is, how much pizza did each person get?\n\nAlright, let's think about this. There are four pizzas and five friends. They want to divide these pizzas equally among the five of them. So, essentially, each person should get the same amount of pizza.\n\nTo find out how much each person gets, we need to divide the total number of pizzas by the number of friends. So, that's 4 pizzas divided by 5 friends.\n\nMathematically, that's 4 \u00f7 5, which is the same as 4/5.\n\nSo, each person gets 4/5 of a pizza.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's see. If there are four pizzas and five people, and each takes 4/5 of a pizza, then 5 people taking 4/5 each would total 5 * 4/5 = 4 pizzas. That matches the total number of pizzas, so it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to imagine that all four pizzas are cut into fifths. So, each pizza is cut into 5 equal slices. Since there are 4 pizzas, that's 4 * 5 = 20 slices in total.\n\nNow, with five friends, if they divide these 20 slices equally, each friend would get 20 \u00f7 5 = 4 slices.\n\nAnd since each slice is 1/5 of a pizza, four slices would be 4 * 1/5 = 4/5 of a pizza.\n\nAgain, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nLet's consider another approach. Suppose each friend gets an equal share of each pizza. So, for each pizza, each friend gets 1/5 of it, since there are five friends.\n\nSince there are four pizzas, each friend gets 1/5 of each pizza, and there are four pizzas, so 4 * (1/5) = 4/5 of a pizza.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: each friend gets 4/5 of a pizza.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe in decimals. 4 divided by 5 is 0.8. So, each person gets 0.8 of a pizza.\n\nAgain, 5 people getting 0.8 each totals 5 * 0.8 = 4 pizzas, which matches the total.\n\nSo, whether we express it as a fraction, 4/5, or a decimal, 0.8, it's the same amount.\n\nPerhaps we can also think about it in terms of proportions. The total pizza is 4, and there are 5 friends. So, the proportion each friend gets is 4/5.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what we've already determined.\n\nI think it's clear that each person gets 4/5 of a pizza.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we might have missed. For example, is there any chance that some pizza might be left over, or maybe some pizza is not being divided equally?\n\nThe problem states that they divided the pizzas equally among themselves, so there shouldn't be any leftover pizza. Also, since they are dividing them equally, each person should get exactly the same amount.\n\nSo, no, there doesn't seem to be any other factor to consider.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that each person gets 4/5 of a pizza.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{5} \\text{ of a pizza}} \\]"
