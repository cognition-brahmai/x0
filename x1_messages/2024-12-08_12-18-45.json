Here's a general guide:\n\n1. **Goldfish**: Goldfish prefer cooler water temperatures, typically between 65\u00b0F to 72\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C). They can tolerate slightly lower temperatures but should not be kept in water that is too warm.\n\n2. **Angelfish**: Angelfish are tropical fish and prefer warmer water temperatures, usually between 78\u00b0F to 84\u00b0F (25\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C). They require stable water conditions to thrive.\n\n3. **Neon Tetra**: Neon tetras also prefer tropical water temperatures, typically between 70\u00b0F to 81\u00b0F (21\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C). They are sensitive to temperature changes and require stable conditions.\n\n4. **Betta**: Bettas are tropical fish and prefer warmer water temperatures, usually between 78\u00b0F to 82\u00b0F (25\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C). They originate from shallow, warm waters in Southeast Asia.\n\n5. **Guppy**: Guppies are adaptable and can tolerate a range of temperatures, but they generally prefer tropical water temperatures between 72\u00b0F to 82\u00b0F (22\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C).\n\n6. **Discus**: Discus fish require warmer water temperatures, typically between 82\u00b0F to 88\u00b0F (28\u00b0C to 31\u00b0C). They are sensitive to water quality and need stable, warm conditions to thrive.\n\nSo, based on their preferred water temperatures, you can categorize them as follows:\n\n- Cool water: Goldfish\n\n- Tropical (warmer water):\n\n  - Angelfish: 78\u00b0F-84\u00b0F\n\n  - Neon Tetra: 70\u00b0F-81\u00b0F\n\n  - Betta: 78\u00b0F-82\u00b0F\n\n  - Guppy: 72\u00b0F-82\u00b0F\n\n  - Discus: 82\u00b0F-88\u00b0F\n\nNote that within the tropical group, some fish prefer slightly warmer or cooler temperatures within the range, but all require warmer water compared to goldfish.\n\nIt's important to maintain the appropriate water temperature for each species to ensure their health and well-being in your aquarium. Additionally, housing fish with similar temperature preferences together is generally recommended to create a stable and suitable environment for all inhabitants."
