        "content": "So I need to prove that if a function f(x) is differentiable at x = c, then it must be continuous at x = c. Okay, let's start by recalling the definitions of differentiability and continuity.\n\nFirst, a function f(x) is said to be differentiable at x = c if the limit\n\nlim (h\u21920) [f(c + h) - f(c)] / h\n\nexists. This limit is the definition of the derivative of f at c, often denoted as f'(c).\n\nSecond, continuity at x = c means that\n\nlim (x\u2192c) f(x) = f(c).\n\nSo, to prove that differentiability implies continuity, I need to show that if the above limit for the derivative exists, then the limit of f(x) as x approaches c is equal to f(c).\n\nLet me think about this. If f is differentiable at c, then the difference quotient [f(c + h) - f(c)] / h approaches f'(c) as h approaches 0. Maybe I can manipulate this to show that f(c + h) approaches f(c) as h approaches 0, which would be equivalent to the continuity condition.\n\nLet me try rearranging the difference quotient:\n\n[f(c + h) - f(c)] / h = f'(c) (approximately, for small h),\n\nbut since the limit exists, I can write:\n\nf(c + h) - f(c) = h * f'(c) + error term,\n\nwhere the error term goes to 0 faster than h. But maybe that's getting too complicated. Let's try a different approach.\n\nWhat if I consider the limit of f(x) as x approaches c? Let me set x = c + h, so as x approaches c, h approaches 0. Then,\n\nlim (x\u2192c) f(x) = lim (h\u21920) f(c + h).\n\nI need to show that this limit equals f(c).\n\nFrom the definition of the derivative, I have:\n\nlim (h\u21920) [f(c + h) - f(c)] / h = f'(c).\n\nIf I multiply both sides by h, I get:\n\nlim (h\u21920) [f(c + h) - f(c)] = f'(c) * h.\n\nBut as h approaches 0, the right-hand side approaches 0 because f'(c) is finite (since the derivative exists) and h is going to 0.\n\nTherefore,\n\nlim (h\u21920) [f(c + h) - f(c)] = 0.\n\nThis implies that\n\nlim (h\u21920) f(c + h) = f(c).\n\nBut this is exactly the statement that lim (x\u2192c) f(x) = f(c), which is the definition of continuity at x = c.\n\nSo, if f is differentiable at x = c, then it must be continuous at x = c.\n\nWait a minute, is there any assumption I'm missing here? I think this proof seems straightforward, but maybe there's a gap somewhere.\n\nLet me check again. Starting from the differentiability:\n\nlim (h\u21920) [f(c + h) - f(c)] / h = f'(c).\n\nThen, multiplying both sides by h (which approaches 0, but is not zero), I get:\n\nlim (h\u21920) [f(c + h) - f(c)] = lim (h\u21920) [f'(c) * h].\n\nSince f'(c) is finite, the right-hand side is 0.\n\nTherefore, lim (h\u21920) [f(c + h) - f(c)] = 0, which implies lim (h\u21920) f(c + h) = f(c).\n\nYes, this seems correct. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\nMaybe to make it even clearer, I can use the epsilon-delta definition of limits.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nGiven that f is differentiable at c, meaning:\n\nfor every \u03b5 > 0, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that if |h| < \u03b4, then\n\n|[f(c + h) - f(c)] / h - f'(c)| < \u03b5.\n\nI need to show that for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that if |x - c| < \u03b4, then |f(x) - f(c)| < \u03b5.\n\nLet me set x = c + h, so |x - c| = |h|.\n\nThen, the differentiability condition becomes:\n\nfor every \u03b5 > 0, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that if |h| < \u03b4, then\n\n|[f(c + h) - f(c)] / h - f'(c)| < \u03b5.\n\nI need to show that for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that if |h| < \u03b4, then |f(c + h) - f(c)| < \u03b5.\n\nFrom the differentiability condition:\n\n|[f(c + h) - f(c)] / h - f'(c)| < \u03b5.\n\nMultiplying both sides by |h| (which is positive), I get:\n\n|f(c + h) - f(c) - h f'(c)| < \u03b5 |h|.\n\nNow, I can write:\n\n|f(c + h) - f(c)| = |f(c + h) - f(c) - h f'(c) + h f'(c)|\n\n\u2264 |f(c + h) - f(c) - h f'(c)| + |h f'(c)|\n\n< \u03b5 |h| + |h| |f'(c)|\n\n= |h| (\u03b5 + |f'(c)|).\n\nNow, since h approaches 0, I can make |h| as small as I want. To make |f(c + h) - f(c)| < \u03b5, I need to choose \u03b4 such that:\n\n|h| (\u03b5 + |f'(c)|) < \u03b5,\n\nwhich implies\n\n|h| < \u03b5 / (\u03b5 + |f'(c)|).\n\nSo, if I set \u03b4 = \u03b5 / (\u03b5 + |f'(c)|), then for |h| < \u03b4, the inequality holds.\n\nHowever, this assumes that f'(c) is finite, which it is since f is differentiable at c.\n\nTherefore, for every \u03b5 > 0, choosing \u03b4 = \u03b5 / (\u03b5 + |f'(c)|), if |h| < \u03b4, then |f(c + h) - f(c)| < \u03b5.\n\nThis satisfies the definition of continuity.\n\nSo, again, this confirms that differentiability implies continuity.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe by considering the linear approximation of the function.\n\nWe know that if f is differentiable at c, then near c, f can be approximated by its tangent line:\n\nf(c + h) \u2248 f(c) + h f'(c).\n\nIn fact, the error in this approximation goes to 0 faster than h does.\n\nSo, f(c + h) = f(c) + h f'(c) + error term, where error term / h \u2192 0 as h \u2192 0.\n\nThen, f(c + h) - f(c) = h f'(c) + error term.\n\nAs h \u2192 0, the right-hand side approaches 0 because h f'(c) \u2192 0 and error term \u2192 0.\n\nTherefore, lim (h\u21920) [f(c + h) - f(c)] = 0, which again implies lim (h\u21920) f(c + h) = f(c).\n\nThus, f is continuous at c.\n\nThis seems consistent with the previous arguments.\n\nI think this covers it. So, in summary, if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be continuous at that point.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{If a function } f(x) \\text{ is differentiable at } x = c, \\text{ then it must be continuous at } x = c.} \\]"
