        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 800 students. Out of these, 60% participate in sports activities. First, I need to find out how many students that is.\n\nTo find 60% of 800, I can multiply 800 by 0.60 (since 60% equals 0.60 in decimal form). Let me do that:\n\n800 \u00d7 0.60 = 480\n\nSo, 480 students participate in sports activities.\n\nNext, it says that 40% of those participating in sports also participate in music programs. I need to find out how many that is. Again, I'll convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.\n\n40% is 0.40 in decimal form. So, I'll multiply the number of students participating in sports by 0.40:\n\n480 \u00d7 0.40 = 192\n\nTherefore, 192 students participate in both sports and music.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I've understood the problem correctly. The question is asking for the number of students who participate in both sports and music. According to the information given, 60% of 800 students do sports, which is 480 students. Then, 40% of those 480 students also do music. So, 40% of 480 is indeed 192.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using fractions instead of decimals?\n\nOkay, 60% is the same as 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5. So, 3/5 of 800 students do sports:\n\n3/5 \u00d7 800 = (3 \u00d7 800) / 5 = 2400 / 5 = 480\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, 40% is the same as 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5. So, 2/5 of the 480 students do both sports and music:\n\n2/5 \u00d7 480 = (2 \u00d7 480) / 5 = 960 / 5 = 192\n\nAgain, I get 192 students.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as finding 60% of 800 and then 40% of that result, which is what I did. Or, I could think of it as finding 60% of 800 multiplied by 40% directly.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n60% of 800 is 480, and then 40% of 480 is 192.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it as:\n\nTotal students = 800\n\nPercentage participating in both = (60%)(40%) = 24%\n\nThen, 24% of 800 = 0.24 \u00d7 800 = 192\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, if I multiply the percentages directly, 60% times 40% is 24%, and 24% of 800 is indeed 192.\n\nBut is this method always correct? Let me think. If 60% do sports and 40% of those do music, it's equivalent to 60% times 40% of the total students, which is 24% of 800.\n\nYes, that makes sense. It's a shorter way to get to the answer. So, 24% of 800 is:\n\n0.24 \u00d7 800 = 192\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me consider if there's any overlap or additional conditions that I might be missing. The problem states that 60% participate in sports, and of those, 40% also participate in music. It doesn't mention any students participating in music only or any other activities, so I don't think there's any overlapping groups that I need to account for beyond what's already given.\n\nTherefore, the number of students participating in both sports and music is 192.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192} \\]"
