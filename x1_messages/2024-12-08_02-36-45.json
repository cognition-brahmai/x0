        "content": "So Mike reads 2 books every month, and I need to find out how many books he'll read in 5 years. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that there are 12 months in a year. So, if Mike reads 2 books each month, then in one year, he would read:\n\n2 books/month \u00d7 12 months/year = 24 books/year\n\nNow, to find out how many books he reads in 5 years, I can multiply the number of books he reads in one year by 5:\n\n24 books/year \u00d7 5 years = 120 books\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Let's see, another way to approach this could be to calculate the total number of months in 5 years and then multiply by the number of books he reads per month.\n\nSo, 5 years \u00d7 12 months/year = 60 months\n\nThen, 60 months \u00d7 2 books/month = 120 books\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it looks like Mike will read 120 books in 5 years.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there leap years in this period that might affect the number of days or months? Hmm, but since we're dealing with months and years in a general sense, and not exact dates, I think the standard 12 months per year is sufficient.\n\nAlso, the question assumes that Mike reads exactly 2 books every month, without any variation. In reality, people might read more or less depending on various factors, but since this is a math problem, I'll stick with the given rate.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Mike will read 120 books in 5 years if he maintains his pace of 2 books per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
