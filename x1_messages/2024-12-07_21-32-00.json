        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units per day, and each unit is sold for $15. So, the total revenue per day would be 500 units times $15 per unit. That should be 500 * 15 = $7,500.\n\nNow, the daily production cost is $3,000. To find the daily profit, I need to subtract the production cost from the total revenue. So, profit equals revenue minus cost. That would be $7,500 minus $3,000, which is $4,500.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other cost involved here? The question only mentions the production cost of $3,000 per day. Assuming that's the only cost, the daily profit should be $4,500.\n\nBut maybe there are other costs like overhead, labor, etc., that aren't mentioned. However, based on the information provided, I'll go with $4,500 as the daily profit.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations. 500 units at $15 each: 500 * 15 = $7,500. Production cost: $3,000. Profit: $7,500 - $3,000 = $4,500. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4500} \\]"
