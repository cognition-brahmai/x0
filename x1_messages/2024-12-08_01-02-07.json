        "content": "Let's see. So, we have two trains: one leaving Station A at 60 miles per hour and the other leaving Station B, which is 100 miles away from Station A, at 40 miles per hour. Both are traveling towards each other. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speeds add up. So, the speed at which they are approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nSo, the combined speed is 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph.\n\nNow, they start 100 miles apart. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 100 miles / 100 mph = 1 hour.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing?\n\nLet me think differently to confirm. Suppose I consider the position of both trains as functions of time.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the position of Train A as \\( p_A(t) \\) and Train B as \\( p_B(t) \\), where t is time in hours.\n\nAssuming Station A is at position 0, and Station B is at position 100 miles.\n\nTrain A is moving towards Station B at 60 mph, so its position over time is:\n\n\\( p_A(t) = 0 + 60t \\)\n\nTrain B is moving towards Station A at 40 mph, so its position over time is:\n\n\\( p_B(t) = 100 - 40t \\)\n\nThey meet when \\( p_A(t) = p_B(t) \\):\n\nSo,\n\n\\( 60t = 100 - 40t \\)\n\nAdding 40t to both sides:\n\n\\( 100t = 100 \\)\n\nDividing both sides by 100:\n\n\\( t = 1 \\) hour.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of relative velocity. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative velocity is the sum of their speeds, which is 100 mph, and the distance is 100 miles, so time is 1 hour.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the distance between them decreases at a rate of 100 miles per hour, so to cover 100 miles, it takes 1 hour.\n\nI think no matter how I approach it, the answer consistently comes out to be 1 hour.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that might affect this, like acceleration or changes in speed, but the problem states they are traveling at constant speeds of 60 mph and 40 mph.\n\nSo, assuming constant speeds and straight-line paths towards each other, the answer should be 1 hour.\n\nI can also visualize this: Train A covers 60 miles in an hour, Train B covers 40 miles in an hour. Together, they cover 100 miles in an hour, so they meet after 1 hour.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider their speeds in miles per minute, but that seems unnecessary since the units are consistent in the original formula.\n\nFor example, 60 mph is 1 mile per minute, and 40 mph is about 0.666 miles per minute. So, together, they cover 1.666 miles per minute. But then, 100 miles divided by 1.666 miles per minute is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. Same result.\n\nI could also use the concept of closing speed. The closing speed is the rate at which the distance between the two trains is decreasing, which is 100 mph. So, to close a gap of 100 miles, it takes 1 hour.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, and all methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]"
