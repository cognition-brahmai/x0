        "content": "So in this class, there are 30 students in total. Out of these, 18 passed the math exam and 12 failed. You want to find the ratio of students who passed to those who failed.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. It tells us how much of one thing there is compared to another.\n\nSo, in this case, we want to compare the number of students who passed to the number who failed. That would be passed divided by failed.\n\nPassed is 18 and failed is 12. So the ratio is 18 to 12.\n\nNow, ratios can be simplified, just like fractions. To simplify, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 18 and 12 is 6.\n\nSo, dividing both by 6:\n\n18 \u00f7 6 = 3\n\n12 \u00f7 6 = 2\n\nTherefore, the simplified ratio of students who passed to those who failed is 3 to 2.\n\nWe can write this as 3:2 or as a fraction 3/2, but remember, it's not a fraction representing a single number, but a comparison of two quantities.\n\nTo double-check, we can see if 3:2 makes sense with the original numbers. If for every 3 who passed, 2 failed, then the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nIf we divide the total number of students, 30, by 5, we get 6 students per part.\n\nSo, passed: 3 parts \u00d7 6 = 18\n\nFailed: 2 parts \u00d7 6 = 12\n\nWhich matches the original numbers. So, our ratio is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have directly divided passed by failed: 18 \u00f7 12 = 1.5. This means that for every student who failed, 1.5 students passed. But ratios are often expressed in whole numbers, so 3:2 is preferable.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the ratio in terms of passing and failing rates. But since the question asks for the ratio of passed to failed, 3:2 is the appropriate answer.\n\nSo, the ratio is 3:2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:2} \\]"
