        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that's traveling in two different phases with different speeds and also takes a break in between. We need to find out the total distance it covers.\n\nFirst, the train travels at a constant speed of 45 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance covered in this phase, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nDistance\u2081 = 45 mph \u00d7 4 hours = 180 miles\n\nAlright, so in the first 4 hours, the train covers 180 miles.\n\nNext, the train stops for 30 minutes. Now, stops don't contribute to the distance traveled, so we can ignore the time spent stopping when calculating distance. It only affects the total travel time if we were to calculate the average speed or something like that, but since we're only interested in the total distance, we can move on.\n\nAfter the stop, the train continues its journey at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for another 3 hours. Again, using the same formula:\n\nDistance\u2082 = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nSo, in the second phase, the train covers another 180 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance traveled, we just need to add up the distances from both phases:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 180 miles + 180 miles = 360 miles\n\nTherefore, the train travels a total of 360 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The first part is 45 mph for 4 hours, which is indeed 180 miles. Then, after a 30-minute stop, it travels at 60 mph for 3 hours, which is also 180 miles. Adding them up gives 360 miles. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer: 360 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
