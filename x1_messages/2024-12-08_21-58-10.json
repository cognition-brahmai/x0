        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a new sports complex with a budget of $10 million. There are three main facilities to build: a soccer field, basketball courts, and a swimming pool. Each has different construction costs per square foot and different maintenance costs. I need to figure out the maximum area that can be allocated to each facility within the budget, and also estimate the annual maintenance costs for each.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the costs involved. The construction cost per square foot is $150 for the soccer field, $200 for the basketball courts, and $250 for the swimming pool area. The maintenance cost is 5% of the construction cost annually for each facility.\n\nMy goal is to maximize the area for each facility without exceeding the total budget of $10 million.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( A_s \\) as the area of the soccer field in square feet.\n\n- \\( A_b \\) as the area of the basketball courts in square feet.\n\n- \\( A_p \\) as the area of the swimming pool in square feet.\n\nThe construction costs for each facility would be:\n\n- Soccer field: \\( 150 \\times A_s \\) dollars.\n\n- Basketball courts: \\( 200 \\times A_b \\) dollars.\n\n- Swimming pool: \\( 250 \\times A_p \\) dollars.\n\nThe total construction cost should not exceed $10 million:\n\n\\( 150A_s + 200A_b + 250A_p \\leq 10,000,000 \\)\n\nNow, to maximize the area for each facility, I need to consider the cost per square foot. The facility with the lowest cost per square foot should get as much area as possible within the budget, followed by the next cheapest, and so on.\n\nLooking at the costs:\n\n- Soccer field: $150 per sq ft\n\n- Basketball courts: $200 per sq ft\n\n- Swimming pool: $250 per sq ft\n\nSo, the soccer field is the cheapest per square foot, followed by basketball courts, and then the swimming pool.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the total area, I should allocate as much as possible to the soccer field first, then the basketball courts, and finally the swimming pool, within the budget.\n\nHowever, the problem might require having all three facilities, so I need to ensure that each gets some allocated area. But since it's about maximizing area within budget, I'll assume that we can allocate zero area to more expensive facilities if budget allows.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a distribution of the budget among the three facilities. If that's the case, I might need to assume equal allocation or some other criteria.\n\nWait, the problem says \"calculate the maximum area that can be allocated to each facility within the budget constraints.\" So, for each facility individually, meaning, what's the maximum area for the soccer field, then for basketball courts, then for the swimming pool, given the total budget.\n\nBut if I'm to calculate for each facility individually, considering the budget is shared among them, it gets a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the maximum possible area for one facility, assuming the other two get zero area.\n\nIf that's the case:\n\nFor the soccer field:\n\nTotal budget: $10,000,000\n\nCost per sq ft: $150\n\nMaximum area: \\( A_s = \\frac{10,000,000}{150} = 66,666.67 \\) sq ft\n\nFor basketball courts:\n\n\\( A_b = \\frac{10,000,000}{200} = 50,000 \\) sq ft\n\nFor swimming pool:\n\n\\( A_p = \\frac{10,000,000}{250} = 40,000 \\) sq ft\n\nSo, individually, those are the maximum areas.\n\nBut I feel like the problem might be expecting a combination where all three facilities are built, each with some area, not just one at a time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's to find the maximum area for one facility, given that the other two have some minimum required areas.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any minimum areas for the facilities. It just says \"multiple facilities: including a soccer field, basketball courts, and a swimming pool.\"\n\nSo, without loss of generality, perhaps it's to find the maximum area for each facility, assuming the others have zero area.\n\nIn that case, the above calculations hold.\n\nNow, for the annual maintenance costs, which are 5% of the construction cost annually for each facility.\n\nSo, for each facility, maintenance cost per year = 0.05 \u00d7 construction cost.\n\nFor the soccer field:\n\nIf \\( A_s = 66,666.67 \\) sq ft,\n\nConstruction cost: \\( 150 \\times 66,666.67 = 10,000,000 \\) dollars\n\nMaintenance: \\( 0.05 \\times 10,000,000 = 500,000 \\) dollars per year\n\nSimilarly, for basketball courts:\n\n\\( A_b = 50,000 \\) sq ft\n\nConstruction cost: \\( 200 \\times 50,000 = 10,000,000 \\) dollars\n\nMaintenance: \\( 0.05 \\times 10,000,000 = 500,000 \\) dollars per year\n\nFor swimming pool:\n\n\\( A_p = 40,000 \\) sq ft\n\nConstruction cost: \\( 250 \\times 40,000 = 10,000,000 \\) dollars\n\nMaintenance: \\( 0.05 \\times 10,000,000 = 500,000 \\) dollars per year\n\nWait a minute, in each case, the construction cost is exactly $10 million, which is the total budget. So, if we allocate the entire budget to one facility, we can get the maximum area for that facility, and the maintenance cost would be $500,000 per year for each.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a different approach, where all three facilities are built with some areas, not just one at a time.\n\nIf that's the case, I need to set up equations for the total construction cost and solve for the areas.\n\nLet's assume that all three facilities are to be built, and I need to find the areas such that the total construction cost is $10 million.\n\nSo, \\( 150A_s + 200A_b + 250A_p = 10,000,000 \\)\n\nBut with this equation alone, there are infinite solutions, as there are three variables and only one equation.\n\nI need more constraints to solve for the areas.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects to maximize the total area, given the budget, regardless of how the area is distributed among the facilities.\n\nIn that case, I would allocate as much as possible to the cheapest facility, which is the soccer field.\n\nSo, to maximize total area:\n\nAllocate as much as possible to the soccer field, then to basketball courts, and finally to the swimming pool, if budget remains.\n\nFirst, calculate the maximum possible area for the soccer field with the entire budget:\n\n\\( A_s = \\frac{10,000,000}{150} = 66,666.67 \\) sq ft\n\nBut if I allocate less to the soccer field, I can allocate to other facilities.\n\nTo maximize total area, I should allocate to the facilities in order of increasing cost per square foot.\n\nThat is, first soccer field, then basketball courts, then swimming pool.\n\nLet\u2019s consider allocating the entire budget to soccer field first, then see if allocating to other facilities increases the total area.\n\nTotal area if all to soccer field: 66,666.67 sq ft\n\nNow, if I allocate some budget to basketball courts, the cost per square foot is higher, so the area would be less for the same budget.\n\nSimilarly for the swimming pool.\n\nTherefore, to maximize total area, allocating the entire budget to the soccer field is optimal.\n\nBut perhaps the problem wants the maximum area for each facility individually, assuming the other facilities get minimal areas, but not necessarily zero.\n\nBut the problem says \"calculate the maximum area that can be allocated to each facility within the budget constraints.\"\n\nSo, perhaps for each facility, calculate the maximum area it can have, assuming the other facilities get zero area.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Soccer field: \\( A_s = \\frac{10,000,000}{150} = 66,666.67 \\) sq ft\n\n- Basketball courts: \\( A_b = \\frac{10,000,000}{200} = 50,000 \\) sq ft\n\n- Swimming pool: \\( A_p = \\frac{10,000,000}{250} = 40,000 \\) sq ft\n\nAnd the annual maintenance costs would be 5% of the construction cost for each.\n\nSo, for each facility:\n\n- Soccer field: \\( 0.05 \\times 150 \\times 66,666.67 = 500,000 \\) dollars per year\n\n- Basketball courts: \\( 0.05 \\times 200 \\times 50,000 = 500,000 \\) dollars per year\n\n- Swimming pool: \\( 0.05 \\times 250 \\times 40,000 = 500,000 \\) dollars per year\n\nInteresting, in each case, the annual maintenance cost is $500,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the areas in a way that the maintenance costs are proportional to the areas.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it seems like it's asking for the maximum area for each facility individually, assuming the others get zero area, and then to estimate the annual maintenance costs for each.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Maximum area for soccer field: 66,666.67 sq ft\n\n- Maximum area for basketball courts: 50,000 sq ft\n\n- Maximum area for swimming pool: 40,000 sq ft\n\nAnd annual maintenance costs:\n\n- Soccer field: $500,000\n\n- Basketball courts: $500,000\n\n- Swimming pool: $500,000\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a combination where all three facilities are built, I would need more information to determine the specific areas for each.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, I think the above approach is sufficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l|l|l}\n\\text{Facility} & \\text{Maximum Area (sq ft)} & \\text{Annual Maintenance Cost (\\$)} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Soccer Field} & 66,666.67 & 500,000 \\\\\n\\text{Basketball Courts} & 50,000 & 500,000 \\\\\n\\text{Swimming Pool} & 40,000 & 500,000 \\\\\n\\end{array} }"
