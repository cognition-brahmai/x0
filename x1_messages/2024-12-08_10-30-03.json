        "content": "So, the car has 4 tires, and each tire can last for 50,000 miles before they need to be replaced. The question is, how many miles can the car travel before all the tires need to be replaced?\n\nWell, since all 4 tires are being used simultaneously while driving, they all experience wear and tear at the same time. So, the car can travel up to 50,000 miles before all the tires need to be replaced together.\n\nBut, wait a minute, maybe there's a way to extend the total mileage by rotating the tires. You know, like rotating them periodically so that each tire gets even wear over its treads. But, if we're not considering rotation or any other maintenance, and assuming that all tires are used continuously until they reach their lifespan, then the car can go 50,000 miles before all tires need replacing.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose we have a scenario where we could replace tires individually as they wear out. But the question seems to be about replacing all tires together, so maybe that's not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a concept of tire mileage being additive in some way, but that doesn't make sense because all tires need to be in usable condition to keep the car running safely. So, the limiting factor is the tire that wears out first, which, in this case, would be after 50,000 miles, since all are wearing at the same rate.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the car can travel 50,000 miles before all tires need to be replaced.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50000} \\]"
