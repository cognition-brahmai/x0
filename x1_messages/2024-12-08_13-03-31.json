        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There are 12 students in a class, and the teacher picks 5 students at random to present their projects. We need to find the probability that both John and Jane are among those 5 students selected.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to approach probability problems. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 5 students out of 12, and the favorable outcomes are the ways to choose 5 students that include both John and Jane.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the total number of ways to choose 5 students out of 12. This is a combination problem because the order in which the students are chosen doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, for the total number of ways to choose 5 students out of 12:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12!}{5!(12 - 5)!} = \\frac{12!}{5! \\cdot 7!}\n\\]\n\nI can calculate this, but maybe I'll leave it for later to avoid big numbers too soon.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, which are the selections that include both John and Jane. If both John and Jane must be selected, then we're already choosing 2 specific students. So, we need to choose 3 more students from the remaining students to make a total of 5.\n\nSince there are 12 students in total and 2 are already chosen (John and Jane), there are \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) students left to choose from. So, we need to choose 3 students out of these 10.\n\nAgain, this is a combination problem:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10 - 3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3! \\cdot 7!}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability \\( P \\) that both John and Jane are selected is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{C(10, 3)}{C(12, 5)}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can compute these combinations.\n\nFirst, \\( C(12, 5) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12!}{5! \\cdot 7!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{5! \\times 7!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{5!}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{120}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 11 = 132 \\\\\n132 \\times 10 = 1320 \\\\\n1320 \\times 9 = 11880 \\\\\n11880 \\times 8 = 95040\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{95040}{120} = 792\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( C(10, 3) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3! \\cdot 7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{6 \\times 7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{6}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 9 = 90 \\\\\n90 \\times 8 = 720 \\\\\n720 divided by 6 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( C(10, 3) = 120 \\)\n\nTherefore, the probability \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{120}{792} = \\frac{5}{33}\n\\]\n\nWait, how did I get from 120/792 to 5/33? Let's check that division.\n\nFirst, simplify 120/792 by dividing numerator and denominator by 24:\n\n\\[\n120 \u00f7 24 = 5 \\\\\n792 \u00f7 24 = 33\n\\]\n\nSo yes, \\( \\frac{120}{792} = \\frac{5}{33} \\)\n\nTherefore, the probability that both John and Jane are selected is \\( \\frac{5}{33} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this in another way to verify. The probability that John is selected is the number of ways to choose 4 other students out of 11 (since John is already chosen), divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 out of 12.\n\nWait, maybe I should think step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability that John is selected. There are 12 students, and 5 are chosen. So, the probability that John is selected is \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\), since 5 out of 12 students are chosen.\n\nGiven that John is selected, now we have 11 students left, and 4 spots remaining. The probability that Jane is selected given that John is already selected is \\( \\frac{4}{11} \\).\n\nSo, the combined probability that both John and Jane are selected is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{12} \\times \\frac{4}{11} = \\frac{20}{132} = \\frac{5}{33}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the previous result, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of permutations if I prefer, but since the order doesn't matter, combinations are the way to go.\n\nSo, to sum up, the probability that both John and Jane are selected is \\( \\frac{5}{33} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]"
