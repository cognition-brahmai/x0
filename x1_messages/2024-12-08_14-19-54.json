        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 houses on one side of the street and 30 houses on the other side, making a total of 20 plus 30, which is 50 houses. Each house has 4 windows in the front, so the total number of windows would be 50 houses times 4 windows per house, which equals 200 windows.\n\nNow, half of the houses have their curtains closed on all windows. Half of 50 houses is 25 houses. So, 25 houses have all their curtains closed, meaning all 4 windows in each of these houses have closed curtains. Therefore, the number of windows with closed curtains is 25 houses times 4 windows per house, which is 100 windows.\n\nSince there are 200 windows in total and 100 of them have closed curtains, the remaining windows should have open curtains. So, 200 minus 100 equals 100 windows with open curtains.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor to consider here? The problem says that half of the houses have their curtains closed on all windows, implying that the other half have their curtains open on all windows. So, if 25 houses have all curtains closed, the remaining 25 houses have all curtains open.\n\nTherefore, the number of windows with open curtains would be 25 houses times 4 windows per house, which is also 100 windows.\n\nSo, the answer should be 100 windows have open curtains.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
