        "content": "To evaluate the definite integral of h(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 4x + 1 from x = 0 to x = 5, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the antiderivative of h(x):**\n   The antiderivative of a function is found by integrating each term separately.\n\n   - The antiderivative of 3x\u00b2 is (3/3)x\u00b3 = x\u00b3.\n   - The antiderivative of -4x is (-4/2)x\u00b2 = -2x\u00b2.\n   - The antiderivative of 1 is x.\n\n   So, the antiderivative H(x) is:\n\n   H(x) = x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 + x + C\n\n   where C is the constant of integration. Since we're dealing with a definite integral, we'll eventually eliminate C.\n\n2. **Evaluate H(x) at the upper limit (x = 5):**\n\n   H(5) = (5)^3 - 2*(5)^2 + 5 + C\n\n       = 125 - 50 + 5 + C\n\n       = 80 + C\n\n3. **Evaluate H(x) at the lower limit (x = 0):**\n\n   H(0) = (0)^3 - 2*(0)^2 + 0 + C\n\n       = 0 - 0 + 0 + C\n\n       = C\n\n4. **Subtract H(lower limit) from H(upper limit):**\n\n   Integral from 0 to 5 of h(x) dx = H(5) - H(0)\n\n                                 = (80 + C) - C\n\n                                 = 80\n\nSo, the definite integral of h(x) from x = 0 to x = 5 is 80.\n\n**Alternative method using the power rule for integration:**\n\nWe can also integrate h(x) term by term using the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), where n \u2260 -1.\n\nApplying this rule:\n\n\u222b(3x\u00b2) dx = 3*(x^(3))/3 = x\u00b3\n\n\u222b(-4x) dx = -4*(x\u00b2)/2 = -2x\u00b2\n\n\u222b(1) dx = x\n\nSo, the integral is x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 + x + C\n\nEvaluating from 0 to 5:\n\n(5\u00b3 - 2*5\u00b2 + 5) - (0\u00b3 - 2*0\u00b2 + 0) = (125 - 50 + 5) - 0 = 80\n\nThus, the integral evaluates to 80.\n\n**Graphical Interpretation:**\n\nThe definite integral from 0 to 5 of h(x) represents the signed area under the curve of h(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 4x + 1 between x = 0 and x = 5. Since h(x) is a quadratic function, its graph is a parabola opening upwards. The area calculated is the net area, where areas above the x-axis are positive and areas below the x-axis are negative. However, in this case, since the quadratic term is positive and the linear term is negative, we need to check if the function crosses the x-axis within [0,5].\n\nTo check for roots in [0,5], set h(x) = 0:\n\n3x\u00b2 - 4x + 1 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 - 12)] / 6\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(4)] / 6\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 2]/6\n\nx = 1 or x = 1/3\n\nSo, the function crosses the x-axis at x = 1/3 and x = 1. Therefore, between x = 0 and x = 1, the function is positive from x = 0 to x = 1/3, negative from x = 1/3 to x = 1, and then positive again from x = 1 to x = 5. The integral calculates the net area, taking into account these sign changes.\n\nHowever, since the parabola opens upwards and the intervals where it is negative are small, the overall area from x = 0 to x = 5 is positive, as indicated by the integral's value of 80.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe definite integral of h(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 4x + 1 from x = 0 to x = 5 is 80, obtained by finding the antiderivative, evaluating it at the bounds, and subtracting. This represents the net signed area under the curve of h(x) between these limits."
