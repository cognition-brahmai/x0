        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to write a C# console application that does what you've described. So, the program needs to keep asking the user for integers between 1 and 100, and it should keep doing that until the user enters -1. Then, it should calculate the sum, product, and average of all the numbers entered before -1, and display those results. Also, I need to make sure that the input is validated, so that if the user enters something that's not an integer or a number outside the specified range, the program handles it properly without crashing.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a new C# console project. I can do this using Visual Studio or even from the command line using dotnet new console. Once the project is set up, I'll need to write the code that handles the user input and the calculations.\n\nI should start by creating a loop that keeps running until the user enters -1. In each iteration of the loop, I'll prompt the user to enter a number, read their input, validate it, and if it's within the correct range, add it to a list or some kind of collection. Once -1 is entered, I'll use the numbers in the collection to calculate the sum, product, and average.\n\nLet me think about how to handle the input validation. I need to make sure that the input is indeed an integer and that it's between 1 and 100, except for -1 which is the exit condition. If the user enters something that's not an integer, or an integer outside the 1-100 range (except -1), I should inform them of the error and ask for input again.\n\nMaybe I can use a while loop that runs indefinitely, and inside it, use Console.ReadLine to get the user's input as a string. Then, try to parse that string into an integer. If parsing fails, I can display an error message and prompt again. If parsing succeeds, I'll check if the number is -1. If it is, I'll break out of the loop. If it's between 1 and 100, I'll add it to my list. If it's outside the range and not -1, I'll display an error message and ask again.\n\nFor calculating the sum, I can just iterate through the list and add up the numbers. For the product, I'll multiply them together, but I need to be careful because if there are many numbers, the product could get very large very quickly, maybe even causing an integer overflow. Maybe I should use a long instead of an int for the product. Or better yet, use decimal to handle larger numbers.\n\nWait, but in C#, int is 32-bit, which can hold values up to about 2 billion. If the user enters a bunch of large numbers, their product could easily exceed that. So, using long, which is 64-bit and can hold up to 9 quintillion, might be better, but still, if the user enters, say, 10 numbers all around 100, their product would be 100^10, which is 10^20, which is way bigger than long can handle. So, maybe I should avoid calculating the product if the risk of overflow is too high.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the product only if the numbers are small enough that their product won't exceed the maximum value of long. But that seems complicated. Maybe for the sake of simplicity, I'll just use long for the product and accept that if the numbers are too large, it will overflow.\n\nThe average can be calculated by dividing the sum by the number of entries. I should make sure to handle the case where no numbers are entered (except -1), to avoid division by zero.\n\nAlso, I should consider the data types. Sum can be an int, since the maximum sum would be 100 numbers each being 100, which is 10,000, well within the int range. Average should be a float or decimal, to handle fractional parts.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the numbers.\n\n2. Start a loop that runs indefinitely.\n\n3. Inside the loop:\n\na. Prompt the user to enter an integer between 1 and 100, or -1 to finish.\n\nb. Read the input as a string.\n\nc. Try to parse the string into an integer.\n\ni. If parsing fails, display an error message and prompt again.\n\nii. If parsing succeeds, check the value:\n\n* If it's -1, break out of the loop.\n\n* If it's between 1 and 100, add it to the list.\n\n* If it's outside the range and not -1, display an error message and prompt again.\n\n4. After the loop exits, check if the list is empty.\n\na. If it is, inform the user that no numbers were entered and exit.\n\nb. If it's not, calculate the sum, product, and average.\n\n5. Display the results.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in C# code.\n\nI'll need to use the Console class to read input and write output. I'll also need to use loops, conditionals, and exception handling for input validation.\n\nFor the list to store the numbers, I can use a List<int> from the System.Collections.Generic namespace.\n\nFor calculating the product, I'll initialize a variable to 1 (since multiplying by 0 would always give 0), and then multiply it by each number in the list.\n\nFor the average, I'll sum up all the numbers and divide by the count of numbers, casting appropriately to get a decimal result.\n\nI should also format the average to a certain number of decimal places for better readability.\n\nLet me consider writing a method to handle reading and validating the user input, to keep the code clean and avoid repetition.\n\nSo, I can create a method, say, ReadAndValidateInput, which will handle reading the input and validating it's an integer between 1 and 100 or -1. It will return the parsed integer.\n\nIn the main method, I'll call this method in a loop, and based on its return value, either add to the list or exit the loop.\n\nI need to make sure that if the user enters something that's not an integer, the program doesn't crash, but instead informs the user and asks again.\n\nI can use int.TryParse method for this, which attempts to parse the string to an integer and returns a boolean indicating success or failure.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the code structure:\n\nusing System;\n\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nclass Program\n\n{\n\nstatic void Main()\n\n{\n\nList<int> numbers = new List<int>();\n\nwhile (true)\n\n{\n\nint number = ReadAndValidateInput();\n\nif (number == -1)\n\n{\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\nelse if (number >= 1 && number <= 100)\n\n{\n\nnumbers.Add(number);\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter an integer between 1 and 100 or -1 to finish.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif (numbers.Count == 0)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"No numbers were entered.\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nint sum = CalculateSum(numbers);\n\nlong product = CalculateProduct(numbers);\n\ndouble average = CalculateAverage(numbers);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Sum: \" + sum);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Product: \" + product);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Average: \" + average.ToString(\"F2\"));\n\n}\n\n}\n\nstatic int ReadAndValidateInput()\n\n{\n\nwhile (true)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Enter an integer between 1 and 100, or -1 to finish: \");\n\nstring input = Console.ReadLine();\n\nif (int.TryParse(input, out int number))\n\n{\n\nreturn number;\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nstatic int CalculateSum(List<int> numbers)\n\n{\n\nint sum = 0;\n\nforeach (int number in numbers)\n\n{\n\nsum += number;\n\n}\n\nreturn sum;\n\n}\n\nstatic long CalculateProduct(List<int> numbers)\n\n{\n\nlong product = 1;\n\nforeach (int number in numbers)\n\n{\n\nproduct *= number;\n\n}\n\nreturn product;\n\n}\n\nstatic double CalculateAverage(List<int> numbers)\n\n{\n\nint sum = CalculateSum(numbers);\n\nreturn (double)sum / numbers.Count;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to implement this code, test it, and make sure it works as expected.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a C# console application that repeatedly prompts the user to enter integers between 1 and 100 until they enter -1. The program should then calculate and display the sum, product, and average of the entered numbers, excluding -1. We must ensure proper input validation and error handling.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Use a loop to continuously prompt the user for input until -1 is entered.\n2. **Validation**: Validate that the input is an integer within the range 1 to 100 or -1 to exit.\n3. **Calculations**: Compute the sum, product, and average of the valid numbers entered.\n4. **Error Handling**: Handle cases where non-integer values are entered or numbers outside the valid range are provided.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        List<int> numbers = new List<int>();\n\n        while (true)\n        {\n            int number = ReadAndValidateInput();\n            if (number == -1)\n            {\n                break;\n            }\n            else if (number >= 1 && number <= 100)\n            {\n                numbers.Add(number);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter an integer between 1 and 100 or -1 to finish.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (numbers.Count == 0)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"No numbers were entered.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            int sum = CalculateSum(numbers);\n            long product = CalculateProduct(numbers);\n            double average = CalculateAverage(numbers);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Sum: \" + sum);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Product: \" + product);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Average: \" + average.ToString(\"F2\"));\n        }\n    }\n\n    static int ReadAndValidateInput()\n    {\n        while (true)\n        {\n            Console.Write(\"Enter an integer between 1 and 100, or -1 to finish: \");\n            string input = Console.ReadLine();\n            if (int.TryParse(input, out int number))\n            {\n                return number;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    static int CalculateSum(List<int> numbers)\n    {\n        int sum = 0;\n        foreach (int number in numbers)\n        {\n            sum += number;\n        }\n        return sum;\n    }\n\n    static long CalculateProduct(List<int> numbers)\n    {\n        long product = 1;\n        foreach (int number in numbers)\n        {\n            product *= number;\n        }\n        return product;\n    }\n\n    static double CalculateAverage(List<int> numbers)\n    {\n        int sum = CalculateSum(numbers);\n        return (double)sum / numbers.Count;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling and Validation**:\n   - The `ReadAndValidateInput` method ensures that the user inputs a valid integer. It repeatedly prompts the user until a valid integer is entered.\n   - The main loop continues to ask for input until -1 is entered. It validates that the number is within 1 to 100 or exactly -1.\n\n2. **Calculations**:\n   - **Sum**: Iterates through the list of numbers and adds them up.\n   - **Product**: Iterates through the list and multiplies the numbers, using `long` to handle larger products.\n   - **Average**: Computes the sum and divides by the count of numbers, casting to `double` for accurate division.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - Displays the sum, product, and average of the entered numbers, with the average formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program is robust, handling invalid inputs gracefully and providing clear instructions to the user."
