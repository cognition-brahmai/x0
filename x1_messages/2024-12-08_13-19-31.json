Among the options provided, the key consideration in modern urban planning is D: Balancing environmental sustainability and social equity.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is crucial in urban planning as cities are major contributors to climate change, accounting for a significant portion of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, planners focus on reducing the environmental impact of cities through strategies such as promoting green spaces, encouraging public transportation and non-motorized transport, improving energy efficiency in buildings, and managing waste effectively.\n\nSocial equity is another critical aspect, ensuring that urban development benefits all residents, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, or other demographic factors. This includes providing affordable housing, equitable access to services and amenities, and opportunities for community participation in decision-making processes.\n\nOption A, maximizing the number of high-rise buildings, is not necessarily a key consideration in modern urban planning. While high-rise buildings can help manage space in dense urban areas, they may also lead to issues such as overshadowing, reduced green spaces, and social isolation if not planned carefully.\n\nOption B, ensuring all residents have a car, is contrary to the principles of modern urban planning, which often aim to reduce car dependency to alleviate traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote healthier lifestyles through walking and cycling.\n\nOption C, prioritizing commercial development over residential areas, may be a strategy in some contexts but is not a universal key consideration in modern urban planning. In fact, a balanced approach that considers the needs of both residents and businesses is generally preferred to create vibrant, mixed-use neighborhoods.\n\nIn conclusion, balancing environmental sustainability and social equity is a fundamental aspect of modern urban planning, aiming to create cities that are not only ecologically responsible but also just and inclusive for all residents."
