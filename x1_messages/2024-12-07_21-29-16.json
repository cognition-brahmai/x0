It features competitions in lots of different sports and disciplines. I believe you're talking about the Olympic Games.\n\nThe Olympic Games are a major international event comprising summer and winter sports, occurring every four years. The summer Olympics and the winter Olympics are each held every four years, but they are staggered so that they take place in alternating even-numbered years. For example, the summer Olympics are held in years like 2020 and 2024, while the winter Olympics are in 2022 and 2026.\n\nThe idea behind the modern Olympics was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. The modern version was launched by a Frenchman named Pierre de Coubertin in the late 19th century, and the first modern Olympics took place in Athens, Greece, in 1896, just as you mentioned.\n\nThese games bring together thousands of athletes from around the world to compete in a variety of sports, ranging from athletics (track and field) to swimming, gymnastics, basketball, soccer, and many more. The event is a huge celebration of sport, with the Olympic motto being \"Faster, Higher, Stronger,\" although recently it was updated to \"Faster, Higher, Stronger \u2014 Together,\" emphasizing unity and cooperation among nations.\n\nEach edition of the Olympics is hosted by a different city, which is selected through a bidding process managed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The host city is responsible for organizing and hosting the games, including building or renovating sports venues and accommodating the large number of athletes, officials, and spectators who come from all over the globe.\n\nThe Olympics are not just about sports; they also have a significant cultural component. The opening and closing ceremonies are renowned for their spectacular displays of art, culture, and technology, showcasing the host nation's heritage and values to the world.\n\nMoreover, the Olympics have a rich history of inspiring national pride and fostering international friendship and understanding. They provide a platform for athletes to showcase their skills and achieve personal excellence, often becoming role models and inspirations for future generations.\n\nIn recent years, the Olympics have also faced various challenges, such as issues related to doping, political controversies, and the financial burden of hosting the games. Despite these challenges, the Olympic Games remain one of the most prestigious and widely watched sporting events in the world.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the major international sporting event you're referring to is indeed the Olympic Games, which started in Athens in 1896 and continues to be held every four years, featuring a wide range of sports and disciplines from around the globe."
