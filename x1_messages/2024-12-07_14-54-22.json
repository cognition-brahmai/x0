Chefs often wear white jackets for several reasons. One reason is that white symbolizes cleanliness and purity in many cultures, which is important in a profession where food safety is paramount. Additionally, white fabric can help reflect heat from the hot kitchen environment, keeping the chef cooler. The jacket is also designed to be durable and easy to clean, as it may come into contact with food spills and splatters. Overall, the white jacket has become a traditional and practical part of a chef's uniform."
