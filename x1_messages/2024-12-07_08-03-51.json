        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a dog that gives birth to 6 puppies. So, initially, there's the mother dog and her 6 puppies. That makes a total of 1 (mother) + 6 (puppies) = 7 dogs.\n\nNow, each of these 6 puppies grows up and also gives birth to 6 puppies each. So, each of the 6 puppies becomes a mother to 6 new puppies. That means there are 6 (original puppies) * 6 (new puppies each) = 36 new puppies.\n\nAdding these 36 new puppies to the original 7 dogs, we get 7 + 36 = 43 dogs in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The original mother dog had 6 puppies. Those 6 puppies each have their own 6 puppies, adding 36 more dogs. So, altogether, it should be the original mother (1), her first litter (6), and their litters (36), which sums up to 1 + 6 + 36 = 43 dogs.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in generations. Generation 0 is just the original mother dog (1). Generation 1 is her 6 puppies. Generation 2 is the puppies of those 6 puppies, which is 6 * 6 = 36 puppies.\n\nSo, the total number of dogs is the sum of all generations: Generation 0 + Generation 1 + Generation 2 = 1 + 6 + 36 = 43 dogs.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that each dog gives birth to 6 puppies, and this happens twice: once for the original mother and once for each of her 6 puppies.\n\nSo, total dogs = original mother + first litter + second litter = 1 + 6 + (6 * 6) = 1 + 6 + 36 = 43.\n\nI think that's correct. But to be thorough, let's consider if there's another perspective or if we're missing something.\n\nIs there any overlap or are we double-counting any dogs? No, each generation is distinct: the original mother, her puppies, and her puppies' puppies.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the problem implies that the original mother dog also gives birth again, but according to the problem, it's only the original mother and then her puppies who each give birth to 6 puppies. So, the original mother doesn't have another litter; it's just her first litter's puppies that reproduce.\n\nTherefore, the total number of dogs is indeed 43.\n\nWait, but let's think about it in terms of exponential growth. Each dog has 6 offspring, and this happens for two generations beyond the original mother.\n\nSo, it's like a branching factor of 6 for each reproducing dog.\n\nGeneration 0: 1 dog (original mother)\n\nGeneration 1: 6 dogs (first litter)\n\nGeneration 2: 6 * 6 = 36 dogs (second litter)\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 + 36 = 43 dogs.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the formula for the total number of descendants in a branching process, it's the sum of the geometric series: total = 1 + r + r^2, where r is the branching factor (number of offspring per individual).\n\nHere, r = 6, and we have 2 generations of reproduction beyond the original mother.\n\nSo, total = 1 + 6 + 36 = 43.\n\nIf we were to generalize this, the formula would be total = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), where n is the number of generations of reproduction.\n\nIn this case, r = 6, n = 2, so total = (6^{3} - 1)/(6 - 1) = (216 - 1)/5 = 215/5 = 43.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of dogs, including the original mother, is 43.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{43} \\]"
