        "content": "In aerospace engineering, the term \"flutter\" refers to the self-excited oscillation of an aircraft structure due to aerodynamic forces. So, the correct answer is B.\n\nFlutter is a dangerous phenomenon that can lead to structural failure if not properly accounted for in the design and testing phases of an aircraft. It occurs when there is a feedback loop between the aerodynamic forces acting on a structure and the structural dynamics of that component. Essentially, the aerodynamic forces cause the structure to deform, which in turn changes the aerodynamic forces, leading to further deformation, and so on. This can result in divergent oscillations that can cause severe damage or even break the structure apart.\n\nA common example of flutter is the vibration of an aircraft's wings during flight, but it's important to note that flutter can affect any part of the aircraft that is exposed to airflow and has some degree of flexibility, such as control surfaces, stabilizers, or even the entire airframe in extreme cases.\n\nEngineers use various methods to analyze and prevent flutter, including wind tunnel tests, flight tests, and computational simulations. They design aircraft with sufficient stiffness and damping to ensure that flutter does not occur within the operational flight envelope. In some cases, special devices like mass balances or dampers are added to control surfaces to shift the flutter boundaries outside the normal flight conditions.\n\nUnderstanding and mitigating flutter is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of aircraft, as well as other structures exposed to airflow, such as bridges and tall buildings."
