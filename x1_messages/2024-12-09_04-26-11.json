        "content": "Creating a multi-client chat application using Java sockets involves setting up both a server and multiple client applications. The server will manage connections from multiple clients and broadcast messages received from one client to all others.\n\nBelow is a step-by-step guide to creating this application:\n\n### 1. Server Setup\n\nThe server will:\n\n- Listen for incoming client connections.\n- Handle each client in a separate thread.\n- Broadcast messages from one client to all other connected clients.\n\n#### Server Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ChatServer {\n    private static final int PORT = 12345;\n    private static List<ClientHandler> clients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Server started on port \" + PORT);\n\n        while (true) {\n            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n            ClientHandler client = new ClientHandler(socket);\n            clients.add(client);\n            new Thread(client).start();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void broadcastMessage(String message, ClientHandler sender) {\n        for (ClientHandler client : clients) {\n            if (client != sender) {\n                client.sendMessage(message);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n        private Socket socket;\n        private PrintWriter out;\n        private BufferedReader in;\n\n        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {\n            this.socket = socket;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            try {\n                in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n                out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n                String message;\n                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Received: \" + message);\n                    broadcastMessage(message, this);\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            } finally {\n                try {\n                    socket.close();\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n                clients.remove(this);\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void sendMessage(String message) {\n            out.println(message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Client Setup\n\nThe client will:\n\n- Connect to the server.\n- Send messages to the server.\n- Receive and display messages from the server.\n\n#### Client Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class ChatClient {\n    private static final String SERVER_ADDRESS = \"localhost\";\n    private static final int PORT = 12345;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        Socket socket = new Socket(SERVER_ADDRESS, PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Connected to server\");\n\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n        Thread readThread = new Thread(() -> {\n            try {\n                String message;\n                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Received: \" + message);\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        });\n        readThread.start();\n\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n            String message = scanner.nextLine();\n            out.println(message);\n        }\n\n        socket.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Explanation\n\n- **Server**:\n  - Listens on a specified port for incoming client connections.\n  - For each client, it creates a new thread using `ClientHandler` to handle communication.\n  - Broadcasts messages received from one client to all other connected clients.\n\n- **Client**:\n  - Connects to the server on the specified address and port.\n  - Reads user input from the console and sends it to the server.\n  - Listens for incoming messages from the server and prints them to the console.\n\n### 4. Running the Application\n\n1. **Start the Server**:\n   - Compile the `ChatServer` class.\n   - Run the `ChatServer` class. It will start listening for connections.\n\n2. **Start Multiple Clients**:\n   - Compile the `ChatClient` class.\n   - Run multiple instances of the `ChatClient` class.\n   - Type messages in any client window and see them broadcast to all other connected clients.\n\nThis setup provides a basic multi-client chat application using Java sockets. For a production-level application, consider adding features like user authentication, better error handling, and potentially using more efficient networking libraries."
