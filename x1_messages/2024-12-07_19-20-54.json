        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a bottle contains 500 ml of water, and each glass holds 200 ml. I need to figure out how many glasses can be filled from that bottle. Hmm, seems straightforward, but I think I'll explore this a bit more to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nFirst off, the total volume of water in the bottle is 500 ml, and each glass can hold 200 ml. So, the most direct approach would be to divide the total volume by the volume per glass. That is, 500 ml divided by 200 ml per glass. Let's do that: 500 \u00f7 200 equals 2.5. So, theoretically, you could fill 2.5 glasses.\n\nBut wait, you can't really have half a glass, can you? I mean, in practical terms, you can have a half-filled glass, but the question is probably expecting a whole number of glasses. So, perhaps the answer is 2 full glasses.\n\nHowever, if we consider that the last portion might still be useful, even if it's not a full glass, then maybe saying 2.5 glasses is acceptable. But since glasses are typically considered in whole numbers when filling, maybe 2 is the better answer.\n\nLet me think differently. If I pour 200 ml into each glass, how many times can I do that from 500 ml? First glass: 200 ml, leaving 300 ml. Second glass: another 200 ml, leaving 100 ml. Now, I have 100 ml left, which is not enough to fill another 200 ml glass. So, only 2 full glasses can be filled.\n\nBut, if the glasses are not required to be completely full, then perhaps you could have a third glass that's half full. But again, the problem might be expecting the number of full glasses that can be poured.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a consideration about the bottle's shape or neck size that affects how completely it can be emptied, but that seems like an overcomplication unless specified.\n\nLet me consider units. Everything is in milliliters, so no need to convert units, which is good.\n\nAnother angle: if the glasses are to be filled to the brim, then only 2 glasses can be fully filled from the bottle. If the glasses can be filled to less than their capacity, then 2.5 glasses could be \"filled\" in a sense, but not completely.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider that only full glasses are counted. So, 2 full glasses can be poured, and there will be 100 ml of water left in the bottle.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't specify that the glasses need to be full. It just says \"how many glasses can be filled?\" So, maybe filling them partially is allowed.\n\nIn that case, 2 full glasses use 400 ml, leaving 100 ml in the bottle. That 100 ml could fill another glass partially, making it 3 glasses in total, but the third one would be only half full.\n\nHowever, if we consider that a glass is considered filled as long as it has some water, even if not full, then 3 glasses could be \"filled,\" but that seems a bit loose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider only full glasses. To be safe, perhaps I should consider both possibilities.\n\nLet me try another approach. If each glass holds 200 ml, and I have 500 ml, how many 200 ml portions are there in 500 ml? Well, 500 divided by 200 is 2.5. So, again, 2.5 portions.\n\nBut since we can't have half a glass in practical terms, perhaps the answer should be 2 full glasses.\n\nAlternatively, if we're to consider the number of glasses that can be filled to some amount, even if not full, then it's 2 full glasses and one partially filled glass, totaling 3 glasses.\n\nBut, in terms of standard division, 500 \u00f7 200 = 2.5, which could be interpreted as 2 full glasses and half a glass, but perhaps in practical terms, you'd have 2 full glasses and one half-full glass, making it 3 glasses in total.\n\nWait, but is a half-full glass considered a filled glass? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing basic division skills, and the answer is simply 2.5.\n\nBut since we're dealing with physical glasses, which can't be half a glass, maybe the answer should be 2 full glasses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the third glass is still filled with 100 ml, which is half its capacity, perhaps it's acceptable to count it as a half glass, but the problem might be expecting a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2 full glasses and a remainder of 100 ml, but that might not be the format expected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as how many 200 ml portions are there in 500 ml, which is 2.5.\n\nBut since we can't have half a glass, perhaps the answer is 2 full glasses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mathematical terms, it's 2.5 glasses, but in practical terms, it's 2 full glasses and one half-full glass.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting the mathematical answer of 2.5 glasses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as how many glasses can be filled without exceeding the total volume, which would be 2 glasses.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should look at similar problems for guidance.\n\nSuppose I have another problem: if I have 5 dollars and each toy costs 2 dollars, how many toys can I buy? Well, 5 \u00f7 2 = 2.5, but I can't buy half a toy, so I can buy 2 toys and have 1 dollar left.\n\nSimilarly, here, I can fill 2 glasses completely and have 100 ml left, which isn't enough for another full glass.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is 2 glasses.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows for partial glasses, then it's 2 full glasses and one half glass, totaling 3 glasses.\n\nBut the problem says \"filled,\" which could imply completely filled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"filled\" just means containing some water, in which case, 3 glasses could be considered filled.\n\nBut I think the safer assumption is that \"filled\" means completely filled, especially since the glass has a specified capacity.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is 2 glasses can be completely filled from the bottle.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider the possibility of the glasses not being filled to the brim.\n\nIf that's allowed, then 3 glasses could be filled, with the third one being half full.\n\nBut again, the problem specifies that each glass holds 200 ml, which likely implies that they are to be filled to that capacity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to assess understanding of division and rounding down.\n\nIn any case, I think the most reasonable answer is 2 glasses can be completely filled from the bottle.\n\nSo, my final answer is [B] 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
