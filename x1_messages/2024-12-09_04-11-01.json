He leaves the classroom for lunch and asks Tom, one of his students, to organize the books by color while he's gone. Tom sorts the books into four piles: red, blue, green, and yellow. After Tom finishes, another student, Alice, enters the room and decides to rearrange the books by size instead. When Mr. Johnson returns from lunch, he sees the books organized by size but doesn't know that Alice changed the arrangement. What does Mr. Johnson think about the way the books are sorted?"
