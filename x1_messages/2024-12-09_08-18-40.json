So, if every bird flies away except for one, that means only one bird is left on the fence. Right? So, the answer should be one bird.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard this kind of riddle before, and sometimes there are tricks involved. Maybe there's something more to it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the riddle is playing with words or there's a tricky interpretation.\n\nLet me read it again: \"There are 100 birds sitting on a fence. If every bird flies away except for one, how many birds are left on the fence?\"\n\nOkay, so it says \"every bird flies away except for one.\" That seems pretty straightforward. If there were 100 birds and all but one fly away, then only one remains. So, the answer should be one bird.\n\nBut maybe there's a different perspective. Maybe the exception is that one bird doesn't fly away because it's already not on the fence. For example, perhaps one bird was already flying and not sitting on the fence, so when every bird flies away except for one, that one is the one that was already flying. So, in that case, how many birds are left on the fence? None, because all 100 flew away, including the one that was already flying.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let's stick to the original interpretation. The riddle says \"every bird flies away except for one.\" So, out of the 100 birds, all fly away except for one bird. That means one bird remains on the fence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the one bird that doesn't fly away is because it's dead or unable to fly. So, it's still on the fence. In that case, one bird is left on the fence.\n\nBut I think the simplest and most straightforward answer is one bird remains on the fence.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Perhaps the riddle is about the nature of exceptions. If every bird flies away except for one, it could imply that only one bird stays behind for some reason.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the riddle is testing whether you understand that \"except for one\" means that one bird does not fly away, so it remains on the fence.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a play on words with \"except for one.\" Maybe it's not specifying that one bird doesn't fly away, but rather that one bird is exceptions to flying away.\n\nBut I think the most logical interpretation is that one bird does not fly away and remains on the fence.\n\nSo, my final answer is one bird is left on the fence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
