        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 2000 units of product X each day, and each unit of X needs 3 units of raw material Y. So, first, I need to find out how much raw material Y is used per day.\n\nIf one unit of X requires 3 units of Y, then 2000 units of X would require 2000 times 3 units of Y. That would be:\n\n2000 units of X * 3 units of Y/unit of X = 6000 units of Y per day.\n\nNow, there are 18,000 units of Y available. To find out how many days the factory can continue producing product X without running out of Y, I need to divide the total available Y by the daily usage of Y.\n\nSo, 18,000 units of Y / 6000 units of Y per day = 3 days.\n\nTherefore, the factory can continue producing product X for 3 days without running out of raw material Y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
