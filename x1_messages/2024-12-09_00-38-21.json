        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a simple task management REST API using Node.js. We'll store the tasks in a JSON file on the server. Sounds good?\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org if you haven't already.\n\nLet's start by setting up a new Node.js project. Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project:\n\n```\nmkdir task-api\ncd task-api\n```\n\nNow, initialize a new Node.js project:\n\n```\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis will create a `package.json` file with default settings.\n\nNext, we need to install some dependencies. We'll use Express for creating the API, and Body-parser to handle JSON data in requests.\n\nInstall Express and Body-parser:\n\n```\nnpm install express body-parser\n```\n\nNow, let's create the main server file. Create a new file called `server.js` in your project directory.\n\nOpen `server.js` and set up the basic Express app:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\nGreat! Now, we need to create a JSON file to store our tasks. Create a file named `tasks.json` in the project directory with the following content:\n\n```json\n[]\n```\n\nThis is an empty array where we'll store our tasks.\n\nNext, we need to set up routes for creating, updating, deleting, and listing tasks.\n\nLet's start with the endpoint to list all tasks. We'll create a GET route at `/tasks`.\n\nAdd this to `server.js`:\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/tasks', (req, res) => {\n  const tasks = require('./tasks.json');\n  res.json(tasks);\n});\n```\n\nNow, let's create a POST route to create a new task. We'll expect the task data in the request body.\n\nAdd this to `server.js`:\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/tasks', (req, res) => {\n  const tasks = require('./tasks.json');\n  const newTask = req.body;\n  tasks.push(newTask);\n  saveTasks(tasks);\n  res.status(201).json(newTask);\n});\n\nfunction saveTasks(tasks) {\n  const fs = require('fs');\n  fs.writeFileSync('./tasks.json', JSON.stringify(tasks, null, 2));\n}\n```\n\nHere, we're reading the existing tasks, adding the new task to the array, and then writing the updated array back to the JSON file.\n\nNext, let's create a PUT route to update a task's status. We'll assume that each task has a unique ID.\n\nAdd this to `server.js`:\n\n```javascript\napp.put('/tasks/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const tasks = require('./tasks.json');\n  const taskId = req.params.id;\n  const updatedStatus = req.body.status;\n\n  const taskIndex = tasks.findIndex(task => task.id === taskId);\n  if (taskIndex === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Task not found' });\n  }\n\n  tasks[taskIndex].status = updatedStatus;\n  saveTasks(tasks);\n  res.json(tasks[taskIndex]);\n});\n```\n\nIn this route, we find the task by its ID and update its status based on the request body.\n\nNow, let's create a DELETE route to remove a task.\n\nAdd this to `server.js`:\n\n```javascript\napp.delete('/tasks/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const tasks = require('./tasks.json');\n  const taskId = req.params.id;\n\n  const taskIndex = tasks.findIndex(task => task.id === taskId);\n  if (taskIndex === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Task not found' });\n  }\n\n  const deletedTask = tasks.splice(taskIndex, 1);\n  saveTasks(tasks);\n  res.json(deletedTask[0]);\n});\n```\n\nHere, we find the task by ID, remove it from the array, and save the updated array.\n\nAlmost there! Let's make sure that the task IDs are unique. We can generate UUIDs for task IDs.\n\nFirst, install the uuid package:\n\n```\nnpm install uuid\n```\n\nThen, require it in `server.js` and use it when creating new tasks.\n\nUpdate the POST route to include a unique ID:\n\n```javascript\nconst uuid = require('uuid');\n\napp.post('/tasks', (req, res) => {\n  const tasks = require('./tasks.json');\n  const newTask = {\n    id: uuid.v4(),\n    title: req.body.title,\n    description: req.body.description,\n    status: req.body.status || 'pending'\n  };\n  tasks.push(newTask);\n  saveTasks(tasks);\n  res.status(201).json(newTask);\n});\n```\n\nAssuming that each task has a title, description, and status, with status defaulting to 'pending' if not provided.\n\nAlso, update the GET route to include the task ID in the response:\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/tasks', (req, res) => {\n  const tasks = require('./tasks.json');\n  res.json(tasks);\n});\n```\n\nNow, your API should be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks.\n\nLet's test it out. Start your server by running:\n\n```\nnode server.js\n```\n\nYou can use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints.\n\nFor example, to create a new task, send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/tasks` with a JSON body like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Buy groceries\",\n  \"description\": \"Milk, eggs, bread\",\n  \"status\": \"pending\"\n}\n```\n\nTo list all tasks, send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/tasks`.\n\nTo update a task's status, send a PUT request to `http://localhost:3000/tasks/{id}` with a JSON body like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"completed\"\n}\n```\n\nReplace `{id}` with the actual task ID.\n\nTo delete a task, send a DELETE request to `http://localhost:3000/tasks/{id}`.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple task management API using Node.js and storing data in a JSON file.\n\nRemember, in a production environment, you'd want to use a proper database instead of a JSON file for better performance and scalability.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
