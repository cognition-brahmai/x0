        "content": "So there's this problem: in a room with 10 people, everyone shakes hands with each other exactly once. The question is, how many handshakes happen in total? Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are 10 people, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, no repeats, and no shaking hands with yourself, I assume.\n\nMaybe I can start by thinking about a smaller group and see if I can find a pattern or a formula that applies to larger groups, like 10 people.\n\nLet's say there are 2 people in the room. Person A and Person B. They shake hands with each other once. So, total handshakes: 1.\n\nNow, if there are 3 people: Person A, B, and C. A shakes hands with B and C, and B shakes hands with C. So, that's A-B, A-C, and B-C. Total handshakes: 3.\n\nWait, is there a pattern here? With 2 people, 1 handshake. With 3 people, 3 handshakes.\n\nLet me try with 4 people: A, B, C, D.\n\nA shakes hands with B, C, D: that's 3 handshakes.\n\nB shakes hands with C and D (but not with A again), so that's 2 more handshakes.\n\nC shakes hands with D (not with A or B again), so 1 more handshake.\n\nTotal: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 handshakes.\n\nHmm, interesting. With 4 people, 6 handshakes.\n\nLet me see with 5 people: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nA shakes with B, C, D, E: 4 handshakes.\n\nB shakes with C, D, E (not A again): 3 handshakes.\n\nC shakes with D, E (not A or B again): 2 handshakes.\n\nD shakes with E (not A, B, or C again): 1 handshake.\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes.\n\nOkay, so for 5 people, 10 handshakes.\n\nLet me summarize what I have so far:\n\n- 2 people: 1 handshake\n\n- 3 people: 3 handshakes\n\n- 4 people: 6 handshakes\n\n- 5 people: 10 handshakes\n\nI notice that each time, the number of handshakes is the sum of all integers from 1 up to one less than the number of people.\n\nFor example:\n\n- With 2 people: 1\n\n- With 3 people: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- With 4 people: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n\n- With 5 people: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, for n people, the total number of handshakes seems to be the sum of the first (n-1) positive integers.\n\nI recall that the sum of the first k positive integers is given by the formula:\n\nSum = k(k + 1)/2\n\nBut in this case, k is (n - 1), where n is the number of people.\n\nSo, substituting k with (n - 1), the total number of handshakes (H) would be:\n\nH = (n - 1)n/2\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me check with the earlier examples.\n\nFor n = 2:\n\nH = (2 - 1)*2/2 = 1*2/2 = 1, which matches.\n\nFor n = 3:\n\nH = (3 - 1)*3/2 = 2*3/2 = 6/2 = 3, which matches.\n\nFor n = 4:\n\nH = (4 - 1)*4/2 = 3*4/2 = 12/2 = 6, which matches.\n\nFor n = 5:\n\nH = (5 - 1)*5/2 = 4*5/2 = 20/2 = 10, which matches.\n\nGreat, so this formula seems to work.\n\nNow, applying this to the original problem with 10 people:\n\nH = (10 - 1)*10/2 = 9*10/2 = 90/2 = 45 handshakes.\n\nSo, there are 45 handshakes in total.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using combinations.\n\nI know that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items out of n is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n - 2)!)\n\nThis represents the number of unique pairs that can be formed from n items, which is exactly what we have here, since each handshake is a unique pair of people.\n\nLet me calculate C(10, 2):\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10*9*8!)/(2*1*8!)/(8! cancels out) = (10*9)/(2*1) = 90/2 = 45\n\nAgain, 45 handshakes, which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't any double-counting or missing handshakes.\n\nIn the initial approach, where we add up the series, each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, and by summing up, we avoid double-counting because each subsequent person only shakes hands with those who haven't shaken hands with them yet.\n\nIn the combination approach, C(n, 2) inherently avoids double-counting because it counts unique pairs.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the total number of handshakes is 45.\n\nJust to explore a bit more, I wonder if there's a general formula for any number of people.\n\nYes, as I found, H = n(n - 1)/2, where n is the number of people.\n\nThis is equivalent to C(n, 2).\n\nIt's interesting to see how different methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI think that's thorough enough for this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
