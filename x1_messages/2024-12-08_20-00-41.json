However, one thing they might generally agree on is that there are hidden truths or agendas that are not being revealed by official sources. They often believe that governments, corporations, or other powerful entities are withholding information or manipulating events for their own benefit. So, in a broad sense, the idea that there are conspiracies at play beyond what is openly acknowledged could be a common thread among many conspiracy theorists."
