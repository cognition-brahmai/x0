        "content": "Let's see here. So, there are five friends going out for dinner, and they planned to split the bill evenly. But, uh-oh, two of them forgot their wallets, so only three friends have money to pay. The total bill is $150. I need to figure out how much each of the three friends who have their wallets needs to pay.\n\nFirst, if everyone had their wallets, they would split the $150 evenly among the five friends. So, each person would pay $150 divided by 5, which is $30. But since two friends forgot their wallets, only three friends are paying. So, the total amount to be paid is still $150, but it's now divided among three friends.\n\nSo, $150 divided by 3 is $50. That means each of the three friends who have their wallets needs to pay $50.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe to see how much extra the three friends are paying because two aren't contributing.\n\nOriginally, each was supposed to pay $30. But now, the three friends have to cover the $30 that each of the two friends would have paid. So, the two friends who forgot their wallets would have paid a total of $30 times 2, which is $60.\n\nSo, the three friends need to cover their own $30 plus the $60 that the other two would have paid. That means each of the three friends pays their $30 plus a share of the $60.\n\nTo find out how much each of the three friends pays additionally, we divide the $60 by the three friends, which is $20 each.\n\nSo, $30 (their original share) plus $20 (the additional amount to cover the others) equals $50 per friend.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by dividing the total bill by three.\n\nSo, yes, each of the three friends who brought their wallets has to pay $50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
