        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (4^2 - 3 * 5) / (6 + 2 * 7). First, I need to calculate the numerator and the denominator separately, following the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 4^2 - 3 * 5.\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent: 4^2 = 16.\n\nNow the expression is 16 - 3 * 5.\n\nNext, perform the multiplication: 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nSo now it's 16 - 15.\n\nSubtract: 16 - 15 = 1.\n\nSo the numerator is 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the denominator: 6 + 2 * 7.\n\nFirst, perform the multiplication: 2 * 7 = 14.\n\nNow the expression is 6 + 14.\n\nAdd: 6 + 14 = 20.\n\nSo the denominator is 20.\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator: 1 / 20.\n\nThat equals 0.05.\n\nSo, the final answer is 0.05.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.05} \\]"
