        "content": "Istanbul is located in Turkey, which is a transcontinental country mostly in Asia but also including a small portion in Europe. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan, and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The country is also surrounded by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. The city of Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historical center. It's a fascinating place with a rich history, blending elements of both European and Asian cultures."
