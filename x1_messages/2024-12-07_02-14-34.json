        "content": "So the gardener has to plant 10 trees in a row, and each tree is either an apple or a pear. The condition is that no two apple trees can be next to each other. I need to figure out the maximum number of apple trees that can be planted under this rule.\n\nFirst, I should understand the constraint: no two apple trees can be adjacent. That means between any two apple trees, there must be at least one pear tree.\n\nLet me think about how to arrange the trees to maximize the number of apple trees while respecting this condition.\n\nOne way to approach this is to place an apple tree and then a pear tree alternately. For example, starting with an apple tree:\n\nApple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear.\n\nIn this arrangement, there are 5 apple trees and 5 pear trees, and no two apple trees are next to each other.\n\nIs it possible to have more than 5 apple trees?\n\nIf I try to add another apple tree, say in the second position:\n\nApple, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple.\n\nBut wait, now the first two trees are both apple trees, which violates the condition that no two apple trees can be adjacent.\n\nSo, this arrangement is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different pattern that allows more apple trees.\n\nLet me consider starting with a pear tree:\n\nPear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple.\n\nAgain, this gives 5 apple trees and 5 pear trees, with no two apple trees adjacent.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIs there a way to arrange them to have 6 apple trees?\n\nLet's try:\n\nApple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple.\n\nWait, that's 6 apple trees and 5 pear trees, but I only have space for 10 trees. So that would be:\n\nApple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear.\n\nBut that's 5 apple trees and 5 pear trees again.\n\nOh, I see. If I try to add a sixth apple tree, I would need to place it somewhere, but every position is either adjacent to an apple tree or already occupied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place two pear trees between some apple trees to create more spaces for apples.\n\nFor example:\n\nApple, Pear, Pear, Apple, Pear, Pear, Apple, Pear, Pear, Apple.\n\nHere, I have 4 apple trees and 6 pear trees. But that's fewer apple trees than before.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different pattern.\n\nLet me think differently. If I consider the pear trees as separators, then between each pair of pear trees, I can place at most one apple tree.\n\nWait, not quite. The condition is about apple trees not being adjacent, so I need to ensure that there is at least one pear tree between any two apple trees.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of apple trees, I need to place them with exactly one pear tree between them.\n\nLike: Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear, Apple, Pear.\n\nThat's 5 apple trees and 5 pear trees.\n\nAlternatively, if I have more pear trees, I can have more separators, potentially allowing more apple trees.\n\nBut in practice, adding more pear trees doesn't help because the apple trees are already maximized with alternating positions.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of sequences.\n\nLet me model this mathematically.\n\nLet\u2019s denote A as apple tree and P as pear tree.\n\nWe have a sequence of 10 trees: position 1 to 10.\n\nConstraint: no two A's are adjacent.\n\nI need to maximize the number of A's in the sequence.\n\nThis sounds like a classic problem in combinatorics or discrete mathematics.\n\nOne way to approach this is to think of placing A's with at least one P between them.\n\nSo, if I place an A, then I must place a P after it before placing another A.\n\nEssentially, each A requires a P to follow it, except possibly the last A.\n\nWait, but that's not quite accurate.\n\nActually, the condition is that no two A's are adjacent, so between any two A's, there must be at least one P.\n\nBut the P can be on either side of the A's.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think of placing A's in the sequence such that there is at least one P between them.\n\nAlternatively, think of placing A's in the gaps created by P's.\n\nLet me consider the positions where A's can be placed.\n\nIf I have n P's, then there are (n+1) possible gaps where A's can be placed (before the first P, between P's, and after the last P).\n\nBut in this case, since the trees are in a row, and we have a fixed number of positions, maybe it's better to think in terms of placing A's with P's separating them.\n\nLet me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s say I have k A's to place in 10 positions, with the condition that no two A's are adjacent.\n\nThat means, between any two A's, there is at least one P.\n\nSo, if I have k A's, then I need at least (k-1) P's to separate them.\n\nAdditionally, there can be P's before the first A and after the last A.\n\nSo, the total number of P's required is at least (k-1).\n\nBut I have a total of 10 trees, so:\n\nNumber of P's = 10 - k.\n\nThis must be greater than or equal to (k-1):\n\n10 - k >= k - 1.\n\nSolving for k:\n\n10 - k >= k - 1\n\n10 + 1 >= k + k\n\n11 >= 2k\n\nk <= 5.5.\n\nSince k must be an integer, k <= 5.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of A's is 5.\n\nThis matches the earlier arrangement where I had 5 A's and 5 P's in an alternating pattern.\n\nIs there any way to have more than 5 A's?\n\nSuppose I try k = 6.\n\nThen, 10 - 6 = 4 P's.\n\nBut 4 < 6 - 1 = 5, which violates the inequality.\n\nHence, it's not possible to have 6 A's.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of apple trees is 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this problem in terms of graph theory or other mathematical models, but I think the combinatorial approach is sufficient here.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider another arrangement.\n\nSuppose I place A's in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.\n\nThen the sequence is:\n\nA, P, A, P, A, P, A, P, A, P.\n\nThis is 5 A's and 5 P's, with no two A's adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, I could place A's in positions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10:\n\nP, A, P, A, P, A, P, A, P, A.\n\nAgain, 5 A's with no two adjacent.\n\nIn both cases, I can't add a sixth A without violating the condition.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of apple trees is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
