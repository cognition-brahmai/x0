        "content": "So the hospital has 250 patients and wants a patient-to-nurse ratio of 4:1. That means for every 4 patients, there should be 1 nurse. First, I need to find out how many nurses are needed without considering the part-time staff.\n\nSo, if the ratio is 4:1, then the number of nurses required would be the total number of patients divided by 4. Let's do that calculation:\n\n250 patients \u00f7 4 = 62.5 nurses\n\nBut you can't have half a nurse, so probably they would need to round up to 63 nurses to cover all patients.\n\nNow, there's a complication because 10% of the nursing staff works part-time and can only cover half of a full-time nurse's workload. So, I need to account for that.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many nurses are part-time. If 10% of the staff is part-time, then:\n\nTotal nurses needed: let's call it N\n\nPart-time nurses: 10% of N, which is 0.1N\n\nFull-time nurses: 90% of N, which is 0.9N\n\nNow, each part-time nurse only covers half the workload of a full-time nurse. So, the effective number of full-time nurses is:\n\nEffective full-time nurses = full-time nurses + (part-time nurses \u00d7 0.5)\n\nWhich is:\n\n0.9N + (0.1N \u00d7 0.5) = 0.9N + 0.05N = 0.95N\n\nBut we know that the effective number of full-time nurses needs to be equal to the number of nurses required to achieve the patient-to-nurse ratio, which is 62.5.\n\nSo:\n\n0.95N = 62.5\n\nNow, solve for N:\n\nN = 62.5 \u00f7 0.95 \u2248 65.79\n\nAgain, you can't have a fraction of a nurse, so they would need to round up to 66 nurses in total.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nIf there are 66 total nurses:\n\nPart-time nurses: 10% of 66 = 6.6, round to 7 part-time nurses\n\nFull-time nurses: 66 - 7 = 59 nurses\n\nNow, the workload covered by part-time nurses: 7 \u00d7 0.5 = 3.5 full-time equivalent nurses\n\nSo, total full-time equivalent nurses: 59 + 3.5 = 62.5\n\nWhich matches the required 62.5 nurses.\n\nWait, but 10% of 66 is 6.6, which we rounded to 7. Let's see if 6 part-time nurses would be enough.\n\nIf total nurses N = 66\n\nPart-time nurses = 6.6, round to 7\n\nBut if we use 6 part-time nurses:\n\n6 \u00d7 0.5 = 3 full-time equivalent\n\nFull-time nurses: 66 - 6 = 60\n\nTotal full-time equivalent: 60 + 3 = 63\n\nBut we only needed 62.5, so 63 is slightly more, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we have 7 part-time nurses:\n\n7 \u00d7 0.5 = 3.5 full-time equivalent\n\nFull-time nurses: 66 - 7 = 59\n\nTotal full-time equivalent: 59 + 3.5 = 62.5\n\nWhich is exactly what's needed.\n\nSo, rounding up to 7 part-time nurses and 59 full-time nurses would meet the requirement.\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs a total of 66 nurses to achieve the desired patient-to-nurse ratio, considering that 10% of the staff is part-time and works half capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]"
