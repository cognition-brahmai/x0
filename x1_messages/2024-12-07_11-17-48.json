        "content": "Self-harm is a complex and multifaceted issue, and it's important to approach it with empathy and understanding. While some individuals may engage in self-harmful behaviors to seek attention, it is not accurate to generalize that self-harm is primarily attention-seeking. In many cases, self-harm is a coping mechanism used by individuals to deal with emotional pain, trauma, or overwhelming feelings. It can be a way to release pent-up emotions, punish themselves, or even to feel something when they are emotionally numb. It's crucial to recognize that self-harm is often a sign of underlying mental health issues and should be addressed with professional help and support rather than being dismissed as merely attention-seeking."
