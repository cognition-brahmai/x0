        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. The mayor says that even-numbered houses get a gift and odd-numbered houses have to pay a tax. But house number 13 is exempt from this rule because of superstition. I need to find out how many houses will receive a gift.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many even-numbered houses there are between 1 and 100. Even numbers are divisible by 2, so the even houses are 2, 4, 6, up to 100. To find the count, I can divide 100 by 2, which gives 50. So there are 50 even-numbered houses.\n\nBut wait, house number 13 is exempt from the rule. House 13 is odd-numbered, so according to the original rule, it would have to pay a tax. But since it's exempt, does that mean it doesn't have to pay a tax, or does it mean it gets a gift instead? The problem says it's exempt from the rule, but it doesn't specify what that exemption entails.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"all the even-numbered houses will receive a gift and all the odd-numbered houses will have to pay a tax. However, house number 13 is exempt from this rule due to superstition.\"\n\nSo, house 13 is odd-numbered, and normally would have to pay a tax. But it's exempt from the rule. Exempt means it's not subject to the rule, so it doesn't have to pay a tax. But the problem doesn't say anything about it receiving a gift. So, probably, house 13 doesn't pay a tax and doesn't receive a gift.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses that receive a gift should still be the number of even-numbered houses, which is 50, because house 13 is odd and exempt, but not receiving a gift.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if the exemption for house 13 affects the gift distribution. Perhaps being exempt means it can also receive a gift if it wants to, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nI think the safest interpretation is that house 13 is exempt from both the gift and the tax, meaning it neither receives a gift nor pays a tax.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses that receive a gift remains 50, which are the even-numbered houses, excluding house 13 if it were even, but since it's odd, it doesn't affect the count of even houses.\n\nSo, the answer should be 50 houses receive a gift.\n\nBut let me double-check. If house 13 were even, and it's exempt, then perhaps it wouldn't receive a gift, but since it's odd, and exempt, it doesn't have to pay a tax, but doesn't receive a gift.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nHere's another way to look at it:\n\n- Even houses: receive a gift.\n\n- Odd houses: pay a tax.\n\n- House 13: exempt from the above rules.\n\nSo, for house 13, since it's exempt, neither the gift nor the tax applies to it.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses receiving gifts is the number of even houses, which is 50, and house 13, being odd and exempt, doesn't receive a gift.\n\nSo, still, 50 houses receive gifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exemption for house 13 means it gets special treatment, but the problem doesn't specify what that special treatment is. The safest assumption is that it's exempt from both receiving a gift and paying a tax.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 50 houses receive gifts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
