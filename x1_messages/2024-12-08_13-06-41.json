        "content": "Let's find all the prime numbers between 60 and 80 first. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I'll list out the numbers from 61 to 79 and check which ones are prime.\n\nStarting with 61:\n\n- 61 is only divisible by 1 and 61, so it's prime.\n\nNext, 62:\n\n- 62 is even, so it's divisible by 2, hence not prime.\n\n63:\n\n- 63 is divisible by 3 (3*21), so not prime.\n\n64:\n\n- 64 is 8 squared, so it's not prime.\n\n65:\n\n- 65 is 5 times 13, so not prime.\n\n66:\n\n- 66 is even, divisible by 2, so not prime.\n\n67:\n\n- 67 is only divisible by 1 and 67, so it's prime.\n\n68:\n\n- 68 is even, divisible by 2, so not prime.\n\n69:\n\n- 69 is divisible by 3 (3*23), so not prime.\n\n70:\n\n- 70 is even, and also divisible by 5, so not prime.\n\n71:\n\n- 71 is only divisible by 1 and 71, so it's prime.\n\n72:\n\n- 72 is even, divisible by 2, so not prime.\n\n73:\n\n- 73 is only divisible by 1 and 73, so it's prime.\n\n74:\n\n- 74 is even, divisible by 2, so not prime.\n\n75:\n\n- 75 is divisible by 5 (5*15), so not prime.\n\n76:\n\n- 76 is even, divisible by 2, so not prime.\n\n77:\n\n- 77 is 7 times 11, so not prime.\n\n78:\n\n- 78 is even, divisible by 2, so not prime.\n\n79:\n\n- 79 is only divisible by 1 and 79, so it's prime.\n\nSo, the prime numbers between 60 and 80 are: 61, 67, 71, 73, 79.\n\nNow, to find their sum:\n\n61 + 67 = 128\n\n128 + 71 = 199\n\n199 + 73 = 272\n\n272 + 79 = 351\n\nTherefore, the sum of all prime numbers between 60 and 80 is 351.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{351} \\]"
