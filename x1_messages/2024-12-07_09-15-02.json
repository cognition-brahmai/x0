        "content": "Let's see. I have to figure out how tall a stack of one million US pennies would be, and I need to give the answer in feet. I know that each penny is 0.0598 inches thick. So, first things first, I should find out the total height in inches and then convert that to feet.\n\nOkay, so if one penny is 0.0598 inches thick, then one million pennies would be 1,000,000 times that thickness. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal height in inches = 1,000,000 pennies * 0.0598 inches/penny\n\nSo, 1,000,000 * 0.0598 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that. 1,000,000 times 0.0598. Well, multiplying by one million is the same as multiplying by 10^6, so I can move the decimal point six places to the right.\n\n0.0598 * 1,000,000 = 59,800 inches\n\nSo, the total height is 59,800 inches.\n\nNow, I need to convert inches to feet. I know that there are 12 inches in a foot. So, to find the height in feet, I'll divide the total inches by 12.\n\nHeight in feet = 59,800 inches / 12 inches/foot\n\nLet me do that division. 59,800 divided by 12.\n\nFirst, 12 times 4,983 is 59,796. That's close to 59,800. So, 4,983 feet with a remainder.\n\n59,800 - 59,796 = 4 inches\n\nSo, the height is 4,983 feet and 4 inches.\n\nBut maybe I should be more precise. Let's check the division again.\n\n59,800 \u00f7 12 = 4,983.333... feet\n\nSo, it's 4,983 feet and 0.333... feet. Since 0.333 feet times 12 inches per foot is about 4 inches, that matches what I had before.\n\nSo, the stack would be approximately 4,983 feet and 4 inches tall.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way to express this? Maybe I should consider significant figures. The thickness of a penny is given to four decimal places, 0.0598 inches, so that's four significant figures. One million is an exact number in this context. So, my answer should probably have four significant figures as well.\n\nLet's see, 4,983.333 feet. If I consider significant figures, it's already four significant figures. So, perhaps I can round it to 4,983 feet.\n\nBut, to be precise, since the decimal is 0.333, which is a third, it's repeating, so it's exactly one-third of a foot. And since one foot is 12 inches, one-third of a foot is 4 inches. So, saying 4,983 feet and 4 inches is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express it all in feet, I could say 4,983 and one-third feet.\n\nBut perhaps the question wants just the feet, so maybe I should just say 4,983 feet.\n\nWait, but that ignores the additional 4 inches. So, maybe it's better to convert the entire height into feet, including the fraction.\n\nSo, total height is 59,800 inches.\n\nSince 1 foot = 12 inches, then height in feet is 59,800 / 12 = 4,983.333... feet\n\nSo, approximately 4,983.33 feet.\n\nAlternatively, I could express it in feet and inches, like 4,983 feet and 4 inches.\n\nBut perhaps the question prefers just feet, so maybe I should go with 4,983.33 feet.\n\nLet me check the question again. It says \"how tall would the stack be in feet.\" So, probably, just in feet is fine, but including the inches might be more accurate.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider scientific notation or something, but that seems unnecessary for this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how tall that is in more familiar terms. For example, compared to buildings or skyscrapers.\n\nBut perhaps that's beyond the scope of the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to simplify the calculation.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nIf one penny is 0.0598 inches thick, then 1,000,000 pennies would be 1,000,000 * 0.0598 inches.\n\nLet me calculate that again.\n\n1,000,000 * 0.0598 = 59,800 inches.\n\nNow, to convert inches to feet, since 1 foot = 12 inches, then height in feet = 59,800 / 12.\n\nLet me do that division step by step.\n\n12 times 4,983 is 59,796, as I had before.\n\n59,800 - 59,796 = 4 inches.\n\nSo, 4,983 feet and 4 inches.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal feet, that's 4,983.333... feet.\n\nSo, approximately 4,983.33 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I could say 4,983 and one-third feet.\n\nBut in decimal form, it's 4,983.333... feet.\n\nSo, I think 4,983.33 feet is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can round it to two decimal places, making it 4,983.33 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if the context allows, maybe rounding to the nearest foot would be sufficient, which would be 4,983 feet.\n\nBut, to be honest, since the thickness of a penny is given to four decimal places, perhaps maintaining more precision is advisable.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, expressing it as 4,983 feet and 4 inches might be the most precise and understandable way.\n\nAlternatively, if only feet are required, then 4,983.33 feet is fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can provide the answer in both ways.\n\nSo, the stack would be approximately 4,983 feet and 4 inches tall, or about 4,983.33 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me verify the thickness of a penny. According to my knowledge, a US penny is about 0.0598 inches thick.\n\nSo, 1,000,000 pennies would be 1,000,000 * 0.0598 inches = 59,800 inches.\n\nNow, converting to feet: 59,800 inches / 12 inches per foot = 4,983.333... feet.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about it in terms of exponents.\n\n1,000,000 is 10^6, and 0.0598 is approximately 6 * 10^-2.\n\nSo, 10^6 * 6 * 10^-2 = 6 * 10^4 inches.\n\nBut 6 * 10^4 is 60,000 inches.\n\nWait, but 0.0598 is closer to 6 * 10^-2, but 6 * 10^-2 times 10^6 is 6 * 10^4, which is 60,000 inches.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated it as 59,800 inches.\n\nSo, there's a slight discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that 0.0598 is approximately 6 * 10^-2, but for more precision, it's 5.98 * 10^-2.\n\nSo, 10^6 * 5.98 * 10^-2 = 5.98 * 10^4 inches, which is 59,800 inches.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, total height is 59,800 inches.\n\nNow, to convert to feet, 59,800 / 12.\n\nLet me calculate that again.\n\n12 * 4,983 = 59,796\n\n59,800 - 59,796 = 4 inches\n\nSo, 4,983 feet and 4 inches.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal feet, that's 4,983 and 4/12 feet, which is 4,983.333... feet.\n\nSo, approximately 4,983.33 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express it in scientific notation: 4.9833 * 10^3 feet.\n\nBut that might be unnecessary for this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider how tall that is in miles, for context.\n\nThere are 5,280 feet in a mile.\n\nSo, 4,983 feet divided by 5,280 is approximately 0.94 miles.\n\nSo, it's almost a mile high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps comparing it to well-known structures could provide context.\n\nFor example, the Empire State Building is about 1,454 feet tall, including its antenna.\n\nSo, 4,983 feet is roughly three and a half times taller than the Empire State Building.\n\nAlternatively, the Burj Khalifa is about 2,722 feet tall.\n\nSo, 4,983 feet is about 1.83 times the height of the Burj Khalifa.\n\nBut perhaps that's beyond the scope of the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider how long it would take to climb that stack, assuming average stair climbing speed, but that seems irrelevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the weight of the stack, but again, that might not be relevant to the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the value of one million pennies, but that's also beyond the scope.\n\nSo, to conclude, the stack would be approximately 4,983 feet and 4 inches tall, or about 4,983.33 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if only a numerical answer is required, perhaps I can box the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the stack would be approximately 4,983.33 feet tall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4983.33 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
