        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a store that sells 80% of its inventory each month. We want to know what percentage of the original inventory is left after two months, assuming no new items are added.\n\nFirst, let's understand what happens in the first month. If the store sells 80% of its inventory, that means it's left with 20% of its original stock. Right? Because 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nNow, in the second month, the store again sells 80% of its current inventory. But this time, the \"current inventory\" is already reduced to 20% of the original. So, we need to calculate 80% of this remaining 20%.\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nFirst month remaining: 100% - 80% = 20%\n\nSecond month sale: 80% of the remaining 20%\n\nSo, 80% of 20% is (80/100) * 20% = 0.8 * 20% = 16%\n\nTherefore, in the second month, the store sells another 16% of the original inventory.\n\nNow, to find out what's left after two months, we need to subtract the total sold from the original.\n\nTotal sold after two months: first month's 80% plus second month's 16% = 80% + 16% = 96%\n\nSo, the remaining inventory is 100% - 96% = 4%\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it like this:\n\nAfter the first month, 20% remains.\n\nIn the second month, it sells 80% of this remaining 20%, which is 16% of the original inventory, leaving 4% of the original inventory.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, after two months, 4% of the original inventory remains.\n\nBut let me consider another approach to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nSuppose the original inventory is 100 units.\n\nFirst month: sells 80 units, remains with 20 units.\n\nSecond month: sells 80% of the remaining 20 units, which is 16 units.\n\nSo, after two months, it has 20 - 16 = 4 units left.\n\nTherefore, 4% of the original inventory remains.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of multiplication.\n\nAfter the first month, inventory is 100% - 80% = 20% of original.\n\nAfter the second month, it's 20% * 20% = 4% of original.\n\nWait, but 20% of 20% is indeed 4%.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that each month, the remaining inventory is 20% of the previous month's inventory.\n\nSo, after one month: 100% * 20% = 20%\n\nAfter two months: 20% * 20% = 4%\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI think 4% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4\\%} \\]"
