        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a shirt costs $25 and it's on sale for 20% off. I need to find out what the final price will be after applying the discount. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. Percentages can be a bit tricky, but I think I've got it. So, 20% off means I'm saving 20% of the original price. The original price is $25. So, I need to calculate what 20% of $25 is.\n\nTo find a percentage of a number, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} \\times \\text{original price} = \\text{discount amount}\n\\]\n\nBut I need to make sure that the percentage is in decimal form. I know that 20% is the same as 20/100, which is 0.20. So, I can rewrite the formula as:\n\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 25 = \\text{discount amount}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 25 = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the discount amount is $5.\n\nNext, I need to subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{original price} - \\text{discount amount} = \\text{final price}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n25 - 5 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final price of the shirt after applying the 20% discount is $20.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of calculating the discount and then subtracting it, I could calculate what percentage of the original price I actually have to pay.\n\nIf the shirt is 20% off, that means I'm paying 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price. So, another way to find the final price is to calculate 80% of $25.\n\nLet's try that to double-check my answer.\n\nFirst, convert 80% to a decimal. 80% is 80/100, which is 0.80.\n\nThen, multiply the original price by this decimal:\n\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 25 = 20\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get $20 as the final price. That's reassuring. Both methods give me the same answer, so I can be confident that $20 is correct.\n\nJust to make sure I understand this fully, let's consider another example. Suppose something costs $100 and is on sale for 25% off. What would be the final price?\n\nFirst method: calculate the discount amount.\n\n25% of $100 is 0.25 \u00d7 100 = $25.\n\nThen, subtract the discount from the original price: 100 - 25 = $75.\n\nSecond method: calculate what percentage you're paying.\n\n100% - 25% = 75%.\n\nThen, 75% of $100 is 0.75 \u00d7 100 = $75.\n\nAgain, both methods give the same answer.\n\nSo, applying this back to the original problem, the final price of the shirt after a 20% discount is $20.\n\nI think that makes sense. Maybe I can also think about it in terms of fractions. 20% is equivalent to 1/5. So, a 20% discount means I'm saving 1/5 of the original price.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1/5 of $25 is $5, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, subtracting $5 from $25 again gives me $20.\n\nAll these different approaches lead to the same conclusion, which gives me confidence in the answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Perhaps using proportions or something else?\n\nWell, proportions might be overkill for this simple percentage problem, but I could set it up as a proportion to see.\n\nIf 100% corresponds to $25, then 20% corresponds to what amount?\n\nLet me set up the proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{100} = \\frac{x}{25}\n\\]\n\nThen, solve for x:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{20 \\times 25}{100} = \\frac{500}{100} = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the discount is $5, and subtracting that from $25 gives $20 again.\n\nAlright, I've confirmed it multiple ways now. I'm satisfied with the answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the price was not a whole number. Say the shirt costs $24.75 and is on sale for 20% off. How would I calculate that?\n\nFirst method: calculate the discount amount.\n\n20% of $24.75 is 0.20 \u00d7 24.75 = $4.95.\n\nThen, subtract the discount: 24.75 - 4.95 = $19.80.\n\nSecond method: calculate 80% of $24.75.\n\n0.80 \u00d7 24.75 = $19.80.\n\nAgain, both methods give the same answer.\n\nSo, the process is the same regardless of whether the original price is a whole number or a decimal.\n\nIn conclusion, for the original problem, the final price of the shirt after a 20% discount is $20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
