        "content": "So I've got this problem here: someone invests $5000 in a savings account that has an annual interest rate of 3%, and the interest is compounded monthly. I need to figure out how much money will be in the account after 5 years. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for compound interest because that's what's being used here. The general formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money. In this case, it's $5000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal). Here, it's 3%, so I need to convert that percentage to a decimal. 3% is equal to 0.03.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since the interest is compounded monthly, n would be 12, as there are 12 months in a year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years. In this problem, it's 5 years.\n\nSo, plugging these values into the formula:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.03/12)^(12*5)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the monthly interest rate:\n\n0.03 / 12 = 0.0025\n\nThen, add 1 to that:\n\n1 + 0.0025 = 1.0025\n\nNow, raise that to the power of 12 times 5, which is 60:\n\n1.0025^60\n\nI'll need to calculate 1.0025 raised to the 60th power. Let me grab a calculator for that.\n\n[Calculating 1.0025^60]\n\nOkay, 1.0025 to the 60th power is approximately 1.161616.\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal amount:\n\n5000 * 1.161616 = 5808.08\n\nSo, after 5 years, the account should have approximately $5808.08.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the monthly interest rate is indeed 0.03 divided by 12, which is 0.0025.\n\nThen, 1 plus 0.0025 is 1.0025.\n\nRaising 1.0025 to the 60th power should give me about 1.161616.\n\nMultiplying that by 5000 gives 5808.08.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the compound interest formula in a different way to verify.\n\nSome people might use the formula:\n\nA = P * e^(rt)\n\nBut wait, that's for continuous compounding, which isn't the case here. The interest is compounded monthly, so the first formula I used is the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the monthly interest and apply it each month for 5 years, but that would be time-consuming and shouldn't be necessary since the formula already accounts for that.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any possibility of additional deposits or withdrawals? The problem doesn't mention any, so I assume it's just the initial deposit of $5000 left to accrue interest over 5 years.\n\nAlso, the interest rate is given as an annual rate of 3%, compounded monthly. Sometimes, interest rates can be nominal or effective, but in standard compound interest problems, the given rate is the nominal annual rate unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, after 5 years, the account will have approximately $5808.08.\n\nWait, perhaps I should round it to two decimal places since it's money.\n\nSo, $5808.08 is already in two decimal places, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, depending on the context, sometimes money is rounded to the nearest cent, but in this case, it's already precise.\n\nSo, my final answer is $5808.08.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5808.08} \\]"
