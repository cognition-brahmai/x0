        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Java program that downloads multiple files concurrently using multithreading, we can leverage the `ExecutorService` framework provided by Java's concurrency utilities.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Import necessary libraries:**\n   - `java.io.*` for file operations.\n   - `java.net.*` for URL handling and downloading.\n   - `java.util.concurrent.*` for managing threads.\n\n2. **Create a downloader task:**\n   - Implement a `Runnable` or use a lambda expression to define the task of downloading a single file from a given URL.\n\n3. **Set up an ExecutorService:**\n   - Use `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()` to create a thread pool with a fixed number of threads.\n\n4. **Submit tasks to the ExecutorService:**\n   - For each URL provided as a command-line argument, submit a download task to the ExecutorService.\n\n5. **Shutdown the ExecutorService:**\n   - After submitting all tasks, shut down the ExecutorService to release resources.\n\nHere's a sample code that demonstrates this:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedInputStream;\nimport java.io.FileOutputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.net.URL;\nimport java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\n\npublic class MultiThreadedDownloader {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length == 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Please provide URLs as command-line arguments.\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Create a fixed thread pool with 5 threads\n        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);\n\n        for (String url : args) {\n            // Submit each download task to the executor\n            executor.submit(() -> downloadFile(url));\n        }\n\n        // Shutdown the executor after all tasks are submitted\n        executor.shutdown();\n    }\n\n    private static void downloadFile(String url) {\n        try (BufferedInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new URL(url).openStream());\n             FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(getFileName(url))) {\n\n            byte[] dataBuffer = new byte[1024];\n            int bytesRead;\n            while ((bytesRead = in.read(dataBuffer, 0, 1024)) != -1) {\n                fileOutputStream.write(dataBuffer, 0, bytesRead);\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"Download complete for: \" + url);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error downloading file from: \" + url + \", \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static String getFileName(String url) {\n        // Extract the file name from the URL path\n        String fileName = url.substring(url.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);\n        return fileName;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Command-line arguments:**\n   - The URLs to download are passed as command-line arguments.\n\n2. **ExecutorService:**\n   - A fixed thread pool with 5 threads is created using `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5)`. You can adjust the number of threads based on your requirements.\n\n3. **Download task:**\n   - Each download task is a lambda expression that calls the `downloadFile` method, which handles the actual download process.\n   - The `downloadFile` method uses `BufferedInputStream` to read from the URL and `FileOutputStream` to write to a local file.\n\n4. **File naming:**\n   - The `getFileName` method extracts the file name from the URL path.\n\n5. **Shutdown:**\n   - The ExecutorService is shut down after all download tasks are submitted.\n\nThis program will download multiple files concurrently, leveraging multithreading to improve efficiency."
