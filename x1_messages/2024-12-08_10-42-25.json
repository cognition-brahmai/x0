        "content": "Yes, both Istanbul and Dubai attract more international tourists than Miami. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), in 2019, Istanbul was the world's fifth most-visited city, with over 15 million international tourists, while Dubai was the seventh, with over 15 million international tourists as well. On the other hand, Miami was ranked 44th, with around 3.4 million international tourists. It's worth noting that these numbers may have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but generally, Istanbul and Dubai are more popular tourist destinations than Miami."
