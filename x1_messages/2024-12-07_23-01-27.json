        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a group of 50 people: 30 with brown eyes and the remaining 20 with blue eyes. We need to find the probability that, when selecting 5 people at random from this group, exactly 3 of them have brown eyes.\n\nFirst off, it's important to note that this is a problem involving combinations because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter. We're dealing with groups or sets here, not sequences.\n\nThe total number of ways to select 5 people out of 50 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 5 people out of 50 is:\n\n\\[\nC(50, 5) = \\frac{50!}{5!(50 - 5)!} = \\frac{50!}{5! \\times 45!}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose exactly 3 people with brown eyes and 2 with blue eyes.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to choose 3 people with brown eyes out of 30:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 3) = \\frac{30!}{3!(30 - 3)!} = \\frac{30!}{3! \\times 27!}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 people with blue eyes out of 20 is:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20 - 2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times 18!}\n\\]\n\nThe total number of favorable outcomes, which is selecting exactly 3 brown-eyed and 2 blue-eyed people, is the product of these two combinations:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 3) \\times C(20, 2)\n\\]\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 3 brown-eyed}) = \\frac{C(30, 3) \\times C(20, 2)}{C(50, 5)}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute these values step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( C(30, 3) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(30, 3) = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{24,360}{6} = 4,060\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( C(20, 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{380}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( C(50, 5) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(50, 5) = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{254,251,200}{120} = 2,118,760\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply the combinations for the favorable outcomes:\n\n\\[\n4,060 \\times 190 = 771,400\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide the favorable outcomes by the total possible outcomes to get the probability:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{771,400}{2,118,760} \\approx 0.364\n\\]\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n0.364 \\times 100 = 36.4\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of selecting exactly 3 people with brown eyes out of 5 randomly chosen people from this group is approximately 36.4%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.364} \\]"
