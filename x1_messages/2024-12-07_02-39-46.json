        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, there's a store having a sale where everything is discounted by 20%. The customer wants to buy something that normally costs $100. First, I need to figure out what the sale price of that item is.\n\nSince there's a 20% discount, that means the customer pays 80% of the original price. So, I can calculate the sale price by multiplying $100 by 80%. Let's do that:\n\n$100 \u00d7 0.80 = $80\n\nSo, the item costs $80 after the discount.\n\nNow, the customer is paying with a gift card that has $50 left on it. So, they're going to use the gift card to cover part of the $80 cost. To find out how much more they need to pay, I subtract the gift card balance from the sale price:\n\n$80 - $50 = $30\n\nTherefore, the customer needs to pay an additional $30 in cash to complete the purchase.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Sometimes, stores have rules about how gift cards can be used, but since the question doesn't specify any restrictions, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if the gift card can only be used for full amounts or something like that, but again, the question doesn't mention any such constraints. So, I stick with the $30 cash needed.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Suppose the gift card is applied before the discount is applied. Would that change anything?\n\nActually, no. Discounts are usually applied to the original price, and then payments are made against the discounted price. So, the discount reduces the total amount owed, and then the gift card is applied to that reduced amount.\n\nIn this case, the discounted price is $80, and the gift card covers $50 of that, leaving $30 to be paid in cash.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Unless there's some trick I'm missing, the answer should be $30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
