Greece is a European country located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, with a long history and rich culture. The isthmus has been an important transportation route and strategic location throughout history, and today, the Corinth Canal traverses it, providing a shorter route for ships between the western and eastern Mediterranean Seas."
