        "content": "So I've got this bacteria population that doubles every 3 hours, and I need to figure out how long it'll take for the population to become ten times larger. Hmm, exponential growth, right? I remember that exponential growth can be modeled with a formula like \\(N(t) = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)}\\), where:\n\n- \\(N(t)\\) is the population at time \\(t\\),\n\n- \\(N_0\\) is the initial population,\n\n- \\(T\\) is the doubling time.\n\nIn this case, the doubling time \\(T\\) is 3 hours. So, the formula becomes \\(N(t) = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/3)}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the time \\(t\\) when the population is ten times the initial population, meaning \\(N(t) = 10 \\times N_0\\).\n\nSo, setting up the equation:\n\n\\[10 \\times N_0 = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/3)}\\]\n\nI can divide both sides by \\(N_0\\) (assuming \\(N_0\\) isn't zero, which it shouldn't be for a population):\n\n\\[10 = 2^{(t/3)}\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(t\\). This seems like a logarithm problem. I can take the logarithm of both sides to solve for \\(t\\). Let's use natural logarithms for this.\n\nTaking the natural log of both sides:\n\n\\[\\ln(10) = \\ln(2^{(t/3)})\\]\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, \\(\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)\\), so:\n\n\\[\\ln(10) = \\frac{t}{3} \\ln(2)\\]\n\nNow, solving for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[t = 3 \\times \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)}\\]\n\nLet me calculate that. First, \\(\\ln(10)\\) is approximately 2.302585, and \\(\\ln(2)\\) is approximately 0.693147.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = 3 \\times \\frac{2.302585}{0.693147} \\approx 3 \\times 3.321928 \\approx 9.965784\\]\n\nSo, it's approximately 9.97 hours. But let's check if there's a more precise way or if I made any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for exponential growth with base 10. Since the population increases tenfold, maybe I can set it up differently.\n\nLet me think again. The population doubles every 3 hours, so after 3 hours, it's \\(2N_0\\), after 6 hours, it's \\(4N_0\\), after 9 hours, it's \\(8N_0\\), and after 12 hours, it's \\(16N_0\\). Hmm, 8 is less than 10, and 16 is more than 10, so the time should be between 9 and 12 hours, which matches my earlier calculation of approximately 9.97 hours.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using the rule of 70 or something similar for exponential growth?\n\nWait, the rule of 70 is for estimating doubling time in growth rates, but here we already have the doubling time. Maybe I can use the continuous growth formula.\n\nThe continuous growth formula is \\(N(t) = N_0 e^{rt}\\), where \\(r\\) is the growth rate.\n\nGiven that the population doubles every 3 hours, I can find \\(r\\) first.\n\nSo, \\(2N_0 = N_0 e^{3r}\\)\n\nDividing both sides by \\(N_0\\):\n\n\\[2 = e^{3r}\\]\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\n\\[\\ln(2) = 3r\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[r = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3}\\]\\)\n\nNow, using the continuous growth formula to find when \\(N(t) = 10N_0\\):\n\n\\[10N_0 = N_0 e^{rt}\\]\n\n\\[10 = e^{rt}\\]\n\n\\[10 = e^{(\\ln(2)/3)t}\\]\n\nTaking natural logs again:\n\n\\[\\ln(10) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3} t\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = \\frac{3 \\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)}\\]\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, it confirms that the time is approximately 9.97 hours.\n\nBut maybe I can express it in hours and minutes. 0.97 hours is approximately 0.97 \u00d7 60 minutes, which is about 58 minutes. So, roughly 9 hours and 58 minutes.\n\nLet me check if there's a more exact way to express this. Using a calculator for more decimal places:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx 3.321928094887362\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = 3 \\times 3.321928094887362 \\approx 9.965784284662087\\]\n\nConverting 0.965784284662087 hours to minutes:\n\n\\[0.965784284662087 \\times 60 \\approx 57.94705707972522\\]\n\nSo, approximately 57.95 minutes, which is about 58 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the population will increase tenfold in approximately 9 hours and 58 minutes.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem to ensure the accuracy of the result? Maybe by calculating the population at different time intervals.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- At t=9 hours:\n\nThe population doubles every 3 hours, so:\n\n- At t=0: \\(N_0\\)\n\n- At t=3 hours: \\(2N_0\\)\n\n- At t=6 hours: \\(4N_0\\)\n\n- At t=9 hours: \\(8N_0\\)\n\nSo, at 9 hours, the population is 8 times the initial population, which is less than tenfold.\n\n- At t=12 hours:\n\n- At t=9 hours: \\(8N_0\\)\n\n- At t=12 hours: \\(16N_0\\)\n\nWhich is more than tenfold.\n\nSo, indeed, the time should be between 9 and 12 hours, specifically around 9.97 hours, which aligns with my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms with a different base to verify.\n\nLet's try using base-2 logarithms.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[10 = 2^{(t/3)}\\]\n\nTaking log base 2 of both sides:\n\n\\[\\log_2(10) = \\frac{t}{3}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = 3 \\times \\log_2(10)\\]\n\nI know that \\(\\log_2(10)\\) is the same as \\(\\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)}\\), which is consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I have a calculator that can compute \\(\\log_2(10)\\), I can directly compute:\n\n\\[\\log_2(10) \\approx 3.321928\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[t = 3 \\times 3.321928 \\approx 9.965784\\]\n\nSame result as before.\n\nSo, I think this is correct. The population will increase tenfold in approximately 9.97 hours, or 9 hours and 58 minutes.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider the generation time or something related to bacterial growth phases, but since the problem states that the population doubles every 3 hours, and doesn't mention any limitations like resource constraints or carrying capacity, I can assume unlimited growth for this scenario.\n\nIn real-world scenarios, bacterial growth is often modeled with a logistic growth curve, where growth slows down as resources become limited or waste products accumulate. However, given the problem's simplicity, I think the exponential growth model is sufficient here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the growth rate per hour and then integrate it over time, but that would essentially lead back to the same exponential growth formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 70, which is a way to estimate doubling time for investments, but in this case, since I already know the doubling time, it's not necessary.\n\nWait, the rule of 70 is for estimating doubling time when you have a growth rate in percentage. For example, if you have a growth rate of 7% per year, the doubling time is approximately 70 / 7 = 10 years. But here, we have the doubling time already, so it's not directly applicable.\n\nMaybe I can calculate the continuous growth rate and use that.\n\nI already did that earlier when I used the formula \\(N(t) = N_0 e^{rt}\\) and found \\(r = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3}\\) per hour.\n\nThen, to find when \\(N(t) = 10N_0\\):\n\n\\[10N_0 = N_0 e^{rt}\\]\n\n\\[10 = e^{rt}\\]\n\n\\[t = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{r} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)/3} = 3 \\times \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)}\\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now. The answer should be approximately 9.97 hours.\n\nJust to be complete, perhaps I can also consider using common fractions or logarithm tables, but in this digital age, calculators are readily available, so it's more practical to use them for precision.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't have a calculator, I could approximate the values.\n\nI know that \\(\\ln(10)\\) is approximately 2.3026 and \\(\\ln(2)\\) is approximately 0.6931.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{2.3026}{0.6931} \\approx 3.32\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[t = 3 \\times 3.32 = 9.96\\]\n\nWhich is close enough to 9.97 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is approximately \\(10^3\\), so \\(2^{10} \\approx 10^3\\), which gives \\(2 \\approx 10^{3/10} = 10^{0.3}\\), so \\(\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.3\\), and \\(\\ln(2) = \\log_{10}(2)/\\log_{10}(e) \\approx 0.3 / 0.4343 \\approx 0.69\\), which matches the known value.\n\nBut again, this is more of a manual calculation approach, and with a calculator, it's easier to get a precise value.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the bacteria population will increase tenfold in approximately 9.97 hours, or roughly 10 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9.97 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
