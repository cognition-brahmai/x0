        "content": "So I have this problem: \"How many ways can you arrange the letters in the word 'TENNESSEE'?\" Okay, so I need to find out how many different ways to arrange these letters. I remember that when all the letters are distinct, the number of arrangements is just the factorial of the number of letters. But in this case, some letters are repeated, so I have to account for that.\n\nFirst, let's count how many letters there are in total. \"TENNESSEE\" has 9 letters. So, if all letters were unique, the number of arrangements would be 9 factorial, which is 9!. But since some letters are the same, I need to divide by the factorial of the number of times each letter repeats.\n\nLet's see how many times each letter appears:\n\n- T: 1 time\n\n- E: 4 times\n\n- N: 2 times\n\n- S: 2 times\n\nSo, the formula for the number of distinct arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{9!}{1! \\times 4! \\times 2! \\times 2!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate this. First, calculate 9!:\n\n\\[\n9! = 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 362880\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the factorials of the repetitions:\n\n\\[\n1! = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply these together:\n\n\\[\n1! \\times 4! \\times 2! \\times 2! = 1 \\times 24 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 96\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide 9! by this product:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{362880}{96} = 3780\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 3780 distinct ways to arrange the letters in \"TENNESSEE.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to think about it. Another approach is to consider the positions for each letter.\n\nFirst, choose positions for the E's. There are 4 E's in 9 positions. The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 9 for E's is \\(\\binom{9}{4}\\).\n\nThen, choose positions for the N's from the remaining 5 positions. There are 2 N's, so that's \\(\\binom{5}{2}\\).\n\nNext, choose positions for the S's from the remaining 3 positions. There are 2 S's, so that's \\(\\binom{3}{2}\\).\n\nFinally, the last position will be for the T.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements would be:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{4} \\times \\binom{5}{2} \\times \\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{1}{1}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate each binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{4} = \\frac{9!}{4!(9-4)!} = \\frac{9!}{4!5!} = \\frac{362880}{24 \\times 120} = \\frac{362880}{2880} = 126\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{6}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{1}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply them together:\n\n\\[\n126 \\times 10 = 1260\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1260 \\times 3 = 3780\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3780 \\times 1 = 3780\n\\]\n\nSo, again, I get 3780. That matches my first calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of permutations of multiset. The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a multiset is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times \\cdots \\times n_k!}\n\\]\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the frequencies of the distinct items.\n\nIn this case, n = 9, n1 = 1 (for T), n2 = 4 (for E), n3 = 2 (for N), n4 = 2 (for S). Plugging into the formula gives the same expression as before:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9!}{1! \\times 4! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = 3780\n\\]\n\nSo, all these methods confirm that there are 3780 distinct arrangements.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any overcounting or undercounting in this approach. Since the letters are being arranged in distinct positions and the repetitions are accounted for by dividing by the factorials of their frequencies, I don't think there's any overcounting.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider all letters distinct and then adjust for the repetitions. If all 9 letters were distinct, there would be 9! = 362880 arrangements. But since there are repetitions, we need to divide by the number of ways the repeated letters can be arranged among themselves, which is 4! for E's, 2! for N's, and 2! for S's.\n\nSo, again, the formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9!}{4! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = 3780\n\\]\n\nWait, in this case, T appears only once, so its factorial is 1, which is why it's not included in the denominator. But it's still correct.\n\nI think this is solid. There shouldn't be any other factors to consider. So, the final answer is 3780 distinct arrangements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3780} \\]"
