        "content": "So the train normally travels at 60 km/h and takes 10 minutes between stations. If the speed increases by 50%, what would be the new time taken?\n\nFirst, I need to find out what 50% of 60 km/h is. 50% of 60 is 30, so the new speed would be 60 + 30 = 90 km/h.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it takes to travel the same distance at 90 km/h.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the distance between the stations. I only know the time it takes at 60 km/h, which is 10 minutes.\n\nMaybe I can find the distance first.\n\nDistance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, distance = 60 km/h * 10 minutes.\n\nHmm, but time is in minutes and speed is in km/h, so I need to make sure the units match.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 10 minutes is 10/60 hours, which is 1/6 hour.\n\nSo, distance = 60 km/h * 1/6 hour = 10 km.\n\nOkay, so the distance between the stations is 10 km.\n\nNow, at the new speed of 90 km/h, time = distance / speed = 10 km / 90 km/h.\n\nThat would be 10/90 hours, which simplifies to 1/9 hour.\n\nTo convert that back to minutes, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1/9 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60/9 minutes = 6.666... minutes.\n\nSo, it would take approximately 6 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nWait, how did you get 6 minutes and 40 seconds from 6.666 minutes?\n\nWell, 0.666 minutes is equal to 0.666 * 60 seconds, which is approximately 40 seconds.\n\nSo, the new time would be about 6 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nBut maybe there's a more precise way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, since time is inversely proportional to speed when distance is constant, the new time should be the original time multiplied by the ratio of the original speed to the new speed.\n\nWait, no. If time is inversely proportional to speed, then time_new = time_original * (speed_original / speed_new).\n\nSo, time_new = 10 minutes * (60 km/h / 90 km/h) = 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 minutes \u2248 6.666 minutes, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, approximately 6 minutes 40 seconds.\n\nBut to be more precise, 0.666 minutes is exactly 40 seconds, because 0.666 * 60 = 40 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the new time would be 6 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nBut maybe the question expects the answer in minutes, with decimal places.\n\nIn that case, 6.666... minutes can be expressed as 6.667 minutes, rounding to three decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, it could be expressed as 6 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nI think both are acceptable, depending on the context.\n\nSo, if the train's speed is increased by 50% to 90 km/h, it would take approximately 6 minutes and 40 seconds to travel the same 10 km distance between stations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ minutes and } 40 \\text{ seconds}} \\]"
