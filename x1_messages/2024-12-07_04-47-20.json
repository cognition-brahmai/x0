        "content": "So, we have a water tank that can hold 12,000 liters, and it takes 5 minutes to fill up 25% of it using a hose. We need to find out how long it will take to fill the entire tank. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what 25% of the tank's capacity is. Since the tank holds 12,000 liters, 25% of that would be:\n\n25% of 12,000 liters = 0.25 \u00d7 12,000 = 3,000 liters\n\nSo, in 5 minutes, the hose fills up 3,000 liters.\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it will take to fill the entire tank, which is 12,000 liters.\n\nOne way to approach this is to determine the filling rate of the hose and then use that rate to calculate the total time needed for 12,000 liters.\n\nFirst, let's find the filling rate in liters per minute.\n\nFilling rate = amount filled / time taken\n\n= 3,000 liters / 5 minutes\n\n= 600 liters per minute\n\nNow, to find the total time to fill 12,000 liters at this rate:\n\nTotal time = total volume / filling rate\n\n= 12,000 liters / 600 liters per minute\n\n= 20 minutes\n\nSo, it will take 20 minutes to fill the entire tank.\n\nAlternatively, since 25% takes 5 minutes, we can find out how long 100% will take by setting up a proportion.\n\nIf 25% takes 5 minutes, then 100% will take x minutes.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n25% / 5 minutes = 100% / x minutes\n\nOr, 0.25 / 5 = 1 / x\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n0.25 / 5 = 1 / x\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\n(0.25 / 5) * x = 1\n\nNow, divide both sides by (0.25 / 5):\n\nx = 1 / (0.25 / 5)\n\nx = 1 / 0.05\n\nx = 20 minutes\n\nAgain, we get 20 minutes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that since 25% takes 5 minutes, to get to 100%, which is four times 25%, it would take four times 5 minutes:\n\n4 \u00d7 5 minutes = 20 minutes\n\nThis confirms our previous calculations.\n\nTherefore, it will take 20 minutes to fill the entire tank.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
