        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to install solar-powered streetlights along a 10-mile stretch of road. Each streetlight needs a solar panel that's 250 watts, and there's a rebate program that covers 30% of the cost of these panels, which cost $1 per watt on average.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many streetlights are needed for that 10-mile stretch. The spacing requirement is one streetlight every 200 feet. But since the distance is given in miles, I should convert that to feet to make it consistent.\n\nI know that 1 mile equals 5,280 feet. So, 10 miles would be:\n\n10 miles * 5,280 feet/mile = 52,800 feet\n\nNow, if streetlights are placed every 200 feet, the number of streetlights needed would be:\n\n52,800 feet / 200 feet/streetlight = 264 streetlights\n\nWait a minute, but actually, when you think about it, if you have a stretch of road and you place a streetlight every 200 feet, the number of intervals between streetlights would be 52,800 / 200 = 264. However, the number of streetlights would be one more than the number of intervals because you need a streetlight at both ends. So, it should be 264 + 1 = 265 streetlights.\n\nBut, maybe in practice, they might not need one at both ends or perhaps the spacing is inclusive of both ends. To keep it simple, I'll stick with 264 streetlights.\n\nNext, each streetlight requires a 250-watt solar panel, and they cost $1 per watt. So, the cost per panel is:\n\n250 watts * $1/watt = $250 per panel\n\nWithout the rebate, the total cost for all panels would be:\n\n264 panels * $250/panel = $66,000\n\nNow, there's a rebate program that covers 30% of the cost. So, the rebate amount would be:\n\n30% of $66,000 = 0.30 * $66,000 = $19,800\n\nTherefore, the total cost after the rebate would be:\n\n$66,000 - $19,800 = $46,200\n\nSo, the total cost of the solar panels for this project, after factoring in the rebate, is $46,200, and the number of streetlights that can be installed is 264.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 265 streetlights. Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nIf the road is 52,800 feet long and streetlights are placed every 200 feet, starting from the beginning, then the positions would be at 0 feet, 200 feet, 400 feet, and so on, up to 52,800 feet.\n\nSo, the number of streetlights would indeed be 52,800 / 200 + 1 = 264 + 1 = 265 streetlights.\n\nHmm, but in practice, perhaps the spacing is such that the last streetlight is at the end, and the first one is at the start, so maybe it is 265.\n\nBut in the initial calculation, I used 264 streetlights. To be accurate, I should use 265.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nNumber of streetlights = 265\n\nTotal cost without rebate = 265 * $250 = $66,250\n\nRebate = 30% of $66,250 = $19,875\n\nTotal cost after rebate = $66,250 - $19,875 = $46,375\n\nSo, the more accurate total cost is $46,375 for 265 streetlights.\n\nBut perhaps the city is only planning to install streetlights along one side of the road. Maybe it's a two-lane road, and they want to install streetlights on both sides. If that's the case, the number would double.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's one side only.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any other costs involved, like installation, maintenance, etc., but the problem specifically asks for the cost of solar panels, so I'll focus on that.\n\nAdditionally, the rebate program covers 30% of the cost of the solar panels, which is straightforward.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total cost for the solar panels, after the rebate, is $46,375, and the number of streetlights that can be installed is 265, based on a spacing of one every 200 feet along a 10-mile stretch of road.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{265 \\text{ streetlights, } \\$46,375 \\text{ total cost}} \\]"
