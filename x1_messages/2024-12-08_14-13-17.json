        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 units of product A every day, but on weekends, production is reduced by 50%. Today is Monday, and we need to find out how many units will be produced in the next 10 days.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of these 10 days are weekdays and which are weekends. Since today is Monday, the next 10 days will be:\n\n- Day 1: Monday (weekday)\n\n- Day 2: Tuesday (weekday)\n\n- Day 3: Wednesday (weekday)\n\n- Day 4: Thursday (weekday)\n\n- Day 5: Friday (weekday)\n\n- Day 6: Saturday (weekend)\n\n- Day 7: Sunday (weekend)\n\n- Day 8: Monday (weekday)\n\n- Day 9: Tuesday (weekday)\n\n- Day 10: Wednesday (weekday)\n\nSo, out of these 10 days, there are 7 weekdays and 3 weekends.\n\nNow, on weekdays, the factory produces 200 units per day. On weekends, production is reduced by 50%, which means it produces 50% of 200 units.\n\nLet me calculate the weekend production:\n\n50% of 200 units = 0.5 * 200 = 100 units per day on weekends.\n\nNow, I can calculate the total production for weekdays and weekends separately and then add them up.\n\nTotal production on weekdays:\n\n7 days * 200 units/day = 1400 units\n\nTotal production on weekends:\n\n3 days * 100 units/day = 300 units\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n1400 units + 300 units = 1700 units\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check the days. Starting from Monday, the next 10 days are:\n\n1. Monday (weekday)\n\n2. Tuesday (weekday)\n\n3. Wednesday (weekday)\n\n4. Thursday (weekday)\n\n5. Friday (weekday)\n\n6. Saturday (weekend)\n\n7. Sunday (weekend)\n\n8. Monday (weekday)\n\n9. Tuesday (weekday)\n\n10. Wednesday (weekday)\n\nYes, that's 7 weekdays and 3 weekends.\n\nSo, the total production in the next 10 days will be 1700 units.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any holiday or something, but the question doesn't mention any exceptions besides the weekend reduction.\n\nAlso,\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\u751f\u4ea7\u51cf\u5c1150%\u662f\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e73\u65f6\u7684200\u5355\u4f4d\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5468\u672b\u662f100\u5355\u4f4d\u6bcf\u5929\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c7\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e5*200\u5355\u4f4d+3\u4e2a\u5468\u672b\u65e5*100\u5355\u4f4d=1400+300=1700\u5355\u4f4d\u3002\n\n\u597d\u50cf\u6ca1\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u4e86\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1700} \\]"
