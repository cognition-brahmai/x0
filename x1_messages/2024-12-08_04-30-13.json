Let's implement a simple stack in C++ that includes push, pop, and peek operations, along with error handling for underflow and overflow conditions.\n\nFirst, we need to decide on the size of the stack. For simplicity, let's assume a fixed size stack. We'll use an array to store the elements.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a class called `Stack`.\n2. Use an array to store the stack elements.\n3. Keep track of the top of the stack using an integer variable.\n4. Implement the following methods:\n   - `push`: Adds an element to the top of the stack. If the stack is full, handle the overflow.\n   - `pop`: Removes the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, handle the underflow.\n   - `peek`: Returns the top element without removing it. If the stack is empty, handle the underflow.\n   - `isFull`: Checks if the stack is full.\n   - `isEmpty`: Checks if the stack is empty.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement a simple stack data structure in C++ with push, pop, and peek operations along with error handling for underflow and overflow conditions, we can follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Define the Stack Class**: This class will handle the stack operations.\n2. **Use an Array for Storage**: We'll use a fixed-size array to store the stack elements.\n3. **Track the Top Element**: Use an integer variable to keep track of the top of the stack.\n4. **Implement Stack Operations**:\n   - `push`: Add an element to the top of the stack. Check for overflow.\n   - `pop`: Remove the top element from the stack. Check for underflow.\n   - `peek`: Return the top element without removing it. Check for underflow.\n   - `isFull`: Check if the stack is full.\n   - `isEmpty`: Check if the stack is empty.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Stack {\nprivate:\n    static const int MAX_SIZE = 100; // Define a maximum size for the stack\n    int arr[MAX_SIZE];\n    int top;\n\npublic:\n    Stack() : top(-1) {} // Constructor to initialize top to -1\n\n    bool isFull() {\n        return top == MAX_SIZE - 1;\n    }\n\n    bool isEmpty() {\n        return top == -1;\n    }\n\n    void push(int value) {\n        if (isFull()) {\n            cout << \"Error: Stack overflow. Cannot push \" << value << endl;\n            return;\n        }\n        arr[++top] = value;\n        cout << \"Pushed \" << value << \" to stack.\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    void pop() {\n        if (isEmpty()) {\n            cout << \"Error: Stack underflow. Cannot pop from empty stack.\" << endl;\n            return;\n        }\n        cout << \"Popped \" << arr[top] << \" from stack.\" << endl;\n        --top;\n    }\n\n    int peek() {\n        if (isEmpty()) {\n            cout << \"Error: Stack is empty. Cannot peek.\" << endl;\n            return -1; // Assuming -1 as an error value\n        }\n        return arr[top];\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Stack stack;\n\n    stack.push(10);\n    stack.push(20);\n    stack.push(30);\n    cout << \"Top element is: \" << stack.peek() << endl;\n    stack.pop();\n    cout << \"Top element is: \" << stack.peek() << endl;\n    stack.pop();\n    stack.pop();\n    stack.pop(); // This should cause underflow\n    stack.push(40);\n    cout << \"Top element is: \" << stack.peek() << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Class Definition**: \n   - `Stack` class manages stack operations with a fixed size array.\n\n2. **Member Variables**:\n   - `arr[MAX_SIZE]`: Array to store stack elements.\n   - `top`: Integer to track the top of the stack.\n\n3. **Methods**:\n   - `isFull()`: Checks if the stack is full.\n   - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.\n   - `push(int value)`: Adds an element to the stack. Handles overflow.\n   - `pop()`: Removes the top element from the stack. Handles underflow.\n   - `peek()`: Returns the top element without removing it. Handles underflow.\n\n4. **Main Function**:\n   - Demonstrates pushing, popping, and peeking operations.\n   - Includes scenarios that trigger underflow and overflow errors."
