        "content": "The French phrase you're referring to is \"Fin de Si\u00e8cle.\" It literally translates to \"end of the century\" and is used to describe the period, culture, and mood that characterized the end of the 19th century, particularly in Europe. This era was marked by significant social, economic, and cultural changes, including the birth of modernism in art, literature, and philosophy. The Fin de Si\u00e8cle period is often associated with decadence, pessimism, and a sense of exhaustion with traditional values, as well as a fascination with new ideas and technologies."
