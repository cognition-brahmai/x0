        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and we're told that its length is 4 meters longer than its width. Also, the area of the garden is 96 square meters. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if we can express both the length and the width in terms of a variable, we can set up an equation and solve for that variable.\n\nLet's denote the width of the garden as \\( w \\) meters. According to the problem, the length is 4 meters longer than the width, so the length would be \\( w + 4 \\) meters.\n\nNow, the area is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = (w + 4) \\times w = 96\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\n(w + 4) \\times w = 96\n\\]\n\nLet's expand this equation:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 4w = 96\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( w \\), we need to rearrange this equation into standard quadratic form. We can do this by subtracting 96 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 4w - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 4w - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nIn our equation, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), and \\( c = -96 \\). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-96)}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{400}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-4 \\pm 20}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two potential solutions for \\( w \\):\n\n1. \\( w = \\frac{-4 + 20}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\)\n\n2. \\( w = \\frac{-4 - 20}{2} = \\frac{-24}{2} = -12 \\)\n\nSince width cannot be negative, we discard \\( w = -12 \\). Therefore, the width is 8 meters.\n\nNow, we can find the length by adding 4 meters to the width:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = w + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 8 meters in width and 12 meters in length.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = w + 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = (w + 4)w = 96\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 4w - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 384}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{400}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 20}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( w = 8 \\) meters (since width can't be negative), and length = 8 + 4 = 12 meters.\n\nLet's verify the area:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 12 = 96 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the dimensions are indeed 8 meters by 12 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8 \\text{ meters by } 12 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
