        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The airline company wants to expand its fleet by purchasing new aircraft, and they have a budget of $1 billion for this expansion. Each aircraft costs $120 million and can accommodate up to 300 passengers. Additionally, they need to hire pilots and flight attendants for these new aircraft. Each aircraft requires two pilots and six flight attendants per flight. Pilots earn an average annual salary of $100,000, and flight attendants earn $50,000 per year. We need to figure out how many new aircraft the airline can purchase and the number of staff members needed to operate them, considering both the initial investment and ongoing personnel costs.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many aircraft the company can purchase with their $1 billion budget. Each aircraft costs $120 million, so we can divide the total budget by the cost per aircraft:\n\nNumber of aircraft = Total budget / Cost per aircraft\nNumber of aircraft = $1,000,000,000 / $120,000,000\nNumber of aircraft = 8.333...\n\nSince the company can't purchase a fraction of an aircraft, they can buy 8 aircraft with their budget. Now, let's calculate the total cost of purchasing these 8 aircraft:\n\nTotal cost of aircraft = Number of aircraft * Cost per aircraft\nTotal cost of aircraft = 8 * $120,000,000\nTotal cost of aircraft = $960,000,000\n\nSo, the company will spend $960 million on purchasing the aircraft, leaving them with $40 million from their $1 billion budget. But wait, we also need to consider the ongoing personnel costs for pilots and flight attendants.\n\nEach aircraft requires two pilots and six flight attendants per flight. Let's calculate the annual salary cost for the staff per aircraft:\n\nSalary cost per pilot = $100,000 per year\nSalary cost per flight attendant = $50,000 per year\n\nTotal salary cost per aircraft = (2 pilots * $100,000) + (6 flight attendants * $50,000)\nTotal salary cost per aircraft = ($200,000) + ($300,000)\nTotal salary cost per aircraft = $500,000 per year\n\nNow, for 8 aircraft, the total annual personnel cost would be:\n\nTotal annual personnel cost = Number of aircraft * Total salary cost per aircraft\nTotal annual personnel cost = 8 * $500,000\nTotal annual personnel cost = $4,000,000 per year\n\nSo, the ongoing personnel cost for 8 aircraft is $4 million per year.\n\nBut, we need to consider whether the remaining $40 million from the initial budget can cover any part of these ongoing costs. However, the initial budget is for the purchase of aircraft, and ongoing personnel costs are typically handled through the airline's operational budget on an annual basis. So, it's unlikely that the initial $1 billion budget is meant to cover ongoing costs.\n\nTherefore, the company can purchase 8 aircraft with their $1 billion budget, and they will need to hire staff for these aircraft, incurring an additional annual cost of $4 million.\n\nBut, perhaps there's more to consider. Maybe the company needs to finance part of the aircraft purchase, or maybe they have to consider other costs associated with the new aircraft, such as maintenance, fuel, etc. However, based on the information provided, we'll stick to the purchase cost and the personnel costs.\n\nLet's double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, number of aircraft:\n\n$1,000,000,000 / $120,000,000 = 8.333..., so 8 aircraft.\n\nTotal cost for 8 aircraft:\n\n8 * $120,000,000 = $960,000,000\n\nRemaining budget:\n\n$1,000,000,000 - $960,000,000 = $40,000,000\n\nPersonnel cost per aircraft:\n\n(2 pilots * $100,000) + (6 attendants * $50,000) = $200,000 + $300,000 = $500,000 per year\n\nTotal personnel cost for 8 aircraft:\n\n8 * $500,000 = $4,000,000 per year\n\nSeems correct.\n\nNow, perhaps the company could buy fewer aircraft to have more money left over for other expenses, but based on the given budget and costs, 8 aircraft seem to be the maximum they can purchase.\n\nAlternatively, if the company could get a discount on the aircraft or find a way to reduce costs, they might be able to purchase more aircraft, but with the given information, we'll assume the costs are fixed.\n\nAlso, it's possible that the company may need to hire more staff than just pilots and flight attendants, such as ground crew, maintenance\u4eba\u5458, etc., but again, based on the information provided, we're only considering pilots and flight attendants.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the airline can purchase 8 new aircraft with their $1 billion budget, and they will need to hire staff for these aircraft, incurring an additional annual cost of $4 million for personnel.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8 \\text{ aircraft and } 8 \\times (2 \\text{ pilots} + 6 \\text{ flight attendants}) = 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\text{ staff members}} \\]"
