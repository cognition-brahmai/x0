        "content": "So I need to prove that a connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges is a tree. Alright, let's start by recalling what a tree is in graph theory. A tree is a connected acyclic graph. So, to prove that our graph is a tree, I need to show two things: that it's connected and that it has no cycles.\n\nWait, but the problem already says the graph is connected, so I only need to show that it has no cycles. Alternatively, since trees have specific properties, maybe I can use some other properties to show that it must be a tree.\n\nI remember that in a tree with n vertices, there are exactly n-1 edges. That seems relevant here. So, if I can show that any connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges has no cycles, then I've proven it's a tree.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the graph has a cycle. What would that imply?\n\nIf there's a cycle, then there's at least one loop in the graph where you can start at a vertex and return to it without repeating any edges. Now, in a graph with cycles, I think the number of edges is at least equal to the number of vertices, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, no. A graph can have cycles with fewer edges than vertices, but in this case, we have exactly n-1 edges. Maybe I should consider what happens when we add edges to a tree.\n\nI know that a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges, and if I add one more edge to it, it will create exactly one cycle. So, if I have a connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges, and I add one more edge, it should create a cycle.\n\nBut in our case, the graph already has n-1 edges and is connected. If I try to add another edge, it would indeed create a cycle, but that doesn't directly help me prove that the original graph has no cycles.\n\nMaybe I should consider the number of components in the graph. I know that in a forest (which is a disjoint union of trees), the number of edges is equal to the number of vertices minus the number of trees in the forest. So, if the graph is connected, meaning it has only one component, then the number of edges should be n - 1, which matches what we have.\n\nBut again, I need to show that there are no cycles. Perhaps I can use induction on the number of vertices.\n\nLet's try that. Base case: n = 1. A graph with one vertex and no edges is a tree, and it has no cycles. That checks out.\n\nNow, assume that for some k >= 1, any connected graph with k vertices and k-1 edges is a tree, meaning it has no cycles. Now, consider a connected graph with k+1 vertices and k edges.\n\nI need to show that this graph has no cycles. Suppose, for contradiction, that it has a cycle. Let's see what happens if I remove one edge from the cycle. The graph should still be connected because there are other paths between any two vertices due to the remaining edges in the cycle.\n\nWait, but actually, removing one edge from a cycle doesn't disconnect the graph. So, the graph remains connected after removing one edge from the cycle.\n\nNow, the graph has k+1 vertices and k-1 edges. But according to the induction hypothesis, a connected graph with k+1 vertices should have k edges, not k-1, unless it's not connected.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider starting from a tree and adding edges to see what happens.\n\nI know that a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges and no cycles. If I add an edge to a tree, I create exactly one cycle. So, if I have a connected graph with n vertices and more than n-1 edges, it must have at least one cycle.\n\nIn our case, the graph has exactly n-1 edges, and it's connected, so adding any edge would create a cycle, but that doesn't directly tell me that the graph itself has no cycles.\n\nMaybe I can use the concept of a spanning tree. A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that is a tree and includes all the vertices of the graph.\n\nIf my graph has exactly n-1 edges and is connected, perhaps it is already a spanning tree of itself, meaning it has no extra edges beyond those needed to connect the vertices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the sum of degrees of vertices.\n\nI know that the sum of degrees is twice the number of edges, so in this graph, the sum of degrees is 2(n-1).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly in proving there are no cycles.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the graph has a cycle. Then, in that cycle, there are at least as many edges as vertices in the cycle.\n\nWait, no, in a cycle, the number of edges equals the number of vertices in the cycle.\n\nSo, if there is a cycle of length k, then there are k edges and k vertices in the cycle.\n\nNow, the rest of the graph has n - k vertices and some number of edges.\n\nSince the graph is connected, the cycle must be connected to the rest of the graph.\n\nSo, there must be at least one edge connecting the cycle to the rest of the graph.\n\nWait, but if the graph has only n-1 edges in total, and the cycle already uses k edges, then the remaining edges are n-1 - k.\n\nBut the rest of the graph has n - k vertices, and to connect them, we need at least n - k - 1 edges, assuming they form a tree.\n\nWait, but n - 1 - k edges are available for n - k vertices.\n\nSo, the number of edges for the rest of the graph is n - 1 - k.\n\nTo connect n - k vertices, a tree would require n - k - 1 edges.\n\nSo, n - 1 - k >= n - k - 1, which is true because both sides equal n - k - 1.\n\nSo, equality holds, meaning the rest of the graph must be a tree.\n\nTherefore, the entire graph consists of a cycle of length k and a tree of n - k vertices, connected by at least one edge.\n\nBut wait, if the cycle is connected to the rest of the graph, then there must be at least one edge from the cycle to the rest of the graph.\n\nHowever, in this setup, the number of edges is exactly n - 1, which is the minimum required for connectivity.\n\nBut if there is a cycle, then there are redundant edges, which contradicts the fact that the graph has exactly n - 1 edges.\n\nWait, is that a valid argument?\n\nLet me see. If there is a cycle, then there are multiple paths between some pairs of vertices.\n\nBut in a graph with exactly n - 1 edges, there are no redundant edges; every edge is necessary for connectivity.\n\nSo, the presence of a cycle would imply the existence of redundant edges, which contradicts the edge count.\n\nTherefore, the graph cannot have any cycles.\n\nHence, it must be a tree.\n\nThat seems like a reasonable argument.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the formula for trees.\n\nI know that for a tree, the number of edges is always n - 1, where n is the number of vertices, and the graph is connected and acyclic.\n\nSince our graph satisfies the connectedness and has exactly n - 1 edges, it must be acyclic, hence a tree.\n\nI think that wraps up the proof.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The graph is a tree.}}"
