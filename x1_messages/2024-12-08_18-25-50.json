        "content": "Let's see. There are four people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many people there are and how many handshakes each one makes. There are four people, so let's call them Person A, Person B, Person C, and Person D.\n\nPerson A shakes hands with Person B, Person C, and Person D. That's three handshakes.\n\nPerson B has already shaken hands with Person A, so they only need to shake hands with Person C and Person D. That's two more handshakes.\n\nPerson C has already shaken hands with Person A and Person B, so they only need to shake hands with Person D. That's one more handshake.\n\nPerson D has already shaken hands with Person A, Person B, and Person C, so they don't need to shake hands with anyone else.\n\nSo, total handshakes are 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it using combinations. Since each handshake is between two people, and the order doesn't matter (A shaking hands with B is the same as B shaking hands with A), it's a combination problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 people out of 4 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nSo, again, there are 6 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe using graphs. If each person is a node and each handshake is an edge connecting two nodes, then this is like finding the number of edges in a complete graph with 4 nodes.\n\nIn a complete graph with n nodes, the number of edges is given by C(n, 2), which is the same as n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=4, number of edges = 4 \u00d7 3 / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6.\n\nAgain, 6 handshakes.\n\nLet me try to list them out to be sure.\n\nHandshakes:\n\n1. A with B\n\n2. A with C\n\n3. A with D\n\n4. B with C\n\n5. B with D\n\n6. C with D\n\nTotal: 6 handshakes.\n\nOkay, so all these different methods lead me to the same answer: there are 6 handshakes.\n\nBut wait, what if there were a different number of people? Is there a general formula I can use?\n\nYes, the general formula is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of people.\n\nSo, for 4 people: 4 \u00d7 3 / 2 = 6.\n\nFor 5 people: 5 \u00d7 4 / 2 = 10.\n\nFor 10 people: 10 \u00d7 9 / 2 = 45.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nNow, is there any other way this could be interpreted? For example, what if some people don't shake hands with each other? But the problem says each person shakes hands with every other person once, so no exceptions.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer is 6 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
