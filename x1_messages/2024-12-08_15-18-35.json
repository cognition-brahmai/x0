It extensively deals with the theory and practice of politics, and the analysis of political systems, political behavior, and political culture. International relations, as a discipline, is a branch of political science that studies relationships among countries, the roles of sovereign states, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and multinational corporations. Which of the following is not typically a subject of study in political science?\nA. The theory and practice of politics.\nB. The roles of sovereign states in international relations.\nC. The process of photosynthesis in plants.\nD. The analysis of political systems and political behavior."

        "content": "Let's see here. I have this question about political science and what isn't typically studied within it. So, political science is all about governance, politics, and how societies are run. It looks at how people interact in terms of power, making decisions, and stuff like that. International relations is a part of political science that focuses on how countries interact with each other, including their governments, organizations, and big companies that operate across borders.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options isn't usually studied in political science. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"The theory and practice of politics.\" That sounds right; political science is all about understanding political theories and how they play out in real life. So, that's definitely part of political science.\n\nOption B mentions, \"The roles of sovereign states in international relations.\" Since international relations is a branch of political science, studying how countries behave and interact is a core part of it. So, that's included too.\n\nOption C is about \"The process of photosynthesis in plants.\" Hmm, photosynthesis is something plants do to make their food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. That sounds like biology to me, not political science. Political science doesn't deal with plant biology; it's more about human societies and their governance.\n\nOption D says, \"The analysis of political systems and political behavior.\" Again, that's exactly what political science is about\u2014looking at different types of governments, how they function, and how people behave within those systems.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like option C, \"The process of photosynthesis in plants,\" is not typically a subject of study in political science. It belongs to biology or botany instead.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
