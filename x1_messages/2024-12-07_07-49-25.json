        "content": "Assuming that a standard sheet of paper is about 0.0039 inches thick, we can calculate the height of a stack of 1 million sheets.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total thickness in inches:\n\n1,000,000 sheets * 0.0039 inches/sheet = 3,900 inches\n\nNow, to convert inches to feet, we know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. So,\n\n3,900 inches \u00f7 12 inches/foot = 325 feet\n\nTherefore, a stack of 1 million sheets of paper would be approximately 325 feet tall.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that paper thickness value to ensure accuracy. In reality, standard printer paper is about 0.004 inches thick. If we use that value:\n\n1,000,000 sheets * 0.004 inches/sheet = 4,000 inches\n\nNow, converting to feet:\n\n4,000 inches \u00f7 12 inches/foot = 333.333 feet\n\nSo, using a more precise thickness, the stack would be about 333.333 feet tall.\n\nHowever, in real life, paper stacks compress under their own weight, especially at such heights, so the actual height might be less due to compression.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that stacking paper to such heights would be impractical due to structural instability and the sheer weight of the stack.\n\nBut for the sake of this theoretical question, assuming no compression and perfect stacking, the height would be approximately 333.333 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{333.333} \\]"
