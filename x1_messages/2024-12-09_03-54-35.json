        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, 40% of the people own cats, and 30% own dogs. But, 10% own both cats and dogs. I need to find out what percentage don't own any pets at all.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many people own at least one pet. That would be the people who own cats or dogs or both. But, if I just add the cat owners and dog owners together, that would be 40% + 30% = 70%. However, that counts the people who own both cats and dogs twice, once in the cat owners and once in the dog owners.\n\nSo, to correct for that, I need to subtract the percentage that owns both. That is, 70% - 10% = 60%. So, 60% of the people own at least one pet.\n\nNow, to find out who doesn't own any pets, I can subtract that 60% from 100%, since 100% is the total population of the town.\n\n100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nTherefore, 40% of the people in the town do not own any pets.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 40% own cats and 30% own dogs, and 10% own both, then the number of people who own only cats would be 40% - 10% = 30%, and the number who own only dogs would be 30% - 10% = 20%. Then, adding those up: only cats (30%), only dogs (20%), and both (10%), which totals 60%. So, yes, 100% - 60% = 40% do not own any pets.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula for the union of two sets is:\n\nOwnership of cats or dogs = ownership of cats + ownership of dogs - ownership of both.\n\nSo, it's 40% + 30% - 10% = 60%, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the percentage that doesn't own any pets is indeed 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
