        "content": "So the problem says that every third person in a line gets a balloon, and there are 150 people in line. I need to figure out how many balloons will be given away.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"every third person\" means. It means that for every group of three people, one person gets a balloon. So, it's like dividing the total number of people by three to find out how many balloons are given.\n\nSo, if there are 150 people, I can divide 150 by 3 to get the number of balloons.\n\nLet me do that: 150 divided by 3 is 50. So, 50 balloons will be given away.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check this to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's a different way to look at it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the positions of the people in line. If every third person gets a balloon, that means people in positions 3, 6, 9, and so on, up to 150, will get a balloon.\n\nSo, the positions are multiples of 3. To find out how many multiples of 3 there are up to 150, I can again divide 150 by 3.\n\nAgain, that gives me 50.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is 50 balloons.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using subtraction or addition instead of division.\n\nLet's see, if I start from the first person and count every third person, like person 3, person 6, and so on, incrementing by 3 each time, how many times can I do this before reaching or exceeding 150?\n\nThat's essentially the same as dividing 150 by 3, which again gives me 50.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a sequence: 3, 6, 9, ..., up to 150. This is an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 3.\n\nTo find the number of terms in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, a_1 is 3, d is 3, and a_n is 150.\n\nSo, 150 = 3 + (n-1)*3.\n\nLet me solve for n:\n\n150 = 3 + 3(n-1)\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n147 = 3(n-1)\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n49 = n-1\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\nn = 50\n\nSo, there are 50 terms in this sequence, meaning 50 people will get balloons.\n\nThis confirms my earlier answer.\n\nIs there any chance that the answer could be different? For example, if the line has fewer than 150 people, or if the spacing for balloons is different, but in this case, with 150 people and every third person getting a balloon, it seems clear that 50 balloons will be given away.\n\nWait a minute, what if the line isn't perfectly divisible by 3? What if there were, say, 151 people? Then, 151 divided by 3 is 50 with a remainder of 1. So, only 50 people would get balloons, since the last person doesn't complete another set of three.\n\nBut in this case, 150 is perfectly divisible by 3, so there's no remainder.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 50 balloons.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but it's always good to double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that for every group of 3 people, one balloon is given. So, with 150 people, there are 150/3 = 50 groups, and hence 50 balloons.\n\nThis matches all the previous methods I used.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 50 balloons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
