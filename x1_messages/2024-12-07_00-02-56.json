        "content": "So I've got this matrix B, which is:\n\nB = [[5, 4],\n\n     [2, 3]]\n\nAnd I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I remember that eigenvalues are scalars and eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that only get scaled by the matrix transformation, right? So, to find them, I need to solve the characteristic equation.\n\nFirst, I need to find the determinant of (B - \u03bbI), where \u03bb is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. So, B - \u03bbI would be:\n\n[[5 - \u03bb, 4],\n\n [2, 3 - \u03bb]]\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix is (5 - \u03bb)(3 - \u03bb) - (4)(2) = \u03bb^2 - 8\u03bb + 7.\n\nSetting this equal to zero gives the characteristic equation: \u03bb^2 - 8\u03bb + 7 = 0.\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, I get \u03bb = [8 \u00b1 sqrt(64 - 28)] / 2 = [8 \u00b1 sqrt(36)] / 2 = [8 \u00b1 6] / 2.\n\nSo, \u03bb1 = (8 + 6)/2 = 14/2 = 7 and \u03bb2 = (8 - 6)/2 = 2/2 = 1.\n\nGreat, so the eigenvalues are 7 and 1.\n\nNow, to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue, I need to solve (B - \u03bbI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFirst, for \u03bb = 7:\n\nB - 7I = [[5 - 7, 4],\n\n          [2, 3 - 7]] = [[-2, 4],\n\n                         [2, -4]]\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n-2v1 + 4v2 = 0\n\n2v1 - 4v2 = 0\n\nThese equations are dependent, so I can just use one of them. Let's use the first one: -2v1 + 4v2 = 0 => v1 = 2v2.\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = 7 can be any scalar multiple of [2, 1]. For simplicity, let's take [2, 1].\n\nNext, for \u03bb = 1:\n\nB - I = [[5 - 1, 4],\n\n         [2, 3 - 1]] = [[4, 4],\n\n                        [2, 2]]\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n4v1 + 4v2 = 0\n\n2v1 + 2v2 = 0\n\nAgain, these equations are dependent. Using the first one: 4v1 + 4v2 = 0 => v1 = -v2.\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = 1 can be any scalar multiple of [-1, 1]. Let's take [-1, 1].\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix B are:\n\nFor \u03bb = 7, v = [2, 1]\n\nFor \u03bb = 1, v = [-1, 1]\n\nI think that's it. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the characteristic equation: det(B - \u03bbI) = (5 - \u03bb)(3 - \u03bb) - 8 = \u03bb^2 - 8\u03bb + 7. That seems correct.\n\nSolving \u03bb^2 - 8\u03bb + 7 = 0 gives \u03bb = 7 and \u03bb = 1. Okay.\n\nThen, for \u03bb = 7, B - 7I = [[-2, 4], [2, -4]], and the eigenvector is [2, 1]. Yes, because -2*2 + 4*1 = 0.\n\nFor \u03bb = 1, B - I = [[4, 4], [2, 2]], and the eigenvector is [-1, 1]. Check: 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 0. Good.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda = 7 \\) and \\( \\lambda = 1 \\), with corresponding eigenvectors \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), respectively."
