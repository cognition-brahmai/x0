        "content": "So I have this probability question here: In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what's the probability of drawing four cards with the same rank, like four Aces or four Kings, and so on. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in a standard deck. There are 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 ranks: Ace through 10, and then Jack, Queen, King. So, there are 4 cards of each rank in the deck.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of drawing four cards all of the same rank. I assume that the drawing is done without replacement, meaning once a card is drawn, it's not put back into the deck.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to draw 4 cards from 52 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Here, n = 52 and k = 4.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(52, 4) = 52! / (4!(52 - 4)!) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 270725.\n\nSo, there are 270,725 possible ways to draw 4 cards from a deck of 52.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many of these combinations consist of all four cards being of the same rank.\n\nWell, there are 13 ranks in total (Ace through King), and for each rank, there are exactly 4 cards (one from each suit). So, for each rank, there is only one way to choose all four cards of that rank.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable combinations is equal to the number of ranks, which is 13.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nFor example, for Aces: there are 4 Aces in the deck, and there's only one way to choose all four of them: Ace of hearts, Ace of diamonds, Ace of clubs, and Ace of spades.\n\nSimilarly, for Kings, Queens, etc., each rank has exactly four cards, and only one way to choose all four.\n\nSo, yes, there are 13 such favorable combinations.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = 13 / 270725.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n13 divided by 270,725 is approximately 0.000048, or 4.8 \u00d7 10^-5.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as a fraction: 13 / 270725.\n\nBut maybe I can simplify that fraction.\n\nLet's see, does 13 divide into 270,725?\n\nWell, 270,725 divided by 13 is 20,825, because 13 \u00d7 20,825 = 270,725.\n\nSo, 13 / 270725 = 1 / 20825.\n\nSo, the probability is 1 in 20,825.\n\nThat seems pretty low, which makes sense because the chance of drawing four of a kind is rare.\n\nWait a second, I recall that in poker, the probability of getting a four of a kind hand is about 1 in 625, but that's for a 5-card hand. Maybe I'm confusing it with this problem.\n\nHold on, let's clarify.\n\nIn poker, a four of a kind hand consists of four cards of the same rank and one card of another rank. So, it's not exactly the same as drawing four cards all of the same rank.\n\nIn this problem, we're drawing exactly four cards, and all four must be of the same rank.\n\nWhereas in poker, you draw five cards, and four of them are of the same rank, and the fifth is different.\n\nSo, those are different scenarios.\n\nMaybe I should verify my calculation.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the probability of drawing four cards all of the same rank can be calculated step by step.\n\nFirst, draw any card. The rank of this card doesn't matter. Then, the next three cards must match the rank of the first card.\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\n1 (since the first card can be any card) \u00d7\n\n(3/51) (since there are 3 remaining cards of the same rank out of 51 remaining cards) \u00d7\n\n(2/50) (then 2 out of 50) \u00d7\n\n(1/49) (finally 1 out of 49).\n\nSo, that's 1 \u00d7 (3/51) \u00d7 (2/50) \u00d7 (1/49).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 3/51 = 1/17.\n\nThen, 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nThen, 1/49.\n\nSo, the probability is (1/17) \u00d7 (1/25) \u00d7 (1/49) = 1 / (17 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 49).\n\nLet's compute 17 \u00d7 25 = 425.\n\nThen, 425 \u00d7 49.\n\nWell, 400 \u00d7 49 = 19,600.\n\n25 \u00d7 49 = 1,225.\n\nSo, total denominator is 19,600 + 1,225 = 20,825.\n\nSo, probability is 1 / 20,825.\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier: 1 / 20,825, or approximately 0.000048.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the combination approach, total ways to choose 4 cards: C(52, 4) = 270,725.\n\nNumber of favorable ways: 13 (one for each rank).\n\nSo, probability is 13 / 270725 = 1 / 20825.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to consider that there are 13 possible ranks, and for each rank, there's only one way to choose all four cards of that rank.\n\nSo, number of favorable combinations is 13 \u00d7 1 = 13.\n\nTherefore, probability is 13 / 270725 = 1 / 20825.\n\nAlright, I think this confirms that the probability is indeed 1 in 20,825.\n\nJust to put that into perspective, that's a very low probability. For example, if you were to draw four cards from a deck, you'd have to do it about 20,825 times on average to get four cards of the same rank once.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of percentages, that's about 0.0048%, which is a tiny percentage.\n\nSo, it's a rare event.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{20825}} \\]"
