        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 15 people at a family gathering, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem about combinations. You know, like how many different ways can you pair up people for handshakes.\n\nI recall that in combinations, the order doesn't matter. So, shaking hands is a mutual thing; if person A shakes hands with person B, it's the same as person B shaking hands with person A. So, it's not like permutations where the order matters.\n\nSo, the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n would be 15, since there are 15 people, and k would be 2, because handshakes are between 2 people.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: C(15, 2) = 15! / (2!(15 - 2)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 13!) = (15 \u00d7 14) / 2 = 210 / 2 = 105.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAnother way is to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person. So, the first person shakes hands with 14 others, the second person shakes hands with 13 remaining people (since they already shook hands with the first), the third shakes hands with 12, and so on, until the last person, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they already did.\n\nSo, total handshakes would be 14 + 13 + 12 + ... + 1.\n\nThis is an arithmetic series, where the first term a1 is 14, the last term an is 1, and the number of terms is 14.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 \u00d7 (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms.\n\nSo, S = 14/2 \u00d7 (14 + 1) = 7 \u00d7 15 = 105.\n\nOkay, that matches the combination formula result. So, there are 105 handshakes in total.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of the formula n(n-1)/2 for the number of handshakes or connections in a complete graph, where n is the number of vertices (people, in this case).\n\nSo, for n=15, it would be 15 \u00d7 14 / 2 = 210 / 2 = 105.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it through different methods: combinations, arithmetic series, and the handshake formula. All of them point to 105 handshakes.\n\nSo, the answer should be 105.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
