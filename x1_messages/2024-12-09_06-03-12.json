        "content": "Let's see... There are 4 cats in the room, and each cat catches 3 mice per day. So, first, I need to find out how many mice all the cats catch together in a day.\n\nIf one cat catches 3 mice, then 4 cats would catch 4 times 3, which is 12 mice per day.\n\nNow, each mouse eats 2 pieces of cheese before being caught. So, if 12 mice are caught, and each had eaten 2 pieces of cheese, then the total pieces of cheese eaten by these mice would be 12 times 2, which is 24 pieces.\n\nBut since the cats caught these mice, those 24 pieces of cheese aren't eaten by the mice anymore. So, in a way, the cats have saved those 24 pieces of cheese.\n\nWait a minute, is there more to this? Let me think again.\n\nWe have 4 cats, each catching 3 mice per day, totaling 12 mice per day.\n\nEach of these 12 mice would have eaten 2 pieces of cheese if they hadn't been caught. So, by catching these mice, the cats have prevented those 24 pieces of cheese from being eaten.\n\nTherefore, the cats save 24 pieces of cheese per day by catching the mice.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
