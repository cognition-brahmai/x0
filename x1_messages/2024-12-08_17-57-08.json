        "content": "Alright, I'll help you create a simple command-line calculator in Python. This calculator will take two numbers and an operator as input and perform the corresponding operation. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to get input from the user. We'll ask for two numbers and the operator they want to use. Python has a built-in function called `input()` that we can use for this purpose.\n\nNext, we need to perform the operation based on the operator provided. We can use conditional statements, like if-elif-else, to check which operator was entered and then perform the appropriate operation.\n\nWe also need to handle possible errors, such as division by zero or invalid operators. This will make our calculator more robust and user-friendly.\n\nLet's start by writing the code to get input from the user.\n\n```python\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\noperator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n```\n\nHere, we're using `float()` to convert the input strings to floating-point numbers, which allows for decimal inputs.\n\nNow, we'll use conditional statements to perform the operation based on the operator.\n\n```python\nif operator == \"+\":\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == \"-\":\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == \"*\":\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        result = \"Error: Division by zero\"\nelse:\n    result = \"Invalid operator\"\n```\n\nIn this code, we check the operator and perform the corresponding operation. If the operator is division (/), we also check if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nFinally, we'll print the result.\n\n```python\nprint(result)\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the complete script looks like this:\n\n```python\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\noperator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\nif operator == \"+\":\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == \"-\":\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == \"*\":\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        result = \"Error: Division by zero\"\nelse:\n    result = \"Invalid operator\"\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nYou can run this script in your command line or terminal, and it will prompt you to enter the numbers and operator. It will then display the result of the operation.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
