        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 6 pairs of black socks and 4 pairs of white socks in a drawer, and I need to pick out a matching pair in the dark. The question is, what's the minimum number of socks I need to take out to ensure I have a matching pair?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It's not about the probability of picking a matching pair, but rather about guaranteeing that I have a matching pair, no matter how the socks are arranged or how I pick them.\n\nSo, there are black socks and white socks, and pairs mean two socks of the same color. Since the room is dark, I can't see the colors, so I have to consider the worst-case scenario to ensure I have a matching pair.\n\nLet's think about the worst that could happen. Suppose I pick one sock, and it's black. Then I pick another sock, and it's white. Now, I have one black and one white sock, but they don't match.\n\nSo, to guarantee a matching pair, I need to pick at least one more sock. If I pick a third sock, it could be either black or white.\n\n- If it's black, then I have two black socks, which match.\n\n- If it's white, then I have two white socks, which match.\n\nSo, in this case, picking three socks ensures that I have a matching pair.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that picking three socks wouldn't guarantee a matching pair? Let's think about it.\n\nSuppose I pick one black sock, one white sock, and then another black sock. Now, I have two black socks and one white sock, which includes a matching pair of black socks.\n\nAlternatively, if I pick one black sock, one white sock, and then another white sock, I have two white socks and one black sock, which includes a matching pair of white socks.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, I end up with a matching pair by picking three socks.\n\nBut is there a way to have three socks without a matching pair? Let's see.\n\nIf I pick one black and one white, that's no match. Picking a third sock will always result in a match because it will either match the black or the white sock I already have.\n\nTherefore, three socks are sufficient to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nBut is there a way to do it with fewer than three socks? Let's consider picking two socks.\n\nIf I pick two socks, there are a few possibilities:\n\n- Both are black: that's a matching pair.\n\n- Both are white: that's a matching pair.\n\n- One is black and one is white: no match.\n\nSo, in the case where I pick one black and one white sock, I don't have a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, picking two socks does not guarantee a matching pair because there's a possibility of getting one of each color.\n\nHence, three socks are necessary to ensure that I have at least one matching pair.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way to think about this. Let's consider the number of different colors. There are only two colors: black and white.\n\nIn the worst case, I could pick one sock of each color, which would be one black and one white. That's two socks without a match.\n\nBut as soon as I pick a third sock, it has to be either black or white, and whichever it is, it will match one of the socks I already have.\n\nSo, yes, three socks are the minimum needed to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider here? Like the number of pairs available.\n\nThere are 6 pairs of black socks and 4 pairs of white socks, which means there are 12 black socks and 8 white socks in total.\n\nBut the number of socks of each color doesn't change the logic here because even if there were a large imbalance in the number of black and white socks, the worst-case scenario is still picking one of each color first.\n\nAfter that, the next pick will necessarily result in a match.\n\nSo, regardless of the total numbers, as long as there are only two colors, the minimum number of socks to pick to guarantee a matching pair is three.\n\nWait, is this a general rule? Let's generalize it.\n\nIf there are 'c' different colors, what is the minimum number of socks to pick to guarantee a matching pair?\n\nIn that case, in the worst scenario, I could pick one sock of each color first. That would be 'c' socks without a match.\n\nThen, the next sock I pick, no matter the color, will match one of the socks I already have.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number to guarantee a match is 'c + 1'.\n\nIn this problem, there are two colors, so 'c = 2', and 'c + 1 = 3'.\n\nHence, three socks are needed.\n\nSo, the answer should be three.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose there are more colors. For example, if there were three colors: black, white, and blue.\n\nIn that case, the worst scenario would be picking one of each color, which is three socks without a match.\n\nThen, the fourth sock picked would match one of the three colors already picked.\n\nSo, for three colors, four socks are needed to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nBut in our problem, there are only two colors, so three socks should suffice.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is three.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the pigeonhole principle.\n\nThe pigeonhole principle states that if you have 'n' items and 'm' containers, and 'n > m', then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, the \"containers\" are the colors, and the \"items\" are the socks picked.\n\nThere are two colors (containers), and we want to ensure that at least one color has at least two socks (a pair).\n\nSo, according to the pigeonhole principle, to ensure that at least one container has more than one item, I need to have at least 'number of containers + 1' items.\n\nThat is, '2 + 1 = 3' socks.\n\nTherefore, picking three socks guarantees that at least one color has at least two socks, which is a matching pair.\n\nSo, the answer is three.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the numbers of socks in the drawer affect this.\n\nSuppose there were only one pair of black socks and one pair of white socks, so two black and two white socks in total.\n\nIf I pick three socks, in the worst case, I could pick two of one color and one of the other.\n\nBut still, among those three, there would be at least one matching pair.\n\nSimilarly, with larger numbers, as in the original problem with 12 black and 8 white socks, picking three socks still guarantees a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is three.\n\nIs there any scenario where picking three socks wouldn't guarantee a matching pair?\n\nI can't think of one, given that there are only two colors.\n\nIf there were more colors, then yes, but in this case, with only two colors, three socks should suffice.\n\nHence, the final answer is three.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
