        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells books and magazines. The price of a book is $12, and a magazine is $4. A customer buys a total of 10 items and spends $80. We need to find out how many books and magazines they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of books.\n\n- Let \\( m \\) represent the number of magazines.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of items is 10.\n\n2. The total cost is $80.\n\nSo, we can set up two equations based on this information.\n\nThe first equation is about the total number of items:\n\n\\[ b + m = 10 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total cost:\n\n\\[ 12b + 4m = 80 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I\u2019ll use the substitution method here.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express \\( m \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ m = 10 - b \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( m \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 12b + 4(10 - b) = 80 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify and solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ 12b + 40 - 4b = 80 \\]\n\n\\[ 8b + 40 = 80 \\]\n\n\\[ 8b = 80 - 40 \\]\n\n\\[ 8b = 40 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( b = 5 \\), we can find \\( m \\) using the first equation:\n\n\\[ m = 10 - b \\]\n\n\\[ m = 10 - 5 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 5 books and 5 magazines.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they bought 5 books at $12 each, that\u2019s \\( 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\) dollars. Plus 5 magazines at $4 each, that\u2019s \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) dollars. Total spent is \\( 60 + 20 = 80 \\) dollars, which matches the given total. Also, the total number of items is \\( 5 + 5 = 10 \\), which also matches. So, our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ books and } 5 \\text{ magazines}} \\]"
