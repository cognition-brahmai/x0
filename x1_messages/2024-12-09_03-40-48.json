        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a farmer has 100 meters of fencing material and wants to create a rectangular enclosure for his sheep. I need to figure out what dimensions of the rectangle will maximize the enclosed area. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, so let's call the length of one pair \"length\" or \"l\" and the other pair \"width\" or \"w.\" The perimeter of the rectangle, which is the total length of fencing needed, is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter (P) = 2l + 2w\n\nThe farmer has 100 meters of fencing, so P = 100 meters. So,\n\n2l + 2w = 100\n\nI can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nl + w = 50\n\nNow, I need to maximize the area (A) of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by:\n\nA = l * w\n\nSo, I have two variables here, l and w, but they're related by the equation l + w = 50. I need to express the area in terms of one variable only, so I can then find the maximum area.\n\nLet me solve for one variable in terms of the other. From l + w = 50, I can express w in terms of l:\n\nw = 50 - l\n\nNow, substitute this into the area formula:\n\nA = l * (50 - l)\n\nA = 50l - l\u00b2\n\nSo, the area A is a function of l: A(l) = 50l - l\u00b2\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of l, and it's in the form A = -l\u00b2 + 50l. Quadratic functions graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of l\u00b2 is negative, this parabola opens downwards, meaning it has a maximum point.\n\nThe maximum value of a quadratic function f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c occurs at x = -b/(2a). So, in this case, a = -1 and b = 50.\n\nTherefore, the length l that maximizes the area is:\n\nl = -50 / (2 * -1) = 25 meters\n\nNow, substitute l back into the equation for w:\n\nw = 50 - l = 50 - 25 = 25 meters\n\nWait a minute, so both length and width are 25 meters? That means the rectangle is actually a square.\n\nIs that right? Let me double-check.\n\nIf l = 25 meters and w = 25 meters, then the perimeter is 2*25 + 2*25 = 100 meters, which matches the given fencing material.\n\nAnd the area would be 25 * 25 = 625 square meters.\n\nIs there a way to get a larger area with the same perimeter?\n\nLet me try different dimensions. Suppose I choose l = 30 meters, then w = 50 - 30 = 20 meters.\n\nArea = 30 * 20 = 600 square meters, which is less than 625.\n\nWhat if l = 20 meters, then w = 30 meters.\n\nArea = 20 * 30 = 600 square meters again.\n\nWhat about l = 10 meters, then w = 40 meters.\n\nArea = 10 * 40 = 400 square meters, which is even less.\n\nSeems like 25 meters by 25 meters gives the maximum area.\n\nLet me consider another approach to confirm this.\n\nI recall that for a given perimeter, the shape that maximizes the area is a circle. But here, we're dealing with a rectangle. Maybe I can compare the area of this square to that of a circle with the same perimeter.\n\nThe perimeter of a circle is given by P = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius.\n\nGiven P = 100 meters,\n\n2\u03c0r = 100\n\nr = 100 / (2\u03c0) = 50/\u03c0 meters\n\nThe area of the circle is A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*(50/\u03c0)\u00b2 = \u03c0*(2500/\u03c0\u00b2) = 2500/\u03c0 \u2248 796.18 square meters.\n\nThat's larger than the square's area of 625 square meters. But of course, the farmer wants a rectangular enclosure, not a circular one.\n\nSo, among all rectangles with perimeter 100 meters, the square gives the maximum area.\n\nAlternatively, I can use calculus to find the maximum area.\n\nStarting from A(l) = 50l - l\u00b2\n\nTo find the maximum, take the derivative of A with respect to l and set it to zero.\n\ndA/dl = 50 - 2l\n\nSet dA/dl = 0:\n\n50 - 2l = 0\n\n2l = 50\n\nl = 25 meters\n\nThen, w = 50 - l = 25 meters\n\nAgain, this confirms that the square gives the maximum area.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check the second derivative to ensure it's a maximum.\n\nd\u00b2A/dl\u00b2 = -2\n\nSince d\u00b2A/dl\u00b2 < 0, the critical point at l = 25 is indeed a maximum.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions that maximize the enclosed area are 25 meters by 25 meters, forming a square enclosure with an area of 625 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25 \\text{ meters by } 25 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
