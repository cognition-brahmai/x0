Some of his notable works include \"Carrie,\" \"The Shining,\" \"It,\" and \"Misery.\" The use of the pen name Richard Bachman was employed by King to publish books without the overwhelming expectation that came with his own name. This practice began in the late 1970s and continued into the 1980s until it was publicly revealed that King was indeed Bachman."
