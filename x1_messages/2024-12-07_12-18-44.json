The expression is:\n\n((4 * 3) - 2^3 + 6) / (5 - 1)\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate 4 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(12 - 2^3 + 6) / (5 - 1)\n\n2. Next, handle the exponent:\n\n2^3 = 8\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(12 - 8 + 6) / (5 - 1)\n\n3. Now, perform the operations inside the parentheses from left to right:\n\nFirst, 12 - 8:\n\n12 - 8 = 4\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(4 + 6) / (5 - 1)\n\nNext, 4 + 6:\n\n4 + 6 = 10\n\nSo now it's:\n\n10 / (5 - 1)\n\n4. Now, calculate the denominator:\n\n5 - 1 = 4\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n10 / 4\n\n5. Finally, perform the division:\n\n10 / 4 = 2.5\n\nSo, the final answer is 2.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5} \\]"
