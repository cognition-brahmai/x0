        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Ruby script that reads email addresses from a text file, filters out the invalid ones using regular expressions, and then saves the valid ones to a new file. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a valid email address. According to standard internet protocols, an email address has a specific format: it should have a local part, followed by the \"@\" symbol, and then a domain part. The domain part should include a domain name and a top-level domain.\n\nBut regular expressions can be tricky, especially for email validation, because email formats can be quite complex. I should look up a reliable regular expression for validating email addresses. Maybe I can find one in the Ruby standard library or in some documentation.\n\nWait, Ruby has the `URI` module, which might have some methods for parsing URLs and emails. I should check if there's a built-in way to validate email addresses in Ruby.\n\nLet me open my Ruby interpreter and see what's available.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'uri'\n\nemail = \"test@example.com\"\nputs URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP.match?(email)\n```\n\nHmm, seems like `URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP` is a regular expression for matching email addresses. That could be useful. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNow, back to the task. I need to read a text file, each line containing an email address. So, I'll need to open the file in read mode, read each line, and store them in an array or something similar.\n\nThen, for each email address, I'll use the regular expression to check if it's valid. If it matches the pattern, I'll consider it valid and keep it; otherwise, I'll discard it.\n\nFinally, I need to write the valid email addresses to a new text file, each on a separate line.\n\nI should also think about error handling. What if the input file doesn't exist? Or what if it's empty? Or what if there are lines that are empty or have only whitespace?\n\nI need to make sure that my script can handle these scenarios gracefully, perhaps by printing an error message or skipping those entries.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any performance issues. If the input file is very large, containing millions of email addresses, my script should still perform efficiently.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the input file is of a reasonable size, say, a few thousand email addresses.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Take the input file name from the user or hardcode it for now.\n\n2. Open the input file and read all the lines into an array.\n\n3. Trim each line to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\n4. Use the regular expression to filter out invalid email addresses.\n\n5. Write the valid email addresses to a new file, one per line.\n\nI need to decide on the name of the output file. Maybe I can name it \"valid_emails.txt\" or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, I could take the output file name as a second argument from the user.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the script. Maybe I can make it accept command-line arguments for the input and output file names.\n\nIn Ruby, I can access command-line arguments using the `ARGV` array.\n\nSo, if the user runs the script like this:\n\n```\n\nruby filter_emails.rb input.txt output.txt\n\n```\n\nThen `ARGV[0]` will be \"input.txt\" and `ARGV[1]` will be \"output.txt\".\n\nI should also add some checks to make sure that the user provides both input and output file names.\n\nMoreover, I should handle cases where the input file doesn't exist or can't be read.\n\nSimilarly, I need to ensure that the output file can be written to.\n\nMaybe I can use begin-rescue blocks to handle these exceptions.\n\nLet me start writing some pseudocode.\n\n```\n\nGet input_file and output_file from ARGV\n\nBegin\n\nOpen input_file in read mode\n\nRead all lines into an array\n\nClose the file\n\nTrim each line to remove whitespace\n\nFilter the array using the email regex\n\nOpen output_file in write mode\n\nWrite each valid email address on a new line\n\nClose the file\n\nRescue\n\nHandle file not found error\n\nHandle other IO errors\n\nEnd\n\n```\n\nThat seems like a good starting point.\n\nNow, I need to find or define the email regex. As I thought earlier, I can use `URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP` from the Ruby standard library.\n\nBut just to be safe, I should look up what exactly this regex covers. I don't want to accidentally discard valid email addresses or accept invalid ones.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a more permissive or a more restrictive regex based on the requirements.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the actual regex pattern used by `URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP`.\n\nLet me check the Ruby documentation for `URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP`.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that `URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP` is defined in the `uri/mailto.rb` file in the Ruby standard library.\n\nI can take a look at its definition.\n\nLooking at the source code, it seems to be a comprehensive regex for matching email addresses according to RFC specifications.\n\nSince it's part of the standard library, it's probably a safe choice to use for validation.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with that.\n\nNow, regarding trimming the lines, I can use the `strip` method in Ruby, which removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.\n\nI should also check if a line is empty or contains only whitespace, and skip those.\n\nWait, if a line is empty or contains only whitespace, `strip` will turn it into an empty string, and the regex won't match an empty string anyway.\n\nSo, perhaps I can filter out empty strings after stripping.\n\nLet me think about edge cases.\n\n- Lines with only whitespace.\n\n- Lines with no characters.\n\n- Lines with emails that have extra spaces before or after.\n\n- Lines with comments or other text mixed with the email.\n\nAssuming that each line should contain only one email address, I'll strip the line and check if it matches the email regex.\n\nIf there are multiple emails on a single line, my current approach will treat them as a single string and likely consider them invalid.\n\nIf multiple emails per line are possible, I need to adjust my script to split the line by commas or spaces and validate each one separately.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume one email per line.\n\nAnother consideration is case sensitivity. Email local parts are case-sensitive, while domain parts are case-insensitive.\n\nBut since regex matching in Ruby is case-sensitive by default, I need to make sure that the regex handles this correctly.\n\nWait, actually, email local parts can be case-sensitive, but for the purpose of validation, perhaps I can treat the entire email as case-insensitive, since many email servers ignore case.\n\nBut to be precise, I should keep the local part case-sensitive and the domain part case-insensitive.\n\nThis might require a more complex regex or some post-processing.\n\nTo keep things simple, I'll use the `URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP` and see how it handles case sensitivity.\n\nMoving on, I need to think about how to handle encoding of the files.\n\nAssuming that the input file is in UTF-8 encoding, I should specify that when reading and writing the files.\n\nIn Ruby, I can set the encoding when opening the files.\n\nBut Ruby should handle UTF-8 by default, so perhaps it's not necessary unless there are specific encoding issues.\n\nI'll keep it simple for now.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any comments or non-email text in the file.\n\nIf the file contains lines that are not email addresses, they should be filtered out by the regex.\n\nBut if there are lines with emails and additional text, I need to make sure that only the email part is extracted and validated.\n\nThis could complicate things, so perhaps I'll assume that each line contains only an email address.\n\nIf needed, I can add more functionality to extract emails from lines containing other text.\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it simple.\n\nLet me try writing some sample code based on my outline.\n\nFirst, require the uri module to access the email regex.\n\n```ruby\n\nrequire 'uri'\n\n```\n\nThen, get the input and output file names from ARGV.\n\n```ruby\n\ninput_file = ARGV[0]\n\noutput_file = ARGV[1]\n\n```\n\nI should add some checks to make sure that both arguments are provided.\n\n```ruby\n\nif ARGV.length < 2\n\nputs \"Usage: ruby filter_emails.rb input.txt output.txt\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\n```\n\nThen, try to open the input file and read the lines.\n\n```ruby\n\nbegin\n\nemails = File.readlines(input_file, chomp: true).map { |line| line.strip }\n\nrescue Errno::ENOENT\n\nputs \"Input file not found: #{input_file}\"\n\nexit\n\nrescue StandardError => e\n\nputs \"An error occurred while reading the file: #{e.message}\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\n```\n\nHere, I'm using `readlines` with `chomp: true` to remove newline characters, and then stripping each line to remove extra whitespace.\n\nNext, filter the emails using the regex.\n\n```ruby\n\nvalid_emails = emails.select { |email| URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP.match?(email) }\n\n```\n\nThen, write the valid emails to the output file.\n\n```ruby\n\nbegin\n\nFile.open(output_file, 'w') do |file|\n\nvalid_emails.each { |email| file.puts(email) }\n\nend\n\nrescue StandardError => e\n\nputs \"An error occurred while writing to the file: #{e.message}\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\n```\n\nThat seems pretty straightforward.\n\nLet me test this code with a sample input file.\n\nSuppose I have an input file named \"emails.txt\" with the following content:\n\n```\n\ntest@example.com\n\ninvalid-email\n\nanother-test@domain.org\n\nyetanother@test.co.uk\n\n```\n\nAfter running the script with:\n\n```\n\nruby filter_emails.rb emails.txt valid_emails.txt\n\n```\n\nThe \"valid_emails.txt\" file should contain:\n\n```\n\ntest@example.com\n\nanother-test@domain.org\n\nyetanother@test.co.uk\n\n```\n\nAnd \"invalid-email\" should be filtered out.\n\nI should also test with edge cases, like empty lines, lines with only spaces, and lines with emails that have extra spaces around them.\n\nFor example, if \"emails.txt\" contains:\n\n```\n\ntest@example.com\n\n invalid-email\n\n another-test@domain.org\n\nyetanother@test.co.uk\n\n```\n\nAfter stripping, \" invalid-email\" becomes \"invalid-email\", which should still be considered invalid.\n\nSimilarly, a line with only spaces should become an empty string and be ignored.\n\nAlright, this seems to be working as expected.\n\nBut I'm wondering if there's a need to handle multiple emails per line.\n\nIf the requirement allows for multiple emails per line, separated by commas or spaces, I need to adjust the script accordingly.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it simple and assume one email per line.\n\nAnother thing to consider is performance. If the input file is very large, reading all lines into memory at once might not be efficient.\n\nIn such cases, I could read the file line by line and process each line individually, writing valid emails to the output file immediately.\n\nThis would be more memory-efficient for large files.\n\nIn Ruby, I can iterate over the file using `File.foreach` which reads the file line by line.\n\nLet me revise my code to use this approach.\n\n```ruby\n\nrequire 'uri'\n\nif ARGV.length < 2\n\nputs \"Usage: ruby filter_emails.rb input.txt output.txt\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\ninput_file = ARGV[0]\n\noutput_file = ARGV[1]\n\nbegin\n\nFile.open(output_file, 'w') do |output|\n\nFile.foreach(input_file, chomp: true) do |line|\n\nemail = line.strip\n\nif URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP.match?(email)\n\noutput.puts(email)\n\nend\n\nend\n\nend\n\nrescue Errno::ENOENT\n\nputs \"Input file not found: #{input_file}\"\n\nexit\n\nrescue StandardError => e\n\nputs \"An error occurred: #{e.message}\"\n\nexit\n\nend\n\n```\n\nThis way, I'm processing each line one at a time, which is more memory-efficient.\n\nThis should work well even for large files.\n\nI should also consider if there are any performance bottlenecks with the regex matching.\n\nBut since regex matching is generally fast, and email addresses aren't too long, it should be fine.\n\nAnother aspect is error handling. I've covered file not found and general IO errors.\n\nBut perhaps I should also check if the input file is empty.\n\nIn that case, the output file will just be empty, which is fine.\n\nI don't think I need to add extra handling for that.\n\nSimilarly, if all emails are invalid, the output file will be empty.\n\nThat's also acceptable, as long as there are no errors.\n\nI should also think about whether I need to preserve the order of the email addresses as they appear in the input file.\n\nSince I'm processing them line by line in sequence, the order should be preserved.\n\nIf there were requirements for sorting or deduplicating emails, I'd need to add accordingly.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the order should be maintained and duplicates are allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider removing duplicate email addresses.\n\nBut that might not be necessary unless specified in the requirements.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll avoid adding extra features.\n\nNow, I should think about how to run this script.\n\nI need to make sure that Ruby is installed on the system where the script will be run.\n\nI can add a shebang line at the top of the script to specify the Ruby interpreter.\n\n```ruby\n\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'uri'\n\n# rest of the code\n\n```\n\nThen, make the script executable by running:\n\n```\n\nchmod +x filter_emails.rb\n\n```\n\nThis way, it can be run directly from the command line.\n\nAdditionally, I can add some comments to the code to make it clearer for others who might read it.\n\nI should also consider writing some basic documentation or usage instructions.\n\nFor example, at the top of the script, I can include a comment explaining what the script does and how to use it.\n\n```ruby\n\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\n# This script reads a list of email addresses from an input text file,\n\n# filters out invalid email addresses using a regular expression,\n\n# and saves the valid email addresses to an output text file.\n\n#\n\n# Usage:\n\n# ruby filter_emails.rb input.txt output.txt\n\nrequire 'uri'\n\n# Rest of the code\n\n```\n\nThis helps users understand the script's purpose and how to use it correctly.\n\nI should also think about testing the script with different types of input files to ensure it handles various scenarios correctly.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A file with valid email addresses.\n\n- A file with invalid email addresses.\n\n- A file with a mix of valid and invalid email addresses.\n\n- A file with empty lines.\n\n- A file with lines containing only whitespace.\n\n- A file with emails that have extra spaces around them.\n\n- A file with emails in different cases (e.g., uppercase letters in the local part or domain).\n\nI need to make sure that the script handles all these cases correctly.\n\nAdditionally, I should verify that the output file is created successfully and contains only the valid email addresses.\n\nIf possible, I can write some test cases or use assertions to verify the correctness of the script.\n\nBut for a simple script like this, manual testing should suffice.\n\nAnother consideration is security. Since we're dealing with email addresses, which might contain sensitive information, I need to ensure that the script doesn't log or expose the email addresses unnecessarily.\n\nIn this case, the script only reads and writes files, so as long as the files are handled properly, there shouldn't be any security issues.\n\nI should also make sure that the script doesn't overwrite an existing output file without warning.\n\nBut since the output file is specified by the user, and we're opening it in write mode, it will be created anew each time the script is run.\n\nIf the user wants to append to an existing file, they would need to modify the script accordingly.\n\nBut for now, overwriting the output file is acceptable.\n\nI think I've covered most of the aspects for this task.\n\nLet me summarize the steps again:\n\n1. Require the 'uri' module to access the email regex.\n\n2. Get input and output file names from command-line arguments.\n\n3. Read the input file line by line, stripping whitespace.\n\n4. Use the regex to filter valid email addresses.\n\n5. Write the valid email addresses to the output file, one per line.\n\n6. Handle exceptions for file operations and provide user feedback.\n\nI should save this script with a meaningful name, like \"filter_emails.rb\", and make sure it's well-documented.\n\nFinally, I can run the script with sample input and output files to verify that it works as expected.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Ruby script that reads a list of email addresses from a text file, filters out invalid email addresses using regular expression matching, and saves the valid email addresses to a new text file.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading Input:** The script reads email addresses from an input text file, with one email per line.\n2. **Validation:** It uses a regular expression from Ruby's `URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP` to validate each email address.\n3. **Writing Output:** Valid email addresses are written to a new text file, one per line.\n4. **Error Handling:** The script handles file not found errors and other I/O errors gracefully.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```ruby\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\n# This script reads a list of email addresses from an input text file,\n# filters out invalid email addresses using a regular expression,\n# and saves the valid email addresses to an output text file.\n#\n# Usage:\n# ruby filter_emails.rb input.txt output.txt\n\nrequire 'uri'\n\nif ARGV.length < 2\n  puts \"Usage: ruby filter_emails.rb input.txt output.txt\"\n  exit\nend\n\ninput_file = ARGV[0]\noutput_file = ARGV[1]\n\nbegin\n  File.open(output_file, 'w') do |output|\n    File.foreach(input_file, chomp: true) do |line|\n      email = line.strip\n      if URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP.match?(email)\n        output.puts(email)\n      end\n    end\n  end\nrescue Errno::ENOENT\n  puts \"Input file not found: #{input_file}\"\n  exit\nrescue StandardError => e\n  puts \"An error occurred: #{e.message}\"\n  exit\nend\n\nputs \"Valid emails have been saved to #{output_file}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading Command-Line Arguments:** The input and output file names are retrieved from the command-line arguments.\n2. **Reading and Processing Emails:** The script reads each line from the input file, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and checks if it matches the email regex.\n3. **Writing Valid Emails:** Valid emails are written to the output file, one per line.\n4. **Error Handling:** The script catches exceptions for missing input files and other I/O errors, providing user feedback.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient handling of large files by processing one line at a time and maintains clarity and simplicity in implementation."
