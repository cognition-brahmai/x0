Each plan will have an associated evidence value which is the output of one of the functions given an input string that can be the user's query, previous evidence values or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can call:\nSearchEngine[input]: A tool that allows users to search for information using a generic search engine. This tool helps in finding relevant sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Load websites from the input string containing newline separated links. The input is one or more links and produces plain text output with the content of the links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text response of links separated by newlines.\nQAModel[input]: Question answering model useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe function input should be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAModel[What is the capital of France, given :evidence1:?]\n\nInclude only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, referencing previous evidence if necessary]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some major accomplishments of Elon Musk?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out about some major accomplishments of Elon Musk. I think the best way to start is by searching for information about him online. I can use the SearchEngine tool for that. So, my first plan is to search for \"Elon Musk accomplishments.\"\n\nPlan: Search for information about Elon Musk's accomplishments.\n:evidence0: = SearchEngine[Elon Musk accomplishments]\n\nNow, once I have the search results, I need to look through them to find relevant websites that talk about his major achievements. I might need to extract specific links from these search results to get detailed information. So, my next plan is to use the LinkExtractor tool on the search results to get a list of relevant links.\n\nPlan: Extract links from the search results.\n:evidence1: = LinkExtractor[:evidence0:]\n\nWith these links, I can then use the WebScraper tool to extract information from these websites. This should give me a bunch of text that I can read through to find the accomplishments.\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from the extracted links.\n:evidence2: = WebScraper[:evidence1:]\n\nNow, with all this text, I need to find the specific accomplishments of Elon Musk. It might be too much information to go through manually, so I can use the QAModel tool to ask a question based on the text I've scraped. I'll ask something like, \"What are some major accomplishments of Elon Musk?\" and reference the scraped text as evidence.\n\nPlan: Use the QAModel to find accomplishments based on the scraped text.\n:evidence3: = QAModel[What are some major accomplishments of Elon Musk, given :evidence2:?]\n\nFinally, I should have an answer with some major accomplishments of Elon Musk. I can review this answer to make sure it makes sense and includes well-known achievements.\n\nAnswer: :evidence3:\n\n## Final Solution\nTo answer the question about Elon Musk's major accomplishments, the following step-by-step plan utilizing available tools is proposed:\n\n1. **Search for Information:**\n   - Use the `SearchEngine` tool to find relevant information about Elon Musk's accomplishments.\n   - **Evidence:** `:evidence0: = SearchEngine[Elon Musk accomplishments]`\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Links:**\n   - Utilize the `LinkExtractor` tool to extract links from the search results for further investigation.\n   - **Evidence:** `:evidence1: = LinkExtractor[:evidence0:]`\n\n3. **Scrape Website Content:**\n   - Employ the `WebScraper` tool to extract text from the links obtained in the previous step.\n   - **Evidence:** `:evidence2: = WebScraper[:evidence1:]`\n\n4. **Extract Accomplishments:**\n   - Use the `QAModel` tool to analyze the scraped text and identify major accomplishments of Elon Musk.\n   - **Evidence:** `:evidence3: = QAModel[What are some major accomplishments of Elon Musk, given :evidence2:?]`\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer will be contained in `:evidence3:`, which should list some of Elon Musk's major accomplishments based on the information gathered and processed through the above steps.\n   - **Answer:** `:evidence3:`"
