        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem. So, we've got 12 black socks and 8 white socks in a drawer, making a total of 20 socks. The question is, if you pick three socks at random without looking, what's the probability that you'll have at least one pair of matching socks?\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"at least one pair of matching socks\" means. It means that among the three socks I pick, at least two of them are the same color. So, it could be two black and one white, two white and one black, or all three being the same color.\n\nNow, when I see \"at least one pair,\" it often reminds me that it might be easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be picking three socks with no pairs, meaning all three socks are of different colors. But wait, since there are only two colors, it's impossible to have three socks all of different colors. So, the complementary event in this case wouldn't make sense because you can't have three socks without at least one pair when there are only two colors.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider the total number of ways to pick three socks out of 20. That's simply the combination of 20 socks taken 3 at a time, which is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{20}{3} = \\frac{20!}{3!(20-3)!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 1140\n\\]\n\nOkay, so there are 1,140 possible ways to pick any three socks from the drawer.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to pick three socks such that there's at least one pair of matching socks. As I thought earlier, this could be:\n\n1. Two black and one white\n\n2. Two white and one black\n\n3. Three black\n\n4. Three white\n\nWait a minute, actually, for \"at least one pair,\" having three of the same color would still satisfy the condition of having at least one pair. So, I should consider all these scenarios.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Since it's impossible to pick three socks without having at least one pair when there are only two colors, because if you pick two of one color and one of another, or all three of the same color, in either case, you have at least one pair.\n\nSo, in this specific case, no matter which three socks you pick, you will always have at least one pair of matching socks.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1, or 100%.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. If I pick three socks, the only way to not have at least one pair would be if I pick one black and one white and then another color, but since there are only two colors, that's not possible. So yes, every possible selection of three socks will include at least one pair of the same color.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1, or 100%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
