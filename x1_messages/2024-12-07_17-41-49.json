        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a bacteria colony that doubles its population every hour. I need to figure out how many bacteria there will be after 36 hours, and the initial population is 50. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the colony doubles every hour. That sounds like exponential growth, right? Exponential growth means the population increases by a constant factor at regular time intervals. In this case, the factor is 2, and the time interval is 1 hour.\n\nSo, the general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times r^{t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P(t) \\) is the population at time \\( t \\),\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate (the factor by which the population multiplies at each time period),\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time elapsed.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( P_0 = 50 \\),\n\n- \\( r = 2 \\) (since it doubles),\n\n- \\( t = 36 \\) hours.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ P(36) = 50 \\times 2^{36} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 2^{36} \\). That's 2 multiplied by itself 36 times. Let me see:\n\n\\[ 2^1 = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^5 = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{10} = 1024 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = 1024^2 = 1,048,576 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{30} = (2^{10})^3 = 1024^3 = 1,073,741,824 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{36} = 2^{30} \\times 2^{6} = 1,073,741,824 \\times 64 \\]\n\nWait, that might be a bit tedious to calculate manually. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I know that \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\), which is roughly \\( 10^3 \\), so \\( 2^{30} \\) is about \\( (10^3)^3 = 10^9 \\), and \\( 2^{36} \\) would be \\( 2^{30} \\times 2^{6} = 10^9 \\times 64 = 64 \\times 10^9 \\), which is 64,000,000,000.\n\nBut let's be more precise. Let me calculate \\( 2^{36} \\) step by step:\n\n\\[ 2^{36} = 64 \\times 2^{30} \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{30} = 1,073,741,824 \\]\n\n\\[ 64 \\times 1,073,741,824 = 64 \\times 1,073,741,824 = 68,719,476,736 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 2^{36} = 68,719,476,736 \\)\n\nNow, multiply that by the initial population of 50:\n\n\\[ P(36) = 50 \\times 68,719,476,736 = 3,435,973,836,800 \\]\n\nThat's 3.4359738368 trillion bacteria after 36 hours.\n\nWait a minute, that seems incredibly large. Is there a possibility I made a mistake in my calculations?\n\nLet me double-check \\( 2^{36} \\):\n\n\\[ 2^{10} = 1024 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{20} = 1024^2 = 1,048,576 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{30} = 1024^3 = 1,073,741,824 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{36} = 2^{30} \\times 2^{6} = 1,073,741,824 \\times 64 = 68,719,476,736 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, multiplying by 50:\n\n\\[ 50 \\times 68,719,476,736 = 3,435,973,836,800 \\]\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, after 36 hours, there would be 3,435,973,836,800 bacteria.\n\nBut, realistically, is that possible? I mean, such rapid exponential growth seems unsustainable in real-world conditions. There must be limitations like space and nutrient availability, right? In real life, bacterial growth doesn't continue exponentially forever; it eventually levels off due to resource limitations or other constraints.\n\nHowever, since this is a theoretical problem, I'll assume that there are no such limitations and that the bacteria can keep doubling every hour for 36 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the way I applied the formula. Let me think again.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that every hour the population doubles. So, starting with 50 bacteria:\n\nAfter 1 hour: 50 \u00d7 2 = 100\n\nAfter 2 hours: 100 \u00d7 2 = 200\n\nAfter 3 hours: 200 \u00d7 2 = 400\n\n...\n\nAfter 36 hours: 50 \u00d7 2^{36}\n\nWhich is the same as what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use logarithms to check this, but that might not be necessary since the exponential formula seems appropriate here.\n\nWait, maybe I can calculate it using Python or a calculator to verify.\n\nLet me pull out my calculator.\n\nCalculating 2^36:\n\n2^36 = 68,719,476,736\n\nThen, 50 \u00d7 68,719,476,736 = 3,435,973,836,800\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3,435,973,836,800 bacteria after 36 hours.\n\nBut to make it more understandable, I can express it in scientific notation.\n\n3,435,973,836,800 = 3.4359738368 \u00d7 10^12\n\nAlternatively, in terms of millions or billions.\n\n3,435,973,836,800 is 3.4359738368 trillion.\n\nSo, approximately 3.44 trillion bacteria.\n\nBut since we're dealing with whole bacteria, we should probably keep it as an integer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3,435,973,836,800 bacteria.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3435973836800} \\]"
