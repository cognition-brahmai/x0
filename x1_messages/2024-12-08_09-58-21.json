        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. You're drawing two balls at random without replacement, and you want to know the probability of drawing one ball of each color. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once you draw the first ball, you don't put it back into the bag before drawing the second ball. So, the total number of balls decreases by one after the first draw.\n\nNow, to find the probability of drawing one ball of each color, I can think of it in two scenarios:\n\n1. Drawing a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\n2. Drawing a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\nI need to find the probabilities of these two scenarios and then add them together because they are mutually exclusive events.\n\nLet's start with the first scenario: drawing a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/8.\n\nAfter drawing a red ball, there are now 7 balls left in the bag, with 4 red balls and 3 blue balls.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a blue ball second is 3/7.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening in sequence (first red, then blue) is (5/8) * (3/7).\n\nNow, for the second scenario: drawing a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue ball first is 3/8.\n\nAfter drawing a blue ball, there are now 7 balls left in the bag, with 5 red balls and 2 blue balls.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red ball second is 5/7.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening in sequence (first blue, then red) is (3/8) * (5/7).\n\nNow, I need to add these two probabilities together to get the total probability of drawing one ball of each color.\n\nSo, total probability = (5/8 * 3/7) + (3/8 * 5/7)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 5/8 * 3/7 = 15/56\n\nSecond, 3/8 * 5/7 = 15/56\n\nAdding them together: 15/56 + 15/56 = 30/56\n\nSimplifying 30/56, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 15/28\n\nSo, the probability is 15/28.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using combinations?\n\nYes, I can use combinations to find the probability.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 8 is C(8,2), which is 28.\n\nThe number of ways to draw one red and one blue ball is C(5,1) * C(3,1), which is 5 * 3 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 15/28.\n\nThat matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing one ball of each color is 15/28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{28}} \\]"
