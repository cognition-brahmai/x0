I need to find out how many minutes there are in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many minutes are in one day. Since there are 24 hours in a day and each hour has 60 minutes, I can multiply 24 by 60 to get the minutes in a day.\n\nSo, 24 hours/day \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 1,440 minutes/day.\n\nNow, there are 7 days in a week, so to find out the total minutes in a week, I need to multiply the minutes in one day by 7.\n\nThat would be 1,440 minutes/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 10,080 minutes/week.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way could be to think about the total hours in a week first. There are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, so 24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 168 hours/week.\n\nThen, since each hour has 60 minutes, I can multiply 168 hours/week by 60 minutes/hour to get the total minutes in a week.\n\nSo, 168 hours/week \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 10,080 minutes/week.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is 10,080 minutes in a week.\n\nI think that makes sense. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or if this is always the case.\n\nA week is generally defined as 7 days, and each day has 24 hours, with each hour having 60 minutes. So, this should be consistent unless there are some special circumstances, like daylight saving time adjustments, but in general, those don't affect the total number of minutes in a week.\n\nSo, I can confidently say that there are 10,080 minutes in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10080} \\]"
