Here are four common wood carving techniques along with examples of when they might be used:\n\n1. **Whittling:**\n   - **Description:** Whittling is one of the simplest and most accessible wood carving techniques. It involves using a knife to shape wood by removing small shavings or slices. This technique is often done freehand and is great for creating small, detailed pieces.\n   - **Example Use:** Whittling is perfect for carving small figurines, such as animals or\u4eba\u7269, or for creating intricate designs on handles or ornaments. For instance, carving a simple wooden keychain or a mini figurine of a bird would be ideal for this technique.\n\n2. **Chip Carving:**\n   - **Description:** Chip carving is a decorative technique where small, precise chips of wood are removed using a knife or a chisel. This creates geometric patterns and designs on the surface of the wood.\n   - **Example Use:** This technique is often used in furniture making to add decorative elements to cabinets, boxes, or table tops. For example, carving a geometric pattern on a wooden box lid or adding floral designs to a wooden tray.\n\n3. **Relief Carving:**\n   - **Description:** Relief carving involves carving designs that protrude from a flat background. The depth of the carving can vary, from shallow to deep, depending on the desired effect. This technique is commonly used in sculptures and panel decorations.\n   - **Example Use:** Relief carving is excellent for creating wall hangings, plaques, or decorative panels. For instance, carving a scenes or portraits on a wooden panel to be hung on a wall or creating a decorative border around a mirror frame.\n\n4. **Sculptural Carving:**\n   - **Description:** Sculptural carving is a more advanced technique that involves carving a three-dimensional form from a block of wood. This can range from realistic figures to abstract shapes, requiring a higher level of skill and often using a variety of tools.\n   - **Example Use:** This technique is used for creating statues, figurines, or other three-dimensional artworks. For example, carving a detailed sculpture of a human figure or an abstract piece for a garden or indoor display.\n\nEach of these techniques offers unique possibilities for creativity and expression in wood carving. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced carver, there's a technique suited to your skill level and artistic vision."
