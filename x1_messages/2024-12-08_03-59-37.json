        "content": "So there are 5 cats in a room, and each cat catches 4 mice in an hour. But once a mouse is caught, it can't be caught again by another cat. We need to find out how many mice all the cats will catch in total after 3 hours.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many mice one cat can catch in one hour. According to the problem, each cat catches 4 mice per hour. So, in one hour, one cat catches 4 mice.\n\nNow, since there are 5 cats, in one hour, all the cats together would catch 5 times 4, which is 20 mice.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the total number of mice caught after 3 hours. So, if in one hour they catch 20 mice, then in 3 hours, it would be 3 times 20, which is 60 mice.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the condition that once a mouse is caught, it can't be caught again by another cat. But in this scenario, since each cat is catching its own mice and not interfering with each other's catches, this condition doesn't change the total number of mice caught.\n\nSo, the total number of mice caught by all the cats after 3 hours is 60.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I need to think about it differently. Maybe the number of mice available is limited, and after some mice are caught, there are fewer left for the cats to catch in subsequent hours.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify how many mice are available in total. If there are only a certain number of mice in the room, and cats are catching them, then after a certain point, there might be no mice left to catch.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give any information about the total number of mice available. It only says that each cat catches 4 mice per hour, and once caught, a mouse can't be caught again.\n\nIf we assume that there are enough mice for all cats to catch 4 mice each hour for 3 hours, then the total would be 5 cats times 4 mice per hour times 3 hours, which is 60 mice.\n\nAlternatively, if there are fewer mice than that, then the total number caught would be limited by the available mice.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the total number of mice available, I think we have to assume that there are enough mice for the cats to catch 4 each per hour for 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total number of mice caught is 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
