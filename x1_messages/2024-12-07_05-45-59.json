        "content": "Designing a Java-based chat server and client application using sockets involves several steps. We'll create a simple chat system where multiple clients can connect to a server, choose nicknames, and send messages that are broadcast to all other connected clients.\n\n### Overview\n\n1. **Server Side:**\n   - Create a server that listens for incoming client connections.\n   - Handle multiple clients concurrently using threads.\n   - Broadcast messages from one client to all other connected clients.\n\n2. **Client Side:**\n   - Allow users to enter their nickname.\n   - Send messages to the server.\n   - Receive and display messages from the server.\n\n### Server Implementation\n\n#### Server Class\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ChatServer {\n    private static final int PORT = 12345;\n    private static List<ClientHandler> clients = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Server started on port \" + PORT);\n\n        while (true) {\n            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n            ClientHandler client = new ClientHandler(socket);\n            clients.add(client);\n            new Thread(client).start();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void broadcastMessage(String message, ClientHandler excludeClient) {\n        for (ClientHandler client : clients) {\n            if (client != excludeClient) {\n                client.sendMessage(message);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {\n        private Socket socket;\n        private PrintWriter out;\n        private String nickname;\n\n        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {\n            this.socket = socket;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            try {\n                InputStream input = socket.getInputStream();\n                BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input));\n                out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n                // Get nickname from client\n                nickname = reader.readLine();\n                if (nickname == null || nickname.isEmpty()) {\n                    nickname = \"Anonymous\";\n                }\n                System.out.println(nickname + \" connected.\");\n\n                String message;\n                while ((message = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(nickname + \": \" + message);\n                    broadcastMessage(nickname + \": \" + message, this);\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            } finally {\n                clients.remove(this);\n                socket.close();\n                System.out.println(nickname + \" disconnected.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void sendMessage(String message) {\n            out.println(message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Client Implementation\n\n#### Client Class\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class ChatClient {\n    private static final String SERVER_ADDRESS = \"localhost\";\n    private static final int SERVER_PORT = 12345;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        Socket socket = new Socket(SERVER_ADDRESS, SERVER_PORT);\n        System.out.println(\"Connected to server\");\n\n        // Get nickname from user\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter your nickname: \");\n        String nickname = scanner.nextLine();\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\n        out.println(nickname);\n\n        // Start a thread to read messages from server\n        new Thread(() -> {\n            try {\n                BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n                String message;\n                while ((message = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                    System.out.println(message);\n                }\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }).start();\n\n        // Send messages to server\n        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n            String message = scanner.nextLine();\n            out.println(message);\n        }\n\n        socket.close();\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Server Side:**\n   - The `ChatServer` class sets up a server socket and listens for incoming connections.\n   - For each client connection, a new `ClientHandler` thread is created to handle communication with that client.\n   - The `ClientHandler` reads the client's nickname and then reads messages from the client. Each message is broadcast to all other connected clients using the `broadcastMessage` method.\n\n2. **Client Side:**\n   - The `ChatClient` class connects to the server and prompts the user to enter a nickname, which is sent to the server.\n   - A separate thread is started to read messages from the server and print them to the console.\n   - The main thread reads user input and sends messages to the server.\n\nThis basic implementation provides a foundation for a multi-client chat system. You can extend it with additional features like private messaging, user list, and better error handling."
