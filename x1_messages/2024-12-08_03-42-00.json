Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a mixture of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the Bing search engine. This tool is useful in finding an appropriate list of sites that may or may not include the answer to the user's question.\nTextParser[input]: Extracts relevant information from plain text and produces a concise summary.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nSAM[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are some notable achievements of Marie Curie?"
