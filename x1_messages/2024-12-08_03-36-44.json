        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Python program that connects to a REST API, retrieves JSON data, parses it, and prints specific information based on user input. Sounds like a fun project!\n\nFirst things first, we need to make sure we have all the necessary tools. Since we're dealing with APIs and JSON data, we'll need to use the `requests` library in Python. Don't worry if you don't have it installed; it's pretty straightforward.\n\n### Step 1: Install the Requests Library\n\nOpen your terminal or command prompt and type:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\nThis command installs the `requests` library, which makes it easy to send HTTP requests and handle the responses.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a REST API\n\nFor this example, let's use the JSONPlaceholder API, which is a free API for testing and prototyping. It provides fake data for users, posts, comments, etc. You can check it out at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.\n\n### Step 3: Connect to the API and Retrieve Data\n\nWe'll write a function to connect to the API and fetch the data. Let's say we want to retrieve a list of users.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_users():\n    url = \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        return response.json()\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve data.\")\n        return None\n```\n\nThis function sends a GET request to the users endpoint and returns the JSON data if the request is successful.\n\n### Step 4: Parse the JSON Data\n\nOnce we have the data, we need to parse it to extract the information we need. For example, let's say we want to list all users and their IDs.\n\n```python\ndef list_users(users):\n    for user in users:\n        print(f\"ID: {user['id']}, Name: {user['name']}\")\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the list of users and prints each user's ID and name.\n\n### Step 5: Get User Input\n\nNow, let's allow the user to input a user ID, and we'll display more details about that specific user.\n\n```python\ndef get_user_details(users, user_id):\n    for user in users:\n        if user['id'] == user_id:\n            print(f\"User Details:\")\n            print(f\"ID: {user['id']}\")\n            print(f\"Name: {user['name']}\")\n            print(f\"Username: {user['username']}\")\n            print(f\"Email: {user['email']}\")\n            print(f\"Address: {user['address']['street']}, {user['address']['suite']}, {user['address']['city']}\")\n            print(f\"Phone: {user['phone']}\")\n            print(f\"Website: {user['website']}\")\n            print(f\"Company: {user['company']['name']}\")\n            return\n    print(\"User not found.\")\n```\n\nThis function searches for the user with the given ID and prints their details.\n\n### Step 6: Put It All Together\n\nNow, let's combine all these functions into a complete program.\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_users():\n    url = \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        return response.json()\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve data.\")\n        return None\n\ndef list_users(users):\n    for user in users:\n        print(f\"ID: {user['id']}, Name: {user['name']}\")\n\ndef get_user_details(users, user_id):\n    for user in users:\n        if user['id'] == user_id:\n            print(f\"User Details:\")\n            print(f\"ID: {user['id']}\")\n            print(f\"Name: {user['name']}\")\n            print(f\"Username: {user['username']}\")\n            print(f\"Email: {user['email']}\")\n            print(f\"Address: {user['address']['street']}, {user['address']['suite']}, {user['address']['city']}\")\n            print(f\"Phone: {user['phone']}\")\n            print(f\"Website: {user['website']}\")\n            print(f\"Company: {user['company']['name']}\")\n            return\n    print(\"User not found.\")\n\ndef main():\n    users = get_users()\n    if users:\n        print(\"List of users:\")\n        list_users(users)\n        \n        user_id = int(input(\"Enter a user ID to view details: \"))\n        get_user_details(users, user_id)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Get Users:** Fetches the list of users from the API.\n2. **List Users:** Prints a list of user IDs and names.\n3. **Get User Details:** Retrieves and prints detailed information for a specific user based on the ID input by the user.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave the code to a Python file, for example, `api_client.py`, and run it using Python:\n\n```bash\npython api_client.py\n```\n\nYou should see a list of users, and then you can enter a user ID to see more details about that user.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple Python program that connects to a REST API, retrieves JSON data, parses it, and interacts with the user based on their input.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
