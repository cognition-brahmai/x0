        "content": "So there are 400 students in total at this school. Out of these, 25% play soccer and 15% play basketball. I need to find out how many students don't participate in either sport.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students play soccer. Since 25% of the students play soccer, I can calculate that by taking 25% of 400.\n\n25% of 400 is (25/100) * 400 = 0.25 * 400 = 100 students.\n\nSimilarly, 15% play basketball, so that's (15/100) * 400 = 0.15 * 400 = 60 students.\n\nNow, if I add the number of students who play soccer and basketball, that's 100 + 60 = 160 students.\n\nBut wait, maybe some students play both sports. If that's the case, then adding 100 and 60 would count those students twice, which isn't correct.\n\nSo, I need to know if there are students who play both sports. The problem doesn't mention anything about students playing both sports, so maybe I can assume that the groups are distinct.\n\nHowever, in general, when dealing with percentages like this, it's possible that there is an overlap.\n\nLet me check if the problem provides any information about students playing both sports. It doesn't. So, perhaps I should assume that the groups are mutually exclusive, meaning no student plays both sports.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total number of students who play either soccer or basketball is 100 + 60 = 160.\n\nThen, the number of students who don't participate in either sport would be the total number of students minus those who play soccer or basketball.\n\nSo, 400 - 160 = 240 students.\n\nBut, what if there are students who play both sports? How would that affect the calculation?\n\nIf some students play both sports, then the total number of students who play either sport would be less than 160 because those who play both would have been counted twice in the addition of 100 and 60.\n\nTo account for that, I would need to subtract the number of students who play both sports from the total of 160.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of students who play both sports as x.\n\nThen, the total number of students who play either soccer or basketball would be 100 + 60 - x.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who don't play either sport would be 400 - (100 + 60 - x) = 400 - 160 + x = 240 + x.\n\nBut since I don't know the value of x, I can't calculate the exact number.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem assumes that there are no students who play both sports, meaning x = 0.\n\nIn that case, the number of students who don't play either sport would be 240.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me think about percentages.\n\nTotal students = 400.\n\nPercentage playing soccer = 25%.\n\nPercentage playing basketball = 15%.\n\nIf no student plays both sports, then the percentage of students who play either sport is 25% + 15% = 40%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of students who don't play either sport is 100% - 40% = 60%.\n\nSo, 60% of 400 students don't play either sport.\n\n60% of 400 is (60/100) * 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240 students.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nBut again, this assumes that no student plays both sports.\n\nIf some students play both sports, then the percentage playing either sport would be less than 40%, and the percentage not playing either sport would be more than 60%.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide information about students playing both sports, perhaps it's safe to assume that there is no overlap, and the answer is 240 students.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that some students might play both sports.\n\nIn that case, I would need more information to find the exact number.\n\nBut since no such information is provided, perhaps the answer is indeed 240 students.\n\nLet me consider another approach using sets.\n\nLet S be the set of students playing soccer, and B be the set of students playing basketball.\n\nWe are given:\n\nTotal students = 400.\n\nn(S) = 25% of 400 = 100.\n\nn(B) = 15% of 400 = 60.\n\nWe need to find the number of students who do not play either sport, which is the number of students not in S or B, i.e., n(S \u222a B)'.\n\nFrom set theory, n(S \u222a B) = n(S) + n(B) - n(S \u2229 B).\n\nThen, n(S \u222a B)' = total students - n(S \u222a B) = 400 - (100 + 60 - n(S \u2229 B)) = 400 - 160 + n(S \u2229 B) = 240 + n(S \u2229 B).\n\nAgain, without knowing n(S \u2229 B), I can't find the exact value of n(S \u222a B)'.\n\nUnless, as I thought earlier, the problem assumes that n(S \u2229 B) = 0, meaning no student plays both sports.\n\nIn that case, n(S \u222a B)' = 240 + 0 = 240 students.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the percentages given are exclusive, meaning no overlap, which would lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who do not participate in either sport is 240.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]\n"
