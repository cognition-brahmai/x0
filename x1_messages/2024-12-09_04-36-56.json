        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're told that in a town, one-third of the population are vegetarians. Among these vegetarians, two-fifths are men, and there are 60 vegetarian men in the town. We need to find the total population of the town.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given:\n\n1. Vegetarians make up 1/3 of the total population.\n\n2. Among vegetarians, 2/5 are men.\n\n3. There are 60 vegetarian men.\n\nWe need to find the total population.\n\nLet's denote the total population of the town as P.\n\nAccording to the first piece of information, the number of vegetarians is (1/3)P.\n\nNow, among these vegetarians, 2/5 are men. So, the number of vegetarian men is (2/5) times the number of vegetarians.\n\nSo, number of vegetarian men = (2/5) * (1/3)P.\n\nWe're told that this number is 60.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n(2/5) * (1/3)P = 60\n\nNow, let's solve for P.\n\nFirst, multiply the fractions on the left side:\n\n(2/5) * (1/3) = (2*1)/(5*3) = 2/15\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(2/15)P = 60\n\nTo find P, we need to isolate P on one side.\n\nWe can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/15, which is 15/2.\n\nSo, P = 60 * (15/2)\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 60 divided by 2 is 30.\n\nThen, 30 multiplied by 15 is 450.\n\nTherefore, P = 450\n\nSo, the total population of the town is 450.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nNumber of vegetarians = (1/3)P\n\nNumber of vegetarian men = (2/5) * (1/3)P = (2/15)P\n\nGiven that (2/15)P = 60\n\nSo, P = 60 * (15/2) = 60 * 7.5 = 450\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can verify by plugging the value back into the original conditions.\n\nIf total population P = 450\n\nThen, number of vegetarians = (1/3)*450 = 150\n\nNumber of vegetarian men = (2/5)*150 = 60\n\nWhich matches the given information.\n\nTherefore, the total population of the town is indeed 450.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]"
