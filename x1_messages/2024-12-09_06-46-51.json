        "content": "Sure! The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to any given limit. I'll walk you through how it works and then provide a Python function to implement it.\n\n### How the Sieve of Eratosthenes Works\n\n1. **Initialization**: Create a list of boolean values representing numbers from 0 to n. Initially, set all entries to `True` (indicating that all numbers are potentially prime), except for 0 and 1, which are not prime.\n2. **Sieve Process**: Starting from the first prime number, which is 2, mark all multiples of each prime number as not prime (i.e., set their corresponding entries in the list to `False`).\n3. **Iteration**: Continue this process for all numbers up to the square root of n, since any non-prime number greater than the square root of n will have a factor less than or equal to the square root.\n4. **Collection**: Finally, collect all numbers that are still marked as `True` in the list; these are the prime numbers.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nHere's a Python function that implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes:\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):\n    if limit < 2:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize a list of boolean values\n    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers\n    \n    # Sieve process\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= limit:\n        if is_prime[p]:\n            for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):\n                is_prime[i] = False\n        p += 1\n    \n    # Collect all prime numbers\n    primes = [num for num, prime in enumerate(is_prime) if prime]\n    return primes\n\n# Example usage:\nlimit = 30\nprint(f\"Prime numbers up to {limit}: {sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We create a list `is_prime` of size `limit + 1` and initialize all entries to `True`, except for indices 0 and 1, which are set to `False`.\n\n2. **Sieve Process**:\n   - We start with the first prime number, 2, and mark all its multiples as not prime.\n   - We then move to the next unmarked number and repeat the process, continuing until we've processed all numbers up to the square root of the limit.\n\n3. **Collection**:\n   - We collect all indices that are still marked as `True` in the `is_prime` list, which represent the prime numbers up to the given limit.\n\nThis function efficiently finds all prime numbers up to any given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm."
