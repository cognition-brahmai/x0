        "content": "If a car is moving at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, to find out how far it will travel in 2.5 hours, you can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nGiven that the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 2.5 hours, you can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 150 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nSo, the car will travel 150 miles in 2.5 hours at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Units Consistency:** It's important to ensure that the units for speed and time are compatible. In this case, since speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, the result is in miles, which is consistent.\n\n- **Average Speed:** Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. In this problem, it's given as 60 miles per hour, meaning that on average, the car covers 60 miles every hour.\n\n- **Real-World Considerations:** In real-world scenarios, average speed can be affected by various factors such as traffic, road conditions, speed limits, and rest stops. However, for this calculation, we assume a constant average speed.\n\n- **Conversion to Other Units:** If needed, the distance can be converted to other units. For example, to convert miles to kilometers, you can use the conversion factor where 1 mile is approximately 1.60934 kilometers.\n\n\\[ 150 \\, \\text{miles} \\times 1.60934 \\, \\frac{\\text{kilometers}}{\\text{mile}} \\approx 241.401 \\, \\text{kilometers} \\]\n\nSo, 150 miles is approximately 241.4 kilometers.\n\n- **Time in Different Formats:** Sometimes, time might be given in minutes or seconds. It's crucial to convert the time to hours if the speed is in miles per hour. For example, 2 hours and 30 minutes is 2.5 hours.\n\n- **Speed Calculations:** If you know the distance and the time, you can also calculate the speed using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\]\n\n- **Distance Calculations:** Similarly, if you know the speed and the time, you can find the distance, as done in this problem.\n\n- **Time Calculations:** If you know the distance and the speed, you can find the time using:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nThese formulas are fundamental in solving problems related to motion and can be applied in various scenarios involving constant speed or average speed.\n\n**Example of a Related Problem:**\n\nIf a train travels 300 miles in 5 hours, what is its average speed?\n\nUsing the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{300 \\, \\text{miles}}{5 \\, \\text{hours}} = 60 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\]\n\nSo, the train's average speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Another Example:**\n\nIf a cyclist rides at an average speed of 15 miles per hour, how long will it take to cover 75 miles?\n\nUsing the formula for time:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{75 \\, \\text{miles}}{15 \\, \\text{miles per hour}} = 5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the cyclist 5 hours to cover 75 miles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between distance, speed, and time is essential for solving problems related to motion. By using the basic formulas and ensuring that units are consistent, you can easily calculate any of these variables when the other two are known."
