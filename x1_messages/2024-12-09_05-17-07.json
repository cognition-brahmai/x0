        "content": "Sure! Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation is:\n\n4x - 7 = 15\n\nFirst, we want to isolate the term with the variable x. To do that, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -7 on the left side.\n\nSo, adding 7 to both sides:\n\n4x - 7 + 7 = 15 + 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n4x = 22\n\nNow, to solve for x, we need to divide both sides by 4.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 4:\n\n4x / 4 = 22 / 4\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 5.5\n\nTherefore, the solution is x = 5.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.5} \\]"
