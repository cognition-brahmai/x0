        "content": "Let's see. So, in this village, there are 50 houses, and each house has one dog. So, that means there are 50 dogs in total, right? And normally, each dog has 4 legs. But some of these dogs have lost one leg due to accidents, so they only have 3 legs now. The total number of legs in the village is 192. I need to find out how many dogs have lost one leg.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many legs there would be if none of the dogs had lost a leg. That would be 50 dogs times 4 legs each, which is 200 legs. But since some dogs have lost a leg, the total is 192 legs. So, there are 200 - 192 = 8 legs missing.\n\nEach dog that has lost a leg is missing one leg. So, if 8 legs are missing in total, that means 8 dogs have lost one leg each.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I should set up an equation. Let's say x is the number of dogs that have lost one leg. Then, the number of dogs with all 4 legs is 50 - x.\n\nThe total number of legs would be:\n\n(50 - x) * 4 + x * 3 = 192\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\n200 - 4x + 3x = 192\n\n200 - x = 192\n\n-x = 192 - 200\n\n-x = -8\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, x = 8, which matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nJust to double-check, if 8 dogs have lost one leg, they each have 3 legs, and the remaining 42 dogs have 4 legs each.\n\nSo, 42 * 4 = 168 legs, and 8 * 3 = 24 legs.\n\nTotal legs: 168 + 24 = 192, which matches the given total.\n\nTherefore, the number of dogs that have lost one leg is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
