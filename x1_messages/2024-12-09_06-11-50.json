Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, and it's primarily caused by human activities that increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Desert areas can experience rainfall due to various weather phenomena, but these events don't negate the overall trends of climate change. It's essential to consider the bigger picture and the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change."
