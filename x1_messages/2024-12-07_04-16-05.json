This historic event took place on May 11, 1997, in New York City. The match was a six-game series, and Deep Blue won with two wins and three draws, as chess matches typically require a majority of wins to determine the winner. This victory marked a significant milestone in the development of artificial intelligence and computer technology, demonstrating that machines could surpass human capabilities in complex strategic games like chess."
