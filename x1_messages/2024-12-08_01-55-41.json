First, we need to find out how much the customer spends on each type of candy and then add those amounts together.\n\nStarting with type X candies:\n- Each piece costs $2.\n- The customer buys 10 pieces.\n\nSo, the total cost for type X is:\n10 pieces * $2 per piece = $20.\n\nNext, type Y candies:\n- Each piece costs $3.\n- The customer buys 8 pieces.\n\nTotal cost for type Y is:\n8 pieces * $3 per piece = $24.\n\nNow, type Z candies:\n- Each piece costs $5.\n- The customer buys 6 pieces.\n\nTotal cost for type Z is:\n6 pieces * $5 per piece = $30.\n\nFinally, we add up the costs for all three types:\n$20 (type X) + $24 (type Y) + $30 (type Z) = $74.\n\nTherefore, the customer spends a total of $74.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{74} \\]"
