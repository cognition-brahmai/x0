        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem about planning a new public park, and I need to figure out the total length of walking trails they're going to build. Let me see if I can break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the park is 100 acres in total. That seems straightforward. Now, the areas are divided up: 30% for playgrounds, 40% for sports fields, and the remaining 30% for walking trails. So, walking trails take up 30% of the park's area.\n\nI need to find the total length of these walking trails, and I know that each trail has an average width of 10 feet. Hmm, okay. So, area is typically calculated in square units, like square feet or acres, and length is in linear units, like feet or miles. So, I need to find the total linear feet of trails based on the area allocated for them.\n\nFirst, let me find out how much area is allocated for the walking trails. Since it's 30% of the park, and the park is 100 acres, the area for trails is:\n\nArea_trails = 30% of 100 acres = 0.30 * 100 = 30 acres\n\nNow, I need to convert this area into square feet because the width of the trails is given in feet. I know that 1 acre is equal to 43,560 square feet. So,\n\nArea_trails in square feet = 30 acres * 43,560 sq ft/acre = 1,306,800 sq ft\n\nOkay, so the total area for walking trails is 1,306,800 square feet.\n\nNow, each trail has an average width of 10 feet. If I think of the trails as rectangular paths, then the area of each trail would be its length times its width. So, for one trail:\n\nArea = Length * Width\n\nBut since there are multiple trails, the total area is the sum of the areas of all individual trails. Assuming all trails have the same width, I can express the total area as:\n\nTotal Area = (Sum of lengths of all trails) * Width\n\nIn this case, the width is 10 feet, and the total area is 1,306,800 square feet. So, if I let L be the total length of all trails combined, then:\n\n1,306,800 sq ft = L * 10 ft\n\nNow, I can solve for L:\n\nL = 1,306,800 sq ft / 10 ft = 130,680 feet\n\nSo, the total length of walking trails is 130,680 feet.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this to confirm. Another thought is that the trails might have some overlaps or intersections, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I think treating them as separate rectangular paths is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trails are circular or have some other shape, but since it's an average width, perhaps the simplification is acceptable.\n\nAlright, so sticking with the initial approach, the total length is 130,680 feet.\n\nPerhaps I should convert this into miles, as trail lengths are often measured in miles. I know that 1 mile equals 5,280 feet. So,\n\nTotal length in miles = 130,680 ft / 5,280 ft/mile \u2248 24.75 miles\n\nThat seems like a lot of trail for a 100-acre park, but maybe it's possible. Let me see: 100 acres is about 0.156 square miles, and having 24.75 miles of trails within that area sounds extensive, but perhaps it's doable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check the area conversion.\n\n1 acre = 43,560 sq ft\n\nSo, 30 acres = 30 * 43,560 = 1,306,800 sq ft\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, Total Length = Total Area / Width = 1,306,800 sq ft / 10 ft = 130,680 ft\n\nYeah, that seems mathematically sound.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of space utilization. If the park is 100 acres, and 30% is for trails, that's 30 acres. If trails are 10 feet wide, then the total length would be the area divided by the width, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can estimate the park's dimensions to see if this makes sense. Let's assume the park is roughly square-shaped. The area is 100 acres, which is 100 * 43,560 = 4,356,000 sq ft.\n\nSide length of a square park would be sqrt(4,356,000) \u2248 2,087 feet.\n\nNow, if the trails are crisscrossing throughout the park, with a total length of 130,680 feet, that's about 130,680 / 2,087 \u2248 62.6 times the length of one side of the park.\n\nThat seems excessive; it's like walking across the park 62 times. Maybe I've misinterpreted something.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to consider that the trails might have two sides, meaning the width is effectively double if they are paths with width on both sides. But the problem says \"average width of 10 feet,\" so probably it's the total width of the trail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the width includes some buffer area on both sides. But the problem seems straightforward in stating \"average width of 10 feet.\"\n\nLet me consider another approach. Suppose the trails are laid out in a grid pattern within the 30-acre trail area. If the trail area is 30 acres, and the trails are 10 feet wide, then the length would indeed be the area divided by the width.\n\nBut perhaps the trails are not confined to a separate 30-acre area but are spread out across the entire park. Wait, no, the problem says that 30% of the park's area is allocated for walking trails, so the trails occupy 30 acres in total.\n\nSo, in that case, if the trails are, say, 10 feet wide and cover 30 acres, then the total length would be the area divided by the width, which is what I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trails are laid out in a way that they cover the area multiple times, but that seems unlikely.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the trails might have varying widths, but the problem specifies an average width of 10 feet, so using 10 feet for width seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that some areas are used for trails in addition to other features, but the problem states that the areas are allocated distinctly: 30% playgrounds, 40% sports fields, and 30% walking trails.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct, and the total length of walking trails is indeed 130,680 feet, or approximately 24.75 miles.\n\nMaybe the park is designed with a extensive trail system, possibly including loops and varied difficulty levels, hence the lengthy trail network.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trails are very winding and meandering, covering a lot of linear distance within the allocated area.\n\nIn any case, based on the information provided and the calculations, that's the answer I arrive at.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total length of walking trails is \\boxed{130680} feet."
