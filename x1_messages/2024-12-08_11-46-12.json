Each step of the plan should yield an evidence value, produced by calling a function with an input string that could be the original question, previously obtained evidence, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nWikiLookup[input]: Searches Wikipedia for information related to the input string. While it may not always give direct answers, it often provides valuable context.\nTextAnalyzer[input]: Analyzes a body of text and summarizes key points. Particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of information.\nQAHelper[input]: Answers questions using general knowledge or specific context provided through previous evidence. \n\nEach function requires a simple string as input, without the need for quotes or concatenation symbols. For instance, QAHelper[Who won the 2020 presidential election, given :evidence2:?].\n\nEnsure each plan step has exactly one corresponding evidence output.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [initial action based on the question]\n:evidence0: = [call to function with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action, considering the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [call to next function with input parameter, possibly referring to earlier evidence such as \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the ultimate answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was Nikola Tesla and what were his major contributions to science?"
