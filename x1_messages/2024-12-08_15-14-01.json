They each use a different set of paintbrushes: Laura's brushes have red handles, Neil's have blue handles, Olivia's have green handles, and Peter's have yellow handles. They take a break and leave their paintbrushes on the table. While they're gone, the art teacher cleans all the brushes and places them in a common container to dry. When the students return, where will they expect to find their individual paintbrushes?"

        "content": "When the students return, they will likely expect to find their individual paintbrushes in the common container where the art teacher placed them after cleaning. Since the teacher cleaned all the brushes and put them in one central location to dry, the students would reasonable assume that their brushes are now in that container, regardless of the handle colors.\n\nHowever, it's possible that some students might initially look for their brushes in their original spots on the table, especially if they didn't witness the teacher moving them. But upon not finding them there, they should realize that the teacher has collected and centralized the brushes for drying.\n\nSo, in summary, the students should check the common container for their individual paintbrushes upon returning from their break."
