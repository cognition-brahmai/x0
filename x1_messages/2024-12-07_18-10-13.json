        "content": "So I've got this complex number, z = 3 + 4i, and I need to find its magnitude and argument. Alright, let's start with the magnitude.\n\nI remember that the magnitude of a complex number z = a + bi is given by the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So, for z = 3 + 4i, a is 3 and b is 4.\n\nFirst, I'll square a and b:\n\na\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 = 9\n\nb\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 = 16\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n9 + 16 = 25\n\nThen, take the square root of that:\n\n\u221a25 = 5\n\nSo, the magnitude of z is 5.\n\nNext, I need to find the argument. The argument of a complex number is the angle it makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane. I think it's calculated using the arctangent of b over a, right?\n\nSo, argument = arctan(b/a) = arctan(4/3)\n\nLet me calculate that. 4 divided by 3 is approximately 1.333.\n\nNow, arctan(1.333)... I'm not sure what that is exactly. Maybe I can use a calculator for this part.\n\nWait, but I should probably leave it in terms of arctan unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, I know that arctan(1) is \u03c0/4 radians, which is 45 degrees. Since 4/3 is greater than 1, the angle should be greater than 45 degrees.\n\nMaybe I can find the exact value. Let's see, is there a triangle with sides 3 and 4 where the angle can be determined easily?\n\nOh, right, a 3-4-5 triangle is a right-angled triangle. So, in this case, the angle whose tangent is 4/3 would correspond to one of the angles in this triangle.\n\nSo, if I have opposite side 4 and adjacent side 3, then the angle \u03b8 is such that tan \u03b8 = 4/3.\n\nI can use the inverse tangent function to find \u03b8.\n\nUsing a calculator, arctan(4/3) is approximately 0.927 radians.\n\nWait, but I should check if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert it to degrees to have a better understanding.\n\n0.927 radians * (180/\u03c0) \u2248 53.13 degrees.\n\nYes, that makes sense because, in a 3-4-5 triangle, the angles are approximately 36.87 degrees, 53.13 degrees, and 90 degrees.\n\nSo, the argument is approximately 0.927 radians or 53.13 degrees.\n\nBut since the complex number is in the first quadrant (both real and imaginary parts are positive), the argument should indeed be a positive angle less than \u03c0/2 radians.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the argument in radians without approximation.\n\nSo, argument = arctan(4/3)\n\nTherefore, the magnitude is 5 and the argument is arctan(4/3) radians.\n\nI think that's the precise way to express it.\n\nAlternatively, if needed, I can leave the argument in degrees as approximately 53.13 degrees.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify, I'll keep it in radians.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nMagnitude: 5\n\nArgument: arctan(4/3) radians \u2248 0.927 radians\n\nOr approximately 53.13 degrees if degrees are preferred.\n\nI think that's it. Hopefully, I did this correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe magnitude of the complex number \\( z = 3 + 4i \\) is \\( 5 \\), and its argument is \\( \\arctan\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\) radians, which is approximately \\( 0.927 \\) radians or \\( 53.13^\\circ \\)."
