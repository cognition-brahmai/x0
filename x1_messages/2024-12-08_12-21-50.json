        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a store offering a discount on bulk purchases of apples. The price per pound decreases by 2% for every additional pound purchased, but there's a cap on the discount at 20%. The question is asking how many pounds one must purchase to receive this maximum discount of 20%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of pounds purchased and the discount received. It says the discount increases by 2% for each additional pound, up to a maximum of 20%. So, for each pound bought, the discount goes up by 2%.\n\nLet me try to formulate this. If I buy 1 pound, the discount is 2%. If I buy 2 pounds, the discount is 4%, and so on. This seems like a simple arithmetic progression where the discount increases by 2% per each additional pound.\n\nSo, the discount (D) as a function of the number of pounds (P) purchased can be expressed as:\n\nD = 2% * P\n\nBut, this increase continues until the discount reaches the maximum of 20%. So, I need to find the value of P when D = 20%.\n\nSetting up the equation:\n\n2% * P = 20%\n\nNow, I can solve for P:\n\nP = 20% / 2% = 10\n\nSo, according to this, purchasing 10 pounds would give a discount of 20%.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this. If P = 10, then D = 2% * 10 = 20%, which matches the maximum discount. So, it seems straightforward.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other factor or if I've misinterpreted the way the discount is applied. The problem says \"the price per pound decreases by 2% for every additional pound purchased.\" So, for each extra pound bought, the discount per pound increases by 2%.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the first pound gets no discount, the second pound gets 2% discount, the third gets 4%, and so on, up to a maximum discount of 20%. But, the way it's worded, it seems like the discount applies uniformly to all pounds purchased once the threshold is reached.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify this. Let's consider:\n\n- If I buy 1 pound, the discount is 0% (since it starts decreasing only with additional pounds).\n\n- If I buy 2 pounds, the discount is 2%.\n\n- If I buy 3 pounds, the discount is 4%.\n\n- And so on, up to a maximum discount of 20%.\n\nSo, the discount applies to all pounds purchased at the rate corresponding to the number of pounds bought.\n\nGiven that, my earlier calculation seems correct: P = 20% / 2% = 10 pounds.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Suppose I want to confirm this step by step.\n\nStart with P = 1, D = 0% (since it's the first pound, no additional pounds yet).\n\nP = 2, D = 2%.\n\nP = 3, D = 4%.\n\n...\n\nEach additional pound adds 2% to the discount rate.\n\nSo, the discount rate D is given by D = 2% * (P - 1), because the first pound has no discount.\n\nWait, this seems like a more accurate interpretation.\n\nSo, D = 2% * (P - 1)\n\nWe want D = 20%, so:\n\n2% * (P - 1) = 20%\n\nDivide both sides by 2%:\n\nP - 1 = 10\n\nTherefore, P = 11\n\nSo, purchasing 11 pounds would give a discount of 20%.\n\nThis seems to contradict my earlier result. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me see. If P = 11, then D = 2% * (11 - 1) = 2% * 10 = 20%, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if P = 10, D = 2% * (10 - 1) = 2% * 9 = 18%, which is below the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of pounds to purchase to reach the maximum discount of 20% is 11 pounds.\n\nI think the confusion arose from whether the first pound gets a discount or not. According to the problem, the discount starts for additional pounds purchased beyond the first one.\n\nHence, the discount is applied based on the number of pounds beyond the first, each adding 2% to the discount rate.\n\nTherefore, to achieve a 20% discount, one needs to purchase 11 pounds of apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
