        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are two boxes: one with 10 white balls and another with 10 black balls. I need to redistribute the balls between the two boxes to maximize the probability of picking a white ball. I have to do this in a way that when I randomly select one box and then randomly pick a ball from that box, I have the highest chance possible of getting a white ball.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current setup. There are two boxes:\n\n- Box A: 10 white balls\n\n- Box B: 10 black balls\n\nI'm to redistribute these balls between the two boxes. The goal is to maximize the probability of selecting a white ball after randomly choosing a box and then randomly selecting a ball from that box.\n\nLet me think about how probability works in this scenario. Since I'm choosing a box at random, the probability of selecting either box is 1/2. Then, depending on which box I pick, there's a certain probability of selecting a white ball from that box.\n\nSo, the total probability of selecting a white ball is:\n\nP(white) = P(select Box A) * P(white | Box A) + P(select Box B) * P(white | Box B)\n\nGiven that P(select Box A) = P(select Box B) = 1/2, this simplifies to:\n\nP(white) = (1/2) * P(white | Box A) + (1/2) * P(white | Box B)\n\nSo, to maximize P(white), I need to maximize the sum of the probabilities of picking a white ball from each box, weighted by the probability of selecting each box.\n\nNow, I need to decide how to redistribute the balls. I can move some balls from one box to the other, but I have to decide how many to move and from which box to which.\n\nLet's consider different scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Keep the boxes as they are.\n\n- Box A: 10 white balls\n\n- Box B: 10 black balls\n\nThen,\n\nP(white | Box A) = 10/10 = 1\n\nP(white | Box B) = 0/10 = 0\n\nSo, P(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*0 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nOkay, that's the baseline. Let's see if I can do better.\n\nScenario 2: Move one white ball from Box A to Box B.\n\n- Box A: 9 white balls\n\n- Box B: 10 black balls + 1 white ball = 11 balls\n\nNow,\n\nP(white | Box A) = 9/9 = 1\n\nP(white | Box B) = 1/11\n\nSo, P(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(1/11) = 1/2 + 1/22 = 11/22 + 1/22 = 12/22 = 6/11 \u2248 0.545\n\nThat's better than 0.5.\n\nScenario 3: Move two white balls from Box A to Box B.\n\n- Box A: 8 white balls\n\n- Box B: 10 black balls + 2 white balls = 12 balls\n\nP(white | Box A) = 8/8 = 1\n\nP(white | Box B) = 2/12 = 1/6\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(1/6) = 1/2 + 1/12 = 7/12 \u2248 0.583\n\nEven better.\n\nScenario 4: Move three white balls from Box A to Box B.\n\n- Box A: 7 white balls\n\n- Box B: 10 black balls + 3 white balls = 13 balls\n\nP(white | Box A) = 7/7 = 1\n\nP(white | Box B) = 3/13\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(3/13) = 1/2 + 3/26 = 13/26 + 3/26 = 16/26 \u2248 0.615\n\nStill better.\n\nWait a minute, I see a pattern here. Each time I move one white ball from Box A to Box B, the probability of picking a white ball increases.\n\nLet me generalize this.\n\nSuppose I move k white balls from Box A to Box B.\n\nThen,\n\n- Box A: 10 - k white balls\n\n- Box B: 10 black balls + k white balls\n\nAssuming I don't move all the white balls, so 0 \u2264 k < 10.\n\nThen,\n\nP(white | Box A) = (10 - k)/(10 - k) = 1 (as long as there are balls in Box A)\n\nP(white | Box B) = k/(10 + k)\n\nSo, P(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(k/(10 + k))\n\nI need to maximize this expression with respect to k.\n\nLet me define the function:\n\nf(k) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(k/(10 + k)) = 1/2 + (k)/(2*(10 + k))\n\nTo find the maximum, I can take the derivative of f(k) with respect to k and set it to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find f'(k):\n\nf'(k) = d/dk [1/2 + (k)/(2*(10 + k))]\n\nThe derivative of 1/2 is 0.\n\nNow, d/dk [k/(2*(10 + k))] = (1*(2*(10 + k)) - k*2)/(2*(10 + k))^2)\n\nWait, that seems messy. Let's simplify.\n\nLet me rewrite the function:\n\nf(k) = 1/2 + (1/(2))*(k/(10 + k))\n\nLet g(k) = k/(10 + k)\n\nThen, f(k) = 1/2 + (1/2)*g(k)\n\nSo, f'(k) = (1/2)*g'(k)\n\nNow, g(k) = k/(10 + k)\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\ng'(k) = [(10 + k)*1 - k*1]/(10 + k)^2 = (10 + k - k)/(10 + k)^2 = 10/(10 + k)^2\n\nTherefore, f'(k) = (1/2)*(10)/(10 + k)^2 = 5/(10 + k)^2\n\nNow, set f'(k) = 0 to find critical points:\n\n5/(10 + k)^2 = 0\n\nBut this equation has no solution because the numerator is 5, which is not zero, and the denominator is always positive.\n\nThis suggests that there are no critical points in the interior of the interval 0 \u2264 k < 10.\n\nTherefore, the maximum must occur at one of the endpoints.\n\nLet's evaluate f(k) at k = 0 and as k approaches 10.\n\nAt k = 0:\n\nf(0) = 1/2 + (1/2)*(0)/(10 + 0) = 1/2 + 0 = 1/2\n\nAt k = 10:\n\nf(10) = 1/2 + (1/2)*(10)/(10 + 10) = 1/2 + (1/2)*(10)/20 = 1/2 + (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4\n\nWait, but earlier I had considered moving k = 1, 2, 3, etc., and the probability was increasing with k.\n\nBut at k = 10, P(white) = 3/4 = 0.75, which is higher than the previous values.\n\nWait, but in my earlier scenarios, when k = 3, P(white) \u2248 0.615, and at k = 10, it's 0.75, which is higher.\n\nWait, but in scenario 4, k = 3, P(white) = 16/26 \u2248 0.615, but at k = 10, P(white) = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nSo, moving more white balls to Box B increases the probability.\n\nWait, but if I move all 10 white balls to Box B, then:\n\n- Box A: 0 white balls (but boxes need to have balls, right?)\n\nWait, the problem says \"redistribute the balls between the two boxes in such a way that when you randomly pick a box and then randomly pick a ball from that box...\"\n\nIt doesn't specify that each box must contain at least one ball. So, maybe Box A can be empty.\n\nBut if Box A is empty, then P(white | Box A) is undefined because there are no balls to pick from.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to ensure that both boxes have at least one ball.\n\nAssuming that both boxes must contain at least one ball, then k can be from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, k = 0 to 9.\n\nAt k = 0: P(white) = 0.5\n\nAt k = 1: P(white) = 1/2 + (1/2)*(1/11) = 1/2 + 1/22 = 12/22 \u2248 0.545\n\nAt k = 2: P(white) = 1/2 + (1/2)*(2/12) = 1/2 + 1/12 = 7/12 \u2248 0.583\n\nAt k = 3: P(white) = 1/2 + (1/2)*(3/13) = 1/2 + 3/26 = 16/26 \u2248 0.615\n\n...\n\nAt k = 9: P(white) = 1/2 + (1/2)*(9/19) = 1/2 + 9/38 = 19/38 + 9/38 = 28/38 \u2248 0.737\n\nAnd at k = 10: P(white) = 1/2 + (1/2)*(10/20) = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 = 0.75\n\nBut if k = 10, Box A has 0 balls, which might not be allowed.\n\nSo, if both boxes must contain at least one ball, then the maximum is at k = 9, with P(white) = 28/38 \u2248 0.737.\n\nBut if allowing one box to be empty is permitted, then k = 10 gives P(white) = 0.75.\n\nBut perhaps the problem implies that each box must contain at least one ball.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \"redistribute the balls between the two boxes in such a way that when you randomly pick a box and then randomly pick a ball from that box...\"\n\nIt doesn't explicitly say that each box must contain at least one ball, but practically, picking a box with no balls wouldn't make sense.\n\nSo, maybe it's safe to assume that each box must contain at least one ball.\n\nTherefore, the optimal k is 9, with P(white) = 28/38 \u2248 0.737.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait a second, perhaps instead of moving only white balls, I can move some black balls as well.\n\nLet's consider moving some black balls to the box with white balls.\n\nScenario 5: Move one black ball from Box B to Box A.\n\n- Box A: 10 white + 1 black = 11 balls\n\n- Box B: 9 black balls\n\nThen,\n\nP(white | Box A) = 10/11\n\nP(white | Box B) = 0/9 = 0\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*(10/11) + (1/2)*0 = 5/11 \u2248 0.454\n\nThat's worse than the initial 0.5.\n\nScenario 6: Move two black balls from Box B to Box A.\n\n- Box A: 10 white + 2 black = 12 balls\n\n- Box B: 8 black balls\n\nP(white | Box A) = 10/12 = 5/6\n\nP(white | Box B) = 0/8 = 0\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*(5/6) + (1/2)*0 = 5/12 \u2248 0.417\n\nWorse than before.\n\nScenario 7: Move one white ball from Box A to Box B, and one black ball from Box B to Box A.\n\n- Box A: 9 white + 1 black = 10 balls\n\n- Box B: 9 black + 1 white = 10 balls\n\nThen,\n\nP(white | Box A) = 9/10\n\nP(white | Box B) = 1/10\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*(9/10) + (1/2)*(1/10) = 9/20 + 1/20 = 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nSame as the initial setup.\n\nNot better than moving only white balls.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I move only one white ball to Box B, and leave the rest as is.\n\n- Box A: 9 white balls\n\n- Box B: 10 black + 1 white = 11 balls\n\nP(white | Box A) = 9/9 = 1\n\nP(white | Box B) = 1/11\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(1/11) = 1/2 + 1/22 = 12/22 \u2248 0.545\n\nBetter than 0.5.\n\nBut earlier, with k = 9, P(white) \u2248 0.737.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider moving more white balls to Box B.\n\nWait, but in k = 9, P(white) = 28/38 \u2248 0.737.\n\nIs there a way to do better than that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving some black balls to Box A could help, but earlier scenarios suggest it decreases the probability.\n\nWait, perhaps moving only one white ball to Box B and leaving Box A with 9 white balls is not optimal.\n\nWait, but according to the general formula, higher k gives higher P(white), up to k = 9.\n\nLet me calculate P(white) for k = 9.\n\n- Box A: 1 white ball\n\n- Box B: 10 black + 9 white = 19 balls\n\nP(white | Box A) = 1/1 = 1\n\nP(white | Box B) = 9/19\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(9/19) = 1/2 + 9/38 = 19/38 + 9/38 = 28/38 \u2248 0.737\n\nAnd for k = 10, Box A: 0 white balls (not allowed), Box B: 10 black + 10 white = 20 balls\n\nP(white | Box A): undefined\n\nP(white | Box B) = 10/20 = 1/2\n\nBut since Box A has no balls, effectively, you always pick Box B, so P(white) = 1/2.\n\nBut that's worse than 0.737.\n\nTherefore, k = 9 seems to be the optimal.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me consider putting just one white ball in one box and the rest in the other.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- Box A: 1 white ball\n\n- Box B: 9 white + 10 black = 19 balls\n\nThen,\n\nP(white | Box A) = 1/1 = 1\n\nP(white | Box B) = 9/19\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(9/19) = 1/2 + 9/38 = 19/38 + 9/38 = 28/38 \u2248 0.737\n\nSame as above.\n\nAlternatively,\n\n- Box A: 2 white balls\n\n- Box B: 8 white + 10 black = 18 balls\n\nP(white | Box A) = 2/2 = 1\n\nP(white | Box B) = 8/18 = 4/9\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(4/9) = 1/2 + 4/18 = 9/18 + 4/18 = 13/18 \u2248 0.722\n\nWhich is less than 0.737.\n\nSo, moving more white balls to Box B increases P(white).\n\nWait, but at k = 9, P(white) \u2248 0.737, and at k = 2, P(white) \u2248 0.722.\n\nYes, 0.737 is higher.\n\nSo, moving 9 white balls to Box B seems better.\n\nWait, but what if I move all 10 white balls to Box B, and Box A has 10 black balls.\n\nBut then, Box A has only black balls, so P(white | Box A) = 0.\n\nBox B has 10 white + 10 black = 20 balls, so P(white | Box B) = 10/20 = 1/2.\n\nThen, P(white) = (1/2)*0 + (1/2)*(1/2) = 0 + 1/4 = 1/4 = 0.25\n\nWhich is worse than before.\n\nSo, that's not a good idea.\n\nTherefore, the best seems to be moving 9 white balls to Box B and leaving 1 white ball in Box A.\n\n- Box A: 1 white ball\n\n- Box B: 10 black + 9 white = 19 balls\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(9/19) \u2248 0.737\n\nBut maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps if I don't make Box A have only white balls, but include some black balls as well.\n\nLet's try:\n\n- Box A: 1 white + 1 black = 2 balls\n\n- Box B: 9 white + 9 black = 18 balls\n\nThen,\n\nP(white | Box A) = 1/2\n\nP(white | Box B) = 9/18 = 1/2\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nWhich is worse than earlier.\n\nNot better.\n\nAnother idea:\n\n- Box A: 2 white + 1 black = 3 balls\n\n- Box B: 8 white + 9 black = 17 balls\n\nP(white | Box A) = 2/3\n\nP(white | Box B) = 8/17\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*(2/3) + (1/2)*(8/17) = (1/3) + (4/17) = (17/51 + 12/51) = 29/51 \u2248 0.569\n\nWhich is better than 0.5, but less than 0.737.\n\nNot better than moving 9 white balls to Box B.\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n- Box A: 3 white + 1 black = 4 balls\n\n- Box B: 7 white + 9 black = 16 balls\n\nP(white | Box A) = 3/4\n\nP(white | Box B) = 7/16\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*(3/4) + (1/2)*(7/16) = 3/8 + 7/32 = 12/32 + 7/32 = 19/32 \u2248 0.594\n\nStill less than 0.737.\n\nAnother one:\n\n- Box A: 4 white + 1 black = 5 balls\n\n- Box B: 6 white + 9 black = 15 balls\n\nP(white | Box A) = 4/5\n\nP(white | Box B) = 6/15 = 2/5\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*(4/5) + (1/2)*(2/5) = 4/10 + 2/10 = 6/10 = 0.6\n\nStill less than 0.737.\n\nIt seems that the strategy of moving as many white balls as possible to Box B, while keeping at least one white ball in Box A, maximizes the probability.\n\nWait, but why does this work?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nBy keeping one white ball in Box A, P(white | Box A) = 1, which is the maximum possible.\n\nThen, in Box B, having as many white balls as possible increases P(white | Box B).\n\nSo, the more white balls in Box B, the higher P(white | Box B), but P(white | Box A) remains 1.\n\nTherefore, the overall P(white) increases.\n\nBut, if I move all white balls to Box B, Box A has only black balls, which reduces P(white) significantly.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to keep at least one white ball in Box A and move as many white balls as possible to Box B.\n\nIn this case, with k = 9, P(white) = 28/38 \u2248 0.737.\n\nIs there a way to make it even higher?\n\nWait, perhaps if I have more than one white ball in Box A.\n\nWait, earlier scenarios suggest that having more than one white ball in Box A doesn't improve the overall probability as much as concentrating white balls in Box B.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Box A: 2 white balls\n\n- Box B: 8 white + 10 black = 18 balls\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*(2/2) + (1/2)*(8/18) = 1/2 + 4/18 = 9/18 + 4/18 = 13/18 \u2248 0.722\n\nWhich is less than 0.737.\n\nSimilarly, with Box A having more white balls, P(white) decreases.\n\nWait, no, in the previous calculation, 13/18 \u2248 0.722 is less than 28/38 \u2248 0.737.\n\nTherefore, it's better to have only one white ball in Box A and move the rest to Box B.\n\nIs there a way to make P(white) even higher than 28/38?\n\nPerhaps not, unless there's a different redistribution strategy.\n\nWait, maybe if I have Box A with fewer balls, but higher proportion of white balls.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Box A: 1 white ball (only one ball in total)\n\n- Box B: 9 white + 10 black = 19 balls\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(9/19) = 1/2 + 9/38 = 19/38 + 9/38 = 28/38 \u2248 0.737\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Box A: 1 white + 1 black = 2 balls\n\n- Box B: 9 white + 9 black = 18 balls\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/2)*(9/18) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2\n\nWhich is worse.\n\nAnother idea:\n\n- Box A: 1 white + 0 black = 1 ball\n\n- Box B: 9 white + 10 black = 19 balls\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(9/19) = 1/2 + 9/38 = 28/38 \u2248 0.737\n\nSame as before.\n\nWait, but I can't have Box A with only white balls if I move all white balls to Box B.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal distribution is to have Box A with only one white ball, and Box B with all other balls.\n\nLet me calculate again.\n\n- Box A: 1 white ball\n\n- Box B: 9 white + 10 black = 19 balls\n\nP(white) = (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(9/19) = 1/2 + 9/38 = 19/38 + 9/38 = 28/38 \u2248 0.737\n\nYes, that seems to be the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the optimal redistribution is to place one white ball in one box and the remaining nine white balls and all ten black balls in the other box.\n\nSo, the answer is to put one white ball in one box and the remaining balls in the other box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Place one white ball in one box and all the remaining balls in the other box.}}"
