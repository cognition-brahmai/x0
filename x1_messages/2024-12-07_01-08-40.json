        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with balls of different colors: 4 red, 6 blue, and 5 green. So, total balls in the bag are 4 + 6 + 5, which is 15 balls. The question is, if I pick one ball at random, what's the probability that it's either red or blue.\n\nOkay, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball. So, the number of favorable outcomes should be the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls, which is 4 + 6 = 10. And the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 15.\n\nSo, the probability should be 10/15. But I can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5, which gives 2/3. So, the probability is 2/3.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of OR in probability. I remember that for two events A or B, the probability is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). But in this case, picking a red ball and picking a blue ball are mutually exclusive events because a ball can't be both red and blue at the same time. So, P(A and B) is 0.\n\nTherefore, P(red or blue) = P(red) + P(blue) - 0 = P(red) + P(blue).\n\nWe already know P(red) is 4/15 and P(blue) is 6/15. So, P(red or blue) = 4/15 + 6/15 = 10/15 = 2/3.\n\nHmm, same answer. Good, that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check what's the probability of picking a green ball. It should be 5/15 = 1/3. And since red, blue, and green are the only colors, the probabilities should add up to 1. So, P(red) + P(blue) + P(green) = 4/15 + 6/15 + 5/15 = 15/15 = 1. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, the probability of picking a red or blue ball could also be 1 minus the probability of picking a green ball. So, 1 - 5/15 = 10/15 = 2/3. Again, same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
