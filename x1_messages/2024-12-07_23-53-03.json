        "content": "So Jill has 10 apples, and Jack has twice as many apples as Jill. To find out how many apples Jack has, I need to multiply the number of apples Jill has by 2, right?\n\nSo, if Jill has 10 apples, then Jack has 2 times 10, which is 20 apples.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using equations. Let's say Jill's apples are represented by J. So J equals 10. Then Jack's apples are 2 times J, which is 2 times 10, again 20.\n\nOr, if I think about it in terms of addition, having twice as many apples as Jill would mean Jack has Jill's amount plus another equal amount. So 10 plus another 10 equals 20.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, Jack has 20 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
