Each step of your plan should be followed by an evidence value, which will represent the output of one of the functions given an input string that can either be the user's query, previous evidence values or both.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that allows users to search for information on the internet. This tool is useful in finding relevant websites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from web pages given a list of URLs separated by newlines. The function produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkCollector[input]: Collects all links present in a block of text and outputs them as a newline-separated list.\nQAEngine[input]: A tool that answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action based on the input question]\n:evidence1: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on the result of :evidence1:]\n:evidence2: = [next function to call with input parameter, possibly referencing previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: What is the main ingredient in a traditional Greek moussaka and what does it taste like?"

I think the best way to approach this is to first understand what moussaka is and then identify its key components.\n\nPlan: Start by searching for information about traditional Greek moussaka.\n\n:evidence1: = WebSearch[\"traditional Greek moussaka recipe\"]\n\nNow, with the search results from :evidence1:, I need to find reliable sources that provide information on the main ingredients of moussaka. Probably, I should look for recipes or articles that discuss the history and composition of this dish.\n\nPlan: Extract the relevant links from the search results that offer detailed information about moussaka's ingredients.\n\n:evidence2: = LinkCollector[:evidence1:]\n\nWith the list of links from :evidence2:, I need to access these pages to get the actual information. Since reading through multiple pages would be time-consuming, I'll use a tool to extract the text from these links.\n\nPlan: Use TextExtractor to get the content from the top links.\n\n:evidence3: = TextExtractor[:evidence2:]\n\nNow, :evidence3: should contain the text from the selected web pages. I need to find the main ingredient mentioned in these texts. Moussaka is a layered dish, so it might have several key ingredients, but I need to pinpoint the primary one.\n\nPlan: Look for mentions of main ingredients in the extracted text.\n\n:evidence4: = QAEngine[\"What is the main ingredient in traditional Greek moussaka according to :evidence3:?\"]\n\nAssuming :evidence4: provides me with the main ingredient, I need to describe its taste. For that, I might need additional information about that specific ingredient.\n\nPlan: If :evidence4: identifies the main ingredient, search for information about its taste.\n\n:evidence5: = WebSearch[\"taste of :evidence4:\"]\n\nThen, collect the links from this search to find descriptions of the taste.\n\nPlan: Extract relevant links from the search results about the taste of the main ingredient.\n\n:evidence6: = LinkCollector[:evidence5:]\n\nExtract text from these links to get descriptions of the taste.\n\nPlan: Use TextExtractor to get the content from the links about the taste.\n\n:evidence7: = TextExtractor[:evidence6:]\n\nFinally, summarize the taste description from :evidence7:.\n\nPlan: Summarize the taste of the main ingredient from :evidence7:.\n\n:evidence8: = QAEngine[\"Summarize the taste of :evidence4: based on :evidence7:.\"]\n\nNow, compile the information from :evidence4: and :evidence8: to provide a comprehensive answer to the user's question.\n\nFinal Answer: The main ingredient in traditional Greek moussaka is :evidence4:, which tastes like :evidence8:.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe main ingredient in traditional Greek moussaka is eggplant, which has a mild, slightly sweet flavor and a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture when cooked properly."
