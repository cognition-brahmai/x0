The expression is:\n\n((6 * 5)^2 / (9 * 10)) - 3^3\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\nInside the first set of parentheses, I have (6 * 5). That's 30.\n\nSo, (6 * 5) = 30\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n(30^2 / (9 * 10)) - 3^3\n\nNext, inside the second set of parentheses, I have (9 * 10). That's 90.\n\nSo, (9 * 10) = 90\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n(30^2 / 90) - 3^3\n\nNow, moving on to exponents:\n\n30 squared is 900, and 3 cubed is 27.\n\nSo, 30^2 = 900\n\nAnd 3^3 = 27\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n(900 / 90) - 27\n\nNext, division:\n\n900 divided by 90 is 10.\n\nSo, 900 / 90 = 10\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n10 - 27\n\nFinally, subtraction:\n\n10 minus 27 is -17.\n\nSo, the final answer is -17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-17} \\]"
