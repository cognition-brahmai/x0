        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If you invest $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded quarterly, how much will your investment be worth after 5 years? Okay, let's break this down. I remember that compound interest means that the interest earned is added to the principal, and then future interest is calculated on this new amount, so it kind of snowballs over time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the terms here. The principal amount is $10,000, the annual interest rate is 4%, and it's compounded quarterly. That means the interest is calculated and added to the principal every quarter, which is every three months. There are four quarters in a year, so the interest will be compounded four times a year.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP = $10,000\n\nr = 4% = 0.04 (as a decimal)\n\nn = 4 (since it's compounded quarterly)\n\nt = 5 years\n\nNow, let's plug these into the formula:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5)\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n\n0.04 / 4 = 0.01\n\nSo, each quarter, 1% interest is added.\n\nNow, add 1 to this rate:\n\n1 + 0.01 = 1.01\n\nNext, raise this to the power of (n*t), which is 4*5=20:\n\n1.01^20\n\nI need to calculate 1.01 raised to the 20th power. Let's see:\n\n1.01^1 = 1.01\n\n1.01^2 = 1.0201\n\n1.01^3 = 1.030301\n\n1.01^4 = 1.04060401\n\n1.01^5 = 1.0510100501\n\n1.01^10 is approximately 1.1046221254112045\n\n1.01^20 is approximately 1.2201900399433365\n\nSo, A = 10000 * 1.2201900399433365 = approximately $12,201.90\n\nWait, but I think I can double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I can use a different method or verify the steps.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step. Since the interest is compounded quarterly, every three months the investment grows by 1% (because 4% annual rate divided by 4 is 1% per quarter).\n\nSo, after the first quarter:\n\n$10,000 + 1% of $10,000 = $10,000 * 1.01 = $10,100\n\nAfter the second quarter:\n\n$10,100 + 1% of $10,100 = $10,100 * 1.01 = $10,201\n\nAfter the third quarter:\n\n$10,201 * 1.01 = $10,303.01\n\nAfter the fourth quarter (which is the end of the first year):\n\n$10,303.01 * 1.01 = $10,406.04\n\nSo, after one year, the investment is worth $10,406.04\n\nNow, repeating this process for each subsequent year:\n\nEnd of year 2:\n\n$10,406.04 * 1.01^4\n\nFirst, calculate 1.01^4:\n\n1.01^4 = 1.04060401\n\nSo, $10,406.04 * 1.04060401 = approximately $10,824.32\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If at the end of year 1 it's $10,406.04, and I'm compounding quarterly, I need to apply the 1% quarterly rate for each of the four quarters in the second year.\n\nSo, more accurately:\n\nEnd of year 2:\n\n$10,406.04 * 1.01^4\n\nCalculate 1.01^4:\n\n1.01^4 = 1.04060401\n\nSo, $10,406.04 * 1.04060401 = approximately $10,824.32\n\nWait, but this seems inconsistent with the initial formula calculation. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nPerhaps it's better to use the compound interest formula directly:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nA = 10000 * (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5)\n\nA = 10000 * (1 + 0.01)^20\n\nA = 10000 * (1.01)^20\n\nNow, calculating (1.01)^20:\n\nI know that (1 + x)^n is approximately equal to 1 + n*x when x is small, but for accuracy, I'll use a more precise calculation.\n\nUsing a calculator, 1.01^20 is approximately 1.22019004.\n\nTherefore, A = 10000 * 1.22019004 = $12,201.90\n\nSo, after 5 years, the investment would be worth approximately $12,201.90\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that there's also a formula for the effective annual rate, which might be relevant here. The effective annual rate (EAR) is the actual interest rate earned in one year, taking into account compounding.\n\nThe formula for EAR is:\n\nEAR = (1 + r/n)^n - 1\n\nSo, for this example:\n\nEAR = (1 + 0.04/4)^4 - 1 = (1.01)^4 - 1 = 1.04060401 - 1 = 0.04060401, or approximately 4.06%\n\nSo, the investment grows by approximately 4.06% each year.\n\nTherefore, over 5 years, the total growth would be:\n\nA = P * (1 + EAR)^t = 10000 * (1.04060401)^5\n\nCalculating (1.04060401)^5:\n\n1.04060401^1 = 1.04060401\n\n1.04060401^2 = approximately 1.08243216\n\n1.04060401^3 = approximately 1.12550876\n\n1.04060401^4 = approximately 1.16989726\n\n1.04060401^5 = approximately 1.21550608\n\nTherefore, A = 10000 * 1.21550608 = $12,155.06\n\nWait, this is different from the earlier calculation of $12,201.90. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nUsing the compound interest formula directly:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nA = 10000 * (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*5)\n\nA = 10000 * (1.01)^20\n\nUsing a calculator, (1.01)^20 = 1.22019004\n\nSo, A = 10000 * 1.22019004 = $12,201.90\n\nNow, using the effective annual rate:\n\nEAR = (1 + 0.04/4)^4 - 1 = 1.04060401 - 1 = 0.04060401\n\nThen, A = P * (1 + EAR)^t = 10000 * (1.04060401)^5\n\nCalculating (1.04060401)^5:\n\n1.04060401^5 = approximately 1.2166529\n\nSo, A = 10000 * 1.2166529 = $12,166.53\n\nHmm, this is still not matching the earlier result of $12,201.90. There must be a mistake in one of these approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps the discrepancy is due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps. Let's try to be more precise.\n\nFirst, calculate the quarterly interest rate:\n\nr/n = 0.04 / 4 = 0.01\n\nThen, calculate the total number of compounding periods:\n\nnt = 4 * 5 = 20\n\nNow, calculate (1 + r/n)^(nt) = (1.01)^20\n\nUsing a calculator with higher precision:\n\n(1.01)^20 = 1.2201900399433365\n\nTherefore, A = 10000 * 1.2201900399433365 = $12,201.90\n\nNow, using the effective annual rate method:\n\nEAR = (1 + 0.01)^4 - 1 = 1.04060401 - 1 = 0.04060401\n\nThen, A = 10000 * (1.04060401)^5\n\nCalculating (1.04060401)^5 more accurately:\n\n1.04060401^5 = 1.2166529488968467\n\nSo, A = 10000 * 1.2166529488968467 = $12,166.53\n\nThere's still a difference between $12,201.90 and $12,166.53. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the discrepancy arises because the effective annual rate method is compounding annually, whereas the actual compounding is quarterly. Therefore, using the compound interest formula directly is more accurate for this scenario.\n\nHence, the correct amount after 5 years is $12,201.90\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe calculating the interest quarter by quarter for 5 years.\n\nStarting with $10,000\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = $10,000 * 0.01 = $100\n\nNew balance = $10,000 + $100 = $10,100\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = $10,100 * 0.01 = $101\n\nNew balance = $10,100 + $101 = $10,201\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = $10,201 * 0.01 = $102.01\n\nNew balance = $10,201 + $102.01 = $10,303.01\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = $10,303.01 * 0.01 = $103.03\n\nNew balance = $10,303.01 + $103.03 = $10,406.04\n\nYear 1 end: $10,406.04\n\nYear 2:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = $10,406.04 * 0.01 = $104.06\n\nNew balance = $10,406.04 + $104.06 = $10,510.10\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = $10,510.10 * 0.01 = $105.10\n\nNew balance = $10,510.10 + $105.10 = $10,615.20\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = $10,615.20 * 0.01 = $106.15\n\nNew balance = $10,615.20 + $106.15 = $10,721.35\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = $10,721.35 * 0.01 = $107.21\n\nNew balance = $10,721.35 + $107.21 = $10,828.56\n\nYear 2 end: $10,828.56\n\nYear 3:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = $10,828.56 * 0.01 = $108.29\n\nNew balance = $10,828.56 + $108.29 = $10,936.85\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = $10,936.85 * 0.01 = $109.37\n\nNew balance = $10,936.85 + $109.37 = $11,046.22\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = $11,046.22 * 0.01 = $110.46\n\nNew balance = $11,046.22 + $110.46 = $11,156.68\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = $11,156.68 * 0.01 = $111.57\n\nNew balance = $11,156.68 + $111.57 = $11,268.25\n\nYear 3 end: $11,268.25\n\nYear 4:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = $11,268.25 * 0.01 = $112.68\n\nNew balance = $11,268.25 + $112.68 = $11,380.93\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = $11,380.93 * 0.01 = $113.81\n\nNew balance = $11,380.93 + $113.81 = $11,494.74\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = $11,494.74 * 0.01 = $114.95\n\nNew balance = $11,494.74 + $114.95 = $11,609.69\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = $11,609.69 * 0.01 = $116.10\n\nNew balance = $11,609.69 + $116.10 = $11,725.79\n\nYear 4 end: $11,725.79\n\nYear 5:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = $11,725.79 * 0.01 = $117.26\n\nNew balance = $11,725.79 + $117.26 = $11,843.05\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = $11,843.05 * 0.01 = $118.43\n\nNew balance = $11,843.05 + $118.43 = $11,961.48\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = $11,961.48 * 0.01 = $119.61\n\nNew balance = $11,961.48 + $119.61 = $12,081.09\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = $12,081.09 * 0.01 = $120.81\n\nNew balance = $12,081.09 + $120.81 = $12,201.90\n\nSo, after 5 years, the investment is worth $12,201.90, which matches the initial calculation using the compound interest formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $12,201.90\n\nI think the discrepancy with the effective annual rate method is because it assumes annual compounding, whereas the actual compounding is quarterly. So, using the compound interest formula directly is more accurate in this case.\n\nAlternatively, if the interest was compounded annually, then using the effective annual rate would make sense, but since it's compounded quarterly, the compound interest formula is the way to go.\n\nSo, to summarize, the investment of $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded quarterly, will be worth approximately $12,201.90 after 5 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12201.90} \\]"
