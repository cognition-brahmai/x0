        "content": "So I have this question about poker probabilities. Specifically, I need to find out the chance of getting a flush when you're dealt five cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. A flush means all five cards are of the same suit, right? So, hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades, but they all have to match in suit.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how probabilities work. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw any five cards from the deck, and the favorable outcomes are the ways to draw five cards all from the same suit.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the total number of possible five-card hands from a 52-card deck. That should be the combination of 52 cards taken 5 at a time, without regard to order. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total possible hands = C(52, 5).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n52! / (5! * (52 - 5)!) = (52! / (5! * 47!))\n\nNow, I don't need to calculate the full factorials because a lot of terms will cancel out.\n\nIt's easier to compute it as:\n\n(52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48) / 120.\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n52 \u00d7 51 = 2,652\n\n2,652 \u00d7 50 = 132,600\n\n132,600 \u00d7 49 = 6,500,400\n\n6,500,400 \u00d7 48 = 312,019,200.\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n312,019,200 / 120 = 2,600,160.\n\nSo, there are 2,598,960 possible five-card hands. Wait, I think I did the calculation wrong because I remember that the total number of five-card hands is 2,598,960. Let me check my math again.\n\nActually, 52 choose 5 is 2,598,960. I must have made a mistake in my multiplication. Let me accept that and move on for now.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to get a flush. A flush means all five cards are of the same suit. There are four suits in a deck: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades.\n\nSo, for each suit, the number of ways to choose five cards all from that suit is C(13, 5), because there are 13 cards in each suit.\n\nSo, for one suit, flush hands = C(13, 5).\n\nCalculating C(13, 5):\n\n13! / (5! * (13 - 5)!) = (13! / (5! * 8!))\n\nSimplify:\n\n(13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (154,440) / 120 = 1,287.\n\nSo, for each suit, there are 1,287 possible flush hands.\n\nSince there are four suits, total flush hands = 4 \u00d7 1,287 = 5,148.\n\nWait a minute, but I know that in poker, a straight flush is also a type of flush, but it's a higher-ranking hand. So, should I subtract the number of straight flushes from the total flush hands to get the number of pure flush hands?\n\nActually, in standard poker hand rankings, a straight flush is separate from a flush. So, a flush is five cards of the same suit, but not in sequence. Whereas a straight flush is five cards in sequence and of the same suit.\n\nSo, to accurately calculate the probability of being dealt a flush, I should exclude straight flushes from the flush hands, because straight flushes are a distinct category.\n\nSimilarly, royal flushes are a type of straight flush, so they should also be excluded from the flush hands.\n\nSo, the number of pure flush hands is total flush hands minus straight flush hands.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of straight flush hands.\n\nHow many straight flushes are there in a deck?\n\nWell, a straight flush is five cards in sequence and all of the same suit.\n\nFirst, determine the number of possible sequences.\n\nThe lowest sequence starts with 10 (10, J, Q, K, A), and the highest sequence starts with A (A, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nWait, no. Actually, in poker, a straight can start as low as A, 2, 3, 4, 5, up to 10, J, Q, K, A.\n\nBut, I think in standard rules, A can be low or high, but in straight flushes, it's treated similarly.\n\nSo, the possible sequences are:\n\nA,2,3,4,5\n\n2,3,4,5,6\n\n...\n\n10,J,Q,K,A\n\nSo, that's 10 possible sequences (A through 10 as the starting card).\n\nAnd there are four suits.\n\nSo, total straight flushes = 10 sequences \u00d7 4 suits = 40.\n\nHowever, I know that there are only 36 straight flushes, excluding the four royal flushes.\n\nWait, no. Actually, a royal flush is a type of straight flush, specifically A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to subtract the royal flushes from the straight flushes.\n\nWait, no. Royal flushes are included in straight flushes.\n\nSo, total straight flushes include all sequences from A,2,3,4,5 up to 10,J,Q,K,A, in each suit.\n\nThat's 10 per suit, times 4 suits, so 40 straight flushes in total.\n\nBut I think I'm misremembering. I recall that there are 40 straight flushes, including royal flushes.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nActually, in a standard deck, there are 10 possible sequences for a straight flush:\n\nA,2,3,4,5\n\n2,3,4,5,6\n\n...\n\n10,J,Q,K,A\n\nAnd there are four suits.\n\nSo, 10 sequences \u00d7 4 suits = 40 straight flushes.\n\nHowever, royal flushes are included in these 40 straight flushes, as they are a specific type of straight flush starting with A, K, Q, J, 10.\n\nSo, there are 4 royal flushes within the 40 straight flushes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of straight flushes is 40.\n\nNow, going back to the flush calculation.\n\nTotal flush hands = 4 \u00d7 C(13, 5) = 4 \u00d7 1,287 = 5,148.\n\nBut this includes straight flushes, which we need to exclude to get the number of pure flush hands.\n\nSo, pure flush hands = total flush hands - straight flush hands = 5,148 - 40 = 5,108.\n\nNow, the probability of being dealt a flush is the number of pure flush hands divided by the total number of possible five-card hands.\n\nSo, probability = 5,108 / 2,598,960.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, simplify the fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n5,108 \u00f7 4 = 1,277\n\n2,598,960 \u00f7 4 = 649,740\n\nSo, 1,277 / 649,740.\n\nIs this reducible further? Let's check.\n\nDoes 1,277 have any common factors with 649,740?\n\n1,277 is a prime number, I think.\n\nYes, 1,277 is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nSo, the probability is 1,277 / 649,740.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as a decimal.\n\nLet me divide 1,277 by 649,740.\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n1,277 \u00f7 649,740 \u2248 0.0019654.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n0.0019654 \u00d7 100 \u2248 0.19654%.\n\nSo, approximately 0.197% chance of being dealt a flush.\n\nAlternatively, we can express probability in terms of odds.\n\nOdds are given as the ratio of unfavorable outcomes to favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, odds against a flush are (total hands - flush hands) : flush hands.\n\nThat is (2,598,960 - 5,108) : 5,108 = 2,593,852 : 5,108.\n\nSimplify by dividing both numbers by 4:\n\n648,463 : 1,277.\n\nSo, odds against a flush are about 648,463 to 1,277, which can be approximated as 509 to 1.\n\nWait, let me calculate that ratio.\n\n648,463 \u00f7 1,277 \u2248 507.7.\n\nSo, roughly 508 to 1 odds against being dealt a flush.\n\nAlternatively, it's about 1 in 508 chance.\n\nSo, to summarize, the probability of being dealt a flush in poker is approximately 0.00197, or 0.197%, with odds of about 508 to 1 against.\n\nI think that's the answer, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total number of five-card hands is indeed C(52,5) = 2,598,960.\n\nNumber of flush hands: C(13,5) per suit, times 4 suits, which is 1,287 \u00d7 4 = 5,148.\n\nNumber of straight flush hands is 40 (including royal flushes).\n\nTherefore, pure flush hands are 5,148 - 40 = 5,108.\n\nProbability is 5,108 / 2,598,960 \u2248 0.0019654, or about 0.197%.\n\nOdds are (2,598,960 - 5,108) : 5,108 \u2248 2,593,852 : 5,108, which simplifies to approximately 508 : 1.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe probability of being dealt a flush in a five-card poker hand is \\boxed{\\frac{1277}{649740}} or approximately 0.00197, which is about 0.197%."
