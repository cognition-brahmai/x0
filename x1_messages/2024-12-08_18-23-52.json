        "content": "Let's see. The office building uses 20,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity each month, and the cost per kWh is $0.12. I need to find out the annual cost of electricity for this building.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the monthly cost. That should be the electricity usage per month multiplied by the cost per kWh. So, that's 20,000 kWh times $0.12 per kWh.\n\nLet me calculate that: 20,000 \u00d7 0.12 = 2,400. So, the monthly cost is $2,400.\n\nNow, to find the annual cost, I need to multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year, right?\n\nSo, annual cost = monthly cost \u00d7 12 = $2,400 \u00d7 12.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 2,400 \u00d7 12.\n\nWell, 2,400 \u00d7 10 = 24,000, and 2,400 \u00d7 2 = 4,800. So, 24,000 + 4,800 = 28,800.\n\nTherefore, the annual cost of electricity for the office building is $28,800.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nElectricity usage per month: 20,000 kWh\n\nCost per kWh: $0.12\n\nMonthly cost: 20,000 \u00d7 0.12 = $2,400\n\nNumber of months in a year: 12\n\nAnnual cost: 2,400 \u00d7 12 = $28,800\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the annual electricity usage first and then multiply by the cost per kWh.\n\nAnnual electricity usage: 20,000 kWh/month \u00d7 12 months = 240,000 kWh\n\nThen, annual cost: 240,000 kWh \u00d7 $0.12/kWh = $28,800\n\nSame result. Good, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the annual cost of electricity for the office building is $28,800.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28800} \\]"
