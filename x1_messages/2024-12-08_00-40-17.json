        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a hotel chain with 500 hotels, each having an average of 100 rooms. That means there are a total of 500 * 100 = 50,000 rooms across the entire chain.\n\nCurrently, the occupancy rate is 75%, which means that 75% of these rooms are occupied on average each night. So, the number of occupied rooms per night is 50,000 * 0.75 = 37,500 rooms.\n\nThe average room rate is $150 per night. Therefore, the current nightly revenue is 37,500 rooms * $150 = $5,625,000.\n\nSince there are 365 days in a year (we'll ignore leap years for simplicity), the annual revenue is $5,625,000 * 365 = $2,043,750,000.\n\nThe company wants to increase its revenue by 10% without adding new properties or significantly increasing marketing efforts. So, the target annual revenue is $2,043,750,000 * 1.10 = $2,248,125,000.\n\nNow, we need to find the target occupancy rate and room rate that will achieve this target revenue.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- New occupancy rate as O (in decimal form)\n\n- New average room rate as R (in dollars)\n\nThe new nightly revenue would be:\n\n50,000 rooms * O * R = Target nightly revenue\n\nFirst, we need to find the target nightly revenue that corresponds to the target annual revenue.\n\nTarget annual revenue: $2,248,125,000\n\nTarget nightly revenue: $2,248,125,000 / 365 \u2248 $6,159,246.58\n\nSo, we have:\n\n50,000 * O * R \u2248 $6,159,246.58\n\nWe have two variables here, O and R, so we need another equation or to make an assumption to solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nOne approach is to assume that the relationship between occupancy rate and room rate follows a demand curve, where higher room rates lead to lower occupancy rates and vice versa. However, without specific data on the price elasticity of demand for the\u9152\u5e97's rooms, it's challenging to model this relationship accurately.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the hotel can adjust both occupancy and room rates simultaneously to achieve the target revenue. But to simplify, perhaps we can consider scenarios where either the occupancy rate or the room rate is held constant, or where both are adjusted proportionally.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a few scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: Keep the occupancy rate the same**\n\nIf the occupancy rate remains at 75%, what should the new room rate be to achieve the target nightly revenue?\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n50,000 * 0.75 * R = $6,159,246.58\n\n37,500 * R = $6,159,246.58\n\nR \u2248 $6,159,246.58 / 37,500 \u2248 $164.27\n\nSo, the room rate would need to increase to approximately $164.27 from $150, which is an increase of about ($164.27 - $150) / $150 \u2248 9.51%, which is less than the 10% revenue increase target. Wait, that seems off because if occupancy stays the same and room rate increases by approximately 9.51%, revenue would increase by about the same percentage, but the target is 10%. Maybe I need to check my calculations.\n\nWait, $164.27 - $150 = $14.27\n\n$14.27 / $150 \u2248 9.51%\n\nBut 9.51% is slightly less than 10%. Maybe to achieve exactly 10%, the room rate needs to be slightly higher.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the exact required room rate:\n\nCurrent nightly revenue: $5,625,000\n\nTarget nightly revenue: $5,625,000 * 1.10 = $6,187,500\n\nSo, 37,500 rooms * R = $6,187,500\n\nR = $6,187,500 / 37,500 = $165\n\nSo, the room rate needs to increase to $165 to achieve a 10% revenue increase with occupancy held constant at 75%.\n\n**Scenario 2: Keep the room rate the same**\n\nIf the room rate remains at $150, what occupancy rate is needed to achieve the target nightly revenue?\n\n50,000 * O * $150 = $6,187,500\n\n50,000 * O = $6,187,500 / $150 = 41,250\n\nO = 41,250 / 50,000 = 0.825 or 82.5%\n\nSo, the occupancy rate would need to increase from 75% to 82.5% to achieve a 10% revenue increase with the room rate held constant.\n\n**Scenario 3: Adjust both occupancy rate and room rate**\n\nIn reality, hotels often adjust both occupancy and room rates to maximize revenue. This is typically done through revenue management strategies, which involve pricing rooms based on demand, day of the week, time of year, and other factors.\n\nTo model this, we can assume that there is a relationship between room rate and occupancy rate. Generally, increasing the room rate may lead to a decrease in occupancy rate, and vice versa.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the percentage change in occupancy rate is proportional to the percentage change in room rate, based on the price elasticity of demand.\n\nHowever, without specific data on the price elasticity, we can\u2019t model this precisely. For simplicity, let\u2019s assume that for every 1% increase in room rate, occupancy rate decreases by a certain percentage.\n\nAlternatively, we can set up an equation with two variables and solve for one in terms of the other.\n\nWe have:\n\n50,000 * O * R = $6,187,500\n\nO * R = $6,187,500 / 50,000 = $123.75\n\nSo, O = $123.75 / R\n\nThis equation shows the relationship between O and R needed to achieve the target revenue.\n\nNow, to find specific values, we need to make assumptions about how O and R are related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the product of occupancy rate and room rate should increase by 10% to achieve the revenue increase.\n\nCurrent O * R = 0.75 * $150 = $112.50\n\nTarget O * R = $123.75\n\nSo, the product needs to increase from $112.50 to $123.75, which is a ($123.75 - $112.50)/$112.50 = 10% increase, as required.\n\nNow, there are multiple combinations of O and R that can achieve this product. For example:\n\n- If O increases by x%, R can decrease by y% such that (1 + x/100)(1 - y/100) = 1.10, considering the relationship between O and R.\n\nBut without more specific data on how O and R are related, it's challenging to pinpoint exact values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hotel can implement a strategy where room rates are increased during high-demand periods and decreased during low-demand periods, which could potentially increase the average room rate and occupancy rate.\n\nFor instance, during peak seasons, rooms could be priced higher to take advantage of greater demand, and during off-peak seasons, rooms could be priced lower to attract more guests.\n\nThis approach is common in revenue management and can help maximize revenue without significantly increasing marketing efforts.\n\nMoreover, the hotel can consider implementing a dynamic pricing strategy, where room rates are adjusted in real-time based on current demand, competitor pricing, and other factors.\n\nTo implement such strategies, the hotel would need to:\n\n1. **Analyze historical data:** Understand past booking patterns, seasonal trends, and how room rates have affected occupancy.\n\n2. **Monitor competitor pricing:** Keep track of what competitors are charging to ensure competitiveness.\n\n3. **Use revenue management software:** Implement tools that can help predict demand and optimize pricing accordingly.\n\n4. **Train staff:** Ensure that front desk and reservation staff are trained in revenue management principles and can make informed decisions.\n\n5. **Test and adjust:** Continuously monitor the results of pricing changes and adjust strategies as needed.\n\nIn conclusion, to achieve a 10% revenue increase without adding new properties or significantly increasing marketing efforts, the hotel chain could aim to increase its average room rate to $165 while keeping occupancy constant at 75%, or increase occupancy to 82.5% while keeping the room rate at $150, or find a balance between the two by adjusting prices based on demand through revenue management strategies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{O = 82.5\\%, \\ R = \\$165} \\]"
