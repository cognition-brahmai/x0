        "content": "Let's see. So, John can paint a house in 5 days, and Jane can do it in 4 days. I need to find out how long it will take them to paint the house together.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how much of the house each of them can paint in one day. That might help me understand their combined effort.\n\nSo, John can paint the whole house in 5 days. That means, in one day, he can paint 1/5 of the house. Similarly, Jane can paint the whole house in 4 days, so in one day, she can paint 1/4 of the house.\n\nNow, if they work together, their efforts should add up. So, in one day, together, they can paint 1/5 plus 1/4 of the house.\n\nLet me calculate that. To add 1/5 and 1/4, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20. So, 1/5 is 4/20, and 1/4 is 5/20. Adding them up, they can paint 9/20 of the house in one day.\n\nSo, if they can paint 9/20 of the house in one day, how many days will it take them to paint the whole house?\n\nI think I need to divide the whole house (which is 1) by the portion they can paint in one day (which is 9/20). So, 1 divided by 9/20 is the same as 1 multiplied by 20/9, which is 20/9 days.\n\n20/9 days is approximately 2.222 days. But I should check if there's a better way to express this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the combined rate. John's rate is 1/5 per day, Jane's rate is 1/4 per day, so together their rate is 1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20 per day, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, time is equal to the total work divided by the rate. The total work is 1 house, so time is 1 divided by 9/20, which is 20/9 days.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for combined work rates: if one person can do a job in A days and another in B days, working together they can do it in (A*B)/(A+B) days.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, A is 5 and B is 4. So, (5*4)/(5+4) = 20/9 days, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, it seems like the answer is 20/9 days, or approximately 2.222 days.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I can think about it differently.\n\nLet's assume the house requires a certain amount of work to be painted, say, 20 units. I chose 20 because it's a common multiple of 5 and 4.\n\nSo, if the house is 20 units, John can paint it in 5 days, meaning he paints 4 units per day (since 20 divided by 5 is 4). Jane can paint it in 4 days, meaning she paints 5 units per day (20 divided by 4 is 5).\n\nTogether, they paint 4 + 5 = 9 units per day.\n\nSo, to paint 20 units, it will take them 20 divided by 9 days, which is again 20/9 days.\n\nThis confirms my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how much of the house they paint together each day. As I did earlier, 1/5 plus 1/4 is 9/20 per day.\n\nSo, yes, it seems definite that the answer is 20/9 days.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any overlap in their work or if they get in each other's way, but the problem doesn't suggest any such complications, so I'll assume their efforts are perfectly complementary.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any units or conversions I need to worry about, but since everything is in days and the house is considered a single unit of work, I think I'm good.\n\nSo, the final answer is 20/9 days, which can also be expressed as 2 days and 2/9 of a day. If needed, 2/9 of a day is approximately 4.888 hours, so roughly 2 days and 4 hours and 53 minutes, but I think 20/9 days is the most precise answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{20}{9} \\text{ days}} \\]"
