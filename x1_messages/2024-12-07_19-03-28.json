        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with marbles of different colors: 4 blue, 3 green, and 5 red. So in total, there are 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 marbles in the bag. The question is, if you draw two marbles at random without replacement, what's the probability that both marbles will be red.\n\nAlright, probability problems can sometimes trip me up, but let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what it means to draw two marbles without replacement. That means once I draw the first marble, I don't put it back into the bag before drawing the second one. So, the total number of marbles decreases after the first draw.\n\nOkay, so the probability of both marbles being red means that the first marble I draw is red and the second one is also red. Since the draws are dependent (because of no replacement), I need to calculate the probability of both events happening in sequence.\n\nLet me recall the formula for dependent events. The probability of both events A and B happening is the probability of A happening multiplied by the probability of B happening given that A has already happened. In this case, event A is drawing a red marble first, and event B is drawing another red marble second, given that the first one was red.\n\nSo, P(both red) = P(first red) * P(second red | first red)\n\nFirst, I need to find P(first red). There are 5 red marbles out of a total of 12 marbles, so P(first red) = 5/12.\n\nNext, P(second red | first red). If the first marble drawn was red, then there are now 4 red marbles left and a total of 11 marbles remaining in the bag (since we didn't replace the first marble). So, P(second red | first red) = 4/11.\n\nNow, multiply these two probabilities together:\n\nP(both red) = (5/12) * (4/11)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply the numerators: 5 * 4 = 20\n\nThen, multiply the denominators: 12 * 11 = 132\n\nSo, P(both red) = 20/132\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\n132 \u00f7 4 = 33\n\nSo, P(both red) = 5/33\n\nWait, but I should check if this is the lowest terms. 5 and 33 have no common factors other than 1, so yes, 5/33 is the simplified form.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem using combinations. Since the order doesn't matter (we just need two red marbles), I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red marbles out of 5 is C(5,2), and the number of ways to choose any 2 marbles out of 12 is C(12,2). So, P(both red) = C(5,2) / C(12,2)\n\nLet me calculate that to verify.\n\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = (5*4*3!) / (2*1 * 3!) = (20) / 2 = 10\n\nC(12,2) = 12! / (2! * (12-2)!) = (12*11*10!) / (2*1 * 10!)} = (132) / 2 = 66\n\nSo, P(both red) = 10 / 66 = 5/33\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total probability and see if there's any other way to approach this, but I think the two methods I've used cover it thoroughly.\n\nSo, the probability that both marbles drawn are red is 5/33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]"
