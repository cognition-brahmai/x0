        "content": "I think I've got this riddle! So, it's something that builds things up and lays mountains low. That sounds like it can both create and destroy landscapes. It dries up lakes and makes things grow, which suggests it can affect water levels and plant life. Also, it doesn't care about your passing, meaning it's indifferent to human life, and it's everlasting, so it's timeless. Hmm, could it be time itself? Time builds civilizations and erodes mountains over eons. It can dry up lakes through evaporation and cause things to grow by allowing time for development. It's also indifferent to individual lives and is eternal. Yeah, I think that fits all the clues. So, my answer is time."
