        "content": "So the factory makes 1200 widgets every day, and unfortunately, 5% of those are defective. That means they have to get rid of the defective ones and sell only the good ones, packed in groups of 10. I need to figure out how many such packs they can sell.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many widgets are defective. If 5% are defective, then the number of defective widgets is 5% of 1200. To calculate that, I can multiply 1200 by 5% or 0.05.\n\nSo, defective widgets = 1200 * 0.05 = 60 widgets.\n\nNow, the total number of good widgets is the total produced minus the defective ones. That would be 1200 - 60 = 1140 widgets.\n\nThese good widgets are to be sold in packs of 10. To find out how many packs they can make, I need to divide the number of good widgets by 10.\n\nNumber of packs = 1140 / 10 = 114 packs.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, what if there are leftover widgets that don't make a full pack? But in this case, since 1140 is perfectly divisible by 10, there shouldn't be any leftovers.\n\nAlso, I should confirm the percentage calculation. 5% of 1200 is indeed 60, as 1200 divided by 100 is 12, and 12 multiplied by 5 is 60.\n\nSo, the factory discards 60 defective widgets and has 1140 good widgets left. Dividing that by 10 gives us 114 packs.\n\nI think that's the answer: they can sell 114 packs of widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{114} \\]"
