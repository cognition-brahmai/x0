First, I need to calculate the exponent, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction, following the order of operations, often remembered by PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\nSo, starting with the exponent:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow, the expression is (16 - 3 * 5) / (7 + 9)\n\nNext, multiplication:\n\n3 * 5 = 15\n\nSo now it's (16 - 15) / (7 + 9)\n\nThen, subtraction and addition:\n\n16 - 15 = 1\n\n7 + 9 = 16\n\nSo now it's 1 / 16\n\nWhich equals 0.0625\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.0625} \\]"
