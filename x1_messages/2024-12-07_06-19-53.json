        "content": "So there's this puzzle about 100 light bulbs all lined up in a row, and they're all initially off. Then, a person walks down the row and toggles every bulb\u2014turns them on if they're off, and off if they're on. After that, they walk back and toggle every second bulb, then every third bulb on the next pass, and so on, until they've done this 100 times. The question is, how many bulbs are on after the 100th pass?\n\nHmm, this sounds a bit tricky, but let's see if I can figure it out. So, to start, we have 100 bulbs, all off. On the first pass, the person toggles every bulb, which means they all get turned on because they were all off to begin with.\n\nNow, on the second pass, they toggle every second bulb. So, bulbs 2, 4, 6, up to 100 will be toggled again. Since they were turned on on the first pass, toggling them again would turn them off. So after the second pass, bulbs 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 are off, and bulbs 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 are on.\n\nOn the third pass, every third bulb gets toggled. So, bulbs 3, 6, 9, up to 99. Now, bulbs 3, 9, 15, etc., were on before this pass, so toggling them would turn them off. Bulbs 6, 12, 18, etc., were turned off on the second pass, so toggling them again would turn them on.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to find a pattern here.\n\nLet me think differently. Each bulb is toggled based on the passes. Specifically, bulb number n is toggled on every pass where the pass number is a divisor of n. For example, bulb 6 is toggled on pass 1, pass 2, pass 3, and pass 6.\n\nSo, the number of times a bulb is toggled is equal to the number of divisors it has. If a bulb is toggled an odd number of times, it will be on at the end, because it starts off, and each toggle switches its state.\n\nTherefore, the bulbs that are on after the 100th pass are those that have been toggled an odd number of times, which corresponds to bulbs with an odd number of divisors.\n\nNow, which numbers have an odd number of divisors? Let's think about that.\n\nMost numbers have divisors in pairs. For example, 6 has divisors 1 and 6, 2 and 3. So, an even number of divisors. But perfect squares have an odd number of divisors because one of the divisors is repeated. For example, 9 has divisors 1, 3, and 9.\n\nSo, perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nTherefore, the bulbs that are on after the 100th pass are those whose numbers are perfect squares.\n\nNow, how many perfect squares are there between 1 and 100?\n\nWell, 1^2 = 1\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n6^2 = 36\n\n7^2 = 49\n\n8^2 = 64\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n10^2 = 100\n\nSo, there are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n\nTherefore, after the 100th pass, 10 bulbs are on.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nWe have bulbs 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100 that are on, because their numbers are perfect squares and thus have been toggled an odd number of times.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 10 bulbs are on after the 100th pass.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
