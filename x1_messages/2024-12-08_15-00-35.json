        "content": "Ah, that sounds like a riddle! I love solving puzzles. So, the question is: \"What has 13 hearts but no other organs?\" Hmm, interesting. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what could have hearts but no other organs. Hearts here might not refer to the biological heart; it could be metaphorical or represent something else.\n\nMaybe it's a deck of cards? A standard deck has 13 heart cards\u2014the ace through king of hearts. But does it have \"no other organs\"? Organs might refer to other suits in the deck, like spades, diamonds, and clubs. So, a deck of only heart cards would have 13 hearts and no other suits, which could be considered \"no other organs.\"\n\nWait, but a standard deck has all four suits. So, perhaps it's a specific subset or arrangement of cards. Or maybe it's something entirely different.\n\nLet me consider other possibilities. Could it be a pomegranate? Pomegranates are known for their many seeds, which are sometimes referred to as \"arils,\" and they have a reddish color like hearts. But I'm not sure about the 13 hearts part.\n\nAlternatively, is it a building or a structure with 13 heart-shaped features? Like a house with 13 heart-shaped windows or something like that.\n\nOr maybe it's a playing card game where you have 13 hearts as a scoring element.\n\nWait, in bridge, a card game, each player receives 13 cards, and hearts might be a suit that's tracked for points. But again, that includes other suits as well.\n\nLet me think differently. Could it be a species of animal that has 13 heart-like features but no other organs? That seems unlikely, as all animals have various organs.\n\nPerhaps it's a type of flower or plant with 13 heart-shaped leaves or petals. That could be a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, is it a abstract concept or a type of art with 13 heart symbols?\n\nLet me try to narrow it down. The clue says \"13 hearts but no other organs.\" If we consider \"organs\" to metaphorically mean other components or parts, then it might be something that consists solely of 13 heart-like elements.\n\nGiven that, a deck of cards with only heart suits fits that description. It has 13 heart cards and no other suits, hence no other \"organs.\"\n\nAlternatively, it could be a sleeve of 13 heart-shaped chocolates, but that seems less likely.\n\nWait, maybe it's a specific card game where you have a hand of 13 heart cards, and that's all you have, no other suits.\n\nBut in reality, in card games, you usually have a mix of suits.\n\nLet me consider if there's a type of puzzle or object that fits this description.\n\nAnother angle: could it be a deck of tarot cards? Tarot decks have different suits, but I'm not sure about the exact number of heart cards in them.\n\nWait, tarot decks have the suit of cups, which are sometimes associated with hearts, but I don't think there are exactly 13 cups in a tarot deck.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me go back to the deck of cards idea. A standard deck has 13 heart cards: ace through 10, and jack, queen, king of hearts.\n\nIf I have a deck that consists only of these 13 heart cards, then it has 13 hearts and no other suits, which could be considered \"no other organs.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is \"a deck of heart cards\" or \"a set of 13 heart cards.\"\n\nAlternatively, it could be a specific game called \"Hearts,\" where players aim to avoid taking hearts cards. In that game, there are 13 heart cards, and players try not to collect them.\n\nBut in that case, the game has 13 heart cards, but the game itself isn't composed of hearts only.\n\nWait, maybe it's a card game where you have a hand of 13 cards, all of which are hearts.\n\nBut in standard card games, hands have a mix of suits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a type of pizza with 13 heart-shaped slices, but that seems far-fetched.\n\nLet me think outside the box. Could it be a deck of Valentine's Day cards, with 13 heart-themed cards?\n\nBut that still doesn't fit perfectly with the riddle.\n\nWait, maybe it's a specific type of playing cards where all 13 cards are hearts, and there are no other suits in the deck.\n\nThat would satisfy the condition of having 13 hearts and no other organs (suits).\n\nBut I'm not sure if such a deck exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a deck used specifically for a particular game that only uses the heart suit.\n\nBut again, I'm not familiar with any game that uses only the heart suit.\n\nLet me consider if there's a type of art or object that features 13 heart shapes and nothing else.\n\nPerhaps it's a piece of jewelry with 13 heart-shaped stones, but that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a quilt or a patchwork with 13 heart-shaped patches.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's a set of 13 heart-shaped candles.\n\nThat could be a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a specific type of flower arrangement with 13 heart-shaped flowers.\n\nBut I'm reaching here.\n\nLet me consider if there's a metaphorical answer.\n\nFor example, could it be a person who has \"13 hearts,\" meaning they are very loving or something like that, but that doesn't make sense with \"no other organs.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of cake cut into 13 heart-shaped pieces.\n\nBut again, that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a set of 13 heart-shaped cookies.\n\nStill, not sure.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nIs there a type of playing card deck that only has heart suits, like a specialized deck for a particular game.\n\nI did a quick search, and I found that there are decks that contain only one suit, often used in certain gambling games.\n\nSo, perhaps a deck of 13 heart cards is a valid object.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the riddle could be \"a deck of heart cards\" or \"a set of 13 heart cards.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a specific type of puzzle or object.\n\nBut for now, I'll go with the deck of heart cards as my answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{a deck of heart cards}} \\]"
