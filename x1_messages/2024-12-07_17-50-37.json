        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 10 marbles: 6 are green and 4 are yellow. I'm supposed to draw 3 marbles without replacement, and I need to find the probability that exactly 2 of them are green and 1 is yellow.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a marble, it stays out of the bag, so the total number of marbles decreases with each draw. That affects the probabilities for the subsequent draws.\n\nOkay, so the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles out of 10. I think that's a combination problem because the order doesn't matter here. The number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 10 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number, and \\( k \\) is the number of choices. So, for the total number of ways:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10 - 3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3! \\cdot 7!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify that by canceling out the 7! in the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to draw 3 marbles from 10.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to draw exactly 2 green and 1 yellow marble. There are 6 green marbles and 4 yellow marbles.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose 2 green marbles out of 6:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6 - 2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose 1 yellow marble out of 4:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 1) = \\frac{4!}{1!(4 - 1)!} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of ways to choose 2 green and 1 yellow is the product of the two combinations:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 4 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 60 favorable outcomes.\n\nFinally, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 2 green and 1 yellow}) = \\frac{60}{120} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems too high. Is there a mistake here?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal ways to choose 3 marbles from 10:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = 120 \\quad \\text{seems correct.}\n\\]\n\nWays to choose 2 green from 6:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = 15 \\quad \\text{correct.}\n\\]\n\nWays to choose 1 yellow from 4:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 1) = 4 \\quad \\text{correct.}\n\\]\n\nProduct is 15 \u00d7 4 = 60, which is the number of favorable outcomes. So, probability is 60/120 = 0.5.\n\nHmm, but intuitively, with more green marbles, getting at least 2 green seems likely, but exactly 2 might be less than half. Maybe I need to consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the probability step by step, considering the draws one at a time without replacement.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe sequence could be: green, green, yellow; or green, yellow, green; or yellow, green, green.\n\nI need to calculate the probability for each sequence and then add them up.\n\nFirst sequence: green, green, yellow.\n\nProbability of first marble being green:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{10} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nGiven that the first was green, there are now 5 green and 4 yellow left, total 9 marbles.\n\nProbability of second marble being green:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{9} \\approx 0.5556\n\\]\n\nGiven that the first two were green, there are now 4 green and 4 yellow left, total 8 marbles.\n\nProbability of third marble being yellow:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{8} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is:\n\n\\[\n0.6 \\times 0.5556 \\times 0.5 = 0.1667\n\\]\n\nNow, second sequence: green, yellow, green.\n\nProbability of first marble being green:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{10} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nGiven that the first was green, there are now 5 green and 4 yellow left, total 9 marbles.\n\nProbability of second marble being yellow:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{9} \\approx 0.4444\n\\]\n\nGiven that one green and one yellow have been drawn, there are now 5 green and 3 yellow left, total 8 marbles.\n\nWait, no: wait, after drawing one green and one yellow, it should be 5 green and 3 yellow left, total 8 marbles.\n\nProbability of third marble being green:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8} = 0.625\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is:\n\n\\[\n0.6 \\times 0.4444 \\times 0.625 \\approx 0.1667\n\\]\n\nThird sequence: yellow, green, green.\n\nProbability of first marble being yellow:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{10} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nGiven that the first was yellow, there are now 6 green and 3 yellow left, total 9 marbles.\n\nProbability of second marble being green:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{9} \\approx 0.6667\n\\]\n\nGiven that one yellow and one green have been drawn, there are now 5 green and 3 yellow left, total 8 marbles.\n\nProbability of third marble being green:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8} = 0.625\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is:\n\n\\[\n0.4 \\times 0.6667 \\times 0.625 \\approx 0.1667\n\\]\n\nNow, adding up the probabilities of these three sequences:\n\n\\[\n0.1667 + 0.1667 + 0.1667 = 0.5\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 0.5, or 50%.\n\nBut maybe I should consider another method to confirm.\n\nLet me think about using binomial coefficients directly in probability.\n\nThe formula for hypergeometric distribution, since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\frac{C(K, k) \\times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the population size (10 marbles),\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (6 green marbles),\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of draws (3 marbles),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (2 green marbles).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\frac{C(6, 2) \\times C(4, 1)}{C(10, 3)} = \\frac{15 \\times 4}{120} = \\frac{60}{120} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nAgain, 0.5.\n\nHmm, maybe this is correct after all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the proportions.\n\nThe proportion of green marbles is 6/10 = 0.6.\n\nSo, the expected number of green marbles in 3 draws would be 3 * 0.6 = 1.8.\n\nSo, around 2 green marbles is reasonable.\n\nAnd the probability of exactly 2 green and 1 yellow being 50% seems plausible now.\n\nI think my initial intuition was wrong, and the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.5, or 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]"
