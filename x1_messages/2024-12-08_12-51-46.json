Find out how to prepare your investments for the worst. Joining me today, on IN THE MONEY, a couple of the regulars on the program, CNN correspondent, Susan Lisovicz and \"Fortune\" magazine editor-at-large, Andy Serwer. Being the father of four, count \\'em, four daughters I was shocked on Friday when the president and first lady announced they would not be attending their daughter\\'s graduations, one from Texas and one from Princeton. I mean, I\\'d be thrown out of the house without even subway fare if I\\'d said I wasn\\'t going to one of those kid\\'s graduations. What\\'s up with that? SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the president said that he did not want thousands of proud parents and family members to have to go through metal detectors as surely they would when any president is in attendance and I bought that hook, line, and sinker. But, you seem to have a different view, Jack? ANDREW SERWER, \"FORTUNE\" MAGAZINE: I guess they don\\'t want the president there in front of all the signs that say Bush is a bad guy and all that. I think that\\'s where Jack is going. It\\'s Yale, I think, instead of Princeton, by the way. CAFFERTY: Oh, is it? SERWER: One of the Ivy League joints. CAFFERTY: I get them confused. LISOVICZ: His al matador. CAFFERTY: They all look alike. SERWER: But, you know, it is tough being a presidential family, I guess. I mean, think about Chelsea Clinton and Amy Carter and, you know, you wear weird clothes to school and the press corps is all over you. But, I mean here, I think the president\\'s to buck up and go to these graduations. This is an important moment for the kids, and I mean, family\\'s important. Right?. CAFFERTY: Well, and their -- you know, if they\\'re micromanaging this behind the scenes so as to avoid anybody holding a sign to disagree with the president\\'s position on something, that\\'s kind of silly, I mean, it\\'s his daughter\\'s graduation. LISOVICZ: And he\\'s not speaking. CAFFERTY: No. And besides, I mean wouldn\\'t the classmates -- I mean, I -- if somebody told me that the president was coming to my daughter\\'s graduation, I think that would be pretty cool. I\\'d say, that\\'s neat, the president of the United States -- I don\\'t think people mind going through a metal detector in order to get to -- anyway. SERWER: Family values, right? CAFFERTY: Yeah. SERWER: Family values. CAFFERTY: Family values. SERWER: Yep. CAFFERTY: All right. For a lot of the voters, the presidential race poses a couple of big questions these days. One is why George W. Bush has been doing as well as he has been in the polls given the trouble facing the White House. And the other is why John Kerry isn\\'t doing any better than he is. Let\\'s check the Kerry campaign report card as we bring in Ron Brownstein of the \"Los Angeles Times.\" He\\'s a CNN political analyst and he joins us from Washington, D.C. Ron, nice to have you with us, thanks for joining us. RON BROWNSTEIN, \"LOS ANGELES TIMES\": Thanks for having me. Besides being the un-Bush, what has John Kerry done to define himself to the electorate? He\\'s not having much of an impact, so far. BROWNSTEIN: Well, he\\'s had very mixed success at defining himself since coming into the democratic nomination in March. He has done a few things that could matter later on; he has raised a lot of money and enabling himself to go on the air to a degree that really no challenger has before and Jack, he\\'s also started to reposition himself, I think, as the democratic primaries really tilted to the left, that kind of populous, remember the Benedict Arnold corporations on a variety of fronts, fiscal discipline, talking about adding more troops to the military, not leaving Iraq, this week, with some education reform proposals. Trying to move himself more towards the center, but he is in the position that is common for challengers before their own convention. They have a tough time telling a coherent and sustained story to the American public and they are sort of an afterthought, especially when you have big events like we have now dominating the news. LISOVICZ: When you say that John Kerry is now repositioning himself, but what most Americans are seeing is this $25 million ad campaign that talks about John Kerry\\'s life. Look, if you\\'re voting for the president of the only super power in the world, you want to know what his ideas are. Is that, in your view, a mistake? BROWNSTEIN: No, I actually disagree a little bit, I think that if you look back, the first challenge for the challenger and remember, we\\'re talking about the candidate who is -- you know, challenging the incumbent president, is to convince people that they have a sense of understanding of what their lives are like, they have experiences that will bring them in touch with ordinary folks\\' lives, and especially now that they have the qualifications to be commander-in-chief. I mean, if you go back and you look, whether Ronald Reagan in 1980 or Bill Clinton in 1992, both won pretty decisive victories, they were trailing at this point, largely because people had very shallow impressions of them. This ad campaign is not going to solve John Kerry\\'s problems. It will really take the convention, I think, to begin to introduce him to the country. But, as long as Bush stays right around 50 percent in his approval rates, some polls slightly under, some polls slightly above, Kerry will be in the game and you saw that in your latest CNN poll this week. Bush went down, Kerry went up. SERWER: Ron, is it just me or are democrats just lousy campaigners? I mean, you take away Bill Clinton and the democrats have always done a very good job of bumbling campaigns. Are the republicans simply better at this process? BROWNSTEIN: That\\'s a good question. Look, John Kerry -- no one will say -- I don\\'t think any democrat\\'s going to say John Kerry is the most electric campaigner in the world. There are issues that are arising about him that could be important later. Does he connect well with average voters? Can he crystallize a short terse coherent message? I would just say it\\'s early to make these judgments. Until we see him having an opportunity to really tell his story to the country which, as I say, for the challenger usually comes at the convention, it\\'s hard to know how strong he will be. The evidence, Andy, is that when you have an incumbent president, the race revolves more around the incumbent president than the challenger. There was doubts about Bill Clinton in \\'92 or Ronald Reagan in \\'80 or Jimmy Carter in \\'76, and voters because they were relatively certain they didn\\'t want the incumbent for another four years. That\\'s the -- that\\'s sort of the marker that I keep my eye on more. Where is Bush\\'s approval, what is the sense of whether we\\'re on the right or wrong track and those -- you know, measures point us toward a pretty close race. CAFFERTY: How much of the problem that John Kerry has is because of the republicans and if fact they got on television early with some very hard-hitting ads that called Kerry a flip-flopper on the issues, voted against the money for the war in Iraq, voted against body armor for our troops, I mean really though stuff, and more importantly, not so much what the republicans did early, but the fact that the Kerry campaign didn\\'t do anything to respond right away? BROWNSTEIN: Right. Well they were -- Jack, you know, they were in a difficult situation. They exhausted themselves financially, physically, and emotionally winning the democratic primary and you had the Bush campaign that had been waiting two years for whoever came out, as the democratic winner, to go after them with this extraordinary bankroll that they had -- they had put together, so they did not respond quickly. But, what they have been able to do, I think because we have such a polarized electorate, in which there is a lot of enthusiasm on both sides, they have been able to raise much more money than anybody expected and come back on the air, now, with a very large ad buy. That Bush ad buy from early March to mid April, was larger than the total amount of money he or Al Gore spent from the convention through the general election last year and you could say, well, John Kerry isn\\'t doing better, given the bad news in the world, you could say George Bush spent an unprecedented sum to get a knockout and didn\\'t get it, so really, they\\'re both kind of not as strong as they might be, but they are in a very competitive situation. LISOVICZ: Right. And right now the president is clearly vulnerable, as you mentioned, Ron, with the latest poll numbers. How important is it for John Kerry to be both -- keep the high road but yet, to take advantage of this opportunity? BROWNSTEIN: Well, I believe -- I mean, I\\'m a believer that the challenger is a secondary factor in a race with an incumbent; it\\'s primarily going to be about George Bush. What Kerry has to do is make himself acceptable to voters disposed to want a change. But, you\\'re right, the challenge, especially on Iraq, is a difficult one. On the one hand, you don\\'t want be -- seem to be undermining the commander- in-chief, much less the troops in the field, at a time when most Americans want this to succeed, on the other hand, you have to find a way to tap into the doubts that do exist, the polls tell us, in the public about whether this is succeeding, whether Bush has a clear plan, especially adding to the pressure on Kerry is the fact the Ralph Nader is now out there as an opponent to the war, basically giving himself a rational for the candidacy that he didn\\'t have and putting pressure on the left. I do think that if things continue to go badly in Iraq, Kerry will feel pressure to more shapely delineate himself from Bush and perhaps begin to talk about ways of reducing the American commitment, something he hasn\\'t done at all, to this point. CAFFERTY: Quick last question, Ron. We\\'re about out of time. Historically, elections are decided on the economy, people vote their wallet when they go to vote for a president, in partial. The economic news is starting to break the president\\'s way -- 600,000 jobs in the last two months based on numbers that came out last Friday. If the economy continues to expand and grow, I mean, jobs continue to appear, is the problem in this country, over the war in Iraq enough of an issue, to get John Kerry elected, if he doesn\\'t have the economy to run on? BROWNSTEIN: You know, if the Red Sox or Yankees are going to win a World Series? CAFFERTY: Come on, Ron. BROWNSTEIN: Yeah. I mean, that\\'s that right question. I mean, you tell me -- look, I believe events outweigh arguments in presidential politics, especially when you have an incumbent. And I think that with the economy perking up, it is likely that the one factor that could beat George Bush is Iraq, and it could do that. I mean, if things continue to go badly, he\\'ll stay, I think, right on brink. You know, Jack, if you look historically, he is -- his approval rating is probably below where it should be, given the trends in the economy and clearly what\\'s holding him down is anxiety about the way things are going in Iraq. That may turn out to be much of a vulnerability, in the end, even though there\\'s a kind of a differential. States like Ohio and Missouri and West Virginia may not recovering as much -- could create some vulnerability there, but I still think in the end, it will be Iraq that will be the central point of vulnerability. CAFFERTY: Ron Brownstein, CNN political analyst, national political correspondent for the \"Los Angels Times,\" thanks very much, Ron. BROWNSTEIN: Thank you. CAFFERTY: All right. Coming up on IN THE MONEY, as we continue: When the big three-oh, is the big huh-oh: For lots of American women, 30 is midlife crisis time, even though actuarially of speaking, it is a long way from midlife.

        "content": "\"IN THE MONEY\" discusses politics, women's midlife crisis at 30, and investment preparation for potential terrorist threats.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo answer this question, I need to summarize the given input, which is a transcript from a show called \"IN THE MONEY.\" The summary should be around 10 words.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points discussed in the transcript. From a quick skim, it seems like the show covers several topics:\n\n1. Politics: There's a discussion about the US presidential race between George W. Bush and John Kerry. They talk about Bush's approval ratings, Kerry's campaign strategies, and the impact of the war in Iraq on the election.\n\n2. Women's Issues: There's a mention of American women experiencing a midlife crisis at age 30, balancing work and personal life.\n\n3. Investments: Preparing investments for potential terrorist threats.\n\nGiven that, I need to condense these points into a 10-word summary. It's challenging because there are multiple topics, but I need to capture the essence of the show.\n\nPerhaps something like: \"Show discusses politics, women's midlife crisis, and investment preparedness.\"\n\nLet me count the words: Show discusses politics, women's midlife crisis, and investment preparedness. That's 9 words, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I could make it: \"IN THE MONEY covers politics, women's issues, and investments.\"\n\nThat's 7 words, but it's more concise. However, \"women's issues\" is a bit vague; \"midlife crisis at 30\" is more specific.\n\nAlternatively: \"Program explores politics, women's midlife crisis, and investment readiness.\"\n\nThat's 10 words and captures all key points.\n\nI think that works well. It mentions the show's name, indicates that it explores multiple topics, and specifically names politics, women's midlife crisis at 30, and investment preparation for potential terrorist threats.\n\nWait, in the original instruction, it says \"around 10 words,\" so slight flexibility is allowed. My third option is exactly 10 words, which is perfect.\n\nTherefore, my final summary is: \"Program explores politics, women's midlife crisis, and investment readiness.\"\n\n## Final Solution\n\"Program explores politics, women's midlife crisis, and investment readiness.\""
