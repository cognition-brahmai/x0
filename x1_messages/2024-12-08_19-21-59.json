        "content": "Let's see. Peter earns $15 per hour. He works 8 hours a day, and 5 days a week. We need to find out how much he earns in a month, assuming a month has 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate his daily earnings. If he earns $15 per hour and works 8 hours a day, then:\n\nDaily earnings = hourly wage \u00d7 hours per day\n                       = $15 \u00d7 8\n                       = $120\n\nSo, Peter earns $120 each day.\n\nNext, I'll find out his weekly earnings. Since he works 5 days a week:\n\nWeekly earnings = daily earnings \u00d7 days per week\n                        = $120 \u00d7 5\n                        = $600\n\nTherefore, Peter earns $600 each week.\n\nNow, to find his monthly earnings, I'll multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks:\n\nMonthly earnings = weekly earnings \u00d7 weeks per month\n                         = $600 \u00d7 4\n                         = $2,400\n\nSo, Peter earns $2,400 in a month.\n\nWait a minute, but some months have more than 4 weeks. Most months have about 4.33 weeks. But the question assumes a month has 4 weeks, so I'll stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate his monthly earnings based on the actual number of days he works in a month. Let's check that.\n\nIf he works 5 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, that's 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 days per month.\n\nSo, monthly earnings = daily earnings \u00d7 days per month\n                                 = $120 \u00d7 20\n                                 = $2,400\n\nSame result.\n\nAnother way is to calculate his monthly hours worked. He works 8 hours a day for 20 days:\n\nHours per month = 8 \u00d7 20 = 160 hours\n\nThen, monthly earnings = hourly wage \u00d7 hours per month\n                                 = $15 \u00d7 160\n                                 = $2,400\n\nAgain, $2,400.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with $2,400 as his monthly earnings.\n\nBut let me think about this again. Some months might have more days, like 21 or 22 days, but according to the assumption, it's 4 weeks, which is 20 days.\n\nHowever, in reality, most months have around 20-22 working days, but since the question specifies 4 weeks, I'll go with 20 days.\n\nTherefore, Peter earns $2,400 per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]"
