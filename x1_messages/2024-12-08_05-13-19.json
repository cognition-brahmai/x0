        "content": "I'm going to take a stab at this riddle. It seems like it's describing something that has characteristics of being old and new, never sad but sometimes blue, never empty but sometimes full, and never pushes but always pulls. Hmm.\n\nFirst, \"always old, sometimes new.\" That sounds like something that is timeless or has a long history, but can also be updated or renewed. Maybe like a tradition or a tool that's been around for a long time but can be updated with new versions.\n\n\"Never sad, sometimes blue.\" This is interesting. Blue can mean sad in some contexts, but it might also refer to the color blue. So perhaps it's something that isn't emotional, but can have a blue appearance sometimes.\n\n\"Never empty, sometimes full.\" This suggests that it always has some content or presence, but can also be filled more than its usual state.\n\n\"Never pushes, always pulls.\" This could be referring to a physical action, where it doesn't push but instead pulls things towards it.\n\nPutting all these clues together, I'm thinking it might be the ocean or the sea. Let's see:\n\n- Always old: The ocean has existed for millions of years.\n\n- Sometimes new: New water cycles through it, and there are always new discoveries.\n\n- Never sad: It doesn't have emotions.\n\n- Sometimes blue: The ocean is often blue, though it can be other colors depending on the conditions.\n\n- Never empty: It always has water.\n\n- Sometimes full: Tides can make it seem fuller.\n\n- Never pushes, always pulls: Tides pull water towards the shore and pull it back.\n\nThat seems to fit pretty well. Alternatively, it could be the moon, especially with the pulling and pushing related to tides. But the moon can be full and sometimes not, and it does influence tides by pulling on the ocean.\n\nWait, but the moon pulls on the ocean, causing tides, and it doesn't push. So that matches the \"never pushes, always pulls.\" Also, the moon has phases, sometimes full, sometimes not, but it's always there, never empty.\n\n\"Always old, sometimes new:\" The moon has been there for billions of years, and it has phases that can seem new.\n\n\"Never sad, sometimes blue:\" The moon doesn't have emotions, and it can appear blue sometimes, like a \"blue moon.\"\n\n\"Never empty, sometimes full:\" It's always there, and it has full phases.\n\nSo both the ocean and the moon seem plausible. Maybe it's the moon, since it's the one that pulls on the ocean, causing tides.\n\nLet me consider another angle. The riddle says \"never pushes, always pulls.\" That sounds like gravity, which always attracts and never repels.\n\nBut gravity is a general force, not something that is sometimes new or has phases.\n\nWait, maybe it's magnetism. Magnets pull with their attraction and don't push unless another magnet is oriented in a way to repel.\n\nBut magnets can push and pull, depending on polarity.\n\nHmm, maybe not.\n\nLet's think about it differently. \"Never pushes, always pulls\" could refer to something like a pull cord, but that doesn't fit with the other clues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's gravity, but as I thought earlier, gravity can be considered always pulling, but it doesn't fit the other descriptions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's gravity of the moon pulling on the ocean.\n\nBut that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's love, which is often said to be pulling rather than pushing.\n\nBut love can be sad, which doesn't fit \"never sad.\"\n\nMaybe it's gravity, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the ocean again. It fits most of the clues, but \"never sad\" might not apply because the ocean doesn't have emotions, but the riddle says \"never sad.\"\n\nMaybe it's better to think of it as the moon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's time, which is always old, sometimes new (as in new beginnings), never sad, sometimes blue (like \"blue moon\"), never empty, sometimes full (as in full schedules), and never pushes, always pulls (time pulls us forward, we can't push against it).\n\nThat could work, but it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAnother possibility is a well or a spring, which always has water, sometimes more, sometimes less, and pulls water from the ground.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to fit all the clues.\n\nI think I'll stick with the moon as my answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The Moon}} \\]"
