        "content": "So I've got this double integral to evaluate: \u222cR (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dA, where R is the region bounded by the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 9. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that dA is just the area element, which in Cartesian coordinates is dx dy. So, in principle, I could set up iterated integrals over x and y. But looking at the region R, which is a circle of radius 3 centered at the origin, I suspect that polar coordinates might be a better choice here. Polar coordinates often simplify integrals over circular regions.\n\nLet me recall the transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates. We have:\n\nx = r cos \u03b8\n\ny = r sin \u03b8\n\nAnd the area element dA in polar coordinates is r dr d\u03b8. So, substituting x and y in the integrand, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 becomes (r cos \u03b8)\u00b2 + (r sin \u03b8)\u00b2, which simplifies to r\u00b2 (cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8) = r\u00b2 (1) = r\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the integrand x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 in polar coordinates is just r\u00b2, and the integral becomes:\n\n\u222cR r\u00b2 * r dr d\u03b8 = \u222cR r\u00b3 dr d\u03b8\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the integral is now \u222cR r\u00b3 dr d\u03b8.\n\nNow, I need to determine the limits of integration for r and \u03b8 over the region R, which is the circle of radius 3.\n\nIn polar coordinates, \u03b8 ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0 to cover the full circle, and r ranges from 0 to the radius of the circle, which is 3.\n\nSo, the double integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(\u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0) \u222b(r=0 to 3) r\u00b3 dr d\u03b8\n\nThat looks manageable. Let's first integrate with respect to r, treating \u03b8 as a constant.\n\nThe inner integral is \u222b(r=0 to 3) r\u00b3 dr.\n\nI know that the antiderivative of r\u00b3 is (1/4)r\u2074.\n\nSo, evaluating from 0 to 3:\n\n(1/4)(3)^4 - (1/4)(0)^4 = (1/4)(81) - 0 = 81/4\n\nSo, the inner integral gives 81/4.\n\nNow, the outer integral is \u222b(\u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0) (81/4) d\u03b8.\n\nSince 81/4 is a constant with respect to \u03b8, this integral is just (81/4)(2\u03c0 - 0) = (81/4)(2\u03c0) = (81/2)\u03c0\n\nTherefore, the value of the double integral is (81/2)\u03c0.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. Maybe I can verify this result using another method.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up the integral in Cartesian coordinates and see if I get the same answer.\n\nSo, in Cartesian coordinates, the region R is the disk x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 9.\n\nSo, the double integral is \u222cR (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dx dy, where R is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 9.\n\nTo set up iterated integrals, I can integrate first with respect to y and then x, or vice versa.\n\nLet's choose to integrate with respect to y first, then x.\n\nSo, for a fixed x, y ranges from -\u221a(9 - x\u00b2) to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2), since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 9 implies y\u00b2 \u2264 9 - x\u00b2, so y is between -\u221a(9 - x\u00b2) and \u221a(9 - x\u00b2).\n\nAnd x ranges from -3 to 3, since when y=0, x can be from -3 to 3.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(x=-3 to 3) \u222b(y=-\u221a(9 - x\u00b2) to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2)) (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dy dx\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but let's try to evaluate it.\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to y:\n\n\u222b(y=-\u221a(9 - x\u00b2) to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2)) (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dy\n\nSince x is treated as a constant here, this is:\n\nx\u00b2 \u222b(y=-\u221a(9 - x\u00b2) to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2)) dy + \u222b(y=-\u221a(9 - x\u00b2) to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2)) y\u00b2 dy\n\nThe first integral is x\u00b2 times the length of the interval from -\u221a(9 - x\u00b2) to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2), which is 2\u221a(9 - x\u00b2).\n\nSo, first part: x\u00b2 * 2\u221a(9 - x\u00b2)\n\nThe second integral is the integral of y\u00b2 from -\u221a(9 - x\u00b2) to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2).\n\nSince y\u00b2 is even in y, this is twice the integral from 0 to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2) of y\u00b2 dy.\n\nSo, \u222b(y=0 to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2)) y\u00b2 dy = (1/3)y\u00b3 | from 0 to \u221a(9 - x\u00b2) = (1/3)(9 - x\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nTherefore, the second part is 2 * (1/3)(9 - x\u00b2)^(3/2) = (2/3)(9 - x\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nSo, the inner integral is:\n\n2x\u00b2 \u221a(9 - x\u00b2) + (2/3)(9 - x\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, the outer integral is:\n\n\u222b(x=-3 to 3) [2x\u00b2 \u221a(9 - x\u00b2) + (2/3)(9 - x\u00b2)^(3/2)] dx\n\nThis looks quite complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use symmetry. Since the integrand x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is symmetric with respect to both x and y, maybe I can exploit this symmetry to simplify the integral.\n\nAlso, I recall that in polar coordinates, the integral was much simpler. Maybe sticking with polar coordinates was the better choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is the square of the distance from the origin, and perhaps there's a geometric interpretation or formula that can be applied here.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that the average value of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 over the disk of radius 3 is equal to the integral of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 over the disk divided by the area of the disk.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates together. For example, maybe I can express x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 in terms of polar coordinates but keep one variable in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nHmm, that might not be the best approach.\n\nLet me consider another way. Maybe I can split the integral into two parts: the integral of x\u00b2 over R plus the integral of y\u00b2 over R.\n\nSo, \u222cR x\u00b2 dA + \u222cR y\u00b2 dA\n\nNow, due to symmetry, these two integrals are equal, since the region R is symmetric with respect to x and y. So, \u222cR x\u00b2 dA = \u222cR y\u00b2 dA\n\nTherefore, the total integral is 2 \u222cR x\u00b2 dA\n\nNow, perhaps integrating x\u00b2 over R is simpler than integrating x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the moment of inertia. I recall that in physics, the moment of inertia of a lamina with density equal to 1 over a region R is given by \u222cR (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dA, which is exactly the integral I'm trying to evaluate.\n\nIn fact, I think the moment of inertia of a circular disk of radius r about its center is (1/2)mr\u00b2, where m is the mass. But in this case, since the density is 1, m is equal to the area of the disk, which is \u03c0r\u00b2. So, for r=3, m=9\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the moment of inertia I = (1/2)(9\u03c0)(9) = (1/2)(81\u03c0) = (81/2)\u03c0\n\nWait a second, that's exactly the same result I got using polar coordinates.\n\nSo, this seems to confirm that the answer is (81/2)\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the integral in Cartesian coordinates and see if I get the same answer.\n\nSo, going back to the integral:\n\n\u222b(x=-3 to 3) [2x\u00b2 \u221a(9 - x\u00b2) + (2/3)(9 - x\u00b2)^(3/2)] dx\n\nThis still looks quite complicated. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it.\n\nLet me consider x = 3 sin \u03b8 or x = 3 cos \u03b8. Perhaps x = 3 sin \u03b8 would be a good substitution.\n\nLet me set x = 3 sin \u03b8, so dx = 3 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nWhen x = -3, \u03b8 = -\u03c0/2\n\nWhen x = 3, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(\u03b8=-\u03c0/2 to \u03c0/2) [2*(9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8)*\u221a(9 - 9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8) + (2/3)(9 - 9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8)^(3/2)] * 3 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nSimplify inside the integral:\n\nFirst, \u221a(9 - 9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8) = \u221a(9(1 - sin\u00b2 \u03b8)) = \u221a(9 cos\u00b2 \u03b8) = 3 |cos \u03b8| = 3 cos \u03b8, since cos \u03b8 is non-negative for \u03b8 in [-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2]\n\nSo, the first part is 2*(9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8)*(3 cos \u03b8) = 54 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\nThe second part is (2/3)(9 - 9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8)^(3/2) = (2/3)(9 cos\u00b2 \u03b8)^(3/2) = (2/3)(27 cos\u00b3 \u03b8) = 18 cos\u00b3 \u03b8\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(\u03b8=-\u03c0/2 to \u03c0/2) [54 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8 + 18 cos\u00b3 \u03b8] * 3 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the multiplication by dx = 3 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8.\n\nActually, the integrand before multiplying by dx is:\n\n2x\u00b2 \u221a(9 - x\u00b2) + (2/3)(9 - x\u00b2)^(3/2) = 54 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8 + 18 cos\u00b3 \u03b8\n\nThen, multiplying by dx = 3 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8, we get:\n\n[54 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8 + 18 cos\u00b3 \u03b8] * 3 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8 = [162 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + 54 cos\u2074 \u03b8] d\u03b8\n\nThis still looks complicated, but maybe I can simplify it using trigonometric identities.\n\nRecall that sin\u00b2 \u03b8 = (1 - cos 2\u03b8)/2 and cos\u00b2 \u03b8 = (1 + cos 2\u03b8)/2\n\nAlso, cos\u2074 \u03b8 can be expressed using power-reduction formulas.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of cos 2\u03b8.\n\nFirst, sin\u00b2 \u03b8 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 = (sin 2\u03b8)^2 / 4\n\nBecause sin 2\u03b8 = 2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8, so (sin 2\u03b8)^2 = 4 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 cos\u00b2 \u03b8, hence sin\u00b2 \u03b8 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 = (sin 2\u03b8)^2 / 4\n\nSimilarly, cos\u2074 \u03b8 = (cos\u00b2 \u03b8)^2 = [(1 + cos 2\u03b8)/2]^2 = (1 + 2 cos 2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2 2\u03b8)/4\n\nThis seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the substitution u = cos \u03b8 to simplify the integral.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this too hard. Perhaps there's a better way to evaluate the integral in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can switch the order of integration.\n\nWait, perhaps I should stick with the polar coordinates approach, since it gave me a straightforward answer of (81/2)\u03c0, and the moment of inertia approach confirmed it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use geometry. The function x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 represents the square of the distance from the origin. Over the disk of radius 3, the average value of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is (1/area) \u222cR (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dA.\n\nI know that the average distance squared from the center in a disk of radius r is (r\u00b2)/2.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think.\n\nActually, no. The average value of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 over the disk is (1 / area) \u222cR (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dA.\n\nGiven that area is \u03c0r\u00b2 = 9\u03c0, and we have \u222cR (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dA = (81/2)\u03c0, so the average value is (81/2)\u03c0 / 9\u03c0 = 81/18 = 9/2 = 4.5\n\nBut I seem to recall that the average distance squared from the center in a disk is (2r\u00b2)/3.\n\nWait, for a uniform disk, the average value of r\u00b2 is (2r\u00b2)/3.\n\nWait, let's check.\n\nIf r ranges from 0 to 3, and the area element is r dr d\u03b8, then the average value of r\u00b2 is (1 / area) \u222b\u222b r\u00b2 * r dr d\u03b8 = (1 / area) \u222b\u222b r\u00b3 dr d\u03b8\n\nWhich is the same integral we evaluated earlier divided by the area.\n\nSo, average r\u00b2 = (81/2)\u03c0 / (9\u03c0) = 9/2\n\nBut I thought it was (2r\u00b2)/3 = (2*9)/3 = 6, which is different from 9/2 = 4.5\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering the formula for the average value of r\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute it directly.\n\nThe average value of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 over the disk is:\n\n(1 / area) \u222cR (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dA = (1 / 9\u03c0) * (81/2)\u03c0 = 81/18 = 9/2 = 4.5\n\nBut if I use the formula (2r\u00b2)/3, that gives (2*9)/3 = 6, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula I recalled is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with the moment of inertia formula.\n\nWait, in physics, the moment of inertia of a disk about its central axis is (1/2)mr\u00b2, which is what I used earlier.\n\nGiven that, and with m = \u03c0r\u00b2 for unit density, the moment of inertia I = (1/2)(\u03c0r\u00b2)r\u00b2 = (1/2)\u03c0r\u2074\n\nFor r=3, I = (1/2)\u03c0(81) = (81/2)\u03c0, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the double integral \u222cR (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) dA is indeed (81/2)\u03c0.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is (81/2)\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, to express it in decimal form, that would be approximately (81/2)*3.1416 = 40.5 * 3.1416 \u2248 127.17, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll leave it in terms of \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the value of the double integral is (81/2)\u03c0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{81}{2} \\pi} \\]"
