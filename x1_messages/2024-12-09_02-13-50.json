        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a cyclist who travels at two different speeds for different durations. First, they go at 15 miles per hour for 4 hours, and then they speed up to 20 miles per hour for another 3 hours. We need to find out what their average speed was for the entire trip.\n\nAlright, so average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? That's the basic formula. So, I need to find the total distance they traveled and the total time they spent cycling.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip.\n\nFor the first part:\n\nSpeed = 15 mph\n\nTime = 4 hours\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 15 mph \u00d7 4 h = 60 miles\n\nOkay, so the first part is 60 miles.\n\nNow, for the second part:\n\nSpeed = 20 mph\n\nTime = 3 hours\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 20 mph \u00d7 3 h = 60 miles\n\nSo, the second part is also 60 miles.\n\nNow, the total distance is the sum of both parts:\n\nTotal distance = 60 miles + 60 miles = 120 miles\n\nNext, the total time is the sum of the times for both parts:\n\nTotal time = 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours\n\nNow, average speed = total distance / total time = 120 miles / 7 hours\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n120 divided by 7 is approximately 17.142857... miles per hour.\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire trip is approximately 17.14 miles per hour.\n\nBut, you know, I'm a bit unsure. Let me double-check if I did this correctly. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that when speeds are different for different durations, the average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean of the speeds. It's the total distance divided by the total time, which is what I did. But maybe there's a formula for average speed when you have two different speeds and times.\n\nLet me think about it. Alternatively, I could think of it in terms of weighted averages, where the weights are the times spent at each speed.\n\nSo, average speed = (speed1 \u00d7 time1 + speed2 \u00d7 time2) / (time1 + time2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAverage speed = (15 mph \u00d7 4 h + 20 mph \u00d7 3 h) / (4 h + 3 h) = (60 + 60) / 7 = 120 / 7 \u2248 17.14 mph\n\nOkay, that's the same result I got earlier. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach it another way to confirm. Let's see.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the average speed using the harmonic mean, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. I think the harmonic mean is used when the distances are equal, but in this case, the times are equal for each speed segment.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of weighted averages, where the weights are the fractions of the total time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, the fraction of time at 15 mph is 4 hours out of 7 hours, which is 4/7.\n\nThe fraction of time at 20 mph is 3 hours out of 7 hours, which is 3/7.\n\nTherefore, average speed = (15 mph \u00d7 4/7) + (20 mph \u00d7 3/7)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(15 \u00d7 4/7) + (20 \u00d7 3/7) = (60/7) + (60/7) = 120/7 \u2248 17.14 mph\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me more confidence that I'm on the right track.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other method to verify this.\n\nSuppose I plot the speed-time graph. The first 4 hours, the speed is 15 mph, and the next 3 hours, it's 20 mph. The total distance would be the area under the speed-time graph.\n\nSo, the area would be a rectangle of 4 hours by 15 mph, which is 60 miles, plus a rectangle of 3 hours by 20 mph, which is 60 miles, totaling 120 miles, over 7 hours, giving an average speed of 120/7 \u2248 17.14 mph.\n\nOkay, that's consistent again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of the total displacement, but since the cyclist is moving in a straight line at these speeds, and no directions are given, I'll assume it's all in the same direction, so total distance is the same as displacement.\n\nWait, but average speed is total distance over total time, while average velocity is displacement over time. But since no directions are given, I'll stick with average speed.\n\nAnother thought: if the cyclist had traveled equal distances at each speed, then the average speed would be the harmonic mean of the speeds. But in this case, the times are equal for the segments, not the distances, so that doesn't apply here.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the cyclist's average speed for the entire trip is approximately 17.14 miles per hour.\n\nBut, to be precise, it's 120 divided by 7, which is exactly 17.142857... mph. Maybe I should present it as a fraction or with more decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in miles per hour with two decimal places.\n\nSo, I'll say the average speed is approximately 17.14 mph.\n\nWait, but maybe I can check if there's a more exact way to express it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can leave it as a fraction: 120/7 mph.\n\nThat is approximately 17.142857... mph, which rounds to 17.14 mph.\n\nBut, to be precise, it's 120/7 mph.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in miles per hour with a fraction.\n\nWait, 120 divided by 7 is 17 and 1/7 mph.\n\nBecause 7 \u00d7 17 = 119, and there's a remainder of 1, so it's 17 1/7 mph.\n\nSo, 17 1/7 mph is exactly equal to 120/7 mph.\n\nThat's another way to express it.\n\nSo, I can present the answer as approximately 17.14 mph or exactly 17 1/7 mph.\n\nI think both are acceptable, depending on the context.\n\nBut since the problem gives speeds and times in whole numbers, perhaps expressing the answer as a fraction is more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a decimal, then 17.14 mph is fine.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see if there's any other factor I'm missing.\n\nIs there any reason why the average speed wouldn't be total distance over total time in this case?\n\nI don't think so. This seems like a straightforward application of the average speed formula.\n\nNo need to consider acceleration or anything like that, as the speeds are given as averages for their respective time periods.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the average speed for the entire trip is 120 miles divided by 7 hours, which is approximately 17.14 miles per hour or exactly 17 1/7 miles per hour.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 17.14 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17.14 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
