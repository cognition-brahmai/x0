        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a basketball player has a free throw shooting percentage of 75%, and I need to find the probability that they'll make exactly 3 out of their next 5 free throws. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that probability deals with chances of events happening, and in this case, it's about making or missing free throws. The player's free throw shooting percentage is 75%, which means they make 75% of their free throws. So, the probability of making a single free throw is 0.75, and consequently, the probability of missing a single free throw is 1 - 0.75 = 0.25.\n\nNow, the question is about making exactly 3 out of 5 free throws. This sounds like a binomial probability problem because each free throw is an independent event with two possible outcomes: make or miss. The binomial probability formula is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = C(n,k) \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (in this case, 5 free throws),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful trials (making 3 free throws),\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on an individual trial (0.75),\n\n- \\( C(n,k) \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(3) = C(5,3) \\times 0.75^3 \\times 0.25^{2} \\]\n\nI need to calculate \\( C(5,3) \\) first. I recall that \\( C(n,k) \\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[ C(n,k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ C(5,3) = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10 \\]\n\nNow, calculating \\( 0.75^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.75^3 = 0.75 \\times 0.75 \\times 0.75 = 0.421875 \\]\n\nAnd \\( 0.25^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.25^2 = 0.25 \\times 0.25 = 0.0625 \\]\n\nNow, multiplying these together:\n\n\\[ P(3) = 10 \\times 0.421875 \\times 0.0625 \\]\n\nFirst, multiply 0.421875 by 0.0625:\n\n\\[ 0.421875 \\times 0.0625 = 0.0263671875 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 10:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.0263671875 = 0.263671875 \\]\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2637, or 26.37%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- \\( C(5,3) = 10 \\) seems correct.\n\n- \\( 0.75^3 = 0.421875 \\) is correct.\n\n- \\( 0.25^2 = 0.0625 \\) is correct.\n\n- Multiplying them: \\( 10 \\times 0.421875 \\times 0.0625 \\)\n\nLet me calculate \\( 0.421875 \\times 0.0625 \\) again:\n\n\\[ 0.421875 \\times 0.0625 = 0.0263671875 \\]\n\nThen, \\( 10 \\times 0.0263671875 = 0.263671875 \\), which is approximately 26.37%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach to verify this result. Let's consider the possible sequences where the player makes exactly 3 out of 5 free throws.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 makes out of 5 throws is \\( C(5,3) = 10 \\), as I calculated before. Each specific sequence of 3 makes and 2 misses has the same probability:\n\n\\[ p^3 \\times (1-p)^2 = 0.75^3 \\times 0.25^2 = 0.421875 \\times 0.0625 = 0.0263671875 \\]\n\nThen, since there are 10 such sequences, the total probability is:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.0263671875 = 0.263671875 \\]\n\nWhich again is approximately 26.37%.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the binomial probability formula directly in a calculator or software, but since I'm doing it manually, this should suffice.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using combinations or permutations.\n\nWait, combinations are already used in the binomial formula to account for the different sequences.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible sequences of makes and misses, but that would be time-consuming for 5 free throws, as there are \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) possible sequences, and identifying the ones with exactly 3 makes.\n\nGiven that, relying on the binomial formula seems more efficient.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The probability is approximately 26.37%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider. Is the assumption of independence valid here? That is, does making or missing one free throw affect the probability of making the next one? In general, for free throws, it's reasonable to assume independence unless there's information suggesting otherwise, like the player getting into a rhythm or losing confidence.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, there's no indication of dependency, so the binomial model is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 26.37%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2637} \\]\n"
