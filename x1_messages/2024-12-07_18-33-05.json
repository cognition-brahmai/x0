        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company charges $50 per day and an additional $0.25 per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost if I rent the car for 5 days and drive 300 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for renting the car for 5 days. That should be straightforward: $50 per day times 5 days.\n\n$50 * 5 = $250\n\nOkay, so the base rental cost is $250.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 300 miles. The rate is $0.25 per mile.\n\n$0.25 * 300 = $75\n\nSo, the mileage cost is $75.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I'll add the base rental cost and the mileage cost together.\n\n$250 + $75 = $325\n\nTherefore, the total rental cost will be $325.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Are there any additional fees or taxes that might apply? The problem doesn't mention anything else, so I think $325 is the final amount.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nBase rental: $50 per day for 5 days is indeed $250.\n\nMileage: $0.25 per mile for 300 miles is $75.\n\nAdding them up gives $325.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{325} \\]"
