        "content": "So there are 20 students in the class, and 12 of them have brown eyes. That means the rest have blue eyes, right? So, first, I need to find out how many students have blue eyes. Since there are 20 students in total and 12 have brown eyes, I can subtract 12 from 20 to get the number of students with blue eyes. Let's see: 20 minus 12 is 8. So, 8 students have blue eyes.\n\nNow, to find out what percentage of the class has blue eyes, I need to find out what part of the total number of students, which is 20, is made up by the 8 students with blue eyes. Percentage means per hundred, so I need to express this relationship as a part of 100.\n\nThe formula to calculate the percentage is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of students with blue eyes, which is 8, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students, which is 20. Plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{8}{20} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFirst, I'll divide 8 by 20. 8 divided by 20 is 0.4. Then, multiplying 0.4 by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.4 \\times 100 = 40\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, 40% of the class has blue eyes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If there are 20 students in total and 8 have blue eyes, then the ratio of blue-eyed students to the total number of students is 8:20. Simplifying that ratio by dividing both numbers by 4, I get 2:5. To convert this ratio to a percentage, I can write it as a fraction and multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\\%\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the percentage of students with brown eyes first. Since 12 out of 20 students have brown eyes, the percentage would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 60\\%\n\\]\n\nAnd since the total percentage must add up to 100%, the percentage of students with blue eyes would be:\n\n\\[\n100\\% - 60\\% = 40\\%\n\\]\n\nAgain, that confirms that 40% of the class has blue eyes.\n\nI think that's correct. But let me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using proportions or something like that.\n\nSuppose I set up a proportion where the number of blue-eyed students over the total number of students is equal to the percentage of blue-eyed students over 100%. So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{x}{100}\n\\]\n\nThen, solving for x, which represents the percentage of blue-eyed students:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{8}{20} \\times 100 = 40\\%\n\\]\n\nOnce again, I get 40%. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if the numbers make sense. 20 students, 12 with brown eyes and 8 with blue eyes. 8 out of 20 is indeed 40%. Another way to think about it is that half of 20 is 10, which would be 50%, so 8 is a bit less, which corresponds to 40%.\n\nI can also verify this by considering decimals. 8 divided by 20 is 0.4, and 0.4 is equivalent to 40%. So, all these different approaches lead me to the same conclusion.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The percentage of the class that has blue eyes is 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
