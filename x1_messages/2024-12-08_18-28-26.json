        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: there's a square garden with sides that are 10 meters long. The gardener wants to build a circular fountain right in the center of the garden, and this fountain should touch all four sides of the square. I need to figure out what the diameter of this fountain is.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this scenario. I have a square, and inside it, there's a circle that touches all four sides of the square. So, the circle is inscribed within the square.\n\nIn geometry, when a circle is inscribed in a square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the side of the square. That seems straightforward.\n\nSo, since the side of the square is 10 meters, the diameter of the fountain should also be 10 meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the circle touches all four sides of the square, then from the center of the circle to any side is equal to half the diameter, which is the radius.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the square as S, which is 10 meters, and the diameter of the circle as D.\n\nIn an inscribed circle, the diameter D is equal to the side length S of the square. So, D = S = 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, the radius R would be D/2 = S/2 = 5 meters.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about the coordinates. If we place the square on a coordinate plane with its center at (0,0), then the vertices of the square would be at (5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), and (-5,-5), since the side length is 10 meters.\n\nThe circle centered at (0,0) that touches all four sides would have a radius equal to the distance from the center to any side, which is 5 meters. Therefore, the diameter is 10 meters.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the diagonal of the square. The diagonal of the square would be S\u221a2 = 10\u221a2 meters. But in this case, the circle is not circumscribed around the square; it's inscribed within it. So, the diagonal isn't directly relevant here.\n\nUnless, perhaps, I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe \"touching all four sides\" doesn't mean that the circle is inscribed in the square in the usual geometric sense. Maybe it means that the circle is tangent to all four sides.\n\nWait, in geometry, \"touching\" usually means \"tangent to.\" So, if the circle is tangent to all four sides of the square, that indeed means it's inscribed within the square, and its diameter should equal the side length of the square.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other interpretation. Perhaps the circle is not necessarily centered in the square but still touches all four sides. However, for a circle to touch all four sides of a square, it must be centered in the square.\n\nTo see why, suppose the circle is not centered. Then, the distances from the center of the circle to the four sides would not be equal, meaning the circle would touch some sides but not others, or touch some sides at multiple points, which wouldn't make sense for a circle.\n\nTherefore, the circle must be centered in the square, and its radius must be equal to half the side length of the square.\n\nSo, radius R = S/2 = 10/2 = 5 meters, and diameter D = 2R = 10 meters.\n\nAlternatively, using the Pythagorean theorem, if I consider the distance from the center of the circle to a corner of the square, that distance would be R\u221a2, which for R=5 meters, is 5\u221a2 meters. But again, this isn't directly relevant to finding the diameter in this scenario.\n\nI think I've confirmed enough that the diameter of the fountain is indeed 10 meters.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's consider the area. The area of the square is S\u00b2 = 100 square meters. The area of the circle is \u03c0R\u00b2 = \u03c0(25) \u2248 78.54 square meters. But again, the area isn't directly relevant to finding the diameter, so this is just an additional point.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem meant that the circle touches all four sides but is not necessarily inscribed, perhaps it's possible to have a smaller circle that still touches all four sides in some way, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"touches all four sides\" means that the circle intersects each side at least once, but not necessarily being tangent to them.\n\nHowever, in standard geometric terminology, \"touches\" generally implies tangency.\n\nSuppose the circle intersects each side but isn't tangent to them. In that case, it would cross into the square and not just touch the sides, which wouldn't make sense for the description provided.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the circle is inscribed within the square, meaning it's tangent to all four sides, and thus its diameter equals the side length of the square.\n\nHence, the diameter of the fountain is 10 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
