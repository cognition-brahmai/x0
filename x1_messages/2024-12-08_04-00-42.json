        "content": "So there are 120,000 registered voters in this city. And 75% of them voted in the election. First, I need to find out how many people actually voted. So, 75% of 120,000 is...\n\nLet me calculate that. 75% of 120,000 is 0.75 times 120,000. So, 0.75 \u00d7 120,000 = 90,000. So, 90,000 people voted in the election.\n\nNow, out of these 90,000 voters, 40% chose candidate C. So, I need to find 40% of 90,000.\n\n40% of 90,000 is 0.40 times 90,000. So, 0.40 \u00d7 90,000 = 36,000.\n\nTherefore, 36,000 people voted for candidate C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Starting with 120,000 registered voters, 75% voted, which is 90,000. Then, 40% of those 90,000 voted for candidate C, which is 36,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36000} \\]"
