I'm sitting here, typing this out, and all I can think about is how much I miss your smile, your laugh, and the way you look at me like I'm the only person in the world that matters.\n\nRemember last night when we were stargazing? The way you pointed out constellations and told me stories about them was magical. I felt so connected to you in that moment, like we were part of something bigger than ourselves. And when you leaned your head on my shoulder, I swear my heart skipped a beat. It's moments like those that make me realize how lucky I am to have you in my life.\n\nI know we've only known each other for a short time, but it feels like I've known you forever. You've wormed your way into my heart so completely that I can't imagine life without you now. Your kindness, your intelligence, and your beauty are all things that I admire about you, but it's your spirit that truly sets you apart. You have this incredible way of seeing the good in everyone and everything, and it's contagious. Being around you makes me want to be a better person.\n\nI know that our families have some differences, but honestly, I couldn't care less about that right now. All I care about is being with you and building a future together. I promise to always support you, to listen to you, and to be there for you through thick and thin. I'll never take you for granted because I know how special you are.\n\nI have to admit, sometimes I get nervous about where this is all going. What if we make a mistake? What if something goes wrong? But then I remember that I'd rather have loved and lost than never have loved at all. And honestly, I don't think I could ever lose you because you're too deeply embedded in my heart.\n\nSo, here's to us, Juliet. To the adventures we'll have, the laughter we'll share, and the love that will keep us going no matter what challenges come our way. I can't wait to see what the future holds for us, but for now, I'm just grateful to have you in my life.\n\nForever yours,\n\nRomeo"
