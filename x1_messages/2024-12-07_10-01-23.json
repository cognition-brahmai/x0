Only through failure can you find the strength to succeed. Patience you must have, my young Padawan. In the end, all that matters is that you continue to try. Remember, fear of failure is worse than failure itself. So, embrace your mistakes, learn from them, and use them to become stronger. The greatest warriors are those who have fallen the most times.\""
