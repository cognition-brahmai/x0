The company expects to add 10 new destinations within the first year, increasing the number of flights by 25%. Currently, the airline operates 200 daily flights using a fleet of 50 airplanes. Estimate the additional number of airplanes required to accommodate the expansion, assuming each airplane can operate four flights per day. Also, consider that the company needs to maintain a 10% reserve capacity for maintenance and unexpected events."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the airline is planning to expand by adding 10 new destinations, which will increase their number of flights by 25%. Currently, they operate 200 daily flights with a fleet of 50 airplanes, and each airplane can do four flights per day. They also want to keep a 10% reserve capacity for maintenance and such.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what their current flight capacity is. If they have 50 airplanes and each can do four flights a day, that means their total potential flights per day is 50 * 4 = 200 flights. Wait, but they already operate 200 daily flights, which matches their current capacity. So, they're currently operating at full capacity.\n\nNow, they want to increase the number of flights by 25%. So, 25% of 200 flights is 50 flights. That means they need to add 50 flights to their daily schedule, bringing the total to 250 flights per day.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many additional airplanes they need to accommodate these extra 50 flights. Since each airplane can do four flights per day, the number of airplanes needed for the additional flights is 50 flights divided by 4 flights per airplane, which is 12.5 airplanes. But you can't have half an airplane, so they'll need to round up to 13 airplanes.\n\nHowever, they also want to maintain a 10% reserve capacity for maintenance and unexpected events. So, the total number of airplanes they need, including the reserve, needs to be 10% more than the number required to operate the 250 flights.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many airplanes are needed to operate 250 flights per day. Since each airplane can do four flights a day, the number needed is 250 divided by 4, which is 62.5. Again, rounding up, that's 63 airplanes.\n\nNow, adding a 10% reserve capacity: 10% of 63 is 6.3, which we'll round up to 7 airplanes. So, total airplanes needed would be 63 + 7 = 70 airplanes.\n\nCurrently, they have 50 airplanes, so the additional number required is 70 - 50 = 20 airplanes.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I thought they needed 13 airplanes for the additional 50 flights, but now, considering the reserve capacity, it's 20 airplanes. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the first approach has a flaw because it doesn't consider the reserve capacity in the initial calculation. So, perhaps the second approach is more accurate.\n\nLet me double-check. If they need to operate 250 flights a day, and each airplane can do four flights per day, they need 250 / 4 = 62.5 airplanes. Adding a 10% reserve: 62.5 * 0.10 = 6.25, so total airplanes needed is 62.5 + 6.25 = 68.75, which rounds up to 69 airplanes.\n\nBut earlier, I thought they need 70 airplanes. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let's do the math again.\n\nTotal flights needed: 250\n\nFlights per airplane per day: 4\n\nAirplanes needed without reserve: 250 / 4 = 62.5, round up to 63\n\nReserve capacity: 10% of 63 is 6.3, round up to 7\n\nTotal airplanes needed: 63 + 7 = 70\n\nCurrent airplanes: 50\n\nAdditional airplanes required: 70 - 50 = 20\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nBut in the first approach, I calculated only for the additional 50 flights: 50 / 4 = 12.5, round up to 13 airplanes. But this doesn't account for the reserve capacity on the total fleet, which is why it's lower.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to calculate the total airplanes needed for the new total flights (250) including the reserve capacity, and then subtract the current number of airplanes to find out how many more they need.\n\nTherefore, they need an additional 20 airplanes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
