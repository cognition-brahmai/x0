        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has a total of 200 cars in their fleet. According to the information, 60% of these are sedans, 30% are SUVs, and the remaining 10% are luxury vehicles. I need to find out how many more sedans there are compared to luxury vehicles.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate how many sedans there are. Since 60% of the fleet are sedans, I can find that by taking 60% of 200. Let me do that:\n\nNumber of sedans = 60% of 200 = (60/100) * 200 = 0.6 * 200 = 120 sedans.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many luxury vehicles there are. They make up 10% of the fleet, so:\n\nNumber of luxury vehicles = 10% of 200 = (10/100) * 200 = 0.1 * 200 = 20 luxury vehicles.\n\nNow, to find out how many more sedans there are than luxury vehicles, I just need to subtract the number of luxury vehicles from the number of sedans:\n\nMore sedans = Number of sedans - Number of luxury vehicles = 120 - 20 = 100.\n\nSo, there are 100 more sedans than luxury vehicles in the fleet.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider here? The question seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nLet me verify the percentages first. 60% sedans, 30% SUVs, and 10% luxury vehicles. If I add those up, 60% + 30% + 10% = 100%, which covers the entire fleet, so that checks out.\n\nNow, confirming the number of sedans: 60% of 200 is indeed 120. Similarly, 10% of 200 is 20 for luxury vehicles. Subtracting those gives me 100, which seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer: there are 100 more sedans than luxury vehicles in the fleet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
