        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle with an area of 48 square inches, and its length is twice its width. We need to find the dimensions of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, I recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, if we let the width be \\( w \\) inches, then the length must be \\( 2w \\) inches because it's twice the width. Therefore, the area can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 2w \\times w = 2w^2\n\\]\n\nWe know the area is 48 square inches, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n2w^2 = 48\n\\]\n\nNow, to find \\( w \\), I'll solve for \\( w \\) in this equation. First, divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nw^2 = 24\n\\]\n\nThen, take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nw = \\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6} = 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the width is \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches. Since the length is twice the width, the length is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{6} = 4\\sqrt{6} \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let me check if these dimensions indeed give an area of 48 square inches.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 4\\sqrt{6} \\times 2\\sqrt{6} = 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nYes, that checks out. But, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using different variables or considering different properties of rectangles.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose I let the width be \\( x \\) inches and the length be \\( y \\) inches. I know that:\n\n\\[\ny = 2x\n\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[\nx \\times y = 48\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( y \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[\nx \\times 2x = 2x^2 = 48\n\\]\n\nThis brings me back to the same equation as before:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 = 48\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 24 \\implies x = \\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6} \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nAnd then \\( y = 2x = 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches. So, I end up with the same dimensions again.\n\nIs there a way to express these dimensions without using radicals? Maybe by rationalizing the expression or finding decimal approximations.\n\nLet me calculate the numerical value of \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\). First, \\( \\sqrt{6} \\) is approximately 2.449, so:\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{6} \\approx 2 \\times 2.449 = 4.898 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[\n4\\sqrt{6} \\approx 4 \\times 2.449 = 9.796 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately, the width is about 4.9 inches and the length is about 9.8 inches.\n\nBut, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem. Maybe the length isn't exactly twice the width, but somehow related differently. Wait, no, the problem clearly states that the length is twice the width.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple sets of dimensions that satisfy the area being 48 square inches, but with the condition that length is twice the width, there should be only one solution.\n\nLet me consider if there's a possibility of negative dimensions. Well, dimensions can't be negative in reality, so we can disregard any negative solutions from the equation.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rectangle could be oriented differently, with width and length swapped. But according to the problem, the length is specifically twice the width, so swapping them wouldn't satisfy that condition.\n\nLet me consider if there's a way to express the dimensions using fractions or other forms. For example, \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) can be written as \\( \\sqrt{24} \\), but that doesn't seem simpler.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the dimensions in terms of the area. Since area is 48, and length is twice width, maybe there's a ratio involved.\n\nThe ratio of length to width is 2:1, so the dimensions are in the ratio 2:1, and the area is 48.\n\nUsing the ratio, let\u2019s denote the width as \\( k \\) and the length as \\( 2k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive real number.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n2k \\times k = 48 \\implies 2k^2 = 48 \\implies k^2 = 24 \\implies k = \\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nSo, width \\( w = k = 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches, and length \\( l = 2k = 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nThis confirms my earlier result.\n\nLet me think if there's another mathematical approach, perhaps using perimeter or other properties, but the problem only provides information about the area and the relationship between length and width, so it's sufficient to solve with just these two equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using quadratic equations or factoring, but since we already have a straightforward equation \\( 2w^2 = 48 \\), solving for \\( w \\) is straightforward.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps considering that the area is 48, which can be factored in different ways, but given the specific relationship between length and width, only one pair of factors will satisfy that condition.\n\nLet me list the factor pairs of 48:\n\n1. 1 and 48\n\n2. 2 and 24\n\n3. 3 and 16\n\n4. 4 and 12\n\n5. 6 and 8\n\nNow, which of these pairs has one dimension being twice the other?\n\nLooking at the pairs:\n\n1. 1 and 48: 48 is not twice 1.\n\n2. 2 and 24: 24 is twelve times 2, not twice.\n\n3. 3 and 16: 16 is not twice 3.\n\n4. 4 and 12: 12 is three times 4, not twice.\n\n5. 6 and 8: 8 is roughly 1.33 times 6, not twice.\n\nWait, none of these integer pairs satisfy the condition that length is twice the width. That suggests that the dimensions are not integers, which aligns with my earlier finding that width is \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches, which is approximately 4.9 inches, and length is \\( 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches, approximately 9.8 inches.\n\nPerhaps I can verify this by multiplying them:\n\n\\[\n4.898 \\times 9.796 \\approx 48 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's close enough, considering rounding errors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( w \\). Starting from the equation:\n\n\\[\n2w^2 = 48\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 48 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2w^2 - 48 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 2:\n\n\\[\nw^2 - 24 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a simple quadratic equation, and solving for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[\nw^2 = 24 \\implies w = \\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6} \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nLet me consider if there's a geometric interpretation. If I draw a rectangle and label the width as \\( w \\) and the length as \\( 2w \\), then the area is \\( 2w^2 = 48 \\), which again leads to \\( w = 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of similar rectangles or scale factors, but that seems unnecessarily complicated for this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to use substitution or elimination methods, but since there are only two variables and one relationship, substitution is the most straightforward method.\n\nLet me try to set up the problem using variables for both length and width without assuming any relationship initially.\n\nLet \\( l \\) be the length and \\( w \\) be the width.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. \\( l = 2w \\)\n\n2. \\( l \\times w = 48 \\)\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n\n\\[\n(2w) \\times w = 48 \\implies 2w^2 = 48\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nSolving for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[\nw^2 = 24 \\implies w = \\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6} \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( l = 2w = 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same dimensions.\n\nPerhaps I can consider dimensional analysis or unit analysis to ensure that my units are consistent.\n\nGiven that area is in square inches, and dimensions are in inches, my calculations appear consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the perimeter and see if there's any relationship, but the problem doesn't provide information about the perimeter, so that won't help.\n\nAnother thought: maybe there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check the square root of 24.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{6} = 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rationalize the denominator or manipulate the expression further, but it's already in a simplified form.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem. For example, maybe the \"length\" isn't necessarily the longer side, but in common usage, length is considered longer than width, and the problem specifies that length is twice the width, so it's clear that length is the longer side.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps there are multiple rectangles with different orientations that satisfy the area and the length-width relationship, but given the specific condition, there should be only one unique rectangle up to rotation.\n\nWait, but rectangles are considered differently oriented if rotated by 90 degrees, but in terms of dimensions, swapping length and width wouldn't satisfy the length being twice the width, unless the rectangle is square, which in this case it's not, since length is twice width.\n\nTherefore, only one set of dimensions satisfies the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are rectangles with irrational dimensions that satisfy the condition, but in this case, \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) and \\( 4\\sqrt{6} \\) are indeed irrational, but they are specific values.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to express these dimensions in terms of fractions or other radicals, but \\( \\sqrt{6} \\) is already in its simplest form.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the properties of proportions. Since length is twice width, the ratio of length to width is 2:1.\n\nGiven that, and the area is 48, I can set up a proportion.\n\nLet me denote the width as \\( w \\), then length is \\( 2w \\), and area is \\( 2w^2 = 48 \\), which again leads to the same equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of geometric mean or other mean proportions, but that seems overcomplicated for this problem.\n\nLet me consider if there's a mistake in the problem statement. The area is given as 48 square inches, and length is twice the width. Is there any other information that I'm missing?\n\nAssuming the problem is correctly stated, and there are no typos, then the solution I've arrived at should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for different units, but it specifies square inches, so the dimensions should be in inches.\n\nAnother thought: maybe there are multiple possible solutions if we consider negative dimensions, but as mentioned earlier, dimensions can't be negative, so we disregard those solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are complex number solutions, but that's not relevant for this real-world problem.\n\nLet me consider if there's a way to verify this solution without solving the equation again.\n\nGiven that area is 48, and length is twice width, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{width} = 2\\sqrt{6} \\approx 4.898 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = 4\\sqrt{6} \\approx 9.796 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} \\approx 4.898 \\times 9.796 \\approx 48 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the solution is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the perimeter to see if it matches any expected value, but since the problem doesn't provide the perimeter, that's not necessary.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of square roots, or perhaps simplified in a different way.\n\nGiven that \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) is the exact value, and approximately 4.898 inches, either form is acceptable depending on the context.\n\nPerhaps in some applications, leaving it in terms of square roots is more precise, while in others, the decimal approximation is more useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in fractional form, but since \\( \\sqrt{6} \\) is irrational, it can't be expressed exactly as a fraction.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps there's a mistake in the reference solution or answer key, and I should consider other possibilities.\n\nHowever, given the logical steps I've followed and the consistency of the solution, I'm confident that the dimensions are indeed width \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches and length \\( 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem graphically, by plotting the equations and finding the intersection point.\n\nLet me set up the equations:\n\n1. \\( l = 2w \\)\n\n2. \\( l \\times w = 48 \\)\n\nPlotting these on a graph with \\( w \\) on the x-axis and \\( l \\) on the y-axis, the first equation is a straight line passing through the origin with slope 2.\n\nThe second equation is a hyperbola, \\( l = \\frac{48}{w} \\).\n\nTo find the intersection points, set \\( 2w = \\frac{48}{w} \\), which gives \\( 2w^2 = 48 \\), leading to the same equation as before.\n\nSolving this, \\( w^2 = 24 \\), so \\( w = \\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches, and \\( l = 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nGraphically, there would be two intersection points, one in the positive quadrant and one in the negative quadrant, but since dimensions can't be negative, we only consider the positive solution.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is width \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches and length \\( 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use calculus to minimize or maximize some function related to the rectangle, but that seems unnecessary for this problem, as we have enough information to solve it directly.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the method of completing the square for the quadratic equation, although it's not needed here since the equation is simple.\n\nStarting from \\( 2w^2 = 48 \\), dividing both sides by 2 gives \\( w^2 = 24 \\), and taking square roots gives \\( w = \\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nThis is straightforward and doesn't require completing the square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the aspect ratio of the rectangle. The aspect ratio is length divided by width, which is 2:1 in this case.\n\nGiven that, and the area, I can set up the equations accordingly, which again leads to the same solution.\n\nAnother angle: maybe I can use logarithms or other advanced functions, but that would be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a geometric series or sequence that can model this situation, but I don't see a direct connection.\n\nLet me consider if there are any similar triangles or other geometric properties that could be applied here, but since it's a simple rectangle, there aren't any additional properties to consider.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can express the dimensions in terms of trigonometric functions, but that seems highly unlikely and irrelevant for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the rectangle inscribed in a circle or some other shape, but again, that's not relevant here.\n\nGiven all this, I conclude that the dimensions of the rectangle are width \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches and length \\( 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows for an approximate numerical answer, I can provide the decimal approximations: width approximately 4.9 inches and length approximately 9.8 inches.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll keep the answer in terms of square roots for exactness.\n\nAnother consideration: perhaps the problem is testing the understanding of the relationship between area, length, and width, and the ability to set up and solve equations based on given conditions.\n\nIn that case, demonstrating the step-by-step process, as I have done, is important for illustrating the understanding of the concept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is part of a larger set, and there are multiple rectangles to consider, but based on the information provided, it seems to be a standalone problem.\n\nGiven that, and the consistency of the solution across different approaches, I'm confident that the dimensions are width \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches and length \\( 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation, and I need to double-check the arithmetic.\n\nStarting from \\( 2w^2 = 48 \\), dividing both sides by 2 gives \\( w^2 = 24 \\). Taking the square root of both sides gives \\( w = \\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nThen, length \\( l = 2w = 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nMultiplying to check the area: \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\times 4\\sqrt{6} = 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\) square inches, which confirms the solution.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions are indeed width \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches and length \\( 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows for different units, perhaps converting inches to centimeters or other units, but since the problem specifies inches, there's no need for conversion.\n\nAnother thought: maybe there's a way to express the dimensions using different radical forms, but \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) is already simplified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps writing it as \\( \\sqrt{24} \\), but that's equivalent and doesn't provide additional insight.\n\nGiven all this, I conclude that the dimensions of the rectangle are width \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches and length \\( 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe width of the rectangle is \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\) inches, and the length is \\( 4\\sqrt{6} \\) inches."
