Martin Luther King Jr. was not involved in the fight for women's suffrage; he was a prominent leader in the African American civil rights movement. Additionally, his assassination occurred on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, not July 4, 1968, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was assassinated by James Earl Ray, not John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Abraham Lincoln in 1865. The assassination indeed triggered nationwide protests and intensified the struggle for civil rights.\n\nTo answer your question accurately: Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nCitation: https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr-assassination"
