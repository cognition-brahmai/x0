        "content": "So I have this power series: the sum from n equals 0 to infinity of (n times x to the n) divided by (n plus 1). I need to find the radius of convergence for this series. I remember that the radius of convergence is about figuring out for which values of x this infinite sum actually makes sense, meaning it converges to a finite value.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula or the test that helps me find the radius of convergence for a power series. I think the ratio test is commonly used for this purpose. The ratio test involves looking at the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the (n+1)th term divided by the nth term of the series.\n\nSo, let's denote the general term of the series as a_n = (n * x^n) / (n + 1). Then, the (n+1)th term would be a_{n+1} = ((n + 1) * x^{n+1}) / (n + 2).\n\nApplying the ratio test, I need to compute:\n\nlim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_{n+1} / a_n| = lim (n\u2192\u221e) | [((n + 1) * x^{n+1}) / (n + 2)] / [(n * x^n) / (n + 1)] |\n\nSimplifying the fraction inside the limit:\n\n= lim (n\u2192\u221e) | [((n + 1) * x^{n+1}) / (n + 2)] * [(n + 1) / (n * x^n)] |\n\n= lim (n\u2192\u221e) | [ (n + 1)^2 * x ] / [ (n + 2) * n * x^n ] |\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the simplification.\n\nActually, when dividing fractions, it's the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So:\n\na_{n+1} / a_n = [((n + 1) * x^{n+1}) / (n + 2)] * [(n + 1) / (n * x^n)]\n\nBecause dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\nWait, no. Actually, a_n is (n * x^n) / (n + 1), so its reciprocal is (n + 1) / (n * x^n). Therefore:\n\na_{n+1} / a_n = [((n + 1) * x^{n+1}) / (n + 2)] * [(n + 1) / (n * x^n)]\n\n= [ (n + 1) * x^{n+1} * (n + 1) ] / [ (n + 2) * n * x^n ]\n\n= [ (n + 1)^2 * x^{n+1} ] / [ (n + 2) * n * x^n ]\n\nNow, x^{n+1} / x^n = x, so this simplifies to:\n\n= [ (n + 1)^2 * x ] / [ (n + 2) * n ]\n\nNow, I need to take the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of this expression:\n\nlim (n\u2192\u221e) | [ (n + 1)^2 * x ] / [ (n + 2) * n ] |\n\nSince x is a constant with respect to n, I can factor it out:\n\n= |x| * lim (n\u2192\u221e) [ (n + 1)^2 ] / [ (n + 2) * n ]\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression inside the limit. Let's expand (n + 1)^2:\n\n(n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1\n\nAnd the denominator is (n + 2) * n = n^2 + 2n\n\nSo, the limit becomes:\n\nlim (n\u2192\u221e) (n^2 + 2n + 1) / (n^2 + 2n)\n\nTo find this limit, I can divide the numerator and the denominator by n^2:\n\n= lim (n\u2192\u221e) (1 + 2/n + 1/n^2) / (1 + 2/n)\n\nAs n approaches infinity, 2/n and 1/n^2 approach 0, so this limit is:\n\n= (1 + 0 + 0) / (1 + 0) = 1/1 = 1\n\nTherefore, the limit is 1. So, the ratio test tells me that the series converges absolutely if this limit is less than 1, and diverges if it's greater than 1.\n\nBut in this case, the limit is 1, so the series converges absolutely when |x| * 1 < 1, which is |x| < 1.\n\nTherefore, the radius of convergence R is 1.\n\nWait, but I need to check the endpoints x = 1 and x = -1 to see if the series converges at those points.\n\nFirst, let's check x = 1:\n\nThe series becomes sum from n=0 to \u221e of (n * 1^n) / (n + 1) = sum of n / (n + 1).\n\nAs n approaches infinity, n / (n + 1) approaches 1, which means the terms don't approach zero. Therefore, by the divergence test, the series diverges at x = 1.\n\nNow, let's check x = -1:\n\nThe series becomes sum from n=0 to \u221e of (n * (-1)^n) / (n + 1).\n\nThis is an alternating series. To check for convergence, I can use the alternating series test. The test says that if the absolute value of the terms decreases to zero, the series converges.\n\nLet\u2019s look at |a_n| = n / (n + 1). As n approaches infinity, n / (n + 1) approaches 1, which doesn't approach zero. Therefore, the series diverges at x = -1 as well.\n\nTherefore, the interval of convergence is -1 < x < 1, and the radius of convergence is R = 1.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Applied the ratio test to find lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_{n+1}/a_n|.\n\n2. Simplified the expression and found the limit to be 1.\n\n3. Concluded that the series converges absolutely when |x| < 1.\n\n4. Checked the endpoints x = 1 and x = -1 and found that the series diverges at both points.\n\nTherefore, the radius of convergence is indeed 1.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider another method to confirm this result.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the root test. The root test involves computing lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^{1/n}.\n\nLet's try that.\n\na_n = (n * x^n) / (n + 1)\n\nSo, |a_n|^{1/n} = | (n * x^n) / (n + 1) |^{1/n} = |x| * (n / (n + 1))^{1/n}\n\nNow, as n approaches infinity, n / (n + 1) approaches 1, and 1^{1/n} is still 1.\n\nTherefore, lim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n|^{1/n} = |x| * 1 = |x|\n\nAccording to the root test, the series converges absolutely when this limit is less than 1, so when |x| < 1.\n\nThis matches the result I got from the ratio test.\n\nTherefore, the radius of convergence is R = 1.\n\nAnd since the series diverges at both endpoints x = 1 and x = -1, the interval of convergence is strictly -1 < x < 1.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
