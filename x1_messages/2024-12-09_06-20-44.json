        "content": "So, you want to save $1,200 in one year by putting some money aside each month. Let's figure out how much you need to deposit monthly to reach that goal.\n\nFirst, we need to know how many months there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.\n\nSo, if you want to save $1,200 over 12 months, you can divide the total amount by the number of months to find out how much to save each month.\n\nThat is:\n\nMonthly deposit = Total savings goal / Number of months\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nMonthly deposit = $1,200 / 12\n\nMonthly deposit = $100\n\nSo, you would need to deposit $100 each month to save $1,200 in one year.\n\nBut let's think about this a bit more. Maybe you'd like to consider some other factors.\n\nFor example, maybe you expect to receive some extra money during the year, like a birthday gift or a bonus at work. If you anticipate receiving, say, $200 during the year, you could adjust your monthly savings accordingly.\n\nIf you expect an additional $200, you could subtract that from your total savings goal.\n\nAdjusted savings goal = $1,200 - $200 = $1,000\n\nThen, your monthly deposit would be:\n\nMonthly deposit = $1,000 / 12 \u2248 $83.33\n\nSo, in that case, you'd need to save about $83.33 each month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you're considering earning interest on your savings. If your savings account earns interest, you might be able to save a little less each month because the interest will help your savings grow.\n\nLet's say your savings account offers an annual interest rate of 1%. To calculate the exact amount you need to save each month considering interest, we'd need to use the future value of an annuity formula.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nFV = P * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r\n\nWhere:\n\n- FV is the future value (your savings goal)\n\n- P is the monthly deposit\n\n- r is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)\n\n- n is the number of months\n\nIn this case:\n\nFV = $1,200\n\nr = 1% per year / 12 months = 0.01 / 12 \u2248 0.000833\n\nn = 12\n\nWe need to solve for P.\n\nRearranging the formula:\n\nP = FV * r / [(1 + r)^n - 1]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP = 1200 * 0.000833 / [(1 + 0.000833)^12 - 1]\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + r)^n:\n\n(1 + 0.000833)^12 \u2248 1.010038\n\nThen, the denominator:\n\n1.010038 - 1 = 0.010038\n\nNow, the monthly deposit:\n\nP \u2248 1200 * 0.000833 / 0.010038 \u2248 99.60\n\nSo, considering a 1% annual interest rate, you'd need to deposit about $99.60 each month.\n\nComparing this to the initial calculation without interest ($100), the difference is negligible for such a low interest rate and short time period.\n\nIf the interest rate were higher, say 5% per year, let's see how that affects the monthly deposit.\n\nr = 5% / 12 = 0.05 / 12 \u2248 0.004167\n\nP = 1200 * 0.004167 / [(1 + 0.004167)^12 - 1]\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + r)^n:\n\n(1 + 0.004167)^12 \u2248 1.05116\n\nThen, the denominator:\n\n1.05116 - 1 = 0.05116\n\nNow, the monthly deposit:\n\nP \u2248 1200 * 0.004167 / 0.05116 \u2248 98.25\n\nSo, with a 5% interest rate, you'd need to deposit about $98.25 each month to reach $1,200 in one year.\n\nAs you can see, even with a higher interest rate, the monthly deposit is only slightly less than the initial $100.\n\nGiven that the impact of interest is minimal over a one-year period, especially with modest interest rates, it's probably acceptable to use the simple division method for your monthly savings goal.\n\nTherefore, depositing $100 each month should get you very close to your goal of $1,200 in one year.\n\nHowever, to be safe, you might consider rounding up to the nearest dollar or even a bit more to account for any potential fees or to cover any minor miscalculations.\n\nFor example, depositing $100 each month will give you:\n\n$100 x 12 = $1,200\n\nIf you want to account for any possible deductions or to have a little buffer, you could deposit $101 or $102 per month.\n\n$101 x 12 = $1,212\n\n$102 x 12 = $1,224\n\nThis way, you ensure you meet or exceed your savings goal.\n\nAlternatively, if you find that $100 per month is stretching your budget, and you don't expect any additional income, you might need to adjust your savings goal accordingly.\n\nFor instance, if you can only manage $80 per month, your total savings after one year would be:\n\n$80 x 12 = $960\n\nWhich is $240 short of your $1,200 goal.\n\nIn that case, you might need to either increase your monthly deposits or extend the time frame to reach your goal.\n\nAlternatively, you could look for ways to increase your income or reduce expenses to free up more money for savings.\n\nAnother approach is to Prioritize your savings goal. Maybe $1,200 is not strictly necessary, and a lower amount would suffice. In that case, adjust your goal accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, if $1,200 is a must, you might need to find ways to increase your income, such as taking on a part-time job or selling some items you no longer need.\n\nIt's also important to consider your other financial obligations and ensure that your savings plan doesn't compromise your ability to meet necessary expenses.\n\nIn summary, to save $1,200 in one year, you should aim to deposit approximately $100 per month into your savings account.\n\nBut depending on various factors like additional income, interest earned, or budget constraints, you may need to adjust this amount accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your savings effectively!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
