        "content": "Let's see. There's a train going from station A to station B, and the total distance is 120 miles. It takes 2 hours to travel halfway and another 1 hour to complete the remaining half. I need to find the average speed of the train.\n\nFirst, I should understand what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if the train goes 120 miles in a certain amount of time, I just need to find that total time and then divide 120 by that time to get the average speed.\n\nOkay, the distance between A and B is 120 miles. Halfway would be 60 miles. The train takes 2 hours to cover the first 60 miles and 1 hour to cover the remaining 60 miles. So, the total time is 2 hours plus 1 hour, which is 3 hours.\n\nNow, average speed equals total distance divided by total time. So, that would be 120 miles divided by 3 hours, which is 40 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it. The train travels the first half at a certain speed and the second half at another speed. Maybe I should calculate the speeds for each half and then find the average.\n\nOkay, for the first half: 60 miles in 2 hours. That's a speed of 30 miles per hour. For the second half: 60 miles in 1 hour. That's a speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, to find the average speed, can I just take the average of these two speeds? So, (30 + 60) divided by 2, which is 45 miles per hour. Hmm, that's different from the previous calculation where I got 40 miles per hour.\n\nWait, which one is correct? I think there's a confusion here. Average speed is not necessarily the average of the speeds in each segment. It's the total distance over the total time. So, in this case, 120 miles in 3 hours is indeed 40 miles per hour.\n\nBut why is there a difference when I average the two speeds? Oh, I think I see. Averaging the speeds directly assumes that the time spent at each speed is the same, but in reality, the train spent different amounts of time at each speed. So, the correct way is to use the total distance and total time.\n\nLet me confirm this with another approach. Maybe using harmonic mean or something like that.\n\nActually, when dealing with average speeds for equal distances, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nThe formula for harmonic mean of two speeds is:\n\n\\[ \\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times v_1 \\times v_2}{v_1 + v_2} \\]\n\nWhere \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) are the speeds for each half.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times 30 \\times 60}{30 + 60} = \\frac{2 \\times 1800}{90} = \\frac{3600}{90} = 40 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nOkay, so this matches the first calculation I did. So, the correct average speed is 40 miles per hour.\n\nI see now why averaging the speeds directly gave me a different and incorrect answer. It's because the time spent at each speed is different. So, the correct approach is to use total distance over total time or the harmonic mean formula when distances are equal.\n\nSo, the final answer is 40 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
