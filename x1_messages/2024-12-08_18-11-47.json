        "content": "Alright, I'll help you create a simple Java calculator program. We'll make it so that it takes two numbers and an operator from the user, then performs the operation and displays the result. Sounds straightforward, right?\n\nFirst, we need to set up our Java environment. Make sure you have Java installed on your computer. You can download it from oracle.com if you don't have it already.\n\nOnce you have Java set up, open your favorite text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. I'll guide you through writing the code step by step.\n\nSo, let's start by creating a new Java class. We'll call it \"SimpleCalculator\". In Java, every application must have a main class with a main method, which is the entry point of the program.\n\nHere's the basic structure:\n\n```java\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Our code will go here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, we need to get input from the user: two numbers and an operator. In Java, we can use the Scanner class to read input from the console.\n\nFirst, import the Scanner class:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n```\n\nThen, inside the main method, create a Scanner object:\n\n```java\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n```\n\nNext, prompt the user to enter the first number and read it:\n\n```java\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter first number: \");\ndouble num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n```\n\nSimilarly, ask for the second number:\n\n```java\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter second number: \");\ndouble num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n```\n\nAnd now, ask for the operator:\n\n```java\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \");\nchar operator = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n```\n\nHere, we're reading a string and taking its first character as the operator.\n\nNow, depending on the operator, we'll perform different operations. We can use a switch statement for this:\n\n```java\ndouble result;\n\nswitch (operator) {\n    case '+':\n        result = num1 + num2;\n        break;\n    case '-':\n        result = num1 - num2;\n        break;\n    case '*':\n        result = num1 * num2;\n        break;\n    case '/':\n        if (num2 != 0) {\n            result = num1 / num2;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero.\");\n            return;\n        }\n        break;\n    default:\n        System.out.println(\"Invalid operator.\");\n        return;\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n```\n\nLet's go through this:\n\n- We declare a variable 'result' to store the result of the operation.\n\n- Using a switch statement, we check the value of the operator.\n\n- For each case (+, -, *, /), we perform the corresponding operation and assign the result.\n\n- In the division case, we add a check to make sure the second number isn't zero to avoid division by zero error.\n\n- If the operator doesn't match any of the cases, we print an error message and exit the program.\n\nFinally, we print the result.\n\nThat's pretty much it! Let's put all the code together:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter first number: \");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter second number: \");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \");\n        char operator = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n\n        double result;\n\n        switch (operator) {\n            case '+':\n                result = num1 + num2;\n                break;\n            case '-':\n                result = num1 - num2;\n                break;\n            case '*':\n                result = num1 * num2;\n                break;\n            case '/':\n                if (num2 != 0) {\n                    result = num1 / num2;\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero.\");\n                    return;\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid operator.\");\n                return;\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo run this program, save it with the name \"SimpleCalculator.java\", then compile it using the Java compiler (javac) and run the compiled class file (java SimpleCalculator).\n\nThat should do it! You now have a simple calculator in Java that can perform basic arithmetic operations. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
