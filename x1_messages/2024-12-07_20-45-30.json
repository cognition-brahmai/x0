        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: There's a box with red balls and blue balls. If I pick two balls at random without putting them back, the chance that both are red is 1/3. I need to find the smallest total number of balls possible in the box.\n\nOkay, first things first. Let's denote some variables to make sense of this. Let's say there are R red balls and B blue balls in the box. So, the total number of balls is R + B.\n\nNow, the probability of picking two red balls without replacement is given by the formula:\n\nP(two red) = (R / (R + B)) * ((R - 1) / (R + B - 1))\n\nAnd we know that this equals 1/3.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(R / (R + B)) * ((R - 1) / (R + B - 1)) = 1/3\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible value of R + B, given that R and B are positive integers (since there are both red and blue balls).\n\nHmm, this looks like a Diophantine equation problem, where we need integer solutions.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to make it easier to work with.\n\nFirst, cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:\n\n3 * R * (R - 1) = (R + B) * (R + B - 1)\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: 3R(R - 1) = 3R^2 - 3R\n\nRight side: (R + B)(R + B - 1) = (R + B)^2 - (R + B) = R^2 + 2R B + B^2 - R - B\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n3R^2 - 3R = R^2 + 2R B + B^2 - R - B\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\n3R^2 - 3R - R^2 - 2R B - B^2 + R + B = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(3R^2 - R^2) + (-3R + R) - 2R B - B^2 + B = 0\n\nSo:\n\n2R^2 - 2R B - 2R - B^2 + B = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 red balls is C(R, 2) = R(R-1)/2.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 2 balls is C(R + B, 2) = (R + B)(R + B - 1)/2.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\nP = [R(R-1)/2] / [(R + B)(R + B - 1)/2] = R(R-1)/[(R + B)(R + B - 1)] = 1/3\n\nSo, again, we have:\n\nR(R - 1) / [(R + B)(R + B - 1)] = 1/3\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n3R(R - 1) = (R + B)(R + B - 1)\n\nThis is the same equation as before.\n\nMaybe I can express B in terms of R.\n\nLet me denote T = R + B, then B = T - R.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n3R(R - 1) = T(T - 1)\n\nBut T = R + B, and B = T - R, but that doesn't directly help.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that T = R + B, and we're trying to minimize T.\n\nSo, I need to find integer values of R and B such that 3R(R - 1) = T(T - 1), with T = R + B.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I can look for small integer solutions by testing values of R and see if T comes out to be an integer, given that B = T - R must also be a positive integer.\n\nLet's try R = 2.\n\nThen:\n\n3*2*(2 - 1) = 3*2*1 = 6\n\nT(T - 1) = 6\n\nSo, T^2 - T - 6 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation:\n\nT = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 24)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 5]/2\n\nT = 3 or T = -2 (discarding negative)\n\nSo, T = 3\n\nThen, B = T - R = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nSo, total balls are 3: 2 red and 1 blue.\n\nLet me check if this satisfies the original probability.\n\nP(two red) = (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/3\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nBut is this the smallest possible? Let's check R = 1.\n\nR = 1:\n\n3*1*(1 - 1) = 3*1*0 = 0\n\nT(T - 1) = 0\n\nSo, T = 0 or T = 1\n\nBut T = R + B, and R = 1, so B would have to be -1 or 0.\n\nBut B must be at least 1, since there are blue balls. Wait, the problem says \"red balls and blue balls\", so there must be at least one of each.\n\nSo, R = 1, B = 1: T = 2\n\nBut earlier, T(T - 1) = 0, but T = 2 would give 2*1 = 2, which is not equal to 0.\n\nSo, R = 1 doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, R = 2, B = 1, total 3 balls is a possible solution.\n\nLet me check if there's a smaller T.\n\nWait, T = 3 is already quite small, but maybe there's a smaller T with different R and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple solutions, and I need to find the minimal T.\n\nLet me try R = 3.\n\nR = 3:\n\n3*3*2 = 18\n\nT(T - 1) = 18\n\nT^2 - T - 18 = 0\n\nT = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 72)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(73)] / 2\n\nSquare root of 73 is approximately 8.54, which is not an integer.\n\nSo, T is not an integer in this case.\n\nThus, R = 3 doesn't give an integer T.\n\nNext, R = 4.\n\n3*4*3 = 36\n\nT(T - 1) = 36\n\nT^2 - T - 36 = 0\n\nT = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 144)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(145)] / 2\n\nSquare root of 145 is approximately 12.04, not integer.\n\nSo, no integer T for R = 4.\n\nR = 5:\n\n3*5*4 = 60\n\nT(T - 1) = 60\n\nT^2 - T - 60 = 0\n\nT = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 240)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(241)] / 2\n\nSquare root of 241 is approximately 15.52, not integer.\n\nNo solution for R = 5.\n\nR = 6:\n\n3*6*5 = 90\n\nT(T - 1) = 90\n\nT^2 - T - 90 = 0\n\nT = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 360)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(361)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 19]/2\n\nT = 10 or T = -9 (discard)\n\nSo, T = 10\n\nThen, B = T - R = 10 - 6 = 4\n\nSo, total balls are 10: 6 red and 4 blue.\n\nLet me check the probability:\n\nP(two red) = (6/10)*(5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, another possible solution is 10 balls: 6 red and 4 blue.\n\nBut we already have a smaller solution with 3 balls: 2 red and 1 blue.\n\nLet me try R = 7.\n\n3*7*6 = 126\n\nT(T - 1) = 126\n\nT^2 - T - 126 = 0\n\nT = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 504)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(505)] / 2\n\nSquare root of 505 is approximately 22.47, not integer.\n\nNo solution for R = 7.\n\nR = 8:\n\n3*8*7 = 168\n\nT(T - 1) = 168\n\nT^2 - T - 168 = 0\n\nT = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 672)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(673)] / 2\n\nSquare root of 673 is approximately 25.94, not integer.\n\nNo solution.\n\nR = 9:\n\n3*9*8 = 216\n\nT(T - 1) = 216\n\nT^2 - T - 216 = 0\n\nT = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 864)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(865)] / 2\n\nSquare root of 865 is approximately 29.41, not integer.\n\nNo solution.\n\nR = 10:\n\n3*10*9 = 270\n\nT(T - 1) = 270\n\nT^2 - T - 270 = 0\n\nT = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 1080)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1081)] / 2\n\nSquare root of 1081 is approximately 32.88, not integer.\n\nNo solution.\n\nIt seems like for R > 2, only R = 6 gives T = 10 as another solution.\n\nBut earlier, R = 2 gives T = 3, which is smaller.\n\nLet me check if there are any other small R values I might have missed.\n\nR = 0: Not acceptable, as there must be at least one red ball.\n\nR = 1: Leads to T = 3, but as we saw earlier, B = 1, but T = 2, which doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\nWait, earlier I thought R = 1 doesn't work, but let's double-check.\n\nFor R = 1:\n\n3*1*0 = 0\n\nT(T - 1) = 0\n\nSo, T = 0 or T = 1\n\nBut T = R + B, and R = 1, so B = T - 1.\n\nIf T = 1, then B = 0, which isn't acceptable since there must be at least one blue ball.\n\nIf T = 0, B = -1, which is impossible.\n\nHence, R = 1 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible T is 3, with R = 2 and B = 1.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to confirm that there are no smaller solutions.\n\nGiven that T must be at least 2 (since we're picking 2 balls), and R must be at least 2 (to have two red balls), the minimal T is 3.\n\nAlternatively, suppose T = 3, R = 2, B = 1, which we've already confirmed works.\n\nIf T = 4, possible distributions are R = 2, B = 2 or R = 3, B = 1.\n\nLet's check R = 2, B = 2:\n\nP(two red) = (2/4)*(1/3) = 1/6, which is not 1/3.\n\nR = 3, B = 1:\n\nP(two red) = (3/4)*(2/3) = 1/2, which is not 1/3.\n\nSo, T = 4 doesn't work.\n\nT = 5:\n\nPossible R values: 2, 3, or 4.\n\nR = 2, B = 3:\n\nP(two red) = (2/5)*(1/4) = 1/10 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 3, B = 2:\n\nP(two red) = (3/5)*(2/4) = 3/10 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 4, B = 1:\n\nP(two red) = (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5 \u2260 1/3\n\nNo solution for T = 5.\n\nT = 6:\n\nR = 3, B = 3:\n\nP(two red) = (3/6)*(2/5) = 1/5 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 4, B = 2:\n\nP(two red) = (4/6)*(3/5) = 12/30 = 2/5 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 5, B = 1:\n\nP(two red) = (5/6)*(4/5) = 4/6 = 2/3 \u2260 1/3\n\nNo solution for T = 6.\n\nT = 7:\n\nR = 3, B = 4:\n\nP(two red) = (3/7)*(2/6) = 1/7 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 4, B = 3:\n\nP(two red) = (4/7)*(3/6) = 12/42 = 2/7 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 5, B = 2:\n\nP(two red) = (5/7)*(4/6) = 20/42 = 10/21 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 6, B = 1:\n\nP(two red) = (6/7)*(5/6) = 5/7 \u2260 1/3\n\nNo solution for T = 7.\n\nT = 8:\n\nR = 4, B = 4:\n\nP(two red) = (4/8)*(3/7) = 3/14 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 5, B = 3:\n\nP(two red) = (5/8)*(4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 6, B = 2:\n\nP(two red) = (6/8)*(5/7) = 30/56 = 15/28 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 7, B = 1:\n\nP(two red) = (7/8)*(6/7) = 6/8 = 3/4 \u2260 1/3\n\nNo solution for T = 8.\n\nT = 9:\n\nR = 4, B = 5:\n\nP(two red) = (4/9)*(3/8) = 12/72 = 1/6 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 5, B = 4:\n\nP(two red) = (5/9)*(4/8) = 20/72 = 5/18 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 6, B = 3:\n\nP(two red) = (6/9)*(5/8) = 30/72 = 5/12 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 7, B = 2:\n\nP(two red) = (7/9)*(6/8) = 42/72 = 7/12 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 8, B = 1:\n\nP(two red) = (8/9)*(7/8) = 7/9 \u2260 1/3\n\nNo solution for T = 9.\n\nT = 10:\n\nR = 6, B = 4:\n\nP(two red) = (6/10)*(5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3\n\nYes, this works.\n\nSo, another solution is T = 10, R = 6, B = 4.\n\nBut our earlier solution with T = 3, R = 2, B = 1 also works, and T = 3 is smaller than T = 10.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of balls in the box is 3: 2 red and 1 blue.\n\nLet me see if there are any other solutions for larger T.\n\nT = 11:\n\nR = 5, B = 6:\n\nP(two red) = (5/11)*(4/10) = 20/110 = 2/11 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 6, B = 5:\n\nP(two red) = (6/11)*(5/10) = 30/110 = 3/11 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 7, B = 4:\n\nP(two red) = (7/11)*(6/10) = 42/110 = 21/55 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 8, B = 3:\n\nP(two red) = (8/11)*(7/10) = 56/110 = 28/55 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 9, B = 2:\n\nP(two red) = (9/11)*(8/10) = 72/110 = 36/55 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 10, B = 1:\n\nP(two red) = (10/11)*(9/10) = 90/110 = 9/11 \u2260 1/3\n\nNo solution for T = 11.\n\nT = 12:\n\nR = 6, B = 6:\n\nP(two red) = (6/12)*(5/11) = 30/132 = 5/22 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 7, B = 5:\n\nP(two red) = (7/12)*(6/11) = 42/132 = 7/22 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 8, B = 4:\n\nP(two red) = (8/12)*(7/11) = 56/132 = 14/33 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 9, B = 3:\n\nP(two red) = (9/12)*(8/11) = 72/132 = 18/33 = 6/11 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 10, B = 2:\n\nP(two red) = (10/12)*(9/11) = 90/132 = 15/22 \u2260 1/3\n\nR = 11, B = 1:\n\nP(two red) = (11/12)*(10/11) = 110/132 = 10/12 = 5/6 \u2260 1/3\n\nNo solution for T = 12.\n\nIt seems like the only smaller solution is T = 3, and larger solutions exist at T = 10, but since 3 is smaller, it's the minimal.\n\nWait a second, maybe I can find a general solution.\n\nWe have:\n\n3R(R - 1) = T(T - 1)\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\nT^2 - T - 3R^2 + 3R = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in T, and for T to be integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\nDiscriminant D = 1 + 12R^2 - 12R\n\nD must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, D = K^2 for some integer K.\n\nTherefore:\n\n1 + 12R(R - 1) = K^2\n\nLet me see for R = 2:\n\n1 + 12*2*1 = 1 + 24 = 25, which is 5^2. Yes, works.\n\nFor R = 6:\n\n1 + 12*6*5 = 1 + 360 = 361, which is 19^2. Yes, works.\n\nFor R = 2 and R = 6, it works.\n\nLet me see for R = 3:\n\n1 + 12*3*2 = 1 + 72 = 73, which is not a perfect square.\n\nR = 4:\n\n1 + 12*4*3 = 1 + 144 = 145, not a perfect square.\n\nR = 5:\n\n1 + 12*5*4 = 1 + 240 = 241, not a perfect square.\n\nR = 7:\n\n1 + 12*7*6 = 1 + 504 = 505, not a perfect square.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, it seems like only R = 2 and R = 6 (and possibly higher values of R) give integer T.\n\nTherefore, the minimal T is 3, with R = 2 and B = 1.\n\nLet me see if there's a recursive formula or a pattern to find more solutions.\n\nSuppose I consider the equation:\n\nT^2 - T = 3R^2 - 3R\n\nOr T(T - 1) = 3R(R - 1)\n\nThis looks similar to the relationship between triangular numbers and some multiple of another triangular number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to parameterize the solutions.\n\nLet me consider that T and R are related through a recursive sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for solutions where T and R are related by a certain ratio.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating things.\n\nGiven that the problem asks for the minimal number of balls, and we've found that T = 3 works, and T = 10 also works, but T = 3 is smaller, I think it's safe to conclude that the minimal number of balls is 3.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's check if there are any other small solutions that I might have missed.\n\nSuppose T = 4, but we already checked that and found no solution.\n\nT = 5: no solution.\n\nT = 6: no solution.\n\nT = 7: no solution.\n\nT = 8: no solution.\n\nT = 9: no solution.\n\nT = 10: solution found with R = 6, B = 4.\n\nT = 11: no solution.\n\nT = 12: no solution.\n\nSo, the only smaller solution is T = 3.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of balls in the box is 3: 2 red and 1 blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
