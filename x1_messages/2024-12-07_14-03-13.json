        "content": "FADE IN:\n\nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT - 1920S\n\nThe city is alive with the hum of prohibition-era life. Neon signs flicker above speakeasy doors, and the sound of jazz floats through the air. Taxi cabs zip by, their headlights cutting through the smoky atmosphere.\n\nINT. SPEAKEASY - NIGHT\n\nA dimly lit room filled with the sounds of laughter and clinking glasses. The smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke fills the air. At the center of the room, a small stage hosts a jazz band, led by a charismatic singer, LUCY (late 20s, elegant yet tough, with a voice that could melt steel).\n\nLUCY\n\n(singing)\n\n\"Midnight calls my name,\n\nIn this city of sin and fame.\n\nWith every note I sing,\n\nI feel the world begin to swing.\"\n\nThe audience is entranced, swaying to the rhythm. Suddenly, the door bursts open, and a group of men in suits enters, their faces stern. It's the POLICE.\n\nPOLICE CAPTAIN\n\n(calling out)\n\n\"Everybody freeze! This is a dry raid!\"\n\nPanic ensues. People scatter, trying to escape through back doors. The band members look around, unsure what to do.\n\nLUCY\n\n(keeping calm)\n\n\"Keep playing, guys. It's just another night in the city.\"\n\nThe band hesitates but starts playing again, trying to maintain the facade of normalcy.\n\nINT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT\n\nLucy slips into a back room, where a man, JAKE (early 30s, ruggedly handsome, with a scar above his left eyebrow), is counting stacks of cash on a table. He looks up as Lucy enters.\n\nJAKE\n\n\"Lucy, what's wrong?\"\n\nLUCY\n\n\"The cops are here. We need to get out of here fast.\"\n\nJAKE\n\n(nodding)\n\n\"I've got an exit plan. Follow me.\"\n\nThey make their way through a secret passage behind a bookshelf, which leads to an alleyway behind the speakeasy.\n\nEXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT\n\nThey emerge into the dark alley, filled with trash cans and shadows. Lucy and Jake hurry away from the speakeasy, trying to blend in with the night.\n\nLUCY\n\n(whispering)\n\n\"Thanks, Jake. I owe you one.\"\n\nJAKE\n\n(smiling)\n\n\"Anything for you, Lucy. Now, let's get you somewhere safe.\"\n\nThey walk a few blocks until they reach a run-down apartment building. Jake leads Lucy up the stairs to a small apartment.\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe apartment is sparse but clean, with a few pieces of furniture and a bed pushed against the wall. Lucy sits down, visibly shaken.\n\nLUCY\n\n\"I can't keep doing this, Jake. The risk is getting too high.\"\n\nJAKE\n\n(sitting next to her)\n\n\"I know, Lucy. But you're the best singer in the city. You can't just quit now.\"\n\nLUCY\n\n\"Maybe I should consider a different path. Something safer.\"\n\nJAKE\n\n(concerned)\n\n\"What are you talking about? You have talent, Lucy. You deserve to shine.\"\n\nLUCY\n\n\"Shining comes at a price, Jake. And lately, it feels like the price is getting too high.\"\n\nJake takes her hand, looking into her eyes.\n\nJAKE\n\n\"I won't let anything happen to you, Lucy. I promise.\"\n\nLucy smiles weakly, appreciating his concern.\n\nLUCY\n\n\"You're a good man, Jake. Now, tell me, how's business?\"\n\nJAKE\n\n(shrugging)\n\n\"Same as always. Bootlegging pays the bills.\"\n\nLUCY\n\n\"You know it's dangerous, right? The cops are getting smarter.\"\n\nJAKE\n\n\"Hey, I've been doing this for years. I know how to stay one step ahead.\"\n\nLucy looks skeptical but doesn't press further.\n\nLUCY\n\n\"Anyway, thanks again for helping me tonight. I don't know what I would've done if I got caught.\"\n\nJAKE\n\n\"It's no problem, Lucy. Now, why don't you get some rest? You've had a long night.\"\n\nLucy nods and lies down on the bed. Jake covers her with a blanket and turns to leave.\n\nLUCY\n\n(waiting)\n\n\"Jake?\"\n\nJAKE\n\n(young)\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\nLUCY\n\n\"Stay with me tonight. Just until I fall asleep.\"\n\nJake hesitates for a moment but then nods, sitting down on a chair beside the bed.\n\nJAKE\n\n\"Alright, Lucy. I'll stay.\"\n\nThey share a moment of silence, the only sound being Lucy's breathing as she drifts off to sleep.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\n\n"
