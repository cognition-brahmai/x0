        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units of product A every hour. It works for 8 hours each day and runs 5 days a week. I need to find out how many units are made in one week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are made in one day. Since it makes 500 units per hour and works 8 hours a day, I can multiply 500 by 8 to get the daily production.\n\n500 units/hour * 8 hours/day = 4,000 units/day\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 4,000 units each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days it operates in a week. It runs 5 days a week, so:\n\n4,000 units/day * 5 days/week = 20,000 units/week\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 20,000 units of product A in one week.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- Units per hour: 500\n\n- Hours per day: 8\n\n- Days per week: 5\n\nFirst, units per day: 500 * 8 = 4,000\n\nThen, units per week: 4,000 * 5 = 20,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as total hours per week and then multiply by units per hour.\n\nTotal hours per week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week\n\nThen, units per week: 500 units/hour * 40 hours/week = 20,000 units/week\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think 20,000 units per week is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20000} \\]"
