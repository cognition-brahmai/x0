        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in the room. 90% of them wear glasses, and 75% wear hats. I need to find the minimum number of people who wear both glasses and hats.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many people wear glasses and how many wear hats.\n\n90% of 100 people wear glasses, so that's:\n\n0.9 * 100 = 90 people wear glasses.\n\n75% of 100 people wear hats, so that's:\n\n0.75 * 100 = 75 people wear hats.\n\nNow, I need to find the minimum number of people who wear both glasses and hats.\n\nI think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection.\n\nIn formula terms:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nIn this context:\n\n- A is the set of people who wear glasses.\n\n- B is the set of people who wear hats.\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the number of people who wear either glasses or hats or both.\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of people who wear both glasses and hats.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for |A \u2229 B|:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u222a B|\n\nTo find the minimum number of people who wear both, I need to maximize |A \u222a B| because the larger |A \u222a B| is, the smaller |A \u2229 B| will be.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible value of |A \u222a B|?\n\nWell, there are only 100 people in the room, so |A \u222a B| can be at most 100.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n|A \u2229 B| = 90 + 75 - 100 = 165 - 100 = 65\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of people who wear both glasses and hats is 65.\n\nBut wait, is that the minimum? Let me think again.\n\nActually, the minimum overlap would be when as many people as possible are only wearing one of the items.\n\nBut in this case, since 90 people wear glasses and 75 wear hats, the total number of people wearing either glasses or hats or both would be at most 100.\n\nSo, the equation makes sense.\n\nLet me consider it differently.\n\nIf 90 people wear glasses and 75 wear hats, then the total number of glasses and hats combined is 90 + 75 = 165.\n\nBut since there are only 100 people, at least 165 - 100 = 65 people must be counted in both sets, meaning they wear both glasses and hats.\n\nSo, yes, the minimum number of people who wear both is 65.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it with Venn diagrams, I have one circle with 90 people wearing glasses and another circle with 75 people wearing hats.\n\nThe overlapping area represents people who wear both.\n\nTo minimize the overlapping area, I need to maximize the non-overlapping parts within the total of 100 people.\n\nThe non-overlapping part for glasses is 90 - x, and for hats is 75 - x, where x is the number of people who wear both.\n\nThen, the total number of people is:\n\n(90 - x) + (75 - x) + x = 100\n\nSimplifying:\n\n165 - x = 100\n\nSo, x = 65\n\nAgain, this confirms that the minimum number of people who wear both is 65.\n\nLet me try another approach to be sure.\n\nSuppose I want to minimize the number of people who wear both glasses and hats.\n\nTo minimize this, I need as many people as possible to wear only glasses or only hats.\n\nGiven that 90 people wear glasses and 75 wear hats, the maximum number of people who wear only glasses is 90 - x, and only hats is 75 - x, with x being the number who wear both.\n\nThe total number of people is:\n\nOnly glasses + Only hats + Both = (90 - x) + (75 - x) + x = 165 - x\n\nBut the total number of people is 100, so:\n\n165 - x = 100\n\nTherefore, x = 65\n\nOnce again, this confirms that the minimum number of people who wear both is 65.\n\nI think this makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer is 65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]"
