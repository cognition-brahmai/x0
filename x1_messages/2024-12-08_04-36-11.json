        "content": "So, we've got this game where four friends are taking turns rolling a die, and the first one to roll a 6 wins. You want to know the probability that Player 1 wins on their very first turn. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, since it's a standard die, there are six faces, numbered 1 through 6, and each face has an equal chance of landing face up. So, the probability of rolling a 6 on any single roll is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 6 is 5/6.\n\nNow, in this game, there are four players taking turns in order: Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, and Player 4. They keep going in this cycle until someone rolls a 6.\n\nBut the question is specifically about Player 1 winning on their first turn. So, that means Player 1 rolls the die first, and they win if they roll a 6.\n\nGiven that, the probability that Player 1 wins on their first turn is simply the probability that they roll a 6 on their first roll.\n\nSince the die is fair, that probability is just 1/6.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else we need to consider? Like, what if the other players roll after Player 1? But the question is only about Player 1's first turn, which is their first roll, before anyone else has had a turn.\n\nSo, indeed, it's straightforward: the probability is 1/6.\n\nBut let's think about it another way to confirm. Suppose we have four players, and they take turns in order. The game continues until someone rolls a 6.\n\nThe probability that Player 1 wins on their first turn is the probability that they roll a 6 on their first roll.\n\nThe probability that Player 1 does not win on their first turn is 5/6. In that case, the game proceeds to Player 2.\n\nBut since the question is only about Player 1's first turn, we don't need to worry about what happens after that.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Player 1 wins on their first turn is indeed 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, if the question were about the overall probability that Player 1 wins the game, that would involve considering all the possible scenarios where Player 1 rolls a 6 on their first turn, or if no one rolls a 6 in the first round, and the game goes to the second round, and so on.\n\nBut again, the question is specifically about Player 1's first turn, so it's just the probability of rolling a 6 on that first roll.\n\nSo, the answer is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
