        "content": "So I have this problem here about a rectangular garden that's currently 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The task is to increase its area by 50% while keeping it a rectangle. I need to figure out what the new dimensions should be.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the current area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width, right? So, the current area is 30 meters times 20 meters, which is 600 square meters.\n\nNow, I need to increase this area by 50%. To find 50% of 600 square meters, I can calculate 0.5 times 600, which is 300 square meters. So, the new area should be the original area plus this increase, which is 600 plus 300, equaling 900 square meters.\n\nThe problem specifies that the garden should still be a rectangle after the expansion. However, it doesn't say anything about maintaining the same proportions or aspect ratio. That means I have some flexibility in choosing the new length and width, as long as their product is 900 square meters.\n\nBut maybe there's a specific way to increase both dimensions by the same proportion to maintain the shape. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I want to maintain the same shape, I should keep the ratio of length to width constant. The original ratio is 30 meters to 20 meters, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nSo, if I let the new length be 3x meters and the new width be 2x meters, then the area would be 3x times 2x, which is 6x\u00b2 square meters. I set this equal to the desired new area of 900 square meters.\n\nSo, 6x\u00b2 = 900.\n\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 6: x\u00b2 = 150.\n\nThen, take the square root of both sides: x = sqrt(150).\n\nSqrt(150) is sqrt(25*6) = 5*sqrt(6).\n\nSo, x is approximately 5 times 2.449, which is about 12.245 meters.\n\nTherefore, the new length would be 3x, which is approximately 3 times 12.245, equaling about 36.735 meters.\n\nThe new width would be 2x, which is approximately 2 times 12.245, equaling about 24.49 meters.\n\nBut maybe there's a more precise way to calculate this without using approximations.\n\nAlternatively, since the area is increasing by 50%, and I want to maintain the same shape, I can think about scaling both dimensions by the same factor.\n\nLet\u2019s call the scaling factor \u201ck\u201d. So, the new length would be k times the original length, and the new width would be k times the original width.\n\nThe new area would then be (k*30) times (k*20), which is k\u00b2 times the original area.\n\nI want the new area to be 1.5 times the original area, so k\u00b2 times 600 equals 900.\n\nTherefore, k\u00b2 = 900 / 600 = 1.5.\n\nSo, k = sqrt(1.5).\n\nSqrt(1.5) is approximately 1.2247.\n\nTherefore, the new length is approximately 30 * 1.2247 = 36.741 meters.\n\nThe new width is approximately 20 * 1.2247 = 24.494 meters.\n\nThis is consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nBut perhaps I can leave the answer in terms of the square root for exactness.\n\nSince k = sqrt(1.5), and 1.5 is 3/2, then k = sqrt(3/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(2).\n\nI can rationalize the denominator: sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(6)/2.\n\nTherefore, the new length is (sqrt(6)/2)*30 = (30*sqrt(6))/2 = 15*sqrt(6) meters.\n\nSimilarly, the new width is (sqrt(6)/2)*20 = (20*sqrt(6))/2 = 10*sqrt(6) meters.\n\nSo, the exact new dimensions are 15*sqrt(6) meters in length and 10*sqrt(6) meters in width.\n\nIf I need to provide approximate values, I can calculate sqrt(6) \u2248 2.449.\n\nThus, length \u2248 15*2.449 \u2248 36.735 meters.\n\nWidth \u2248 10*2.449 \u2248 24.49 meters.\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions of the garden should be approximately 36.74 meters in length and 24.49 meters in width to increase the area by 50% while maintaining the rectangular shape.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe new dimensions of the garden should be \\boxed{15\\sqrt{6} \\text{ meters in length and } 10\\sqrt{6} \\text{ meters in width}} (approximately 36.74 meters in length and 24.49 meters in width)."
