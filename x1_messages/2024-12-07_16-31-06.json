        "content": "To find out how long it takes for the car to reach City B, we can use the formula for time, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nGiven that the distance between City A and City B is 260 miles and the average speed of the car is 65 mph, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{260 \\text{ miles}}{65 \\text{ mph}} \\]\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, it takes the car 4 hours to reach City B when traveling at an average speed of 65 mph.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Understanding Units:** It's important to ensure that the units for distance and speed are compatible. In this case, miles and miles per hour are compatible, allowing us to get time in hours.\n\n- **Average Speed:** Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. In this problem, it's given as 65 mph, which means the car covers 65 miles every hour on average.\n\n- **Real-World Considerations:** In real-world scenarios, travel time can be affected by factors such as traffic, stops, and varying speeds. However, in this problem, we assume constant average speed for simplicity.\n\n- **Other Calculations:** If you needed to find the distance or speed and had the other two variables, you could rearrange the formula accordingly. For example:\n\n  - To find distance: \\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\n  - To find speed: \\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nThis formula is fundamental in problems involving constant speed and can be applied in various contexts, such as determining how long a journey will take, calculating the speed needed to cover a certain distance in a given time, or finding out the distance traveled at a certain speed over a specific period.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\n\nSuppose the car had traveled at a different average speed, say 52 mph. How would the time change?\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{260 \\text{ miles}}{52 \\text{ mph}} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, at 52 mph, it would take 5 hours to cover the same distance.\n\n**Comparing Speeds and Times:**\n\n- At 65 mph: 4 hours\n\n- At 52 mph: 5 hours\n\nThis shows that increasing speed decreases the time taken to cover the same distance, and vice versa.\n\n**Graphical Representation:**\n\nIf we were to plot speed against time for a fixed distance, we would see an inverse relationship. As speed increases, time decreases, and vice versa.\n\n**Table of Values:**\n\nTo further illustrate, here's a table showing various speeds and the corresponding times to cover 260 miles:\n\n| Speed (mph) | Time (hours) |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| 52          | 5            |\n| 65          | 4            |\n| 78          | 3.333        |\n| 104         | 2.5          |\n| 130         | 2            |\n\nThis table demonstrates that as speed increases, the time required to cover the distance decreases proportionally.\n\n**Unit Conversion:**\n\nIf the speed was given in kilometers per hour (km/h) and the distance in kilometers, the formula would still apply, giving time in hours. For example, if the distance was 418 kilometers (approximately 260 miles) and the speed was 104 km/h:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{418 \\text{ km}}{104 \\text{ km/h}} \\approx 4.02 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThis is roughly the same as the original calculation in miles, confirming the consistency of the formula across different units.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between distance, speed, and time is crucial in many real-world applications, from planning travel itineraries to analyzing motion in physics. The formula \\(\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\\) is a foundational tool in these analyses, providing a straightforward method to calculate any one of these variables when the other two are known."
