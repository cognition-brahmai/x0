        "content": "So there's this problem here. In a class of 30 students, 12 are boys and 18 are girls. The teacher is going to randomly select one student to be the class representative and another student to be the assistant. I need to find out the probability that both positions will be filled by girls.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, there are 30 students in total, with 18 of them being girls. The teacher is selecting two students: one for the representative and another for the assistant. Since it's specified that the selections are random, I can assume that every student has an equal chance of being selected for each position.\n\nNow, the key here is that the selections are done one after the other, and presumably without replacement, meaning the same student can't be both the representative and the assistant. So, once a student is chosen for one position, they can't be chosen for the other.\n\nI need to find the probability that both positions are filled by girls. That means the first selection (for representative) should be a girl, and the second selection (for assistant) should also be a girl.\n\nLet's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what's the probability that the first selected student is a girl?\n\nThere are 18 girls out of 30 students, so the probability should be 18/30.\n\nSimplifying that, 18/30 = 3/5 or 0.6.\n\nOkay, so P(first student is a girl) = 18/30 = 3/5.\n\nNow, given that the first student selected is a girl, what's the probability that the second student selected is also a girl?\n\nIf one girl has already been selected, then there are now 17 girls left out of the remaining 29 students.\n\nSo, P(second student is a girl | first student is a girl) = 17/29.\n\nAlright, now, since these are sequential events, to find the probability that both events happen (both positions are filled by girls), I need to multiply the probabilities of each event happening in sequence.\n\nSo, P both girls = P(first is a girl) * P(second is a girl | first is a girl)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP both girls = (18/30) * (17/29)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 18/30 = 3/5.\n\nThen, 3/5 * 17/29.\n\nMultiplying numerator: 3 * 17 = 51\n\nMultiplying denominator: 5 * 29 = 145\n\nSo, P both girls = 51/145.\n\nHmm, can this fraction be simplified?\n\nLet's see, 51 and 145.\n\nDividing both by 3: 51 \u00f7 3 = 17, 145 \u00f7 3 = 48.333, which is not an integer.\n\nDividing both by 17: 51 \u00f7 17 = 3, 145 \u00f7 17 \u2248 8.529, not an integer.\n\nSo, 51/145 is already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a better sense.\n\n51 \u00f7 145 \u2248 0.3517.\n\nSo, approximately 0.3517, or 35.17%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the format, I can leave it as a fraction.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both positions will be filled by girls is 51/145.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer?\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations.\n\nSince the order of selection matters here (first is representative, second is assistant), this is a permutation problem.\n\nThe number of ways to select 2 girls out of 18, considering order, is P(18,2) = 18 * 17 = 306.\n\nThe total number of ways to select any 2 students out of 30, considering order, is P(30,2) = 30 * 29 = 870.\n\nTherefore, P both girls = 306 / 870.\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n306 \u00f7 6 = 51\n\n870 \u00f7 6 = 145\n\nSo, again, 51/145.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if order didn't matter, but since it does, permutations are appropriate here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use probabilities directly.\n\nThe probability that the first selected is a girl is 18/30.\n\nGiven that, the probability that the second selected is also a girl is 17/29.\n\nMultiplying them gives 18/30 * 17/29 = 51/145.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both positions will be filled by girls is 51/145.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{51}{145}} \\]"
