        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town where:\n\n- 60% of the population owns a car.\n\n- 40% owns a bicycle.\n\n- 20% owns both a car and a bicycle.\n\nAnd we need to find out what percentage doesn't own either a car or a bicycle.\n\nFirst, I think it's helpful to visualize this with a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping: one for car owners and one for bicycle owners.\n\n- The car circle is 60%.\n\n- The bicycle circle is 40%.\n\n- The overlap, where people own both, is 20%.\n\nSo, to find out how many people own at least one of these (either a car or a bicycle or both), we can add the percentages of car owners and bicycle owners and then subtract the overlap because those who own both are counted twice if we just add the two percentages.\n\nMathematically, that's:\n\nNumber owning at least one = (Car owners) + (Bicycle owners) - (Both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber owning at least one = 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%\n\nSo, 80% of the population owns either a car or a bicycle or both.\n\nNow, to find out who doesn't own either, we subtract this from 100%, because 100% is the whole population.\n\nNeither = 100% - 80% = 20%\n\nTherefore, 20% of the population doesn't own either a car or a bicycle.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number of elements in set A (car owners).\n\n- n(B) is the number of elements in set B (bicycle owners).\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number of elements in both sets (own both).\n\nSo, the percentage that owns either a car or a bicycle or both is:\n\n60% + 40% - 20% = 80%\n\nAgain, subtracting from 100% gives us 20% who own neither.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of probabilities or proportions.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the population as 100 people to make it easier.\n\n- 60 people own a car.\n\n- 40 own a bicycle.\n\n- 20 own both.\n\nSo, the number of people who own only a car is 60 - 20 = 40.\n\nThe number who own only a bicycle is 40 - 20 = 20.\n\nThe number who own both is 20.\n\nAdding these up: 40 (only car) + 20 (only bicycle) + 20 (both) = 80 people own at least one mode of transportation.\n\nTherefore, 100 - 80 = 20 people own neither.\n\nSo, 20% of the population doesn't own either a car or a bicycle.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use a formula for the complement.\n\nThe percentage that doesn't own a car is 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nThe percentage that doesn't own a bicycle is 100% - 40% = 60%.\n\nBut simply multiplying these wouldn't make sense because ownership of a car and a bicycle aren't independent events here.\n\nWait, actually, in probability, to find the probability of neither, we can multiply the probabilities of not owning each, but only if they are independent.\n\nIn this case, since we know that owning both is 20%, which isn't equal to the product of not owning each, it suggests that owning a car and owning a bicycle are not independent events.\n\nTherefore, it's better to stick with the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a contingency table or a Euler diagram, but the calculations would lead to the same conclusion.\n\nSo, confidently, the answer is 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
