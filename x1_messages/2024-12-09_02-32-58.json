        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. We've got 25 students and a test with 10 questions. Each student answers at least one question correctly. We need to find the maximum number of questions that can have been answered correctly by exactly 9 students.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We want as many questions as possible to have exactly 9 correct answers from the students. So, for each of these questions, 9 students got it right, and the remaining 16 students got it wrong.\n\nBut there are 10 questions, and 25 students, and each student answers at least one question correctly. We need to maximize the number of questions that have exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nLet me think about this. If a question is answered correctly by exactly 9 students, that means 9 students got it right and 16 got it wrong. So, for each such question, 9 students have at least one correct answer, which they already have to have because every student answers at least one question correctly.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the students' correct answers are distributed in such a way that as many questions as possible have exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nMaybe I can start by assuming that k questions have exactly 9 correct answers each. Then, the remaining (10 - k) questions can have any number of correct answers, but I need to ensure that every student has at least one correct answer.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the questions as Q1, Q2, ..., Q10.\n\nSuppose that the first k questions each have exactly 9 students who answered them correctly.\n\nSo, for Q1, 9 students got it right; for Q2, another 9 students got it right, and so on up to Qk.\n\nNow, the remaining (10 - k) questions can have any number of correct answers, but I need to make sure that every student has at least one correct answer.\n\nMoreover, I need to maximize k, the number of questions with exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nBut there might be overlapping in the students who got multiple questions correct.\n\nLet me think about the total number of correct answers.\n\nEach of the k questions has 9 correct answers, so that's 9k correct answers from these questions.\n\nThen, the remaining (10 - k) questions can have any number of correct answers, but I need to make sure that the total number of correct answers covers all 25 students, since each student has at least one correct answer.\n\nWait, but actually, the students might have multiple correct answers, so the total number of correct answers could be more than 25.\n\nBut I need to ensure that no question outside the k questions has exactly 9 correct answers, because I want only k questions to have exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nWait, no, the problem is to maximize the number of questions that have exactly 9 correct answers, so perhaps some of the remaining (10 - k) questions can also have exactly 9 correct answers, but I want to maximize k, so perhaps I should allow the remaining questions to have fewer or more than 9 correct answers, but not exactly 9, to maximize k.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the maximum number of questions that can have been answered correctly by exactly 9 students.\"\n\nSo, I need to maximize k, the number of questions with exactly 9 correct answers, and the remaining questions can have any number of correct answers except exactly 9.\n\nWait, no, the remaining questions can have any number of correct answers, including exactly 9, but I want to maximize k, the number of questions with exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nWait, but if I allow the remaining questions to have exactly 9 correct answers, then k wouldn't be maximized because k is the number of questions with exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to ensure that only k questions have exactly 9 correct answers, and the remaining questions have a different number of correct answers.\n\nBut I think the problem is to maximize k, the number of questions with exactly 9 correct answers, and the remaining questions can have any number of correct answers, including exactly 9.\n\nBut if I allow the remaining questions to have exactly 9 correct answers, then k isn't maximized because k is the number of questions with exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me rephrase: I need to find the maximum number of questions that have exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nSo, some questions have exactly 9 correct answers, and the rest can have any number of correct answers, but I need to maximize the number of questions that have exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nSo, I need to arrange the correct answers in such a way that as many questions as possible have exactly 9 correct answers, while ensuring that every student has at least one correct answer.\n\nLet me consider the total number of correct answers needed.\n\nThere are 25 students, each with at least one correct answer, so there are at least 25 correct answers in total.\n\nBut students can have multiple correct answers, so the total number of correct answers can be more than 25.\n\nNow, if I have k questions, each with exactly 9 correct answers, that accounts for 9k correct answers.\n\nThe remaining (10 - k) questions can have any number of correct answers.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the total number of correct answers covers all students, i.e., the total number of correct answers is at least 25.\n\nBut actually, since students can have multiple correct answers, the total number of correct answers can be more than 25.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that no student is left without at least one correct answer.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose I have k questions, each with exactly 9 distinct students answering correctly.\n\nSo, for Q1, 9 students get it right; for Q2, another 9 students get it right, and so on.\n\nBut if the students are overlapping, then some students might have multiple correct answers.\n\nIn this case, to maximize k, I need to minimize the overlap between the students who got different questions correct.\n\nWait, but if I minimize the overlap, then more students will have multiple correct answers, which is fine as long as every student has at least one correct answer.\n\nBut I have 25 students, and each of the k questions has 9 students who got it correct.\n\nSo, the total number of student-question correct pairs is 9k.\n\nBut some students might be counted multiple times if they got correct answers in multiple questions.\n\nNow, the total number of distinct students who have at least one correct answer is at least 25.\n\nWait, actually, it has to be exactly 25, since there are 25 students in total.\n\nSo, the union of all students who got at least one question correct is the entire class of 25 students.\n\nNow, I need to maximize k, the number of questions with exactly 9 correct answers, under the constraint that the union of all students who got these questions correct covers all 25 students.\n\nSo, I need to cover 25 students with k questions, each covering exactly 9 students, and possibly overlapping.\n\nI need to find the maximum k such that the union of these k questions covers all 25 students.\n\nThis sounds like a set covering problem.\n\nIn set covering, we have a universe of elements (here, 25 students), and a collection of sets (here, questions, each with exactly 9 students), and we want to cover the entire universe with as few sets as possible.\n\nBut in this problem, we want to maximize the number of sets (questions) while covering the universe.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory.\n\nActually, in set covering, the goal is usually to cover the universe with as few sets as possible.\n\nBut here, we want to use as many sets as possible, each covering exactly 9 elements, while covering the entire universe of 25 students.\n\nSo, it's somewhat the opposite of the standard set covering problem.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nIf each question covers exactly 9 students, and I have k such questions, then the total number of student-question pairs is 9k.\n\nBut some students may be covered multiple times.\n\nThe total number of distinct students covered is at least the minimum of (9k, 25), but since we can't have more than 25 distinct students, we need to ensure that the union covers all 25 students.\n\nSo, the minimum number of questions needed to cover all 25 students, with each question covering exactly 9 students, would be ceil(25/9) = 3 questions.\n\nBecause 2 questions cover at most 18 students (if there is no overlap), and 3 questions can cover up to 27 students, which is more than enough for 25 students.\n\nBut we want to maximize k, so perhaps more than 3 questions can be used, as long as some students are covered multiple times.\n\nWait, but if I have more than 3 questions, some students will be covered multiple times, which is allowed, as long as every student is covered at least once.\n\nSo, the question is, what is the maximum k such that 9k is at least 25, and the covering is possible.\n\nWait, but actually, 9k needs to be at least 25, because each student needs at least one correct answer, and the total number of correct answers is at least 25.\n\nBut in reality, since students can have multiple correct answers, 9k can be greater than 25.\n\nBut I need to ensure that every student is covered at least once.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of subsets of size 9 from a set of 25 elements, such that their union is the entire set.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact combinatorial approach here.\n\nLet me consider the extreme case where k is as large as possible.\n\nIf k = 10, meaning all 10 questions have exactly 9 correct answers, then the total number of student-question pairs is 90.\n\nBut with 25 students, that would mean on average each student has 90/25 = 3.6 correct answers.\n\nBut is it possible to have all 10 questions each with exactly 9 correct answers, while covering all 25 students?\n\nI need to check if it's possible to distribute the correct answers in such a way.\n\nLet me think about the minimum number of questions needed to cover all 25 students, with each question covering exactly 9 students.\n\nAs I thought earlier, ceil(25/9) = 3 questions are needed minimally.\n\nBut perhaps with more questions, I can still maintain that each question has exactly 9 correct answers, while covering all students.\n\nSo, if I have k = 3 questions, each covering 9 students, with no overlap, that would cover 27 students, which is more than 25, but since there are only 25 students, some students would be covered multiple times.\n\nWait, no, if there are no overlaps, and each question covers 9 distinct students, then the total number of distinct students covered would be 27, which is impossible since there are only 25 students.\n\nTherefore, there must be some overlap.\n\nSo, with k = 3 questions, each covering 9 students, and overlapping appropriately, it's possible to cover all 25 students.\n\nBut I want to maximize k.\n\nSo, perhaps I can have k = 4 questions, each with 9 students, and adjust the overlaps to cover all 25 students.\n\nLet me see.\n\nWith k = 4 questions, each covering 9 students, the total number of student-question pairs is 36.\n\nIf the overlaps are managed such that the union covers all 25 students, then k = 4 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 5, total student-question pairs would be 45.\n\nStill possible to cover 25 students.\n\nAnd so on, up to k = 10.\n\nBut I need to ensure that with k questions, each having exactly 9 students answering correctly, the union of these students covers all 25 students.\n\nI need to find the maximum k for which this is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a constraint based on the total number of student-question pairs.\n\nWait, but with k = 10, total student-question pairs would be 90, which is way more than enough to cover 25 students.\n\nBut the problem is not just about the total number of pairs, but about the way the students are distributed across the questions.\n\nI need to ensure that every student is covered by at least one question, and that each question covers exactly 9 students.\n\nThis seems like a problem in combinatorial design, possibly related to block designs.\n\nIn combinatorial design, a block design is a set of elements (students) and a collection of subsets (questions), each of a specified size, such that certain properties are satisfied.\n\nIn this case, I have a set of 25 students, and I want to cover them with subsets (questions) of size 9, and I want to maximize the number of such subsets, while ensuring that the union covers all students.\n\nThis sounds similar to a covering design, where the goal is to cover all elements with as few subsets as possible, but in this case, I want to use as many subsets as possible, each of size 9, while covering all students.\n\nBut there must be some limit to how many such subsets I can have.\n\nLet me consider the maximum possible k.\n\nIf each question covers 9 students, and there are 25 students, then the maximum k would be floor(25/9) = 2 questions, but that only covers 18 students.\n\nBut wait, 2 questions can cover at most 18 students without overlap.\n\nBut we have 25 students, so we need at least ceil(25/9) = 3 questions.\n\nBut if I have 3 questions, each covering 9 students, and the overlaps are such that the total number of distinct students covered is 25, then k = 3 is possible.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize k, so perhaps I can have more than 3 questions, each covering 9 students, while still covering all 25 students.\n\nFor example, if I have k = 4 questions, each covering 9 students, and the overlaps are such that the total number of distinct students is 25, then k = 4 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 5, and so on.\n\nBut there must be a limit to how many such questions I can have.\n\nLet me think about it in terms of the total number of student-question pairs.\n\nEach question has 9 students, so k questions have 9k student-question pairs.\n\nBut each student can be counted multiple times, but must be counted at least once.\n\nSo, the total number of student-question pairs must be at least 25.\n\nBut in practice, since students can be counted multiple times, 9k can be greater than 25.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the coverage is such that all students are included.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this using linear algebra or inclusion-exclusion principles.\n\nLet me consider the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe union of k sets, each of size 9, with possible overlaps, should cover 25 students.\n\nBut inclusion-exclusion can get complicated with multiple overlaps.\n\nMaybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me consider the minimal number of questions needed to cover all students.\n\nAs previously determined, ceil(25/9) = 3 questions are needed minimally.\n\nBut I can have more questions, as long as their unions still cover all students.\n\nSo, perhaps k can be up to 10, but I need to check if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a constraint based on the total number of student-question pairs and the number of students.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at it from the perspective of the students.\n\nEach student must be in at least one question.\n\nIf there are k questions, each with 9 students, then the total number of student-question pairs is 9k.\n\nBut since each student is in at least one question, and possibly more, the average number of questions per student is 9k / 25.\n\nBut since each student must be in at least one question, 9k must be at least 25.\n\nSo, k must be at least ceil(25/9) = 3.\n\nBut we are trying to maximize k, so we need to see what is the maximum k such that it's possible to distribute the students among the questions, with each question having exactly 9 students, and every student being in at least one question.\n\nPerhaps I can think about the maximum matching or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the complement: how many questions can have not exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nLet me consider a different approach.\n\nSuppose I fix k questions, each with exactly 9 students answering correctly.\n\nThen, the remaining (10 - k) questions can have any number of correct answers, but I need to ensure that every student has at least one correct answer.\n\nTo maximize k, I need to minimize the number of questions needed to cover the remaining students not covered by the k questions.\n\nWait, but actually, the k questions are already covering the students, and the remaining questions can cover any students, including those already covered by the k questions.\n\nBut I need to make sure that all students are covered by at least one question.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the k questions as a subset of the 10 questions, each with exactly 9 students answering correctly, and the remaining (10 - k) questions can have any number of correct answers.\n\nBut I need to maximize k, so I need to see how many questions can be in this subset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this using graphs.\n\nLet me consider a bipartite graph where one set of nodes represents the students and the other set represents the questions.\n\nAn edge between a student and a question indicates that the student answered that question correctly.\n\nSo, in this graph, each question node should have exactly 9 neighbors (since each question is answered correctly by exactly 9 students), and each student node should have at least one neighbor.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the number of question nodes that have exactly 9 neighbors.\n\nBut this seems complex to analyze directly.\n\nMaybe I can consider the total number of edges.\n\nEach question with exactly 9 correct answers contributes 9 edges.\n\nIf there are k such questions, that's 9k edges.\n\nThe remaining (10 - k) questions can have any number of edges, but I need to ensure that every student has at least one edge.\n\nSo, the total number of edges must be at least 25.\n\nBut with k questions having exactly 9 correct answers, and the remaining (10 - k) questions having any number of correct answers, I need to maximize k while ensuring that the total number of edges is at least 25.\n\nBut the remaining (10 - k) questions can have up to 25 students each, but in practice, they should have at least 0 correct answers.\n\nWait, but every student has at least one correct answer, so the remaining questions can have any number of correct answers, including zero.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the union of all questions covers all students.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of the coverage provided by the k questions and see what remains to be covered by the remaining questions.\n\nIf the k questions cover a certain number of students, possibly with overlaps, then the remaining questions need to cover any students not yet covered.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nLet me try to calculate the minimal k.\n\nAs previously determined, k must be at least ceil(25/9) = 3.\n\nBut I need to maximize k, so I need to see how large k can be.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the maximum number of questions that can each cover 9 unique students, without exceeding the total number of students.\n\nBut if I have floor(25/9) = 2 questions, covering 18 students, but that leaves 7 students uncovered, so I need at least one more question to cover those 7 students.\n\nSo, with k = 3, I can cover all 25 students.\n\nBut I can have more questions with exactly 9 correct answers, as long as the overlaps are managed properly.\n\nFor example, with k = 4, I can have 4 questions, each covering 9 students, with overlaps such that the total number of distinct students is 25.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 5, and so on.\n\nBut is there a limit to how large k can be?\n\nWell, if I have k = 10 questions, each covering 9 students, the total number of student-question pairs is 90.\n\nBut with only 25 students, some students would be covered multiple times.\n\nBut I need to ensure that all students are covered at least once.\n\nSo, in theory, k could be up to 10, but I need to check if it's possible to arrange the students in such a way that all 10 questions have exactly 9 correct answers, and all 25 students are covered.\n\nBut perhaps there is a constraint based on the number of students and the number of questions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a maximum number of questions that can have exactly 9 correct answers.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I have k questions, each with exactly 9 students answering correctly.\n\nThe total number of student-question pairs is 9k.\n\nBut since there are only 25 students, some students must be answering correctly to multiple questions.\n\nLet\u2019s denote by r_i the number of questions that student i answered correctly.\n\nThen, the total number of student-question pairs is the sum over all students of r_i, which equals 9k.\n\nSo, sum_{i=1 to 25} r_i = 9k.\n\nMoreover, since each student answers at least one question correctly, r_i >= 1 for all i.\n\nI need to maximize k, given that sum r_i = 9k and r_i >=1 for all i.\n\nTo maximize k, I need to maximize sum r_i, which is 9k.\n\nBut sum r_i is constrained by the number of students and the fact that each student can be counted multiple times.\n\nBut in this case, sum r_i can be up to 25*10 = 250, since each student can answer up to 10 questions correctly.\n\nBut in our case, sum r_i = 9k, and k can be up to floor(250/9) = 27, but we only have 10 questions, so k <=10.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the earlier thoughts.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about the possible distributions of r_i.\n\nGiven that sum r_i = 9k and each r_i >=1, and that the number of questions is 10, I need to ensure that the sum is achievable under these constraints.\n\nMoreover, since each question has exactly 9 students who answered it correctly, the distribution of r_i must be such that exactly 9 students have r_i >=1 for each question.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the minimal sum r_i.\n\nThe minimal sum r_i is 25, when each student answers exactly one question correctly.\n\nBut in our case, sum r_i =9k.\n\nSo, 9k >=25.\n\nThus, k >= ceil(25/9) = 3.\n\nSo, k is at least 3.\n\nBut we want to maximize k, which would be up to 10, but we need to see if it's possible to have k=10.\n\nTo have k=10, sum r_i =90.\n\nWith 25 students, sum r_i =90.\n\nThis means that the average r_i is 90/25=3.6.\n\nSo, on average, each student answers correctly in 3.6 questions.\n\nBut since r_i must be integers, some students would have r_i=3, some 4, etc.\n\nBut is this possible while maintaining that each question has exactly 9 students answering correctly?\n\nThis seems plausible, but I need to check if such an arrangement is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a constraint based on the number of times each student is counted in the questions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the concept of double counting.\n\nLet me consider the total number of student-question pairs, which is 9k.\n\nThis is also equal to the sum of r_i over all students.\n\nSo, sum_{i=1 to 25} r_i =9k.\n\nMoreover, since each r_i >=1, the minimal sum is 25, which corresponds to k= ceil(25/9)=3.\n\nBut I need to maximize k, so I need to see what is the maximum k such that sum r_i =9k can be achieved with r_i >=1 for all i.\n\nGiven that sum r_i =9k and r_i >=1 for all i, and that the number of questions is 10, k can be up to 10, but I need to ensure that the distribution is possible.\n\nBut perhaps the limiting factor is the number of students.\n\nWith 25 students, and sum r_i=9k, we have 9k <=25*10=250, since each student can answer up to 10 questions correctly.\n\nBut since k<=10, 9k<=90, which is less than 250, so this isn't a constraint.\n\nSo, the only constraint is that sum r_i=9k and r_i >=1 for all i, and that the questions are such that each has exactly 9 students answering correctly.\n\nBut I need to maximize k, so perhaps k can be up to 10, but I need to ensure that all students are covered.\n\nWait, but with k=10, sum r_i=90.\n\nWith 25 students, average r_i=3.6.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nBut I need to ensure that with k=10, each question has exactly 9 students answering correctly, and that all students are covered.\n\nIs there a way to arrange this?\n\nLet me consider that with k=10, and sum r_i=90, I need to distribute the r_i such that each question has exactly 9 students with r_i >=1.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra.\n\nLet me consider the incidence matrix where rows are students and columns are questions, and entries are 1 if the student answered the question correctly, and 0 otherwise.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of columns (questions) that have exactly 9 ones.\n\nGiven that each row has at least one one, and that there are 25 rows and 10 columns.\n\nI need to maximize the number of columns with exactly 9 ones, while ensuring that each row has at least one one.\n\nThis seems like an optimization problem on the incidence matrix.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with this approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the minimal number of columns needed to cover all rows, with each column having exactly 9 ones.\n\nAs previously determined, at least ceil(25/9)=3 columns are needed.\n\nBut I want to maximize the number of such columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about how many columns with exactly 9 ones can be added before it becomes impossible to cover all rows.\n\nBut this is still unclear.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently.\n\nSuppose I fix k columns with exactly 9 ones each, and I need to ensure that all 25 rows have at least one one in their row.\n\nI need to maximize k.\n\nTo maximize k, I need to minimize the overlap between the columns, so that each new column covers as many new students as possible.\n\nSo, starting with k=1, covering 9 students.\n\nThen k=2, covering another 9 students, with possibly some overlap with the first column.\n\nTo maximize k, I need to minimize the overlap, so that each new column covers as many new students as possible.\n\nSo, with k=1, 9 students covered.\n\nWith k=2, if the second column covers 9 new students, that's 18 students covered.\n\nBut there are only 25 students, so with k=3, the third column can cover up to 9 students, but some may already be covered by the first two columns.\n\nTo maximize k, I need to arrange the columns such that each new column covers as many new students as possible.\n\nSo, with k=3, the maximum number of students covered is 27, but since there are only 25 students, there must be some overlap.\n\nSo, with k=3, it's possible to cover all 25 students.\n\nNow, can I have k=4?\n\nWith k=4, I have 36 student-question pairs.\n\nBut with 25 students, some students would be covered multiple times.\n\nI need to ensure that all students are covered at least once.\n\nThis seems possible.\n\nSimilarly, for k=5, 45 student-question pairs, which can cover 25 students with some covering multiple questions.\n\nThis also seems possible.\n\nContinuing this way, up to k=10, with 90 student-question pairs, which can easily cover 25 students with multiple coverages.\n\nSo, it seems that k can be up to 10.\n\nBut perhaps there is a constraint that prevents k from being 10.\n\nLet me think about the distribution.\n\nIf I have k=10 questions, each with exactly 9 students answering correctly, and the total number of student-question pairs is 90, then on average, each student is covered 90/25=3.6 times.\n\nBut some students may be covered more than others.\n\nBut I need to ensure that every student is covered at least once.\n\nIs there a way to arrange this?\n\nYes, it's possible.\n\nFor example, some students may be covered multiple times, but as long as all students are covered at least once, it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, k can be up to 10.\n\nBut perhaps there is a dependency between the questions.\n\nWait, but with k=10, and only 25 students, some students must be answering correctly to multiple questions.\n\nBut as long as each question has exactly 9 distinct students answering correctly, and the union covers all 25 students, it's possible.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of questions that can have been answered correctly by exactly 9 students is 10.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the maximum number of questions that can have been answered correctly by exactly 9 students.\"\n\nGiven that there are 10 questions, and we've seen that it's possible for all 10 questions to have exactly 9 students answering correctly, while covering all 25 students, then the answer should be 10.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check with smaller numbers to see if this logic holds.\n\nSuppose there are 5 students and 3 questions.\n\nEach question has exactly 2 students answering correctly.\n\nWe need to cover all 5 students.\n\nWith k=3 questions, each with 2 students, the total student-question pairs are 6.\n\nSince there are 5 students, some students are covered multiple times.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Question 1: students A and B\n\n- Question 2: students C and D\n\n- Question 3: students E and A\n\nIn this case, all 5 students are covered, and each question has exactly 2 students answering correctly.\n\nSo, k=3 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, if there were 4 questions, each with 2 students, it would still be possible to cover 5 students, with some students covered multiple times.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Question 1: A, B\n\n- Question 2: C, D\n\n- Question 3: E, A\n\n- Question 4: B, C\n\nHere, all students are covered, and each question has exactly 2 students answering correctly.\n\nSo, in this smaller example, k can be up to 4, which is more than the minimal ceil(5/2)=3.\n\nThis suggests that in the original problem, k can be up to 10.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of questions that can have been answered correctly by exactly 9 students is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
