One day, a lost child stumbled into the forest. Lumina approached, her eyes soft. \"Don't be afraid,\" she whispered, voice melodic. She led the child back to the village, her light guiding the way. From that day on, Lumina was no longer just a legend but a guardian, forever watched over by the grateful villagers."
