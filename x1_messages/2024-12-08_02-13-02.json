        "content": "Ah, you're talking about The Beatles, aren't you? They were indeed referred to as 'The Fab Four.' The self-titled album you're thinking of, often called the 'White Album' because of its plain white cover, was released in 1968, not 1971. It's officially known as The Beatles, but fans and critics alike have dubbed it the 'White Album' due to its minimalist cover design. It's a double album packed with a variety of songs that showcase the band's broad musical interests at the time. So, to answer your question, it's The Beatles' self-titled album from 1968, not 1971."
