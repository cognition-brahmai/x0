        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village with 10 houses, each having at least one cat. No two cats have the same number of kittens, and the total number of kittens is 55. We need to find the minimum number of cats in the village.\n\nFirst, since each house has at least one cat, there are at least 10 cats in the village. But we need to minimize the total number of cats, so we should try to keep the number of cats as small as possible while satisfying the conditions.\n\nThe key condition is that no two cats have the same number of kittens, and the total number of kittens is 55. To minimize the number of cats, we should maximize the number of kittens per cat. That way, fewer cats can account for the total of 55 kittens.\n\nLet's think about the maximum number of kittens a single cat can have. There's no explicit upper limit given, so theoretically, one cat could have up to 55 kittens, but that would mean only one cat in the village, which contradicts the fact that there are at least 10 cats.\n\nSo, we need to distribute the 55 kittens among the cats such that each cat has a unique number of kittens, and the number of cats is minimized.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the smallest possible number of cats. If there are exactly 10 cats, each in a separate house, and each has a distinct number of kittens, what would be the minimum and maximum number of kittens per cat?\n\nSince each cat must have at least one kitten (because if a cat has zero kittens, it wouldn't make sense in the context of \"having kittens\"), the smallest possible number of kittens for a cat is 1. Then, since no two cats can have the same number, the next cat must have at least 2 kittens, then 3, and so on.\n\nSo, if there are 10 cats with distinct numbers of kittens, the minimal total number of kittens would be the sum of the first 10 positive integers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = (10 * 11) / 2 = 55.\n\nWait a minute, that's exactly the total number of kittens we have: 55.\n\nSo, if there are 10 cats, each with a distinct number of kittens from 1 to 10, the total number of kittens is 55, which matches the given total.\n\nBut the problem states that each house has at least one cat, and there are 10 houses, so with 10 cats, each house has exactly one cat.\n\nIs it possible to have fewer than 10 cats and still have 55 kittens, with each cat having a unique number of kittens?\n\nWait, but since there are 10 houses and each house has at least one cat, the minimal number of cats is 10. So, is 10 the answer?\n\nBut let's explore if having more than one cat per house could allow for fewer total cats.\n\nWait, no. If we have more than one cat per house, the total number of cats could be more than 10, but we are trying to minimize the number of cats, so having more cats wouldn't help.\n\nWait, actually, to minimize the number of cats, we should have as few cats as possible, but the houses require at least one cat each, so the minimal number is 10 cats.\n\nBut in the earlier scenario, with 10 cats each having a distinct number of kittens from 1 to 10, the total kittens are 55, which matches the given total.\n\nSo, is the minimal number of cats 10?\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to have fewer cats by having some houses with multiple cats.\n\nWait, but if a house has multiple cats, each cat in that house must have a unique number of kittens, since no two cats have the same number of kittens.\n\nSo, if a house has two cats, they must have different numbers of kittens.\n\nBut the problem states that no two cats have the same number of kittens, so across the entire village, each cat has a unique number of kittens.\n\nSo, the numbers of kittens per cat must be distinct positive integers.\n\nGiven that, and that the total number of kittens is 55, and there are at least 10 cats, each with a distinct number of kittens.\n\nIn the minimal case, with 10 cats having 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 kittens, the total is 55, which matches the given total.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of cats is 10.\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to have fewer cats by having some cats with higher numbers of kittens.\n\nWait, but if we try to reduce the number of cats below 10, say to 9 cats, then the minimal sum of distinct positive integers for 9 cats would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9 = 45, which is less than 55.\n\nTo make the total 55 with 9 cats, we would need to increase some of the higher numbers.\n\nFor example, if we have cats with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 19 kittens, the sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+19=55.\n\nBut in this case, one cat has 19 kittens, which is acceptable since there's no upper limit.\n\nHowever, the problem states that each house has at least one cat, and there are 10 houses.\n\nIf we have only 9 cats, but there are 10 houses, one house would have no cat, which violates the condition that each house has at least one cat.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have fewer than 10 cats.\n\nHence, the minimal number of cats is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
