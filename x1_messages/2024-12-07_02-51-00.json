According to the mythology, these twin brothers were raised by a she-wolf after being abandoned as infants and went on to establish the city of Rome on the banks of the Tiber River. Romulus is said to have killed Remus in a dispute over the choice of the city's location, and thus became the first king of Rome. The Roman Empire, at its height, was one of the most powerful and influential civilizations in history, leaving a lasting legacy in law, government, engineering, art, literature, and language."
