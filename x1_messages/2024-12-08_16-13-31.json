Here's a Python script that connects to an SQLite database, creates a table called \"employees\" with columns for name, age, and job title, and inserts sample data into the table:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)\nconn = sqlite3.connect('company.db')\n\n# Create a cursor object to interact with the database\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Create the \"employees\" table\ncursor.execute('''\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (\n        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n        name TEXT NOT NULL,\n        age INTEGER NOT NULL,\n        job_title TEXT NOT NULL\n    )\n''')\n\n# Sample data to insert into the table\nsample_employees = [\n    ('John Doe', 30, 'Software Engineer'),\n    ('Jane Smith', 25, 'Data Analyst'),\n    ('Alice Johnson', 35, 'Project Manager'),\n    ('Bob Brown', 40, 'HR Manager')\n]\n\n# Insert sample data into the table\ncursor.executemany('''\n    INSERT INTO employees (name, age, job_title) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\n''', sample_employees)\n\n# Commit the changes to the database\nconn.commit()\n\n# Close the connection\nconn.close()\n```\n\nThis script does the following:\n\n1. Connects to an SQLite database file named `company.db`. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.\n2. Creates a table named \"employees\" with columns for id (auto-incremented primary key), name, age, and job title. The table is only created if it doesn't already exist.\n3. Defines a list of tuples, each representing an employee with their name, age, and job title.\n4. Inserts the sample employee data into the \"employees\" table using the `executemany` method for efficiency.\n5. Commits the changes to the database to make sure they are saved.\n6. Closes the connection to the database.\n\nYou can run this script in your Python environment to set up the database and table with the sample data."
