Each step should correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of a specific function given an input string. This string could be the user's query, a previous evidence value, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that lets users search for information via the DuckDuckGo search engine. It helps locate a range of sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from an input string (containing newline-separated links). Input is one or more links, and it outputs plain text content from these links.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and provides a plain text, newline-separated list of URLs.\nInfoQA[input]: A question-answering language model that answers queries based on an input text passage. The input should be a text-based question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput should follow this format:\nPlan: [First action based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action, based on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call with input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what was their most famous work?"
