        "content": "Let's see. So, I have this problem about a bacteria colony that doubles every 6 hours, and I need to find out how many bacteria there will be after 2 days, starting with 500 bacteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the growth pattern. Doubling every 6 hours means that the population multiplies by 2 every 6 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days would be 48 hours.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many 6-hour periods are there in 48 hours. I can do that by dividing 48 by 6, which is 8. So, there are 8 periods of 6 hours in 2 days.\n\nSince the population doubles every 6 hours, after each period, the population is multiplied by 2. So, after 8 periods, the population would be the initial population multiplied by 2 raised to the power of 8.\n\nMathematically, that would be:\n\nFinal population = Initial population \u00d7 2^number of periods\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFinal population = 500 \u00d7 2^8\n\nI know that 2^8 is 256. So,\n\nFinal population = 500 \u00d7 256\n\nNow, I just need to multiply 500 by 256.\n\n500 \u00d7 256 = 500 \u00d7 200 + 500 \u00d7 56 = 100,000 + 28,000 = 128,000\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nActually, 500 \u00d7 256:\n\n5 \u00d7 256 = 1,280\n\nSo, 500 \u00d7 256 = 128,000\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after 2 days, there will be 128,000 bacteria.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the number of 6-hour periods in 48 hours:\n\n48 \u00f7 6 = 8 periods.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the formula for exponential growth in this case is indeed initial population times 2 raised to the number of periods.\n\nSo, 500 \u00d7 2^8.\n\n2^8 is 256.\n\n500 \u00d7 256 = 128,000.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step:\n\nStart with 500 bacteria.\n\nAfter 6 hours: 500 \u00d7 2 = 1,000\n\nAfter 12 hours: 1,000 \u00d7 2 = 2,000\n\nAfter 18 hours: 2,000 \u00d7 2 = 4,000\n\nAfter 24 hours: 4,000 \u00d7 2 = 8,000\n\nAfter 30 hours: 8,000 \u00d7 2 = 16,000\n\nAfter 36 hours: 16,000 \u00d7 2 = 32,000\n\nAfter 42 hours: 32,000 \u00d7 2 = 64,000\n\nAfter 48 hours: 64,000 \u00d7 2 = 128,000\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 128,000 bacteria after 2 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{128000} \\]"
