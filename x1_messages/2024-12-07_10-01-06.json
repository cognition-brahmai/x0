        "content": "I'm trying to figure out this trivia question. It's about an Australian actress who started in a soap opera and then made it big in Hollywood. The clue is that her first name is Nicole. Hmm, there are a few actresses that come to mind, but I need to think carefully.\n\nFirst, I remember that Australia has produced many talented actors and actresses who have gone on to succeed in Hollywood. Nicole Kidman is one of them. She's Australian and has had a prolific career in Hollywood, but I'm not sure if she started in a soap opera.\n\nLet me think about Nicole Kidman's background. I know she's from Hawaii, but wait, no, her father was stationed there, but she's actually Australian. She started her career in Australia, but I don't recall if she was in a soap opera.\n\nAnother Nicole who comes to mind is Nicole Eggert, but she's American, not Australian. So that can't be the answer.\n\nWhat about Nicole Trivelli? Wait, I think she's from Australia as well. But again, I'm not sure about her starting in a soap opera.\n\nMaybe I should look into some Australian soap operas to see if any Nicoles gained popularity from there.\n\nOne famous Australian soap is \"Home and Away.\" I think a lot of actors have launched their careers from there.\n\nLet me see, was Nicole Kidman in \"Home and Away\"? I don't think so. I think she was already in Hollywood by then.\n\nAnother soap opera is \"Neighbours.\" I know many actors started there, like Eric Bana and Rachel Griffiths.\n\nBut I don't think any Nicole was in \"Neighbours.\"\n\nWait, what about \"Prisoner Cell Block H\"? That's an older Australian soap. I'm not sure if any Nicole was in that.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the actress isn't as famous as Nicole Kidman, but still successful in Hollywood.\n\nLet me consider lesser-known actresses. Maybe someone like Nicole da Silva, but I don't know if she was in a soap opera.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's someone who had a breakout role in a Hollywood movie after being in a soap opera.\n\nWait a minute, what about Margot Robbie? She's Australian, and she was in \"Neighbours\" before becoming a big Hollywood star. But her first name is Margot, not Nicole.\n\nSo that doesn't fit the clue.\n\nLet me try to think of other Nicoles from Australia.\n\nThere's Nicole Kidman, Nicole Trivelli, Nicole Fox... Hmm.\n\nNicole Fox, I think she's an Australian actress, but again, I'm not sure about her starting in a soap opera.\n\nMaybe I need to look into \"Home and Away\" cast members.\n\nI know that many actors from \"Home and Away\" have gone on to bigger things. For example, Ryan Guilherme and Mia Wasikowska.\n\nBut I don't think any of them are named Nicole.\n\nWhat about \"Silky Bevan\" from \"Home and Away\"? I think her real name is Nicole, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, Silky Bevan was played by Anja Van Der Klok, who is Dutch, not Australian.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the actress isn't from \"Home and Away.\"\n\nLet me consider other soap operas like \"Neighbors\" or \"Esso Ice Hotel.\"\n\nIn \"Neighbors,\" I know that Margot Robbie was there, but again, her name isn't Nicole.\n\nWhat about \"The Secret Life of Us\"? That's another Australian soap.\n\nI'm not sure if any Nicole was in that show.\n\nMaybe I should broaden my search to include mini-series or television dramas, not just soap operas.\n\nFor example, Nicole Kidman was in \"Bush Christmas,\" but that's not a soap opera.\n\nWait, perhaps the actress is not as well-known as Nicole Kidman.\n\nLet me think about Nicole Trivelli again. She's been in some Australian TV shows and movies, but I'm not sure about her starting in a soap opera.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's someone who had a role in a Hollywood movie after being in an Australian soap.\n\nWait, what about Naomi Watts? She's from England but moved to Australia as a child. She was in \"Party Animals\" before becoming a Hollywood star. But her first name is Naomi, not Nicole.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider actresses who have Nicole as their middle name.\n\nFor example, Sarah Nicole Prickett, but I don't know if she's Australian or if she was in a soap opera.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the clue is referring to Nicole Kidman, and I just don't know about her soap opera roots.\n\nLet me check that again. I think Nicole Kidman started her career in Australia, but I don't recall her being in a soap opera.\n\nWait, perhaps she was in \"Flowers\" or \"Capital City,\" but I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I need to do some quick research here.\n\nOkay, according to my knowledge, Nicole Kidman started her acting career at a young age in Australia, but she was in films and television shows, not necessarily soap operas.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the actress is Nicole Kidman, and the soap opera reference is incorrect.\n\nBut the clue specifically says she gained popularity through a soap opera.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an actress who is less known internationally but more known in Australia.\n\nFor example, Nicole Fox, who was in \"All Saints\" and \"Offspring.\" \"All Saints\" is a drama, not exactly a soap opera, but perhaps that counts.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, what about \"E Street\"? Wasn't there a Nicole in that show?\n\nI think Ewen Leslie was in \"E Street,\" but I don't recall any Nicole.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the answer is Nicole Kidman, even though I'm not entirely sure about her soap opera background.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an entirely different actress.\n\nWait a second, what about Nicole da Silva? She's been in various Australian TV shows and movies. I think she was in \"Stingers\" and \"Blue Heelers.\"\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if she started in a soap opera.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the definition of a soap opera. In Australia, soap operas are like \"Neighbours,\" \"Home and Away,\" \"E Street,\" etc.\n\nPerhaps the actress started in one of these before moving to Hollywood.\n\nLet me consider \"Home and Away\" again. I know that many actors have come from there to bigger roles.\n\nLooking back, was there a Nicole in \"Home and Away\"?\n\nI think there was a character named Nicole \"Nic\" Newman, played by Charlotte Behr. But I don't know if Charlotte Behr went on to have a Hollywood career.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the actress's character was named Nicole, but that might be a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not the actress's first name that is Nicole, but her character's name.\n\nBut the clue specifically says she's known as \"Nicole,\" which probably refers to her first name.\n\nThis is frustrating. I feel like I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the actress is Nicole Kidman, and the clue is referring to her early work in Australian television before she became a Hollywood star.\n\nI know that Nicole Kidman was in the miniseries \"Bush Christmas\" and other Australian productions, but I don't think those were soap operas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she was in a soap opera early in her career, and then transitioned to Hollywood.\n\nI need to verify that.\n\nUpon checking, it seems that Nicole Kidman did appear in the Australian soap opera \"Dynasty\" in 1988, but I'm not sure if that's the same as the American \"Dynasty.\"\n\nWait, there was an Australian version of \"Dynasty\" in 1988, and Nicole Kidman played Courtney Cox's character in that.\n\nSo perhaps that's where she started.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's another actress.\n\nLet me consider Nicole Trivelli again. She's been in various Australian TV shows, including \"Cop Shop\" and \"Jack Irish.\" But I don't know if she started in a soap opera.\n\nWait, what about \"Cop Shop\"? Is that a soap opera? I think it's more of a drama series.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just go with Nicole Kidman as the answer, even though I'm not entirely confident about her soap opera background.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is Nicole Kidman, and the clue is slightly incorrect about her starting in a soap opera.\n\nAfter all, she did start in Australian television, and perhaps that's what the clue is referring to.\n\nSo, to conclude, the answer is Nicole Kidman.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Nicole Kidman}} \\]"
