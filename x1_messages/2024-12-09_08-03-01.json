        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: a farmer has chickens and rabbits in a pen. There are 20 heads and 56 legs in total. I need to figure out how many chickens and how many rabbits there are.\n\nFirst, I know that both chickens and rabbits have heads, and that's probably what the 20 heads are from. So, if there are 20 heads, that means there are 20 animals in total because each animal has one head.\n\nNow, chickens have 2 legs each, and rabbits have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 56. So, I need to find out how many of these 20 animals are chickens and how many are rabbits, based on their legs.\n\nLet me try to set up some equations for this. Let's say:\n\n- Let C be the number of chickens.\n\n- Let R be the number of rabbits.\n\nFrom the heads, I know that:\n\nC + R = 20\n\nBecause there are 20 animals in total.\n\nFrom the legs, I know that:\n\n2C + 4R = 56\n\nBecause chickens have 2 legs and rabbits have 4 legs, and together they have 56 legs.\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) C + R = 20\n\n2) 2C + 4R = 56\n\nI need to solve for C and R.\n\nOne way to solve this is by substitution. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for C:\n\nC = 20 - R\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n2(20 - R) + 4R = 56\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n40 - 2R + 4R = 56\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n40 + 2R = 56\n\nNow, subtract 40 from both sides:\n\n2R = 16\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nR = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 rabbits.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for C:\n\nC = 20 - R = 20 - 8 = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 chickens and 8 rabbits.\n\nLet me double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf there are 12 chickens, that's 12 * 2 = 24 legs from chickens.\n\nIf there are 8 rabbits, that's 8 * 4 = 32 legs from rabbits.\n\nTotal legs: 24 + 32 = 56, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, 12 chickens + 8 rabbits = 20 animals, which matches the number of heads.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have solved this using elimination or other methods, but substitution works fine for this scenario.\n\nIt's interesting how setting up the equations based on the given information allows me to find the exact numbers. This is a classic example of a system of linear equations problem.\n\nI remember learning about these in algebra class. It's helpful to see how to apply them to real-world situations, even if this is a simplified scenario.\n\nAlright, I think that's the answer: 12 chickens and 8 rabbits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12 \\text{ chickens and } 8 \\text{ rabbits}} \\]"
