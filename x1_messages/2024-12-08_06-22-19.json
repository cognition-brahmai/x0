If we consider the alphabet and think about which letter represents something with a lot of water, the letter \"C\" might come to mind because it can resemble a cup, which holds water. Alternatively, \"U\" could be seen as shaped like a u-bend pipe that carries water. However, if this is a riddle, the answer is often \"the letter 'C' because it's in 'sea' and 'ocean,' which have a lot of water.\" But really, all letters are in words related to water in some way. It's a fun way to think about letters and their shapes or associations!"
