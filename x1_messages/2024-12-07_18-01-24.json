        "content": "So the store is offering a 20% discount on all items, and I have an item that originally costs $75. I need to find out how much it will cost after the discount. Let me think about how to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. I know that percentages are parts per hundred, so 20% is like 20 out of 100. In terms of the price, it means the customer saves 20% of the original price.\n\nSo, to find out how much the discount is in dollars, I can calculate 20% of $75. Once I have that amount, I can subtract it from the original price to get the final price the customer has to pay.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDiscount amount = 20% of $75\n\nFinal price = Original price - Discount amount\n\nThat makes sense. Now, how do I calculate 20% of $75?\n\nI remember that to find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply it by the number. So, 20% as a decimal is 0.20.\n\nSo, Discount amount = 0.20 \u00d7 $75\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.20 \u00d7 75 = 15\n\nSo, the discount amount is $15.\n\nNow, to find the final price:\n\nFinal price = $75 - $15 = $60\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can calculate what percentage of the original price the customer is actually paying.\n\nIf there's a 20% discount, that means the customer is paying 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\n\nSo, another way to calculate the final price is:\n\nFinal price = 80% of $75\n\nAgain, converting 80% to a decimal: 0.80\n\nSo, Final price = 0.80 \u00d7 $75\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.80 \u00d7 75 = 60\n\nSo, again, the final price is $60.\n\nIt's good that both methods give me the same answer. It confirms that $60 is the correct final price after the discount.\n\nLet me just double-check. If the original price is $75 and there's a 20% discount, taking off $15 makes sense, and paying 80% of the original price also leads to $60.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the item will cost $60 after the discount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
