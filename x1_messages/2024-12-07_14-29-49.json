        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses in total, and every third house has a red door. That means we can find the number of red doors by dividing the total number of houses by 3.\n\nSo, 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333. But since we can't have a fraction of a house, we need to round it to the nearest whole number. So, there are 33 red doors.\n\nWait a minute, but when you divide 100 by 3, you get 33 with a remainder of 1. That means 33 houses have red doors, and the remaining houses have blue doors.\n\nBut let's double-check this. If every third house has a red door, then the houses with red doors are house numbers 3, 6, 9, up to 99. So, to find out how many houses have red doors, we can find out how many multiples of 3 there are up to 100.\n\nTo find the number of multiples of 3 up to 100, we can divide 100 by 3, which is approximately 33.333, and again, we take the integer part, which is 33.\n\nSo, there are 33 houses with red doors.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if house number 100 itself has a red door. Since 100 is not a multiple of 3, it has a blue door. So, the last house with a red door is house number 99, which is 33 times 3.\n\nTherefore, the number of red doors is indeed 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]"
