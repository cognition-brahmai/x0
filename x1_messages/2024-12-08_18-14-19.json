        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. So, the formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius r is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nA = 4 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 (5 cm)\u00b2\n\nFirst, we square the radius: (5 cm)\u00b2 = 25 cm\u00b2\n\nThen, multiply by 4 and \u03c0: A = 4 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 25 cm\u00b2 = 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\nIf we approximate \u03c0 as 3.1416, then:\n\nA \u2248 100 \u00d7 3.1416 cm\u00b2 = 314.16 cm\u00b2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.16 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{314.16 \\text{ cm}^2} \\]"
