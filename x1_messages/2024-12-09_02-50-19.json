        "content": "So I have this problem here: a car travels 300 miles on a full tank of gas. Gas costs $3.50 per gallon, and the car's fuel tank holds 12 gallons. I need to find out how much it costs to travel 1,000 miles. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how far the car can go on a full tank and how much that tank costs. The car travels 300 miles on a full 12-gallon tank. So, the fuel efficiency of the car can be calculated to see how many miles per gallon it gets. That might help in finding out how much gas is needed for 1,000 miles.\n\nLet me calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). If the car travels 300 miles on 12 gallons, then:\n\nmpg = miles / gallons\n\nmpg = 300 miles / 12 gallons = 25 mpg\n\nSo, the car gets 25 miles per gallon.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many gallons of gas are needed to travel 1,000 miles. Since the car gets 25 miles per gallon, I can calculate the gallons needed by:\n\ngallons needed = total miles / mpg\n\ngallons needed = 1,000 miles / 25 mpg = 40 gallons\n\nSo, to travel 1,000 miles, the car needs 40 gallons of gas.\n\nNext, I need to find out how much that costs. Gas costs $3.50 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost would be:\n\ntotal cost = gallons needed \u00d7 cost per gallon\n\ntotal cost = 40 gallons \u00d7 $3.50/gallon = $140\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a easier way to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, since the car travels 300 miles on a full 12-gallon tank, I can find out the cost per 300 miles and then see how many such segments are in 1,000 miles.\n\nFirst, the cost of a full tank is 12 gallons \u00d7 $3.50/gallon = $42.\n\nSo, for every 300 miles, it costs $42.\n\nNow, to find out the cost for 1,000 miles, I can set up a proportion:\n\ncost / miles = $42 / 300 miles = total cost / 1,000 miles\n\nSo,\n\ntotal cost = ($42 / 300 miles) \u00d7 1,000 miles\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, $42 divided by 300 miles is $0.14 per mile.\n\nThen, $0.14 per mile times 1,000 miles is $140.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut maybe I can think about it in terms of how many full tanks are needed for 1,000 miles.\n\nSince each full tank allows 300 miles, then for 1,000 miles:\n\nnumber of tanks needed = 1,000 miles / 300 miles per tank \u2248 3.333 tanks\n\nSince you can't fill a partial tank in reality, you'd need to fill up 4 times, but that might not make sense in this context because maybe you don't fill up the tank completely every time.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, I think the proportional cost is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the cost based on the gallons needed without considering the tank capacity.\n\nEarlier, I calculated that 40 gallons are needed for 1,000 miles, and at $3.50 per gallon, that's $140.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the tank holds 12 gallons and costs $42 to fill, and 1,000 miles require 40 gallons, which is 40/12 \u2248 3.333 fill-ups.\n\nBut again, that might complicate things, and the initial method seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the cost per mile and then multiply by 1,000 miles.\n\nCost per mile is $42 / 300 miles = $0.14 per mile.\n\nThen, 1,000 miles \u00d7 $0.14/mile = $140.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, using the fuel efficiency:\n\n25 miles per gallon.\n\nSo, for 1,000 miles:\n\ngallons needed = 1,000 miles / 25 mpg = 40 gallons.\n\nCost = 40 gallons \u00d7 $3.50/gallon = $140.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the cost to travel 1,000 miles is $140.\n\nBut wait, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, does the problem mention any constraints or additional costs? For example, maybe there are taxes on gas or different pricing at different places. But based on the information given, I don't think so.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Miles and gallons are consistent in the problem, and the cost is in dollars.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the car can hold 12 gallons, but for 1,000 miles, it needs 40 gallons, which is more than the tank capacity. So, it would need to refuel multiple times. But since the cost per gallon is the same, the total cost should still be the same regardless of how many times you fill up.\n\nTherefore, the total cost remains $140.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem wanted to include the number of fill-ups, but it doesn't ask for that.\n\nSo, the answer should be $140.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
