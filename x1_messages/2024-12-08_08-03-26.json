        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we have a factory with 6 machines, and each machine produces 4 widgets per hour. The factory operates for 8 hours a day, and we want to know how many widgets are produced in 5 working days.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many widgets one machine produces in one hour. That's given as 4 widgets.\n\nNow, since there are 6 machines, the total production per hour for all machines would be 6 machines times 4 widgets per machine, which is 24 widgets per hour.\n\nNext, the factory operates for 8 hours a day. So, the daily production would be 24 widgets per hour times 8 hours, which equals 192 widgets per day.\n\nFinally, to find out the production over 5 working days, I'll multiply the daily production by 5. That's 192 widgets per day times 5 days, which equals 960 widgets.\n\nSo, the factory produces 960 widgets in 5 working days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{960} \\]"
