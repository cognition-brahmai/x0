        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three types of candies: X, Y, and Z, sold in the ratio of 4:7:9, and the total number of candies sold is 200. We need to find out how many of each type were sold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio like 4:7:9 tells us the relative amounts of each type compared to the others. So, for every 4 candies of type X, there are 7 of type Y and 9 of type Z.\n\nTo find out the actual numbers, I think I need to find a common multiple that adds up to the total candies sold, which is 200.\n\nLet me denote the number of candies of each type as multiples of a variable, say, 'k'. So, candies of type X would be 4k, type Y would be 7k, and type Z would be 9k.\n\nNow, the sum of these should equal the total candies sold:\n\n4k + 7k + 9k = 200\n\nCombining like terms, that's:\n\n20k = 200\n\nNow, to find k, I can divide both sides by 20:\n\nk = 200 / 20\n\nk = 10\n\nNow that I have k, I can find the number of each type of candy:\n\nType X: 4k = 4 * 10 = 40\n\nType Y: 7k = 7 * 10 = 70\n\nType Z: 9k = 9 * 10 = 90\n\nLet me check if these add up to 200:\n\n40 + 70 + 90 = 200\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the store sold 40 candies of type X, 70 of type Y, and 90 of type Z.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 \\text{ candies of type X},\\ 70 \\text{ candies of type Y},\\ 90 \\text{ candies of type Z}} \\]"
