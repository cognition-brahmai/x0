        "content": "So, let's tackle this savings and interest problem step by step. The person is saving $200 every month for 5 years in a savings account that offers an annual interest rate of 3%, compounded monthly. We need to find out how much interest they will earn over this period.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what \"compounded monthly\" means. When interest is compounded monthly, it means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal every month. The annual interest rate is 3%, so the monthly interest rate would be 3% divided by 12 months, which is 0.25% per month.\n\nNow, since the person is saving $200 every month, this is an example of a regular investment or a series of deposits into the account. To calculate the future value of these monthly deposits with monthly compounding interest, we can use the future value of an annuity formula. The formula for the future value of an annuity with compound interest is:\n\nFV = P \u00d7 [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r]\n\nWhere:\n\n- FV is the future value of the annuity\n\n- P is the amount of each payment (in this case, $200)\n\n- r is the interest rate per period (monthly interest rate)\n\n- n is the total number of payments\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n\nP = $200\n\nThe annual interest rate is 3%, so the monthly interest rate, r, is 3% / 12 = 0.25% = 0.0025 (as a decimal)\n\nThe number of months in 5 years is 5 \u00d7 12 = 60 months, so n = 60\n\nNow, let's calculate the future value (FV):\n\nFV = 200 \u00d7 [( (1 + 0.0025)^60 - 1 ) / 0.0025 ]\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.0025)^60:\n\n1 + 0.0025 = 1.0025\n\n1.0025^60 is approximately 1.161616 (using a calculator)\n\nNow, subtract 1:\n\n1.161616 - 1 = 0.161616\n\nThen, divide by 0.0025:\n\n0.161616 / 0.0025 = 64.6464\n\nFinally, multiply by 200:\n\n200 \u00d7 64.6464 = 12,929.28\n\nSo, the future value of the annuity after 5 years is approximately $12,929.28\n\nBut, the question asks for the interest earned, not the total amount. To find the interest earned, we need to subtract the total amount deposited from the future value.\n\nTotal amount deposited = monthly deposit \u00d7 number of months = 200 \u00d7 60 = $12,000\n\nInterest earned = future value - total deposits = 12,929.28 - 12,000 = $929.28\n\nTherefore, the interest earned over 5 years is approximately $929.28\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the monthly interest rate is indeed 3% / 12 = 0.25% or 0.0025.\n\nNumber of months is 5 years \u00d7 12 = 60 months.\n\nThe formula I used is correct for the future value of an annuity with compound interest.\n\nCalculating (1 + 0.0025)^60:\n\n1.0025^60 is approximately 1.161616, which seems right.\n\nThen, (1.161616 - 1) / 0.0025 = 0.161616 / 0.0025 = 64.6464\n\nThen, 200 \u00d7 64.6464 = 12,929.28\n\nTotal deposits are 200 \u00d7 60 = 12,000\n\nInterest earned is 12,929.28 - 12,000 = 929.28\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:\n\nFV = P \u00d7 [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r]\n\nWhich is what I used.\n\nAlternatively, some people might use the formula for the future value of an annuity due, where payments are made at the beginning of the period, but since the problem doesn't specify, and typically savings deposits are made at the end of the period, we'll stick with the ordinary annuity formula.\n\nAnother way to check is to use the formula for the future value of a series of payments with compound interest.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Excel FV function:\n\nFV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])\n\nIn this case:\n\nRate = 0.0025\n\nNper = 60\n\nPmt = -200 (negative because it's an outflow)\n\nPv = 0 (no initial deposit)\n\nType = 0 (end of period)\n\nPlugging into Excel: =FV(0.0025,60,-200,0,0) gives $12,929.28, which matches our calculation.\n\nSo, the future value is indeed $12,929.28, and the interest earned is $929.28.\n\nTherefore, the interest earned over 5 years is approximately $929.28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{929.28} \\]"
