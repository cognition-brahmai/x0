Not for the weak stomached, it isn't. But if you really wants to know, we'll tell you, we will.\n\nFirst off, you needs some meat, yes, meat. Not just any meat, no, precious, the finest, the choicest. Maybe a tender young Hobbit, if you can get one, but they're slippery, they are. Or perhaps a plump rabbit, that'll do, yes. Clean it good, you must, scrub it till it shines, yes.\n\nThen, you needs some herbs, yes, herbs. Not the stinky ones, no, the sweet ones. Maybe some mint, some parsley, yes. Chop them fine, like you's gonna make a salad, but don't make a salad, no. Save them for later.\n\nNow, take a big pot, the biggest one you can find. Fill it with water, yes, lots of water. Put it on the fire, yes, get it boiling. While it's heating up, you can be preparing the meat.\n\nTake the meat, wash it again, just to be sure. Then, you needs to season it. Salt, pepper, yes, but also some special spices. Cumin, maybe, and coriander. A pinch of this, a pinch of that. Don't ask us how much, just use your nose, yes.\n\nNow, when the water's boiling, carefully lower the meat into the pot. It'll splash, so be careful, yes. Let it simmer, yes, simmer away. Don't let it boil too hard, or it'll make the meat tough.\n\nWhile it's simmering, you can be preparing some vegetables. Carrots, onions, maybe a potato or two. Chop them up, not too small, no, leave them in chunks. When the meat's been simmering for a while, add them to the pot.\n\nNow, here's the tricky part. You needs to let it cook slow, very slow. All day if you can, yes. The longer it cooks, the tender the meat gets. But you mustn't let the water boil away, no. Keep adding more water as it evaporates.\n\nTowards the end, when the meat's falling apart, add those herbs you chopped earlier. Let them steep in the broth for a bit, then it's ready.\n\nServe it in big bowls, with lots of broth. Eat it with chunks of bread, to dip in the broth. Yum, yum, it's delicious, it is.\n\nBut remember, precious, it's our secret recipe. Don't tell anyone else about it, no. It's our favorite dish, and we don't want everyone copying it.\n\nYes, yes, that's the recipe for our favorite dish. Now, go on, eat up, precious."
