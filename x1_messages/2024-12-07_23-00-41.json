        "content": "So the company is seeing a 10% increase in sales each month, and they sold 100 units in the first month. We need to find out how many units they'll sell in the sixth month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 10% increase means. If they sold 100 units in the first month, a 10% increase would be 10 units, so in the second month, they'd sell 110 units. Then, in the third month, they'd have another 10% increase on 110 units, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a pattern where each month's sales are 10% more than the previous month's sales. So, it's a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by a common ratio.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, the nth term can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[a_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(a_n\\) is the nth term,\n\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the common ratio,\n\n- \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\(a_1 = 100\\) units,\n\n- \\(r = 1.10\\) (since a 10% increase means multiplying by 1.10),\n\n- \\(n = 6\\) (since we're looking for the sixth month).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[a_6 = 100 \\times 1.10^{(6-1)} = 100 \\times 1.10^5\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(1.10^5\\). Let's see:\n\n\\[1.10^1 = 1.10\\]\\[1.10^2 = 1.21\\]\\[1.10^3 = 1.331\\]\\[1.10^4 = 1.4641\\]\\[1.10^5 = 1.61051\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[a_6 = 100 \\times 1.61051 = 161.051\\]\n\nSince we're dealing with units sold, which should be a whole number, we can round this to 161 units.\n\nWait a minute, but in real life, you can't sell a fraction of a unit, so rounding makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for compound interest, since it's a similar concept of something increasing by a percentage each period.\n\nThe compound interest formula is:\n\n\\[A = P(1 + r)^n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(A\\) is the amount after n periods,\n\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount (initial amount),\n\n- \\(r\\) is the rate of increase per period,\n\n- \\(n\\) is the number of periods.\n\nThis looks very similar to the geometric sequence formula. In fact, it's essentially the same thing.\n\nUsing this formula:\n\n\\[A = 100 \\times (1 + 0.10)^5 = 100 \\times 1.10^5\\]\n\nWhich again gives us \\(A = 100 \\times 1.61051 = 161.051\\), or approximately 161 units.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nBut let's double-check by calculating the sales for each month step by step.\n\nMonth 1: 100 units\n\nMonth 2: 100 + 0.10*100 = 110 units\n\nMonth 3: 110 + 0.10*110 = 121 units\n\nMonth 4: 121 + 0.10*121 = 133.1 units\n\nMonth 5: 133.1 + 0.10*133.1 = 146.41 units\n\nMonth 6: 146.41 + 0.10*146.41 = 161.051 units\n\nAgain, rounding to the nearest whole number gives us 161 units.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the increases are compounded, maybe we should use the compound interest formula directly, but as we've seen, it's essentially the same as the geometric sequence formula.\n\nI think the answer is definitely 161 units.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, especially in business, they might consider the increase based on the original amount rather than on the cumulative amount. Is that possible?\n\nLet me think about that. If the increase is based on the original amount, then each month they'd add 10% of the first month's sales, which is 10 units each month.\n\nSo, in that case:\n\nMonth 1: 100 units\n\nMonth 2: 100 + 10 = 110 units\n\nMonth 3: 110 + 10 = 120 units\n\nMonth 4: 120 + 10 = 130 units\n\nMonth 5: 130 + 10 = 140 units\n\nMonth 6: 140 + 10 = 150 units\n\nBut this seems contradictory to the initial interpretation where the increase is on the previous month's sales.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"sales have been increasing by 10% each month.\"\n\nThis typically means that each month's sales are 10% higher than the previous month's sales, which is the first interpretation I had, leading to 161 units in the sixth month.\n\nThe second interpretation, where the increase is a fixed 10% of the first month's sales each month, seems less likely, unless specified otherwise.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 161 units in the sixth month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{161} \\]"
