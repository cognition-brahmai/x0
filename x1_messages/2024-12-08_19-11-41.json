        "content": "So, in this city, 40% of the population uses public transportation, and the total population is 1,200,000 people. I need to find out how many people do not use public transportation.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many people actually use public transportation. Since 40% use it, I can calculate that by taking 40% of 1,200,000.\n\nTo calculate 40% of 1,200,000, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 40% is the same as 0.40.\n\nSo, 0.40 times 1,200,000 equals... let's see, 0.4 times 1,200,000.\n\nWell, 0.4 times 1,000,000 is 400,000, and 0.4 times 200,000 is 80,000. So, 400,000 plus 80,000 equals 480,000.\n\nSo, 480,000 people use public transportation.\n\nNow, to find out how many do not use it, I subtract the number of people who use it from the total population.\n\nSo, 1,200,000 minus 480,000 equals... that would be 720,000.\n\nTherefore, 720,000 people do not use public transportation.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of people who do not use public transportation directly.\n\nIf 40% use public transportation, then the remaining percentage does not use it. So, 100% minus 40% equals 60%.\n\nSo, 60% of the population does not use public transportation.\n\nNow, to find 60% of 1,200,000.\n\nAgain, converting 60% to a decimal gives 0.60.\n\nSo, 0.60 times 1,200,000.\n\nSimilarly, 0.6 times 1,000,000 is 600,000, and 0.6 times 200,000 is 120,000.\n\nAdding those up, 600,000 plus 120,000 equals 720,000.\n\nSo, again, I get 720,000 people who do not use public transportation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use fractions.\n\n40% is equivalent to 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nSo, 2/5 of the population uses public transportation.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who use it is 2/5 times 1,200,000.\n\n2/5 times 1,200,000.\n\nFirst, 1,200,000 divided by 5 is 240,000.\n\nThen, 240,000 multiplied by 2 is 480,000.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nNow, for those who do not use public transportation, it's 3/5, since 1 minus 2/5 is 3/5.\n\nSo, 3/5 times 1,200,000.\n\n1,200,000 divided by 5 is 240,000.\n\n240,000 multiplied by 3 is 720,000.\n\nOnce more, 720,000.\n\nI think I'm consistent here.\n\nAnother way could be to use proportions.\n\nIf 40% use public transportation, then for every 100 people, 40 use it, and 60 do not.\n\nSo, in a population of 1,200,000, how many groups of 100 are there?\n\n1,200,000 divided by 100 equals 12,000 groups.\n\nEach group has 60 people who do not use public transportation.\n\nSo, 12,000 groups times 60 people per group equals 720,000.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the number of people who do not use public transportation is 720,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{720000} \\]"
