        "content": "So the factory produces 400 cars each month, and I need to find out how many cars it produces in a decade. A decade is 10 years, right? Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many months there are in a year. I know there are 12 months in a year. So, if the factory produces 400 cars each month, then in one year, it would produce 400 cars/month times 12 months/year. That would be 400 * 12 = 4,800 cars per year.\n\nNow, since a decade is 10 years, I need to find out how many cars are produced in 10 years. So, I'll take the annual production, which is 4,800 cars, and multiply it by 10 years. That should give me 4,800 * 10 = 48,000 cars in a decade.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Another way could be to calculate the total number of months in a decade first. Since there are 12 months in a year and 10 years in a decade, the total number of months in a decade would be 12 * 10 = 120 months.\n\nThen, if the factory produces 400 cars each month, the total production in a decade would be 400 cars/month * 120 months = 48,000 cars.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the factory produces 48,000 cars in a decade.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48000} \\]"
