        "content": "So the restaurant serves lunch to an average of 150 customers per day, and each customer spends an average of $12 on their meal. It operates 6 days a week. We need to find out its weekly lunch revenue.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out how much revenue the restaurant makes in one day. Since each customer spends $12 and there are 150 customers per day, I can multiply these two numbers to get the daily revenue.\n\nSo, daily revenue = number of customers per day \u00d7 average spending per customer\n\nThat would be:\n\nDaily revenue = 150 customers/day \u00d7 $12/customer = $1,800/day\n\nNow, the restaurant operates 6 days a week, so to find the weekly revenue, I need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of operating days in a week.\n\nWeekly revenue = daily revenue \u00d7 number of operating days per week\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nWeekly revenue = $1,800/day \u00d7 6 days/week = $10,800/week\n\nWait a minute, does that seem right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 150 customers per day each spending $12:\n\n150 \u00d7 12 = 1,800 per day\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, operating 6 days a week:\n\n1,800 \u00d7 6 = 10,800 per week\n\nThat seems correct too. But maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the revenue, like taxes or discounts, but the question doesn't mention any of that. So, I think $10,800 is the correct weekly lunch revenue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently to confirm. For example, calculate the total number of customers in a week and then multiply by the average spending per customer.\n\nTotal customers per week = number of customers per day \u00d7 number of operating days per week\n\nTotal customers per week = 150 customers/day \u00d7 6 days/week = 900 customers/week\n\nThen, weekly revenue = total customers per week \u00d7 average spending per customer\n\nWeekly revenue = 900 customers/week \u00d7 $12/customer = $10,800/week\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, I'm confident that the weekly lunch revenue is $10,800.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10800} \\]"
