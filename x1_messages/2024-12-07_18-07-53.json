Assuming that the 'employees' table has columns named 'department', 'salary', and 'years_of_experience', the query would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    department,\n    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,\n    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,\n    MAX(years_of_experience) AS max_years_of_experience\nFROM \n    employees\nGROUP BY \n    department;\n```\n\nThis query will provide you with the total number of employees, the average salary, and the maximum years of experience for each department in the 'employees' table."
