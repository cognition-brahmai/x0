        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses in the village, and each house has 2 doors. So, first, I need to find out the total number of doors in the village. Since each house has 2 doors, I can multiply the number of houses by the number of doors per house:\n\n10 houses * 2 doors/house = 20 doors\n\nSo, there are 20 doors in total.\n\nNow, the problem says that half of the doors were painted red, and the other half were painted blue. So, to find out how many red doors there are, I need to find half of the total number of doors.\n\nHalf of 20 doors is:\n\n20 doors / 2 = 10 doors\n\nTherefore, there are 10 red doors in the village.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? The problem seems straightforward. There are 10 houses, each with 2 doors, making a total of 20 doors. Half of them are red, and half are blue. So, 10 red doors and 10 blue doors.\n\nI think that's it. The answer should be 10 red doors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
