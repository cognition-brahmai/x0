        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car that travels from Point X to Point Y at 60 miles per hour, and then back from Y to X at 40 miles per hour. We need to find the average speed for the entire round trip.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Point X and Point Y is D miles. That means the total distance for the round trip is 2D miles.\n\nNow, for the trip from X to Y at 60 mph, the time taken would be distance divided by speed, so D / 60 hours.\n\nFor the return trip from Y to X at 40 mph, the time taken would be D / 40 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is D/60 + D/40 hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120, I think.\n\nSo, D/60 = (2D)/120, and D/40 = (3D)/120.\n\nAdding them up: (2D + 3D)/120 = 5D/120 = D/24 hours.\n\nNow, total distance is 2D miles, and total time is D/24 hours.\n\nSo, average speed = total distance / total time = 2D / (D/24) = 2D * (24/D) = 48 mph.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But I've heard somewhere that average speed isn't just the average of the two speeds. Is there something I'm missing here?\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I take the average of 60 and 40, which is 50 mph. But that can't be right because the times are different for each leg of the trip. Yeah, that doesn't seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the harmonic mean, since we're dealing with speeds and times.\n\nThe harmonic mean of two speeds is given by 2AB / (A + B), where A and B are the speeds.\n\nSo, plugging in A = 60 and B = 40:\n\n(2 * 60 * 40) / (60 + 40) = (4800) / (100) = 48 mph.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed is 48 mph.\n\nBut why is this the case? Well, because the time spent on each leg of the trip is different due to the different speeds. So, the average speed isn't simply the arithmetic mean of the two speeds.\n\nLet me check with actual numbers to confirm.\n\nSuppose the distance D between X and Y is 120 miles (I'll choose 120 because it's a common multiple of 60 and 40, making calculations easier).\n\nFrom X to Y at 60 mph:\n\nTime = 120 / 60 = 2 hours.\n\nFrom Y to X at 40 mph:\n\nTime = 120 / 40 = 3 hours.\n\nTotal distance = 240 miles.\n\nTotal time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed = 240 / 5 = 48 mph.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nSo, the car's average speed for the entire round trip is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
