        "content": "So, I have this problem here about a factory's production and I need to find out the utilization rate. Let me see what I've got.\n\nFirst, the factory produces 100 units per day, and each unit takes 5 minutes to produce. Also, the factory operates for 10 hours a day. I need to find the utilization rate based on this information.\n\nOkay, so utilization rate generally refers to how much of the available production time is actually used for producing items. It's a measure of how efficiently the factory is using its operating time.\n\nSo, to calculate the utilization rate, I probably need to find out the total time spent on producing the units and then divide that by the total available operating time.\n\nLet me first calculate the total time spent on producing 100 units. Each unit takes 5 minutes, so 100 units would take 100 times 5 minutes.\n\n100 units * 5 minutes/unit = 500 minutes.\n\nNow, the factory operates for 10 hours a day. I need to convert this operating time into minutes because my production time is in minutes.\n\n10 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 600 minutes.\n\nSo, the total available operating time is 600 minutes, and the time actually used for production is 500 minutes.\n\nNow, the utilization rate should be the production time divided by the total available operating time, expressed as a percentage.\n\nUtilization rate = (production time / total available time) * 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nUtilization rate = (500 minutes / 600 minutes) * 100% = (5/6) * 100% \u2248 83.33%\n\nSo, the utilization rate of the factory is approximately 83.33%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 100 units * 5 minutes/unit = 500 minutes. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 10 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 600 minutes. That's also correct.\n\nAnd 500 divided by 600 is indeed 5/6, which is approximately 83.33%. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe I should consider if there are any breaks or downtime in the operating hours, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume that the entire 10 hours are available for production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production time per unit includes some overhead times, but again, the problem states that each unit takes 5 minutes to produce, so I think it's safe to use that figure directly.\n\nSo, I think 83.33% is the correct utilization rate for the factory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{83.33\\%} \\]"
