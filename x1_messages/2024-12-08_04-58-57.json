        "content": "So I have this problem here: calculate the sum of the first 50 terms of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3 and a first term of 2. Okay, let's see. I remember there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, but I need to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, what's an arithmetic sequence? It's a sequence where each term is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. In this case, the common difference is 3, and the first term is 2. So, the sequence starts like 2, 5, 8, 11, and so on, up to the 50th term.\n\nNow, the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nwhere:\n\n- S_n is the sum of the first n terms\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\nSo, I need to find S_50, which is the sum of the first 50 terms. I know n is 50, a_1 is 2, and I need to find a_50.\n\nHow do I find the 50th term of an arithmetic sequence? There's another formula for that:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nwhere:\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- n is the term number\n\n- d is the common difference\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\na_50 = 2 + (50 - 1) * 3\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n50 - 1 = 49\n\n49 * 3 = 147\n\nSo, a_50 = 2 + 147 = 149\n\nNow that I have a_50, I can plug it back into the sum formula:\n\nS_50 = 50/2 * (2 + 149)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses first:\n\n2 + 149 = 151\n\nThen, 50/2 is 25\n\nSo, S_50 = 25 * 151\n\nNow, let's multiply that:\n\n25 * 151\n\nWell, 25 * 100 = 2500\n\n25 * 50 = 1250\n\n25 * 1 = 25\n\nAdding those up: 2500 + 1250 = 3750, plus 25 is 3775\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first 50 terms is 3775.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nI recall there's another formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nS_n = n * a_1 + n*(n-1)/2 * d\n\nLet's see if that gives me the same answer.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS_50 = 50 * 2 + 50*49/2 * 3\n\nFirst, 50 * 2 = 100\n\nThen, 50*49 = 2450\n\nDivide that by 2: 2450/2 = 1225\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 1225 * 3 = 3675\n\nNow, add that to the 100:\n\n100 + 3675 = 3775\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (2*a_1 + (n - 1)*d)\n\nLet's try that.\n\nS_50 = 50/2 * (2*2 + (50 - 1)*3)\n\nSimplify step by step:\n\n50/2 = 25\n\n2*2 = 4\n\n50 - 1 = 49\n\n49*3 = 147\n\nSo, 25 * (4 + 147) = 25 * 151 = 3775\n\nAgain, the same answer. Seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can calculate the sum of the first few terms manually and see if it matches.\n\nFor example, the first term is 2.\n\nSecond term is 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nThird term is 5 + 3 = 8.\n\nFourth term is 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nSo, sum of first four terms: 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 = 26.\n\nUsing the formula, S_4 = 4/2 * (2 + 14) = 2 * 16 = 32. Wait, that's not right.\n\nWait, a_4 = 2 + (4-1)*3 = 2 + 9 = 11, which matches.\n\nSo, S_4 = 4/2 * (2 + 11) = 2 * 13 = 26, which matches my manual calculation.\n\nOkay, good, the formula works.\n\nI think I've confirmed enough that the sum of the first 50 terms is indeed 3775.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3775} \\]"
