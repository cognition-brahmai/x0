        "content": "So, the train is going at an average speed of 50 miles per hour and it takes 4 hours to get to where it's going. I need to find out how far away the destination is.\n\nI remember that when we talk about speed, time, and distance, there's a formula that connects them. It's usually distance equals speed multiplied by time, right? So, if speed is 50 mph and time is 4 hours, then distance should be 50 times 4.\n\nLet me calculate that. 50 multiplied by 4 is 200. So, the destination is 200 miles away.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that the units match. Speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, so when I multiply them, I get miles, which is correct for distance.\n\nAlso, the question says \"average speed,\" which means that the train might have gone faster or slower at different points during the journey, but overall, it averaged out to 50 mph. So, even if it sped up or slowed down at times, the total distance should still be 200 miles if it maintained an average speed of 50 mph over 4 hours.\n\nI think that makes sense. Is there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using more advanced physics or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. This seems like a straightforward problem using the basic formula for distance.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider that if the train was going at a constant speed of 50 mph for 4 hours, it would indeed cover 200 miles. Since it's an average speed, there might be variations, but the total distance remains the same.\n\nSo, my final answer is that the destination is 200 miles away.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
