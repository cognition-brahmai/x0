        "content": "Guinness World Records, originally called Guinness Book of Records, is a reference book published annually that documents world records and national records, including those of human achievements, naturally occurring phenomena, and types of entertainment, such as films, video games, and television. The book was inspired by Sir Hugh Beaver, the managing director of the Guinness Brewery, who, in 1951, had an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe while eating at a shooting party in Ireland. Unable to find an answer in existing record books, Beaver thought that a book listing all the world's superlatives would be a great idea.\n\nBeaver discussed his idea with his friend,ere was no definitive reference to turn to for such information. He thought that a book listing all the world's extremes and records would be a great idea. He shared this idea with his friend, Ernests Hill, who was a zoologist and a gamekeeper. Hill agreed and started compiling a list of records.\n\nIn 1954, Beaver approached the twin brothers Norris and Ross McWhirter, who were known for their encyclopedic knowledge, to compile the book. The first edition, called \"The Guinness Book of Records,\" was published on August 27, 1955, and immediately became a bestseller. The book's popularity grew rapidly, and it was soon published in multiple languages and countries.\n\nOver the years, Guinness World Records has documented a vast array of records, ranging from the bizarre to the extraordinary. Some notable records include the tallest person, the oldest person, the longest fingernails, the fastest marathon time, the highest-altitude basketball game, and the most people doing the Macarena simultaneously.\n\nThe process for verifying and awarding new records is rigorous and thorough to ensure accuracy and fairness. Here's a general overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. **Research and Verification:** Before a record can be recognized, Guinness World Records researchers thoroughly check all existing records to confirm that the proposed record is indeed unique and hasn't been surpassed already.\n\n2. **Application:** Individuals or groups who believe they can break a record must first apply to Guinness World Records through their official website. They need to provide detailed information about their attempt, including plans, safety measures, and any necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Record Rules and Guidelines:** Each record has specific rules and guidelines that must be followed. These rules are designed to maintain consistency and fairness across all attempts. Applicants must adhere to these rules strictly.\n\n4. **Verification Process:** For many records, especially those that are complex or require precise measurement, Guinness World Records may send official adjudicators to witness and verify the attempt. These adjudicators are experts in their fields and ensure that all rules are followed and that the attempt is genuine.\n\n5. **Evidence Submission:** In some cases, especially for records that don't require physical presence, applicants may need to submit evidence such as photographs, videos, or official documents to support their claim.\n\n6. **Review and Approval:** Once the attempt is completed and evidence is submitted, it undergoes a review process by Guinness World Records' team. This may involve further verification and cross-checking of data.\n\n7. **Announcement:** If the attempt is successful and meets all the required standards, Guinness World Records will officially recognize the new record and may feature it in their publications or on their website.\n\n8. **Maintenance of Records:** Guinness World Records continuously monitors and updates records to reflect the latest achievements. Records can be broken at any time, and the process starts anew with each new attempt.\n\nGuinness World Records has become a global phenomenon, inspiring people of all ages to push their limits and achieve extraordinary feats. The organization plays a crucial role in validating and celebrating human achievements and extraordinary events from around the world."
