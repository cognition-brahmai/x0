        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field with a length of 120 meters and a width of 80 meters. The farmer wants to plant trees along the perimeter of the field, and each tree should be exactly 10 meters apart from its neighbors. We need to find out how many trees he will need.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the perimeter of the rectangular field. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:\n\n\\[P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[P = 2 \\times (120 + 80) = 2 \\times 200 = 400 \\text{ meters}\\]\n\nSo, the total perimeter is 400 meters.\n\nNow, if trees are to be planted 10 meters apart, we might initially think to divide the perimeter by the distance between trees:\n\n\\[\\text{Number of trees} = \\frac{P}{\\text{distance between trees}} = \\frac{400}{10} = 40\\]\n\nBut wait, let's consider whether this is entirely accurate. When planting trees along a closed path, like the perimeter of a field, the first tree and the last tree will coincide if we simply divide the perimeter by the distance between trees. This is because the path ends where it starts, forming a loop.\n\nHowever, in practice, when planting trees along a closed loop, the number of trees is equal to the perimeter divided by the distance between them, because the first and last tree are the same.\n\nBut let's verify this with a smaller example to be sure. Suppose we have a square with sides of 10 meters, so the perimeter is 40 meters, and we want to plant trees every 10 meters.\n\nIf we calculate \\(\\frac{40}{10} = 4\\) trees, that makes sense: one tree at each corner of the square.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, with a perimeter of 400 meters and trees every 10 meters, dividing 400 by 10 gives us 40 trees.\n\nHowever, to make sure, let's consider the arrangement along each side of the rectangle.\n\nStarting with the length side (120 meters), if trees are planted every 10 meters, the number of trees along one length would be:\n\n\\[\\frac{120}{10} + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\\]\n\nWe add one because we need to count the tree at the starting point.\n\nSimilarly, for the width side (80 meters):\n\n\\[\\frac{80}{10} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\\]\n\nNow, for the entire rectangle, we have two lengths and two widths. So, total trees would be:\n\n\\[2 \\times 13 + 2 \\times 9 = 26 + 18 = 44\\]\n\nBut wait, this counts the corner trees twice, once for each adjacent side. Since the corners are shared, we need to subtract the four corner trees that were double-counted:\n\n\\[44 - 4 = 40\\]\n\nAh, this matches our earlier calculation of 40 trees.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the perimeter as a continuous loop, the number of trees is indeed the perimeter divided by the distance between them, which is 400 / 10 = 40.\n\nTherefore, the farmer will need 40 trees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
