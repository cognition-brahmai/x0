        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. Initially, there are four boxes, and each box contains 20 marbles. So, the total number of marbles at the start is:\n\n4 boxes * 20 marbles per box = 80 marbles\n\nNow, you take away two boxes. Since each box has 20 marbles, taking away two boxes means you're removing:\n\n2 boxes * 20 marbles per box = 40 marbles\n\nSo, after taking away two boxes, the number of marbles you have left is:\n\n80 marbles - 40 marbles = 40 marbles\n\nNext, you add three more boxes, each containing 20 marbles. So, you're adding:\n\n3 boxes * 20 marbles per box = 60 marbles\n\nNow, to find the total number of marbles you have now, you add the marbles you had left after taking away two boxes to the marbles you added:\n\n40 marbles + 60 marbles = 100 marbles\n\nTherefore, you now have 100 marbles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Initially, there are four boxes with 20 marbles each, totaling 80 marbles. You take away two boxes, which are 40 marbles, leaving you with 40 marbles. Then you add three boxes, each with 20 marbles, adding 60 marbles, bringing the total to 100 marbles. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, you could think about the number of boxes you have at the end. You start with four boxes, take away two, leaving two boxes, then add three more boxes, ending up with five boxes. Since each box has 20 marbles, five boxes would have:\n\n5 boxes * 20 marbles per box = 100 marbles\n\nThis matches the previous calculation, so I'm confident that 100 marbles is the correct total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
