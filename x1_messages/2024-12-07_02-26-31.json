        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In a group of people, 40% are wearing glasses, 60% are wearing hats, and 20% are wearing both glasses and hats. I need to find out what percentage of the group is not wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nOkay, so first, I should probably visualize this somehow. I think a Venn diagram would be useful here. Let's imagine two circles overlapping: one for glasses and one for hats.\n\nThe glasses circle has 40% of the group, and the hats circle has 60%. The overlapping area, where people are wearing both glasses and hats, is 20%.\n\nSo, to find the percentage wearing either glasses or hats or both, I should add the percentages of those wearing glasses and those wearing hats, and then subtract the overlap because those people are counted in both circles.\n\nThat is:\n\nPercentage wearing glasses or hats = (Percentage wearing glasses) + (Percentage wearing hats) - (Percentage wearing both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 40% + 60% - 20% = 80%\n\nSo, 80% of the group is wearing either glasses or hats or both.\n\nNow, to find the percentage not wearing either, I think I need to subtract that 80% from 100%, since 100% represents the whole group.\n\nSo:\n\nPercentage not wearing either = 100% - (Percentage wearing glasses or hats)\n\n= 100% - 80% = 20%\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the principles of set theory. If we have two sets, A and B, the formula for the union of A and B is:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number (or percentage) in set A (glasses)\n\n- n(B) is the number (or percentage) in set B (hats)\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number (or percentage) in both sets\n\nSo, applying this:\n\nn(glasses \u222a hats) = 40% + 60% - 20% = 80%\n\nAnd the complement of that would be the percentage not wearing either, which is indeed 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the individual probabilities or percentages.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- G = wearing glasses\n\n- H = wearing hats\n\nWe are given:\n\n- P(G) = 40%\n\n- P(H) = 60%\n\n- P(G and H) = 20%\n\nWe need to find P(not G and not H), which is the same as 1 - P(G or H).\n\nWe already calculated P(G or H) = P(G) + P(H) - P(G and H) = 40% + 60% - 20% = 80%.\n\nTherefore, P(not G and not H) = 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We include the percentages of glasses and hats, then exclude the overlap.\n\nSo, again, we get 40% + 60% - 20% = 80%, and subtracting from 100% gives 20%.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can verify this with actual numbers. Suppose the group has 100 people (since percentages are out of 100, this simplifies calculations).\n\n- 40 people wear glasses\n\n- 60 people wear hats\n\n- 20 people wear both\n\nSo, the number wearing only glasses is 40 - 20 = 20 people.\n\nThe number wearing only hats is 60 - 20 = 40 people.\n\nThe number wearing both is 20 people.\n\nSo, the total wearing either glasses or hats or both is 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 people.\n\nTherefore, the number not wearing either is 100 - 80 = 20 people, which is 20%.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a contingency table to organize the information.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\n```\n\n          Wear Hats   Not Wear Hats   Total\n\nWear Glasses    20%           20% - 20% = 20%    40%\n\nDon't Wear Glasses 60% - 20% = 40%        ?       60%\n\nTotal           60%           40%         100%\n\n```\n\nWait, let's adjust that.\n\nIf 20% wear both glasses and hats, and 40% wear glasses in total, then the number wearing only glasses is 40% - 20% = 20%.\n\nSimilarly, the number wearing only hats is 60% - 20% = 40%.\n\nThen, the number wearing neither should be 100% - (20% + 40% + 20%) = 20%, which again confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother angle: using probabilities, we can consider the probability of not wearing glasses and not wearing hats.\n\nWe know that:\n\nP(not G and not H) = 1 - P(G or H)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nP(not G and not H) = 1 - [P(G) + P(H) - P(G and H)]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n= 1 - [40% + 60% - 20%]\n\n= 1 - 80% = 20%\n\nSo, all these methods lead me to the same conclusion that 20% of the group is not wearing either glasses or hats.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this to ensure I'm not missing something?\n\nPerhaps considering the conditional probabilities, but that might be unnecessary for this problem.\n\nFor example, the probability of wearing hats given wearing glasses is P(H|G) = P(G and H)/P(G) = 20%/40% = 50%.\n\nBut I don't think that helps directly with this particular question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of independent events, but again, it's not necessary here because the inclusion-exclusion principle works perfectly.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The answer should be 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
