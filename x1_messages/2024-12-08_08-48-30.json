        "content": "So there are 5 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nHmm, let's see. If there are 5 people, then the first person shakes hands with 4 other people, right? Because they don't shake their own hand.\n\nThen, the second person has already shaken hands with the first person, so they only need to shake hands with the remaining 3 people.\n\nSimilarly, the third person has already shaken hands with the first two, so they only shake hands with the remaining 2 people.\n\nThe fourth person has shaken hands with the first three, so they only need to shake hands with the last person.\n\nAnd the fifth person has already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, if I add up all those handshakes: 4 (from the first person) + 3 (from the second) + 2 (from the third) + 1 (from the fourth) + 0 (from the fifth) that gives me 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 10 handshakes in total.\n\nWait, is there a better way to calculate this without adding them one by one? I think there is a formula for this kind of thing, something to do with combinations.\n\nYes, because shaking hands is a combination of 2 people out of 5, and the order doesn't matter. So, the number of handshakes should be the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 5.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 and k = 2, so C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (120) / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.\n\nSo, again, that gives me 10 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure I'm not missing anything. Suppose I have 5 people: A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nLet's list all possible handshakes:\n\nA shakes hands with B, C, D, E.\n\nB shakes hands with C, D, E.\n\nC shakes hands with D, E.\n\nD shakes hands with E.\n\nAnd that's it. So, that's 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, using the combination formula, C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to think about it.\n\nSuppose each person shakes hands with every other person, but we count every handshake twice if we consider it from both persons' perspectives.\n\nWait, no, in combinations, each handshake is unique and only counted once.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is to consider that each handshake involves two people, so the total number of handshakes should be half the product of the number of people and one less than the number of people.\n\nBecause each person shakes hands with (n-1) others, and there are n people, but each handshake is counted twice in that product.\n\nSo, total handshakes = n*(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, 5*4/2 = 20/2 = 10.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, there are 10 handshakes in total.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to generalize this for any number of people.\n\nYes, the formula C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2 gives the number of handshakes for n people.\n\nSo, for 5 people, it's 5*4/2 = 10.\n\nFor 6 people, it would be 6*5/2 = 15, and so on.\n\nIt's good to know this formula because it can be applied to other similar problems, like finding the number of connections in a fully connected network, or the number of games in a round-robin tournament where everyone plays everyone else once.\n\nWait, actually, in a round-robin tournament, it's similar to handshakes, where each team plays every other team once.\n\nSo, the number of games would be C(n, 2), same as the number of handshakes.\n\nThat's an interesting connection.\n\nBut in this specific problem, it's just about handshakes among 5 people.\n\nSo, to summarize, there are 10 handshakes in total.\n\nI'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
