        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing sports. There are 30 students in total, and among them, 16 play soccer, 14 play basketball, and 8 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nI remember there's something called the principle of inclusion-exclusion that might be useful here. It's a way to count things without double-counting when there's overlap. So, in this case, the overlap is the students who play both soccer and basketball.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Total students = 30\n\n- Students playing soccer = 16\n\n- Students playing basketball = 14\n\n- Students playing both = 8\n\nNow, if I just add the number of students playing soccer and basketball, that would be 16 + 14 = 30. But wait, that's the total number of students, which means everyone is playing at least one sport, right? But then, how come there are students playing both sports?\n\nAh, I see. The problem is that when I add 16 and 14, I'm counting the students who play both sports twice\u2014once in soccer and once in basketball. So, to get the total number of students playing at least one sport, I need to subtract those who are counted twice, which is the 8 students who play both.\n\nSo, the number of students playing at least one sport is:\n\n16 (soccer) + 14 (basketball) - 8 (both) = 22 students.\n\nNow, since there are 30 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport would be:\n\n30 - 22 = 8 students.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach could be to use sets. Let's say:\n\n- Set S is the set of students playing soccer, with |S| = 16.\n\n- Set B is the set of students playing basketball, with |B| = 14.\n\n- The intersection of S and B, |S \u2229 B| = 8.\n\nThe number of students playing at least one sport is the union of S and B, which is |S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B| = 16 + 14 - 8 = 22, just like before.\n\nThen, the number of students not playing any sport is the total number minus those playing at least one sport: 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of Venn diagrams. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, the other represents basketball players. The overlapping area is those who play both.\n\nSo, the soccer circle has 16 students, but since 8 of them also play basketball, the unique soccer players are 16 - 8 = 8.\n\nSimilarly, the basketball circle has 14 students, but 8 play both, so unique basketball players are 14 - 8 = 6.\n\nThen, the total number of students playing at least one sport is the unique soccer players plus unique basketball players plus those who play both: 8 + 6 + 8 = 22.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total number of students: 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nHmm, all these methods lead me to the same answer. It seems consistent. Maybe I can try another method to confirm.\n\nLet's consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion again, but more carefully. The formula for two sets is:\n\n|S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B|\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|S \u222a B| = 16 + 14 - 8 = 22\n\nThen, the number of students not in S \u222a B is 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the number of students not playing soccer and not playing basketball.\n\nThe number of students not playing soccer is 30 - 16 = 14.\n\nThe number of students not playing basketball is 30 - 14 = 16.\n\nBut if I add these, I get 14 + 16 = 30, which is the total number of students, but this includes students who don't play either sport and those who play only one sport.\n\nWait, this seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the complement.\n\nThe complement of students playing at least one sport is students playing neither sport.\n\nWe already found that 22 students play at least one sport, so the complement is 30 - 22 = 8, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the students not playing soccer and not playing basketball, that would be the students not in S and not in B, which is the complement of S \u222a B.\n\nSo, again, it's 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this, I end up with 8 students not playing either sport.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I make a table:\n\n- Students playing only soccer: 16 - 8 = 8\n\n- Students playing only basketball: 14 - 8 = 6\n\n- Students playing both: 8\n\n- Students playing neither: ?\n\nTotal students: 30\n\nSo, 8 (only soccer) + 6 (only basketball) + 8 (both) = 22\n\nTherefore, students playing neither is 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The answer is 8 students do not play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
