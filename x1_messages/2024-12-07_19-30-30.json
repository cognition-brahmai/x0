The pyramids were constructed as tombs for pharaohs and their consorts during the Fourth Dynasty, around 2580-2560 BC. The Great Pyramid of Khufu is the largest and most famous of the three pyramids in the Giza complex, and it was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu, also known as Cheops. The pyramids at Giza are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and are a testament to the engineering and architectural skills of the ancient Egyptians."
