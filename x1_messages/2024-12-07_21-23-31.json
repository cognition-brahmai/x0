        "content": "To calculate the present value of a $1000 bond that matures in 5 years with an annual interest rate of 4%, we can use the formula for present value of a single future sum:\n\nPV = FV / (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- PV is the present value\n\n- FV is the future value ($1000 in this case)\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (4%, or 0.04)\n\n- n is the number of years until maturity (5 years)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nPV = 1000 / (1 + 0.04)^5\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.04):\n\n1 + 0.04 = 1.04\n\nThen raise it to the power of 5:\n\n1.04^5 \u2248 1.2166529\n\nNow, divide the future value by this amount:\n\nPV = 1000 / 1.2166529 \u2248 821.93\n\nSo, the present value of the bond is approximately $821.93.\n\nThis makes sense because the present value should be less than the future value due to the time value of money. The higher the interest rate or the longer the time until maturity, the lower the present value will be.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- This calculation assumes that the bond pays no interest before maturity (i.e., it's a zero-coupon bond). If the bond pays periodic interest, we would need to account for those cash flows as well.\n\n- The interest rate used should reflect the opportunity cost of investing in this bond compared to other investments with similar risk.\n\n- In practice, interest rates can change over time, so the present value may fluctuate.\n\n**Alternative Calculation:**\n\nIf the bond pays annual interest, say at a rate of 4%, we would need to calculate the present value of both the interest payments and the final principal repayment.\n\nFor example, if the bond pays $40 annually (4% of $1000), the present value would be the sum of the present values of these cash flows.\n\nBut in this scenario, since it's specified as a $1000 bond maturing in 5 years with no mention of intermediate payments, I've assumed it's a zero-coupon bond.\n\n**Sensitivity to Interest Rates:**\n\nLet's see how sensitive the present value is to changes in the interest rate.\n\n- At 3% interest rate:\n\nPV = 1000 / (1 + 0.03)^5 \u2248 1000 / 1.159274 \u2248 862.61\n\n- At 5% interest rate:\n\nPV = 1000 / (1 + 0.05)^5 \u2248 1000 / 1.276282 \u2248 783.53\n\nSo, a 1% change in interest rate affects the present value by around $40 in this case.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe present value of a $1000 bond maturing in 5 years at an annual interest rate of 4% is approximately $821.93. This calculation assumes it's a zero-coupon bond with no intermediate interest payments. If the bond pays interest periodically, the present value would be higher due to the additional cash flows.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{821.93} \\]"
