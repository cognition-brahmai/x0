        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. First, we have an item that's priced at $200, and there's a discount of 15% on it. So, I need to find out how much the discount is and then subtract that from the original price to get the discounted price. After that, there's a sales tax of 8% that needs to be added to the discounted price to get the final price. Sounds straightforward.\n\nOkay, first step: calculate the discount.\n\nThe discount is 15% of $200. To find 15% of something, I can multiply that something by 0.15. So, $200 multiplied by 0.15 should give me the discount amount.\n\n$200 * 0.15 = $30.\n\nSo, the discount is $30.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.\n\n$200 - $30 = $170.\n\nAlright, so the discounted price is $170.\n\nNext step: calculate the sales tax.\n\nThe sales tax is 8% of the discounted price, which is $170. So, I need to find 8% of $170.\n\nTo find 8% of something, multiply it by 0.08.\n\n$170 * 0.08 = $13.60.\n\nSo, the sales tax is $13.60.\n\nNow, add the sales tax to the discounted price to get the final price.\n\n$170 + $13.60 = $183.60.\n\nTherefore, the final price of the item after the discount and adding the sales tax is $183.60.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the discount: 15% of $200.\n\n$200 * 0.15 = $30. That seems correct.\n\nThen, discounted price: $200 - $30 = $170. Correct.\n\nSales tax: 8% of $170.\n\n$170 * 0.08 = $13.60. Correct.\n\nFinal price: $170 + $13.60 = $183.60. Correct.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{183.60} \\]"
