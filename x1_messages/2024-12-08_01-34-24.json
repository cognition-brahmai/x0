        "content": "The Eiffel Tower was originally intended to be a temporary structure for the Exposition Universelle, also known as the World's Fair, held in Paris in 1889. This event was organized to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution and to showcase technological and cultural achievements from around the world. The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel and his team as the entrance arch to the exposition, and it quickly became its most iconic symbol. Despite initial criticisms from some artists and intellectuals who considered it an eyesore, the tower was ultimately saved from demolition and has since become one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world."
