        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have three candidates in the election: A, B, and C, who received 45%, 35%, and 20% of the votes, respectively. Candidate A won by 4,500 votes, and we need to find out the total number of votes cast in the election.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means that candidate A won by 4,500 votes. I think this means that candidate A received 4,500 more votes than candidate B. Is that correct? Wait, actually, in elections, winning by a certain number of votes usually means that the difference between the vote counts of the winner and the runner-up is that number. So, in this case, since A is the winner and B is the runner-up, the difference between A's and B's votes is 4,500.\n\nLet me denote the total number of votes cast as V. Then, the number of votes candidate A received is 45% of V, which is 0.45V. Similarly, candidate B received 35% of V, which is 0.35V, and candidate C received 20% of V, which is 0.20V.\n\nNow, the difference between A's and B's votes is:\n\n0.45V - 0.35V = 0.10V\n\nAccording to the problem, this difference is 4,500 votes:\n\n0.10V = 4,500\n\nTo find V, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.10:\n\nV = 4,500 / 0.10\nV = 45,000\n\nSo, the total number of votes cast in the election is 45,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If V is 45,000, then A received 45% of 45,000, which is 0.45 * 45,000 = 20,250 votes. Candidate B received 35% of 45,000, which is 0.35 * 45,000 = 15,750 votes. The difference between A and B is 20,250 - 15,750 = 4,500 votes, which matches the given information.\n\nAlso, candidate C received 20% of 45,000, which is 0.20 * 45,000 = 9,000 votes. Adding up all the votes: 20,250 + 15,750 + 9,000 = 45,000, which confirms that the total is correct.\n\nI think this is the right answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"candidate A won by 4,500 votes\" means that A received 4,500 more votes than the combined votes of B and C. But that doesn't make sense in the context of standard election language, where the margin of victory is usually over the next closest candidate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4,500 votes are the excess votes over a certain threshold, but again, that doesn't fit the standard interpretation.\n\nNo, I believe my initial approach is correct. The difference between A's and B's votes is 4,500, which is 10% of the total votes. Therefore, total votes V = 4,500 / 0.10 = 45,000.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up an equation based on the percentages.\n\nLet V be the total votes.\n\nA's votes: 0.45V\n\nB's votes: 0.35V\n\nC's votes: 0.20V\n\nGiven that A won by 4,500 votes over B:\n\n0.45V - 0.35V = 4,500\n\n0.10V = 4,500\n\nV = 4,500 / 0.10\n\nV = 45,000\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other aspect I'm missing. Is there a possibility that the votes are not exactly as per the percentages due to rounding? In real elections, vote counts are whole numbers, and percentages might be rounded. However, for the purpose of this problem, it's acceptable to assume that the percentages given are exact.\n\nAlso, it's assumed that there are only three candidates, and their percentages add up to 100%. In reality, there might be spoiled votes or independent candidates, but based on the problem, we can assume that A, B, and C are the only candidates.\n\nTherefore, the total number of votes cast in the election is 45,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45000} \\]"
