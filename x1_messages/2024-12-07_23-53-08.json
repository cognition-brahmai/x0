        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The garden is currently 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. The owner wants to increase the area by 50% by only extending the length. I need to figure out how many additional meters should be added to the length to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the current area of the garden is. Since it's a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width, right? So, that would be 30 meters times 20 meters, which equals 600 square meters. That's the current area.\n\nNow, the owner wants to increase this area by 50%. So, I need to calculate what 50% of 600 square meters is. 50% of 600 is 0.5 times 600, which equals 300 square meters. Therefore, the new area should be the original area plus this increase, which is 600 plus 300, equaling 900 square meters.\n\nThe plan is to achieve this new area of 900 square meters by only extending the length. The width remains the same at 20 meters. So, if I let the new length be the original length plus some additional meters, which I'll call \"x,\" then the new dimensions will be (30 + x) meters in length and 20 meters in width.\n\nThe area with the extended length would be (30 + x) meters times 20 meters, which should equal the new area of 900 square meters. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n(30 + x) * 20 = 900\n\nNow, I need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, I can divide both sides of the equation by 20 to isolate the term with x:\n\n(30 + x) * 20 / 20 = 900 / 20\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n30 + x = 45\n\nNow, subtract 30 from both sides to solve for x:\n\n30 + x - 30 = 45 - 30\n\nSo, x = 15\n\nTherefore, the owner needs to add 15 meters to the length to increase the area by 50%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the original area is 600 square meters and I'm increasing it by 50%, which is 300 square meters, making the new area 900 square meters, that seems correct.\n\nNow, if I extend the length by 15 meters, the new length would be 30 + 15 = 45 meters. Multiplying that by the width of 20 meters gives 45 * 20 = 900 square meters, which matches the desired new area.\n\nSo, yes, adding 15 meters to the length should do the trick.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
