        "content": "Let's see. I'm trying to recall the standard form of a second-order system's transfer function. I remember that it involves natural frequency and damping ratio, but I need to make sure about the exact arrangement of terms.\n\nOption A has (\u03c9n^2) in the numerator and (s^2 + 2\u03b6\u03c9n s + \u03c9n^2) in the denominator. That seems familiar. Option B is similar but has only \u03b6\u03c9n s instead of 2\u03b6\u03c9n s. Option C has 2\u03c9n s, which is different, and Option D has 2\u03b6 s, which doesn't include \u03c9n in that term.\n\nI think the standard form includes a coefficient of 2 in the damping term. So, perhaps A is correct. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that the general form of a second-order system is:\n\nG(s) = \u03c9n^2 / (s^2 + 2\u03b6\u03c9n s + \u03c9n^2)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03c9n is the natural frequency\n\n- \u03b6 is the damping ratio\n\nYes, that matches Option A.\n\nOption B is missing the coefficient of 2 in the damping term, which would change the system's behavior significantly.\n\nOption C has 2\u03c9n s, which is without the damping ratio \u03b6, which doesn't make sense in the context of standard second-order systems.\n\nOption D has 2\u03b6 s, which misses the \u03c9n term in the damping coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the correct representation should be Option A.\n\nWait a minute, but I've also seen transfer functions written in terms of the denominator being s^2 + 2\u03b6\u03c9n s + \u03c9n^2, with the numerator being \u03c9n^2. Is there another way to represent it?\n\nSometimes, people might write it with different scaling, but in the context of standard second-order systems in control theory, Option A seems correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's another standard form that might match one of the other options.\n\nFor example, sometimes transfer functions are written with the coefficient of s^2 being 1, which is already the case in all options.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might define variables differently, but in the standard context, I believe Option A is correct.\n\nMaybe I should look up a reference or think about the time-domain behavior to confirm.\n\nIn the time domain, the step response of a second-order system depends on the damping ratio \u03b6 and natural frequency \u03c9n. The standard form includes the term 2\u03b6\u03c9n in the denominator, which affects the system's damping.\n\nIf I consider \u03b6 < 1 (underdamped case), the system has oscillations, and the damping coefficient is indeed 2\u03b6\u03c9n.\n\nIf \u03b6 = 1 (critically damped), the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating.\n\nIf \u03b6 > 1 (overdamped), the system returns to equilibrium without oscillating but slower than critically damped.\n\nIn all these cases, the standard form includes 2\u03b6\u03c9n s in the denominator.\n\nTherefore, Option A seems to be the correct representation.\n\nOption B would correspond to a different system with a damping term that is not standard.\n\nOption C lacks the damping ratio \u03b6, which is a crucial parameter in second-order systems.\n\nOption D misses the \u03c9n in the damping term, which wouldn't make physical sense.\n\nHence, I can conclude that Option A is the correct representation of a second-order system's transfer function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
