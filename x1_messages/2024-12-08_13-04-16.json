        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have apples costing $1.50 per pound and oranges costing $2.00 per pound. The customer buys a total of 8 pounds of fruit and spends exactly $12.50. We need to find out how many pounds of each type of fruit they bought.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of pounds of apples.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the number of pounds of oranges.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total weight of the fruit is 8 pounds.\n\n2. The total cost of the fruit is $12.50.\n\nSo, I can write these as equations:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 8 \\) (equation for total weight)\n\n2. \\( 1.50a + 2.00o = 12.50 \\) (equation for total cost)\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables, which I can solve.\n\nFirst, I'll solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 8 - o \\)\n\nNow, I'll substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 1.50(8 - o) + 2.00o = 12.50 \\)\n\nNow, let's distribute the 1.50:\n\n\\( 1.50 \\times 8 = 12.00 \\)\n\n\\( 1.50 \\times (-o) = -1.50o \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( 12.00 - 1.50o + 2.00o = 12.50 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\( 12.00 + ( -1.50o + 2.00o ) = 12.50 \\)\n\n\\( 12.00 + 0.50o = 12.50 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 12.00 from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.50o = 0.50 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.50:\n\n\\( o = 1 \\)\n\nSo, the customer bought 1 pound of oranges.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 8 - o = 8 - 1 = 7 \\)\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 7 pounds of apples and 1 pound of oranges.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal weight: 7 + 1 = 8 pounds \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal cost: (7 pounds \u00d7 $1.50) + (1 pound \u00d7 $2.00) = $10.50 + $2.00 = $12.50 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7 \\text{ pounds of apples and } 1 \\text{ pound of oranges}} \\]"
