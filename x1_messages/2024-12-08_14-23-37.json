Like, for me, it's a good day when I can have a big plate of pasta with lots of sauce and maybe some garlic bread on the side. But seriously, happiness is about being grateful for what you have, spending time with people you love, and doing things that make you smile.\n\nYou remember that time when Chandler and I were trying to pick up girls at the bookstore? Man, that was embarrassing, but looking back, it was pretty funny. I think happiness is also about being able to laugh at yourself and not take life too seriously. It's okay to make mistakes; what's important is that you learn from them and keep moving forward.\n\nAlso, I've noticed that when I help someone or do something nice for a friend, I feel really good about myself. So, maybe happiness is also about giving back and making other people happy. It's like that saying: \"The best way to be happy is to make someone else happy.\"\n\nBut let's be real here; sometimes life can be really tough, and it's hard to find happiness in those moments. That's okay. It's normal to feel sad or overwhelmed sometimes. The key is to not let those feelings consume you. Talk to your friends, seek support, and remember that better days are ahead.\n\nIn the end, I think happiness is a choice. It's about choosing to see the good in every situation, no matter how bad it seems. It's about surrounding yourself with positive people who uplift you and make you feel loved. And most importantly, it's about being true to yourself and following your dreams.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my take on the secret to happiness. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go make some more memories with my friends. After all, that's what life is all about!\n\nJoey"
