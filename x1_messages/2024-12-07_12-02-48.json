I think it's:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, if I have the speed and the time, I can find the distance by multiplying them together.\n\nThe speed is given as 3 miles per hour, and the time is 45 minutes. But I need to make sure that the units are compatible. That is, since the speed is in miles per hour, the time should be in hours.\n\nCurrently, time is in minutes, so I need to convert 45 minutes into hours.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert minutes to hours, I can divide the number of minutes by 60.\n\nSo, 45 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.75 hours.\n\nNow, I can plug the values into the formula:\n\nDistance = 3 miles per hour \u00d7 0.75 hours\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n3 \u00d7 0.75 = 2.25\n\nSo, the distance walked is 2.25 miles.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, the conversion of time:\n\n45 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.75 hours. That seems correct.\n\nThen, multiplying speed by time:\n\n3 miles per hour \u00d7 0.75 hours = 2.25 miles. That also seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: if the person walks 3 miles in one hour, then in 45 minutes, which is 3/4 of an hour, they should walk 3/4 of 3 miles.\n\n3/4 of 3 miles is (3/4) \u00d7 3 = 9/4 = 2.25 miles.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use proportions. If 60 minutes is 3 miles, then 45 minutes is how many miles?\n\nI can set up the proportion: 60 minutes / 45 minutes = 3 miles / x miles\n\nWait, actually, that would be inverse because time and distance are directly proportional.\n\nWait no, in direct proportion, if time increases, distance increases, which makes sense here.\n\nSo, 60 minutes corresponds to 3 miles, so 45 minutes corresponds to (45/60) \u00d7 3 miles.\n\nAgain, that's the same as 0.75 \u00d7 3 = 2.25 miles.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer: 2.25 miles.\n\nTherefore, the person walks 2.25 miles in 45 minutes at an average speed of 3 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.25 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
