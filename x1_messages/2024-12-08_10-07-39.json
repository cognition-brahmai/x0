        "content": "The soft drink you're referring to is Coca-Cola. It was indeed first introduced in 1886 by Dr. John Stith Pemberton, who marketed it as a patent medicine. The name \"Coca-Cola\" comes from two of its original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts. The coca leaves contained trace amounts of cocaine, which was a common ingredient in medicines at the time. However, by 1903, the formula was modified to remove the cocaine, and today's Coca-Cola does not contain any cocaine or coca leaves.\n\nInterestingly, the beverage was initially sold at pharmacies for five cents a glass, and it was promoted as a cure for various ailments, including headaches, exhaustion, and morphine addiction. Over time, Coca-Cola shifted its marketing focus to being a refreshing soft drink, and it has since become one of the most recognizable brands worldwide.\n\nMoreover, the iconic Coca-Cola contour bottle, which was introduced in 1915, was designed to be easily recognized and distinguishable, even in the dark. This design has become an integral part of the brand's identity.\n\nIn terms of global presence, Coca-Cola is available in virtually every corner of the world, with countless variations in flavor and packaging to suit local tastes and preferences. The company has also expanded its portfolio to include a wide range of beverages, from diet sodas to juices and bottled water.\n\nCoca-Cola's advertising campaigns have been groundbreaking, often focusing on themes of happiness, unity, and nostalgia. One of the most famous campaigns is the \"Share a Coke\" series, where personalized bottles with people's names replaced the traditional logo, encouraging consumers to share a Coke with friends and family.\n\nDespite its long history and success, Coca-Cola has also faced criticisms over the years, particularly regarding its impact on public health due to the high sugar content in its beverages. In response, the company has introduced several low- and no-calorie options to its lineup.\n\nOverall, Coca-Cola's journey from a patent medicine to a global soft drink phenomenon is a testament to its enduring appeal and adaptability in the ever-changing consumer market."
