        "content": "Let's see. Sarah bought 3 packs of pencils, and each pack has 12 pencils. So first, I need to find out how many pencils she has in total.\n\nI can multiply the number of packs by the number of pencils per pack:\n\n3 packs * 12 pencils/pack = 36 pencils\n\nSo, Sarah has 36 pencils in total.\n\nNext, she gave 2 pencils to each of her 5 friends. To find out how many pencils she gave away, I can multiply the number of friends by the number of pencils per friend:\n\n5 friends * 2 pencils/friend = 10 pencils\n\nSo, she gave away 10 pencils.\n\nNow, to find out how many pencils she has left, I need to subtract the number of pencils she gave away from the total number of pencils she had initially:\n\n36 pencils - 10 pencils = 26 pencils\n\nTherefore, Sarah has 26 pencils left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]"
