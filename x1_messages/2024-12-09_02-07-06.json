        "content": "So there are 10 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. We need to find out two things: first, the total number of handshakes that occur, and second, how many handshakes John has.\n\nLet's start with the total number of handshakes. When you have a group of people and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, the total number of handshakes can be calculated using the formula for combinations. Specifically, it's the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 10 to shake hands, because a handshake involves two people.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), so the total number of handshakes is:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\times 8!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 8! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 45 handshakes in total.\n\nNow, for the second part: how many handshakes does John have?\n\nJohn is one of the 10 people in the room. He shakes hands with every other person exactly once. Since there are 10 people, the number of other people John shakes hands with is \\( 10 - 1 = 9 \\).\n\nTherefore, John has 9 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, but there's a slight confusion here. The question mentions John and Jane specifically, but since John is just one person, and we've already determined that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, John should indeed have 9 handshakes.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure we're not missing something.\n\nIf there are 10 people, and each shakes hands with every other person exactly once, then indeed, each person shakes hands with 9 other people.\n\nSo, John has 9 handshakes.\n\nBut the question also mentions Jane, who is also one of the 10 people. However, since the question only asks for the total number of handshakes and how many John has, we don't need to consider Jane further unless specified otherwise.\n\nUnless perhaps there's some condition involving Jane, but the question doesn't seem to indicate any special condition related to Jane.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 45, and John has 9 handshakes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nAnother way to think about the total number of handshakes is to consider that each of the 10 people shakes hands with 9 others, which would initially suggest \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\) handshakes. However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2 to get the correct total number of unique handshakes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total handshakes} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation using combinations.\n\nSimilarly, for John, since he shakes hands with each of the other 9 people exactly once, he has 9 handshakes.\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\n- Total handshakes: 45\n\n- John's handshakes: 9\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45 \\text{ total handshakes, John has 9 handshakes}} \\]"
