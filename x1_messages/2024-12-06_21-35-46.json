        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The original dimensions are a length of 25 meters and a width of 10 meters. The owner wants to increase the area by 50% but only by extending the length. I need to figure out what the new length should be.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the original area of the garden is. Since it's a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, original area = length \u00d7 width = 25 m \u00d7 10 m = 250 square meters.\n\nNow, the owner wants to increase this area by 50%. So, the increase in area would be 50% of 250 m\u00b2. Let me calculate that: 50% of 250 is 0.5 \u00d7 250 = 125 m\u00b2. Therefore, the new area should be the original area plus the increase: 250 m\u00b2 + 125 m\u00b2 = 375 m\u00b2.\n\nThe tricky part is that only the length is being increased, while the width stays the same at 10 meters. So, the new area is going to be new length \u00d7 original width = new length \u00d7 10 m = 375 m\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote the new length as L. So, L \u00d7 10 = 375.\n\nTo find L, I can divide both sides of the equation by 10: L = 375 m\u00b2 / 10 m = 37.5 meters.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if I'm missing anything. The width remains 10 meters, and the new length is 37.5 meters, which would give an area of 37.5 m \u00d7 10 m = 375 m\u00b2, which is indeed a 50% increase from the original 250 m\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages. If the width stays the same, and I only increase the length by some factor, the area will increase by that same factor. But in this case, I'm supposed to increase the area by 50%, so the factor is 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150% = 1.5 times the original area).\n\nGiven that, and since width remains constant, the length needs to be increased by the same factor to achieve the desired area increase. So, new length = original length \u00d7 1.5 = 25 m \u00d7 1.5 = 37.5 m.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37.5 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
