        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. There's a water tank that can hold 12,000 liters, and it's currently empty. There's a faucet that fills the tank at a rate of 15 liters per minute. I need to figure out how many hours it will take to fill the tank completely.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I need to find the time it takes to fill the tank, and the answer should be in hours. I know the tank's total capacity is 12,000 liters, and the faucet adds 15 liters every minute. So, basically, I need to find out how many minutes it takes to reach 12,000 liters by adding 15 liters each minute, and then convert that time into hours.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. If the faucet adds 15 liters every minute, then in one minute, the tank gets 15 liters. So, to find out how many minutes it takes to reach 12,000 liters, I can divide the total capacity by the rate of flow.\n\nSo, time in minutes = total volume / flow rate\n\nThat would be:\n\ntime = 12,000 liters / 15 liters per minute\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n12,000 divided by 15 is... hmm, 15 times 800 is 12,000. So, time = 800 minutes.\n\nBut the question asks for hours, not minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert minutes to hours, I need to divide the number of minutes by 60.\n\nSo, time in hours = time in minutes / 60\n\nThat would be:\n\ntime = 800 minutes / 60\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n800 divided by 60 is... 60 times 13 is 780, and 800 minus 780 is 20, so 13 hours and 20 minutes. But since the question probably expects the answer in hours, I can express it as a decimal.\n\nSo, 800 divided by 60 is 13.333... hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as 13 hours and 20 minutes, but since the question specifies hours, I'll go with the decimal form.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a better way to approach this. Maybe I can directly find the rate in liters per hour and then find the time.\n\nLet's see. If the faucet fills at 15 liters per minute, then in one hour, which has 60 minutes, it would fill 15 * 60 = 900 liters per hour.\n\nSo, if the tank is 12,000 liters, and the faucet fills at 900 liters per hour, then the time required would be:\n\ntime = total volume / flow rate per hour\n\ntime = 12,000 liters / 900 liters per hour\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n12,000 divided by 900 is... 900 times 13 is 11,700, and 12,000 minus 11,700 is 300. So, 13 hours plus 300 liters.\n\nNow, since the faucet fills at 900 liters per hour, 300 liters would take 300 / 900 = 1/3 of an hour, which is 20 minutes.\n\nSo, again, I get 13 hours and 20 minutes, or 13.333... hours.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the units and make sure they cancel out correctly.\n\nSo, starting with 12,000 liters, and a flow rate of 15 liters per minute, I can set up the time as:\n\ntime (minutes) = 12,000 liters / 15 liters per minute\n\nThe liters cancel out, leaving minutes, which is correct.\n\nThen, to convert to hours, I divide by 60 minutes per hour:\n\ntime (hours) = (12,000 / 15) minutes / 60 minutes per hour\n\nAgain, minutes cancel out, leaving hours.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n12,000 / 15 = 800 minutes\n\n800 / 60 = 13.333... hours\n\nAlternatively, I could combine the operations:\n\ntime (hours) = 12,000 / (15 * 60)\n\nSince 15 * 60 = 900, again, 12,000 / 900 = 13.333... hours\n\nAll these approaches confirm the same result.\n\nI think I've got it. It will take approximately 13.333 hours to fill the tank, or exactly 13 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nBut since the question asks for hours, I should probably present it as a decimal.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 13.333 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if the context requires more precision, I could express it as 13 hours and 20 minutes, but the question specifies hours.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13.\\overline{3}} \\]"
