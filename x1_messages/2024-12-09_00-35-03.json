        "content": "Yes, humans generally have a weaker sense of smell compared to many other animals, including dogs and rodents. This is due to differences in the number and type of olfactory receptors in their noses.\n\nDogs, for example, have about 300 million olfactory receptors, while humans have only about 5 million. This allows dogs to detect scents at much lower concentrations and over greater distances. Rodents also have a highly developed sense of smell, with a large number of olfactory receptors and a well-developed olfactory bulb in their brains.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that humans are still capable of detecting a wide range of smells and can even differentiate between similar odors. Additionally, our sense of smell is closely linked to memory and emotion, which gives it a unique importance in our lives."
