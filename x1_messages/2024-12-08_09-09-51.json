        "content": "Let's see. So in this town, 60% of the population has cats, and 40% has dogs. But, 20% has both cats and dogs. I need to find out what percentage doesn't have any pets.\n\nHmm, I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. You know, where you add the percentages of people who have cats and dogs, but since some people have both, you subtract that overlap so you don't double-count them.\n\nSo, first, 60% have cats, and 40% have dogs. If I add those up, that's 100%. But wait, that includes people who have both cats and dogs twice, once in each category. So, I need to subtract the 20% who have both to correct for that.\n\nSo, 60% + 40% = 100%, and then subtract 20% for the overlap: 100% - 20% = 80%. That means 80% of the population has at least one pet, either a cat or a dog or both.\n\nNow, to find out who doesn't have any pets, I subtract that 80% from the total population, which is 100%. So, 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nTherefore, 20% of the population doesn't have any pets.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose the total population is 100 people for simplicity.\n\n- 60 people have cats.\n\n- 40 people have dogs.\n\n- 20 people have both cats and dogs.\n\nSo, the number of people who have only cats is 60 - 20 = 40 people.\n\nThe number of people who have only dogs is 40 - 20 = 20 people.\n\nAnd 20 people have both.\n\nSo, the total number of people who have at least one pet is 40 (only cats) + 20 (only dogs) + 20 (both) = 80 people.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who don't have any pets is 100 - 80 = 20 people, which is 20%.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. I think 20% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
