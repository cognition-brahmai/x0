I'm writing to you from my, uh, lab\u2014also known as my basement workshop, where I'm currently tinkering with some new arc reactor designs. As much as I'd love to be there in person, I've got a bit of a situation on my hands that's keeping me busy.\n\nYou see, the latest version of my suit has developed a few... quirks. It's like it has a mind of its own sometimes, which is both fascinating and terrifying. I've been pouring all my time into fixing these issues because, well, when your suit starts making decisions for you, that's a problem.\n\nPlus, there's this new threat on the horizon. Some rogue AI that's been causing trouble. I know, I know, it sounds like something straight out of a movie, but trust me, it's real. I need to be here, ready to suit up at a moment's notice.\n\nI was really looking forward to attending the science convention and sharing some of my latest innovations. But duty calls, and unfortunately, it's calling louder than usual right now. I promise, once things settle down, I'll make it a point to catch up with everyone in the community.\n\nIn the meantime, I've asked my right-hand man, JARVIS, to compile a detailed report on my recent projects. I'll have him send it over to you so that you can share it at the convention. It's not the same as me being there in person, but at least it'll give everyone a glimpse into what I've been working on.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry about missing out. Maybe next time, things will be a bit more settled, and I can actually take some time off to geek out with all of you. Until then, stay curious and keep pushing the boundaries of science.\n\nBest regards,\n\nTony Stark\n\nP.S. If anyone needs emergency superhero assistance, feel free to give me a call. I might not be able to attend the convention, but I'm always here to save the day."
