        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. I have a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and among them, there are 13 spades. I need to find the probability that if I draw four cards at random without replacement, exactly two of them will be spades.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw four cards from 52 without regard to order. That sounds like a combination problem. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose four cards from 52 is:\n\n\\[ C(52, 4) = \\frac{52!}{4!(52 - 4)!} \\]\n\nBut calculating factorials for such large numbers can be cumbersome. Maybe there's a simpler way to think about this.\n\nNow, for the numerator, which is the number of favorable outcomes, I need to find the number of ways to choose exactly two spades from the 13 available spades and two non-spades from the remaining 39 cards (since there are 52 - 13 = 39 non-spades).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose two spades from 13 is:\n\n\\[ C(13, 2) = \\frac{13!}{2!(13 - 2)!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12}{2 \\times 1} = 78 \\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose two non-spades from 39 is:\n\n\\[ C(39, 2) = \\frac{39!}{2!(39 - 2)!} = \\frac{39 \\times 38}{2 \\times 1} = 741 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the product of these two combinations, because these are independent choices:\n\n\\[ \\text{Favorable outcomes} = C(13, 2) \\times C(39, 2) = 78 \\times 741 = 57,798 \\]\n\nNow, going back to the total number of possible outcomes, which is:\n\n\\[ C(52, 4) = \\frac{52!}{4!(52 - 4)!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 270,725 \\]\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly two spades}) = \\frac{57,798}{270,725} \\]\n\nBut let's see if we can simplify this fraction. Dividing numerator and denominator by, say, 13:\n\n\\[ 57,798 \u00f7 13 = 4,446 \\]\n\n\\[ 270,725 \u00f7 13 = 20,825 \\]\n\nSo, it becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,446}{20,825} \\]\n\nIs this the simplest form? Let's check if there's a common divisor. 4,446 and 20,825.\n\nLooking at 4,446:\n\nIt's even, so divisible by 2. 20,825 is odd, so not divisible by 2. Next, 5: 4,446 doesn't end with 5 or 0, so not divisible by 5. Next, 10: same issue.\n\nWhat about 13? 4,446 \u00f7 13 is approximately 342, and 20,825 \u00f7 13 is approximately 1,602. Not exact divisions.\n\nMaybe 3: 4 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 18, which is divisible by 3. 20,825: 2 + 0 + 8 + 2 + 5 = 17, which is not divisible by 3. So, no.\n\nNext, 7: 4,446 \u00f7 7 is approximately 635.14, not exact. 20,825 \u00f7 7 is approximately 2,975, which seems exact because 7 times 2,975 is 20,825.\n\nSo, dividing numerator and denominator by 7:\n\n\\[ 4,446 \u00f7 7 = 635.14 \\] Wait, that's not exact. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 7 times 2,975 is indeed 20,825. Let's check 4,446 \u00f7 7:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 635 = 4,445 \\]\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 635.14 \\] That doesn't make sense. So, it's not divisible by 7.\n\nPerhaps it's already in its simplest form. So, the probability is \\(\\frac{4,446}{20,825}\\).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to leave it in terms of original combinations without simplifying too much. Alternatively, we can calculate it as a decimal for better understanding.\n\nSo, calculating \\(\\frac{57,798}{270,725}\\):\n\nDividing 57,798 by 270,725 gives approximately 0.2134.\n\nSo, the probability is roughly 0.2134, or 21.34%.\n\nBut maybe there's a more precise or a different way to approach this problem, perhaps using probabilities step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the probability of choosing two spades and two non-spades in any order.\n\nThe probability of drawing a spade on the first draw is \\(\\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nGiven that the first card is a spade, the probability that the second card is also a spade is \\(\\frac{12}{51}\\), since one spade is already drawn.\n\nThen, the probability that the third card is a non-spade is \\(\\frac{39}{50}\\), and the fourth card is a non-spade is \\(\\frac{38}{49}\\).\n\nBut this is for a specific order: spade, spade, non-spade, non-spade.\n\nHowever, the two spades and two non-spades can be in any order. The number of such orders is the number of ways to arrange two spades and two non-spades, which is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the total probability is 6 times the probability of one specific order.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P = 6 \\times \\left( \\frac{13}{52} \\times \\frac{12}{51} \\times \\frac{39}{50} \\times \\frac{38}{49} \\right) \\]\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses:\n\nFirst, \\(\\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nThen, \\(\\frac{12}{51} = \\frac{4}{17}\\)\n\nNext, \\(\\frac{39}{50}\\) remains as is.\n\nFinally, \\(\\frac{38}{49}\\) remains as is.\n\nSo, multiplying them together:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{17} \\times \\frac{39}{50} \\times \\frac{38}{49} = \\frac{1 \\times 4 \\times 39 \\times 38}{4 \\times 17 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nSimplifying numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: \\(1 \\times 4 \\times 39 \\times 38 = 4 \\times 39 \\times 38 = 156 \\times 38 = 5,928\\)\n\nDenominator: \\(4 \\times 17 \\times 50 \\times 49 = 4 \\times 17 = 68\\), then 68 \u00d7 50 = 3,400, then 3,400 \u00d7 49 = 166,600\\)\n\nSo, the fraction is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,928}{166,600} \\]\n\nNow, multiplying this by 6:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times \\frac{5,928}{166,600} = \\frac{35,568}{166,600} \\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 8:\n\n\\[ 35,568 \u00f7 8 = 4,446 \\]\n\n\\[ 166,600 \u00f7 8 = 20,825 \\]\n\nSo, again, we get \\(\\frac{4,446}{20,825}\\), which is approximately 0.2134 or 21.34%.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm more confident now.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of hypergeometric distribution, since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\frac{C(K, k) \\times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the population size (52 cards),\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (13 spades),\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of draws (4 cards),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (2 spades).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(X = 2) = \\frac{C(13, 2) \\times C(52 - 13, 4 - 2)}{C(52, 4)} = \\frac{C(13, 2) \\times C(39, 2)}{C(52, 4)} \\]\n\nWhich is exactly what I calculated earlier:\n\n\\[ \\frac{78 \\times 741}{270,725} = \\frac{57,798}{270,725} = \\frac{4,446}{20,825} \\approx 0.2134 \\]\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same result, which reinforces my confidence in the answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can check if there's another way to look at this. For example, using permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf I consider the order matters, then the total number of ways to draw four cards from 52 is \\( P(52, 4) = 52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\).\n\nThe number of ways to choose two spades from 13 is \\( P(13, 2) = 13 \\times 12 \\), and two non-spades from 39 is \\( P(39, 2) = 39 \\times 38 \\).\n\nBut since order matters here, I need to consider all possible arrangements of two spades and two non-spades.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange two spades and two non-spades in four positions is \\( \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable permutations is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times (13 \\times 12) \\times (39 \\times 38) \\]\n\nAnd the total number of permutations is:\n\n\\[ 52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\]\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{6 \\times (13 \\times 12) \\times (39 \\times 38)}{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\nNumerator:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 39 \\times 38 = 6 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 39 \\times 38 \\]\n\nDenominator:\n\n\\[ 52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this step by step. First, note that 52 = 4 \u00d7 13, so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 39 \\times 38}{4 \\times 13 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nCancel out the 13 in numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6 \\times 12 \\times 39 \\times 38}{4 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nNow, 6 and 4 can be simplified: 6 \u00f7 2 = 3, 4 \u00f7 2 = 2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 12 \\times 39 \\times 38}{2 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nNext, 12 and 2: 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, 2 \u00f7 2 = 1:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 6 \\times 39 \\times 38}{51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nNow, 3 and 51: 51 \u00f7 3 = 17:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 6 \\times 39 \\times 38}{17 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nThe 3 in numerator and 17 in denominator can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, multiplying numerator:\n\n3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n\n18 \u00d7 39 = 702\n\n702 \u00d7 38 = 26,676\n\nDenominator:\n\n17 \u00d7 50 = 850\n\n850 \u00d7 49 = 41,650\n\nSo, the fraction is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{26,676}{41,650} \\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{13,338}{20,825} \\]\n\nThis is different from the earlier fraction of \\(\\frac{4,446}{20,825}\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me check the steps again.\n\nAfter canceling out the common factors, I had:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 6 \\times 39 \\times 38}{17 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n\n18 \u00d7 39 = 702\n\n702 \u00d7 38 = 26,676\n\nDenominator:\n\n17 \u00d7 50 = 850\n\n850 \u00d7 49 = 41,650\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{26,676}{41,650}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{13,338}{20,825}\\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 2.\n\nBut earlier, using combinations, I got \\(\\frac{4,446}{20,825}\\). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the permutation approach.\n\nLet me re-examine the permutation method.\n\nIn permutations, the total number of ways to draw four cards in order is indeed \\( P(52, 4) = 52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\).\n\nThe number of ways to choose two spades in order is \\( P(13, 2) = 13 \\times 12 \\), and two non-spades in order is \\( P(39, 2) = 39 \\times 38 \\).\n\nSince the two spades and two non-spades can be in any order, there are \\( \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \\) ways to arrange them.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable permutations is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times (13 \\times 12) \\times (39 \\times 38) \\]\n\nAnd the total number of possible permutations is:\n\n\\[ 52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{6 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 39 \\times 38}{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nNow, simplifying step by step.\n\nFirst, note that 52 = 4 \u00d7 13, so:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{6 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 39 \\times 38}{4 \\times 13 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nCancel the 13 in numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{6 \\times 12 \\times 39 \\times 38}{4 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nNow, 6 and 4: divide numerator by 2 and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{3 \\times 12 \\times 39 \\times 38}{2 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nNext, 12 and 2: divide numerator by 2 and denominator by 1:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{3 \\times 6 \\times 39 \\times 38}{51 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nNow, 3 and 51: 51 \u00f7 3 = 17:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{3 \\times 6 \\times 39 \\times 38}{17 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nWait, actually, 51 \u00f7 3 = 17, so:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{1 \\times 6 \\times 39 \\times 38}{17 \\times 50 \\times 49} \\]\n\nBecause 3 \u00f7 3 = 1.\n\nNow, calculating numerator:\n\n1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n\n6 \u00d7 39 = 234\n\n234 \u00d7 38 = 8,904\n\nDenominator:\n\n17 \u00d7 50 = 850\n\n850 \u00d7 49 = 41,650\n\nSo, \\( P = \\frac{8,904}{41,650} \\)\n\nSimplifying this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,452}{20,825} \\]\n\nWait, but earlier with combinations, I had \\(\\frac{4,446}{20,825}\\). There's a discrepancy of 6 here. Maybe I miscalculated the multiplication.\n\nLet me recalculate 234 \u00d7 38:\n\n234 \u00d7 30 = 7,020\n\n234 \u00d7 8 = 1,872\n\nTotal = 7,020 + 1,872 = 8,892\n\nSo, numerator is 8,892\n\nDenominator is 41,650\n\nSo, \\( P = \\frac{8,892}{41,650} \\)\n\nSimplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,446}{20,825} \\]\n\nNow, this matches the earlier result from combinations.\n\nSo, the correct probability is \\(\\frac{4,446}{20,825}\\), which is approximately 0.2135 or 21.35%.\n\nIt seems I made a multiplication error earlier in the permutation method, leading to confusion. But now it's consistent with the combination method.\n\nAlternatively, to cross-verify, I can calculate the probability using software or a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll trust the calculations.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly two spades when drawing four cards from a standard deck is \\(\\frac{4,446}{20,825}\\), or approximately 21.35%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4446}{20825}} \\]"
