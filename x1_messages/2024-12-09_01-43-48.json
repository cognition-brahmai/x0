        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling between two towns, Town A and Town B, which are 120 miles apart. The train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour and then returns to Town A at 40 miles per hour. I need to find the average speed for the entire round trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, I need to find the total distance and the total time for the round trip.\n\nThe total distance is straightforward. Since the train goes from Town A to Town B and back to Town A, that's 120 miles each way, so total distance is 120 miles + 120 miles = 240 miles.\n\nNow, I need to find the total time taken for the trip. To do that, I need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip and then add them together.\n\nFirst, the time taken to go from Town A to Town B. The distance is 120 miles and the speed is 60 mph. Time is distance divided by speed, so time = 120 miles / 60 mph = 2 hours.\n\nNext, the time taken to return from Town B to Town A. The distance is again 120 miles, but the speed is 40 mph. So, time = 120 miles / 40 mph = 3 hours.\n\nNow, the total time for the round trip is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nFinally, the average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 240 miles / 5 hours = 48 mph.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal distance: 120 miles each way, so 240 miles.\n\nTime to Town B: 120 miles / 60 mph = 2 hours.\n\nTime back to Town A: 120 miles / 40 mph = 3 hours.\n\nTotal time: 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed: 240 miles / 5 hours = 48 mph.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I think the answer is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
