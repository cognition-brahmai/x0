        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving from City A to City B going at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaving from City B to City A at 90 miles per hour. The distance between the cities is 450 miles. I need to find out how far apart they'll be when they pass each other.\n\nFirst, I should figure out when they pass each other. Since they're leaving at the same time and moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the combined speed is 60 mph plus 90 mph, which is 150 mph. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at 150 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between the cities is 450 miles. To find the time it takes for them to pass each other, I can divide the total distance by their combined speed. So, time = distance divided by speed, which is 450 miles divided by 150 mph. That gives me 3 hours. So, they'll pass each other after 3 hours.\n\nBut the question is, how far apart will they be when they pass each other. Hmm, when they pass each other, aren't they at the same point? So, the distance between them should be zero. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nLet me read it again. \"How far apart will the trains be when they pass each other?\" Well, \"passing each other\" usually means they are at the same point, so the distance between them is zero. But perhaps there's something else I'm missing.\n\nMaybe the question is about how far each train has traveled when they pass each other, or something like that. But the question specifically asks for the distance apart when they pass each other, which should be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding about the meaning of \"passing each other.\" In train problems, sometimes it refers to the moment when they meet or cross each other. In that case, the distance between them is zero.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the distances each train travels in 3 hours. The first train is going at 60 mph, so in 3 hours, it covers 60 times 3, which is 180 miles. The second train is going at 90 mph, so in 3 hours, it covers 90 times 3, which is 270 miles.\n\nNow, if you add the distances they've each traveled, 180 miles plus 270 miles, that's 450 miles, which is exactly the distance between the cities. That makes sense because they've covered the entire distance between them.\n\nSo, when they pass each other, the sum of the distances they've traveled is equal to the initial distance between the cities. Therefore, they are right next to each other, meaning the distance apart is zero.\n\nBut maybe the question is worded poorly, and it's actually asking for the distance each train has traveled when they meet. In that case, the first train has traveled 180 miles, and the second train has traveled 270 miles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the distance from a particular city when they pass each other. For example, how far from City A or City B they are when they meet.\n\nWait, let's check the question again: \"How far apart will the trains be when they pass each other?\" It seems clear that it's asking for the distance between them at the moment they pass each other.\n\nGiven that, and the earlier calculations, the answer should be zero miles.\n\nHowever, to double-check, let's consider their positions at 3 hours.\n\nTrain from A to B:\n\n- Starts at A, goes 60 mph for 3 hours, so it's 180 miles from A, towards B.\n\nTrain from B to A:\n\n- Starts at B, goes 90 mph for 3 hours, so it's 270 miles from B, towards A.\n\nGiven that the total distance is 450 miles, if one has traveled 180 miles from A and the other has traveled 270 miles from B, their positions coincide because 180 + 270 = 450 miles.\n\nTherefore, they are at the same point, and the distance between them is zero.\n\nI think the answer is zero miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
