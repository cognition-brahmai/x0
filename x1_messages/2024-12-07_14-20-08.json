        "content": "So the factory originally produces 1500 widgets per hour. They're increasing their production by 25%. I need to find out how many widgets they'll produce in 10 hours at this new rate.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the new production rate is after the 25% increase. To do that, I can calculate 25% of 1500 and then add that to the original 1500 widgets per hour.\n\nSo, 25% of 1500 is calculated as (25/100) * 1500. That's 0.25 times 1500, which is 375 widgets per hour.\n\nAdding that to the original production: 1500 + 375 = 1875 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how many widgets are produced in 10 hours at this new rate, I just need to multiply the new hourly production rate by 10.\n\nSo, 1875 widgets/hour * 10 hours = 18,750 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to do this? Maybe without calculating the increase separately.\n\nI recall that increasing a quantity by a certain percentage can be done by multiplying the original quantity by (1 + the percentage increase in decimal form).\n\nSo, in this case, it would be 1500 * (1 + 0.25) = 1500 * 1.25.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1500 * 1.25 = 1875 widgets per hour, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, multiplying by 10 hours gives 1875 * 10 = 18,750 widgets.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that a 25% increase means the factory is producing 125% of its original production rate.\n\nSo, 125% of 1500 is (125/100) * 1500 = 1.25 * 1500 = 1875 widgets per hour.\n\nAgain, multiplying by 10 hours gives 18,750 widgets.\n\nHmm, consistent results. I feel confident now.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 18,750 widgets in 10 hours at the new production rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18750} \\]"
