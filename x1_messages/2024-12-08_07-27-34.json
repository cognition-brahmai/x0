        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a bacterial colony that doubles in size every 20 minutes, and I need to figure out how many bacteria there will be after 2 hours, starting with an initial population of 500. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The colony doubles every 20 minutes, and I need to know the population after 2 hours. Since 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, I can calculate how many 20-minute intervals there are in 120 minutes. That should tell me how many times the colony doubles in size.\n\nSo, 120 minutes divided by 20 minutes per doubling is 6. So, the colony doubles 6 times in 2 hours.\n\nNow, if the colony doubles every 20 minutes, starting from 500 bacteria, then after each doubling period, the number of bacteria is multiplied by 2.\n\nLet me write this out step by step.\n\nInitial population: 500\n\nAfter 20 minutes: 500 * 2 = 1000\n\nAfter 40 minutes: 1000 * 2 = 2000\n\nAfter 60 minutes: 2000 * 2 = 4000\n\nAfter 80 minutes: 4000 * 2 = 8000\n\nAfter 100 minutes: 8000 * 2 = 16,000\n\nAfter 120 minutes: 16,000 * 2 = 32,000\n\nSo, after 2 hours, there would be 32,000 bacteria.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without listing each step? Because if the doubling time or the total time changes, listing each step might not be efficient.\n\nI recall that exponential growth can be modeled by the formula:\n\nFinal population = initial population * (growth factor)^(time / doubling time)\n\nIn this case, the growth factor is 2, since the population doubles.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nFinal population = 500 * 2^(120 / 20)\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent: 120 divided by 20 is 6.\n\nSo, it's 500 * 2^6.\n\n2^6 is 64.\n\nTherefore, 500 * 64 = 32,000.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by listing each step.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure that the formula is correct.\n\nExponential growth formula is generally:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(kt)\n\nWhere N(t) is the population at time t, N0 is the initial population, k is the growth rate, and t is time.\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with doubling time, it's easier to use the formula I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can relate it to the doubling time.\n\nThe doubling time is 20 minutes, so the growth rate k can be found using the formula:\n\nDoubling time = ln(2) / k\n\nSo, k = ln(2) / doubling time.\n\nIn this case, doubling time is 20 minutes, so k = ln(2) / 20.\n\nThen, the exponential growth formula becomes:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^( (ln(2)/20) * t )\n\nGiven t = 120 minutes,\n\nN(120) = 500 * e^( (ln(2)/20) * 120 )\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n(ln(2)/20)*120 = (ln(2)*120)/20 = (ln(2)*6) = ln(2^6) = ln(64)\n\nSo, N(120) = 500 * e^(ln(64)) = 500 * 64 = 32,000.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is indeed 32,000 bacteria after 2 hours.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the growth, like limited resources or space. But the problem doesn't mention any constraints, so it's safe to assume unlimited growth in this scenario.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The doubling time is in minutes, and the total time is in hours, but I converted hours to minutes, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I had kept the times in hours, I would need to convert the doubling time accordingly.\n\nBut in this case, using minutes was straightforward.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. The problem seems straightforward, and I've verified the calculation using different methods, all leading to the same answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is 32,000 bacteria after 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32000} \\]"
