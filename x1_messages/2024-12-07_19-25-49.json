        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria doubling every 3 hours. Starting with 1,000 bacteria, I need to figure out how many there'll be after 24 hours. Hmm, exponential growth, right? I remember that when something doubles at regular intervals, it follows an exponential growth pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the doubling time. It says every 3 hours, so the population multiplies by 2 every 3 hours. So, in 24 hours, how many 3-hour periods are there? Let me calculate that.\n\n24 hours divided by 3 hours per period is 8 periods. So, there are 8 times that the bacteria population doubles in 24 hours.\n\nNow, starting with 1,000 bacteria, if it doubles once, it becomes 2,000. Double again, it's 4,000, and so on. So, after each period, the population is multiplied by 2.\n\nSo, the formula for exponential growth in this case should be:\n\nFinal population = initial population * (growth factor)^(number of periods)\n\nHere, the growth factor is 2, and the number of periods is 8.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nFinal population = 1,000 * 2^8\n\nNow, 2^8 is 256, right? Because 2 to the power of 8 is 256.\n\nSo, 1,000 * 256 = 256,000.\n\nWait, that seems pretty straightforward. But let me double-check if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the exponential growth formula:\n\nFinal population = initial population * e^(rt)\n\nWhere r is the growth rate and t is time. But in this case, since it's doubling every 3 hours, maybe using the doubling time formula would be more appropriate.\n\nThe doubling time formula is:\n\nFinal population = initial population * 2^(t/T)\n\nWhere t is the total time, and T is the doubling time.\n\nSo, in this case, t is 24 hours, and T is 3 hours.\n\nSo, Final population = 1,000 * 2^(24/3) = 1,000 * 2^8 = 1,000 * 256 = 256,000\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if I can derive the growth rate r and use the exponential formula.\n\nFirst, find r such that the population doubles every 3 hours.\n\nSo, 2 = e^(3r)\n\nTaking natural log on both sides:\n\nln(2) = 3r\n\nTherefore, r = ln(2)/3\n\nNow, using the exponential growth formula:\n\nFinal population = 1,000 * e^(r*24) = 1,000 * e^((ln(2)/3)*24) = 1,000 * e^(ln(2)*8) = 1,000 * e^(ln(256)) = 1,000 * 256 = 256,000\n\nAgain, the same result. So, it seems consistent.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using logarithms to solve for the final population.\n\nSuppose I don't know the formula, and I want to think about it step by step.\n\nStarting with 1,000 bacteria.\n\nAfter 3 hours: 1,000 * 2 = 2,000\n\nAfter 6 hours: 2,000 * 2 = 4,000\n\nAfter 9 hours: 4,000 * 2 = 8,000\n\nAfter 12 hours: 8,000 * 2 = 16,000\n\nAfter 15 hours: 16,000 * 2 = 32,000\n\nAfter 18 hours: 32,000 * 2 = 64,000\n\nAfter 21 hours: 64,000 * 2 = 128,000\n\nAfter 24 hours: 128,000 * 2 = 256,000\n\nAgain, the same answer: 256,000 bacteria after 24 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the general exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P0 * a^t\n\nWhere P0 is the initial population, a is the growth factor, and t is time.\n\nBut in this case, the doubling is every 3 hours, so the formula needs to account for the number of periods.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier: P(t) = P0 * 2^(t/T), where T is the doubling time.\n\nSo, P(24) = 1,000 * 2^(24/3) = 1,000 * 2^8 = 256,000.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to think in terms of continuous growth, using the formula P(t) = P0 * e^(rt), where r is the continuous growth rate.\n\nAs I did earlier, r = ln(2)/3 per hour.\n\nSo, P(24) = 1,000 * e^( (ln(2)/3)*24 ) = 1,000 * e^( ln(2)*8 ) = 1,000 * 2^8 = 256,000.\n\nEither way, I end up with the same number.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently through multiple methods.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 256,000 bacteria after 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{256000} \\]"
