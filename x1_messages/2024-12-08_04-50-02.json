        "content": "So I have this problem here: if it takes 5 workers 3 hours to build a wall, how long will it take 15 workers to build the same wall? Hmm, this seems like a straightforward problem involving inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a task. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken. If more workers are doing the job, it should take less time, right? So, it's an inverse proportion. That means that the product of the number of workers and the time taken should be constant, assuming each worker works at the same rate.\n\nSo, for 5 workers taking 3 hours, the worker-hours required to build the wall would be 5 workers * 3 hours = 15 worker-hours. This is the total amount of work needed to build the wall.\n\nNow, if I have 15 workers, I need to find out how many hours it will take for them to complete the same amount of work, which is 15 worker-hours.\n\nLet's denote the time taken by 15 workers as T hours. Then, the total work done by 15 workers in T hours would be 15 workers * T hours.\n\nSince the total work required is 15 worker-hours, I can set up the equation:\n\n15 workers * T hours = 15 worker-hours.\n\nNow, solving for T:\n\nT = 15 worker-hours / 15 workers = 1 hour.\n\nSo, it should take 15 workers 1 hour to build the same wall.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If 5 workers take 3 hours, and 15 workers are three times as many, then logically, it should take one-third of the time, which is 1 hour. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of work rates. Each worker has a certain work rate, say R walls per hour. Then, the combined work rate of 5 workers is 5R, and they take 3 hours to build one wall. So, 5R * 3 hours = 1 wall, which means 15R = 1, so R = 1/15 walls per hour.\n\nNow, if I have 15 workers, their combined work rate is 15 * (1/15) = 1 wall per hour. Therefore, to build one wall, it will take them 1 hour.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If 5 workers take 3 hours, then to find out how long 15 workers take, I can use the concept of man-hours or worker-hours.\n\nTotal worker-hours required to build the wall is 5 workers * 3 hours = 15 worker-hours.\n\nIf I have 15 workers, the time T required would be the total worker-hours divided by the number of workers:\n\nT = 15 worker-hours / 15 workers = 1 hour.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Suppose I think about how much work each worker does per hour. Each worker completes 1/15 of the wall per hour, as we calculated earlier (since R = 1/15 walls per hour).\n\nSo, with 15 workers, they would complete 15 * (1/15) = 1 wall per hour. Hence, to build one wall, it would take them 1 hour.\n\nI think I've confirmed this from multiple angles, and all approaches lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, the answer should be 1 hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
