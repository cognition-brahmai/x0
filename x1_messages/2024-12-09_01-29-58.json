Bulls are actually colorblind to red and green; they see the world in shades of blue and yellow. Their charging behavior in bullfighting is likely a response to the movement of the matador's cape rather than its color. The myth persists because the traditional color of the cape used in bullfighting is red, but the bull would react similarly to any moving object, regardless of color."
