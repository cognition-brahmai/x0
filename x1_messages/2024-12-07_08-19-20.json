        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 50 feet long and 30 feet wide, and I need to figure out how much fencing is required to go around it. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst things first, I know that a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. So, the length is 50 feet, and the width is 30 feet. That means there are two sides that are 50 feet each and two sides that are 30 feet each.\n\nTo find out the total amount of fencing needed, I think I need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter is the total distance around the shape. For any polygon, it's just the sum of the lengths of all its sides.\n\nSo, for this rectangle, the perimeter P should be:\n\nP = 2 * length + 2 * width\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nP = 2 * 50 + 2 * 30\n\nLet me do the math here:\n\n2 times 50 is 100, and 2 times 30 is 60. So, 100 plus 60 equals 160.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter is 160 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle? I recall that sometimes there's a formula like P = 2 * (length + width). Let me check if that gives the same result.\n\nSo, P = 2 * (50 + 30) = 2 * 80 = 160 feet.\n\nOkay, same answer. Good, that makes sense.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider here? Is the garden on a slope or something? No, it's just a regular rectangular garden. So, I think the perimeter is straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check my calculations to be sure. Adding two lengths: 50 plus 50 is 100. Adding two widths: 30 plus 30 is 60. Total fencing needed: 100 plus 60 is 160 feet.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 2 times the sum of length and width: 2 times 80 is 160 feet.\n\nYep, seems consistent.\n\nI think 160 feet is the amount of fencing needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
