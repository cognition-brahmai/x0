        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing soccer and basketball. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 30 students in total. 18 play soccer, 12 play basketball, and 8 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, okay. I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. You know, where you add the number of students playing soccer and basketball, but since the students playing both are counted in both groups, I need to subtract them once to get the total number of students playing at least one sport.\n\nSo, the number of students playing at least one sport would be:\n\nNumber playing soccer + number playing basketball - number playing both.\n\nThat would be 18 + 12 - 8 = 22 students.\n\nThen, to find the number of students who don't play either sport, I subtract that number from the total number of students:\n\n30 - 22 = 8 students.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nI can also think about it using sets. Let's say set S is the set of students playing soccer, and set B is the set of students playing basketball.\n\nThe number of students playing at least one sport is |S \u222a B|, which is equal to |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B|.\n\nSo, |S| is 18, |B| is 12, and |S \u2229 B| is 8.\n\nSo, |S \u222a B| = 18 + 12 - 8 = 22.\n\nThen, the number of students not playing any sport is the total number of students minus those playing at least one sport, which is 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it using a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle has 18 students (soccer), the other has 12 (basketball), and the overlapping area has 8 students who play both.\n\nSo, the number of students who play only soccer would be 18 - 8 = 10.\n\nThe number of students who play only basketball would be 12 - 8 = 4.\n\nThen, the number of students who play at least one sport is 10 (only soccer) + 4 (only basketball) + 8 (both) = 22.\n\nAgain, 30 - 22 = 8 students who don't play either sport.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to look at it. What if some students play other sports not mentioned here? Oh, but the problem only mentions soccer and basketball, so I think we can assume that only these two sports are being considered.\n\nAlternatively, if there are students playing other sports, they wouldn't be included in the counts for soccer or basketball, so their numbers wouldn't affect the calculation for students not playing either of these two sports.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nLet me see if there's any other angle I should consider.\n\nIs there a chance that some students are being double-counted or something like that?\n\nWait, no. The inclusion-exclusion principle takes care of the double-counting for students playing both sports.\n\nSo, I think 8 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the total number of students involved in sports.\n\nOnly soccer: 10\n\nOnly basketball: 4\n\nBoth sports: 8\n\nTotal playing at least one sport: 10 + 4 + 8 = 22\n\nTotal students: 30\n\nStudents not playing any sport: 30 - 22 = 8\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I add the number of students playing soccer (18) and basketball (12), that's 30, but that includes the students playing both sports twice. So, I need to subtract the 8 students who play both to get the number of unique students playing at least one sport: 30 - 8 = 22.\n\nAgain, 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here.\n\nSo, the answer should be 8 students don't play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
