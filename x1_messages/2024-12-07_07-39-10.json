        "content": "Sure! Let's create a TypeScript class for a circle. A circle is a simple geometric shape, and we can define it with a radius. We'll include methods to calculate its area and circumference (which is the perimeter of a circle).\n\nFirst, make sure you have TypeScript installed. If not, you can install it using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g typescript\n```\n\nNow, let's create a file called `circle.ts` and define our Circle class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a TypeScript class representing a circle with methods for calculating area and circumference, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Circle Class:**\n   - Include a constructor that takes the radius as a parameter.\n   - Ensure the radius is a positive number.\n   - Implement methods to calculate the area and circumference.\n\n2. **Implement Error Handling:**\n   - Throw an error if the radius is not a positive number.\n\n3. **Provide Examples:**\n   - Show how to create instances of the Circle class and use its methods.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```typescript\nclass Circle {\n    private radius: number;\n\n    constructor(radius: number) {\n        if (radius <= 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Radius must be a positive number.\");\n        }\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n\n    area(): number {\n        return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;\n    }\n\n    circumference(): number {\n        return 2 * Math.PI * this.radius;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\ntry {\n    const circle = new Circle(5);\n    console.log(`Area: ${circle.area()}`);\n    console.log(`Circumference: ${circle.circumference()}`);\n} catch (error) {\n    console.error(error.message);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Class Definition:**\n   - The `Circle` class has a private property `radius` which is set via the constructor.\n   - The constructor checks if the provided radius is positive. If not, it throws an error.\n\n2. **Methods:**\n   - `area()`: Calculates the area of the circle using the formula \\( \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - `circumference()`: Calculates the circumference using the formula \\( 2\\pi r \\).\n\n3. **Example Usage:**\n   - Creates a new `Circle` instance with a radius of 5.\n   - Logs the area and circumference to the console.\n   - Handles any potential errors that may occur during instantiation."
