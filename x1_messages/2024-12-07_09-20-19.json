        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression given is (3^2 - 4) * (6 + 2) / 2. Okay, so first things first, I need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nStarting inside the parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate the exponent: 3^2. That's 3 squared, which is 9.\n\nSo, (9 - 4) * (6 + 2) / 2.\n\n2. Now, subtract inside the first parentheses: 9 - 4 equals 5.\n\nSo, it's now 5 * (6 + 2) / 2.\n\n3. Next, add inside the second parentheses: 6 + 2 equals 8.\n\nNow the expression is 5 * 8 / 2.\n\n4. Now, multiplication and division from left to right. First, multiply 5 by 8, which is 40.\n\nSo, 40 / 2.\n\n5. Finally, divide 40 by 2, which equals 20.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
