        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces widgets on different days, and we're given some relationships between the production amounts on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Specifically:\n\n- On Monday, it produces 10% more widgets than on Tuesday.\n\n- On Wednesday, it produces 20% fewer widgets than on Tuesday.\n\n- We're told that 180 widgets were produced on Tuesday.\n\nAnd the question is: How many percent more widgets are produced on Monday compared to Wednesday?\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what \"10% more on Monday than on Tuesday\" means. If Tuesday's production is 180 widgets, then Monday's production is 180 plus 10% of 180.\n\nSimilarly, \"20% fewer on Wednesday than on Tuesday\" means Wednesday's production is 180 minus 20% of 180.\n\nOnce we have the production numbers for Monday and Wednesday, we can find out how much more, in percentage terms, Monday's production is compared to Wednesday's.\n\nLet's start by calculating Monday's production.\n\nMonday's production = Tuesday's production + 10% of Tuesday's production\n\nGiven that Tuesday's production is 180 widgets:\n\nMonday's production = 180 + (10/100)*180 = 180 + 18 = 198 widgets\n\nNext, let's calculate Wednesday's production.\n\nWednesday's production = Tuesday's production - 20% of Tuesday's production\n\nWednesday's production = 180 - (20/100)*180 = 180 - 36 = 144 widgets\n\nNow, we need to find out how many percent more widgets are produced on Monday compared to Wednesday. In other words, we need to find the percentage increase from Wednesday to Monday.\n\nThe formula for percentage increase is:\n\nPercentage increase = [(Difference in production)/(Original amount)] * 100%\n\nIn this case, the \"original amount\" is Wednesday's production, and the \"difference\" is Monday's production minus Wednesday's production.\n\nSo:\n\nPercentage increase = [(Monday's production - Wednesday's production)/Wednesday's production] * 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage increase = [(198 - 144)/144] * 100% = (54/144) * 100%\n\nNow, let's simplify 54/144. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 18.\n\n54 \u00f7 18 = 3\n\n144 \u00f7 18 = 8\n\nSo, 54/144 = 3/8\n\nNow, 3/8 as a decimal is 0.375\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n0.375 * 100% = 37.5%\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 37.5% more widgets on Monday compared to Wednesday.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. I want to make sure I haven't made any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nFirst, confirming Monday's production:\n\n180 + (10% of 180) = 180 + 18 = 198 widgets. That seems correct.\n\nNext, Wednesday's production:\n\n180 - (20% of 180) = 180 - 36 = 144 widgets. That also seems correct.\n\nNow, the difference between Monday and Wednesday is 198 - 144 = 54 widgets.\n\nTo find out how many percent more Monday is compared to Wednesday, we take that difference, divide it by Wednesday's production, and then multiply by 100%.\n\nSo, (54 / 144) * 100% = (3/8) * 100% = 37.5%. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of ratios. If Wednesday's production is 144 widgets and Monday's is 198, then the ratio of Monday's production to Wednesday's is 198/144.\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n198 \u00f7 18 = 11\n\n144 \u00f7 18 = 8\n\nSo, 198/144 = 11/8 = 1.375\n\nThat means Monday's production is 1.375 times Wednesday's production, which is a 37.5% increase from Wednesday to Monday.\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 37.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37.5\\%} \\]"
