        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a person who saves 10% of their monthly salary for the first 5 years, and then increases their savings to 15% for the next 3 years. We need to find out what percentage of their total earnings over these 8 years they have saved.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the person's monthly salary remains constant over these 8 years. If the salary changes, the calculation would be more complex, but since no information about salary changes is provided, we'll assume it's constant.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the monthly salary as \"S.\"\n\nNow, the person saves 10% of S for 5 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 years would be 5 * 12 = 60 months.\n\nSo, the total amount saved in the first 5 years is:\n\n10% of S per month * 60 months = 0.10 * S * 60 = 6 * S\n\nNext, for the next 3 years, which is 3 * 12 = 36 months, the person saves 15% of S each month.\n\nSo, the total amount saved in the next 3 years is:\n\n15% of S per month * 36 months = 0.15 * S * 36 = 5.4 * S\n\nNow, the total amount saved over the 8 years is the sum of the two periods:\n\nTotal saved = 6 * S + 5.4 * S = 11.4 * S\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings over these 8 years.\n\nTotal earnings = Monthly salary * total number of months = S * (8 * 12) = S * 96\n\nNow, to find the percentage of total earnings that have been saved, we use the formula:\n\n(Total saved / Total earnings) * 100%\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n(11.4 * S) / (96 * S) * 100%\n\nThe \"S\" cancels out:\n\n(11.4) / (96) * 100%\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n11.4 / 96 = 0.11875\n\nNow, convert this to a percentage:\n\n0.11875 * 100% = 11.875%\n\nSo, the person has saved 11.875% of their total earnings over the 8 years.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express it as a fraction without the percentage sign, it would be 11.875%, but typically, percentages are used for such calculations.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check the calculations to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nFirst part: 10% for 5 years (60 months):\n\n0.10 * S * 60 = 6 * S\n\nSecond part: 15% for 3 years (36 months):\n\n0.15 * S * 36 = 5.4 * S\n\nTotal saved: 6 * S + 5.4 * S = 11.4 * S\n\nTotal earnings: S * 96\n\nPercentage saved: (11.4 * S) / (96 * S) * 100% = (11.4 / 96) * 100% = 11.875%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to calculate the weighted average of the savings rates over the total period.\n\nThe person saved at 10% for 5 years and 15% for 3 years.\n\nTotal years: 8 years\n\nBut since we're dealing with monthly savings, it's more accurate to calculate it based on the number of months, as done earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to calculate it yearly, we would need to consider the annual savings and total annual earnings, but since the salary is constant monthly, the monthly approach is straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is 11.875% of their total earnings over the 8 years have been saved.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.875\\%} \\]"
