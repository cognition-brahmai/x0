The expression is:\n\n((3^2 - 4) * 6 + 8) / 2\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting inside the innermost parentheses:\n\n3^2 - 4\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\nThen subtract 4:\n\n9 - 4 = 5\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(5 * 6 + 8) / 2\n\nNext, multiply 5 by 6:\n\n5 * 6 = 30\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(30 + 8) / 2\n\nAdd 30 and 8:\n\n30 + 8 = 38\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n38 / 2\n\nFinally, divide 38 by 2:\n\n38 / 2 = 19\n\nSo, the final answer is 19."
