        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 25 feet long and 15 feet wide, and I need to figure out how much fencing I'll need to go all the way around it.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. So, the lengths are both 25 feet, and the widths are both 15 feet. To find the total amount of fencing needed, I think I need to calculate the perimeter of the garden. The perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape.\n\nI recall that the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width. So, plugging in the values, it should be P = 2(25) + 2(15).\n\nLet me do the math here. 2 times 25 is 50, and 2 times 15 is 30. So, adding those together, 50 plus 30 equals 80. Therefore, the perimeter is 80 feet.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that I'm using the correct formula. Another way to think about it is that a rectangle has four sides, with opposite sides being equal. So, you could also think of it as adding all four sides together: 25 + 25 + 15 + 15, which also equals 80 feet.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. I think 80 feet is the correct amount of fencing needed.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, does the fence need to account for any gates or openings? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I probably don't need to add extra for that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the measurements are in the same units. The length and width are both given in feet, so no conversion is needed.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 80 feet of fencing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
