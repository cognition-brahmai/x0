        "content": "So Tom buys some packs of pencils and pens, and I need to find out the total number of writing instruments he has. Let me see.\n\nFirst, pencils are sold in packs of 4, and pens are sold in packs of 3. Tom buys 3 packs of pencils and 2 packs of pens.\n\nSo, for the pencils: 3 packs \u00d7 4 pencils per pack = 12 pencils.\n\nFor the pens: 2 packs \u00d7 3 pens per pack = 6 pens.\n\nNow, to find the total number of writing instruments, I just need to add the pencils and pens together: 12 pencils + 6 pens = 18 writing instruments.\n\nWait, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I can think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider the total number of packs first. Tom buys 3 packs of pencils and 2 packs of pens, so that's 3 + 2 = 5 packs in total.\n\nBut each pack contains a different number of items: pencils have 4 per pack, and pens have 3 per pack. So, I can't just multiply the total packs by one number.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as a combination of different packs. Maybe using the distributive property or something.\n\nLike, total writing instruments = (number of pencil packs \u00d7 pencils per pack) + (number of pen packs \u00d7 pens per pack).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (3 \u00d7 4) + (2 \u00d7 3) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Is there a more efficient way to calculate this, especially if he buys a large number of packs?\n\nWell, for small numbers like these, it's not necessary, but for larger numbers, maybe factoring or something could help.\n\nLet me try factoring: (3 \u00d7 4) + (2 \u00d7 3) = 3 \u00d7 4 + 2 \u00d7 3.\n\nI can factor out a 3: 3 \u00d7 (4 + 2) = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18.\n\nWait, does that always work? Let me check with different numbers.\n\nSuppose Tom buys 2 packs of pencils and 3 packs of pens.\n\nUsing the original method: (2 \u00d7 4) + (3 \u00d7 3) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nUsing the factoring method: 3 \u00d7 (4 + 2) = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18, which is different from 17.\n\nOh, so the factoring method only worked in the first case by coincidence. It's not a general method.\n\nTherefore, the reliable way is to calculate each type separately and then add them up.\n\nSo, in general, total writing instruments = (number of pencil packs \u00d7 pencils per pack) + (number of pen packs \u00d7 pens per pack).\n\nIn this specific problem, that gives us 12 pencils + 6 pens = 18 writing instruments.\n\nIs there any other aspect to consider here? Like, are there any constraints or additional information I should be aware of?\n\nThe problem seems straightforward. It doesn't mention anything about defective items or any items being missing from the packs. So, I can assume that each pack contains the stated number of items.\n\nAlso, it's clear that pencils and pens are both considered writing instruments, so adding them together makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me verify the calculations again.\n\n3 packs of pencils \u00d7 4 pencils per pack = 12 pencils.\n\n2 packs of pens \u00d7 3 pens per pack = 6 pens.\n\nTotal writing instruments = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The answer should be 18 writing instruments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
