It is a marine mammal that belongs to the suborder Mysticeti, which are baleen whales known for their filter-feeding system. Blue whales can reach lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) and weigh as much as 200 tons (180 metric tons). They feed almost exclusively on small shrimp-like creatures called krill, consuming several tons per day during the feeding season.Their enormous size and unique feeding mechanism make them one of the most fascinating animals on Earth.\n"
