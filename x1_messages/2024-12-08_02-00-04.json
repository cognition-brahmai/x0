        "content": "Let's tackle this age problem step by step. So, we have a father who is three times as old as his son right now. And in 15 years, the father will be twice as old as the son. I need to find out how old the father is currently.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to their current ages. Let's say the son's current age is S years, and the father's current age is F years.\n\nAccording to the first statement, the father is three times as old as his son. So, that gives me the equation:\n\nF = 3S\n\nNow, the second statement says that in 15 years, the father will be twice as old as his son. In 15 years, the son's age will be S + 15, and the father's age will be F + 15. And at that time, the father's age will be twice the son's age, so:\n\nF + 15 = 2(S + 15)\n\nAlright, now I have two equations:\n\n1) F = 3S\n\n2) F + 15 = 2(S + 15)\n\nI can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for S.\n\nSo, substituting F from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n3S + 15 = 2(S + 15)\n\nNow, I'll solve for S:\n\n3S + 15 = 2S + 30\n\nSubtract 2S from both sides:\n\n3S - 2S + 15 = 30\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nS + 15 = 30\n\nNow, subtract 15 from both sides:\n\nS = 30 - 15\n\nS = 15\n\nSo, the son is currently 15 years old.\n\nNow, to find the father's current age, I can use the first equation:\n\nF = 3S = 3 * 15 = 45\n\nTherefore, the father is currently 45 years old.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure this makes sense.\n\nIn 15 years, the son will be 15 + 15 = 30 years old, and the father will be 45 + 15 = 60 years old. Is the father twice as old as the son at that time? Well, twice 30 is 60, so yes, it checks out.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
