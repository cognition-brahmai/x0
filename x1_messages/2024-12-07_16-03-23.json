        "content": "So the factory originally produces 500 units of Product A per day. Then, because there's more demand, they decide to boost their production by 20%. I need to find out how many units they produce daily after this increase.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 20% increase means. Percentage increases are based on the original amount, right? So, 20% of 500 units will be added to the original production.\n\nTo calculate 20% of 500, I can multiply 500 by 20% or 0.20. Let me do that:\n\n500 units * 0.20 = 100 units.\n\nSo, the factory is increasing production by 100 units per day.\n\nNow, to find the total production after the increase, I add the increase to the original production:\n\n500 units + 100 units = 600 units.\n\nTherefore, after the 20% increase, the factory produces 600 units of Product A per day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Percentages can sometimes be tricky. Is there another way to calculate this?\n\nAnother approach is to think of the new production as 100% of the original plus the 20% increase. So, that's 120% of the original production.\n\nTo find 120% of 500 units, I can multiply 500 by 1.20.\n\n500 units * 1.20 = 600 units.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation. So, definitely, the factory now produces 600 units per day.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. The question seems straightforward. It doesn't mention any constraints like limited resources or production capacity, so I can assume that the factory can successfully increase its production by the specified percentage.\n\nAlso, the increase is applied to the daily production, and the question asks for the daily production after the increase, so I don't need to worry about weekly or monthly production rates.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll verify the calculations again.\n\nOriginal production: 500 units/day.\n\nIncrease: 20% of 500 = 100 units.\n\nNew production: 500 + 100 = 600 units/day.\n\nAlternatively, 120% of 500 = 600 units/day.\n\nBoth methods give the same result, which reinforces that my answer is correct.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The factory produces 600 units of Product A per day after the 20% increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]"
