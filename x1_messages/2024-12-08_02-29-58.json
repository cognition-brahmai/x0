        "content": "So I've got this math problem here: (4^2 - 3) * (5 + 2)^2. Hmm, let's see how to tackle this. I remember that in math problems with parentheses and exponents, I need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, I'll handle what's inside the parentheses. There are two sets here: (4^2 - 3) and (5 + 2). I'll start with the first one: (4^2 - 3). Inside here, I have an exponent and a subtraction. According to PEMDAS, exponents come before subtraction, so I'll calculate 4^2 first.\n\n4^2 means 4 multiplied by itself, which is 16. So, 4^2 - 3 becomes 16 - 3, which equals 13. So, the first part simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving on to the second set of parentheses: (5 + 2). That's straightforward; 5 plus 2 is 7.\n\nSo now, the expression has simplified to 13 * 7^2. Next, I need to handle the exponent here: 7^2. That's 7 multiplied by itself, which is 49.\n\nNow, the expression is 13 * 49. To find the product of 13 and 49, I can break it down. I know that 13 * 50 is 650, and since 49 is one less than 50, I can subtract 13 from 650 to get the result.\n\nSo, 650 - 13 is 637.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 637.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Let me recast the original expression step by step.\n\nOriginal expression: (4^2 - 3) * (5 + 2)^2\n\nFirst, calculate the exponents:\n\n4^2 is 16, and (5 + 2)^2 is 7^2, which is 49.\n\nSo, (16 - 3) * 49\n\nThen, 16 - 3 is 13.\n\nSo, 13 * 49.\n\nNow, to multiply 13 by 49, I can think of it as 13 * (50 - 1), which is 13*50 - 13*1 = 650 - 13 = 637.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply 13*40 and 13*9, then add them together: (13*40) + (13*9) = 520 + 117 = 637.\n\nYes, both methods give me the same answer, 637.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{637} \\]"
