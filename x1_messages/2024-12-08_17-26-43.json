        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a bag of marbles with different colors: 4 red, 6 blue, and 10 green. I need to find out the probability of picking a red marble at random. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and in this case, it's the chance of picking a red marble.\n\nFirst, I should remember the formula for probability. I think it's the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this scenario, the favorable outcome is picking a red marble, and the total outcomes are all the marbles in the bag.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red marbles, which is 4. And the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of marbles in the bag. To find that, I need to add up all the marbles: 4 red + 6 blue + 10 green.\n\nLet me do that addition: 4 + 6 is 10, and then 10 + 10 is 20. So, there are 20 marbles in total.\n\nNow, plugging these numbers into the probability formula: probability of picking a red marble is 4 (red marbles) divided by 20 (total marbles). So, that's 4/20.\n\nI can simplify that fraction. Both 4 and 20 can be divided by 4. 4 divided by 4 is 1, and 20 divided by 4 is 5. So, the simplified fraction is 1/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this probability as a decimal or a percentage. To convert 1/5 to a decimal, I divide 1 by 5, which is 0.2. To get the percentage, I multiply that by 100, so 0.2 times 100 is 20%.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red marble is 1/5, or 0.2, or 20%. All of these mean the same thing, just different ways of expressing the probability.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of marbles is indeed 4 + 6 + 10 = 20. And the number of red marbles is 4. So, 4 out of 20 is correctly simplified to 1/5. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Is there any other factor that could affect the probability, like whether the marbles are being picked with or without replacement? In this problem, it says \"randomly picking a red marble from the bag,\" and it doesn't mention anything about replacement, so I think it's a single pick, and the marbles are well-mixed or something like that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I haven't miscounted the marbles or misread the numbers. The problem says 4 red, 6 blue, and 10 green. Yeah, that adds up to 20.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the proportion of each color in the bag. Red marbles make up 4 out of 20 marbles, which is indeed 1/5 or 20%. So, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The probability of picking a red marble is 1/5, or 0.2, or 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}} \\]"
