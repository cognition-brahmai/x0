        "content": "So, let's see. There are 1200 students in total at the school. 60% of them participate in sports activities, and 40% participate in arts activities. There's an overlap of 20%, meaning that some students are involved in both sports and arts. I need to find out how many students are involved in both.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many students participate in sports and how many participate in arts.\n\nFor sports:\n\n60% of 1200 students = 0.60 \u00d7 1200 = 720 students\n\nFor arts:\n\n40% of 1200 students = 0.40 \u00d7 1200 = 480 students\n\nNow, there's an overlap of 20%. I need to understand what this 20% represents. Does this 20% refer to the total number of students who participate in both activities, or is it the percentage of students involved in both activities relative to those involved in sports or arts?\n\nWait, the question says, \"there is an overlap of 20%.\" I think this means that 20% of the students are involved in both sports and arts.\n\nSo, 20% of 1200 students = 0.20 \u00d7 1200 = 240 students\n\nTherefore, 240 students are involved in both sports and arts activities.\n\nBut let me double-check this interpretation. Sometimes, in such problems, the overlap might refer to the percentage of students in sports who also do arts, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the overlap is the percentage of students who are in both activities relative to the total number of students involved in either activity.\n\nWait, the question seems to specify that there is an overlap of 20%, but it doesn't clearly state what this 20% is referring to. To avoid confusion, maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students involved in both activities.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that:\n\nTotal number of students involved in sports or arts = number in sports + number in arts - number in both\n\nLet's denote:\n\nS = number of students in sports = 720\n\nA = number of students in arts = 480\n\nB = number of students in both sports and arts\n\nThen, the total number of students involved in either sports or arts or both is S + A - B.\n\nBut the total number of students is 1200. However, not all students may be involved in either sports or arts. The question doesn't specify that every student is involved in at least one of the two activities.\n\nWait, actually, the question says that 60% participate in sports and 40% in arts, with an overlap of 20%. It seems like the overlap is directly given as 20% of the total students.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial approach is correct: 20% of 1200 students are involved in both sports and arts, which is 240 students.\n\nAlternatively, if the overlap percentage is meant to be interpreted differently, say as the percentage of students in sports who also do arts, then it would be 20% of the sports participants.\n\nBut the question says \"there is an overlap of 20%,\" which seems to refer to the total student body.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps I should consider that the overlap is 20% of the total students, meaning 240 students are involved in both sports and arts.\n\nSo, the answer would be 240 students are involved in both sports and arts activities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
