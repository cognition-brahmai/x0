        "content": "Sure! To calculate the area of a circle, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. Given that the diameter is 14 cm, the radius \\( r \\) would be half of that, which is 7 cm.\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 7^2 = \\pi \\times 49 \\]\n\nNow, the value of \\( \\pi \\) (pi) is approximately 3.14159. Therefore:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} \\approx 3.14159 \\times 49 \\approx 153.938 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\]\n\nSo, the area of the circle is approximately 153.94 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{153.94 \\, \\text{cm}^2} \\]"
