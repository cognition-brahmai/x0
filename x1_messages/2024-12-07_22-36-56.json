        "content": "I'd be happy to help you solve that system of equations. So, we have two equations here:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x - y = 1 \\)\n\nOur goal is to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy both equations at the same time. There are a few methods to solve systems of equations, but I'll show you one that's straightforward and commonly used: the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's look at the two equations again:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x - y = 1 \\)\n\nNotice that in the first equation, we have \\( y \\), and in the second equation, we have \\( -y \\). That's pretty convenient because if we add these two equations together, the \\( y \\) terms will cancel each other out. Let's try that.\n\nAdding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n\\( (x + y) + (2x - y) = 5 + 1 \\)\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\( x + y + 2x - y = 3x + 0y = 3x \\)\n\nAnd the right side:\n\n\\( 5 + 1 = 6 \\)\n\nSo, we end up with:\n\n\\( 3x = 6 \\)\n\nNow, to find \\( x \\), we just need to divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\)\n\nGreat, we have \\( x = 2 \\). Now, we need to find the corresponding value of \\( y \\). To do that, we can plug the value of \\( x \\) back into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation because it's simpler:\n\n\\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\( 2 + y = 5 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 2 from both sides to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( y = 5 - 2 = 3 \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = 3 \\).\n\nTo make sure our solution is correct, it's always a good idea to check both values in both equations.\n\nFirst, plug \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\) into equation 1:\n\n\\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\), which matches the equation.\n\nSecond, plug them into equation 2:\n\n\\( 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1 \\), which also matches.\n\nPerfect, everything checks out.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(2, 3)} \\]"
