        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to write a Golang application that calculates the factorial of a number using goroutines. The number comes from the command line, and I need to show how long it takes to compute. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I get all parts right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a factorial is. Factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5 factorial is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Simple enough.\n\nNow, using goroutines for this. Goroutines are Go's way of handling concurrency. They're\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u7ebf\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002But for calculating factorial, which is a sequential operation, using goroutines might not be the most efficient way, but it's a good exercise to learn how to use them.\n\nI need to think about how to break down the factorial calculation into smaller tasks that can be executed concurrently. One way is to split the range of numbers into smaller chunks and have each goroutine compute the product of its chunk, then multiply all the chunk results together.\n\nFor example, if I have to calculate 10!, I could split it into two chunks: one goroutine calculates 10*9*8*7*6, and another calculates 5*4*3*2*1, then multiply the two results together. But I'm not sure if this is the best way. Maybe I should have each goroutine handle multiplying one number.\n\nWait, but that might be overkill. Multiplying two numbers is a fast operation, so spawning a goroutine for each multiplication might not be efficient because the overhead of creating goroutines could outweigh the benefits.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to have multiple goroutines each handling a part of the multiplication sequence, and then combine their results. Let's say for 10!, I could have two goroutines: one handling 10*9*8*7*6 and another handling 5*4*3*2*1, then multiply the two results.\n\nI need to consider how to handle the multiplication of large numbers because factorials grow very quickly. In Go, integers have a fixed size, so for large factorials, I might need to use the math/big package, which provides arbitrary-precision integers.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the program reads the number from the command line. In Go, I can use the os package to access command-line arguments.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to follow:\n\n1. Read the command-line argument and parse it into an integer.\n\n2. Check if the input is a valid non-negative integer.\n\n3. If valid, proceed to calculate the factorial using goroutines.\n\n4. Measure the time taken to perform the calculation.\n\n5. Print the result and the time taken.\n\nI need to think about how to structure the goroutines. Maybe I can create a channel to collect the partial products from each goroutine, then multiply them all together.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose the input is 6.\n\n- Total tasks: 6 (for 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\n\n- I can create, say, 3 goroutines, each handling two multiplications.\n\n- Goroutine 1: 6 * 5 = 30\n\n- Goroutine 2: 4 * 3 = 12\n\n- Goroutine 3: 2 * 1 = 2\n\n- Then, multiply 30 * 12 * 2 = 720, which is 6!\n\nWait, but in this case, it's still sequential because multiplying the partial products together still needs to be done in sequence.\n\nMaybe I should have each goroutine handle a part of the sequence and pass the result to the next goroutine in a pipeline.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Goroutine 1: multiplies 6 * 5 and sends to Goroutine 2\n\n- Goroutine 2: receives from Goroutine 1, multiplies by 4, and sends to Goroutine 3\n\n- Goroutine 3: receives from Goroutine 2, multiplies by 3, and so on.\n\nBut that seems more complicated and might not offer any performance benefit.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a wait group to wait for all goroutines to finish their computations before multiplying the partial products.\n\nI think the best approach is to split the range into equal parts, have each goroutine compute the product of its part, then collect all partial products and multiply them together in the main routine.\n\nLet me try to write some pseudocode:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\n\t\"fmt\"\n\n\t\"os\"\n\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"runtime\"\n\n\t\"sync\"\n\n\t\"math/big\"\n\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n\tif len(os.Args) != 2 {\n\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Usage: go run factorial.go <number>\")\n\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\n\t}\n\n\tnStr := os.Args[1]\n\n\tn, err := strconv.Atoi(nStr)\n\n\tif err != nil || n < 0 {\n\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Please enter a non-negative integer.\")\n\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\n\t}\n\n\tstartTime := time.Now()\n\n\tnumGoroutines := runtime.NumCPU()\n\n\tchunkSize := n / numGoroutines\n\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\n.partialProducts := make(chan *big.Int, numGoroutines)\n\nfor i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\n\tstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\n\tend := start - chunkSize\n\n\tif end < 1 {\n\n\t\tend = 1\n\n\t}\n\n\twg.Add(1)\n\n\tgo func(start, end int) {\n\n\t\tdefer wg.Done()\n\n\t\tproduct := big.NewInt(1)\n\n\t\tfor j := start; j >= end; j-- {\n\n\t\t\tproduct.Mul(product, big.NewInt(int64(j)))\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpartialProducts <- product\n\n\t}(start, end)\n\n}\n\ngo func() {\n\n\twg.Wait()\n\n\tclose(partialProducts)\n\n}()\n\ntotalProduct := big.NewInt(1)\n\n\tfor pp := range partialProducts {\n\n\t\ttotalProduct.Mul(totalProduct, pp)\n\n\t}\n\n.elapsedTime := time.Since(startTime)\n\nfmt.Printf(\"%d! = %s\\n\", n, totalProduct.String())\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Time taken: %s\\n\", elapsedTime)\n\n}\n\nThis seems like a plan. I need to handle the case where the number of CPUs doesn't divide the number evenly, but I think this should work.\n\nI should also handle the case where the input number is small, smaller than the number of goroutines. In that case, I might not need that many goroutines.\n\nMaybe I can adjust the number of goroutines based on the input number. For example, if n is less than the number of CPUs, set numGoroutines to n.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that each goroutine gets at least one multiplication to do, otherwise, I might have idle goroutines.\n\nLet me think about that. If n is 5 and numGoroutines is 3, then:\n\n- Goroutine 1: 5 * 4 (start=5, end=4)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 3 (start=3, end=3)\n\n- Goroutine 3: 2 * 1 (start=2, end=1)\n\nThat seems fair.\n\nI need to make sure that the chunks are assigned correctly. In the code above, I have:\n\nstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\nend := start - chunkSize\n\nif end < 1 {\n\nend = 1\n\n}\n\nBut with n=5, numGoroutines=3, chunkSize=1 (5/3=1), this would assign:\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=5, end=4\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=4, end=3\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=3, end=2\n\nBut then goroutine 2 would multiply 3 * 2, which is fine, but goroutine 1 would multiply 4 * 3, which is already handled by goroutine 2. There's an overlap.\n\nWait, this is not correct. I need to adjust the chunk assignment.\n\nMaybe I should assign the ranges in a way that there's no overlap.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nAssume n=5, numGoroutines=3.\n\n- Goroutine 0: 5 * 4 (start=5, end=4)\n\n- Goroutine 1: 3 * 2 (start=3, end=2)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 1 (start=1, end=1)\n\nBut in this case, goroutine 0 handles 5 and 4, goroutine 1 handles 3 and 2, and goroutine 2 handles 1.\n\nThen, in the main function, I multiply the results from these goroutines.\n\nWait, but in this setup, goroutine 0 would compute 5 * 4 = 20, goroutine 1 would compute 3 * 2 = 6, and goroutine 2 would compute 1. Then, in the main function, I would compute 20 * 6 * 1 = 120, which is correct.\n\nSeems okay.\n\nBut I need a general way to assign start and end for each goroutine.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate start and end for each goroutine.\n\nIf n=10 and numGoroutines=3, then:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 10 to 8 (start=10, end=8)\n\n- Goroutine 1: 7 to 5 (start=7, end=5)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 4 to 1 (start=4, end=1)\n\nBut 10 to 8 is 10 * 9 * 8, which is incorrect; it should be 10 * 9 * 8.\n\nWait, no. In factorial, it's sequential: 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n\nIf I split it into 3 goroutines, I need to divide the sequence into 3 parts.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to divide the sequence into numGoroutines parts, each handling a portion of the sequence.\n\nFor example, for n=10 and numGoroutines=3:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 (numbers 10 to 7)\n\n- Goroutine 1: 6 * 5 * 4 (numbers 6 to 4)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 3 * 2 * 1 (numbers 3 to 1)\n\nThen, in the main function, multiply the results from these goroutines.\n\nIn this case, goroutine 0 computes 10 * 9 * 8 * 7, goroutine 1 computes 6 * 5 * 4, and goroutine 2 computes 3 * 2 * 1. Finally, multiply these three results together.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nTo generalize, for n and numGoroutines, I can calculate the chunk size as n / numGoroutines, and the remainder as n % numGoroutines.\n\nThen, distribute the remainder among the first few goroutines.\n\nFor example, with n=10 and numGoroutines=3:\n\n- chunkSize = 10 / 3 = 3\n\n- remainder = 10 % 3 = 1\n\nSo, the first goroutine gets an extra number.\n\n- Goroutine 0: 10 to 8 (10, 9, 8)\n\n- Goroutine 1: 7 to 5 (7, 6, 5)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 4 to 1 (4, 3, 2, 1)\n\nWait, but this is different from my earlier division.\n\nI need a consistent way to assign the ranges.\n\nMaybe it's easier to assign the ranges in reverse order, starting from n down to 1.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor n=10 and numGoroutines=3:\n\n- Determine the chunk size: 10 / 3 = 3 with remainder 1\n\n- Assign the first goroutine 4 numbers (3 + 1), starting from 10 down to 7\n\n- Assign the second goroutine 3 numbers: 6 down to 4\n\n- Assign the third goroutine 3 numbers: 3 down to 1\n\nYes, that seems better.\n\nSo, in code, I can do something like:\n\nchunkSize := n / numGoroutines\n\nextra := n % numGoroutines\n\nThen, for each goroutine:\n\nfor i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\nstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\nif i < extra {\n\nstart += 1\n\n}\n\nend := start - chunkSize\n\nif end < 1 {\n\nend = 1\n\n}\n\n// assign this goroutine to multiply from start down to end\n\n}\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the ranges don't overlap and cover the entire sequence.\n\nLet me test this with n=10, numGoroutines=3:\n\nchunkSize = 3, extra=1\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=10, end=10-3=7\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=7-3=4\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=4-3=1\n\nBut this would be:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 10 to 7 (10,9,8,7)\n\n- Goroutine 1: 4 to 1 (4,3,2,1)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 1 to 1 (1)\n\nWait, that's not right because it's missing 6,5.\n\nI need to adjust the starting points.\n\nLet me try starting from n and decrementing by chunkSize for each goroutine.\n\nFor n=10, numGoroutines=3:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 10 down to 8 (10,9,8)\n\n- Goroutine 1: 7 down to 5 (7,6,5)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 4 down to 1 (4,3,2,1)\n\nYes, that covers all numbers from 10 to 1.\n\nIn code, I can do:\n\nfor i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\nstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\nif i < extra {\n\nstart += 1\n\n}\n\nend := start - chunkSize\n\nif end < 1 {\n\nend = 1\n\n}\n\n// assign goroutine to multiply from start down to end+1\n\n}\n\nWait, in Go, the big.Int Mul function is product.Mul(product, big.NewInt(int64(j))), so it's multiplicative.\n\nI need to make sure that each goroutine multiplies all the numbers in its range, in descending order.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the partial products are collected correctly and multiplied in the main function.\n\nI should also consider the case when n is 0 or 1, where 0! = 1 and 1! = 1.\n\nAdditionally, for large n, the factorial can be extremely large, so using math/big is necessary to handle big integers.\n\nI should also measure the time taken for the calculation, excluding the time to parse the command line and set up the environment.\n\nMaybe I should record the start time before spawning the goroutines and record the end time after all partial products are multiplied.\n\nLet me think about error handling. If the input is not a number or is negative, I should handle that gracefully.\n\nAlso, if the number of goroutines is larger than n, I need to adjust so that each goroutine handles at least one number.\n\nFor example, if n=5 and numGoroutines=10, I can still proceed by assigning some goroutines to multiply 1, which doesn't affect the product.\n\nBut it's inefficient, so maybe I should set numGoroutines to be at most n.\n\nAlternatively, I can set numGoroutines to be the minimum of n and runtime.NumCPU().\n\nWait, but runtime.NumCPU() gives the number of logical CPUs, which might not be the best choice for this specific task.\n\nI need to think about the optimal number of goroutines for this kind of computation.\n\nSince multiplying integers is a CPU-bound task, using multiple goroutines might not lead to a significant speedup due to the Global Interpreter Lock or context switching overhead.\n\nBut for the sake of the exercise, I'll proceed with using multiple goroutines.\n\nLet me try to write some code based on this plan.\n\nFirst, import the necessary packages:\n\nimport (\n\n\t\"fmt\"\n\n\t\"os\"\n\n\t\"runtime\"\n\n\t\"strconv\"\n\n\t\"sync\"\n\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"math/big\"\n\n)\n\nThen, in the main function:\n\nfunc main() {\n\n\tif len(os.Args) != 2 {\n\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Usage: go run factorial.go <number>\")\n\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\n\t}\n\n\tnStr := os.Args[1]\n\n\tn, err := strconv.Atoi(nStr)\n\n\tif err != nil || n < 0 {\n\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Please enter a non-negative integer.\")\n\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\n\t}\n\n\tstartTime := time.Now()\n\n\tnumGoroutines := runtime.NumCPU()\n\n\tif numGoroutines > n {\n\n\t\tnumGoroutines = n\n\n\t}\n\n\tchunkSize := n / numGoroutines\n\n\textra := n % numGoroutines\n\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\n\tpartialProducts := make(chan *big.Int, numGoroutines)\n\n\tfor i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\n\t\tstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\n\t\tif i < extra {\n\n\t\t\tstart += 1\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tend := start - chunkSize\n\n\t\tif end < 1 {\n\n\t\t\tend = 1\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\twg.Add(1)\n\n\t\tgo func(start, end int) {\n\n\t\t\tdefer wg.Done()\n\n\t\t\tproduct := big.NewInt(1)\n\n\t\t\tfor j := start; j >= end; j-- {\n\n\t\t\t\tproduct.Mul(product, big.NewInt(int64(j)))\n\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tpartialProducts <- product\n\n\t\t}(start, end)\n\n\t}\n\n\tgo func() {\n\n\t\twg.Wait()\n\n\t\tclose(partialProducts)\n\n\t}()\n\n\ttotalProduct := big.NewInt(1)\n\n\tfor pp := range partialProducts {\n\n\t\ttotalProduct.Mul(totalProduct, pp)\n\n\t}\n\n.elapsedTime := time.Since(startTime)\n\nfmt.Printf(\"%d! = %s\\n\", n, totalProduct.String())\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Time taken: %s\\n\", elapsedTime)\n\n}\n\nThis seems like it should work. Let's test it with n=5.\n\nn=5, numGoroutines=runtime.NumCPU(), assume NumCPU()=4.\n\nchunkSize=5/4=1, extra=5%4=1\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=5+1=6 (but n=5, so start=5), end=5-1=4\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=5-1*1=4, end=4-1=3\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=5-2*1=3, end=3-1=2\n\n- Goroutine 3: start=5-3*1=2, end=2-1=1\n\nSo, the ranges are:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 5 down to 4 (5,4)\n\n- Goroutine 1: 4 down to 3 (4,3)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 3 down to 2 (3,2)\n\n- Goroutine 3: 2 down to 1 (2,1)\n\nWait, but goroutine 0 is handling 5 and 4, but goroutine 1 is also handling 4 and 3, which means 4 is being multiplied twice.\n\nThis is a mistake in the range assignment.\n\nI need to adjust the start and end values so that there's no overlap.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nMaybe I should assign the ranges sequentially.\n\nFor n=5 and numGoroutines=4:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 5\n\n- Goroutine 1: 4\n\n- Goroutine 2: 3\n\n- Goroutine 3: 2*1\n\nThen, in the main function, multiply all these partial products together.\n\nThis way, there's no overlap, and all numbers are covered.\n\nIn general, for n and numGoroutines, I can assign each goroutine a unique set of numbers to multiply.\n\nFor example, with n=10 and numGoroutines=3:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 10*9*8\n\n- Goroutine 1: 7*6*5\n\n- Goroutine 2: 4*3*2*1\n\nThis avoids overlap and covers the entire sequence.\n\nIn code, I can calculate the start and end for each goroutine based on their index.\n\nLet me try to implement this.\n\nDefine chunkSize := n / numGoroutines\n\nextra := n % numGoroutines\n\nThen, for each goroutine:\n\nfor i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\n\tstart := n - (i * chunkSize)\n\n\tif i < extra {\n\n\t\tstart += 1\n\n\t}\n\n\tend := start - chunkSize\n\n\tif end < 1 {\n\n\t\tend = 1\n\n\t}\n\n\t// assign goroutine to multiply from start down to end\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the earlier example with n=5 and numGoroutines=4:\n\nchunkSize=1, extra=1\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=5+1=6 (but n=5), end=6-1=5\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=5-1=4, end=4-1=3\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=5-2=3, end=3-1=2\n\n- Goroutine 3: start=5-3=2, end=2-1=1\n\nThis still has overlapping ranges.\n\nI need to rethink this.\n\nMaybe I should assign the ranges sequentially from the highest number down.\n\nFor n=5 and numGoroutines=4:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 5\n\n- Goroutine 1: 4\n\n- Goroutine 2: 3\n\n- Goroutine 3: 2*1\n\nIn this case, the start and end for each goroutine would be:\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=5, end=5\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=4, end=4\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=3, end=3\n\n- Goroutine 3: start=2, end=1\n\nThis way, there's no overlap.\n\nIn general, I can assign:\n\nfor i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\n\tstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\n\tif i < extra {\n\n\t\tstart += 1\n\n\t}\n\n\tend := start - chunkSize\n\n\tif end < 1 {\n\n\t\tend = 1\n\n\t}\n\n\t// assign goroutine to multiply from start down to end\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the n=5, numGoroutines=4 example:\n\nchunkSize=1, extra=1\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=5+1=6 (invalid, since n=5), end=6-1=5\n\nThis doesn't make sense.\n\nI need a better way to assign start and end.\n\nPerhaps I should iterate from 0 to numGoroutines-1, and assign the start and end accordingly.\n\nLet me try to write a function to calculate the start and end for each goroutine.\n\nfunc getStartEnd(n, numGoroutines, i, chunkSize, extra int) (start, end int) {\n\n\tstart = n - i*chunkSize\n\n\tif i < extra {\n\n\t\tstart += 1\n\n\t}\n\n\tend = start - chunkSize\n\n\tif end < 1 {\n\n\t\tend = 1\n\n\t}\n\n\treturn\n\n}\n\nBut as seen earlier, this leads to overlapping or invalid ranges.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can divide the sequence into numGoroutines parts, each of size chunkSize, and handle the extra numbers separately.\n\nFor example, with n=10 and numGoroutines=3:\n\n- chunkSize=3, extra=1\n\n- Assign the extra to the first goroutine:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 10,9,8,7\n\n- Goroutine 1: 6,5,4\n\n- Goroutine 2: 3,2,1\n\nThis way, goroutine 0 handles the extra number.\n\nIn code, it would be:\n\nfor i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\n\tstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\n\tif i < extra {\n\n\t\tstart += 1\n\n\t}\n\n\tend := start - chunkSize\n\n\tif end < 1 {\n\n\t\tend = 1\n\n\t}\n\n\t// assign goroutine to multiply from start down to end\n\n}\n\nWait, with n=10, numGoroutines=3, chunkSize=3, extra=1:\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=10+1=11 (invalid), end=11-3=8\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=10-3=7, end=7-3=4\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=7-3=4, end=4-3=1\n\nThis still has overlapping ranges.\n\nI need to fix the start calculation.\n\nLet me try:\n\nfor i := 0;

i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\n\tstartIndex := i * tasksPerGoroutine + 1 + min(i, extra)\n\n\tendIndex := startIndex + tasksPerGoroutine - 1\n\n\tif i < extra {\n\n\t\tendIndex++\n\n\t}\n\n\tif endIndex > n {\n\n\t\tendIndex = n\n\n\t}\n\n\tstart := n - endIndex + 1\n\n\tend := n - startIndex + 1\n\n\t// assign goroutine to multiply from start down to end\n\n}\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should iterate backward and assign ranges accordingly.\n\nLet me try with n=5 and numGoroutines=3:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 5,4\n\n- Goroutine 1: 3,2\n\n- Goroutine 2: 1\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=5, end=4\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=3, end=2\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=1, end=1\n\nThis covers all numbers without overlap.\n\nIn general, I can calculate the chunk size as (n + numGoroutines - 1) / numGoroutines, which is the ceiling of n/numGoroutines.\n\nThen, for each goroutine, assign a consecutive chunk of numbers to multiply.\n\nWait, in Go, there's no direct way to do ceiling division, but I can calculate chunkSize := (n + numGoroutines - 1) / numGoroutines\n\nThen, for each goroutine i:\n\n\tstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\n\tend := start - chunkSize + 1\n\n\tif end < 1 {\n\n\t\tend = 1\n\n\t}\n\n\t// assign goroutine to multiply from start down to end\n\n}\n\nLet's test this with n=5, numGoroutines=3:\n\nchunkSize = (5 + 3 - 1) / 3 = 5 / 3 = 1 (in integer division)\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=5 - 0*1=5, end=5 -1 +1=5\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=5 -1*1=4, end=4-1+1=4\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=5 -2*1=3, end=3-1+1=3\n\nThis assigns:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 5\n\n- Goroutine 1: 4\n\n- Goroutine 2: 3\n\nBut this misses 2 and 1.\n\nWait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the chunkSize.\n\nchunkSize := (n + numGoroutines -1) / numGoroutines\n\nFor n=5, numGoroutines=3:\n\nchunkSize = (5 + 3 -1)/3 = 7/3=2\n\nThen:\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=5 -0*2=5, end=5-2+1=4\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=5 -1*2=3, end=3-2+1=2\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=5 -2*2=1, end=1-2+1=0 -> since end <1, end=1\n\nSo, the ranges are:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 5 down to 4 (5,4)\n\n- Goroutine 1: 3 down to 2 (3,2)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 1 down to 1 (1)\n\nThis covers all numbers from 5 to 1 without overlap.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nLet's confirm with n=10, numGoroutines=3:\n\nchunkSize=(10+3-1)/3=12/3=4\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=10-0*4=10, end=10-4+1=7\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=10-4=6, end=6-4+1=3\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=10-8=2, end=2-4+1=-1 -> since end <1, end=1\n\nSo, the ranges are:\n\n- Goroutine 0: 10 down to 7 (10,9,8,7)\n\n- Goroutine 1: 6 down to 3 (6,5,4,3)\n\n- Goroutine 2: 2 down to 1 (2,1)\n\nThis also covers all numbers from 10 to 1 without overlap.\n\nGreat, this seems to be a consistent way to assign the ranges.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nchunkSize := (n + numGoroutines -1) / numGoroutines\n\nfor i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\n\tstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\n\tend := start - chunkSize + 1\n\n\tif end < 1 {\n\n\t\tend = 1\n\n\t}\n\n\t// assign goroutine to multiply from start down to end\n\n}\n\nThis should work for various values of n and numGoroutines.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that in the goroutine function, it multiplies from start down to end inclusive.\n\nAlso, I need to collect all partial products and multiply them in the main function.\n\nI should also consider that if numGoroutines >= n, then each goroutine handles at most one number, which is fine.\n\nFor example, n=5, numGoroutines=5:\n\nchunkSize=(5+5-1)/5=9/5=1\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=5-0*1=5, end=5-1+1=5 -> multiply 5\n\n- Goroutine 1: start=5-1=4, end=4-1+1=4 -> multiply 4\n\n- Goroutine 2: start=5-2=3, end=3-1+1=3 -> multiply 3\n\n- Goroutine 3: start=5-3=2, end=2-1+1=2 -> multiply 2\n\n- Goroutine 4: start=5-4=1, end=1-1+1=1 -> multiply 1\n\nThis is correct.\n\nAlso, for n=1, numGoroutines=1:\n\nchunkSize=(1+1-1)/1=1/1=1\n\n- Goroutine 0: start=1-0*1=1, end=1-1+1=1 -> multiply 1\n\nCorrect.\n\nFor n=0, but 0! is defined as 1, so I need to handle that separately.\n\nIn the code, if n=0, I can directly set totalProduct to 1 without spawning any goroutines.\n\nBut according to the problem, the number is provided as a command-line argument and should be a non-negative integer, so I need to handle n=0 as a special case.\n\nIn the main function, before spawning goroutines, I can check if n==0, set totalProduct to 1, and skip the goroutine part.\n\nSimilarly, for n=1, I can set totalProduct to 1 as well, but spawning goroutines for n=1 is also fine.\n\nTo optimize, I can set numGoroutines to 1 if n <=1.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the channel is closed after all goroutines have finished to prevent the main function from blocking indefinitely.\n\nI can use a wait group to wait for all goroutines to finish before closing the channel.\n\nIn the code, I have:\n\ngo func() {\n\n\twg.Wait()\n\n\tclose(partialProducts)\n\n}()\n\nThis should ensure that the channel is closed after all goroutines have finished sending their partial products.\n\nThen, in the main function, I can range over the partialProducts channel and multiply them together.\n\nFinally, print the result and the time taken.\n\nI should also consider the time taken to set up the goroutines and the channel. To get a more accurate measurement, maybe I should start the timer before spawning the goroutines and stop it after all partial products are multiplied.\n\nYes, that's what I have in the code.\n\nLet me write the complete code based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Golang application that calculates the factorial of a given number using goroutines, follow the steps below. This solution ensures that the calculation is performed concurrently and measures the time taken to compute the factorial.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Read and Validate Input:**\n   - Read the number from the command line.\n   - Validate that the input is a non-negative integer.\n\n2. **Special Cases:**\n   - If `n` is 0 or 1, directly set the factorial to 1 since 0! = 1! = 1.\n\n3. **Determine Number of Goroutines:**\n   - Use the number of available CPUs for goroutines to maximize parallelism.\n   - Adjust the number of goroutines based on the input number `n`.\n\n4. **Divide Work:**\n   - Split the multiplication tasks into chunks assigned to each goroutine.\n   - Each goroutine computes the product of its assigned chunk of the sequence.\n\n5. **Collect Results:**\n   - Use a channel to collect partial products from each goroutine.\n   - Multiply these partial products to get the final factorial.\n\n6. **Measure Time:**\n   - Record the start time before computations begin and the end time after all multiplications are completed.\n   - Display the time taken for the computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n\t\"sync\"\n\t\"time\"\n\t\"math/big\"\n\t\"runtime\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tif len(os.Args) != 2 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Usage: go run factorial.go <number>\")\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\tnStr := os.Args[1]\n\tn, err := strconv.Atoi(nStr)\n\tif err != nil || n < 0 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Please enter a non-negative integer.\")\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\tif n == 0 || n == 1 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"1\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tstartTime := time.Now()\n\n\tnumGoroutines := runtime.NumCPU()\n\tif numGoroutines > n {\n\t\tnumGoroutines = n\n\t}\n\n\tchunkSize := (n + numGoroutines - 1) / numGoroutines\n\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\tpartialProducts := make(chan *big.Int, numGoroutines)\n\n\tfor i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {\n\t\tstart := n - i*chunkSize\n\t\tend := start - chunkSize + 1\n\t\tif end < 1 {\n\t\t\tend = 1\n\t\t}\n\t\twg.Add(1)\n\t\tgo func(start, end int) {\n\t\t\tdefer wg.Done()\n\t\t\tproduct := big.NewInt(1)\n\t\t\tfor j := start; j >= end; j-- {\n\t\t\t\tproduct.Mul(product, big.NewInt(int64(j)))\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpartialProducts <- product\n\t\t}(start, end)\n\t}\n\n\tgo func() {\n\t\twg.Wait()\n\t\tclose(partialProducts)\n\t}()\n\n\ttotalProduct := big.NewInt(1)\n\tfor pp := range partialProducts {\n\t\ttotalProduct.Mul(totalProduct, pp)\n\t}\n\n\telapsedTime := time.Since(startTime)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%d! = %s\\n\", n, totalProduct.String())\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Time taken: %s\\n\", elapsedTime)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The program expects a single command-line argument, which is the number to calculate the factorial of.\n   - It validates that the input is a non-negative integer.\n\n2. **Special Cases:**\n   - For `n` equal to 0 or 1, the factorial is directly set to 1, as per mathematical definitions.\n\n3. **Concurrency Management:**\n   - The program uses goroutines to perform multiplications in parallel.\n   - The number of goroutines is determined by the number of CPUs available, ensuring optimal usage of system resources.\n\n4. **Work Division:**\n   - The work is divided into chunks assigned to each goroutine.\n   - Each goroutine computes the product of a segment of the sequence from `n` down to 1.\n\n5. **Result Collection:**\n   - Partial products from each goroutine are collected via a channel.\n   - These partial products are multiplied together in the main function to get the final result.\n\n6. **Timing:**\n   - The time taken to compute the factorial is measured and displayed, providing insight into the performance of the concurrent approach."
