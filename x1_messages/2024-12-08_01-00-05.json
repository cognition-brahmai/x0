If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array. What is the time complexity of this algorithm?\nA. O(log n)\nB. O(n)\nC. O(n log n)\nD. O(n^2)"

        "content": "The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n). This is because with each comparison, the algorithm effectively halves the size of the problem, leading to a logarithmic growth rate in the number of operations required to find the target value. This makes binary search highly efficient for large, sorted arrays compared to linear search methods, which have a time complexity of O(n)."
