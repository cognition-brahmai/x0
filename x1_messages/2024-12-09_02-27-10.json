        "content": "Yes, many species of sharks do need to keep moving to breathe. This is because they rely on a process called \"ram ventilation,\" where water is forced over their gills as they swim forward. This allows them to extract oxygen from the water. However, not all sharks require constant movement to breathe; some species have adaptations that allow them to pump water over their gills even when they're stationary."
