        "content": "So there are 4 light switches, each controlling one light, and all lights are initially off. I need to find out how many different combinations of on and off lights I can achieve by flipping any number of these switches.\n\nHmm, let's see. Each switch can be in one of two states: on or off. Since there are 4 switches, and each can be independent of the others, I think the total number of combinations should be 2 raised to the power of 4, which is 16.\n\nWait a minute, but does that make sense? Let's list them out to be sure.\n\nStarting with all lights off: that's one combination.\n\nThen, flipping any one switch: there are 4 switches, so that's 4 more combinations.\n\nNext, flipping any two switches: how many ways are there to choose 2 switches out of 4? That's \"4 choose 2,\" which is 6.\n\nThen, flipping any three switches: \"4 choose 3,\" which is 4.\n\nAnd finally, flipping all four switches: that's one combination.\n\nSo, adding them up: 1 (all off) + 4 (one switch) + 6 (two switches) + 4 (three switches) + 1 (all on) = 16.\n\nYeah, that matches my initial thought of 2^4 = 16.\n\nBut let's think about it another way to confirm. Each switch controls one light independently, so the state of one light doesn't affect another. So, for each switch, there are 2 choices: on or off. Therefore, the total number of combinations should be 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 16.\n\nAlright, that lines up with the previous method.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using binary numbers. Since each switch can be on or off, we can represent each combination as a 4-bit binary number, where each bit represents a switch. For example:\n\n0000: all off\n\n0001: only the first switch on\n\n0010: only the second switch on\n\n0011: first and second switches on\n\nAnd so on, up to 1111: all on.\n\nAnd we know that there are 16 different 4-bit binary numbers, from 0000 to 1111.\n\nSo again, that gives us 16 combinations.\n\nWait, but is there any possibility that flipping different switches could lead to the same light combination? For example, if switching one switch affects another light, then maybe some combinations wouldn't be unique. But the problem says each switch controls one light, so I think each switch only affects its corresponding light and nothing else.\n\nTherefore, each switch flip is independent, and each combination is unique.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different combinations is 16.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the lights start off, and I flip switch 1 and switch 2, that should be the same as flipping switch 2 and then switch 1. The order doesn't matter; it's the final state that counts.\n\nSo, combinations, not permutations. That's why using \"n choose k\" makes sense for selecting which switches to flip.\n\nBut actually, since each switch is independent, and we're considering all possible states, using 2^n is the most straightforward way.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 16 different combinations of on and off lights that can be achieved by flipping any number of these 4 switches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
