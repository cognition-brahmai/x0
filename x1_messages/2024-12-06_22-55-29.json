The breeds are Azawakh, Norwegian Lundehund, Mudi, Otterhound, Kooikerhondje, and Peruvian Inca Orchid. I need to figure out which ones are small, which are medium, and which are large. I'm not super familiar with all of these breeds, so I might need to look up some information about their typical sizes.\n\nFirst, I know that dog breeds are generally classified based on their height and weight. The American Kennel Club (AKC) often uses specific weight ranges to define these categories, but I think it's more about relative size. Small dogs are usually those that are under 20 inches tall and weigh less than 30 pounds. Medium dogs are typically between 20 to 25 inches tall and weigh between 30 to 50 pounds. Large dogs are over 25 inches tall and weigh more than 50 pounds. But I should confirm these measurements for each breed.\n\nLet's start with the Azawakh. I recall that it's a breed from Africa, known for its elegance and speed. I think they're quite tall but relatively lean, so they might not weigh a lot. I'll need to check their average height and weight.\n\nNext, the Norwegian Lundehund. I remember that this breed is known for its unique physical characteristics, like having six toes on each foot and the ability to tilt their head back so that their forehead touches their backbone. They're probably small to medium in size, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe Mudi is a Hungarian herding breed. I think it's similar to the Puli and the Pumi, which are also Hungarian breeds. I believe the Mudi is a medium-sized dog, but I should confirm.\n\nThe Otterhound is a breed that was originally used for hunting otters. They look like they have a lot of hair and are probably on the larger side, but I'm not sure about their exact size.\n\nThe Kooikerhondje is a Dutch breed, often used for duck hunting. I think they're small to medium in size, with a distinctive coat and coloring.\n\nLastly, the Peruvian Inca Orchid is an interesting breed because it comes in both hairless and coated varieties. I believe they come in different sizes, so I need to see if they have small, medium, and large varieties or if they fit into one specific category.\n\nI think I should look up each breed's average height and weight to make an accurate classification. Let's start with the Azawakh.\n\nAzawakh:\n\n- Height: Males are about 25-29 inches at the withers, females are 23-27 inches.\n\n- Weight: Males weigh around 44-55 pounds, females are 33-44 pounds.\n\nGiven their height and weight, they seem to be on the larger side, so I would classify them as large dogs.\n\nNext, the Norwegian Lundehund:\n\n- Height: Males are about 12-15 inches, females are 12-14 inches.\n\n- Weight: Males weigh around 13-15 pounds, females are 11-13 pounds.\n\nBased on their small size, they are definitely small dogs.\n\nNow, the Mudi:\n\n- Height: Males are about 16-20 inches, females are 15-19 inches.\n\n- Weight: Males weigh around 22-33 pounds, females are 17-26 pounds.\n\nThey seem to be in the medium size category.\n\nOtterhound:\n\n- Height: Males are about 27 inches, females are 24 inches.\n\n- Weight: Males can weigh up to 115-130 pounds, females are around 80-105 pounds.\n\nThese dogs are definitely large.\n\nKooikerhondje:\n\n- Height: Males are about 14-16 inches, females are 12-14 inches.\n\n- Weight: Males weigh around 15-17 pounds, females are 11-15 pounds.\n\nThey appear to be small to medium in size, but based on their height and weight, I'd say they are small dogs.\n\nFinally, the Peruvian Inca Orchid:\n\n- This breed comes in three size varieties: small, medium, and large.\n\n- Small: up to 10 inches tall.\n\n- Medium: 10-15 inches tall.\n\n- Large: over 15 inches tall.\n\nSince they have distinct size varieties, they span across small, medium, and large categories.\n\nWait a minute, but in this task, I need to classify each breed into one category, but the Peruvian Inca Orchid has three size varieties. Maybe I should specify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Peruvian Inca Orchid should be classified based on their most common size, or perhaps I should note that they come in multiple sizes.\n\nI think the best approach is to note that Peruvian Inca Orchids come in small, medium, and large sizes.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Azawakh: Large\n\n- Norwegian Lundehund: Small\n\n- Mudi: Medium\n\n- Otterhound: Large\n\n- Kooikerhondje: Small\n\n- Peruvian Inca Orchid: Small, Medium, Large\n\nI think that's a fair classification based on their sizes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Azawakh: Large, Norwegian Lundehund: Small, Mudi: Medium, Otterhound: Large, Kooikerhondje: Small, Peruvian Inca Orchid: Small, Medium, Large}}"
