        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about 100 light bulbs lined up in a row, all starting off. I go through a series of passes where I toggle certain bulbs based on the pass number. So, on the first pass, I turn on every bulb. On the second pass, I switch off every second bulb. On the third pass, I toggle every third bulb, and so on, up to the 100th pass.\n\nOkay, so to understand which bulbs are on after all these passes, I need to think about how many times each bulb is toggled. Each bulb is toggled based on the passes that are multiples of its position. For example, bulb number 6 would be toggled on passes 1, 2, 3, and 6, because those are the divisors of 6.\n\nSo, for each bulb, the number of times it's toggled is equal to the number of its divisors. If a bulb is toggled an even number of times, it will end up off, because it starts off and toggling an even number of times brings it back to off. If it's toggled an odd number of times, it will end up on.\n\nNow, the question is, how many bulbs have an odd number of divisors?\n\nI recall that most numbers have an even number of divisors, but there's a special case for perfect squares. Perfect squares have an odd number of divisors because one of their divisors is repeated. For example, 9 has divisors 1, 3, and 9, where 3 is repeated because 3 times 3 is 9. So, for perfect squares, the number of divisors is odd.\n\nTherefore, the bulbs that are perfect squares will be toggled an odd number of times and will end up on.\n\nSo, I need to find out how many perfect squares there are between 1 and 100.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n1^2 = 1\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n6^2 = 36\n\n7^2 = 49\n\n8^2 = 64\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n10^2 = 100\n\nSo, there are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n\nTherefore, after the 100th pass, there should be 10 light bulbs left on.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I should consider the general case for any number of bulbs, not just 100.\n\nSuppose there are n bulbs. The number of bulbs left on after n passes would be equal to the number of perfect squares less than or equal to n.\n\nBecause only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nSo, in general, the number of bulbs left on is equal to the integer part of the square root of n, because the square root of n is the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to n.\n\nIn this case, n is 100, and the square root of 100 is 10, so there are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 10.\n\nBut let me double-check this logic.\n\nTake bulb number 1: divisors are 1 (toggled once) \u2013 on\n\nBulb 2: divisors are 1 and 2 (toggled twice) \u2013 off\n\nBulb 3: divisors are 1 and 3 (toggled twice) \u2013 off\n\nBulb 4: divisors are 1, 2, and 4 (toggled three times) \u2013 on\n\nBulb 5: divisors are 1 and 5 (toggled twice) \u2013 off\n\nBulb 6: divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6 (toggled four times) \u2013 off\n\nBulb 7: divisors are 1 and 7 (toggled twice) \u2013 off\n\nBulb 8: divisors are 1, 2, 4, and 8 (toggled four times) \u2013 off\n\nBulb 9: divisors are 1, 3, and 9 (toggled three times) \u2013 on\n\nBulb 10: divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10 (toggled four times) \u2013 off\n\nAnd so on, up to bulb 100.\n\nSo, only bulbs 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100 are on, which are the perfect squares.\n\nThus, the final answer is 10 light bulbs are left on after the 100th pass.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
