        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there's a factory that makes two types of products, X and Y. Each X brings in $10 profit, and each Y brings in $15. They sold a total of 1000 products and made $12,500 in profit. I need to find out how many of each they sold.\n\nFirst, I think I should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's let x be the number of product X sold, and y be the number of product Y sold.\n\nFrom the total number of products sold, I have:\n\nx + y = 1000\n\nAnd from the total profit, I have:\n\n10x + 15y = 12,500\n\nOkay, so now I have a system of two equations with two variables. I can solve this by substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is simpler here.\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 10, I get:\n\n10x + 10y = 10,000\n\nNow, if I subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(10x + 15y) - (10x + 10y) = 12,500 - 10,000\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n5y = 2,500\n\nSo, y = 2,500 / 5 = 500\n\nNow that I have y, I can plug it back into the first equation to find x:\n\nx + 500 = 1000\n\nx = 1000 - 500 = 500\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if these values make sense.\n\nIf x = 500 and y = 500, then the profit would be:\n\n10*500 + 15*500 = 5,000 + 7,500 = 12,500\n\nThat matches the total profit given. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps using ratios or something. Let's see.\n\nThe profit per X is $10, and per Y is $15. The average profit per product is 12,500 / 1,000 = $12.50.\n\nSo, the average profit is $12.50 per product. Since X is $10 and Y is $15, the ratio of X to Y should be such that the average is $12.50.\n\nLet me think about the ratio.\n\nThe difference between Y's profit and the average is $15 - $12.50 = $2.50.\n\nThe difference between the average and X's profit is $12.50 - $10 = $2.50.\n\nSo, the differences are equal. That might suggest that the number of X and Y are equal, which matches what I found earlier: x = 500, y = 500.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of weighted averages.\n\nLet r be the fraction of products that are Y. Then, the profit equation is:\n\n10*(1 - r) + 15*r = 12.5\n\nSolving for r:\n\n10 - 10r + 15r = 12.5\n\n10 + 5r = 12.5\n\n5r = 2.5\n\nr = 0.5\n\nSo, 50% of the products are Y, and 50% are X. Again, that suggests x = 500 and y = 500.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I think it's safe to say that the factory sold 500 units of product X and 500 units of product Y.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be other solutions. For example, if there were constraints I'm not considering, or if perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that both x and y are positive integers.\n\nGiven that x and y represent numbers of products sold, they must be non-negative integers. In this case, x = 500 and y = 500 are both positive integers, so they satisfy that condition.\n\nIs there any other way to satisfy the equations? Let's see.\n\nSuppose x + y = 1000 and 10x + 15y = 12,500.\n\nFrom the first equation, y = 1000 - x.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n10x + 15(1000 - x) = 12,500\n\n10x + 15,000 - 15x = 12,500\n\n-5x + 15,000 = 12,500\n\n-5x = -2,500\n\nx = 500\n\nThen y = 500.\n\nSo, there's only one solution to this system of equations, which is x = 500 and y = 500.\n\nI think that's definitive. There aren't multiple solutions here.\n\nAlternatively, if there were additional constraints, such as minimum or maximum numbers of each product that could be sold, that might affect the solution. But based on the information given, no such constraints are mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the factory sold 500 units of product X and 500 units of product Y.\n\nJust to explore further, suppose the numbers weren't so even. Let's say the profit was different. But in this case, with the given numbers, it's clear that equal numbers of X and Y were sold.\n\nI could also plot the equations to visualize the solution. The first equation is a straight line with slope -1, and the second equation is a straight line with slope -10/15 = -2/3.\n\nThe intersection point would be at x = 500, y = 500.\n\nBut since this is a straightforward algebra problem, graphing might be unnecessary, especially since it's efficient to solve it algebraically.\n\nIn conclusion, the factory sold 500 units of product X and 500 units of product Y to achieve a total profit of $12,500 from selling 1,000 products.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500 \\text{ units of product X and } 500 \\text{ units of product Y}} \\]"
