        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden that's originally 12 meters long and 8 meters wide. The owner wants to make it bigger by extending both the length and the width by the same amount, and the new area should be 50% larger than the original area. We need to find out what the new dimensions will be.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. The garden is rectangular, so its area is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The original area is 12 meters times 8 meters, which is 96 square meters. The owner wants to increase this area by 50%, so the new area should be 96 square meters plus 50% of 96 square meters.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n50% of 96 is 0.5 times 96, which is 48 square meters. So, the new area should be 96 plus 48, which is 144 square meters.\n\nNow, the owner wants to extend both the length and the width by the same amount. Let's call this amount \"x\" meters. So, the new length will be 12 + x meters, and the new width will be 8 + x meters.\n\nThe area of the extended garden will be (12 + x) times (8 + x), and we know this should equal 144 square meters.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(12 + x) * (8 + x) = 144\n\nNow, I need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, I'll expand the left side of the equation:\n\n12*8 + 12*x + 8*x + x^2 = 144\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n96 + 12x + 8x + x^2 = 144\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n96 + 20x + x^2 = 144\n\nNow, I'll move 144 to the left side to set the equation to zero:\n\nx^2 + 20x + 96 - 144 = 0\n\nSimplifying:\n\nx^2 + 20x - 48 = 0\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation: x^2 + 20x - 48 = 0\n\nI need to solve for x. I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 20, and c = -48.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = 20^2 - 4*1*(-48) = 400 + 192 = 592\n\nNow, the square root of 592 is... hmmm, 592 is not a perfect square. Let me see if I can simplify it.\n\n592 divided by 16 is 37, so sqrt(592) = sqrt(16*37) = 4*sqrt(37)\n\nSo, x = [-20 \u00b1 4*sqrt(37)] / 2\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nx = [-20 \u00b1 4*sqrt(37)] / 2 = -10 \u00b1 2*sqrt(37)\n\nNow, since x represents an extension, it must be a positive value. So, we'll take the positive solution:\n\nx = -10 + 2*sqrt(37)\n\nOkay, now I need to calculate the numerical value of x.\n\nFirst, find sqrt(37). 37 is between 36 and 49, so sqrt(37) is between 6 and 7. More precisely, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.0828.\n\nSo, x = -10 + 2*6.0828 = -10 + 12.1656 = 2.1656 meters\n\nApproximately, x is about 2.17 meters.\n\nNow, the new length will be 12 + 2.17 = 14.17 meters, and the new width will be 8 + 2.17 = 10.17 meters.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct.\n\nOriginal area: 12*8 = 96 m\u00b2\n\nNew area: 14.17*10.17 should be approximately 144 m\u00b2.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n14.17 * 10.17 = Let's see, 14*10 is 140, and the rest is small, so approximately 143.5 m\u00b2, which is close to 144 m\u00b2, considering rounding errors.\n\nSo, the new dimensions are approximately 14.17 meters in length and 10.17 meters in width.\n\nAlternatively, I can present the answer in exact form.\n\nSince x = -10 + 2*sqrt(37), the new length is 12 + x = 12 - 10 + 2*sqrt(37) = 2 + 2*sqrt(37) meters\n\nAnd the new width is 8 + x = 8 - 10 + 2*sqrt(37) = -2 + 2*sqrt(37) meters\n\nBut it's probably more understandable in decimal form.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 14.17 meters by 10.17 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14.17 \\text{ meters by } 10.17 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
