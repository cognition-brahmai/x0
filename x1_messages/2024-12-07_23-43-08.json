        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we have a company with 120 employees. According to the information:\n\n- 40% work in sales\n\n- 30% work in marketing\n\n- The remaining employees work in operations\n\nSo, let's calculate how many employees are in each department.\n\nFirst, sales:\n\n40% of 120 employees = 0.40 * 120 = 48 employees\n\nNext, marketing:\n\n30% of 120 employees = 0.30 * 120 = 36 employees\n\nNow, to find the number of employees in operations, we can subtract the sales and marketing employees from the total:\n\nEmployees in operations = Total employees - (Sales employees + Marketing employees)\n\n= 120 - (48 + 36)\n\n= 120 - 84\n\n= 36 employees\n\nSo, currently, there are 36 employees in operations.\n\nNow, the company plans to hire an additional 20 employees, all of whom will work in operations. So, after hiring, the number of operations employees will be:\n\n36 (current) + 20 (new) = 56 employees\n\nThe total workforce after hiring will be:\n\n120 (current) + 20 (new) = 140 employees\n\nWe need to find the percentage of the total workforce that will be in operations after the new hires join. So, we'll calculate:\n\n(Operations employees after hiring / Total employees after hiring) * 100%\n\n= (56 / 140) * 100%\n\nFirst, let's divide 56 by 140:\n\n56 \u00f7 140 = 0.4\n\nThen, multiply by 100% to get the percentage:\n\n0.4 * 100% = 40%\n\nSo, after hiring the additional 20 employees in operations, 40% of the total workforce will be in operations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
