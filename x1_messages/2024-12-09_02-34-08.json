The question is asking for the probability of picking a green ball, but looking at the contents of the bag, there are only red and blue balls mentioned. There doesn't seem to be any green balls in the bag.\n\nSo, if there are no green balls in the bag, the probability of picking a green ball would be zero, right? Because it's impossible to pick something that isn't there.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the question is a trick question or something. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the number of green balls is zero, and the total number of balls is 7. So, probability = 0/7 = 0.\n\nI think the answer is zero. There's no chance of picking a green ball because there are no green balls in the bag.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
