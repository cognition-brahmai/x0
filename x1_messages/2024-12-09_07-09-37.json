Old Iohn of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster, Hast thou according to thy oath and band Brought hither Henry Herford thy bold son: Heere to make good y boistrous late appeale, Which then our leysure would not let vs heare, Against the Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Mowbray? Gaunt. I haue my Liege\nKing. Tell me moreouer, hast thou sounded him, If he appeale the Duke on ancient malice, Or worthily as a good subiect should On some knowne ground of treacherie in him\nGaunt. As neere as I could sift him on that argument, On some apparant danger seene in him, Aym'd at your Highnesse, no inueterate malice\nKin. Then call them to our presence face to face, And frowning brow to brow, our selues will heare Th' accuser, and the accused, freely speake; High stomack'd are they both, and full of ire, In rage, deafe as the sea; hastie as fire. Enter Bullingbrooke and Mowbray.\nBul. Many yeares of happy dayes befall My gracious Soueraigne, my most louing Liege\nMow. Each day still better others happinesse, Vntill the heauens enuying earths good hap, Adde an immortall title to your Crowne\nKing. We thanke you both, yet one but flatters vs, As well appeareth by the cause you come, Namely, to appeale each other of high treason. Coosin of Hereford, what dost thou obiect Against the Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Mowbray? Bul. First, heauen be the record to my speech, In the deuotion of a subiects loue, Tendering the precious safetie of my Prince, And free from other misbegotten hate, Come I appealant to this Princely presence. Now Thomas Mowbray do I turne to thee, And marke my greeting well: for what I speake, My body shall make good vpon this earth, Or my diuine soule answer it in heauen. Thou art a Traitor, and a Miscreant; Too good to be so, and too bad to liue, Since the more faire and christall is the skie, The vglier seeme the cloudes that in it flye: Once more, the more to aggrauate the note, With a foule Traitors name stuffe I thy throte, And wish (so please my Soueraigne) ere I moue, What my tong speaks, my right drawn sword may proue Mow. Let not my cold words heere accuse my zeale: 'Tis not the triall of a Womans warre, The bitter clamour of two eager tongues, Can arbitrate this cause betwixt vs twaine: The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this. Yet can I not of such tame patience boast, As to be husht, and nought at all to say. First the faire reuerence of your Highnesse curbes mee, From giuing reines and spurres to my free speech, Which else would post, vntill it had return'd These tearmes of treason, doubly downe his throat. Setting aside his high bloods royalty, And let him be no Kinsman to my Liege, I do defie him, and I spit at him, Call him a slanderous Coward, and a Villaine: Which to maintaine, I would allow him oddes, And meete him, were I tide to runne afoote, Euen to the frozen ridges of the Alpes, Or any other ground inhabitable, Where euer Englishman durst set his foote. Meane time, let this defend my loyaltie, By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie\nBul. Pale trembling Coward, there I throw my gage, Disclaiming heere the kindred of a King, And lay aside my high bloods Royalty, Which feare, not reuerence makes thee to except. If guilty dread hath left thee so much strength, As to take vp mine Honors pawne, then stoope. By that, and all the rites of Knight-hood else, Will I make good against thee arme to arme, What I haue spoken, or thou canst deuise\nMow. I take it vp, and by that sword I sweare, Which gently laid my Knight-hood on my shoulder, Ile answer thee in any faire degree, Or Chiualrous designe of knightly triall: And when I mount, aliue may I not light, If I be Traitor, or vniustly fight\nKing. What doth our Cosin lay to Mowbraies charge? It must be great that can inherite vs, So much as of a thought of ill in him\nBul. Looke what I said, my life shall proue it true, That Mowbray hath receiu'd eight thousand Nobles, In name of lendings for your Highnesse Soldiers, The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments, Like a false Traitor, and iniurious Villaine. Besides I say, and will in battaile proue, Or heere, or elsewhere to the furthest Verge That euer was suruey'd by English eye, That all the Treasons for these eighteene yeeres Complotted, and contriued in this Land, Fetch'd from false Mowbray their first head and spring. Further I say, and further will maintaine Vpon his bad life, to make all this good. That he did plot the Duke of Glousters death, Suggest his soone beleeuing aduersaries, And consequently, like a Traitor Coward, Sluc'd out his innocent soule through streames of blood: Which blood, like sacrificing Abels cries, (Euen from the toonglesse cauernes of the earth) To me for iustice, and rough chasticement: And by the glorious worth of my discent, This arme shall do it, or this life be spent\nKing. How high a pitch his resolution soares: Thomas of Norfolke, what sayest thou to this? Mow. Oh let my Soueraigne turne away his face, And bid his eares a little while be deafe, Till I haue told this slander of his blood, How God, and good men, hate so foule a lyar\nKing. Mowbray, impartiall are our eyes and eares, Were he my brother, nay our kingdomes heyre, As he is but my fathers brothers sonne; Now by my Scepters awe, I make a vow, Such neighbour-neerenesse to our sacred blood, Should nothing priuiledge him, nor partialize The vn-stooping firmenesse of my vpright soule. He is our subiect (Mowbray) so art thou, Free speech, and fearelesse, I to thee allow\nMow. Then Bullingbrooke, as low as to thy heart, Through the false passage of thy throat; thou lyest: Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice, Disburst I to his Highnesse souldiers; The other part reseru'd I by consent, For that my Soueraigne Liege was in my debt, Vpon remainder of a deere Accompt, Since last I went to France to fetch his Queene: Now swallow downe that Lye. For Glousters death, I slew him not; but (to mine owne disgrace) Neglected my sworne duty in that case: For you my noble Lord of Lancaster, The honourable Father to my foe, Once I did lay an ambush for your life, A trespasse that doth vex my greeued soule: But ere I last receiu'd the Sacrament, I did confesse it, and exactly begg'd Your Graces pardon, and I hope I had it. This is my fault: as for the rest appeal'd, It issues from the rancour of a Villaine, A recreant, and most degenerate Traitor, Which in my selfe I boldly will defend, And interchangeably hurle downe my gage Vpon this ouer-weening Traitors foote, To proue my selfe a loyall Gentleman, Euen in the best blood chamber'd in his bosome. In hast whereof, most heartily I pray Your Highnesse to assigne our Triall day\nKing. Wrath-kindled Gentlemen be rul'd by me: Let's purge this choller without letting blood: This we prescribe, though no Physition, Deepe malice makes too deepe incision. Forget, forgiue, conclude, and be agreed, Our Doctors say, This is no time to bleed. Good Vnckle, let this end where it begun, Wee'l calme the Duke of Norfolke; you, your son\nGaunt. To be a make-peace shall become my age, Throw downe (my sonne) the Duke of Norfolkes gage\nKing. And Norfolke, throw downe his\nGaunt. When Harrie when? Obedience bids, Obedience bids I should not bid agen\nKing. Norfolke, throw downe, we bidde; there is no boote\nMow. My selfe I throw (dread Soueraigne) at thy foot. My life thou shalt command, but not my shame, The one my dutie owes, but my faire name Despight of death, that liues vpon my graue To darke dishonours vse, thou shalt not haue. I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffel'd heere, Pierc'd to the soule with slanders venom'd speare: The which no balme can cure, but his heart blood Which breath'd this poyson\nKing. Rage must be withstood: Giue me his gage: Lyons make Leopards tame\nMo. Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame, And I resigne my gage. My deere, deere Lord, The purest treasure mortall times afford Is spotlesse reputation: that away, Men are but gilded loame, or painted clay. A Iewell in a ten times barr'd vp Chest, Is a bold spirit, in a loyall brest. Mine Honor is my life; both grow in one: Take Honor from me, and my life is done. Then (deere my Liege) mine Honor let me trie, In that I liue; and for that will I die\nKing. Coosin, throw downe your gage, Do you begin\nBul. Oh heauen defend my soule from such foule sin. Shall I seeme Crest-falne in my fathers sight, Or with pale beggar-feare impeach my hight Before this out-dar'd dastard? Ere my toong, Shall wound mine honor with such feeble wrong; Or sound so base a parle: my teeth shall teare The slauish motiue of recanting feare, And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace, Where shame doth harbour, euen in Mowbrayes face.\nExit Gaunt.\nKing. We were not borne to sue, but to command, Which since we cannot do to make you friends, Be readie, (as your liues shall answer it) At Couentree, vpon S[aint]. Lamberts day: There shall your swords and Lances arbitrate The swelling difference of your setled hate: Since we cannot attone you, you shall see Iustice designe the Victors Chiualrie. Lord Marshall, command our Officers at Armes, Be readie to direct these home Alarmes.\nExeunt.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 330 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"

        "content": "Actus Primus, Scaena Prima begins with King Richard, John of Gaunt (also known as Old John of Lancaster), and other nobles and attendants present. The king inquires about Henry Bolingbroke (here referred to as Henry Herford, his son) and Thomas Mowbray (the Duke of Norfolk), who are to face each other in a trial by combat over Mowbray's alleged treason.\n\nJohn of Gaunt confirms that he has brought his son Bolingbroke to make good on his boisterous appeal against Mowbray. The king wants to know if the appeal is based on ancient malice or on genuine grounds of treachery. Gaunt reports that Bolingbroke claims to have seen apparent danger to the king in Mowbray's actions.\n\nThe king then calls both Bolingbroke and Mowbray to his presence to hear their accusations face to face. He notes that both are full of ire and deaf to reason, much like the sea and fire.\n\nBolingbroke and Mowbray enter, exchanging formal greetings with the king. The king asks Bolingbroke what he accuses Mowbray of. Bolingbroke swears on his devotion to the king and his country that Mowbray is a traitor and a miscreant. He accuses Mowbray of receiving 8,000 nobles intended for the king's soldiers and misusing them for evil purposes. He further alleges that all treasons in the realm for the past eighteen years stem from Mowbray and that Mowbray plotted the Duke of Gloucester's death.\n\nMowbray defends himself, denying the accusations and calling Bolingbroke a liar. He admits to having received money for the soldiers but explains that he disbursed it accordingly and kept some with the king's consent for a debt. He also admits to plotting against John of Gaunt but says he has since confessed and sought forgiveness.\n\nThe king, being impartial, allows both to speak freely. He vows that even if Bolingbroke were his brother or heir, he would not show him any partiality in this matter.\n\nMowbray challenges Bolingbroke to prove his accusations in combat, throwing down his gauntlet. Bolingbroke accepts the challenge, throwing down his own gauntlet.\n\nJohn of Gaunt, moved by the situation, steps in to try to reconcile them, asking his son to withdraw his accusation. The king also urges them to forget their differences and be at peace.\n\nHowever, Mowbray insists on defending his honor through combat, declaring that his reputation is his life and that he will die to defend it.\n\nThe king, seeing that reconciliation is impossible, decides that they shall settle their differences in combat at Coventry on St. Lambert's Day. He commands the Marshal to prepare for this event, as justice will determine the victor's chivalry.\n\nThe scene ends with the king's officers being ordered to prepare for this duel, which is seen as the only way to resolve their deep-seated hatred.\n\nThis scene sets up the central conflict between Bolingbroke and Mowbray, driven by accusations of treason and the defense of honor, leading to a trial by combat sanctioned by the king."
