        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem here about a group of people consisting of engineers and doctors, and they're wearing different colored hats. All engineers have red hats, and all doctors have blue hats. It also says that there are twice as many engineers as there are doctors, and altogether, there are 24 hats. I need to figure out how many doctors are in the group.\n\nFirst, I should probably define some variables to represent the number of engineers and doctors. Let's say:\n\n- Let D represent the number of doctors.\n\n- Since there are twice as many engineers as doctors, the number of engineers would be 2D.\n\nNow, each person has one hat, right? So, the total number of hats should be equal to the total number of people in the group. That means:\n\nTotal hats = number of engineers + number of doctors = 2D + D = 3D\n\nBut it's given that there are 24 hats in total. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n3D = 24\n\nNow, to find D, I just need to divide both sides by 3:\n\nD = 24 / 3\n\nD = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 doctors in the group.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If there are 8 doctors, then there are twice as many engineers, which would be 16 engineers. Total hats would be 8 (doctors) + 16 (engineers) = 24, which matches the given information.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
