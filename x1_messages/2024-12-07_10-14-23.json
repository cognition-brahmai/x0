        "content": "Let's see here. I have this question about matching festivals to their cultural significance, and there are five options to choose from. I need to make sure I get all the matches correct. Let me recall what I know about each festival.\n\nFirst, there's Diwali in India. I remember that it's often called the Festival of Lights and it symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil. So, that seems straightforward.\n\nNext, Mexico's Day of the Dead, or D\u00eda de los Muertos. This is a time when families remember and honor their deceased loved ones. There are altars, offerings, and celebrations that connect the living with the departed. It's not about mourning but about celebrating the lives of those who have passed away.\n\nThen, Japan's Cherry Blossom Festival, also known as Hanami. This festival celebrates the beauty of cherry blossoms, which are a symbol of the transience of life in Japanese culture. It's all about welcoming spring and appreciating the fleeting beauty of nature.\n\nBrazil's Carnival is a big pre-Lenten celebration, famous for its parades, samba dances, and elaborate costumes. It's a time of revelry and festivity before the more solemn period of Lent.\n\nLastly, Spain's La Tomatina is a unique festival where people throw tomatoes at each other in a big food fight. It's said to have no religious or symbolic meaning but is simply a fun local tradition.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: Diwali - Spring welcome, Day of the Dead - Victory of light, Cherry Blossom Festival - Honoring deceased, Carnival - Tomato throwing, La Tomatina - Pre-Lenten celebration.\n\nHmm, this doesn't seem right. Diwali is about the victory of light, not spring welcome. Day of the Dead is about honoring the deceased, not the victory of light. Cherry Blossom Festival is about welcoming spring, not honoring the deceased. Carnival is a pre-Lenten celebration, not tomato throwing. La Tomatina is the tomato throwing festival, not a pre-Lenten celebration.\n\nOption B: Diwali - Tomato throwing, Day of the Dead - Spring welcome, Cherry Blossom Festival - Pre-Lenten celebration, Carnival - Victory of light, La Tomatina - Honoring deceased.\n\nThis seems completely mixed up. None of these match what I know about the festivals.\n\nOption C: Diwali - Honoring deceased, Day of the Dead - Tomato throwing, Cherry Blossom Festival - Victory of light, Carnival - Spring welcome, La Tomatina - Pre-Lenten celebration.\n\nAgain, not accurate. Diwali is about the victory of light, not honoring the deceased. Day of the Dead is about honoring the deceased, not tomato throwing. Cherry Blossom Festival is about welcoming spring, not the victory of light. Carnival is pre-Lenten, not spring welcome. La Tomatina is the tomato throwing festival.\n\nOption D: Diwali - Pre-Lenten celebration, Day of the Dead - Spring welcome, Cherry Blossom Festival - Tomato throwing, Carnival - Honoring deceased, La Tomatina - Victory of light.\n\nThis is also incorrect. Diwali is not a pre-Lenten celebration; it's related to Hinduism and the victory of light. Day of the Dead is about honoring the deceased, not spring welcome. Cherry Blossom Festival is about welcoming spring, not tomato throwing. Carnival is pre-Lenten, not honoring the deceased. La Tomatina is the tomato throwing festival, not about the victory of light.\n\nOption E: Diwali - Victory of light, Day of the Dead - Honoring deceased, Cherry Blossom Festival - Spring welcome, Carnival - Pre-Lenten celebration, La Tomatina - No religious or symbolic meaning.\n\nThis seems to align with what I know about each festival. Diwali is about the victory of light over darkness. Day of the Dead is about honoring deceased loved ones. Cherry Blossom Festival welcomes spring. Carnival is a pre-Lenten celebration. La Tomatina is a fun festival with no religious or symbolic meaning.\n\nSo, based on this, option E seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me verify each one again.\n\nDiwali: Victory of light over darkness \u2013 yes, that's correct.\n\nDay of the Dead: Honoring deceased loved ones \u2013 correct.\n\nCherry Blossom Festival: Welcoming spring \u2013 correct.\n\nCarnival: Pre-Lenten celebration \u2013 correct.\n\nLa Tomatina: No religious or symbolic meaning \u2013 correct, it's just a fun festival.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
