        "content": "So the car factory makes 350 cars every day, and each car needs 4 tires. We want to know how many tires are needed for a whole week's production. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many cars are produced in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, and they make 350 cars each day, I can multiply 350 by 7 to get the total number of cars produced in a week.\n\nSo, 350 cars/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 2450 cars/week.\n\nNow, each of these 2450 cars needs 4 tires. So, to find the total number of tires needed, I should multiply the number of cars by the number of tires per car.\n\nThat is, 2450 cars \u00d7 4 tires/car = 9800 tires.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to think about it. Since they produce 350 cars per day and each car needs 4 tires, the factory needs 350 \u00d7 4 = 1400 tires per day.\n\nThen, for a week, which is 7 days, they would need 1400 tires/day \u00d7 7 days = 9800 tires.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier. So, the factory needs 9800 tires for one week's worth of production.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the number of tires needed. For example, are there any defective tires or cars? Does the factory produce different types of cars that might require different numbers of tires? But based on the information given, it seems like all cars require 4 tires, and there's no mention of any defects, so I think 9800 is the correct answer.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that my calculations are accurate. Let me redo the math.\n\nFirst, 350 cars/day \u00d7 7 days = 2450 cars/week.\n\nThen, 2450 cars \u00d7 4 tires/car = 9800 tires.\n\nAlternatively, 350 cars/day \u00d7 4 tires/car = 1400 tires/day.\n\nThen, 1400 tires/day \u00d7 7 days = 9800 tires.\n\nYes, both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 9800 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9800} \\]"
