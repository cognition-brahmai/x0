In Greek mythology, Troy is the city that was destroyed during the Trojan War, which was sparked by the abduction of Helen, the wife of Menelaus, by Paris, a prince of Troy. The most famous part of this story is the Trojan Horse, a large wooden horse that the Greeks used to infiltrate the city of Troy and ultimately win the war. So, the city you're thinking of is Troy."
