        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 12 black balls, 8 white balls, and 4 red balls. That means the total number of balls in the box is 12 + 8 + 4, which equals 24 balls.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that both balls picked are black, and we're picking two balls without replacement. Without replacement means that once we pick the first ball, it doesn't go back into the box, so the total number of balls decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of picking a black ball on the first draw. There are 12 black balls out of 24 total balls, so the probability is 12/24, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNow, since we're not replacing the first ball, there are now 23 balls left in the box, and only 11 black balls remaining (since we already picked one black ball).\n\nSo, the probability of picking a second black ball is 11/23.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together (both balls being black), we multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (1/2) * (11/23).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(1/2) * (11/23) = 11/(2*23) = 11/46.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls picked are black is 11/46.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 24 is \"24 choose 2,\" which is calculated as 24! / (2! * (24-2)!) = (24*23)/2 = 276.\n\nThe number of ways to pick 2 black balls out of 12 is \"12 choose 2,\" which is (12*11)/2 = 66.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 66/276.\n\nSimplifying 66/276 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6, we get 11/46, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, whether we use the step-by-step approach or the combination formula, we arrive at the same probability of 11/46.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{46}} \\]"
