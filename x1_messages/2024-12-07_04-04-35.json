        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we have a company with 100 employees. Each employee works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and earns $20 per hour. We need to find out how much the company spends on salaries in one year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many hours each employee works in a week. They work 8 hours a day for 5 days, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 hours per week.\n\nNext, to find out how much each employee earns per week, we multiply the hours per week by the hourly wage. So, 40 hours * $20/hour = $800 per week.\n\nNow, to find out the total weekly salary for all 100 employees, we multiply the weekly salary of one employee by the number of employees. That's $800 * 100 = $80,000 per week.\n\nBut we need to find the annual salary expenditure. Assuming there are 52 weeks in a year, we can multiply the weekly total by 52. So, $80,000 * 52 = $4,160,000 per year.\n\nWait a minute, but we should consider if there are any holidays or vacation days where employees don't work. Typically, companies have some days off for holidays. Let's assume there are 10 holidays per year where employees don't work. That means instead of 52 weeks, it's 52 weeks - 10 days.\n\nBut since the employees work 5 days a week, 10 holidays would be 10 days / 5 = 2 weeks less. So, total weeks worked in a year would be 52 - 2 = 50 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the annual salary expenditure would be $80,000 * 50 = $4,000,000 per year.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate it based on days. There are 5 days per week, 50 weeks per year (since 2 weeks are holidays), so total days in a year are 5 * 50 = 250 days.\n\nEach employee works 8 hours a day, so total hours per year per employee are 250 * 8 = 2,000 hours.\n\nAt $20 per hour, each employee earns 2,000 * $20 = $40,000 per year.\n\nWith 100 employees, the total annual salary expenditure is $40,000 * 100 = $4,000,000.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation of $4,000,000 per year.\n\nBut let's double-check the holiday assumption. If there are 10 holidays per year, and employees don't work those days, then indeed, the number of working days is 250.\n\nAlternatively, if those 10 holidays are in addition to the standard 52 weeks, then we need to adjust accordingly. But for simplicity, assuming 50 weeks of work in a year is a common approximation.\n\nTherefore, the company spends $4,000,000 on salaries in one year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000000} \\]"
