        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 2(3x - 5) + 7 = 4(x + 2). Okay, let's start by simplifying both sides of the equation. First, I'll distribute the 2 on the left side and the 4 on the right side.\n\nSo, on the left side, 2 times 3x is 6x, and 2 times -5 is -10. So that gives me 6x - 10. Then I have plus 7. So altogether, the left side is 6x - 10 + 7. Now, on the right side, 4 times x is 4x, and 4 times 2 is 8. So the right side is 4x + 8.\n\nNow, let's simplify the left side further. I have 6x - 10 + 7. Combining the constants, -10 + 7 is -3. So the left side simplifies to 6x - 3.\n\nSo now the equation is 6x - 3 = 4x + 8.\n\nNext, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other side. Let's subtract 4x from both sides to get rid of the x terms on the right side. So, 6x - 4x is 2x, and on the right side, 4x - 4x is 0. So now the equation is 2x - 3 = 8.\n\nNow, let's add 3 to both sides to get rid of the -3 on the left side. So, 2x - 3 + 3 is 2x, and 8 + 3 is 11. So now the equation is 2x = 11.\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x. So, x = 11/2, which is 5.5.\n\nWait a minute, let me check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: 2(3x - 5) + 7 = 4(x + 2)\n\nLeft side: 2*3x = 6x, 2*(-5) = -10, plus 7: 6x -10 +7 = 6x -3\n\nRight side: 4*x = 4x, 4*2 = 8: 4x + 8\n\nSo, 6x -3 = 4x + 8\n\nSubtract 4x from both sides: 2x -3 = 8\n\nAdd 3 to both sides: 2x = 11\n\nDivide by 2: x = 11/2 or 5.5\n\nSeems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}} \\]\n"
