        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A in 8 hours. I need to find out how long it will take to produce 1,250 units at the same production rate.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the production rate per hour. So, if 500 units are produced in 8 hours, the hourly production rate is 500 units divided by 8 hours. That would be:\n\n500 units / 8 hours = 62.5 units per hour\n\nSo, the factory produces 62.5 units each hour.\n\nNow, I need to produce 1,250 units. To find out how many hours it will take, I can divide the total number of units needed by the hourly production rate.\n\n1,250 units / 62.5 units per hour = 20 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take 20 hours to produce 1,250 units at the same production rate.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to set up a proportion. If 500 units take 8 hours, then 1,250 units will take x hours.\n\nSo, 500 units : 8 hours = 1,250 units : x hours\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n500/8 = 1,250/x\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n500x = 8 * 1,250\n\n500x = 10,000\n\nx = 10,000 / 500\n\nx = 20 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it definitely looks like 20 hours is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many times 500 units goes into 1,250 units. 1,250 divided by 500 is 2.5. So, it's 2.5 times the original production run.\n\nTherefore, if the original production time is 8 hours, then 2.5 times that would be 8 * 2.5 = 20 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect the production time. For example, is there a setup time, or does the production rate change over time? But based on the information given, it seems like the production rate is constant, and there are no additional setup times or variables to consider.\n\nSo, I can confidently say that it will take 20 hours to produce 1,250 units at the same production rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
