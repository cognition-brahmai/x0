Let me try again.\n\nWhy did the book go to school?\n\nBecause it wanted to learn how to spell better!\n\nHmm, maybe not the best joke. How about this one?\n\nWhy did the book go to the doctor?\n\nIt had a bad spine!\n\nI hope that made you smile. If you have any other questions or need more jokes, feel free to ask!"
