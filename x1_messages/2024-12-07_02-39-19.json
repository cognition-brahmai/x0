        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a city planning to build a new sports complex. They've got a total budget of $2 million, and they need to spend certain amounts on different parts of the complex. Let's see what they need to build and how much each part costs.\n\nFirst, there's a soccer field that costs $800,000. Then, there are basketball courts costing $600,000, and a swimming pool that's $400,000. After that, they need to allocate funds for landscaping, parking lots, and other amenities, which will be 10% of the remaining budget after the main facilities are paid for.\n\nOkay, so my task is to calculate how much money is allocated for these additional features. To do that, I need to follow a step-by-step approach.\n\nStep 1: Find out the total cost of the main facilities.\n\nThe main facilities are the soccer field, basketball courts, and swimming pool. So, I'll add up their costs:\n\nSoccer field: $800,000\n\nBasketball courts: $600,000\n\nSwimming pool: $400,000\n\nTotal main facilities cost = $800,000 + $600,000 + $400,000 = $1,800,000\n\nStep 2: Calculate the remaining budget after the main facilities are paid for.\n\nTotal budget: $2,000,000\n\nMinus total main facilities cost: $1,800,000\n\nRemaining budget = $2,000,000 - $1,800,000 = $200,000\n\nStep 3: Determine the amount allocated for additional features.\n\nThe additional features (landscaping, parking lots, etc.) will account for 10% of the remaining budget.\n\nSo, 10% of $200,000 is calculated as:\n\n10% of $200,000 = 0.10 * $200,000 = $20,000\n\nTherefore, the amount allocated for landscaping, parking lots, and other amenities is $20,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the total budget is $2 million.\n\nThe main facilities cost $800,000 + $600,000 + $400,000 = $1,800,000.\n\nSubtracting that from the total budget: $2,000,000 - $1,800,000 = $200,000 remaining.\n\nThen, 10% of $200,000 is indeed $20,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe the 10% is not just of the remaining budget, but of something else. Let me read the problem again to make sure.\n\n\"It needs to allocate funds for landscaping, parking lots, and other amenities, which will account for 10% of the remaining budget.\"\n\nSo, it's clearly 10% of whatever is left after the main facilities are paid for.\n\nTherefore, $20,000 is the correct amount allocated for these additional features.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20000} \\]"
