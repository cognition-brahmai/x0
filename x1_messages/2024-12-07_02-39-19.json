        "content": "So, there are four friends who initially agree to split a $100 gift equally. That means each was going to pay $100 divided by 4, which is $25 each. But then one friend backs out, so now only three friends are left to share the cost.\n\nTo find out how much each of the remaining three friends needs to contribute, we need to divide the total cost by three instead of four. So, $100 divided by 3.\n\nLet me do the calculation: 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333..., which we can round to $33.33 per person.\n\nBut to be precise, let's check if 3 times $33.33 equals $100. 3 times 33.33 is $99.99, which is slightly less than $100. To make up the difference, one friend could pay an extra $0.01, or they could round it differently. But generally, in practical terms, each friend would pay $33.33, and perhaps one friend would pay $33.34 to make the total exactly $100.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid dealing with cents, they could agree that two friends pay $33.33 and one pays $33.34, or find another way to distribute the extra penny.\n\nBut the main point is that with three friends sharing the cost, each needs to contribute approximately $33.33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33.33} \\]"
