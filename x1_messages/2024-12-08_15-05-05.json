        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, total balls in the bag are 4 + 6 + 5, which is 15 balls. The question is, if I draw 3 balls at random without replacement, what's the probability that none of them are red?\n\nAlright, so first things first, I need to find the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 15. Since the order doesn't matter, it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 15 is C(15, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3! * (15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455.\n\nOkay, so there are 455 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 15.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to draw 3 balls that are not red. That means all 3 balls should be either blue or green.\n\nLooking back at the bag, there are 6 blue balls and 5 green balls, so total non-red balls are 6 + 5 = 11.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 balls from these 11 non-red balls is C(11, 3).\n\nCalculating C(11, 3):\n\nC(11, 3) = 11! / (3! * (11 - 3)!) = (11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 165.\n\nSo, there are 165 ways to choose 3 non-red balls from the 11 available.\n\nNow, to find the probability that none of the 3 balls drawn are red, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = number of favorable outcomes / total number of possible outcomes = 165 / 455.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction. Both 165 and 455 are divisible by 5.\n\n165 \u00f7 5 = 33\n\n455 \u00f7 5 = 91\n\nSo, 165/455 simplifies to 33/91.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if this can be simplified further. 33 and 91 don't have any common factors other than 1, so 33/91 is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that none of the 3 balls drawn are red is 33/91.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can also approach this problem step by step, considering the draws one by one without replacement.\n\nSo, first draw: probability that it's not red. There are 11 non-red balls out of 15 total balls, so 11/15.\n\nThen, second draw: since I didn't replace the first ball, there are now 10 non-red balls left and total balls are 14. So, probability is 10/14.\n\nThird draw: now 9 non-red balls left and total balls are 13. So, probability is 9/13.\n\nSince these are consecutive events without replacement, I need to multiply these probabilities together to get the overall probability.\n\nSo, probability = (11/15) \u00d7 (10/14) \u00d7 (9/13).\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, (11/15) \u00d7 (10/14) = (11 \u00d7 10) / (15 \u00d7 14) = 110 / 210.\n\nSimplify 110/210 by dividing numerator and denominator by 10: 11/21.\n\nThen, multiply by the third probability: (11/21) \u00d7 (9/13) = (11 \u00d7 9) / (21 \u00d7 13) = 99 / 273.\n\nSimplify 99/273 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 33 / 91.\n\nSo, again, I get 33/91.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result using combinations. So, it seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it another way. Let's see.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 3 balls: C(15, 3) = 455.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 non-red balls: C(11, 3) = 165.\n\nProbability: 165 / 455 = 33/91.\n\nAlternatively, using permutations since order might matter, but in combinations, order doesn't matter, so combinations are appropriate here.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step approach, I considered the order implicitly by multiplying probabilities for each draw, but since it's without replacement, the probabilities change with each draw.\n\nBut in the combinations approach, order doesn't matter, which is why it's simpler.\n\nBoth approaches lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think 33/91 is the correct probability that none of the 3 balls drawn are red.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it, maybe using complementary probability or something, but I think this is straightforward enough.\n\nJust to confirm, 33/91 is approximately 0.3626, or about 36.26%. That seems reasonable, considering there are more non-red balls than red balls in the bag.\n\nSo, final answer: 33/91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{33}{91}} \\]"
