        "content": "Beauty is numbering's song,\nIn figures, softly throng;\nA dance where reason holds the hand,\nIn patterns, grand and grand.\n\nIn sums and shapes, a secret lies,\nWhere logic, gently, ties\nThe threads of thought, in endless weave,\nA tapestry to believe.\n\nOh, math, thy name is mystery,\nIn equations, set free;\nEach symbol speaks a silent tongue,\nIn harmony, they're strung.\n\nLike nature's laws, thy principles stand,\nImmutable, grand;\nThrough space and time, thy truths remain,\nA constant, never wane.\n\nThough some may find in thee a dread,\nA labyrinth, instead;\nI see in thee a wondrous land,\nWhere beauty does expand.\n\nFor in thy depths, I find delight,\nIn problems, taking flight;\nEach solution, a new discovery,\nIn knowledge, a legacy.\n\nSo here's to math, in rhymes I sing,\nThy beauty, I do bring;\nFor in thy realm, I find my peace,\nIn numbers, I find release.\n\n**[Author's Note]**: Emily Dickinson is known for her unique style of poetry, characterized by its brevity, use of dashes, off-rhymes, and unconventional capitalization. She often wrote about themes of nature, mortality, and the human condition. In this poem, I've attempted to capture the essence of her style while exploring the beauty of mathematics. The poem personifies mathematics as a source of beauty and wonder, comparable to the natural world that Dickinson often celebrated in her work.\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e2\u8868\u8fbe\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u4e4b\u7f8e\u7684\u8d5e\u8d4f\uff0c\u4e5f\u547c\u5e94\u4e86\u72c4\u91d1\u68ee\u8bd7\u6b4c\u4e2d\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5965\u79d8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\n"
