        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and we're given some information about who plays which sports. We need to find out how many students don't play any sport.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many boys and girls are in the class. The problem mentions boys and girls who play soccer and basketball, but it doesn't directly tell us the total number of boys and girls in the class. However, we can infer this from the given information.\n\nWe know there are 10 boys who play soccer and 5 girls who play soccer. Additionally, there are boys who don't play any sport, and 8 girls who play basketball but not soccer. Let's denote:\n\n- Total number of boys: B\n\n- Total number of girls: G\n\nWe know that B + G = 30, since there are 30 students in total.\n\nNow, among the boys:\n\n- 10 play soccer\n\n- Some boys don't play any sport\n\nLet's denote the number of boys who don't play any sport as B_ns.\n\nSo, B = 10 + B_ns\n\nSimilarly, among the girls:\n\n- 5 play soccer\n\n- 8 play basketball but not soccer\n\n- Possibly some girls don't play any sport\n\nLet's denote the number of girls who don't play any sport as G_ns.\n\nSo, G = 5 + 8 + G_ns = 13 + G_ns\n\nNow, since B + G = 30, we can substitute:\n\n(10 + B_ns) + (13 + G_ns) = 30\n\nSimplifying:\n\n23 + B_ns + G_ns = 30\n\nTherefore, B_ns + G_ns = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 students who don't play any sport.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this. Maybe there are overlapping categories or something I'm missing.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- 10 boys play soccer\n\n- 5 girls play soccer\n\n- Remaining boys don't play any sport\n\n- 8 girls play basketball but not soccer\n\nWe need to find who doesn't play any sport.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the total number of boys and girls.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nB = 10 + B_ns\n\nG = 5 + 8 + G_ns = 13 + G_ns\n\nAnd B + G = 30\n\nSo, (10 + B_ns) + (13 + G_ns) = 30\n\nB_ns + G_ns + 23 = 30\n\nThus, B_ns + G_ns = 7\n\nSo, 7 students don't play any sport.\n\nBut perhaps some girls play both soccer and basketball, but the problem says \"8 girls who play basketball but not soccer\", so these are separate groups.\n\nTherefore, the girls are divided into:\n\n- 5 play soccer only\n\n- 8 play basketball only\n\n- G_ns play no sport\n\nSimilarly, the boys are divided into:\n\n- 10 play soccer\n\n- B_ns play no sport\n\nNo mention is made of boys playing basketball, so we assume that only the girls play basketball.\n\nTherefore, our earlier calculation holds: B_ns + G_ns = 7 students don't play any sport.\n\nSo, the answer is 7 students don't play any sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
