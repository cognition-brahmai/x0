        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store selling apples and oranges. Apples are $1 each, and oranges are $2 each. A customer buys 5 fruits in total and spends exactly $8. We need to find out how many apples they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of apples.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the number of oranges.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of fruits is 5. So, \\( a + o = 5 \\).\n\n2. The total cost is $8. Since apples cost $1 each and oranges cost $2 each, the equation for the total cost is \\( 1a + 2o = 8 \\).\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( a + 2o = 8 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. I\u2019ll use the substitution method.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( a = 5 - o \\).\n\nNow, substitute \\( a \\) in the second equation:\n\n\\( (5 - o) + 2o = 8 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 5 - o + 2o = 8 \\)\n\n\\( 5 + o = 8 \\)\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\( o = 3 \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( o = 3 \\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\( a + 3 = 5 \\)\n\nSo, \\( a = 2 \\)\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 2 apples and 3 oranges.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check to make sure this is correct.\n\n- Number of fruits: 2 apples + 3 oranges = 5 fruits. That matches.\n\n- Total cost: (2 apples * $1) + (3 oranges * $2) = $2 + $6 = $8. That also matches.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says the customer buys 5 fruits and spends exactly $8. Our solution is 2 apples and 3 oranges, which satisfies both conditions. However, let\u2019s see if there are other possible solutions.\n\nIs there another combination of apples and oranges that adds up to 5 fruits and $8?\n\nLet\u2019s consider other possible values for \\( a \\) and \\( o \\):\n\n- If \\( a = 0 \\), then \\( o = 5 \\). Total cost would be 0*1 + 5*2 = $10, which is more than $8.\n\n- If \\( a = 1 \\), then \\( o = 4 \\). Total cost would be 1*1 + 4*2 = $1 + $8 = $9, still more than $8.\n\n- If \\( a = 2 \\), then \\( o = 3 \\). Total cost is $2 + $6 = $8. That works.\n\n- If \\( a = 3 \\), then \\( o = 2 \\). Total cost would be 3*1 + 2*2 = $3 + $4 = $7, which is less than $8.\n\n- If \\( a = 4 \\), then \\( o = 1 \\). Total cost would be 4*1 + 1*2 = $4 + $2 = $6, still less than $8.\n\n- If \\( a = 5 \\), then \\( o = 0 \\). Total cost would be 5*1 + 0*2 = $5, which is less than $8.\n\nSo, the only combination that meets both the total number of fruits and the total cost is 2 apples and 3 oranges.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"how many apples did they buy?\", implying that there might be multiple interpretations or tricks. Let me think again.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret the problem? Maybe the customer bought more than 5 fruits but somehow it\u2019s restricted to 5 fruits in total. No, it clearly says \"5 fruits.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are different types of oranges or apples, but no, the problem states apples and oranges with fixed prices.\n\nAnother thought: maybe some fruits are given for free or there are discounts, but the problem doesn\u2019t mention any.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer bought some fruits and returned some, but again, the problem doesn\u2019t suggest that.\n\nGiven that, our initial solution seems to be correct. The customer bought 2 apples and 3 oranges, spending exactly $8 on 5 fruits.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let\u2019s consider if there\u2019s any other possible combination that could satisfy both conditions.\n\nSuppose the customer buys 2 apples and 3 oranges, which is $8, as we calculated. Is there a way to buy 5 fruits and spend exactly $8 in another combination?\n\nLet\u2019s consider if perhaps some fruits are bought at a different price, but the problem states that apples are $1 each and oranges are $2 each, with no variations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer buys apples and oranges in a different ratio, but as we saw, only 2 apples and 3 oranges fit both the quantity and the price.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer buys more oranges and fewer apples, but as we saw, that would exceed the budget. Or buys more apples and fewer oranges, but that would not reach the $8.\n\nTherefore, the only possible combination is 2 apples and 3 oranges.\n\nBut the problem is asking for how many apples were bought, so the answer should be 2.\n\nHowever, to make sure, let\u2019s consider if there is any other possible interpretation of the problem.\n\nSuppose the customer buys 2 apples and 3 oranges, spending $8, but perhaps there is a tax or some other fee involved. But the problem doesn\u2019t mention any additional costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the prices are not fixed, but again, the problem states specific prices.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the customer buys the fruits in a bundle that has a different price, but again, the problem doesn\u2019t suggest any bundling.\n\nGiven that, I think our initial solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 2 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
