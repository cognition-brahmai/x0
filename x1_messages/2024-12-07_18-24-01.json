        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, 60% of the people have cats, and 40% have dogs. Also, among those who have cats, 30% also have dogs. I need to find out what percentage of the people in the town have both cats and dogs.\n\nFirst, I should probably define the total population as 100% for simplicity. So, 60% have cats, and 40% have dogs. Now, among the cat owners, 30% also have dogs. That means that 30% of the 60% cat owners also have dogs.\n\nTo find out what that is, I can calculate 30% of 60%. But I need to be careful with how I do that. Percentage of a percentage can be a bit tricky.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If I consider the cat owners as a group, which is 60% of the total population, and 30% of these cat owners also have dogs, then the percentage of the total population that has both cats and dogs would be 30% of 60%.\n\nSo, mathematically, that would be (30/100) * 60% = 18%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me verify.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use set theory. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let C be the set of cat owners.\n\n- Let D be the set of dog owners.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |C| = 60% of the population.\n\n- |D| = 40% of the population.\n\n- Among cat owners, 30% also have dogs, which means that 30% of C are also in D.\n\nSo, the intersection of C and D, which is |C \u2229 D|, is 30% of |C|.\n\nTherefore, |C \u2229 D| = 30% of 60% = 0.3 * 0.6 = 0.18, which is 18%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of probabilities. The probability that someone has both a cat and a dog is the probability that they have a cat multiplied by the probability that they have a dog given that they have a cat.\n\nSo, P(C and D) = P(C) * P(D|C).\n\nGiven that P(C) = 60% and P(D|C) = 30%, then P(C and D) = 60% * 30% = 18%.\n\nWait, but I remember that in probability, when multiplying percentages, it\u2019s actually multiplying decimals, so it\u2019s 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18, which is 18%.\n\nSo, according to this, 18% of the population has both cats and dogs.\n\nBut let me double-check if there\u2019s another way to approach this. Maybe using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states that |C \u222a D| = |C| + |D| - |C \u2229 D|.\n\nBut in this problem, I\u2019m not given the percentage of people who have either a cat or a dog or both. I\u2019m only given the percentages of cat owners and dog owners, and the percentage of cat owners who also have dogs.\n\nSo, perhaps that\u2019s not directly applicable here, unless I can make some assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the total percentage of dog ownership.\n\nWe know that 40% of the population has dogs, and among cat owners, 30% have dogs. But I need to see how these overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps I can set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total percentage of dog owners as the sum of those who only have dogs and those who have both cats and dogs.\n\nSimilarly, the total percentage of cat owners is those who only have cats plus those who have both.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know the percentages of only cat owners or only dog owners.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the given information to find the intersection directly.\n\nWait, actually, in my initial approach, I think I have it correct. The intersection is simply 30% of 60%, which is 18%.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I can consider the total number of people who have dogs.\n\nTotal dog owners are 40% of the population. Out of these, some have only dogs, and some have both cats and dogs.\n\nSimilarly, cat owners are 60%, and among them, 30% have dogs, which is 18% of the total population.\n\nSo, the number of people who have only dogs would be total dog owners minus those who have both, which is 40% - 18% = 22%.\n\nAnd the number of people who have only cats would be total cat owners minus those who have both, which is 60% - 18% = 42%.\n\nSo, in total, 42% have only cats, 22% have only dogs, and 18% have both, which adds up to 82%. That means 100% - 82% = 18% have neither cats nor dogs.\n\nBut that seems consistent. So, the percentage of people who have both cats and dogs is 18%.\n\nI think that\u2019s the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18\\%} \\]"
