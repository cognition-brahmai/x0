        "content": "So there's this problem here. In a class of 25 students, there are 12 boys and 13 girls. The teacher picks 3 students at random to form a group, and we need to find the probability that all three students are girls. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is picking 3 girls, and the total possible outcomes are all the different groups of 3 students that can be formed from the class.\n\nNow, to find the total number of possible outcomes, I need to figure out how many ways there are to choose 3 students out of 25. This is a combination problem because the order in which the students are picked doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) means factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, for the total number of possible groups, \\( n = 25 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25!}{3!(25 - 3)!} = \\frac{25!}{3! \\cdot 22!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 22! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22!}{3! \\times 22!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{6}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, \\( 25 \\times 24 = 600 \\),\n\nThen, \\( 600 \\times 23 = 13,800 \\),\n\nAnd finally, \\( 13,800 \\div 6 = 2,300 \\).\n\nSo, there are 2,300 possible groups of 3 students that can be formed from the class.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 13. Again, this is a combination problem:\n\n\\[\nC(13, 3) = \\frac{13!}{3!(13 - 3)!} = \\frac{13!}{3! \\cdot 10!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying by canceling out the \\( 10! \\):\n\n\\[\nC(13, 3) = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{3! \\times 10!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{3!}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( 3! = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\nC(13, 3) = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, \\( 13 \\times 12 = 156 \\),\n\nThen, \\( 156 \\times 11 = 1,716 \\),\n\nAnd finally, \\( 1,716 \\div 6 = 286 \\).\n\nSo, there are 286 ways to choose 3 girls from the 13 girls in the class.\n\nNow, the probability that all three students in the group are girls is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all girls}) = \\frac{C(13, 3)}{C(25, 3)} = \\frac{286}{2,300}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{286 \\div 2}{2,300 \\div 2} = \\frac{143}{1,150}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{143}{1,150} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal by dividing 143 by 1,150:\n\n\\[\n143 \\div 1,150 \\approx 0.1243\n\\]\n\nTo express it as a percentage, I multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n0.1243 \\times 100 \\approx 12.43\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 12.43%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, verifying \\( C(25, 3) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{6} = \\frac{13,800}{6} = 2,300\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, \\( C(13, 3) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(13, 3) = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{6} = \\frac{1,716}{6} = 286\n\\]\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nThen, the probability:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all girls}) = \\frac{286}{2,300} = \\frac{143}{1,150} \\approx 0.1243 \\text{ or } 12.43\\%\n\\]\n\nThis looks accurate.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the probability of picking a girl each time, without replacement, since the students are picked randomly and the order doesn't matter.\n\nThe probability of picking a girl first is \\( \\frac{13}{25} \\), since there are 13 girls out of 25 students.\n\nThen, given that the first student picked was a girl, there are now 12 girls left out of 24 students. So, the probability of picking another girl is \\( \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nFinally, given that the first two students picked were girls, there are 11 girls left out of 23 students. So, the probability of picking a third girl is \\( \\frac{11}{23} \\).\n\nTo find the overall probability of all three events happening, I multiply these probabilities together:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all girls}) = \\frac{13}{25} \\times \\frac{12}{24} \\times \\frac{11}{23}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{25} \\times \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{13}{25} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{13}{50}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{50} \\times \\frac{11}{23} = \\frac{13 \\times 11}{50 \\times 23} = \\frac{143}{1,150}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{143}{1,150} \\), or approximately 12.43%.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{143}{1150}} \\]"
