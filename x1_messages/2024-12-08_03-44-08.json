To find out how many miles light travels in one day, we need to calculate the total distance covered in 24 hours.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many seconds are in one day:\n\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n\n1 hour = 60 minutes \u00d7 60 seconds = 3,600 seconds\n\n1 day = 24 hours \u00d7 3,600 seconds = 86,400 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance light travels in one day:\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nDistance = 186,282 miles/second \u00d7 86,400 seconds\n\nDistance \u2248 16,094,512,320 miles\n\nSo, light travels approximately 16,094,512,320 miles in one day."
