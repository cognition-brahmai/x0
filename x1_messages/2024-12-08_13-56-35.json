        "content": "So the farmer has 15 acres of land and wants to plant corn on 60% of it. To find out how many acres that is, you need to calculate 60% of 15 acres.\n\nFirst, you can convert the percentage to a decimal. 60% is the same as 60 divided by 100, which is 0.6.\n\nSo, you multiply the total acres by this decimal:\n\n15 acres * 0.6 = 9 acres\n\nTherefore, the farmer will use 9 acres for planting corn.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
