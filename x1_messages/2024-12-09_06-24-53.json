How many spiders would be needed to reach a total of 1000 legs?\" Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We know that each spider has 8 legs, and we want to find out how many spiders we need to get a total of 1000 legs. This sounds like a division problem, where we divide the total number of legs by the number of legs per spider.\n\nSo, total legs desired is 1000, and each spider contributes 8 legs. Therefore, the number of spiders needed would be 1000 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 1000 \u00f7 8.\n\nWell, 8 times 125 is 1000, because 8 times 100 is 800, and 8 times 25 is 200, so 800 plus 200 is 1000.\n\nSo, 125 spiders would be needed to reach a total of 1000 legs.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If one spider has 8 legs, then 125 spiders would have 125 times 8 legs, which is indeed 1000 legs.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using multiplication or some other method to confirm.\n\nSuppose I let the number of spiders be x. Then, the total number of legs would be 8x, and we set that equal to 1000.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n8x = 1000\n\nTo solve for x, I divide both sides by 8:\n\nx = 1000 \u00f7 8\n\nAgain, x = 125\n\nSo, that confirms it.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using addition, but that would be impractical for such large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using factors or multiples.\n\nLet's see, 8 is 2 cubed, and 1000 is 10 cubed. But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that 8 goes into 1000 a certain number of times.\n\nLet me try another approach: how many legs does one spider have? 8.\n\nHow many legs do two spiders have? 16.\n\nSo, to get to 1000, we can keep adding 8 until we reach 1000, but that would take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can break it down into smaller parts.\n\nFor example, 100 spiders would have 800 legs, because 100 times 8 is 800.\n\nThen, I need 200 more legs to reach 1000.\n\nSince each spider has 8 legs, to get 200 legs, I can divide 200 by 8.\n\n200 \u00f7 8 is 25, because 8 times 25 is 200.\n\nSo, 100 spiders give me 800 legs, and 25 spiders give me 200 legs, totaling 125 spiders for 1000 legs.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nIs there any other consideration I should make? For example, do spiders always have 8 legs, or is there any variation?\n\nWell, generally, spiders have 8 legs, but there might be rare instances of deformity where a spider has fewer legs, but for the purposes of this problem, we can assume that all spiders have 8 legs.\n\nAlso, are there any constraints on the number of spiders, like a maximum or minimum number allowed? The problem doesn't specify any, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 125 spiders are needed to reach a total of 1000 legs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
