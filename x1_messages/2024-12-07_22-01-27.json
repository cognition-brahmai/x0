        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there's a factory that makes two kinds of products, A and B. They make $5 profit for each A they produce, and $8 for each B. Together, they produced 1000 units in total and made $6500 in profit. I need to find out how many of each they made.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a system of equations problem. I remember that when you have two variables, you need two equations to solve for them.\n\nLet me define the variables first:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n- Let x be the number of units of product A.\n\n- Let y be the number of units of product B.\n\nOkay, now, according to the problem:\n\n1. The total number of units produced is 1000. So, x + y = 1000.\n\n2. The total profit is $6500. Since each A brings $5 and each B brings $8, the profit equation would be 5x + 8y = 6500.\n\nSo, I have two equations:\n\n(1) x + y = 1000\n\n(2) 5x + 8y = 6500\n\nI need to solve for x and y.\n\nI can use the first equation to express one variable in terms of the other. Let\u2019s solve equation (1) for x:\n\nx = 1000 - y\n\nNow, plug this expression for x into equation (2):\n\n5(1000 - y) + 8y = 6500\n\nLet\u2019s expand that:\n\n5*1000 - 5y + 8y = 6500\n\nSo, 5000 - 5y + 8y = 6500\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n5000 + 3y = 6500\n\nNow, subtract 5000 from both sides:\n\n3y = 1500\n\nThen, divide both sides by 3:\n\ny = 500\n\nSo, the number of units of product B is 500.\n\nNow, plug y back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 1000 - y = 1000 - 500 = 500\n\nTherefore, the factory produced 500 units of product A and 500 units of product B.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf they produced 500 A's at $5 each, that's 500 * 5 = $2500.\n\nAnd 500 B's at $8 each, that's 500 * 8 = $4000.\n\nTotal profit would be $2500 + $4000 = $6500, which matches the total profit given.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if there's another way to solve this, maybe using substitution or elimination method.\n\nI already used substitution, but let's try the elimination method for practice.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n(1) x + y = 1000\n\n(2) 5x + 8y = 6500\n\nLet\u2019s try to eliminate one variable. I can multiply equation (1) by 5 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\n5(x + y) = 5(1000)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n5x + 5y = 5000\n\nNow, subtract this new equation from equation (2):\n\n(5x + 8y) - (5x + 5y) = 6500 - 5000\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3y = 1500\n\nThen, y = 500, just like before.\n\nThen, x = 1000 - 500 = 500.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have multiplied equation (1) by 8 instead:\n\n8(x + y) = 8(1000)\n\nWhich is:\n\n8x + 8y = 8000\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from this:\n\n(8x + 8y) - (5x + 8y) = 8000 - 6500\n\nThis gives:\n\n3x = 1500\n\nSo, x = 500\n\nThen, y = 1000 - 500 = 500\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. The key is to set up the equations correctly and then choose a method to solve them.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think about it logically.\n\nIf all 1000 units were product A, the total profit would be 1000 * 5 = $5000.\n\nBut the actual profit is $6500, which is $1500 more than $5000.\n\nSince each B brings an extra $3 in profit compared to A ($8 - $5 = $3), the number of B's can be found by dividing the extra profit by the extra profit per B.\n\nSo, number of B's = $1500 / $3 = 500.\n\nThen, number of A's = 1000 - 500 = 500.\n\nThis matches the previous results.\n\nThis method is faster, but it might not work for all problems, so it's good to know the algebraic methods as well.\n\nIn summary, the factory produced 500 units of product A and 500 units of product B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500 \\text{ units of product A and } 500 \\text{ units of product B}} \\]"
