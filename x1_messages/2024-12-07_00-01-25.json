        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 widgets per hour, and every third widget is defective. I need to find out how many non-defective widgets are produced in 6 hours.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total number of widgets produced in 6 hours. That should be straightforward:\n\nTotal widgets = production rate per hour \u00d7 number of hours\n\nSo, total widgets = 200 widgets/hour \u00d7 6 hours = 1200 widgets\n\nNow, every third widget is defective. So, to find out how many defective widgets there are, I can divide the total number of widgets by 3:\n\nDefective widgets = total widgets \u00f7 3 = 1200 \u00f7 3 = 400 widgets\n\nTherefore, the number of non-defective widgets should be the total widgets minus the defective ones:\n\nNon-defective widgets = total widgets - defective widgets = 1200 - 400 = 800 widgets\n\nWait a minute, does \"every third widget\" mean that exactly one out of every three widgets is defective? If that's the case, then my calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe I can consider that for every three widgets produced, two are non-defective. So, the ratio of non-defective widgets is 2/3.\n\nApplying this ratio to the total production:\n\nNon-defective widgets = (2/3) \u00d7 total widgets = (2/3) \u00d7 1200 = 800 widgets\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of non-defective widgets per hour and then multiply by the number of hours.\n\nNon-defective per hour = total per hour - defective per hour\n\nDefective per hour = 200 \u00f7 3 \u2248 66.67, but since we can't have a fraction of a widget, maybe I should consider it as 66 or 67 defective per hour. Wait, but this might complicate things, especially since we're dealing with a continuous production process, and the malfunction affects every third widget, regardless of the hour.\n\nI think my initial approach is better: calculate the total widgets produced in 6 hours and then determine the number of defective widgets by dividing by 3, and subtracting that from the total to get the non-defective count.\n\nSo, sticking with that, the number of non-defective widgets is 800.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Suppose the production is continuous and the malfunction affects every third widget uniformly. So, in a sequence of widgets, every third one is defective.\n\nFor example, if we have widgets numbered 1 to 1200, then widgets 3, 6, 9, ..., 1200 are defective.\n\nTo find out how many that is, we can divide 1200 by 3, which gives 400 defective widgets, same as before.\n\nTherefore, non-defective widgets are 1200 - 400 = 800.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to recognize that the defect pattern is periodic every three widgets. So, in every group of three widgets, two are non-defective.\n\nTherefore, the proportion of non-defective widgets is 2/3.\n\nApplying this to the total production: 2/3 \u00d7 1200 = 800.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI can also consider the production hour by hour.\n\nEach hour, 200 widgets are produced.\n\nNumber of defective widgets per hour = 200 \u00f7 3 \u2248 66.67.\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a widget, perhaps it's 66 or 67 defective per hour.\n\nBut over 6 hours, the total defective widgets would still average out to 400.\n\nBecause 200 \u00d7 6 = 1200 total widgets.\n\n1200 \u00f7 3 = 400 defective.\n\nSo, again, non-defective = 1200 - 400 = 800.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The answer should be 800 non-defective widgets produced in 6 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"
