Each step in your plan should be followed by an evidence value that corresponds to the output of one of the functions given an input string. This input can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information on the web. The function doesn't directly answer the question; it finds a list of sites that may have the answer.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from a webpage given its URL. The input is a link and the output is plain text containing the content of the page.\nQAEngine[input]: Answers questions based on common sense, general world knowledge, and given context that may contain the answer. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\nLinkPicker[input]: Picks the most relevant links from a set of URLs. The input is a newline-delimited string of URLs and the output is a single URL that seems most likely to contain the answer to the user's question.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action]\n:evidence0: = [function with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function with input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What was the cause of death of the famous painter Vincent van Gogh?"
