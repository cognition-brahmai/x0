        "content": "So the room is rectangular, with a length of 15 feet and a width of 10 feet. I need to figure out how many feet I'll have walked if I go around the perimeter twice.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the perimeter of the room is. I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides. So, for a rectangle, it's twice the length plus twice the width.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * length + 2 * width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * 15 + 2 * 10\n\nThat would be 30 + 20, which equals 50 feet.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the room is 50 feet.\n\nNow, since I'm walking around the perimeter twice, I need to multiply that perimeter by 2.\n\nTotal distance walked = 2 * perimeter\n\nSo, Total distance walked = 2 * 50 = 100 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the area or something else, but I think perimeter is the correct approach here because I'm walking around the edges of the room.\n\nLet me double-check the perimeter calculation. Length is 15 feet, width is 10 feet. So, one long side is 15 feet, one short side is 10 feet, then another 15 feet, and another 10 feet. Adding those up: 15 + 10 + 15 + 10 = 50 feet. Yes, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, walking around twice would indeed be twice the perimeter, so 2 * 50 = 100 feet.\n\nI think that's the answer: 100 feet.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of distance per lap and then multiply by the number of laps.\n\nEach lap around the perimeter is 50 feet, and I'm walking two laps, so 50 * 2 = 100 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total distance as the perimeter multiplied by the number of times I walk around, it's still 50 * 2 = 100 feet.\n\nI can't think of any reason why it would be different. So, I'm confident that 100 feet is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
