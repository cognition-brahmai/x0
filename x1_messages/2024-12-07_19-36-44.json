        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about an airline expanding its fleet. They're planning to buy 15 new aircraft with capacities from 150 to 300 passengers each. Their current load factor is 75%, but they want to increase that to 85% with these new planes. I need to estimate the total number of additional passengers they can accommodate per year with these new aircraft, and they're assuming an average of 5 flights per day for each plane.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. They want to know how many more passengers the airline can carry per year after adding these 15 new planes, considering the increase in load factor.\n\nOkay, so let's break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the average capacity of the new aircraft.\n\nThe capacities range from 150 to 300 passengers. Assuming that the capacities are uniformly distributed between 150 and 300, the average capacity would be the midpoint of this range.\n\nAverage capacity = (150 + 300) / 2 = 450 / 2 = 225 passengers per aircraft.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of passengers each new aircraft can carry per flight at the new load factor.\n\nThe new load factor is 85%, so each aircraft will carry 85% of its capacity.\n\nPassengers per flight = average capacity * load factor = 225 * 0.85 = 191.25 passengers.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a passenger, I'll round this to 191 passengers per flight.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of flights per year per aircraft.\n\nThey're assuming 5 flights per day. There are 365 days in a year, so:\n\nFlights per year per aircraft = 5 flights/day * 365 days/year = 1,825 flights/year.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the annual passenger capacity per new aircraft.\n\nAnnual passengers per aircraft = passengers per flight * flights per year = 191 * 1,825 \u2248 349,175 passengers/year.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total annual passenger capacity for all 15 new aircraft.\n\nTotal annual passengers = annual passengers per aircraft * number of aircraft = 349,175 * 15 \u2248 5,237,625 passengers/year.\n\nStep 6: Determine the additional passengers compared to the current situation.\n\nBut wait, the current load factor is 75%, and they're increasing it to 85%. So, I need to find out how much of an increase this represents.\n\nFirst, find the current passenger capacity with the old load factor.\n\nCurrent passengers per flight = average capacity * current load factor = 225 * 0.75 = 168.75 \u2248 169 passengers per flight.\n\nCurrent annual passengers per aircraft = 169 * 1,825 \u2248 308,125 passengers/year.\n\nTotal current annual passengers for 15 aircraft = 308,125 * 15 \u2248 4,621,875 passengers/year.\n\nNow, the new total annual passengers are 5,237,625 passengers/year.\n\nSo, the additional passengers are:\n\n5,237,625 - 4,621,875 = 615,750 passengers/year.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Because they're not replacing the old aircraft; they're adding new ones. So, perhaps I shouldn't be subtracting the current capacity.\n\nLet me rethink this.\n\nIf they are adding 15 new aircraft to their existing fleet, then the additional passengers would be solely from these new aircraft at the new load factor.\n\nBut the problem says \"additional passengers the airline can accommodate per year with the new aircraft,\" which suggests that it's the capacity added by the new aircraft alone.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I don't need to subtract the current capacity.\n\nBut then, why mention the current load factor?\n\nMaybe I need to consider the increase in load factor for the new aircraft only.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current load factor is for the entire fleet, and with the new aircraft, they aim to increase the overall load factor to 85%.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the new aircraft will operate at 85% load factor, while the existing fleet continues at 75%.\n\nBut I don't have data on the existing fleet size.\n\nActually, the problem says \"the airline's current load factor is 75%, but they aim to increase it to 85% with the new planes.\"\n\nSo, it seems like the new planes are expected to operate at 85% load factor, and this will help raise the overall load factor of the entire fleet to 85%.\n\nBut without knowing the size of the existing fleet, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intention is to calculate the capacity of the new aircraft at 85% load factor, and consider that as the additional passengers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the simplest approach is to calculate the annual passenger capacity of the 15 new aircraft at 85% load factor, and consider that as the additional capacity.\n\nThat would be the 5,237,625 passengers/year from the new aircraft.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's what they're asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want the increase in passengers due to both the addition of new aircraft and the increase in load factor.\n\nWait for the existing fleet, we don't have data, so maybe we should assume that the existing fleet remains the same, and the new aircraft are operated at 85% load factor.\n\nIn that case, the additional passengers would indeed be the capacity of the new aircraft at 85% load factor.\n\nSo, 5,237,625 passengers/year.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose the existing fleet has a certain number of aircraft, and they're operating at 75% load factor.\n\nBy adding 15 new aircraft operating at 85% load factor, the overall load factor of the entire fleet becomes 85%.\n\nBut without knowing the size of the existing fleet, this is difficult to calculate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intention is to calculate the additional passengers purely based on the increase in load factor for the new aircraft.\n\nIn other words, what's the difference in passengers per flight due to the increase in load factor from 75% to 85%, and then scale that up to yearly figures.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, find the passengers per flight at 75% load factor: 225 * 0.75 = 168.75 \u2248 169 passengers.\n\nAt 85% load factor: 225 * 0.85 = 191.25 \u2248 191 passengers.\n\nSo, the increase per flight is 191 - 169 = 22 passengers.\n\nThen, per aircraft per year: 22 passengers flight * 1,825 flights/year = 40,150 passengers/year.\n\nFor 15 aircraft: 40,150 * 15 = 602,250 passengers/year.\n\nWait, this is similar to what I calculated earlier as the difference.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that wasn't right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is the correct additional passengers due to the increase in load factor.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nIf the new aircraft are operated at 85% load factor, and the existing fleet is operated at 75% load factor, and we're adding 15 new aircraft, then the additional passengers would be the sum of:\n\n1. The capacity of the new aircraft at 85% load factor.\n\n2. Plus the increase in load factor for the existing fleet.\n\nBut again, without knowing the size of the existing fleet, I can't calculate the second part.\n\nPerhaps the assumption is that the existing fleet remains unchanged, and only the new aircraft are added at 85% load factor.\n\nIn that case, the additional passengers would indeed be the capacity of the new aircraft at 85% load factor, which is 5,237,625 passengers/year.\n\nAlternatively, if the existing fleet is also increased to 85% load factor, then I need to account for that as well.\n\nBut the problem says \"the airline's current load factor is 75%, but they aim to increase it to 85% with the new planes.\"\n\nThis suggests that the new planes are what will help increase the overall load factor to 85%.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to calculate the total additional passengers such that the overall load factor becomes 85%.\n\nThis seems complicated without knowing the existing fleet size.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to calculate the additional passengers purely based on the new aircraft at 85% load factor, without considering the existing fleet.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be approximately 5,237,625 passengers per year.\n\nBut I feel like I'm missing something here.\n\nMaybe I should consider the average capacity more carefully.\n\nThe capacities range from 150 to 300 passengers, and assuming a uniform distribution, the average is 225.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different distribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the minimum and maximum capacities to provide a range for the additional passengers.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, calculate the annual passengers for the minimum capacity:\n\nCapacity = 150 passengers.\n\nPassengers per flight at 85% load factor: 150 * 0.85 = 127.5 \u2248 128 passengers.\n\nFlights per year: 5 * 365 = 1,825.\n\nAnnual passengers per aircraft: 128 * 1,825 \u2248 233,200 passengers/year.\n\nFor 15 aircraft: 233,200 * 15 \u2248 3,498,000 passengers/year.\n\nSimilarly, for maximum capacity:\n\nCapacity = 300 passengers.\n\nPassengers per flight at 85% load factor: 300 * 0.85 = 255 passengers.\n\nAnnual passengers per aircraft: 255 * 1,825 \u2248 465,375 passengers/year.\n\nFor 15 aircraft: 465,375 * 15 \u2248 6,980,625 passengers/year.\n\nSo, the additional passengers per year would be between 3,498,000 and 6,980,625 passengers.\n\nBut earlier, using the average capacity, I got approximately 5,237,625 passengers/year.\n\nPerhaps providing a range would be more accurate, considering the varying capacities.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume that the capacities are uniformly distributed between 150 and 300, then using the average capacity of 225 is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the additional passengers per year would be around 5,237,625 passengers.\n\nBut to make it more precise, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation without rounding intermediate steps.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nAverage capacity: (150 + 300)/2 = 225 passengers.\n\nLoad factor: 85% \u2192 0.85.\n\nPassengers per flight: 225 * 0.85 = 191.25 passengers.\n\nFlights per year per aircraft: 5 * 365 = 1,825 flights/year.\n\nAnnual passengers per aircraft: 191.25 * 1,825 = 349,140.625 passengers/year.\n\nFor 15 aircraft: 349,140.625 * 15 = 5,237,109.375 passengers/year.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number: 5,237,109 passengers/year.\n\nSo, the airline can accommodate approximately 5,237,109 additional passengers per year with the new aircraft.\n\nBut considering the earlier approach where I calculated the increase in passengers due to the higher load factor, I got around 602,250 passengers/year.\n\nI think that approach is incorrect because that would only account for the difference in load factor for the new aircraft, not the entire capacity of the new aircraft.\n\nThe new aircraft are being added to the fleet, so their entire capacity (at the new load factor) represents additional passengers.\n\nTherefore, the first approach is more accurate.\n\nSo, the final answer should be approximately 5,237,109 passengers per year.\n\nAlternatively, to present it in a more readable format, about 5.24 million passengers per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5237109} \\]"
