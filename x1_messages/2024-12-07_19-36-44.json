        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a bee lands on a flower every 10 seconds and stays for 5 seconds before flying off. I need to figure out how many bees land on the flower in one minute. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that one minute is 60 seconds. So, the total time we're considering is 60 seconds.\n\nNow, a bee lands every 10 seconds. So, to find out how many times a bee lands in 60 seconds, I can divide 60 by 10.\n\n60 \u00f7 10 = 6\n\nSo, at first glance, it seems like 6 bees land on the flower in one minute.\n\nBut wait a minute, I need to consider the time each bee spends on the flower. Each bee stays for 5 seconds before flying off. Does this affect the number of bees landing?\n\nLet me think about this. If a bee lands every 10 seconds, and each stays for 5 seconds, is there any overlap where multiple bees are on the flower at the same time?\n\nLet's try to visualize this.\n\nImagine time progresses in seconds:\n\n- At t=0 seconds: Bee 1 lands and stays until t=5 seconds.\n\n- At t=10 seconds: Bee 2 lands and stays until t=15 seconds.\n\n- At t=20 seconds: Bee 3 lands and stays until t=25 seconds.\n\n- At t=30 seconds: Bee 4 lands and stays until t=35 seconds.\n\n- At t=40 seconds: Bee 5 lands and stays until t=45 seconds.\n\n- At t=50 seconds: Bee 6 lands and stays until t=55 seconds.\n\n- At t=60 seconds: Would there be another bee landing? Wait, since our time frame is up to t=60 seconds, and bees land every 10 seconds, starting at t=0.\n\nBut let's confirm: does the first bee land at t=0 or t=10?\n\nActually, the problem says \"every 10 seconds,\" so the landing times would be at t=0, t=10, t=20, t=30, t=40, t=50, and t=60 seconds.\n\nWait a second, that's 7 landings: at t=0, t=10, t=20, t=30, t=40, t=50, and t=60.\n\nBut earlier I only counted 6. Let me recount.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=60, inclusive, every 10 seconds:\n\nt=0: Bee 1\n\nt=10: Bee 2\n\nt=20: Bee 3\n\nt=30: Bee 4\n\nt=40: Bee 5\n\nt=50: Bee 6\n\nt=60: Bee 7\n\nSo, actually, 7 bees land on the flower within the one-minute period.\n\nBut now, I need to consider whether the bee landing at t=60 would complete its 5-second stay within the one-minute frame.\n\nThe bee landing at t=60 would stay until t=65 seconds.\n\nBut our time frame is only up to t=60 seconds. So, does that count?\n\nThis is a bit tricky. The problem asks for the number of bees that land on the flower in one minute.\n\nIf we consider that the landing happens at t=60 seconds, but the stay extends beyond t=60 seconds, do we still count that bee?\n\nI think the key here is the landing event. If the bee lands within the one-minute period, regardless of when it flies off, it should be counted.\n\nSo, in this case, all 7 bees land within the one-minute period, even if they stay beyond t=60 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7 bees.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nTotal time: 60 seconds.\n\nLanding interval: every 10 seconds.\n\nLandings at: t=0, t=10, t=20, t=30, t=40, t=50, t=60.\n\nThat's 7 landings.\n\nEach stay: 5 seconds.\n\nDoes the stay time affect the count? The problem asks for the number of bees that land in one minute, not the number present at any given time.\n\nSo, even if some bees are still there beyond t=60 seconds, as long as they landed within the one-minute period, they should be counted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 7 bees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
