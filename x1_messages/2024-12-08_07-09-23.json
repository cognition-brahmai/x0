        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the garden has a length of 20 meters and a width of 15 meters. I need to find two things: first, the area of the garden, and second, the length of the diagonal. Okay, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. Given that the length is 20 meters and the width is 15 meters, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = 20 meters * 15 meters = 300 square meters.\n\nSo, the area of the garden is 300 square meters.\n\nNext, I need to find the length of the diagonal. In a rectangle, the diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with the length and the width. So, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (which is the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the rectangle).\n\nSo, the formula for the diagonal (let's call it d) is:\n\nd = sqrt(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nd = sqrt(20\u00b2 + 15\u00b2) = sqrt(400 + 225) = sqrt(625) = 25 meters.\n\nTherefore, the length of the diagonal is 25 meters.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Area: 300 square meters\n\n- Diagonal: 25 meters\n\nI think that's it. If there's anything else I need to consider, please let me know."
