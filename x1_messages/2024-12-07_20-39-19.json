        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's break it down step by step. We have a group of 50 people, divided into vegetarians and non-vegetarians. There are 20 vegetarians and 30 non-vegetarians. Among the vegetarians, 12 prefer spicy food, and among the non-vegetarians, 18 prefer spicy food. We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen person is a vegetarian who prefers spicy food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is selecting a vegetarian who prefers spicy food.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of people in the group, which is 50.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of vegetarians who prefer spicy food, which is 12.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 12 divided by 50.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nProbability = Number of vegetarians who prefer spicy food / Total number of people\n\nProbability = 12 / 50\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\n12 \u00f7 2 = 6\n\n50 \u00f7 2 = 25\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 6/25.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal. Let's see:\n\n6 divided by 25 is 0.24.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.24, or 24%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this problem differently to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the probabilities step by step. First, the probability of selecting a vegetarian, and then, given that they are vegetarian, the probability that they prefer spicy food.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a vegetarian is:\n\nNumber of vegetarians / Total number of people = 20 / 50 = 2/5 = 0.4\n\nNow, given that the person is a vegetarian, the probability that they prefer spicy food is:\n\nNumber of vegetarians who prefer spicy food / Total number of vegetarians = 12 / 20 = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nThen, the combined probability of both events (selecting a vegetarian and that vegetarian preferring spicy food) is:\n\nProbability = (Probability of selecting a vegetarian) \u00d7 (Probability that they prefer spicy food given they are vegetarian)\n\nProbability = 0.4 \u00d7 0.6 = 0.24\n\nSo, again, I get 0.24 or 24%.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, which is a good sign. It looks like 0.24 is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the information about non-vegetarians. Although it's not directly needed for this particular problem, it might be useful if the question were different.\n\nWe know that among non-vegetarians, 18 prefer spicy food. So, the number of non-vegetarians who prefer spicy food is 18, and the total number of non-vegetarians is 30.\n\nIf we were to find the probability that a randomly selected person is a non-vegetarian who prefers spicy food, it would be:\n\nNumber of non-vegetarians who prefer spicy food / Total number of people = 18 / 50 = 0.36 or 36%.\n\nBut since the question is only about vegetarians who prefer spicy food, we don't need this information for the current problem.\n\nHowever, it's good to verify that all the numbers make sense. Let's check the total number of people who prefer spicy food.\n\nTotal number of people who prefer spicy food = Number of vegetarians who prefer spicy food + Number of non-vegetarians who prefer spicy food = 12 + 18 = 30.\n\nSo, out of 50 people, 30 prefer spicy food, which is consistent.\n\nJust to summarize, the probability that a randomly selected person is a vegetarian who prefers spicy food is 12/50, which simplifies to 6/25 or 0.24.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.24} \\]"
