        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. In a town, 60% of the population is male and 40% is female. Among the males, 30% are left-handed, and among the females, 20% are left-handed. I need to find out what percentage of the total population is left-handed.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I have the percentages of males and females in the town, and I have the percentages of left-handed people within each group. I need to find the overall percentage of left-handed people in the entire population.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use the concept of weighted averages because the percentages are weighted by the proportions of males and females in the population.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- Total population = 100% for simplicity.\n\n- Males = 60% of total population.\n\n- Females = 40% of total population.\n\nNow, among males, 30% are left-handed. So, the percentage of the total population that are left-handed males would be 60% times 30%.\n\nSimilarly, among females, 20% are left-handed. So, the percentage of the total population that are left-handed females would be 40% times 20%.\n\nThen, to find the total percentage of left-handed people in the population, I can add these two quantities together.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, left-handed males:\n\n60% of total population * 30% = 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18, which is 18%.\n\nNext, left-handed females:\n\n40% of total population * 20% = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08, which is 8%.\n\nNow, total left-handed population = left-handed males + left-handed females = 18% + 8% = 26%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of actual numbers. Let's assume a total population of 1000 people for easier calculation.\n\n- Males: 60% of 1000 = 600 males.\n\n- Females: 40% of 1000 = 400 females.\n\nNow, left-handed males: 30% of 600 = 0.3 * 600 = 180.\n\nLeft-handed females: 20% of 400 = 0.2 * 400 = 80.\n\nTotal left-handed people: 180 + 80 = 260.\n\nPercentage of left-handed people in the total population: (260 / 1000) * 100% = 26%.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems consistent.\n\nIs there any other approach I can use to verify this?\n\nMaybe using probabilities. The probability that a randomly selected person is left-handed can be found using the law of total probability.\n\nP(left-handed) = P(left-handed | male) * P(male) + P(left-handed | female) * P(female)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(left-handed) = (0.3)(0.6) + (0.2)(0.4) = 0.18 + 0.08 = 0.26, or 26%.\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me more confidence that 26% is the correct answer.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe considering that some people might be left-handed regardless of gender, but according to the problem, the left-handed percentages are given within each gender group, so I think the approach I've taken is correct.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I haven't made any calculation errors. Let's redo the multiplications.\n\n60% * 30% = 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18 \u2192 18%\n\n40% * 20% = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 \u2192 8%\n\nTotal: 18% + 8% = 26%.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use a contingency table or a tree diagram, I think I would arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nSo, I believe the percentage of the total population that is left-handed is 26%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26\\%} \\]"
