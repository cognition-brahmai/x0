        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a square garden with an area of 144 square meters, and I need to figure out how much fencing I'll need to go around it. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since it's a square garden, all sides are equal in length. The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one side, right? So, if the area is 144 square meters, that means side length squared equals 144. Mathematically, that's s^2 = 144, where s is the length of one side.\n\nTo find s, I need to take the square root of both sides. The square root of 144 is 12. So, each side of the square garden is 12 meters long.\n\nNow, to find out how much fencing is needed to go around the entire garden, I need to calculate the perimeter of the square. The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since all sides are equal, it's 4 times the length of one side.\n\nSo, perimeter P = 4 * s = 4 * 12 = 48 meters.\n\nTherefore, you would need 48 meters of fencing to enclose the entire garden.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Starting with the area, s^2 = 144, s = 12 meters. Perimeter is 4 times side, so 4 * 12 = 48 meters. Yeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using the formula for the area and perimeter directly. Area A = s^2, perimeter P = 4s. Given A = 144, find s, then find P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the diagonal of the square, but that seems more complicated and unnecessary here since we're given the area and need the perimeter.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes problems might have tricks or additional considerations, like the garden having a path around it or something, but in this case, it's straightforward. It's just a square garden with a given area, and we need the perimeter.\n\nSo, my final answer is 48 meters of fencing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
