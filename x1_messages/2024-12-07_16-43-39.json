        "content": "Let's see. The company has a monthly budget of $10,000 for employee salaries. They spend 35% of this budget on full-time employees, and the rest is spent on part-time employees. I need to find out how much money is spent on part-time employees.\n\nFirst, I should find out how much is spent on full-time employees. Since they spend 35% of the $10,000 on full-time employees, I can calculate that by multiplying 10,000 by 35%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky. I remember that to find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply. So, 35% is the same as 0.35 in decimal form.\n\nSo, the amount spent on full-time employees is:\n\n10,000 * 0.35 = 3,500\n\nSo, $3,500 is spent on full-time employees.\n\nNow, the rest of the budget is spent on part-time employees. Since the total budget is $10,000, I can find the amount spent on part-time employees by subtracting the amount spent on full-time employees from the total budget.\n\nSo, it would be:\n\n10,000 - 3,500 = 6,500\n\nTherefore, $6,500 is spent on part-time employees.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage spent on part-time employees directly.\n\nIf 35% is spent on full-time employees, then the remaining percentage spent on part-time employees is 100% - 35% = 65%.\n\nSo, I can also find 65% of $10,000 to get the amount spent on part-time employees.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n65% of 10,000 is:\n\n10,000 * 0.65 = 6,500\n\nSo, again, $6,500 is spent on part-time employees.\n\nBoth methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. It confirms that $6,500 is the correct amount spent on part-time employees.\n\nI think that's straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I correctly converted the percentage to a decimal: 35% is 0.35.\n\nThen, I multiplied the budget by this decimal to find the full-time employees' salary: 10,000 * 0.35 = 3,500.\n\nNext, I subtracted this amount from the total budget to find the part-time employees' salary: 10,000 - 3,500 = 6,500.\n\nAlternatively, I calculated the direct percentage for part-time employees: 65% of 10,000 is 6,500.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the company spends $6,500 on part-time employees each month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6500} \\]"
