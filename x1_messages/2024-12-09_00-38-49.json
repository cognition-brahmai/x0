        "content": "Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his services to theoretical physics, and in particular for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material when light shines on it, and Einstein's work provided a theoretical foundation for this observation, which was crucial for the development of quantum theory.\n\nHowever, in the input you provided, there seems to be some confusion about Einstein's achievements. According to the Nobel Prize website, Einstein was indeed born on March 14, 1879 (not May 14, 1887), and he was a physicist, not a chemist. He is famous for his theory of relativity and significant contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. The laws of thermodynamics were formulated by others, such as Rudolf Clausius, Sadi Carnot, and Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein's work had profound impacts on physics, not specifically on biology. Additionally, he did not develop the periodic table; that was the work of Dmitri Mendeleev.\n\nIt's important to refer to accurate sources when discussing historical figures and their contributions. The Nobel Prize website is a reliable source for information about Nobel laureates and their achievements.\n\n**Source:**\n\n- [Albert Einstein - Facts](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/einstein/facts/)"
