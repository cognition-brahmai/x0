Let me think of a better one.\n\nHere's a joke about job interviews:\n\nWhy did the candidate bring a ladder to the interview?\n\nBecause he wanted to look more impressive!\n\nHaha, get it? \"Look more impressive\" \u2013 meaning to seem taller or something like that. It's a bit of a stretch, but I hope you\u7b11.\n\nAnother one:\n\nWhy was the job interview so stressful?\n\nBecause the candidate kept forgetting to breathe and just kept selling air!\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me try again.\n\nWhy was the job interview so short?\n\nBecause the candidate went on and on about his previous job as a talking parrot!\n\nHmm, maybe not the best joke ever. How about this:\n\nWhy did the candidate bring a deck of cards to the interview?\n\nTo be prepared for any question, even if it was a curveball!\n\nAlright, maybe these aren't the funniest jokes, but I hope they bring a smile to your face. If you have any other requests or topics you'd like jokes about, feel free to ask!"
