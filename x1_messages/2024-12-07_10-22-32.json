        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a rectangular room has an area of 180 square feet and a width of 12 feet. I need to find out what the length of the room is. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width, or A = L \u00d7 W. In this case, I'm given the area (A = 180 sq ft) and the width (W = 12 ft), and I need to find the length (L).\n\nSo, plugging in the values I have:\n\n180 = L \u00d7 12\n\nNow, I need to solve for L. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 12.\n\nL = 180 \u00f7 12\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n12 goes into 18 once, that's 12, subtract from 18, leaves 6. Bring down the 0, makes it 60. 12 goes into 60 five times exactly. So, L = 15 feet.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. If the width is 12 feet and the length is 15 feet, then the area should be 12 \u00d7 15 = 180 square feet, which matches what's given. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to think about it. Sometimes, units can tricky, but here it's straightforward\u2014everything's in feet and square feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to visualize this, imagine a rectangle where one side is 12 feet, and the adjacent side is the length I'm trying to find. The space inside this rectangle is 180 square feet.\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a rectangle is definitely the way to go. I don't see any complexities here like irregular shapes or anything like that.\n\nSo, the answer should be 15 feet.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of multiple answers. For a rectangle, given the area and one dimension, the other dimension is uniquely determined by the area formula. So, only one possible length in this case.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent, which they are\u2014everything's in feet and square feet.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
