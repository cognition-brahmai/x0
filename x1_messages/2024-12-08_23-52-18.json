Below is a Python script that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a directed, weighted graph.\n\nFirst, we'll need to represent the graph. For this example, we'll use a dictionary where keys are nodes, and values are lists of tuples representing outgoing edges with their weights.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Use a dictionary where each key is a node, and its value is a list of tuples, each containing a neighboring node and the weight of the edge to that neighbor.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue to always expand the least costly node first. In Python, we can use the `heapq` module for this purpose.\n\n3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize distances to all nodes as infinite, except the start node, which is 0.\n   - Use a priority queue to keep track of nodes to visit, starting with the start node.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue the node with the smallest distance, and update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Keep track of the previous node in the shortest path to reconstruct the path once the end node is reached.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start, end):\n    # Priority queue to hold nodes to visit, with their distances\n    queue = []\n    heapq.heappush(queue, (0, start))\n    \n    # Dictionary to store the shortest distance to each node\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    \n    # Dictionary to store the previous node in the shortest path\n    previous_nodes = {node: None for node in graph}\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Get the node with the smallest distance\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        \n        # Nodes can be added to the queue multiple times with different distances\n        # We only process a node once, when it's first removed from the queue\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if we've reached the end node\n        if current_node == end:\n            path = []\n            while current_node is not None:\n                path.insert(0, current_node)\n                current_node = previous_nodes[current_node]\n            return path, distances[end]\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:\n            distance = current_distance + weight\n            \n            # Only consider this new path if it's better\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))\n    \n    # If end is not reachable\n    return None, float('infinity')\n\n# Example usage:\ngraph = {\n    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],\n    'B': [('C', 2), ('D', 5)],\n    'C': [('D', 1)],\n    'D': []\n}\n\nstart_node = 'A'\nend_node = 'D'\n\npath, distance = dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node)\n\nif path:\n    print(f\"Shortest path from {start_node} to {end_node}: {' -> '.join(path)}\")\n    print(f\"Distance: {distance}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"No path found from {start_node} to {end_node}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**:\n   - The graph is represented as a dictionary where keys are nodes ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D'), and values are lists of tuples. Each tuple contains a neighboring node and the weight of the edge to that neighbor.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**:\n   - We use a heap queue to always process the node with the smallest distance first.\n\n3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n   - We maintain a dictionary to keep track of the shortest known distance to each node from the start node.\n   - Another dictionary keeps track of the previous node in the shortest path to help reconstruct the path once the end node is reached.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Once the end node is dequeued, we backtrack from the end node to the start node using the `previous_nodes` dictionary to construct the shortest path.\n\nThis script provides a clear and efficient way to find the shortest path in a directed, weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm."
