        "content": "So you've got a square garden, and each side is 10 meters long. You want to know how far you'll walk if you go all the way around it, right? Well, a square has four sides, and since they're all the same length, you can just add up all the sides to get the total distance.\n\nSo, if one side is 10 meters, then four sides would be 10 meters plus 10 meters plus 10 meters plus 10 meters. That's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10, which equals 40 meters.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides are equal, you can multiply the length of one side by the number of sides. So, 10 meters times 4 equals 40 meters.\n\nTherefore, if you walk around the entire perimeter of the garden, you will have walked 40 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
