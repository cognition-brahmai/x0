        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of pens: pen A costs $1.50 each, and pen B costs $2.00 each. The customer buys a total of 20 pens and spends exactly $35. We need to find out how many of each type of pen they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of pen A's bought.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of pen B's bought.\n\nNow, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of pens bought is 20.\n\n2. The total amount spent is $35.\n\nWe can translate these into two equations based on the variables we've defined.\n\nThe first equation comes from the total number of pens:\n\n\\[ x + y = 20 \\]\n\nThe second equation comes from the total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50x + 2.00y = 35 \\]\n\nSo, now we have a system of two equations with two variables, which we can solve.\n\nLet's look at the first equation:\n\n\\[ x + y = 20 \\]\n\nWe can solve this for one of the variables, say \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 20 - y \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 1.50(20 - y) + 2.00y = 35 \\]\n\nLet's carry out the multiplication:\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 20 = 30 \\]\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times (-y) = -1.50y \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 30 - 1.50y + 2.00y = 35 \\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[ 30 + (2.00y - 1.50y) = 35 \\]\n\n\\[ 30 + 0.50y = 35 \\]\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.50y = 5 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.50 to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{5}{0.50} \\]\n\n\\[ y = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 10 pen B's.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 20 - y \\]\n\n\\[ x = 20 - 10 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 10 pen A's and 10 pen B's.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it adds up.\n\nFirst, total number of pens:\n\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nChecks out.\n\nNext, total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 10 = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ 2.00 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ 15 + 20 = 35 \\]\n\nPerfect, it matches the given total cost.\n\nSo, the answer is 10 pen A's and 10 pen B's.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ pen A's and } 10 \\text{ pen B's}} \\]"
