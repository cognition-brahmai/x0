        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 6 yellow marbles. So, total marbles in the bag are 4 + 5 + 6, which is 15 marbles. The problem is about drawing 3 marbles from the bag without replacement, and we need to find the probability that at least one of those marbles is red.\n\nOkay, so the phrase \"at least one\" often suggests that it might be easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be drawing 3 marbles with none of them being red. So, the probability of at least one red marble would be 1 minus the probability of drawing no red marbles in 3 draws.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles out of 15. That's the combination of 15 marbles taken 3 at a time, which is denoted as C(15, 3). The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSo, C(15, 3) = 15! / (3! * (15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455.\n\nNext, find the number of ways to draw 3 marbles that are not red. Since there are 4 red marbles, the number of non-red marbles is 15 - 4 = 11. So, the number of ways to draw 3 non-red marbles is C(11, 3).\n\nC(11, 3) = 11! / (3! * (11 - 3)!) = (11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 165.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing no red marbles is the number of ways to draw 3 non-red marbles divided by the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles, which is 165 / 455.\n\nSimplifying that fraction, 165 \u00f7 5 = 33, and 455 \u00f7 5 = 91, so it's 33/91.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing at least one red marble is 1 - 33/91.\n\nTo subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. 1 can be written as 91/91, so 91/91 - 33/91 = 58/91.\n\nSo, the probability is 58/91.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the probability directly, considering the different scenarios where we have exactly one red marble, exactly two red marbles, or exactly three red marbles, and then sum those probabilities.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing exactly one red marble.\n\nThis would be the number of ways to choose 1 red marble out of 4 and 2 non-red marbles out of 11, divided by the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 15.\n\nSo, C(4, 1) * C(11, 2) / C(15, 3).\n\nC(4, 1) = 4.\n\nC(11, 2) = (11 \u00d7 10) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 55.\n\nSo, 4 * 55 = 220.\n\nDivided by C(15, 3) = 455, so 220/455.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of exactly two red marbles:\n\nC(4, 2) * C(11, 1) / C(15, 3).\n\nC(4, 2) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 6.\n\nC(11, 1) = 11.\n\nSo, 6 * 11 = 66.\n\nDivided by 455, so 66/455.\n\nAnd the probability of exactly three red marbles:\n\nC(4, 3) * C(11, 0) / C(15, 3).\n\nC(4, 3) = 4.\n\nC(11, 0) = 1.\n\nSo, 4 * 1 = 4.\n\nDivided by 455, so 4/455.\n\nNow, sum these probabilities: 220/455 + 66/455 + 4/455 = 290/455.\n\nSimplify 290/455: divide numerator and denominator by 5, get 58/91.\n\nSo, that matches the earlier result of 58/91.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use probability multiplication for without replacement.\n\nThe probability that the first marble is not red is 11/15.\n\nThen, given that the first was not red, the probability that the second is not red is 10/14.\n\nThen, given that the first two were not red, the probability that the third is not red is 9/13.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing no red marbles is (11/15) * (10/14) * (9/13).\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, 11/15 * 10/14 = (11 * 10) / (15 * 14) = 110 / 210 = 11/21.\n\nThen, 11/21 * 9/13 = (11 * 9) / (21 * 13) = 99 / 273.\n\nSimplify 99/273: divide numerator and denominator by 3, get 33/91.\n\nAgain, that matches the earlier result of 33/91 for no red marbles.\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least one red marble is 1 - 33/91 = 58/91.\n\nAlternatively, using the direct approach, we get the same result of 58/91.\n\nSo, the final answer is 58/91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{58}{91}} \\]"
