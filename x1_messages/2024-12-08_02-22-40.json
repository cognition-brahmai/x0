        "content": "I'm going to try to decipher this riddle. So, there's a horrid monster that hides from the day, which suggests it's nocturnal or\u6015\u5149\u7684. It has many legs and many eyes, which might indicate it's some kind of insect or arachnid. Then it says, \"with silver chains it catches prey,\" which is interesting. Maybe it's referring to spider silk, which can look silvery in certain lights.\n\nWait, spiders do have multiple eyes, and they catch prey with silk threads. And they eat their prey after catching them. So, spider seems like a possible answer. But then the last two lines say, \"And eats it all before it dies. Yet in every cottage does it stay. And every castle beneath the sky.\" That suggests that this creature is ubiquitous, found everywhere, from humble cottages to grand castles.\n\nSpiders are indeed found almost everywhere, making them a good fit for this description. But let's consider if there are other possibilities. Maybe it's not a literal monster but something else that fits the description.\n\nAnother interpretation could be a mouse. Mice are nocturnal, have many legs and eyes (although eyes might be just two, but in the context of a riddle, it might be exaggerated). They scurry around catching food with their agile movements, which could be likened to silver chains. And they are indeed found in every cottage and castle.\n\nBut going back to the spider idea, it seems to fit well. Let's see if there are any other clues. The phrase \"horrid monster\" might suggest something more fearsome than a spider, but spiders can certainly be considered monsters to some people, especially with their multiple legs and eyes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a centipede or a millipede, given the many legs. But centipedes aren't typically associated with silver chains unless referring to their bodies, which can glisten in certain lights.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a moth. Moths are nocturnal, have many eyes (again, probably exaggerated), and silver chains could refer to their wings or the way they fly. However, moths don't catch prey; they feed on nectar or other substances.\n\nHmm, maybe it's a scorpion. Scorpions have many legs and eyes, are nocturnal, and catch prey with their pincers, which could be likened to silver chains. But scorpions aren't as ubiquitous as spiders, and they don't eat all their prey before dying, as far as I know.\n\nAnother angle: could it be a metaphor for something else? Like, perhaps hunger or some other abstract concept? But that seems less likely given the specific physical characteristics mentioned.\n\nLet me consider the line \"with silver chains it catches prey.\" What could silver chains represent? Maybe it's something that's thin and shiny, like spider silk, which is incredibly strong and used to trap prey.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's found in every cottage and every castle suggests it's a common household creature. Spiders are indeed common in houses, as are mice.\n\nBut spiders seem to fit better with the description of having many legs and many eyes, and catching prey with something that could be described as silver chains.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"eats it all before it dies\" could refer to spiders' habit of consuming their prey entirely, including the exoskeleton in some cases.\n\nSo, all things considered, I think the answer to the riddle is a spider."
