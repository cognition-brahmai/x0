        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a restaurant that sells hamburgers and hot dogs. Hamburgers are $5 each, and hot dogs are $3 each. They sold a total of 100 items and made $400 in revenue. We need to find out how many hamburgers and hot dogs they sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's use variables to represent the unknowns. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( h \\) be the number of hamburgers sold.\n\n- Let \\( d \\) be the number of hot dogs sold.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of items sold is 100.\n\n2. The total revenue is $400.\n\nSo, we can translate these into equations.\n\nFirst equation: Total items sold\n\n\\[ h + d = 100 \\]\n\nSecond equation: Total revenue\n\n\\[ 5h + 3d = 400 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be straightforward here.\n\nLet\u2019s use the first equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other. For example, solve for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[ h = 100 - d \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( h \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 5(100 - d) + 3d = 400 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify and solve for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ 500 - 5d + 3d = 400 \\]\n\n\\[ 500 - 2d = 400 \\]\n\nSubtract 500 from both sides:\n\n\\[ -2d = -100 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n\\[ d = 50 \\]\n\nSo, they sold 50 hot dogs.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[ h = 100 - 50 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, they sold 50 hamburgers and 50 hot dogs.\n\nBut wait, let\u2019s double-check this. If they sold 50 hamburgers at $5 each, that\u2019s \\( 50 \\times 5 = 250 \\) dollars. Plus 50 hot dogs at $3 each, that\u2019s \\( 50 \\times 3 = 150 \\) dollars. Total revenue would be \\( 250 + 150 = 400 \\) dollars, which matches the given total. Also, total items sold are \\( 50 + 50 = 100 \\), which also matches. So, our solution seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the elimination method directly without solving for one variable. Let\u2019s see:\n\nWe have:\n\n1. \\( h + d = 100 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5h + 3d = 400 \\)\n\nLet\u2019s multiply the first equation by 3:\n\n\\[ 3h + 3d = 300 \\]\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n\\[ (5h + 3d) - (3h + 3d) = 400 - 300 \\]\n\n\\[ 2h = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ h = 50 \\]\n\nThen, plug back into the first equation:\n\n\\[ 50 + d = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ d = 50 \\]\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, we arrive at the same conclusion: they sold 50 hamburgers and 50 hot dogs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ hamburgers and } 50 \\text{ hot dogs}} \\]"
