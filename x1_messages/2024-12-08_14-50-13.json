        "content": "To evaluate the limit as x approaches infinity of (3x^2 - 2x) / (x^2 + 1), I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the degrees of the numerator and denominator:**\n   - The numerator is \\( 3x^2 - 2x \\), which is a polynomial of degree 2.\n   - The denominator is \\( x^2 + 1 \\), which is also a polynomial of degree 2.\n\n2. **Compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator:**\n   - Since both the numerator and denominator have the same degree (2), the limit as x approaches infinity will be the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n3. **Identify the leading coefficients:**\n   - The leading coefficient of the numerator is 3.\n   - The leading coefficient of the denominator is 1.\n\n4. **Calculate the limit:**\n   - When the degrees are equal, the limit is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n   - Therefore, the limit is \\( \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\).\n\nTo confirm this, let's go through the algebraic steps in more detail:\n\n5. **Divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator:**\n   - The highest power of x in the denominator is \\( x^2 \\).\n   - So, divide both the numerator and the denominator by \\( x^2 \\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3x^2 - 2x}{x^2 + 1} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{3x^2}{x^2} - \\frac{2x}{x^2}}{\\frac{x^2}{x^2} + \\frac{1}{x^2}} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3 - \\frac{2}{x}}{1 + \\frac{1}{x^2}}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Evaluate the limit of each term:**\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches infinity:\n     - \\( \\frac{2}{x} \\) approaches 0.\n     - \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) approaches 0.\n   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 - 0}{1 + 0} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3\n     \\]\n\nSo, the limit as \\( x \\) approaches infinity of \\( \\frac{3x^2 - 2x}{x^2 + 1} \\) is \\( 3 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
