        "content": "So I have this problem here: a rectangle has a length of 10 meters and a width of 5 meters. I need to find out what the perimeter is. Alright, let's see. I remember that the perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the outside. For a rectangle, that means adding up all four sides.\n\nNow, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length. So, if the length is 10 meters, then the two longer sides are both 10 meters each. Similarly, the width is 5 meters, so the two shorter sides are both 5 meters each.\n\nTo find the perimeter, I can add up all four sides: 10 + 10 + 5 + 5. Let me do that. 10 plus 10 is 20, and 5 plus 5 is 10. So, 20 plus 10 equals 30 meters. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut I also recall that there's a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width. Let me try that formula with the given values. So, P = 2 times 10 plus 2 times 5. That's 20 plus 10, which again gives me 30 meters. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? I've heard someone mention that the perimeter can also be calculated as twice the sum of the length and width. So, that would be P = 2(L + W). Let's try that: 2 times (10 + 5) is 2 times 15, which is 30 meters. Again, the same answer. So, it seems like no matter which method I use, I get 30 meters as the perimeter.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should draw a diagram to visualize this. Let's see:\n\n[Imagine a rectangle with length labeled as 10m and width labeled as 5m.]\n\nSo, starting from one corner and going around the rectangle, the sides would be: 10m, 5m, 10m, and 5m. Adding those up: 10 + 5 + 10 + 5 = 30 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about walking around the rectangle, I'd walk 10 meters, then 5 meters, then another 10 meters, and finally 5 meters to get back to the starting point. The total distance I'd have walked is 30 meters, which is the perimeter.\n\nI also wonder if the units matter here. The problem gives the dimensions in meters, so the perimeter should be in meters as well. If the dimensions were in different units, I'd need to convert them to the same unit before calculating the perimeter. But in this case, everything is already in meters, so that's straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance that the length and width could be different. Wait, the problem clearly states that the length is 10 meters and the width is 5 meters. So, there's no ambiguity there.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if perhaps the rectangle is a special type, like a square. But in a square, all sides are equal, which isn't the case here since the length and width are different. So, it's definitely a rectangle.\n\nI've used three different methods to calculate the perimeter, and all of them give me the same answer: 30 meters. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it in terms of area too, but I realize that area is a different property. The area of a rectangle is length times width, which would be 10 meters times 5 meters, equaling 50 square meters. But that's not related to the perimeter, so I don't need to worry about that for this problem.\n\nJust to be completely sure, I'll consider if there are any tricks or common mistakes people make with perimeter calculations. One common mistake is to confuse perimeter with area, but I don't think that's the case here. Another mistake could be to forget that opposite sides are equal in a rectangle, but I've accounted for that.\n\nAlternatively, someone might mistakenly add only two adjacent sides and forget to include all four sides. But in this case, I've made sure to include all four sides in my calculations.\n\nI've also considered using the formula and verified it with direct addition, so I'm confident that 30 meters is the correct perimeter for this rectangle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
