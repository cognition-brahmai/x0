        "content": "So there are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in a box, making a total of 10 balls. You're going to pick one ball, put it back, and then pick another one. You want to know the probability of picking two red balls in a row.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw. There are 4 red balls out of 10 total balls, so the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nNow, since you're replacing the ball after the first pick, the total number of balls remains the same for the second draw. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second draw is also 2/5.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together (picking a red ball twice in a row), you need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two red balls is (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 4/25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}} \\]"
