        "content": "So the company currently produces 500 units per day, and each unit brings in $25 in revenue. If they increase production by 20%, I need to find out how much extra revenue that would generate.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 20% of the current production is. So, 20% of 500 units is calculated by multiplying 500 by 0.20. That would be 500 * 0.20 = 100 units.\n\nSo, if they increase production by 20%, they'll be producing an additional 100 units per day.\n\nNow, since each unit generates $25 in revenue, the additional revenue from these 100 units would be 100 units * $25 per unit.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 100 * 25 = $2,500.\n\nTherefore, if the company increases production by 20%, they can expect an additional $2,500 in revenue per day.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider here? For example, are there any costs associated with increasing production that might eat into this additional revenue? The question seems to just be asking for the additional revenue generated, not considering costs or profit. So, based on the information provided, the additional revenue is $2,500 per day.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it another way. If they increase production by 20%, their new daily production would be the original 500 units plus the additional 100 units, totaling 600 units per day.\n\nThe total revenue at the new production level would be 600 units * $25 per unit = $15,000 per day.\n\nOriginally, with 500 units, the revenue was 500 * $25 = $12,500 per day.\n\nSo, the additional revenue is $15,000 - $12,500 = $2,500 per day.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2500} \\]"
