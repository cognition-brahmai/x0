        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train going from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. It stops for 30 minutes halfway through the journey due to technical issues and still manages to reach City B exactly 3 hours after leaving City A. We need to find the distance between City A and City B.\n\nFirst, let's understand the journey in parts. The train travels halfway to City B at 60 mph, then stops for 30 minutes, and then continues the second half of the journey at the same speed of 60 mph, arriving exactly 3 hours after departure.\n\nLet's denote the total distance between City A and City B as D miles. Therefore, halfway distance would be D/2 miles.\n\nNow, time taken to travel the first half of the journey before the stop:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time for the first half = (D/2) / 60 hours.\n\nSimilarly, time for the second half after the stop would also be (D/2) / 60 hours.\n\nAdditionally, there's a 30-minute stop. We need to make sure all units are consistent, so let's convert 30 minutes to hours, which is 0.5 hours.\n\nTotal time for the journey is the sum of time for the first half, the stop, and the second half, which equals 3 hours.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(D/2)/60 + 0.5 + (D/2)/60 = 3\n\nLet's simplify this equation to solve for D.\n\nFirst, (D/2)/60 can be written as D/(2*60) = D/120.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nD/120 + 0.5 + D/120 = 3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2*(D/120) + 0.5 = 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nD/60 + 0.5 = 3\n\nNow, subtract 0.5 from both sides:\n\nD/60 = 2.5\n\nFinally, multiply both sides by 60 to solve for D:\n\nD = 2.5 * 60\n\nD = 150 miles\n\nSo, the distance between City A and City B is 150 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIf D is 150 miles, then halfway is 75 miles.\n\nTime for first half: 75 miles / 60 mph = 1.25 hours or 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\nStop time: 30 minutes.\n\nTime for second half: another 75 miles / 60 mph = 1.25 hours or 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 1 hour 15 minutes + 30 minutes + 1 hour 15 minutes = 2 hours 60 minutes, which is 3 hours. That checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet's consider the average speed for the entire journey and see if that gives us the same answer.\n\nThe train travels at 60 mph for the first half, stops for 30 minutes, and then travels at 60 mph for the second half, totaling 3 hours.\n\nSo, the actual driving time is 3 hours minus the 0.5 hours stop, which is 2.5 hours.\n\nDuring these 2.5 hours, the train is moving at 60 mph, so total distance covered while moving is 60 mph * 2.5 hours = 150 miles.\n\nSince the stop doesn't add to the distance, the total distance between City A and City B is indeed 150 miles.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the average speed for the entire journey, including the stop.\n\nTotal time is 3 hours, total distance is D miles.\n\nBut the train was stopped for 0.5 hours, so it was moving for 2.5 hours at 60 mph, covering 150 miles.\n\nSo again, D = 150 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to calculate the average speed including the stop:\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time\n\nAverage speed = D / 3 hours\n\nBut the train was moving at 60 mph for 2.5 hours, covering 150 miles, and stopped for 0.5 hours.\n\nSo, average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.\n\nBut I don't think we need the average speed to find the distance, as we've already determined D is 150 miles.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any reason to think that the train's speed changed after the stop or that the stop wasn't exactly halfway through the journey?\n\nThe problem states that the train travels at a constant speed of 60 mph and stops halfway through the journey for 30 minutes.\n\nSo, the speed remains constant at 60 mph for both halves of the journey, and the stop is exactly halfway.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of time-distance relationship.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total time as T = 3 hours.\n\nLet t be the time taken to travel the first half.\n\nThen, the time taken to travel the second half is also t.\n\nTotal driving time is 2t.\n\nBut there is a stop of 0.5 hours.\n\nSo, total time is 2t + 0.5 = 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, 2t = 2.5 hours, so t = 1.25 hours.\n\nDistance of the first half is speed * time = 60 mph * 1.25 hours = 75 miles.\n\nTherefore, total distance D = 2 * 75 = 150 miles.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nPerhaps I can also think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf the train hadn't stopped, the total time to travel D miles at 60 mph would be D/60 hours.\n\nBut due to the stop, the total time is D/60 + 0.5 hours, which is equal to 3 hours.\n\nSo, D/60 + 0.5 = 3\n\nThen, D/60 = 2.5\n\nD = 2.5 * 60 = 150 miles.\n\nThis is yet another way to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for total time:\n\nTotal time = time for first half + stop time + time for second half.\n\nWhich is (D/2)/60 + 0.5 + (D/2)/60 = 3\n\nAs I did earlier, leading to D = 150 miles.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles and consistently arrived at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the distance between City A and City B is 150 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
