The usual suspects are up to their old tricks, and it's getting out of hand. I need someone to cover my six while I deal with this latest threat. It's not just any criminal; it's someone who's been causing a lot of havoc lately. I can't take them on alone this time.\n\nSo, if you're available, could you swing by? Maybe meet me at the usual spot? I'll have my signal ready. Just let me know if you can make it. Time is of the essence here. We can't let this get out of control.\n\nThanks in advance. Let's hope we can put an end to this before things get worse.\n\n-B [:P]"
