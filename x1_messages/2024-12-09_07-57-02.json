        "content": "Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, standing at approximately 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. To determine how much money would be in a stack of $100 bills reaching this height, we need to know the thickness of a single $100 bill.\n\nA standard U.S. banknote, including the $100 bill, has a thickness of about 0.0043 inches or roughly 0.109 millimeters.\n\nFirst, let's convert the height of Mount Everest into millimeters for easier calculation:\n\n8,848 meters = 8,848,000 millimeters\n\nNow, to find out how many $100 bills are needed to reach this height, we divide the total height by the thickness of one bill:\n\nNumber of bills = Total height / Thickness per bill\n\nNumber of bills = 8,848,000 mm / 0.109 mm per bill\n\nNumber of bills \u2248 8,848,000 / 0.109 \u2248 81,174,311.93 bills\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bill, we'll round this to the nearest whole number:\n\n\u2248 81,174,312 bills\n\nEach bill is worth $100, so the total amount of money in the stack would be:\n\nTotal amount = Number of bills \u00d7 Value per bill\n\nTotal amount = 81,174,312 bills \u00d7 $100/bill\n\nTotal amount = $8,117,431,200\n\nTherefore, the stack of $100 bills reaching the height of Mount Everest would contain approximately $8,117,431,200.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- For comparison, the U.S. federal budget for 2021 was over $6 trillion, so this stack of money is a small fraction of that.\n\n- The weight of a single $100 bill is about 1 gram. Therefore, the total weight of the stack would be approximately 81,174,312 grams, which is about 81,174.312 kilograms or around 81.174 metric tons.\n\n- Stacking bills this high is purely theoretical, as such a stack would require impossible structural support and would not be feasible in reality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8,117,431,200} \\]"
