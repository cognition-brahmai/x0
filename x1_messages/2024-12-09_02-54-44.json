        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about cars in a parking lot. It says there are 4 times as many red cars as blue cars, and twice as many green cars as red cars. And there are 15 blue cars. I need to find the total number of cars.\n\nOkay, first, I should figure out how many red cars there are. Since there are 4 times as many red cars as blue cars, and there are 15 blue cars, I can calculate the number of red cars by multiplying 15 by 4.\n\nSo, red cars = 4 * blue cars = 4 * 15 = 60.\n\nNext, it says there are twice as many green cars as red cars. So, green cars = 2 * red cars = 2 * 60 = 120.\n\nNow, to find the total number of cars, I need to add up the blue, red, and green cars.\n\nTotal cars = blue cars + red cars + green cars = 15 + 60 + 120.\n\nLet me add those up: 15 plus 60 is 75, and 75 plus 120 is 195.\n\nSo, there are 195 cars in total in the parking lot.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 15 blue cars, and red cars are 4 times that, which is 60, and green cars are twice the red cars, which is 120, then adding them up should be 15 + 60 + 120 = 195. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{195} \\]"
