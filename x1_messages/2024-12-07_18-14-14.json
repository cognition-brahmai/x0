        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The original dimensions are a length of 15 meters and a width of 8 meters. I need to find the area of the garden with these dimensions, and then find the new area if both the length and the width are increased by 3 meters each.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the area of a rectangle. I think it's length multiplied by width, right? So, area equals length times width.\n\nSo, for the original garden:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 15 meters \u00d7 8 meters = 120 square meters.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, if both dimensions are increased by 3 meters each, that means the new length will be 15 + 3 = 18 meters, and the new width will be 8 + 3 = 11 meters.\n\nThen, the new area would be:\n\nNew area = new length \u00d7 new width = 18 meters \u00d7 11 meters.\n\nHmm, what's 18 times 11? I can calculate that.\n\n18 \u00d7 10 = 180, and 18 \u00d7 1 = 18, so 180 + 18 = 198 square meters.\n\nSo, the original area is 120 square meters, and the new area after increasing both dimensions by 3 meters each is 198 square meters.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, original area: 15 \u00d7 8. Yes, that's 120 square meters.\n\nThen, new dimensions: 15 + 3 = 18 meters, and 8 + 3 = 11 meters.\n\nNew area: 18 \u00d7 11.\n\nLet me verify 18 \u00d7 11.\n\nI know that 10 \u00d7 18 = 180, and 1 \u00d7 18 = 18, so together that's 198 square meters.\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the area of a rectangle with increased dimensions.\n\nLet me see, if the original length is L and the original width is W, and both are increased by X meters, then the new area would be (L + X)(W + X).\n\nSo, in this case, L = 15, W = 8, X = 3.\n\nSo, new area = (15 + 3)(8 + 3) = 18 \u00d7 11 = 198 square meters.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how much the area has increased.\n\nThe increase in area would be the new area minus the original area: 198 - 120 = 78 square meters.\n\nIs there another way to calculate the increase in area?\n\nYes, I can think about it in terms of adding parts.\n\nThe increase consists of two rectangular strips (one along the length and one along the width) plus a small square where the increases overlap.\n\nSo, the increase would be:\n\nOriginal length \u00d7 increase in width + original width \u00d7 increase in length + increase in length \u00d7 increase in width.\n\nWait, since both length and width are increased by the same amount, X = 3 meters.\n\nSo, increase in area = L\u00d7X + W\u00d7X + X\u00d7X = X\u00d7(L + W + X).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nIncrease in area = 3 \u00d7 (15 + 8 + 3) = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 square meters.\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nSo, the new area is original area plus increase in area: 120 + 78 = 198 square meters.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the area of a rectangle with increased dimensions:\n\nNew area = (L + X)(W + X) = L\u00d7W + L\u00d7X + W\u00d7X + X\u00b2.\n\nWhich is the same as the original area plus the increase in area.\n\nAgain, this matches the previous calculation.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to approach this problem.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Original area: 15 m \u00d7 8 m = 120 m\u00b2.\n\n- New dimensions: 18 m \u00d7 11 m.\n\n- New area: 18 m \u00d7 11 m = 198 m\u00b2.\n\nAnd the increase in area is 78 m\u00b2, which can be calculated through different methods, all leading to the same result.\n\nI'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the original garden is \\boxed{120} square meters, and the new area after increasing both dimensions by 3 meters each is \\boxed{198} square meters."
