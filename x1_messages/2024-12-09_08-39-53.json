        "content": "The classic board game you're referring to is Monopoly. In Monopoly, players roll dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. The goal is to drive opponents into bankruptcy by charging rent on properties they land on. The game was originally designed by Elizabeth Magie in 1903 as \"The Landlord's Game\" to demonstrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. However, the version we know today was developed by Charles Darrow and popularized by Parker Brothers in 1935. Over the years, Monopoly has become one of the best-selling board games worldwide, with numerous editions and adaptations featuring different themes and locales."
