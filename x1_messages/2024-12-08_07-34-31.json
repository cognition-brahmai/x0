        "content": "An Olympic-sized swimming pool typically holds about 660,000 gallons of water. The standard dimensions for such a pool are 50 meters in length, 25 meters in width, and a depth of at least 2 meters. To calculate the volume, you can use the formula: volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 depth. So, 50m \u00d7 25m \u00d7 2m = 2,500 cubic meters. Since 1 cubic meter is approximately 264.172 gallons, multiplying 2,500 by 264.172 gives you around 660,430 gallons. However, it's commonly rounded to 660,000 gallons for simplicity."
