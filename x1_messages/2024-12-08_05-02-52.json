        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the factory produces 1200 widgets every 8 hours, and it operates 24 hours a day. We need to find out how many widgets it produces in a 30-day month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the production rate. If the factory produces 1200 widgets in 8 hours, what's its hourly production rate? To find that, I can divide the number of widgets by the number of hours:\n\n1200 widgets / 8 hours = 150 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, since the factory operates 24 hours a day, I can calculate the daily production by multiplying the hourly rate by 24:\n\n150 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 3600 widgets per day.\n\nFinally, to find out the monthly production for a 30-day month, I'll multiply the daily production by 30:\n\n3600 widgets/day * 30 days = 108,000 widgets.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many 8-hour shifts there are in a 24-hour day. Since 24 divided by 8 is 3, there are 3 shifts per day. So, if each shift produces 1200 widgets, then daily production would be:\n\n1200 widgets(shift) * 3 shifts/day = 3600 widgets per day.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. Now, multiplying by 30 days gives me the same result: 3600 widgets/day * 30 days = 108,000 widgets.\n\nHmm, but just to be thorough, let's consider the month has 30 days and each day has 24 hours, so the total operating hours in the month are:\n\n24 hours/day * 30 days = 720 hours.\n\nNow, since the factory produces 150 widgets per hour, the total production would be:\n\n150 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 108,000 widgets.\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nI think 108,000 widgets is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108000} \\]"
