        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 12 black socks and 12 white socks all mixed up in a drawer, and it's pitch dark, meaning I can't see a thing. I need to figure out the minimum number of socks I must take out to make sure I have at least one matching pair.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a matching pair means. A matching pair would be two socks of the same color, either both black or both white.\n\nNow, since it's completely dark, I can't see the colors, so I have to consider the worst possible scenario to ensure that I get a matching pair.\n\nLet's think about the worst-case scenario. Suppose I pick one sock, and it's black. Then I pick another sock, and it's white. Now, I have one black and one white sock, but they don't match. So, I need to pick a third sock.\n\nIf I pick a third sock, it can either be black or white. If it's black, then I have two black socks, which is a matching pair. If it's white, then I have two white socks, which is also a matching pair.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, I pick one black and one white sock first, and the third sock I pick will definitely make a matching pair with one of the first two.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks I need to take out to guarantee at least one matching pair is three.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe there's a chance that I could get a matching pair by picking just two socks. For example, if I pick two socks and both happen to be black, or both happen to be white, then I have a matching pair. But that's not guaranteed because I could also pick one black and one white sock.\n\nSo, to guarantee that I have at least one matching pair, I need to consider the worst-case scenario, which is picking one of each color first, and then the next sock I pick will definitely make a matching pair.\n\nYes, I think three is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. Are there any constraints or additional information in the problem that I haven't considered? The problem says there are 12 black socks and 12 white socks, but I don't think the exact numbers matter beyond knowing there are multiple socks of each color.\n\nEven if there were fewer socks of one color, as long as there are at least two socks of each color, the worst-case scenario would still require picking three socks to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nFor example, if there were only one black sock and twelve white socks, then picking three socks could still guarantee a matching pair because the worst case would be picking one black and two white socks, which gives me a matching pair of white socks.\n\nBut in this problem, there are twelve of each, so my earlier reasoning still holds.\n\nI think three is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider picking four socks. In that case, I would definitely have a matching pair, but it's not the minimum number because three socks are sufficient to guarantee a matching pair.\n\nSo, the minimum number is three.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
