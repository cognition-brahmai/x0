        "content": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the production cost for a new smartphone model. Let's break it down step by step. First, I need to find out the total production cost and then the cost per unit. The company is making 100,000 units in the first batch.\n\nOkay, so the components for each smartphone are:\n\n- Screen: $50\n\n- Battery: $20\n\n- Processor: $30\n\n- Miscellaneous parts: $40\n\n- Assembly cost per unit: $10\n\nFirst, I should find out the total cost for all the components for one smartphone. So, I'll add up the screen, battery, processor, and miscellaneous parts.\n\nScreen: $50\n\nBattery: $20\n\nProcessor: $30\n\nMiscellaneous parts: $40\n\nTotal components cost per unit = $50 + $20 + $30 + $40 = $140\n\nThen, there's an assembly cost of $10 per unit. So, the total cost per unit would be the sum of the components and the assembly cost.\n\nTotal cost per unit = $140 + $10 = $150\n\nNow, since the company is producing 100,000 units, I need to calculate the total production cost for all these units.\n\nTotal production cost = total cost per unit \u00d7 number of units\n\nTotal production cost = $150 \u00d7 100,000 = $15,000,000\n\nSo, the total production cost is $15,000,000, and the cost per unit is $150.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the components per unit:\n\nScreen: $50\n\nBattery: $20\n\nProcessor: $30\n\nMiscellaneous parts: $40\n\nAdding those up: 50 + 20 = 70, plus 30 is 100, plus 40 is 140. Okay, that checks out.\n\nThen, assembly cost per unit: $10\n\nSo, total cost per unit: $140 + $10 = $150. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 100,000 units, total production cost: $150 \u00d7 100,000\n\nWell, 150 \u00d7 100,000 is indeed 15,000,000.\n\nSo, the answers are:\n\nTotal production cost: $15,000,000\n\nCost per unit: $150\n\nI think that's straightforward. Is there anything else I need to consider? Maybe overhead costs or other expenses, but based on the information provided, this seems to cover the direct production costs.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with these calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Total production cost: } \\$15,000,000 \\text{ and cost per unit: } \\$150} \\]"
