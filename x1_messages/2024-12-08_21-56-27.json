        "content": "So, there's this problem about splitting a pizza among friends. The pizza has 16 slices, and we need to find out the maximum number of people that can share it equally. Each person should get the same number of slices. Hmm, this sounds like a division problem.\n\nSo, if we have 16 slices and we want to divide them equally among people, the number of people has to be a divisor of 16. That means 16 divided by the number of people should give us a whole number, right? Because you can't give someone a fraction of a slice if we're talking about whole slices.\n\nLet me list out the divisors of 16. The divisors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. So, the possible number of people that can share the pizza equally are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.\n\nBut the question is asking for the maximum number of people that can be in the group. So, looking at the list, the largest number is 16.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? If there are 16 people, each person would get 1 slice. That seems like the maximum number of people who can share the pizza equally.\n\nLet me double-check. If we had more than 16 people, say 17, then 16 divided by 17 is less than 1 slice per person, which isn't possible if we're dealing with whole slices. So, 16 is indeed the maximum number.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that perhaps some slices could be further divided into smaller pieces, but the problem specifies that each person gets an equal number of slices, and it mentions \"slices,\" implying whole slices.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of people that can be in the group is 16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
