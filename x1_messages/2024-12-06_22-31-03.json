        "content": "So the factory makes 2500 widgets every day, and each widget weighs 1.2 pounds. I need to find out how many pounds of widgets are produced in a whole week. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are made in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, and the factory makes 2500 widgets each day, I can multiply 2500 by 7 to get the total number of widgets per week.\n\nSo, 2500 widgets/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 17,500 widgets/week.\n\nNow, each widget weighs 1.2 pounds, so to find the total weight, I need to multiply the number of widgets by the weight per widget.\n\nThat would be 17,500 widgets \u00d7 1.2 pounds/widget.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 17,500 times 1.2.\n\nWell, 17,500 times 1 is 17,500, and 17,500 times 0.2 is 3,500. So, 17,500 plus 3,500 equals 21,000.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 21,000 pounds of widgets in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I could first calculate the daily production in pounds and then multiply by 7 for the weekly total.\n\nSo, daily production is 2500 widgets \u00d7 1.2 pounds/widget = 3,000 pounds/day.\n\nThen, 3,000 pounds/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 21,000 pounds/week.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it looks like 21,000 pounds is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there holidays or days when the factory doesn't operate? The question doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume the factory operates every day of the week.\n\nAlso, it says \"each widget weighs 1.2 pounds,\" so I don't need to worry about varying weights or anything like that.\n\nSo, yes, 21,000 pounds per week seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21000} \\]"
