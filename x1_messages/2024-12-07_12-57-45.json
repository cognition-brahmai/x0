        "content": "That's a great question! I believe the answer is Venezuela. Angel Falls, also known as Salto \u00c1ngel in Spanish, is located in the Canaima National Park in the Gran Sabana region of Bol\u00edvar State, Venezuela. It's named after Jimmie Angel, a US aviator who was the first to fly over the falls in 1933. The waterfall drops off the edge of the Auy\u00e1n-tepui mountain and is considered one of the most spectacular natural wonders in the world. Venezuela is indeed a country with a rich biodiversity and many natural attractions, but Angel Falls is undoubtedly its most famous landmark. I hope that answers your question!\n"
