        "content": "So I have this problem here: If a car has 4 tires and a bicycle has 2 tires, how many tires are there in total if I have 3 cars and 3 bicycles? And I need to use step-by-step logic to figure it out. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a certain number of cars and bicycles, and each has a specific number of tires. I need to find the total number of tires from all of them combined.\n\nSo, let's start by looking at the cars. Each car has 4 tires, and I have 3 cars. To find out how many tires the cars have in total, I should multiply the number of cars by the number of tires per car. That makes sense.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of tires from cars = Number of cars \u00d7 Tires per car\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of tires from cars = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 tires\n\nOkay, so the cars contribute 12 tires to the total.\n\nNext, I have the bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and I have 3 bicycles. Similarly, to find the total number of tires from the bicycles, I'll multiply the number of bicycles by the number of tires per bicycle.\n\nSo:\n\nNumber of tires from bicycles = Number of bicycles \u00d7 Tires per bicycle\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of tires from bicycles = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 tires\n\nAlright, so the bicycles add 6 tires to the total.\n\nNow, to find the overall total number of tires, I need to add the tires from the cars and the tires from the bicycles together.\n\nTotal tires = Tires from cars + Tires from bicycles\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal tires = 12 + 6 = 18 tires\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLet me think again:\n\n- Each car has 4 tires, and there are 3 cars: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 tires.\n\n- Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there are 3 bicycles: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 tires.\n\n- Adding them together: 12 + 6 = 18 tires.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the total number of tires. For example, are there any spare tires in the cars? The problem doesn't mention any spare tires, so I probably shouldn't assume there are any.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that the numbers given are accurate. The problem states that each car has 4 tires and each bicycle has 2 tires, and I have 3 of each. So, based on that, my calculations seem correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the total number of vehicles and the average number of tires per vehicle, but that might be more complicated than necessary for this problem. Since the numbers are simple, the straightforward multiplication and addition method works fine.\n\nLet me try that alternative approach just to verify.\n\nTotal vehicles = Number of cars + Number of bicycles = 3 + 3 = 6 vehicles\n\nNow, average number of tires per vehicle would be (Total tires) / (Total vehicles). But I already have the total tires from my earlier calculation as 18, so average tires per vehicle would be 18 / 6 = 3 tires per vehicle.\n\nBut since the vehicles have different numbers of tires, the average is 3, which makes sense because cars have 4 and bicycles have 2, and (4 + 2)/2 = 3. So that checks out.\n\nBut to find the total tires using this average, I could multiply the average tires per vehicle by the total number of vehicles: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 tires. Which matches my earlier total.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign that I'm correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of groups. I have 3 groups of cars, each contributing 4 tires, and 3 groups of bicycles, each contributing 2 tires. So, total tires are (3 \u00d7 4) + (3 \u00d7 2) = 12 + 6 = 18 tires.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of miscounting. For example, maybe some vehicles are missing tires or have extra tires. But the problem doesn't indicate that, so I should assume all vehicles have the standard number of tires.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, I can perform the calculations again to ensure there are no arithmetic errors.\n\nFirst calculation:\n\nCars: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 tires\n\nBicycles: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 tires\n\nTotal: 12 + 6 = 18 tires\n\nSecond calculation:\n\nAverage tires per vehicle: (4 + 2)/2 = 3 tires\n\nTotal tires: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 tires\n\nBoth methods confirm the total is 18 tires.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The problem is straightforward, but it's always good to double-check and make sure that no assumptions are being made without justification.\n\nSo, the total number of tires is 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
