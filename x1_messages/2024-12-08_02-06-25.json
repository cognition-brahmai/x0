        "content": "Machu Picchu, often referred to as \"The Lost City of the Incas,\" was built by the Inca civilization. This ancient culture flourished in South America, primarily in the Andean region, from the early 13th century until the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The Inca Empire, at its height, was one of the largest and most advanced civilizations in pre-Columbian America.\n\nMachu Picchu, located in present-day Peru, is a prime example of Inca architecture and engineering. It sits majestically on a mountain ridge above the Urubamba Valley and is renowned for its intricate stonework, sophisticated water supply system, and the way it harmonizes with its natural surroundings. The city was likely built around 1450 but was abandoned just over a century later, possibly due to the Spanish conquest.\n\nThe purpose of Machu Picchu remains a subject of debate among historians and archaeologists. Some theories suggest it was a royal estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, while others propose it served as a religious retreat or a strategic military post. Its remote location and the fact that it was never discovered by the Spanish conquistadors have contributed to its enigmatic allure.\n\nToday, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, attracting thousands of tourists each year who come to marvel at the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the Inca people."
