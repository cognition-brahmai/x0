        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. There are 100 people in a group, and 60% of them are women, while 40% are men. Then, 75% of the women and 50% of the men have brown eyes. I need to find out how many people in total have brown eyes.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many women and men there are in the group. Since there are 100 people and 60% are women, that means there are 60 women. Similarly, 40% are men, so there are 40 men.\n\nNow, out of these 60 women, 75% have brown eyes. To find out how many that is, I can calculate 75% of 60. Let's see, 75% is the same as 0.75, so 0.75 times 60 is 45. So, 45 women have brown eyes.\n\nNext, for the men, 50% have brown eyes. So, 50% of 40 men. 50% is 0.5, and 0.5 times 40 is 20. Therefore, 20 men have brown eyes.\n\nNow, to find the total number of people with brown eyes, I just need to add the number of women with brown eyes and the number of men with brown eyes. That's 45 plus 20, which equals 65.\n\nSo, there are 65 people in the group who have brown eyes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way could be to find the overall percentage of people with brown eyes and then apply that percentage to the total number of people.\n\nFirst, find the total number of people with brown eyes, which I already did as 65, and see if that matches with the overall percentage.\n\nBut actually, that might not be the best way to cross-verify. Maybe I can calculate the percentages again.\n\nLet me recalculate the number of women with brown eyes: 75% of 60 is 45, that seems correct.\n\nNumber of men with brown eyes: 50% of 40 is 20, that also seems correct.\n\nAdding them up gives 65, which seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of probabilities.\n\nThe probability that a person is a woman is 60%, and among women, 75% have brown eyes. So, the probability that a person is a woman with brown eyes is 60% times 75%, which is 0.6 times 0.75, which is 0.45, or 45%.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that a person is a man is 40%, and among men, 50% have brown eyes. So, the probability that a person is a man with brown eyes is 40% times 50%, which is 0.4 times 0.5, which is 0.2, or 20%.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that a person has brown eyes, I can add these two probabilities: 45% plus 20% equals 65%.\n\nThen, 65% of 100 people is 65 people, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm that 65 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way to look at this problem.\n\nSuppose I want to find out the number of people without brown eyes and subtract that from the total.\n\nFirst, find the number of women without brown eyes: 25% of women, since 75% have brown eyes. So, 25% of 60 women is 0.25 times 60, which is 15 women without brown eyes.\n\nSimilarly, the number of men without brown eyes: 50% of men have brown eyes, so 50% do not. 50% of 40 men is 20 men without brown eyes.\n\nTotal people without brown eyes: 15 women plus 20 men, which is 35 people.\n\nTotal people are 100, so people with brown eyes are 100 minus 35, which is 65.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles and keep getting 65 as the answer. So, I'm confident that's the correct number of people with brown eyes in the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]"
