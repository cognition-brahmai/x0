        "content": "So I've got this problem here about estimating the total cost of a new luxury resort and figuring out what occupancy rate is needed to break even within five years. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to estimate the total cost of the project. There are two main components: the cost to construct the rooms and the infrastructure investments.\n\n1. **Room construction costs:**\n   - There are 150 rooms.\n   - Each room costs $300,000 to construct.\n   - So, total room construction cost = 150 rooms * $300,000/room = $45,000,000.\n\n2. **Infrastructure investments:**\n   - This is a flat cost of $10,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the project is the sum of these two amounts:\nTotal cost = Room construction costs + Infrastructure investments = $45,000,000 + $10,000,000 = $55,000,000.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the occupancy rate needed to break even within five years. To do this, I need to determine the revenue required to cover both the initial investment and the operating expenses over five years.\n\n3. **Initial investment:**\n   - Total cost = $55,000,000.\n\n4. **Operating expenses:**\n   - Annual operating expenses = $5,000,000.\n   - Over five years, total operating expenses = 5 * $5,000,000 = $25,000,000.\n\n5. **Total costs over five years:**\n   - Total costs = Initial investment + Total operating expenses = $55,000,000 + $25,000,000 = $80,000,000.\n\nNow, I need to find out the revenue required to cover these total costs over five years.\n\n6. **Revenue calculation:**\n   - The resort has 150 rooms.\n   - Average daily room rate = $400.\n   - Number of days in five years = 5 * 365 = 1,825 days (assuming no leap years).\n\nLet's denote the occupancy rate as 'r' (a decimal between 0 and 1).\n\nThen, the total revenue over five years can be calculated as:\nRevenue = Number of rooms * Occupancy rate * Average daily rate * Number of days\n        = 150 * r * $400 * 1,825.\n\nTo break even, revenue must equal total costs:\n150 * r * 400 * 1,825 = $80,000,000.\n\nNow, I can solve for 'r':\n\nr = $80,000,000 / (150 * 400 * 1,825)\n\nLet me calculate the denominator:\n\n150 * 400 = 60,000\n\n60,000 * 1,825 = 109,500,000\n\nSo,\n\nr = 80,000,000 / 109,500,000 \u2248 0.7297\n\nTo express this as a percentage, I multiply by 100:\n\nOccupancy rate \u2248 72.97%\n\nTherefore, the resort needs to maintain an occupancy rate of approximately 73% over five years to break even on the total investment of $80,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total cost of the project is \\boxed{55,000,000} dollars, and the occupancy rate needed to break even within five years is approximately \\boxed{73\\%}."
