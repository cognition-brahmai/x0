        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the rental shop charges $15 per bicycle for the first 3 hours and then an additional $5 per hour after that. The group is renting 8 bicycles for 6 hours. I need to find out the total cost.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the cost per bicycle for 6 hours. Since the first 3 hours cost $15, and then there are 3 more hours (because 6 - 3 = 3), and each additional hour costs $5, I need to calculate the cost for those extra hours.\n\nSo, for each bicycle, the cost for the first 3 hours is $15. For the next 3 hours, it's $5 per hour, so 3 hours times $5 per hour is $15. Therefore, the total cost per bicycle for 6 hours is $15 (first 3 hours) plus $15 (next 3 hours), which equals $30 per bicycle.\n\nNow, since the group is renting 8 bicycles, I need to multiply the cost per bicycle by the number of bicycles. So, 8 bicycles times $30 per bicycle equals $240.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. The total number of hours is 6, but the rate changes after the first 3 hours. So, for each bicycle, it's $15 for the first 3 hours and then $5 per hour for each hour beyond 3 hours.\n\nSo, for 6 hours, that's 3 hours at $15 and 3 hours at $5 per hour. Yes, that matches what I did earlier: $15 plus $15 equals $30 per bicycle.\n\nNow, multiplying by 8 bicycles: 8 times $30 is indeed $240.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the cost for the first 3 hours for all 8 bicycles plus the cost for the additional 3 hours for all 8 bicycles.\n\nFirst 3 hours: 8 bicycles times $15 per bicycle equals $120.\n\nAdditional 3 hours: 8 bicycles times 3 hours times $5 per hour.\n\nWait, that's 8 times 3 times $5. That's 24 times $5, which is $120.\n\nSo, total cost is $120 (first 3 hours) plus $120 (additional 3 hours) equals $240.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if the additional $5 per hour is for each hour beyond the first 3 hours, and it's per bicycle.\n\nSo, for each bicycle, for 6 hours:\n\n- $15 for the first 3 hours\n\n- Then, for hours 4, 5, and 6, it's $5 per hour per bicycle.\n\nSo, that's $5 for hour 4, $5 for hour 5, and $5 for hour 6, totaling $15 for the additional hours per bicycle.\n\nAdding that to the initial $15, it's $30 per bicycle.\n\nAgain, 8 bicycles times $30 is $240.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they charge the additional $5 per hour for every hour beyond 3 hours, but perhaps it's only $5 per bicycle for each additional hour, not per hour per bicycle. Wait, no, the problem says \"$15 per bicycle for the first 3 hours and an additional $5 per hour after that.\"\n\nSo, the additional $5 per hour is per bicycle.\n\nSo, it's $5 per hour per bicycle for each hour beyond the first 3 hours.\n\nSo, yes, for each bicycle, it's $15 for the first 3 hours plus $5 per hour for each additional hour.\n\nIn this case, 6 hours means 3 additional hours, so $5 times 3 hours equals $15 per bicycle, plus the initial $15, totaling $30 per bicycle.\n\nThen, 8 bicycles times $30 is $240.\n\nI think that's the correct total cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
