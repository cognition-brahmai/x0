        "content": "So, let's see here. The store sells three different products: A, B, and C, with prices $5, $10, and $20 respectively. They sold 50 units of A, 30 units of B, and 20 units of C. I need to find out the total revenue from these sales.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the revenue for each product separately and then add them up to get the total. That seems straightforward.\n\nStarting with Product A: it costs $5 per unit, and they sold 50 units. So, the revenue from Product A would be 50 units times $5 per unit. Let me do that calculation:\n\n50 \u00d7 5 = 250\n\nSo, $250 from Product A.\n\nNext, Product B: $10 per unit, and they sold 30 units. So, revenue from Product B is 30 units times $10 per unit:\n\n30 \u00d7 10 = 300\n\nSo, $300 from Product B.\n\nThen, Product C: $20 per unit, and they sold 20 units. So, revenue from Product C is 20 units times $20 per unit:\n\n20 \u00d7 20 = 400\n\nSo, $400 from Product C.\n\nNow, to find the total revenue, I need to add up the revenues from all three products:\n\n250 + 300 + 400\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n250 + 300 = 550\n\nThen, 550 + 400 = 950\n\nSo, the total revenue generated from these sales is $950.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nStarting with Product A: 50 units at $5 each. 50 \u00d7 5 = 250. That seems correct.\n\nProduct B: 30 units at $10 each. 30 \u00d7 10 = 300. That's right.\n\nProduct C: 20 units at $20 each. 20 \u00d7 20 = 400. Correct.\n\nNow, adding them up: 250 + 300 = 550, and 550 + 400 = 950. Yes, that seems accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total revenue formula, which is the sum of (quantity sold \u00d7 price per unit) for each product. That's exactly what I did.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer? Maybe I can calculate the total revenue using a different method.\n\nAnother approach could be to find the total number of units sold and multiply by some average price, but that seems more complicated and prone to error, especially since the products have different prices.\n\nAlternatively, I could verify the calculation using decimal multiplication, but since the numbers are whole numbers, that shouldn't be necessary.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of miscounting the units or prices. The problem states the quantities sold and the prices clearly, so I don't think there's any mistake there.\n\nWait, perhaps I can calculate the total revenue by considering the contribution of each product to the total.\n\nFor example, Product A contributes 50 units \u00d7 $5 = $250, as I calculated earlier.\n\nProduct B contributes 30 units \u00d7 $10 = $300.\n\nProduct C contributes 20 units \u00d7 $20 = $400.\n\nAdding these contributions gives the total revenue, which is $950.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of percentages or something, but that's unnecessary for this problem.\n\nLet me consider if there are any discounts or additional fees that might affect the total revenue, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I can assume that the total revenue is just the sum of the product revenues.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total revenue per product category and then sum them up, which is essentially what I did.\n\nSo, I think $950 is the correct total revenue.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, I can perform the calculations again.\n\nProduct A: 50 \u00d7 5 = 250\n\nProduct B: 30 \u00d7 10 = 300\n\nProduct C: 20 \u00d7 20 = 400\n\nTotal: 250 + 300 + 400 = 950\n\nYes, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the total revenue in terms of matrices or something, but that's overkill for this problem.\n\nI could also verify by considering the total revenue if they sold only one type of product, but that doesn't seem necessary since the individual calculations check out.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other angle to this problem that I might have missed.\n\nFor example, maybe there are different tax rates for different products, but again, the problem doesn't mention anything like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are bulk discounts, but again, no information is provided about that.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the total revenue is simply the sum of the revenues from each product.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue is $950.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{950} \\]"
