So, for the first 5 days, the total pages read would be 20 pages/day times 5 days, which is 100 pages.\n\nThen, they increase their reading pace to 30 pages per day for the next 7 days. So, for these 7 days, the total pages read would be 30 pages/day times 7 days, which is 210 pages.\n\nNow, to find the total pages read over the entire 12 days, we just need to add the pages from the first 5 days and the next 7 days together. That's 100 pages plus 210 pages, which equals 310 pages.\n\nSo, after 12 days, the person will have read a total of 310 pages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{310} \\]"
