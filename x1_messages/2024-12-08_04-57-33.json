        "content": "Let's see. The factory normally produces 1200 units per day. On Monday, it produced 50% more than its daily production, and on Tuesday, it produced 25% less than its daily production. I need to find the total production for these two days.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate Monday's production. If the factory produces 50% more than usual, that means it produced 1200 plus 50% of 1200.\n\nSo, 50% of 1200 is 0.5 times 1200, which is 600. Therefore, Monday's production is 1200 plus 600, which equals 1800 units.\n\nNext, I'll calculate Tuesday's production. If it produced 25% less than its daily production, that means it produced 1200 minus 25% of 1200.\n\nSo, 25% of 1200 is 0.25 times 1200, which is 300. Therefore, Tuesday's production is 1200 minus 300, which equals 900 units.\n\nNow, to find the total production for Monday and Tuesday, I'll add the two amounts together: 1800 plus 900 equals 2700 units.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of Monday's production as 150% of the daily production, since it's 50% more. So, 150% of 1200 is 1.5 times 1200, which is indeed 1800.\n\nSimilarly, Tuesday's production is 75% of the daily production, since it's 25% less. So, 75% of 1200 is 0.75 times 1200, which is 900.\n\nAdding those together, 1800 plus 900 is 2700.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Maybe I can try another method to confirm.\n\nLet's consider the total production over the two days as the sum of Monday and Tuesday's production.\n\nMonday: 1200 + (0.5 * 1200) = 1200 + 600 = 1800\n\nTuesday: 1200 - (0.25 * 1200) = 1200 - 300 = 900\n\nTotal: 1800 + 900 = 2700\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of multiples:\n\nMonday: 1.5 * 1200 = 1800\n\nTuesday: 0.75 * 1200 = 900\n\nTotal: 1.5 + 0.75 = 2.25, then 2.25 * 1200 = 2700\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nI think that's the correct total production for Monday and Tuesday combined.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2700} \\]"
