        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bags of candy. The average weight is 250 grams per bag, and the standard deviation is 20 grams. It says the weights are normally distributed, and I need to find out what percentage of bags weigh between 230 and 270 grams. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a normal distribution is. I know that in a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. The mean, median, and mode are all the same, which in this case is 250 grams. The standard deviation tells me how spread out the weights are. A smaller standard deviation means the weights are closer to the mean, and a larger one means they're more spread out.\n\nSo, here, the mean (\u03bc) is 250 grams, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 20 grams. I need to find the percentage of bags that weigh between 230 and 270 grams. In terms of the normal distribution, this means I need to find the area under the curve between these two weights.\n\nTo do that, I can use the z-score formula to standardize the values and then use a z-table or a calculator to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the value I'm interested in.\n\nFirst, let's find the z-score for 230 grams:\n\nz1 = (230 - 250) / 20 = (-20) / 20 = -1\n\nNext, the z-score for 270 grams:\n\nz2 = (270 - 250) / 20 = (20) / 20 = 1\n\nSo, I need to find the area under the standard normal curve between z = -1 and z = 1.\n\nI remember that the standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The z-scores tell me how many standard deviations away from the mean a particular value is.\n\nNow, to find the area between z = -1 and z = 1, I can look up the cumulative probabilities for these z-scores in a standard normal table or use a calculator.\n\nUsing a z-table, I find that:\n\nFor z = 1, the cumulative probability is approximately 0.8413. This means that 84.13% of the data lies below z = 1.\n\nFor z = -1, the cumulative probability is approximately 0.1587. This means that 15.87% of the data lies below z = -1.\n\nTo find the area between z = -1 and z = 1, I subtract the smaller cumulative probability from the larger one:\n\nArea = P(z < 1) - P(z < -1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, approximately 68.26% of the bags weigh between 230 and 270 grams.\n\nWait a minute, that seems familiar. I think there's a rule of thumb in normal distributions that about 68% of the data lies within one standard deviation of the mean. Yes, that's right. In a normal distribution:\n\n- Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (\u03c3) of the mean (\u03bc).\n\n- About 95% falls within two standard deviations.\n\n- And about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n\nSo, in this case, since 230 grams is one standard deviation below the mean (250 - 20 = 230), and 270 grams is one standard deviation above the mean (250 + 20 = 270), it makes sense that approximately 68% of the bags fall within this weight range.\n\nBut let's double-check my calculations to be sure. Using the z-scores:\n\nz1 = -1 \u2192 cumulative probability = 0.1587\n\nz2 = 1 \u2192 cumulative probability = 0.8413\n\nDifference: 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826, or 68.26%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the empirical rule, which states that for a normal distribution:\n\n- Approximately 68% of data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\n- Approximately 95% falls within two standard deviations.\n\n- Approximately 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n\nGiven that, since 230 and 270 grams are exactly one standard deviation below and above the mean, respectively, the empirical rule directly gives me that about 68% of the bags weigh between 230 and 270 grams.\n\nSo, both the z-score calculation and the empirical rule lead me to the same conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor I should account for. Is the distribution perfectly normal? The problem says to assume a normal distribution, so I can proceed with that assumption.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Here, everything is in grams, so that's fine.\n\nMoreover, I should confirm that the z-table I'm using is for the standard normal distribution. Yes, it is.\n\nLet me also consider if the bags' weights can be less than 0 grams. But since the mean is 250 grams and the standard deviation is 20 grams, the distribution extends from approximately 250 - 3*20 = 190 grams to 250 + 3*20 = 310 grams, which is well above 0 grams. So, no need to worry about negative weights.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the percentage of bags weighing between 230 and 270 grams is approximately 68.26%, which aligns with the empirical rule's approximation of 68%.\n\nSo, the final answer is that about 68.26% of the bags weigh between 230 and 270 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{68.26\\%} \\]"
