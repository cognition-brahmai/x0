        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from station A to station B at 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours. That means the distance between A and B is speed times time, so 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nNow, it's coming back from B to A, and its speed is increased by 50%. So, 50% of 60 miles per hour is 30 miles per hour. Therefore, the new speed is 60 plus 30, which is 90 miles per hour.\n\nWe need to find out how long it takes to travel the same distance of 120 miles at this new speed of 90 miles per hour.\n\nTime is equal to distance divided by speed, so 120 miles divided by 90 miles per hour.\n\nLet me calculate that: 120 divided by 90 is 1.333... hours.\n\nTo make it more understandable, 0.333 hours is like 20 minutes because 0.333 times 60 minutes is approximately 20 minutes.\n\nSo, the time it takes is 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of ratios. If the speed increases by 50%, the time should decrease by what factor?\n\nSpeed and time are inversely proportional when distance is constant.\n\nSo, if speed increases by a factor of 1.5 (which is 50% increase), time should decrease by a factor of 1.5.\n\nOriginal time was 2 hours, so new time is 2 divided by 1.5.\n\n2 divided by 1.5 is indeed 1.333... hours, which is 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour and } 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
