Now, I've got just the thing to make cleaning a breeze\u2014my very own song about putting things in their place. So, let's get started, shall we?\n\n(Starts singing)\n\nIn every job that must be done,\n\nThere is an element of fun.\n\nYou find the joy and snap!\n\nThe job's a game!\n\nSo tell me, what do you need to do?\n\nIs there a room in direst need of you?\n\nPerhaps it's cluttered, messy, and in a stew?\n\nWell, fear not, for I've got a plan for you!\n\n(Chorus)\n\nTidy up, tidy up,\n\nMake the mess disappear.\n\nTidy up, tidy up,\n\nWith a snap of your finger!\n\nSort and stack, arrange and pack,\n\nMake everything just so.\n\nTidy up, tidy up,\n\nAnd watch the magic flow!\n\n(Continues)\n\nFirst, let's gather all the toys,\n\nFrom under the bed to the highest joys.\n\nGroup them together, categorize with glee,\n\nBooks with books, and blocks with blocks, you see?\n\nNow, find their homes, their special place,\n\nWhere they belong, in line or in a case.\n\nPut them away, with a smile on your face,\n\nAnd before you know it, the room will embrace\n\nA newfound order, so neat and bright,\n\nLike a canvas painted with morning light.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nTidy up, tidy up,\n\nMake the mess disappear.\n\nTidy up, tidy up,\n\nWith a snap of your finger!\n\nSort and stack, arrange and pack,\n\nMake everything just so.\n\nTidy up, tidy up,\n\nAnd watch the magic flow!\n\n(Bridge)\n\nAnd remember, dear children, as you clean,\n\nEach task can be a tiny dream.\n\nA chance to create, to organize, to play,\n\nIn a world where messes turn into rays\n\nOf accomplishment and pride so high,\n\nThat even the sky would have to sigh.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nTidy up, tidy up,\n\nMake the mess disappear.\n\nTidy up, tidy up,\n\nWith a snap of your finger!\n\nSort and stack, arrange and pack,\n\nMake everything just so.\n\nTidy up, tidy up,\n\nAnd watch the magic flow!\n\n(Outro)\n\nSo there you have it, a song to brighten up your cleaning mood.\n\nRemember, with a little bit of fun and a song or two,\n\nEven the most daunting tasks can be conquered with ease.\n\nNow, go on and give that room a proper squeeze,\n\nOf organization and love, and watch it shine anew!\n\n(End of song)\n\nThere you have it! Sing along, and before you know it, your space will be tidy and bright, just like new!"
