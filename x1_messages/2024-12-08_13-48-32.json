        "content": "So the national sports league wants to expand from 30 to 36 teams over five years, and they're looking at the potential increase in annual revenue from this expansion. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, they're adding 6 new teams, right? From 30 to 36 is an increase of 6 teams.\n\nEach team plays 82 games per season, with half of those being home games. So, each team has 41 home games per season.\n\nThe average ticket price is $50, and each arena has an average capacity of 18,000 spectators.\n\nAdditionally, there's merchandise sales to consider, with an average spend of $25 per spectator.\n\nSo, to find the potential increase in annual revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from ticket sales and merchandise for the new teams and then sum those up.\n\nLet's start with ticket sales.\n\nFor each new team:\n\nNumber of home games per season = 41\n\nCapacity per game = 18,000 spectators\n\nTicket price = $50\n\nSo, revenue from ticket sales per game = 18,000 * $50 = $900,000\n\nRevenue from ticket sales per season = 41 * $900,000 = $36,900,000\n\nNow, for merchandise sales:\n\nAverage spend per spectator = $25\n\nSo, merchandise revenue per game = 18,000 * $25 = $450,000\n\nMerchandise revenue per season = 41 * $450,000 = $18,450,000\n\nTherefore, total revenue per new team per season = ticket sales + merchandise = $36,900,000 + $18,450,000 = $55,350,000\n\nSince there are 6 new teams, the total additional revenue per season would be 6 * $55,350,000 = $332,100,000\n\nBut the question asks for annual revenue. Now, assuming that the season is one year, then this would be the annual revenue increase.\n\nHowever, sometimes sports seasons are shorter than a year. For example, if the season is 8 months long, you might need to prorate this to annual revenue. But since the question says \"annual revenue generated by the addition of these new teams,\" and it mentions \"per season,\" I think it's safe to assume that the season is considered annual.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm whether the 82 games per season are spread over a year or less. If it's less than a year, we might need to annualize the revenue.\n\nLet me check. In many sports leagues, like the NBA or NHL, a season is about 82 games and lasts from October to April, which is around 7 months. So, if the season is 7 months, and they're generating $332,100,000 in that period, then to find the annual revenue, we would need to annualize this figure.\n\nLet's assume the season is 7 months long.\n\nSo, monthly revenue = $332,100,000 / 7 months \u2248 $47,442,857 per month\n\nThen, annual revenue = $47,442,857 * 12 months \u2248 $569,314,285\n\nHowever, this assumes that the arenas are inactive during the off-season, which might not be the case. Perhaps they host other events during the off-season, but since that's not specified, I'll proceed with the annualized figure based on the season's duration.\n\nAlternatively, if the league spreads the season over the entire year, then the initial calculation of $332,100,000 per season would be the annual revenue.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify the length of the season in terms of months, I'll consider both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: Season is 82 games, lasting one year.\n\nTherefore, additional annual revenue = $332,100,000\n\nApproach 2: Season is 82 games, lasting 7 months.\n\nMonthly revenue = $332,100,000 / 7 \u2248 $47,442,857\n\nAnnual revenue = $47,442,857 * 12 \u2248 $569,314,285\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest approach is to use the initial calculation, assuming the season is considered annual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 82 games are spread over a year, making the initial calculation sufficient.\n\nTo double-check, let's look at real-world examples. In the NBA, a team plays 82 games over about 6 months. Similarly, in the NHL, it's 82 games over about 6 months. So, if we consider a 6-month season, then annualizing the revenue would be necessary.\n\nLet's recalculate based on a 6-month season.\n\nMonthly revenue = $332,100,000 / 6 \u2248 $55,350,000 per month\n\nAnnual revenue = $55,350,000 * 12 = $664,200,000\n\nThis seems higher than before, so perhaps the initial assumption of a 7-month season was closer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the league will adjust the schedule so that the expanded number of teams allows for a longer season or overlapping schedules.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, perhaps the most straightforward approach is to use the initial calculation, assuming the season is considered annual.\n\nTherefore, the potential increase in annual revenue generated by the addition of these new teams is approximately $332,100,000.\n\nHowever, this doesn't take into account any additional costs that may be associated with adding new teams, such as stadium construction, operational costs, player salaries, etc. But since the question only asks for the potential increase in annual revenue from ticket sales and merchandise, we can stop here.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps we should consider attendance rates. It's unlikely that every game will sell out. So, perhaps we should include an attendance rate less than 100%.\n\nLet's assume an average attendance rate of 90%.\n\nTherefore, average spectators per game = 18,000 * 0.9 = 16,200\n\nThen, ticket sales per game = 16,200 * $50 = $810,000\n\nTicket sales per season = 41 * $810,000 = $33,210,000\n\nMerchandise sales per game = 16,200 * $25 = $405,000\n\nMerchandise sales per season = 41 * $405,000 = $16,560,000\n\nTotal revenue per new team per season = $33,210,000 + $16,560,000 = $49,770,000\n\nFor 6 new teams: 6 * $49,770,000 = $298,620,000\n\nAgain, assuming a 6-month season:\n\nMonthly revenue = $298,620,000 / 6 = $49,770,000\n\nAnnual revenue = $49,770,000 * 12 = $597,240,000\n\nAlternatively, treating the season as annual: annual revenue = $298,620,000\n\nThis is significantly lower than the initial calculation, highlighting the importance of considering attendance rates.\n\nMoreover, merchandise sales might not be directly proportional to attendance, as some fans might purchase merchandise online or in other settings. However, for simplicity, we'll keep it proportional to attendance.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that newer teams might have lower attendance initially as they build their fan base. Perhaps over the five-year period, attendance increases gradually.\n\nBut since the question asks for the potential increase in annual revenue, and doesn't specify any ramp-up period, I'll proceed with the attendance-based calculation.\n\nTherefore, with an attendance rate of 90%, the potential increase in annual revenue is approximately $298,620,000.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the season to be 6 months long, the annualized revenue would be around $597,240,000.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, perhaps it's best to provide both figures, noting the assumption about the season length.\n\nAdditionally, inflation and other economic factors could affect ticket prices and merchandise sales over the five-year expansion period, but since the question doesn't specify, I'll keep the calculations in current dollars.\n\nAlso, the league might implement revenue-sharing models or other financial arrangements that could affect the distribution of revenue among teams, but again, since the question is about the potential increase in annual revenue generated by the addition of new teams, I think the above calculations suffice.\n\nIn conclusion, assuming a 100% attendance rate, the potential increase in annual revenue is approximately $332,100,000. With a more realistic 90% attendance rate, it's around $298,620,000. If the season is considered to be 6 months long, the annualized revenue would be higher, around $597,240,000.\n\nHowever, to provide a single figure, I'll go with the attendance-adjusted annual revenue of approximately $300 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{300\\text{ million dollars}}"
