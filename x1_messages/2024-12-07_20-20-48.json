        "content": "Let's see. The train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 km/h and it takes 3 hours. So, the distance between Town A and Town B should be speed multiplied by time, right? That would be 60 km/h times 3 hours, which is 180 kilometers.\n\nNow, on the return trip, the train travels at 80 km/h. I need to find out how long it takes to cover the same 180 kilometers back to Town A.\n\nTime is equal to distance divided by speed, isn't it? So, time equals 180 km divided by 80 km/h. Let me do the math: 180 divided by 80 is 2.25 hours.\n\nBut 2.25 hours is 2 hours and 0.25 of an hour. Since 0.25 hour is 15 minutes, the total time for the return trip is 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nWait, but maybe I should express it in minutes only for clarity. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 15 minutes, so 135 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, keeping it in hours, 2.25 hours is fine.\n\nI think the answer is 2.25 hours or 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.25 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
