        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company charges $20 per day for renting a car, and an additional $0.15 for each mile driven. The customer has a budget of $100 for a one-day rental. I need to find out how many miles they can drive without exceeding their budget.\n\nFirst, I should understand the total cost structure. The total cost consists of a fixed daily fee and a variable cost based on the miles driven. The fixed fee is $20 for one day, and the variable cost is $0.15 per mile.\n\nSo, the total cost (C) can be expressed as:\n\nC = fixed fee + (cost per mile \u00d7 number of miles)\n\nGiven that the budget is $100, I need to set up an equation where C \u2264 $100.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of miles driven as m.\n\nTherefore:\n\n20 + 0.15m \u2264 100\n\nNow, I need to solve for m.\n\nFirst, subtract 20 from both sides:\n\n0.15m \u2264 80\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.15:\n\nm \u2264 80 / 0.15\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n80 divided by 0.15.\n\nWell, 0.15 times what equals 80?\n\nAlternatively, 80 divided by 0.15 is the same as 80 divided by 3/20, because 0.15 is 3/20.\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\nSo, 80 divided by 3/20 is 80 \u00d7 (20/3).\n\nLet\u2019s compute that:\n\n80 \u00d7 20 = 1600\n\n1600 divided by 3 is approximately 533.333...\n\nSo, m \u2264 533.333...\n\nSince the number of miles can't be a fraction, I should consider that driving 533 miles would cost:\n\n20 + 0.15 \u00d7 533 = 20 + 79.95 = $99.95, which is within the budget.\n\nDriving 534 miles would cost:\n\n20 + 0.15 \u00d7 534 = 20 + 80.10 = $100.10, which exceeds the budget.\n\nTherefore, the customer can drive up to 533 miles without exceeding their $100 budget.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{533} \\]"
