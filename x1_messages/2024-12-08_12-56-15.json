        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company charges a flat fee of $20 per day and an additional 15 cents per mile driven. The customer rents the car for 3 days and drives it for 120 miles. I need to calculate the total charge.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for the number of days rented. The flat fee is $20 per day, and the customer rents the car for 3 days. So, the cost for the days rented is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost for days} = 20 \\, \\text{USD/day} \\times 3 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost for the miles driven. The charge is 15 cents per mile, and the customer drives 120 miles. So, the cost for the miles driven is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost for miles} = 0.15 \\, \\text{USD/mile} \\times 120 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nFinally, I'll add these two amounts together to get the total charge.\n\nLet me do the math step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost for the days:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the cost for the miles:\n\n\\[ 0.15 \\times 120 = 18 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\nNow, add these two amounts:\n\n\\[ 60 + 18 = 78 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\nSo, the total charge for renting the car for 3 days and driving 120 miles is $78.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78} \\]"
