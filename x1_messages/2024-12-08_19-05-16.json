        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 12 marbles: 6 red, 4 blue, and 2 green. I need to draw 3 marbles without replacement, and I want to find the probability that I get at least one marble of each color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least one of each color\" means. Since there are three colors and I'm drawing three marbles, \"at least one of each color\" in this case actually means exactly one of each color because it's impossible to have more than one of each color when drawing three marbles.\n\nSo, I need to find the probability of drawing one red, one blue, and one green marble in any order.\n\nTo find this probability, I can use the formula for probability:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm drawing 3 marbles out of 12 without replacement, the total number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{12}{3} \\]\n\nI know that \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so:\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12!}{3!(12 - 3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!} \\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 9! in the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9!}{3! \\times 9!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3!} \\]\n\nAnd since 3! = 6:\n\n\\[ \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{6} = 220 \\]\n\nSo, there are 220 possible ways to draw 3 marbles from 12.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw one marble of each color.\n\nThere are 6 red, 4 blue, and 2 green marbles.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red marble is \\(\\binom{6}{1} = 6\\).\n\nThe number of ways to choose one blue marble is \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\).\n\nThe number of ways to choose one green marble is \\(\\binom{2}{1} = 2\\).\n\nSince these choices are independent, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these:\n\n\\[ \\text{Favorable combinations} = 6 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, I can find the probability:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{48}{220} \\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n\\[ \\frac{48 \\div 4}{220 \\div 4} = \\frac{12}{55} \\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{12}{55}\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer?\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the problem in terms of permutations, considering the order in which the marbles are drawn.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles in order from 12 is:\n\n\\[ P(12, 3) = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 1320 \\]\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, I need to draw one of each color in any order.\n\nFirst, consider the number of ways to draw one red, one blue, and one green in a specific order, say red first, then blue, then green:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 48 \\]\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible orders in which one of each color can be drawn. There are 3! = 6 possible orders:\n\n1. Red, blue, green\n\n2. Red, green, blue\n\n3. Blue, red, green\n\n4. Blue, green, red\n\n5. Green, red, blue\n\n6. Green, blue, red\n\nSo, the total number of favorable permutations is:\n\n\\[ 48 \\times 6 = 288 \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because in my earlier combination approach, I had 48 favorable outcomes, and now I'm getting 288 if I consider permutations.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen using combinations, order doesn't matter, which is appropriate here since the problem doesn't specify order.\n\nIn the combination approach, I correctly calculated the number of ways to choose one of each color without regard to order: 6 red \u00d7 4 blue \u00d7 2 green = 48 favorable combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 3 marbles from 12 is 220.\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\frac{48}{220} = \\frac{12}{55}\\).\n\nIf I were to use permutations, I would need to consider the order in both numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, total permutations of drawing 3 marbles from 12 is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 = 1320.\n\nFor favorable permutations, I need to consider all possible orders of drawing one of each color.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of ways to draw one of each color in a specific order, say red then blue then green: 6 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 = 48.\n\nSince there are 6 possible orders (3!), the total number of favorable permutations is 48 \u00d7 6 = 288.\n\nTherefore, the probability would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{288}{1320} \\]\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 24:\n\n\\[ \\frac{288 \\div 24}{1320 \\div 24} = \\frac{12}{55} \\]\n\nSo, I get the same answer as with the combination approach.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{12}{55}\\).\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step, considering the draws one at a time without replacement.\n\nFirst draw: any color is fine, as long as the subsequent draws make up for the other two colors.\n\nBut this approach might be more complicated. I think the combination approach is simpler and less error-prone for this problem.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another method: calculating the probability directly using probabilities of drawing specific colors in sequence, and then summing over all possible sequences.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence red, blue, green:\n\nProbability of first draw red: \\(\\frac{6}{12}\\)\n\nThen, probability of second draw blue: \\(\\frac{4}{11}\\)\n\nThen, probability of third draw green: \\(\\frac{2}{10}\\)\n\nSo, the probability for this specific sequence is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6}{12} \\times \\frac{4}{11} \\times \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{11} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{110} = \\frac{2}{55} \\]\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence red, green, blue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6}{12} \\times \\frac{2}{11} \\times \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{11} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{4}{110} = \\frac{2}{55} \\]\n\nAnd so on for all six possible sequences. Each sequence will have the same probability of \\(\\frac{2}{55}\\).\n\nTherefore, the total probability is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times \\frac{2}{55} = \\frac{12}{55} \\]\n\nAgain, this matches my previous result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the probability is \\(\\frac{12}{55}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{12}{55}} \\]"
