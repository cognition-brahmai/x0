Let's start by figuring out who the architect is.\n\nFirst, I should probably search for information about the Sydney Opera House to find out who designed it. I can use the DuckDuckGo tool for this, as it will give me a list of websites that might have the information I need.\n\nSo, my first step is:\n\nPlan: Search for information about the Sydney Opera House design.\n\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"Who designed the Sydney Opera House?\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to pick the most relevant links to check for the information. I can use the URLPicker tool to extract the URLs from the search results.\n\nPlan: Pick the most relevant URLs from the search results.\n\n:evidence1: = URLPicker[:evidence0:]\n\nNext, I need to load the content from these URLs to read the information. The PageLoader tool can help me with that.\n\nPlan: Load the content from the selected URLs.\n\n:evidence2: = PageLoader[:evidence1:]\n\nNow, with the content from these pages, I need to find out who designed the Sydney Opera House. I can use the InfoBot tool to ask a question based on the provided text.\n\nPlan: Identify the architect of the Sydney Opera House from the loaded pages.\n\n:evidence3: = InfoBot[\"Who designed the Sydney Opera House, given :evidence2:?\"]\n\nAssuming I get the architect's name from :evidence3:, I need to find out what other buildings this architect designed. I should search for the architect's name along with \"buildings designed\" or something similar.\n\nPlan: Search for other buildings designed by the architect.\n\n:evidence4: = DuckDuckGo[\"Buildings designed by \" + :evidence3:]\n\nAgain, I need to pick relevant URLs from these search results.\n\nPlan: Pick relevant URLs from the second search.\n\n:evidence5: = URLPicker[:evidence4:]\n\nLoad the content from these new URLs.\n\nPlan: Load the content from the selected URLs.\n\n:evidence6: = PageLoader[:evidence5:]\n\nFinally, use the InfoBot to list other buildings designed by the architect.\n\nPlan: Find other buildings designed by the architect.\n\n:evidence7: = InfoBot[\"What other buildings did \" + :evidence3 + \" design, given :evidence6:?\"]\n\nNow, compile the information: the name of the architect and the list of other buildings they designed.\n\nPlan: Compile the final answer.\n\nAnswer: :evidence3: designed the Sydney Opera House and also designed :evidence7:.\n\n**Final Output**\n\nTo answer the question \"Who designed the Sydney Opera House and what other buildings did they design?\", follow this step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Search for information about the Sydney Opera House design.**\n   - Use the DuckDuckGo tool to search for \"Who designed the Sydney Opera House?\"\n   - :evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[\"Who designed the Sydney Opera House?\"]\n\n2. **Pick the most relevant URLs from the search results.**\n   - Use the URLPicker tool to extract URLs from the search results.\n   - :evidence1: = URLPicker[:evidence0:]\n\n3. **Load the content from the selected URLs.**\n   - Use the PageLoader tool to load the text content from the extracted URLs.\n   - :evidence2: = PageLoader[:evidence1:]\n\n4. **Identify the architect of the Sydney Opera House from the loaded pages.**\n   - Use the InfoBot tool to ask \"Who designed the Sydney Opera House, given :evidence2:?\"\n   - :evidence3: = InfoBot[\"Who designed the Sydney Opera House, given :evidence2:?\"]\n\n5. **Search for other buildings designed by the architect.**\n   - Use the DuckDuckGo tool to search for \"Buildings designed by \" plus the architect's name obtained in :evidence3:.\n   - :evidence4: = DuckDuckGo[\"Buildings designed by \" + :evidence3:]\n\n6. **Pick relevant URLs from the second search.**\n   - Use the URLPicker tool to extract URLs from the second search results.\n   - :evidence5: = URLPicker[:evidence4:]\n\n7. **Load the content from these new URLs.**\n   - Use the PageLoader tool to load the text content from the extracted URLs.\n   - :evidence6: = PageLoader[:evidence5:]\n\n8. **Find other buildings designed by the architect.**\n   - Use the InfoBot tool to ask \"What other buildings did \" plus the architect's name \" design, given :evidence6:?\"\n   - :evidence7: = InfoBot[\"What other buildings did \" + :evidence3 + \" design, given :evidence6:?\"]\n\n9. **Compile the final answer.**\n   - The architect's name is in :evidence3: and the list of other buildings is in :evidence7:.\n   - Answer: :evidence3: designed the Sydney Opera House and also designed :evidence7:.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n:evidence3: designed the Sydney Opera House and also designed :evidence7:."
