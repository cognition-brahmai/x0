        "content": "So in this class, there are 35 students in total, and out of those, 15 are boys. The rest are girls. So, first, I need to find out how many girls there are.\n\nTo do that, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\nGirls = Total students - Boys\n\nGirls = 35 - 15 = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 girls in the class.\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of boys to girls. The ratio is a way to compare two quantities by division.\n\nSo, the ratio of boys to girls is:\n\nBoys : Girls = 15 : 20\n\nNow, ratios can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 15 and 20 is 5.\n\nSo, dividing both numbers by 5:\n\n15 \u00f7 5 = 3\n\n20 \u00f7 5 = 4\n\nTherefore, the simplified ratio of boys to girls is 3:4.\n\nAlternatively, ratios can also be expressed as fractions. So, the ratio 3:4 can also be written as 3/4.\n\nBut in ratio notation, we usually write it as 3:4.\n\nSo, the ratio of boys to girls in the class is 3:4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:4} \\]"
