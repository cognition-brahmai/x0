        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a train travels between two cities at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour. The trip takes 6 hours and 45 minutes. I need to find out the distance between the two cities.\n\nOkay, so I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nGiven that the speed is 80 kilometers per hour, I need to find out what the time is in hours because the unit for speed is kilometers per hour.\n\nThe time given is 6 hours and 45 minutes. Now, I need to convert this into hours. I know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ 45 \\div 60 = 0.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the total time in hours is:\n\n\\[ 6 + 0.75 = 6.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 80 \\times 6.75 \\]\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\nFirst, 80 times 6 is 480.\n\nThen, 80 times 0.75 is 60.\n\nSo, 480 plus 60 equals 540.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two cities is 540 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the time entirely into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 6 hours is 360 minutes, plus 45 minutes, which totals 405 minutes.\n\nThen, since the speed is 80 kilometers per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, I could find out how many kilometers the train travels per minute.\n\n\\[ 80 \\div 60 = \\frac{80}{60} = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ kilometers per minute} \\]\n\nSo, the train travels \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) kilometers each minute.\n\nNow, over 405 minutes, the distance would be:\n\n\\[ 405 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 405 divided by 3 is 135.\n\nThen, 135 times 4 is 540.\n\nSo, again, I get 540 kilometers.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, I think 540 kilometers is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I use the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[ \\text{average speed} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}} \\]\n\nGiven that the average speed is 80 kilometers per hour, and the total time is 6.75 hours, I can rearrange the formula to solve for distance:\n\n\\[ \\text{total distance} = \\text{average speed} \\times \\text{total time} \\]\n\nWhich is the same as the first formula I used. So, again, it leads me to:\n\n\\[ \\text{total distance} = 80 \\times 6.75 = 540 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The distance between the two cities is 540 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{540} \\]"
