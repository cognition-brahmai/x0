So, initially, the total number of people in the town would be:\n\n20 houses * 4 people per house = 80 people\n\nNow, 5 families move out, and each family has 3 members. So, the total number of people moving out is:\n\n5 families * 3 members per family = 15 people\n\nTo find out how many people are left in the town, we subtract the number of people who moved out from the initial total:\n\n80 people - 15 people = 65 people\n\nTherefore, there are 65 people left in the town.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]"
