        "content": "The 1994 film you're referring to is \"Pulp Fiction,\" directed by Quentin Tarantino. In this iconic movie, there's a memorable dance scene where John Travolta's character, Vincent Vega, and Uma Thurman's character, Mia Wallace, slow dance to \"You Never Can Tell\" by Chuck Berry at Jack Rabbit Slim's, a 1950s-themed restaurant and nightclub. This scene is not only a standout moment in the film but also a cultural touchstone that has been widely referenced and parodied over the years."
