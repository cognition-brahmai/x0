        "content": "Zaitsev's rule is used to predict the outcome of elimination reactions in organic chemistry. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Elimination reactions.\n\nTo provide some additional context, Zaitsev's rule, also known as Saytzeff's rule, states that when an elimination reaction occurs, the major product will be the alkene with the most highly substituted double bond. In other words, the hydrogen atom is preferentially removed from the carbon atom that has the fewest hydrogen atoms attached to it, leading to the formation of the more stable alkene.\n\nThis rule is particularly applicable to E2 and E1 elimination reactions, where a base removes a proton from a molecule, and a leaving group departs, resulting in the formation of a double bond.\n\nFor example, in the dehydration of 2-methyl-2-butanol, according to Zaitsev's rule, the major product would be 2-methyl-2-butene, which is the more highly substituted alkene, rather than 2-methyl-1-butene.\n\nIt's important to note that while Zaitsev's rule is generally reliable for predicting the major product in elimination reactions, there are exceptions and other factors that can influence the product distribution, such as steric hindrance, solvent effects, and the nature of the base or acid used in the reaction.\n\nIn summary, Zaitsev's rule is a guiding principle for predicting the products of elimination reactions in organic chemistry, specifically helping to determine which alkene is formed preferentially based on the degree of substitution of the double bond."
