        "content": "So the factory makes 500 widgets each day, and we want to know how many it will make in 45 days, right? And it's working every day without stopping. Okay, so this seems like a straightforward multiplication problem.\n\nI think I should just multiply the daily production by the number of days. So, 500 widgets per day times 45 days. Let me do that.\n\n500 times 45. Hmm, let's see. 500 times 40 is 20,000, and 500 times 5 is 2,500. So, 20,000 plus 2,500 equals 22,500.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me check again. 500 times 45.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 45 as 45 = 50 - 5. So, 500 times 50 is 25,000, and 500 times 5 is 2,500. Then, 25,000 minus 2,500 is 22,500. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to verify is to divide the total by the number of days to see if I get back to the daily production. So, 22,500 divided by 45 should be 500.\n\nLet's see: 45 times 500 is 22,500. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 22,500 widgets in 45 days.\n\nBut wait, the question says the factory operates continuously without any breaks or holidays. Does that mean anything for our calculation? I think we've already accounted for that by assuming it works every day.\n\nIs there any other factor we should consider? Like, maybe machine breakdowns or maintenance, but the question says it operates continuously without breaks or holidays. So, I think it's safe to assume that production is constant every day.\n\nAlright, so my final answer is 22,500 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22500} \\]"
