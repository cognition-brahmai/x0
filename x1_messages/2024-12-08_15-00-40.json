The game was created by Elizabeth Magie in 1903 as a tool to demonstrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. However, over time, it evolved into the version we know today, focusing more on capitalism and property acquisition. It's interesting how games can have such profound underlying messages."
