        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to create a simple vending machine simulation in GoLang based on your description. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, the vending machine should have an inventory of products, each with a specific price. So, I need to define a structure for products, probably something like:\n\n```go\ntype Product struct {\n    Name  string\n    Price int // Let's use cents to avoid floating point issues\n}\n```\n\nThen, I need to have a map or a slice to hold these products, maybe indexed by a unique ID or name.\n\nNext, the user should be able to insert coins into the machine. So, I need to keep track of the total amount inserted. Maybe have a variable like `insertedCoins` that accumulates the value of the coins inserted.\n\nWhen the user selects a product, the machine needs to check if the `insertedCoins` is enough to cover the product's price. If it is, dispense the product and calculate the change if any. If not, display an error message.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the scenario where too much money is inserted and return the change.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the program. Maybe have a `VendingMachine` struct that holds the inventory and the current inserted coins.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```go\ntype VendingMachine struct {\n    Inventory       map[string]Product\n    insertedCoins   int\n}\n```\n\nI'll need methods for inserting coins, selecting a product, and probably resetting the machine.\n\nLet's sketch out some method signatures:\n\n- `InsertCoin(amount int)` to add to the insertedCoins.\n\n- `SelectProduct(productName string)` to check if the product exists, if there's enough money, dispense it and calculate change.\n\n- Maybe a `ReturnChange()` to get any remaining money without selecting a product.\n\nI should also consider error handling, like invalid product names, insufficient funds, etc.\n\nLet me think about the flow:\n\n1. User inserts coins one by one using `InsertCoin`.\n\n2. User selects a product using `SelectProduct`.\n\n3. If enough money was inserted, dispense the product and calculate change.\n\n4. If not enough money, show an error.\n\n5. Option to get change back without selecting a product.\n\nI should also decide on the coin denominations. For simplicity, let's assume we have coins of 1, 5, 10, 25 cents.\n\nNow, about the inventory. Should I keep track of stock levels? For simplicity, let's assume there's infinite stock for each product.\n\nWait, but in a real vending machine, products can sell out. Maybe I should include stock levels.\n\nLet me update the `Product` struct:\n\n```go\ntype Product struct {\n    Name  string\n    Price int\n    Stock int\n}\n```\n\nAnd in `VendingMachine`, when selecting a product, check if stock is greater than zero.\n\nIf stock is zero, display \"Sold out\".\n\nAlright, now for the change calculation. If the user inserts more money than the product costs, I need to calculate the change.\n\nI need to decide how to represent the change. Maybe as a map of coin denominations to the number of each coin.\n\nFor example:\n\n```go\ntype Change struct {\n    Coins map[int]int // key is denomination, value is count\n}\n```\n\nThen, in `SelectProduct`, if there's change to be returned, calculate it and display it.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate the change. I can use the greedy algorithm for coin change.\n\nSo, starting with the highest denomination, subtract as many coins as possible without going over the change amount.\n\nRepeat for lower denominations.\n\nIn Go, I can define the denominations in a slice in descending order, like [25, 10, 5, 1].\n\nThen iterate through them, calculating how many of each to give.\n\nNow, let's think about the user interface. Since this is a command-line program, I need to read inputs from the console.\n\nI can use `fmt.Scan` or `bufio.Scanner` to read user inputs.\n\nMaybe have a loop that keeps running until the user decides to exit.\n\nIn each iteration, display a menu:\n\n- Insert coin\n\n- Select product\n\n- Get change\n\n- Exit\n\nFor inserting coins, prompt the user to enter the coin value.\n\nFor selecting a product, list available products with their names and prices.\n\nWait, but to list available products, I need to display the inventory.\n\nMaybe have another option: \"List products\"\n\nThen, when selecting a product, user enters the product name.\n\nIf product exists, check if stock is available and if enough money was inserted.\n\nIf yes, dispense the product, decrease the stock by one, calculate change if any.\n\nIf not enough money, show how much more is needed.\n\nIf product is out of stock, show \"Sold out\".\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where user inserts coins but doesn't select a product, and then exits. In that case, the inserted coins should be returned.\n\nMaybe have a \"Cancel\" option to return the inserted coins without selecting a product.\n\nAlright, let's outline the steps for the program:\n\n1. Initialize a `VendingMachine` with some products and stock levels.\n\n2. Display a menu:\n\n- Insert coin\n\n- Select product\n\n- List products\n\n- Cancel (return change)\n\n- Exit\n\n3. Based on user choice, perform the corresponding action.\n\n4. For inserting coins, add to `insertedCoins`.\n\n5. For selecting a product, check if product exists, has stock, and if enough money was inserted.\n\n6. If yes, dispense product, decrease stock, calculate and display change if any.\n\n7. If not enough money, show required amount.\n\n8. If product is out of stock, show \"Sold out\".\n\n9. For listing products, display all products with names and prices.\n\n10. For canceling, return all inserted coins and reset the machine.\n\n11. For exiting, if there are inserted coins, give the option to cancel first.\n\nI need to make sure that the machine's state is reset properly when canceling or exiting.\n\nAlso, need to handle invalid inputs, like inserting invalid coin denominations or typing wrong product names.\n\nLet me think about the data for the products. Maybe have a few sample products:\n\n- Soda: $1.25\n\n- Chips: $0.75\n\n- Candy: $0.50\n\n- Water: $1.00\n\nConvert these prices to cents: 125, 75, 50, 100.\n\nInitialize the inventory with these products and some stock levels, say 5 for each.\n\nNow, for the change calculation, using the greedy algorithm should work fine for US coin denominations.\n\nBut to make it more general, maybe allow for different denominations.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's stick with standard US coins: 1, 5, 10, 25 cents.\n\nImplement the greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum number of coins for the change.\n\nLet me write a helper function for that:\n\n```go\nfunc calculateChange(change int) map[int]int {\n    denominations := []int{25, 10, 5, 1}\n    coins := make(map[int]int)\n    for _, denom := range denominations {\n        coins[denom] = change / denom\n        change %= denom\n    }\n    return coins\n}\n```\n\nThis function will return a map with the number of each coin needed to make up the change.\n\nThen, in the `SelectProduct` method, if there's change to be returned, call this function and display the change.\n\nNow, for the user interface, I'll use `bufio.Scanner` to read inputs.\n\nLet me sketch the main loop:\n\n```go\nscanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)\nfor {\n    displayMenu()\n    fmt.Print(\"Enter your choice: \")\n    scanner.Scan()\n    choice := scanner.Text()\n    switch choice {\n    case \"1\":\n        insertCoin()\n    case \"2\":\n        selectProduct()\n    case \"3\":\n        listProducts()\n    case \"4\":\n        cancel()\n    case \"5\":\n        exit()\n        return\n    default:\n        fmt.Println(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI need to implement each of these functions.\n\nFor `insertCoin`, prompt the user to enter the coin value, add it to `insertedCoins`.\n\nValidate that the coin is a valid denomination.\n\nFor `selectProduct`, list the products, ask for the product name, check if it exists, check stock, check if enough money was inserted.\n\nIf yes, dispense the product, decrease stock, calculate change if any.\n\nIf not enough money, show how much more is needed.\n\nIf sold out, show \"Sold out\".\n\nFor `listProducts`, display all products with names and prices.\n\nFor `cancel`, return all inserted coins and reset `insertedCoins` to zero.\n\nFor `exit`, maybe first give the option to cancel if there are inserted coins.\n\nNow, let's think about how to display the change.\n\nMaybe something like:\n\n\"Your change is:\n\n- 1 quarter(s)\n\n- 0 dime(s)\n\n- 1 nickel(s)\n\n- 0 penny(s)\"\n\nWait, but in code, the `calculateChange` function returns a map with denominations as keys and counts as values.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the map and print the number of each coin.\n\nAlso, need to think about how to handle cases where the change is zero, meaning no change is needed.\n\nNow, about handling invalid coin denominations.\n\nDefine valid denominations as 1, 5, 10, 25 cents.\n\nWhen inserting a coin, check if it's one of these denominations.\n\nIf not, display an error message and do not add it to `insertedCoins`.\n\nSimilarly, when selecting a product, check if the product exists in the inventory.\n\nIf not, display \"Invalid product\".\n\nAlso, need to handle case where stock is zero.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the inventory.\n\nUsing a map with product names as keys and `Product` structs as values.\n\nFor example:\n\n```go\nInventory: map[string]Product{\n    \"soda\":  {Name: \"Soda\", Price: 125, Stock: 5},\n    \"chips\": {Name: \"Chips\", Price: 75, Stock: 5},\n    \"candy\": {Name: \"Candy\", Price: 50, Stock: 5},\n    \"water\": {Name: \"Water\", Price: 100, Stock: 5},\n}\n```\n\nIn `listProducts`, iterate through the map and print each product's name and price.\n\nPrice should be displayed in dollars and cents, so convert cents to dollars.\n\nFor example, 125 cents should be displayed as $1.25.\n\nI can write a helper function for that:\n\n```go\nfunc centsToDollars(cents int) string {\n    dollars := cents / 100\n    remainingCents := cents % 100\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"$%d.%02d\", dollars, remainingCents)\n}\n```\n\nThen, in `listProducts`, use this function to display prices.\n\nNow, for `selectProduct`, after dispensing the product and calculating change, I need to reset `insertedCoins` for the next transaction.\n\nOr maybe keep the remaining change in `insertedCoins` so the user can continue using it for the next purchase.\n\nBut in real vending machines, usually after a purchase, the transaction is complete and the machine resets.\n\nSo, I'll reset `insertedCoins` to zero after dispensing the product and returning change.\n\nSimilarly, in `cancel`, reset `insertedCoins` to zero.\n\nNow, for the `exit` option, maybe first check if there are inserted coins, and prompt the user to cancel to get the change back before exiting.\n\nOr perhaps automatically cancel and return the change when exiting.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe just display a message saying that any remaining coins are being returned.\n\nNow, let's think about how to display the menu.\n\nProbably something like:\n\n----\n\nVending Machine\n\n1. Insert coin\n\n2. Select product\n\n3. List products\n\n4. Cancel (return change)\n\n5. Exit\n\n----\n\nThen, based on the user's choice, proceed accordingly.\n\nFor `insertCoin`, prompt:\n\n\"Insert coin (valid denominations: 1, 5, 10, 25 cents):\"\n\nRead the input, validate it, and add to `insertedCoins`.\n\nFor `selectProduct`, first list the products with their names and prices, then ask:\n\n\"Enter the product name:\"\n\nRead the input, check if it exists, check stock, check if enough money was inserted.\n\nIf yes, dispense the product, decrease stock, calculate change if any.\n\nDisplay:\n\n\"Dispensing <product name>\"\n\n\"If change is due: <change description>\"\n\nThen reset `insertedCoins`.\n\nIf not enough money, display:\n\n\"Insufficient funds. Please insert additional <required amount> cents.\"\n\nIf sold out, display \"Sold out\".\n\nFor `listProducts`, display:\n\n\"Available products:\"\n\n\"- <name>: <price>\"\n\nFor each product.\n\nFor `cancel`, display:\n\n\"Returning <insertedCoins> cents.\"\n\nSet `insertedCoins` to zero.\n\nFor `exit`, display:\n\n\"Exiting. Any remaining coins (<insertedCoins> cents) are being returned.\"\n\nSet `insertedCoins` to zero and exit the program.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing this step by step.\n\nFirst, define the `Product` and `VendingMachine` structs.\n\nThen, initialize the vending machine with some products.\n\nThen, implement the main loop with the menu.\n\nImplement each of the menu options as functions.\n\nImplement the `calculateChange` helper function.\n\nImplement the `centsToDollars` helper function.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that the program handles cases where the user tries to insert non-numeric values or invalid choices.\n\nUse error handling to manage invalid inputs.\n\nFor example, when inserting coins, make sure the input is a number and a valid denomination.\n\nSimilarly, when selecting a product, handle cases where the product name is not found.\n\nNow, let's start writing some code.\n\nFirst, define the structs:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"bufio\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\ntype Product struct {\n    Name  string\n    Price int\n    Stock int\n}\n\ntype VendingMachine struct {\n    Inventory       map[string]Product\n    insertedCoins   int\n}\n```\n\nThen, define the valid coin denominations:\n\n```go\nvar validDenominations = map[int]bool{1: true, 5: true, 10: true, 25: true}\n```\n\nInitialize the vending machine:\n\n```go\nfunc NewVendingMachine() *VendingMachine {\n    inventory := map[string]Product{\n        \"soda\":  {Name: \"Soda\", Price: 125, Stock: 5},\n        \"chips\": {Name: \"Chips\", Price: 75, Stock: 5},\n        \"candy\": {Name: \"Candy\", Price: 50, Stock: 5},\n        \"water\": {Name: \"Water\", Price: 100, Stock: 5},\n    }\n    return &VendingMachine{\n        Inventory:    inventory,\n        insertedCoins: 0,\n    }\n}\n```\n\nImplement the `centsToDollars` helper function:\n\n```go\nfunc centsToDollars(cents int) string {\n    dollars := cents / 100\n    remainingCents := cents % 100\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"$%d.%02d\", dollars, remainingCents)\n}\n```\n\nImplement the `calculateChange` helper function:\n\n```go\nfunc calculateChange(change int) map[int]int {\n    denominations := []int{25, 10, 5, 1}\n    coins := make(map[int]int)\n    for _, denom := range denominations {\n        coins[denom] = change / denom\n        change %= denom\n    }\n    return coins\n}\n\nfunc displayChange(coins map[int]int) {\n    fmt.Println(\"Your change is:\")\n    for denom, count := range coins {\n        plural := \"\"\n        if count > 1 {\n            plural = \"s\"\n        }\n        fmt.Printf(\"- %d %d-cent coin%s\\n\", count, denom, plural)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nImplement the `displayMenu` function:\n\n```go\nfunc displayMenu() {\n    fmt.Println(\"\\nVending Machine\")\n    fmt.Println(\"1. Insert coin\")\n    fmt.Println(\"2. Select product\")\n    fmt.Println(\"3. List products\")\n    fmt.Println(\"4. Cancel (return change)\")\n    fmt.Println(\"5. Exit\")\n}\n```\n\nImplement the `insertCoin` function:\n\n```go\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) insertCoin(scanner *bufio.Scanner) {\n    for {\n        fmt.Print(\"Insert coin (valid denominations: 1, 5, 10, 25 cents): \")\n        scanner.Scan()\n        input := scanner.Text()\n        coin, err := strconv.Atoi(input)\n        if err != nil {\n            fmt.Println(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n            continue\n        }\n        if !validDenominations[coin] {\n            fmt.Println(\"Invalid coin denomination. Please insert 1, 5, 10, or 25 cents.\")\n            continue\n        }\n        vm.insertedCoins += coin\n        fmt.Printf(\"Inserted: %d cents. Total inserted: %d cents.\\n\", coin, vm.insertedCoins)\n        break\n    }\n}\n```\n\nImplement the `listProducts` function:\n\n```go\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) listProducts() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Available products:\")\n    for _, product := range vm.Inventory {\n        fmt.Printf(\"- %s: %s\\n\", product.Name, centsToDollars(product.Price))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nImplement the `selectProduct` function:\n\n```go\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) selectProduct(scanner *bufio.Scanner) {\n    vm.listProducts()\n    fmt.Print(\"Enter the product name: \")\n    scanner.Scan()\n    productName := scanner.Text()\n    product, exists := vm.Inventory[productName]\n    if !exists {\n        fmt.Println(\"Invalid product.\")\n        return\n    }\n    if product.Stock == 0 {\n        fmt.Println(\"Sold out.\")\n        return\n    }\n    if vm.insertedCoins < product.Price {\n        required := product.Price - vm.insertedCoins\n        fmt.Printf(\"Insufficient funds. Please insert additional %d cents.\\n\", required)\n        return\n    }\n    // Dispense product\n    fmt.Printf(\"Dispensing %s.\\n\", product.Name)\n    product.Stock--\n    // Calculate change\n    change := vm.insertedCoins - product.Price\n    if change > 0 {\n        coins := calculateChange(change)\n        displayChange(coins)\n    }\n    // Reset insertedCoins\n    vm.insertedCoins = 0\n}\n```\n\nImplement the `cancel` function:\n\n```go\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) cancel() {\n    if vm.insertedCoins > 0 {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Returning %d cents.\\n\", vm.insertedCoins)\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"No coins to return.\")\n    }\n    vm.insertedCoins = 0\n}\n```\n\nImplement the `exit` function:\n\n```go\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) exit() {\n    if vm.insertedCoins > 0 {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Returning %d cents.\\n\", vm.insertedCoins)\n        vm.insertedCoins = 0\n    }\n    fmt.Println(\"Exiting. Thank you for using the vending machine.\")\n}\n```\n\nFinally, implement the main function with the loop:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    vm := NewVendingMachine()\n    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)\n    for {\n        displayMenu()\n        fmt.Print(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        scanner.Scan()\n        choice := scanner.Text()\n        switch choice {\n        case \"1\":\n            vm.insertCoin(scanner)\n        case \"2\":\n            vm.selectProduct(scanner)\n        case \"3\":\n            vm.listProducts()\n        case \"4\":\n            vm.cancel()\n        case \"5\":\n            vm.exit()\n            return\n        default:\n            fmt.Println(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should cover the basic functionality of the vending machine simulation.\n\nI might need to test it to make sure everything works as expected, and handle any edge cases.\n\nFor example, what if the user tries to insert a negative number?\n\nOr what if the user selects a product but doesn't insert any coins?\n\nOr what if the user cancels after selecting a product?\n\nI need to make sure that the state is properly managed in all scenarios.\n\nAlso, perhaps add a way to refill the stock, but that might be beyond the scope for now.\n\nI think this is a good starting point.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a GoLang program that simulates a vending machine, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Structures**:\n   - Define a `Product` struct to hold the name, price, and stock of each product.\n   - Define a `VendingMachine` struct to hold the inventory and the current inserted coins.\n\n2. **Initialize the Vending Machine**:\n   - Create a new vending machine with an initial inventory of products and their stock levels.\n\n3. **Implement Helper Functions**:\n   - `centsToDollars`: Convert cents to a dollar format string.\n   - `calculateChange`: Calculate the change to be returned using the greedy algorithm.\n\n4. **Implement Vending Machine Methods**:\n   - `insertCoin`: Allow the user to insert coins into the machine.\n   - `listProducts`: Display the available products with their names and prices.\n   - `selectProduct`: Allow the user to select a product and handle transactions.\n   - `cancel`: Return the inserted coins and reset the machine.\n   - `exit`: Handle the exit process, returning any remaining coins.\n\n5. **Main Loop**:\n   - Display a menu to the user and handle their choices in a loop until they choose to exit.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"bufio\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"strconv\"\n)\n\ntype Product struct {\n    Name  string\n    Price int // in cents\n    Stock int\n}\n\ntype VendingMachine struct {\n    Inventory       map[string]Product\n    insertedCoins   int\n}\n\nvar validDenominations = map[int]bool{1: true, 5: true, 10: true, 25: true}\n\nfunc NewVendingMachine() *VendingMachine {\n    inventory := map[string]Product{\n        \"soda\":  {Name: \"Soda\", Price: 125, Stock: 5},\n        \"chips\": {Name: \"Chips\", Price: 75, Stock: 5},\n        \"candy\": {Name: \"Candy\", Price: 50, Stock: 5},\n        \"water\": {Name: \"Water\", Price: 100, Stock: 5},\n    }\n    return &VendingMachine{\n        Inventory:    inventory,\n        insertedCoins: 0,\n    }\n}\n\nfunc centsToDollars(cents int) string {\n    dollars := cents / 100\n    remainingCents := cents % 100\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"$%d.%02d\", dollars, remainingCents)\n}\n\nfunc calculateChange(change int) map[int]int {\n    denominations := []int{25, 10, 5, 1}\n    coins := make(map[int]int)\n    for _, denom := range denominations {\n        coins[denom] = change / denom\n        change %= denom\n    }\n    return coins\n}\n\nfunc displayChange(coins map[int]int) {\n    fmt.Println(\"Your change is:\")\n    for denom, count := range coins {\n        plural := \"\"\n        if count > 1 {\n            plural = \"s\"\n        }\n        fmt.Printf(\"- %d %d-cent coin%s\\n\", count, denom, plural)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc displayMenu() {\n    fmt.Println(\"\\nVending Machine\")\n    fmt.Println(\"1.
