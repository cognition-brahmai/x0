        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 4x - 7 = 5. Alright, let's see how to tackle this step by step. The goal here is to find out what value x is, right? So, I need to isolate x on one side of the equation.\n\nFirst, I look at what's being done to x. It looks like x is being multiplied by 4 and then 7 is being subtracted. So, to get x by itself, I need to undo these operations.\n\nI think I should start by dealing with the subtraction. So, I have -7 on the left side. To cancel that out, I can add 7 to both sides of the equation. That way, the -7 and +7 will cancel each other out on the left.\n\nSo, if I add 7 to both sides:\n\n4x - 7 + 7 = 5 + 7\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n4x = 12\n\nOkay, now I have 4x = 12. Now, I need to get x by itself by undoing the multiplication by 4. To do that, I can divide both sides by 4.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 4:\n\n4x / 4 = 12 / 4\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx = 3\n\nAlright, so x equals 3. Let me just double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nI'll plug x = 3 back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nOriginal equation: 4x - 7 = 5\n\nPlugging in x = 3: 4*(3) - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5\n\nYes, that matches the right side of the equation. So, x = 3 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
