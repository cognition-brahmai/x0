        "content": "So, the train is going at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and it takes 4 hours to get to where it's going. I need to find out how far away the destination is.\n\nI remember that when we talk about speed, time, and distance, there's a formula that connects them. It's something like distance equals speed multiplied by time, or maybe it's different. Let me think.\n\nWait, I think it's distance equals speed times time. So, if speed is 60 miles per hour and time is 4 hours, then distance should be 60 times 4, which is 240 miles.\n\nBut, I should make sure that I'm using the right formula. Maybe I should recall the basic relationships between these variables.\n\nSpeed is usually defined as distance divided by time. So, speed equals distance over time. If I rearrange that formula to solve for distance, then yes, distance equals speed times time.\n\nSo, in this case, speed is 60 miles per hour and time is 4 hours. Plugging those values into the formula, distance equals 60 times 4, which is indeed 240 miles.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. Is the train's speed constant throughout the journey, or does it speed up and slow down?\n\nThe problem says it's an average speed of 60 miles per hour, so even if the train changes speed at different points, the average over the entire journey is 60 mph.\n\nSo, using the average speed in the formula should give me the correct distance.\n\nLet me double-check the units to make sure they're consistent. Speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, so when I multiply them, the units should be miles, which is what I'm trying to find.\n\nEverything seems to be in order. So, the destination is 240 miles away.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe I can approach the problem differently to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that in one hour, the train covers 60 miles. So, in 4 hours, it should cover 4 times 60 miles, which is again 240 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for time, which is time equals distance divided by speed, and plug in the values, I can see if it matches the given time.\n\nSo, if distance is 240 miles and speed is 60 mph, time equals 240 divided by 60, which is 4 hours. That matches the given time, so my calculation checks out.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The destination is 240 miles away.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
