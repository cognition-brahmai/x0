        "content": "So I have this problem here: I've got a bag of 90 marbles. 40% of them are red, and the rest are blue. I need to figure out how many blue marbles there are. And I have to show my reasoning. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a total of 90 marbles, and 40% of them are red. That means the remaining percentage must be blue. So, I should probably find out what percentage is blue and then calculate how many that corresponds to in numbers.\n\nLet me start by finding out how many red marbles there are. Since 40% of the marbles are red, I can calculate that by taking 40% of 90. To find a percentage of a number, I use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{percentage} \\times \\text{total number} = \\text{part} \\]\n\nSo, for red marbles:\n\n\\[ 40\\% \\times 90 = \\text{number of red marbles} \\]\n\nBut I need to remember that 40% is the same as 0.40 in decimal form. So, I can rewrite that as:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 90 = \\text{number of red marbles} \\]\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 90 = 36 \\]\n\nSo, there are 36 red marbles.\n\nNow, since the rest of the marbles are blue, I can find the number of blue marbles by subtracting the number of red marbles from the total number of marbles:\n\n\\[ \\text{total marbles} - \\text{red marbles} = \\text{blue marbles} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ 90 - 36 = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 54 blue marbles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by finding the percentage of blue marbles directly?\n\nYes, that's a good point. Since 40% of the marbles are red, the remaining percentage must be blue. So,:\n\n\\[ 100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\% \\]\n\nSo, 60% of the marbles are blue. Now, I can find 60% of 90 to get the number of blue marbles.\n\nAgain, 60% is 0.60 in decimal form, so:\n\n\\[ 0.60 \\times 90 = \\text{number of blue marbles} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ 0.60 \\times 90 = 54 \\]\n\nSo, again, I get 54 blue marbles.\n\nIt's good that both methods give me the same answer. That increases my confidence that I'm correct.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst method:\n\n40% of 90:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 90 = 36 \\] (red marbles)\n\nTotal marbles minus red marbles:\n\n\\[ 90 - 36 = 54 \\] (blue marbles)\n\nSecond method:\n\n60% of 90:\n\n\\[ 0.60 \\times 90 = 54 \\] (blue marbles)\n\nBoth methods confirm that there are 54 blue marbles.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The problem seems straightforward, and I've arrived at the answer through two different approaches, which is always a good way to verify your results.\n\nJust to make sure I haven't missed anything, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the number of blue marbles. For example, are there any marbles that are neither red nor blue? The problem states that the rest are blue, so no, all marbles are either red or blue.\n\nAlso, the total number of marbles is 90, and we've accounted for all of them with 36 red and 54 blue marbles.\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident with the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
