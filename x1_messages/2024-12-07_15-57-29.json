Okay, so the thing that always runs but never walks, often murmurs but never talks, has a bed but never sleeps, and has a mouth but never eats. Hmm.\n\nFirst, \"always runs but never walks.\" That suggests something that is constantly in motion but doesn't have legs or something like that. Like maybe water in a river or something.\n\nThen, \"often murmurs but never talks.\" That could be related to the sound of running water, like a stream or a river making soft noises.\n\nNext, \"has a bed but never sleeps.\" A bed for water could be its channel or basin, where it rests, but it doesn't sleep because it's always moving.\n\nLastly, \"has a mouth but never eats.\" The mouth could be where the river or stream begins, the source, but it doesn't eat because it's not consuming anything in the way living things do.\n\nPutting it all together, it sounds like the answer is a river or a stream. What do you think?"
