Each plan step should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a mix of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. This tool is useful in finding a suitable list of sites that may or may not contain the answer to the user's question. The function doesn't directly answer the question; it finds a list of sites that may have the answer.\nSiteReader[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkSelector[input]: Selects the most relevant links from a plain text list of links and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of selected links.\nSmartQA[input]: Question answering language model, especially useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function just just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., SmartQA[What is the capital of Japan, given :evidence3:?]\n\nMake sure to only include one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who discovered penicillin and what diseases does it treat?"
