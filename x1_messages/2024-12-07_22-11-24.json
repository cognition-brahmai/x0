        "content": "The strait you're referring to is called the Bering Strait, and it separates Big Diomede Island, which belongs to Russia, from Little Diomede Island, which belongs to the United States in Alaska. The Bering Strait is named after the Danish explorer Vitus Bering.\n\nVitus Bering was an explorer who worked for the Russian Empire in the 18th century. He is best known for his two major expeditions: the First Kamchatka Expedition (also known as the First Circumnavigation) and the Second Kamchatka Expedition (also known as the Great Northern Expedition). During these expeditions, Bering and his crew explored the north Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea, mapping coastlines and discovering new lands.\n\nThe Bering Strait is a narrow passage of water that connects the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean and separates the continents of Asia and North America. It's named after Vitus Bering because he was the first European explorer to sail through it during his First Kamchatka Expedition in 1728.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the explorer after whom the strait is named is Vitus Bering."
