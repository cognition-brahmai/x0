        "content": "So I've got this math problem here: ((4^2 - 3) / 7) * 14 + 8. Hmm, let's see how to tackle this step by step. I remember that when solving expressions, it's important to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, I need to handle what's inside the parentheses: (4^2 - 3). So, I should calculate the exponent before the subtraction. 4 squared is 16, so that gives me (16 - 3), which is 13. Now the expression simplifies to (13 / 7) * 14 + 8.\n\nNext, I have to deal with the division and multiplication from left to right. So, 13 divided by 7 is approximately 1.857. But maybe it's better to keep it as a fraction for accuracy. 13 divided by 7 is 13/7. Multiplying that by 14 gives me (13/7) * 14. Well, 14 is the same as 14/1, so multiplying fractions: 13 * 14 over 7 * 1, which is 182/7. Simplifying that, 182 divided by 7 is 26. So now the expression is 26 + 8.\n\nFinally, adding 26 and 8 gives me 34. So, the final answer should be 34.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this. Let's try evaluating it again.\n\nStarting with ((4^2 - 3) / 7) * 14 + 8.\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent: 4^2 is 16.\n\nThen, subtract 3 from 16: 16 - 3 = 13.\n\nNow, divide 13 by 7: 13 / 7 = approximately 1.857, but as I thought before, it's better to keep it as 13/7.\n\nNext, multiply by 14: 13/7 * 14. Since 14 is divisible by 7, 14/7 is 2, so 13 * 2 = 26.\n\nFinally, add 8: 26 + 8 = 34.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent. Maybe I can try plugging it into a calculator to verify, but since I don't have one right now, I'll trust my calculations.\n\nSo, the answer is 34.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{34} \\]"
