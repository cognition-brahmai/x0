        "content": "Let's see. I know that Andrew Jackson was a general during the War of 1812, and he later became president. I'm trying to think of another president who was also a general in that war. Hmm, was William Henry Harrison a general in the War of 1812? I think he was, and he also became president later on. Let me check that.\n\nOkay, I recall that William Henry Harrison was involved in the War of 1812 and he had some military successes. Then, later in his political career, he ran for president and won the election of 1840, right? So, he would be another president who was a general during the War of 1812.\n\nBut wait, was there another one? Let me think. Maybe Zachary Taylor? I think Zachary Taylor was also a general, but was he involved in the War of 1812? Or was it a different war? I need to make sure about that.\n\nZachary Taylor was a general, and he became president in 1849, after the Mexican-American War. So, that would be a different war. So, he wouldn't count for the War of 1812.\n\nWhat about James Madison? He was president during the War of 1812, but was he a general? I don't think so. He was more of a politician and the father of the Constitution.\n\nHow about James Monroe? He was involved in the American Revolution, I believe, and later became president. But in the War of 1812, I think he had a role, but was he a general? Maybe not.\n\nWait, Andrew Jackson was a major general in the Tennessee militia during the War of 1812, and he had his famous victory at the Battle of New Orleans. William Henry Harrison was a major general and had successes in the Old Northwest, like the Battle of Thames.\n\nIs there anyone else? Let me see. Maybe Edmund Pendleton Gaines? He was a general in the War of 1812, but I don't think he became president. So, that wouldn't fit.\n\nSo, based on what I'm recalling, William Henry Harrison would be the other president who was a general during the War of 1812.\n\nBut, to be thorough, maybe I should consider some other figures. Like, was Andrew Jackson the only Democratic-Republican president who was a general in that war? Or was there another one?\n\nWait, Andrew Jackson was from the Democratic Party, I think, and William Henry Harrison was from the Whig Party. But in terms of the War of 1812, I believe Harrison was the other president who was a general in that war.\n\nLet me try to confirm this. Andrew Jackson: War of 1812, Battle of New Orleans, later president in 1828. William Henry Harrison: War of 1812, Battle of Thames, president in 1840.\n\nIs there any other president who served as a general in the War of 1812? I can't think of anyone else off the top of my head.\n\nSo, I think the answer is William Henry Harrison.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{William Henry Harrison}} \\]"
