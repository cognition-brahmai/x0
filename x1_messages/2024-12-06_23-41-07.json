        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a coffee shop that sells small and large cups of coffee, and the ratio of small to large cups sold is 3:2. They sold a total of 250 cups. We need to find out how many of each size were sold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 3:2 for small to large cups means that for every 3 small cups sold, there are 2 large cups sold. So, the sales are divided into parts where 3 parts are small and 2 parts are large.\n\nNext, I should figure out how many total parts there are. If there are 3 parts small and 2 parts large, then the total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, since the total number of cups sold is 250, and these are divided into 5 parts, I can find out how many cups are in each part by dividing 250 by 5. So, 250 \u00f7 5 = 50 cups per part.\n\nNow, to find the number of small cups sold, I multiply the number of parts for small cups by the number of cups per part. Since small cups have 3 parts, it's 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 small cups.\n\nSimilarly, for large cups, which have 2 parts, it's 2 \u00d7 50 = 100 large cups.\n\nTo check if this makes sense, I can add the number of small and large cups together: 150 + 100 = 250, which matches the total number of cups sold. Also, the ratio of 150:100 simplifies to 3:2, which matches the given ratio.\n\nSo, the coffee shop sold 150 small cups and 100 large cups.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150 \\text{ small cups and } 100 \\text{ large cups}} \\]"
