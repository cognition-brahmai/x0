        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a father and his son, and we're trying to figure out their current ages based on the information given.\n\nFirst, it says that the father is four times as old as his son right now. Let's use some variables to represent their ages. I'll let S represent the son's current age. Then, the father's current age would be 4 times that, so 4S.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem says that in 10 years, the father will be twice as old as his son. So, in 10 years, the son's age will be S + 10, and the father's age will be 4S + 10.\n\nAccording to the problem, at that time, the father will be twice as old as the son. So, we can set up an equation: 4S + 10 = 2(S + 10).\n\nNow, let's solve for S.\n\nFirst, expand the right side: 4S + 10 = 2S + 20.\n\nNext, subtract 2S from both sides: 2S + 10 = 20.\n\nThen, subtract 10 from both sides: 2S = 10.\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2: S = 5.\n\nSo, the son is currently 5 years old. Since the father is four times as old, that means the father is 4 times 5, which is 20 years old.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's check if this makes sense. In 10 years, the son will be 5 + 10 = 15 years old, and the father will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old. Is the father twice as old as the son at that time? Well, twice 15 is 30, so yes, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we let F be the father's current age and S be the son's current age.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) F = 4S (father is four times as old as son now)\n\n2) F + 10 = 2(S + 10) (in 10 years, father is twice as old as son)\n\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second:\n\n4S + 10 = 2(S + 10)\n\nThen, solve for S:\n\n4S + 10 = 2S + 20\n\nSubtract 2S from both sides:\n\n2S + 10 = 20\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n2S = 10\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nS = 5\n\nThen, F = 4 * 5 = 20\n\nSo, the father is currently 20 years old.\n\nWait, but that seems young for a father. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's consider the age difference between the father and the son.\n\nThe age difference is F - S, and this difference remains constant over time.\n\nFrom the first equation, F = 4S.\n\nIn 10 years, the father will be F + 10 and the son will be S + 10, and the father will be twice as old as the son at that time.\n\nSo, F + 10 = 2(S + 10)\n\nBut since F = 4S, substitute:\n\n4S + 10 = 2(S + 10)\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nSolving it gives S = 5, F = 20.\n\nHmm, maybe it's possible for a 20-year-old to be a father, but it seems young. Maybe the problem is expecting different units or something, but probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the father can't be 20 if his son is 5, because that would mean the father was 15 when the son was born, which is biologically possible but perhaps not typical.\n\nBut according to the problem, that's the solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo or is misstated.\n\nWait, let me check the equations again.\n\nWe have:\n\n1) F = 4S\n\n2) F + 10 = 2(S + 10)\n\nSubstituting 1 into 2:\n\n4S + 10 = 2S + 20\n\nSubtract 2S from both sides:\n\n2S + 10 = 20\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n2S = 10\n\nS = 5\n\nF = 20\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that the father is four times as old as the son now, and in 10 years, he will be twice as old as the son is now, not twice as old as the son will be in 10 years.\n\nWait, let's read the problem again: \"In 10 years, he will be twice as old as his son.\"\n\nThis clearly means twice as old as his son will be in 10 years.\n\nSo, the solution seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the father is currently 20 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
