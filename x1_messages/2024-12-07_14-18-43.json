        "content": "Let's see. The factory currently produces 200 units per day. They need to increase production by 50%. So, first I need to calculate what 50% of 200 units is.\n\n50% of 200 is calculated as 0.5 times 200, which is 100 units. So, the increase is 100 units per day.\n\nNow, the factory needs to produce an extra 1,000 units. To find out how many additional days it will take, I need to divide the extra units needed by the daily production increase.\n\nSo, 1,000 units divided by 100 units per day equals 10 days.\n\nTherefore, it will take an additional 10 days to produce the extra 1,000 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
