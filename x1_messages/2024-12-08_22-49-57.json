        "content": "So I've got this problem here about ratios of different colored balls in a box. It says that the ratio of red to blue balls is 3:2, and the ratio of blue to green balls is 4:5. I need to find out the ratio of red to green balls. Hmm, ratios can be a bit tricky, but let's see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what ratios represent. A ratio like 3:2 for red to blue means that for every 3 red balls, there are 2 blue balls. Similarly, 4:5 for blue to green means that for every 4 blue balls, there are 5 green balls. But I need to find the ratio of red to green balls directly. How can I link these two ratios together?\n\nI think the key here is to find a common term between the two ratios so that I can relate red and green through blue. Both ratios involve blue balls, so maybe I can find a way to express both red and green in terms of blue.\n\nLet me denote the number of red balls as R, blue balls as B, and green balls as G.\n\nFrom the first ratio, red to blue is 3:2, which can be written as:\n\nR / B = 3 / 2\n\nSimilarly, the second ratio, blue to green is 4:5, which is:\n\nB / G = 4 / 5\n\nI need to find R / G.\n\nHmm, if I have R in terms of B and B in terms of G, maybe I can substitute to find R in terms of G.\n\nFrom the first equation, R = (3/2) B\n\nFrom the second equation, B = (4/5) G\n\nSo, plugging the expression for B into the first equation:\n\nR = (3/2) * (4/5) G\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(3/2) * (4/5) = (3 * 4) / (2 * 5) = 12 / 10 = 6 / 5\n\nSo, R = (6/5) G\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red to green balls is 6:5.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with R / B = 3 / 2 and B / G = 4 / 5.\n\nI multiplied (3/2) by (4/5) to get (12/10), which simplifies to (6/5). So, R / G = 6 / 5, meaning R:G = 6:5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of actual numbers to verify.\n\nSuppose there are 4 blue balls (since blue is common in both ratios, and 4 is a multiple used in the blue to green ratio).\n\nGiven B = 4,\n\nFrom B / G = 4 / 5, so G = (5/4) * B = (5/4)*4 = 5 green balls.\n\nFrom R / B = 3 / 2, so R = (3/2)*B = (3/2)*4 = 6 red balls.\n\nSo, R:G = 6:5.\n\nThat seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose different numbers, say B = 8,\n\nThen G = (5/4)*8 = 10,\n\nAnd R = (3/2)*8 = 12,\n\nSo R:G = 12:10, which simplifies to 6:5.\n\nSame ratio.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red to green balls is indeed 6:5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6:5} \\]"
