        "content": "So, there's this group of people who put in a total of $100,000 into a project. After a year, their investment grows by 8%. Now, they want to split the profits equally among five people. The question is, how much does each person get?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the total amount is after the 8% growth. If they started with $100,000 and it grew by 8%, I can calculate the new total by adding the growth to the original amount.\n\nSo, 8% of $100,000 is $8,000, right? Because 10% of $100,000 is $10,000, so 8% would be $8,000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount after one year is $100,000 plus $8,000, which equals $108,000.\n\nNow, they want to split the profits equally among five people. But wait, is the profit the total amount or just the growth?\n\nI think profit refers to the growth, which is $8,000. So, if they split the profit equally among five people, each person would get $8,000 divided by 5.\n\n$8,000 \u00f7 5 = $1,600.\n\nSo, each person gets $1,600.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe they meant to split the total amount, not just the profit.\n\nIf they split the total amount of $108,000 among five people, each would get $108,000 \u00f7 5 = $21,600.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because they invested $100,000 together, and if they split the total, they'd each get back their share of the original investment plus their share of the profit.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. If there are five people sharing the investment, maybe each person initially invested $20,000, since $100,000 divided by 5 is $20,000.\n\nThen, the total profit is $8,000, and if they split the profit equally, each gets $1,600.\n\nSo, each person gets their original investment back plus their share of the profit.\n\nThat would be $20,000 back plus $1,600 profit, totaling $21,600 per person.\n\nBut earlier, I thought if they split the total amount, it would also be $21,600 per person.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me start over.\n\nTotal investment: $100,000.\n\nGrowth: 8%, which is $8,000.\n\nTotal amount after one year: $108,000.\n\nNumber of people: 5.\n\nIf they split the profits equally, meaning the $8,000 is divided by 5, which is $1,600 per person.\n\nBut, each person also gets back their original investment.\n\nAssuming they invested equally, each person invested $20,000.\n\nSo, each person gets back $20,000 plus $1,600, totaling $21,600.\n\nAlternatively, if they split the total amount equally, it's $108,000 divided by 5, which is also $21,600 per person.\n\nSo, either way, it seems each person gets $21,600.\n\nBut the question says \"split the profits equally among five people,\" which suggests that only the $8,000 profit is being split, not the entire $108,000.\n\nIn that case, each person gets $1,600.\n\nHowever, perhaps the context implies that they are splitting the entire amount, including the original investment.\n\nThis is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Only the profit is split equally.\n\nTotal profit: $8,000.\n\nNumber of people: 5.\n\nEach person's share of profit: $1,600.\n\nEach person also gets back their original investment: $20,000.\n\nTotal per person: $20,000 + $1,600 = $21,600.\n\nSecond interpretation: The entire amount after growth is split equally.\n\nTotal amount: $108,000.\n\nNumber of people: 5.\n\nEach person's share: $108,000 \u00f7 5 = $21,600.\n\nBoth interpretations lead to the same amount per person: $21,600.\n\nTherefore, each person receives $21,600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21600} \\]"
