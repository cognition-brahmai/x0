        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It divides the input list into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them back together. This process is repeated recursively until the entire list is sorted.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:\n\n1. **Divide**: Split the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).\n\n2. **Conquer**: Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python. We'll write a function called `merge_sort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list.\n\nFirst, we need to handle the base case for the recursion. If the list has one or zero elements, it's already sorted, so we can return it as is.\n\nNext, we'll find the midpoint of the list and split it into two halves. We'll recursively call `merge_sort` on both halves.\n\nFinally, we'll merge the two sorted halves back together. To do this, we'll create a helper function called `merge` that takes two sorted lists and combines them into a single sorted list.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n\n    # Find the midpoint\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n\n    # Split the list into two halves\n    left_half = arr[:mid]\n    right_half = arr[mid:]\n\n    # Recursively sort both halves\n    left_sorted = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right_sorted = merge_sort(right_half)\n\n    # Merge the sorted halves\n    return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    merged = []\n    left_index = 0\n    right_index = 0\n\n    # Merge the two lists together until one is empty\n    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):\n        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:\n            merged.append(left[left_index])\n            left_index += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[right_index])\n            right_index += 1\n\n    # If there are remaining elements in left or right, add them to the merged list\n    merged.extend(left[left_index:])\n    merged.extend(right[right_index:])\n\n    return merged\n\n# Take input from the user\ninput_str = input(\"Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: \")\ninput_list = [int(num) for num in input_str.split()]\n\n# Sort the list using merge sort\nsorted_list = merge_sort(input_list)\n\n# Display the sorted list\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **merge_sort function**:\n   - Base case: If the list has one or zero elements, return it.\n   - Split the list into two halves.\n   - Recursively sort both halves.\n   - Merge the sorted halves using the `merge` function.\n\n2. **merge function**:\n   - Initialize an empty list to store the merged result.\n   - Use indices to track positions in the left and right lists.\n   - Compare elements from both lists and append the smaller one to the merged list.\n   - Add any remaining elements from either list to the merged list.\n\n3. **User Input and Output**:\n   - Prompt the user to enter a list of integers separated by spaces.\n   - Convert the input string into a list of integers.\n   - Call `merge_sort` on the input list and print the sorted result.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the list is sorted efficiently using the merge sort algorithm."
