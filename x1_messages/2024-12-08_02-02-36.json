        "content": "So, the question is about calculating the total water consumption for a person who drinks 8 glasses of water each day, with each glass being 250 milliliters, over a period of 30 days. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much water the person drinks in one day. Since they drink 8 glasses per day and each glass is 250 mL, we can multiply the number of glasses by the volume per glass:\n\n\\[ \\text{Daily consumption} = 8 \\, \\text{glasses/day} \\times 250 \\, \\text{mL/glass} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Daily consumption} = 2000 \\, \\text{mL/day} \\]\n\nSo, the person drinks 2000 milliliters of water every day.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total consumption over 30 days. To do this, we'll multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in the month:\n\n\\[ \\text{Monthly consumption} = 2000 \\, \\text{mL/day} \\times 30 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Monthly consumption} = 60,000 \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\nNow, 60,000 milliliters might be a bit difficult to visualize, so it's often helpful to convert this to liters. Since there are 1000 milliliters in a liter:\n\n\\[ \\text{Monthly consumption in liters} = \\frac{60,000 \\, \\text{mL}}{1000 \\, \\text{mL/liter}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Monthly consumption in liters} = 60 \\, \\text{liters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the person consumes 60 liters of water in a month with 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ liters}} \\]"
