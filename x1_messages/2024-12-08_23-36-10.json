        "content": "Let's see what happened here. So, there are three sons, and each got $1000 from their dad to invest in whatever they wanted. Okay, fair enough.\n\nThe first son invested in stocks and doubled his money. So, he started with $1000 and doubled it, which means he has $2000 now.\n\nThe second son invested in bonds and tripled his money. So, he started with $1000 and tripled it, which means he has $3000 now.\n\nThe third son invested in real estate and quadrupled his money. So, he started with $1000 and quadrupled it, which means he has $4000 now.\n\nAlright, so now they all have their respective amounts: $2000, $3000, and $4000.\n\nNext, they decided to give their father back the initial investment of $1000 each. So, each son gives back $1000 to their father.\n\nLet's see how much each son has left after giving back $1000.\n\nFirst son: had $2000, gives back $1000, so he has $1000 left.\n\nSecond son: had $3000, gives back $1000, so he has $2000 left.\n\nThird son: had $4000, gives back $1000, so he has $3000 left.\n\nNow, the question is, how much money do the sons have left after returning the initial investment to their father?\n\nSo, we just calculated that:\n\n- First son has $1000 left.\n\n- Second son has $2000 left.\n\n- Third son has $3000 left.\n\nTo find the total amount they have left, we can add these amounts together:\n\n$1000 + $2000 + $3000 = $6000.\n\nSo, collectively, the sons have $6000 left after giving back the initial $1000 each to their father.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst son: $1000 initial, doubled to $2000, gives back $1000, left with $1000.\n\nSecond son: $1000 initial, tripled to $3000, gives back $1000, left with $2000.\n\nThird son: $1000 initial, quadrupled to $4000, gives back $1000, left with $3000.\n\nTotal left: $1000 + $2000 + $3000 = $6000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nLet's consider the total initial investment. The father gave each son $1000, so total given out was $1000 x 3 = $3000.\n\nNow, the sons invested and got returns:\n\n- First son: $1000 to $2000 (doubled).\n\n- Second son: $1000 to $3000 (tripled).\n\n- Third son: $1000 to $4000 (quadrupled).\n\nSo, the total value of their investments is $2000 + $3000 + $4000 = $9000.\n\nNow, they give back the initial $1000 each to their father. So, they give back a total of $1000 x 3 = $3000.\n\nTherefore, the amount they have left is the total value of their investments minus the amount they gave back to their father: $9000 - $3000 = $6000.\n\nThis matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each son kept the profit they made from their investments.\n\nLet's calculate the profit for each son:\n\nFirst son: started with $1000, ended with $2000, so profit is $2000 - $1000 = $1000.\n\nSecond son: started with $1000, ended with $3000, so profit is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.\n\nThird son: started with $1000, ended with $4000, so profit is $4000 - $1000 = $3000.\n\nTotal profit: $1000 + $2000 + $3000 = $6000.\n\nThis again confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the sons have $6000 left after giving back the initial investment to their father.\n\nWait, but the question says \"give their father back the initial investment of $1000 each.\" So, they each give back $1000 to their father, which is the initial investment.\n\nBut in the first scenario, the first son doubled his money to $2000 and gives back $1000, which is his initial investment, so he's left with $1000, which is his profit.\n\nSimilarly, the second son tripled his money to $3000 and gives back $1000, left with $2000, which is his profit.\n\nThe third son quadrupled his money to $4000 and gives back $1000, left with $3000, which is his profit.\n\nSo, in total, they have their profits totaling $1000 + $2000 + $3000 = $6000.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about it in terms of the father receiving back his initial investment, he gave out $3000 initially ($1000 to each son), and now he receives back $1000 from each son, totaling $3000, which is exactly what he gave out. So, he breaks even, neither gaining nor losing money.\n\nMeanwhile, the sons keep their profits, which total $6000.\n\nSo, the answer should be that the sons have $6000 left after giving back the initial investment to their father.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose the father gave each son $1000, and they invested and gained returns as stated.\n\nNow, they decide to give back the initial investment of $1000 each.\n\nBut perhaps the way it's worded could be ambiguous.\n\nDoes \"give back the initial investment of $1000 each\" mean:\n\n1. Each son gives back $1000, regardless of their gains, or\n\n2. Each son gives back an amount equal to their initial investment, which for each is $1000, but perhaps considering their gains.\n\nBut in this case, since each son had an initial investment of $1000, giving back $1000 each seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it means giving back the initial investment amount from the total they have now.\n\nBut no, the wording is \"give their father back the initial investment of $1000 each.\"\n\nSo, each son gives back $1000 to their father.\n\nTherefore, each son is giving back the initial $1000 they received, and keeping the rest, which is their profit.\n\nHence, the first son keeps $1000, the second keeps $2000, and the third keeps $3000, totaling $6000.\n\nAlternatively, if the father received back $3000 in total, but the question is about how much the sons have left, not about the father.\n\nSo, the sons have $6000 left after giving back the initial investment.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
