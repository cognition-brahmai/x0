        "content": "Alright, I'm going to guide you through building a simple Node.js application that fetches weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API. We'll make sure it's user-friendly and displays the current temperature, humidity, and weather description for a city you input.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Project\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n1. **Create a new directory** for your project:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir weather-app\n   cd weather-app\n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:\n   ```bash\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Install Required Packages\n\nWe'll need a few npm packages to handle HTTP requests and user input.\n\n1. **Install `axios`** for making HTTP requests:\n   ```bash\n   npm install axios\n   ```\n\n2. **Install `readline-sync`** for reading user input from the command line:\n   ```bash\n   npm install readline-sync\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Get an API Key\n\nTo use OpenWeatherMap's API, you need an API key.\n\n1. **Sign up** on the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) if you don't have an account.\n\n2. **Create an API key** from your account dashboard.\n\n### Step 4: Write the Code\n\nNow, let's create the main JavaScript file for our application.\n\n1. **Create a new file** called `app.js`:\n   ```bash\n   touch app.js\n   ```\n\n2. **Open `app.js`** in your favorite text editor and add the following code:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const axios = require('axios');\n   const readlineSync = require('readline-sync');\n\n   // Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key\n   const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n   const API_URL = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather';\n\n   function getWeather(city) {\n       const url = `${API_URL}?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric`;\n       return axios.get(url);\n   }\n\n   function displayWeather(data) {\n       const { temp, humidity } = data.main;\n       const { description } = data.weather[0];\n       console.log(`Temperature: ${temp}\u00b0C`);\n       console.log(`Humidity: ${humidity}%`);\n       console.log(`Weather Description: ${description}`);\n   }\n\n   function main() {\n       const city = readlineSync.question('Enter the name of the city: ');\n       getWeather(city)\n           .then(response => {\n               displayWeather(response.data);\n           })\n           .catch(error => {\n               console.error('Error fetching weather data:', error.message);\n           });\n   }\n\n   main();\n   ```\n\n### Step 5: Run Your Application\n\n1. **Save your changes** in `app.js`.\n\n2. **Run the application** from your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   node app.js\n   ```\n\n3. **Enter a city name** when prompted, and see the weather information displayed.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Axios**: Used to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n- **Readline-sync**: Allows reading user input from the command line synchronously.\n- **API Key**: Required for authenticating requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n- **API URL**: Constructed with the city name and API key to fetch weather data.\n- **Display Function**: Extracts and prints temperature, humidity, and weather description.\n\nThis should give you a basic weather application in Node.js. You can expand upon this by adding more features, such as handling different units or providing forecasts for multiple days."
