        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a C++ class for a 2D point with x and y coordinates. I need to implement methods for calculating the distance between two points, finding the midpoint between two points, and rotating a point around another point by a given angle in degrees.\n\nFirst, I'll define the class and its member variables. Since it's a 2D point, I'll have two double variables for x and y coordinates.\n\n```cpp\nclass Point2D {\nprivate:\n    double x;\n    double y;\npublic:\n    // Constructors, methods, etc.\n};\n```\n\nI should probably have a constructor that allows me to initialize x and y.\n\n```cpp\nPoint2D(double x_coord, double y_coord) : x(x_coord), y(y_coord) {}\n```\n\nAlso, it might be useful to have getter methods for x and y.\n\n```cpp\ndouble get_x() const { return x; }\ndouble get_y() const { return y; }\n```\n\nNow, for the distance between two points. The distance formula is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). So, I'll implement a method that takes another Point2D object and returns the distance.\n\n```cpp\ndouble distance(const Point2D& other) const {\n    double dx = other.x - x;\n    double dy = other.y - y;\n    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n}\n```\n\nNext, the midpoint between two points. The midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). So, I'll create a method that takes another Point2D object and returns a new Point2D object representing the midpoint.\n\n```cpp\nPoint2D midpoint(const Point2D& other) const {\n    double mx = (x + other.x) / 2;\n    double my = (y + other.y) / 2;\n    return Point2D(mx, my);\n}\n```\n\nFinally, rotating a point around another point by a given angle in degrees. Rotation in 2D involves some trigonometry. I need to translate the point so that the rotation center is at the origin, apply the rotation, and then translate back.\n\nThe rotation formulas are:\n\nx' = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)\n\ny' = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\n\nBut since we're rotating around another point, not the origin, I need to adjust for that.\n\nFirst, translate the point and the rotation center so that the rotation center is at the origin.\n\nThen apply the rotation.\n\nThen translate back.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Translate: subtract rotation center's coordinates from the point's coordinates.\n\n2. Rotate: apply the rotation formulas.\n\n3. Translate back: add the rotation center's coordinates back to the rotated point.\n\nAlso, since the angle is given in degrees, I need to convert it to radians because C++ trigonometric functions use radians.\n\nHere's how I can implement this:\n\n```cpp\nPoint2D rotateAround(const Point2D& center, double angle_degrees) const {\n    // Convert angle from degrees to radians\n    double angle_radians = angle_degrees * (M_PI / 180.0);\n    \n    // Translate point so that rotation center is at origin\n    double translated_x = x - center.x;\n    double translated_y = y - center.y;\n    \n    // Apply rotation\n    double cos_theta = cos(angle_radians);\n    double sin_theta = sin(angle_radians);\n    double rotated_x = translated_x * cos_theta - translated_y * sin_theta;\n    double rotated_y = translated_x * sin_theta + translated_y * cos_theta;\n    \n    // Translate back\n    double new_x = rotated_x + center.x;\n    double new_y = rotated_y + center.y;\n    \n    return Point2D(new_x, new_y);\n}\n```\n\nI should also consider if I want to allow modification of the point in place or if I want these operations to return new Point2D objects. For now, I've chosen to return new objects, making the class immutable.\n\nAdditionally, it might be useful to have a method to print the point's coordinates for debugging purposes.\n\n```cpp\nvoid print() const {\n    cout << \"(\" << x << \", \" << y << \")\" << endl;\n}\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the complete class would look like this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cmath>\n#include <iostream>\n\nclass Point2D {\nprivate:\n    double x;\n    double y;\npublic:\n    Point2D(double x_coord, double y_coord) : x(x_coord), y(y_coord) {}\n    \n    double get_x() const { return x; }\n    double get_y() const { return y; }\n    \n    double distance(const Point2D& other) const {\n        double dx = other.x - x;\n        double dy = other.y - y;\n        return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n    }\n    \n    Point2D midpoint(const Point2D& other) const {\n        double mx = (x + other.x) / 2;\n        double my = (y + other.y) / 2;\n        return Point2D(mx, my);\n    }\n    \n    Point2D rotateAround(const Point2D& center, double angle_degrees) const {\n        double angle_radians = angle_degrees * (M_PI / 180.0);\n        double translated_x = x - center.x;\n        double translated_y = y - center.y;\n        double cos_theta = cos(angle_radians);\n        double sin_theta = sin(angle_radians);\n        double rotated_x = translated_x * cos_theta - translated_y * sin_theta;\n        double rotated_y = translated_x * sin_theta + translated_y * cos_theta;\n        double new_x = rotated_x + center.x;\n        double new_y = rotated_y + center.y;\n        return Point2D(new_x, new_y);\n    }\n    \n    void print() const {\n        std::cout << \"(\" << x << \", \" << y << \")\" << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nI should test this class to make sure everything works as expected. For example:\n\n1. Create two points and calculate the distance between them.\n\n2. Find the midpoint between them.\n\n3. Rotate one point around the other by a certain angle and verify the result.\n\nThis should cover the basic requirements. If needed, I can add more methods or functionalities in the future.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a C++ class representing a 2D point with x and y coordinates.
