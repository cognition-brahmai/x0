        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If you fill a swimming pool with water at a rate of 500 gallons per hour, how long will it take to fill a 12,000-gallon pool? Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a pool that holds 12,000 gallons of water, and I'm filling it at a rate of 500 gallons every hour. I need to find out how many hours it will take to fill the pool completely.\n\nWell, this seems like a straightforward division problem. I think I should divide the total volume of the pool by the filling rate to get the time required. So, time equals total volume divided by rate.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTime = Total Volume / Rate\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 12,000 gallons / 500 gallons per hour\n\nNow, doing the division:\n\n12,000 divided by 500 is... let's see, 500 times 24 is 12,000. So, it should be 24 hours.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf I multiply 500 gallons per hour by 24 hours, I get 12,000 gallons, which matches the pool's capacity. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the filling time. For example, is the filling rate constant? Is there any loss due to evaporation or overflow? The problem doesn't mention any complications like that, so I'll assume the rate is constant and there are no losses.\n\nAlso, I should make sure about the units. The rate is given in gallons per hour, and the pool's volume is in gallons, so the units are consistent. The answer will be in hours, which is fine.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using proportions or something like that?\n\nWell, I could think of it as:\n\n500 gallons -> 1 hour\n\n12,000 gallons -> x hours\n\nThen, x = (12,000 gallons) / (500 gallons/hour)\n\nAgain, that gives x = 24 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many 500-gallon portions are there in 12,000 gallons. That would be 12,000 divided by 500, which is again 24. So, 24 hours.\n\nLet me consider if the pool has any initial water in it. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's empty to start with.\n\nAlso, is there a time limit or any constraints mentioned? No, so I can proceed with the calculation as is.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if the numbers are realistic. A swimming pool holding 12,000 gallons sounds reasonable, and a filling rate of 500 gallons per hour is also plausible for a household water supply.\n\nWait a minute, is 500 gallons per hour a typical filling rate for a swimming pool? Actually, that seems a bit slow. I recall that larger pools are often filled using higher flow rates, maybe several thousand gallons per hour. But perhaps for a smaller pool or a slower filling scenario, 500 gallons per hour could be acceptable.\n\nAnyway, the problem specifies this rate, so I'll go with it.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any need to convert units. The question is in gallons and hours, and the answer is in hours, so no conversion is necessary unless specified otherwise.\n\nIs there any chance of the rate changing over time? Again, the problem doesn't indicate any changes, so I'll assume the rate remains constant.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all possible angles here. The calculation seems straightforward, and my answer is 24 hours.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll do a quick mental math check:\n\n500 gallons per hour:\n\nAfter 10 hours: 5,000 gallons\n\nAfter 20 hours: 10,000 gallons\n\nAfter 24 hours: 12,000 gallons\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final answer is 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
