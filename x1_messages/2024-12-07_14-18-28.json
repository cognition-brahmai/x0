Each plan should have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the outcome of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's question, one or more preceding evidence values, or a mix of both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nYahooSearch[input]: A tool that lets the user look up information through the Yahoo search engine. It aids in identifying a suitable list of sites that might hold the answer to the user's question.\nLinkGatherer[input]: Gathers links from plain text and delivers a plain text, newline-separated response of links.\nWebCrawler[input]: Fetches one or more websites from the input string containing newline-separated links, where input is one or more links, and yields plain text comprising the content of the links.\nFAQModel[input]: Frequently Asked Questions model, notably adept at answering questions based on an input text passage. The input has to be a text question that points to an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the population of Tokyo, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be structured as follows:\nPlan: [initial action to undertake based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to invoke with input parameter]\nPlan: [following action to undertake, hinging on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [subsequent function to invoke and input parameter, which might point to earlier evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: holding the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and what other books have they written?"
