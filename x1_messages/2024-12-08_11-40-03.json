        "content": "Hmm, that sounds like a riddle. Let's see... \"I am a fire's best friend.\" So, something that's useful for fires. Maybe it helps to start or feed a fire.\n\n\"when fat, my body fills with wind.\" When it's fat, meaning when it's big or thick, it's full of wind. Wind would be air, right? So maybe it's something that holds air when it's big.\n\n\"when pushed to thin, through my nose I blow.\" When it's made thin, it blows air through its nose. Nose might be a metaphor for an opening or a hole.\n\n\"then you can watch the embers glow.\" So, when it blows air, it makes the embers in the fire glow brighter. That makes sense because blowing air on embers can make them burn more vigorously.\n\nSo, combining all these clues, it seems like the answer is a bellows. A bellows is used to stoke fires by blowing air into them, making the embers glow brighter. When it's not in use, it's expanded and full of air, and when you squeeze it to make it thin, it forces air out through an opening, like a nozzle or a nose.\n\nBut let's think if there are other possibilities. Maybe it's a lung, like an animal's lung, since lungs hold air and can be compressed to expel air. But lungs aren't typically considered a fire's best friend. Maybe not.\n\nOr perhaps it's a fan of some sort, but fans are more modern, and the riddle seems to be talking about something more primitive.\n\nWait, in some cultures, they use their own breath to blow on embers to get a fire going. But the riddle mentions a distinct object, not a body part.\n\nAnother thought: maybe it's a blowpipe used for blowing air into a fire. But blowpipes are usually associated with smoking, not necessarily with fires.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the riddle again. \"I am a fire's best friend.\" Definitely something associated with fires.\n\n\"when fat, my body fills with wind.\" So, when it's expanded or full, it's filled with air.\n\n\"when pushed to thin, through my nose I blow.\" When compressed or made thin, it expels air through an opening.\n\n\"then you can watch the embers glow.\" The action of blowing air makes the embers glow.\n\nThis really does point to a bellows. Bellows are designed to hold air when expanded and force it out when compressed, specifically for stoking fires.\n\nI think the answer is a bellows.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{bellows}} \\]"
