        "content": "\"American Gothic\" is a iconic painting by Grant Wood, first exhibited in 1930. The painting depicts a farmer standing beside his daughter in front of their Gothic-style house. The farmer is holding a pitchfork, which has become an integral part of the painting's imagery. The pitchfork symbolizes hard work and agricultural life, reflecting the rural American values of the time."
