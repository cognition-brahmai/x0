Each step should have an associated evidence value, which will be the output of one of the functions given an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nWebSearch[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information on the web. This tool is useful in finding sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkPicker[input]: Extracts relevant links from plain text and provides a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nKnowledgeBase[input]: Question answering model, particularly effective at answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :data[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given :data1:?\n\nThe function input should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with a data variable, e.g., KnowledgeBase[What is the capital of France, given :data2:?]\n\nEach plan step should only include one evidence output.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:data0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :data0:]\n:data1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :data0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:data[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was the architect behind the design of the Eiffel Tower and what other significant structures did they design?"
