        "content": "So I have this problem here. I need to make a 15% salt solution, and I have two solutions to work with: one that's 10% salt and another that's 20% salt. I need to mix these to get 100 mL of the 15% solution. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably define what I'm looking for. I need to find out how much of the 10% solution and how much of the 20% solution to mix together to get 100 mL of a 15% solution.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the volume in mL of the 10% solution.\n\n- Then, the volume of the 20% solution will be \\( 100 - x \\) mL, since the total volume needs to be 100 mL.\n\nNow, I need to consider the amount of salt in each part.\n\n- The amount of salt in the 10% solution is \\( 0.10x \\) mL.\n\n- The amount of salt in the 20% solution is \\( 0.20(100 - x) \\) mL.\n\n- The total amount of salt in the final solution should be \\( 0.15 \\times 100 = 15 \\) mL.\n\nSo, the equation that represents the total salt is:\n\n\\[ 0.10x + 0.20(100 - x) = 15 \\]\n\nNow, I can solve for \\( x \\):\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.10x + 20 - 0.20x = 15 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ -0.10x + 20 = 15 \\]\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\[ -0.10x = -5 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by -0.10:\n\n\\[ x = 50 \\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 50 \\) mL.\n\nThat means I need 50 mL of the 10% solution.\n\nNow, the volume of the 20% solution is:\n\n\\[ 100 - x = 100 - 50 = 50 \\] mL.\n\nWait, so it's 50 mL of each?\n\nLet me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf I have 50 mL of 10% salt, that's \\( 0.10 \\times 50 = 5 \\) mL of salt.\n\nAnd 50 mL of 20% salt is \\( 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\) mL of salt.\n\nTotal salt is \\( 5 + 10 = 15 \\) mL in 100 mL, which is 15% salt. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nIs there another way to think about this?\n\nYeah, I could think about it in terms of the differences in concentration.\n\nThe 10% solution is 5% below the target (15% - 10% = 5%).\n\nThe 20% solution is 5% above the target (20% - 15% = 5%).\n\nSo, since the differences are equal, mixing equal parts should give me the target concentration.\n\nThat matches what I calculated: 50 mL of each.\n\nIs there a general formula for this kind of problem?\n\nYes, it's called the method of alligation.\n\nAlligation is a technique used to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients at different prices or concentrations should be mixed to produce a mixture at a given price or concentration.\n\nIn this case, I have two solutions with concentrations C1 = 10% and C2 = 20%, and I want a mixture with concentration Cm = 15%.\n\nThe formula for the ratio in which to mix them is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{C2 - Cm}{Cm - C1} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{20 - 15}{15 - 10} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is 1:1, meaning equal parts of each solution.\n\nSince I need 100 mL total, it's 50 mL of each.\n\nThis matches what I found earlier.\n\nIs there another way to look at it, maybe using weights or something?\n\nWell, I could think of it in terms of weighted averages.\n\nThe final concentration is a weighted average of the two concentrations.\n\nLet me denote the volume of the 10% solution as \\( x \\) mL, and the volume of the 20% solution as \\( y \\) mL.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 100 \\) (total volume)\n\n2. \\( 0.10x + 0.20y = 15 \\) (total salt)\n\nI already solved this with \\( y = 100 - x \\), but maybe I can solve it with substitution or elimination.\n\nLet me use substitution again.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\( y = 100 - x \\)\n\nPlug into equation 2:\n\n\\( 0.10x + 0.20(100 - x) = 15 \\)\n\nWhich is the same equation I had before, leading to \\( x = 50 \\) mL.\n\nAlternatively, I could use elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 0.10:\n\n\\( 0.10x + 0.10y = 10 \\)\n\nNow subtract this from equation 2:\n\n\\( (0.10x + 0.20y) - (0.10x + 0.10y) = 15 - 10 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( 0.10y = 5 \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = 50 \\) mL.\n\nThen, from equation 1, \\( x = 100 - 50 = 50 \\) mL.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nIs there a graphical way to visualize this?\n\nYes, I can plot the two equations and find their intersection point.\n\nEquation 1: \\( y = 100 - x \\)\n\nEquation 2: \\( 0.10x + 0.20y = 15 \\)\n\nPlotting equation 1 is a straight line with slope -1 and y-intercept 100.\n\nFor equation 2:\n\nLet me solve for y in terms of x:\n\n\\( 0.10x + 0.20y = 15 \\)\n\n\\( 0.20y = 15 - 0.10x \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{15 - 0.10x}{0.20} = 75 - 0.5x \\)\n\nSo, equation 2 is \\( y = 75 - 0.5x \\)\n\nNow, set equation 1 equal to equation 2:\n\n\\( 100 - x = 75 - 0.5x \\)\n\nSolve for x:\n\n\\( 100 - 75 = x - 0.5x \\)\n\n\\( 25 = 0.5x \\)\n\n\\( x = 50 \\) mL\n\nThen, \\( y = 100 - 50 = 50 \\) mL.\n\nGraphically, the intersection point is at (50, 50), which is what we found.\n\nIs there a way to do this without using algebra, maybe just logical reasoning?\n\nWell, since both solutions are equally distant from the target concentration (5% difference each), it makes sense that mixing equal parts would give the target concentration.\n\nIf one solution were closer to the target than the other, I'd need more of the one that's closer to pull the average towards it.\n\nBut in this case, they're equidistant, so equal parts work fine.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nYes, it does.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the student should mix 50 mL of the 10% salt solution with 50 mL of the 20% salt solution to make 100 mL of a 15% salt solution.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider?\n\nWell, I should make sure that the volumes are additive. In other words, that when I mix 50 mL of one solution with 50 mL of the other, I get exactly 100 mL.\n\nIn most cases, volumes are additive for liquid solutions, so that should be fine.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that there are no chemical reactions between the solutions that might affect the volume or the concentration.\n\nBut since both solutions are just salt in water, and assuming they're both aqueous solutions, mixing them should just result in a mixture with the expected concentration.\n\nAlright, I think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ mL of 10% solution and 50 mL of 20% solution}} \\]"
