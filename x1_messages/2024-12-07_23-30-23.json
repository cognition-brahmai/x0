        "content": "So I've got this triangle with sides of 5 cm, 12 cm, and 13 cm, and I need to find its area. Hmm, I remember that there are different ways to find the area of a triangle, like using base and height, or using Heron's formula. But I'm not sure which one to use here.\n\nFirst, I should check if this is a right-angled triangle because that might make things easier. I know that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the longest side should equal the sum of the squares of the other two sides, according to the Pythagorean theorem. Let me see: 5 squared is 25, 12 squared is 144, and 13 squared is 169. Now, 25 plus 144 is 169, which matches the square of the longest side. So, yes, this is a right-angled triangle with the right angle between the sides of 5 cm and 12 cm.\n\nSince it's a right-angled triangle, I can use the formula for the area of a right-angled triangle, which is one-half times the base times the height. Here, the base and height are the two sides that form the right angle, so that's 5 cm and 12 cm.\n\nSo, area = (1/2) * 5 cm * 12 cm = (1/2) * 60 cm\u00b2 = 30 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to confirm this? Maybe using Heron's formula? Heron's formula says that the area of a triangle is equal to the square root of s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c), where s is half of the perimeter, and a, b, c are the lengths of the sides.\n\nLet me calculate s first. The perimeter is 5 cm + 12 cm + 13 cm = 30 cm, so s = 30 cm / 2 = 15 cm.\n\nNow, area = sqrt[15(15 - 5)(15 - 12)(15 - 13)] = sqrt[15 * 10 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[900] = 30 cm\u00b2.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the area is indeed 30 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other way to find the area here. Maybe using trigonometry, but since I don't have any angle measures, that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could use coordinates to plot the triangle and find the area using the coordinate formula, but that seems more complicated than necessary for this problem.\n\nNo, I think using the right-angled triangle area formula is the simplest and most direct method here, and Heron's formula confirms it.\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 30 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
