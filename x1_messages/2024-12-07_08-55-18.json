        "content": "Sure! Here's a Python function that prints the first n rows of Pascal's triangle:\n\n```python\ndef print_pascal_triangle(n):\n    triangle = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = [1] * (i+1)\n        triangle.append(row)\n\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            row[j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]\n\n    for row in triangle:\n        print(row)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint_pascal_triangle(5)\n```\n\nThis function first initializes an empty list to store the rows of the triangle. Then, for each row from 0 to n-1, it creates a list with i+1 elements, all set to 1, and appends it to the triangle list.\n\nNext, for each row beyond the first two rows, it calculates the internal values of the row by summing the two values from the row above.\n\nFinally, it prints each row of the triangle.\n\nWhen you call `print_pascal_triangle(5)`, it will print the first 5 rows of Pascal's triangle:\n\n```\n[1]\n[1, 1]\n[1, 2, 1]\n[1, 3, 3, 1]\n[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
