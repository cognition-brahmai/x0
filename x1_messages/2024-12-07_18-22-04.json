        "content": "So I've got this problem here about marbles in a bag. There are 5 red, 7 blue, and 8 green marbles. I need to find the probability of drawing a red one. Alright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is drawing a red marble.\n\nSo, the number of red marbles is 5. That should be the numerator of my probability fraction.\n\nNow, what's the total number of marbles? There are 5 red, 7 blue, and 8 green. Let's add those up: 5 plus 7 is 12, plus 8 is 20. Wait, that can't be right because 7 plus 8 is 15, plus 5 is 20. Yeah, total of 20 marbles.\n\nSo, the probability should be 5 over 20, which simplifies to 1 over 4, or 0.25, which is 25%. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Is there any chance that the marbles are not equally likely to be drawn? For example, are some marbles bigger than others, or is there something about the way they're placed in the bag that could affect the probability? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume all marbles are equally likely to be drawn.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the marbles are drawn with or without replacement. But since only one marble is being drawn, that shouldn't matter here.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify whether the drawing is random or not. But typically, in probability problems involving drawing items from a container, it's assumed to be a random draw unless otherwise specified.\n\nSo, sticking with the basic probability formula: probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes.\n\nIn this case, favorable is red marbles, which are 5, total marbles are 20.\n\nSo, 5/20 = 1/4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's a different way to approach this. Could I think about it in terms of percentages? Well, 5 out of 20 is indeed 25%.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider each marble as an individual entity, the probability of picking any one specific red marble would be 1/20. But since there are 5 red marbles, I would add those probabilities together: 1/20 + 1/20 + 1/20 + 1/20 + 1/20 = 5/20, which again is 1/4.\n\nSo, that matches my initial calculation.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe using combinations. The number of ways to choose 1 red marble out of 5 is C(5,1), and the total number of ways to choose any marble out of 20 is C(20,1). So, C(5,1)/C(20,1) = 5/20 = 1/4. Same answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough ways. The probability is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
