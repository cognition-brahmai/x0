        "content": "In the vast, blue canvas of day,\nClouds paint with freedom, in their own way.\nEach shape, a story, each form, a delight,\nA symphony of white in the sun's soft light.\n\nFirst comes the Cumulus, puffy and round,\nLike cotton balls drifted to the ground.\nThey bounce in the breeze, so light and free,\nInviting you to climb, just look and see.\n\nThen the Stratus moves in, a blanket so thin,\nCovering the sky, yet letting sun shine within.\nIt's a gentle hug from the heavens above,\nA soothing presence, a calming love.\n\nCirrus, the wisps, so high and thin,\nDancing on breezes, a ballet within.\nThey crisscross the sky, in patterns so fine,\nLike fairy trails, left behind in time.\n\nCumulonimbus, the thunderhead's might,\nTowers above, in stunning sight.\nThough it may storm, and lightning may flash,\nIts grandeur is awe-inspiring, a majestic clash.\n\nLenticular clouds, like saucers so sleek,\nPerched on mountain peaks, or in valleys meek.\nThey seem to hover, unmoving, serene,\nMysteries of the sky, in their elliptical sheen.\n\nMammatus clouds, like udders below,\nHanging from thunderheads, in a row.\nThey pulse and bulge, in a rhythmic sway,\nA surreal sight, in the gray of day.\n\nContrails from planes, like ribbons unfurled,\nCrossing the sky, in paths swirl.\nThey spread and fade, in time's gentle touch,\nMan's mark upon nature, in a mutualutch.\n\nNoctilucent clouds, in twilight's pale light,\nShimmer and shine, a sight so bright.\nAt heights unseen, in the mesosphere's realm,\nThey dance in the night, like a celestial helm.\n\nClouds, oh clouds, in your endless array,\nYou bring joy to the day, and peace to the fray.\nYou teach us of change, of form and of flight,\nIn your ever-shifting, majestic sight.\n\nSo I look up, with a smile so wide,\nAt your formations, side by side.\nYou are nature's art, in the sky so blue,\nA happy poem, forever true."
