        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 25 red marbles and 75 blue marbles in a bag, making a total of 100 marbles. I need to find the probability of picking a red marble twice in a row, with replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since it's with replacement, that means after I pick a marble, I put it back into the bag. So, each time I pick a marble, the total number of marbles remains the same, which is 100.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a red marble once. There are 25 red marbles out of 100, so the probability is 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25.\n\nSince I'm picking twice in a row and each pick is independent (because of replacement), I need to find the probability of both events happening. For independent events, I multiply their probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red marble twice in a row should be (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The first pick: probability of red is 25/100 = 1/4. Second pick: again, probability of red is 25/100 = 1/4. Since it's with replacement, the two picks are independent, so multiplying them makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations or counting outcomes, but since it's with replacement and independent picks, the multiplication method should work.\n\nSo, 1/4 times 1/4 is 1/16. That should be the answer.\n\nBut maybe I can look at it another way. The total number of possible outcomes for two picks is 100 * 100 = 10,000, since there are 100 choices each time.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes, which is picking a red marble both times, is 25 * 25 = 625, because there are 25 red marbles each time.\n\nSo, the probability is 625 / 10,000 = 0.0625, which is the same as 1/16.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that 1/16 is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any dependency between the picks? No, because of replacement. Is there any condition on the picks? No, it's just picking twice.\n\nAlso, making sure that I didn't mistake with the total number of marbles or the count of red marbles. Given it's 25 red out of 100, the probability is indeed 1/4 for each pick.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red marble twice in a row is 1/16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{16}} \\]"
