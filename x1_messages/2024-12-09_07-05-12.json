        "content": "Let's see. There are five people participating in a gift exchange. Each person brings one gift and leaves with one gift. I need to figure out how many gifts were exchanged in total.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an exchange means in this context. If each person brings one gift and leaves with one gift, it seems like they are giving their gift to someone else and receiving a gift from someone else.\n\nSo, for each person, there is one gift going out and one gift coming in. But I need to make sure I'm not double-counting here.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If there are five people, and each brings one gift, that means there are five gifts in total. Now, each person leaves with one gift, but it's not their own; it's a different gift.\n\nSo, the total number of gifts exchanged would be equal to the number of people, which is five, because each person is giving away one gift and receiving one gift.\n\nWait a minute, but in an exchange, when I give my gift to you, and you give your gift to me, that's two exchanges, right? So, maybe I need to consider each exchange as a transaction between two people.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's more like a secret Santa kind of thing, where each person gives their gift to one other person, and receives a gift from another person.\n\nIn that case, the total number of exchanges would still be equal to the number of people, because each person is involved in one giving and one receiving.\n\nSo, with five people, there are five gifts exchanged.\n\nBut let me check this with a smaller number to see if it makes sense.\n\nSuppose there are two people, A and B. A brings a gift for B, and B brings a gift for A. So, there are two exchanges: A gives to B, and B gives to A.\n\nWait, but in this case, each person is giving one gift and receiving one gift, so the total number of exchanges is two, which is equal to the number of people.\n\nNow, with three people: A, B, and C.\n\nA gives to B, B gives to C, and C gives to A. So, there are three exchanges, equal to the number of people.\n\nSimilarly, with four people: A gives to B, B gives to C, C gives to D, and D gives to A. Four exchanges, equal to the number of people.\n\nSo, by induction, with five people, there should be five exchanges.\n\nTherefore, the total number of gifts exchanged is five.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIf each person gives one gift and receives one gift, then the total number of gifts exchanged is equal to the number of people.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of permutations, since each person gives a gift to another person, and no one gives to themselves, this is like a derangement of the five gifts.\n\nBut in terms of counting the number of exchanges, it should still be equal to the number of people, because each person is involved in one exchange.\n\nSo, I think the answer is that five gifts were exchanged in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
