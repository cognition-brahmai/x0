        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence defined by T(n) = T(n-1) + n\u00b2, and it starts with T(1) = 1. I need to find T(6). Okay, so I'll probably have to calculate each term step by step up to n=6.\n\nStarting with T(1) = 1, that's given. Now, to find T(2), I'll use the formula:\n\nT(2) = T(1) + 2\u00b2 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nNext, T(3) = T(2) + 3\u00b2 = 5 + 9 = 14.\n\nThen, T(4) = T(3) + 4\u00b2 = 14 + 16 = 30.\n\nAfter that, T(5) = T(4) + 5\u00b2 = 30 + 25 = 55.\n\nFinally, T(6) = T(5) + 6\u00b2 = 55 + 36 = 91.\n\nSo, T(6) is 91.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to find T(n) without calculating each step? Maybe there's a general formula for T(n).\n\nLet me think about it. The recursive formula is T(n) = T(n-1) + n\u00b2. This looks like a summation. Starting from T(1) = 1, then adding 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2, up to n\u00b2.\n\nSo, T(n) = 1 + 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 + ... + n\u00b2.\n\nI know that the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\nSum = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nBut wait, in this sequence, T(1) = 1, which matches the sum of squares from 1 to 1. T(2) = 1 + 4 = 5, which matches the sum of squares up to 2. Similarly, T(3) = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14, which is the sum of squares up to 3.\n\nSo, it seems that T(n) is equal to the sum of squares from 1 to n.\n\nTherefore, T(n) = 1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 + ... + n\u00b2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nLet me verify this with n=6:\n\nT(6) = 6*7*13/6 = (6*7*13)/(6) = 7*13 = 91.\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier step by step.\n\nSo, the value of T(6) is 91.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check another value, say T(3):\n\nUsing the formula: T(3) = 3*4*7/6 = (3*4*7)/6 = (84)/6 = 14.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, so the general formula is T(n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.\n\nTherefore, T(6) = 91.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{91} \\]"
