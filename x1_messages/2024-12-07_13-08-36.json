Similarly, hosting a proper English tea requires an understanding of the ceremony's history and the careful selection of teas to complement the season and the mood. Each tea has its own character, much like each wine, I suppose. It's fascinating to see how different cultures have developed such intricate rituals around their beverages.\"\n\nLydia: \"Tea rituals? Please. In my book, nothing beats a good cup of Earl Grey paired with a healthy dose of sarcasm. But I do appreciate the effort, Martha. Now, speaking of pairings, I wonder if there's a bioinformatic algorithm out there that can suggest the perfect wine or tea based on one's genetic makeup. Maybe someday we'll have personalized beverages tailored to our DNA.\"\n\nLorenzo: \"That would be revolutionary, Lydia! Imagine walking into a bar, swiping your DNA card, and getting a cocktail uniquely crafted for your genetic palate. It sounds like the future of mixology. But until then, I'll stick to trusting my instincts and the feedback from my patrons.\"\n\nEdmund: \"Indeed, Lorenzo.
