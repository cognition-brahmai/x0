        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company charges $25 per day and an additional $0.10 per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for 3 days and driving it for 250 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for renting the car for 3 days. Since it's $25 per day, I'll multiply 25 by 3.\n\n25 * 3 = 75\n\nSo, the rental cost for 3 days is $75.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 250 miles. The charge is $0.10 per mile, so I'll multiply 0.10 by 250.\n\n0.10 * 250 = 25\n\nSo, the mileage cost is $25.\n\nNow, I'll add the rental cost and the mileage cost to get the total cost.\n\n75 + 25 = 100\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car for 3 days and drive it for 250 miles is $100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
