        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a group of people, and we're given some percentages about who wears glasses and hats.\n\nFirst, 60% of the group wears glasses, and 40% do not wear glasses. Among those who wear glasses, 70% also wear hats. We need to find out what percentage of the entire group is wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nAlright, so let's denote the total group as 100%. That makes it easier to work with percentages.\n\nSo, 60% wear glasses, and among them, 70% also wear hats. So, to find out how many wear both glasses and hats, I need to find 70% of the 60% who wear glasses.\n\nLet me calculate that. 70% of 60% is:\n\n(70/100) * 60% = 0.7 * 60% = 42%\n\nSo, 42% of the entire group wears both glasses and hats.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal group: 100%\n\nWearing glasses: 60%\n\nAmong wearing glasses, wearing hats: 70% of 60% = 42%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of actual numbers. Suppose the group has 100 people.\n\nNumber wearing glasses: 60% of 100 = 60 people\n\nAmong these 60, 70% also wear hats: 70% of 60 = 42 people\n\nSo, 42 out of 100 people wear both glasses and hats, which is 42%.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire group, the percentage wearing both glasses and hats is 42%.\n\nIs there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nWell, we could consider the percentage wearing hats among the entire group, but we don't have that information directly. We only know about hats among those who wear glasses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use some kind of formula or rule, but for this straightforward problem, the method I used seems sufficient.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance of overlap or other factors I'm missing. For example, are there people who wear hats but not glasses? The problem doesn't provide that information, and we don't need it to answer the question.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the percentage of the entire group that wears both glasses and hats, which we've determined to be 42%.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 42%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42\\%} \\]"
