        "content": "Let's see. The factory usually produces 100 cars per day. On Monday, they produce 20% more than usual. So, first, I need to calculate 20% of 100 cars.\n\n20% of 100 is (20/100) * 100 = 20 cars.\n\nSo, on Monday, they produce 100 + 20 = 120 cars.\n\nNow, on Tuesday, they produce 10% fewer cars than on Monday. So, I need to calculate 10% of 120 cars.\n\n10% of 120 is (10/100) * 120 = 12 cars.\n\nTherefore, on Tuesday, they produce 120 - 12 = 108 cars.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: producing 10% fewer cars than on Monday means producing 90% of Monday's production.\n\nSo, 90% of 120 is (90/100) * 120 = 108 cars.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the factory produces 108 cars on Tuesday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108} \\]"
