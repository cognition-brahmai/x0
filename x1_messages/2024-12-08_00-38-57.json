        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces 1500 items per day, and the defect rate is 1.5%. We need to find out how many defective items are produced in a week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the defect rate means. A defect rate of 1.5% means that 1.5% of the total items produced are defective. So, out of every 100 items produced, 1.5 are defective.\n\nNow, the factory produces 1500 items per day. To find out how many defective items are produced each day, I can calculate 1.5% of 1500.\n\nLet me recall how to calculate percentages. To find a percentage of a number, you multiply the number by the percentage and then divide by 100. So, for daily defective items:\n\nDefective items per day = (1.5% * 1500) / 100\n\nWait, actually, since 1.5% is equivalent to 1.5/100 = 0.015, I can simply multiply 1500 by 0.015.\n\nSo, Defective items per day = 1500 * 0.015\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n1500 * 0.015 = 22.5\n\nHmm, so there are 22.5 defective items per day. But since we can't have half an item, maybe the factory counts it as 23 or rounds it differently, but for now, I'll keep it as 22.5.\n\nNow, to find out how many defective items are produced in a week, I need to know how many days are in a week. Typically, a week has 7 days.\n\nSo, defective items per week = defective items per day * 7\n\nThat would be 22.5 * 7\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n22.5 * 7 = 157.5\n\nAgain, we end up with half an item, but for the sake of this calculation, I'll keep it as 157.5.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if my calculations are correct. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nFirst, defect rate is 1.5%, which is 0.015 in decimal form.\n\nProduction per day is 1500 items.\n\nSo, defective items per day = 1500 * 0.015 = 22.5\n\nThen, for a week (7 days): 22.5 * 7 = 157.5\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of total production in a week and then apply the defect rate.\n\nTotal production per week = 1500 items/day * 7 days = 10,500 items\n\nThen, defective items in a week = 1.5% of 10,500\n\nAgain, 1.5% of 10,500 is 0.015 * 10,500 = 157.5\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nBut now, I have to consider whether it's practical to have half a defective item. In reality, you can't have half a item, so perhaps the factory would round it to the nearest whole number, either 157 or 158.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify rounding, and since both methods give me 157.5, I'll go with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of expected value. The expected number of defective items per week is 157.5.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to look at it. Maybe I should consider that each item has a 1.5% chance of being defective, and with 10,500 items produced in a week, the expected number of defectives is 10,500 * 0.015 = 157.5.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the factory produces 157.5 defective items in a week, but since we're dealing with physical items, it's more appropriate to round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nLooking back at the 22.5 defective items per day, over 7 days, the total would be 157.5. If we consider that half items accumulate over the week, perhaps it's better to think of it as an average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the defect rate is not perfectly consistent each day, and some days have more defects than others.\n\nBut based on the information given, the most accurate answer is 157.5 defective items per week.\n\nHowever, since the number of defective items must be a whole number, it's likely that the actual number will vary around 157 or 158 items per week.\n\nBut to directly answer the question: how many defective items are produced in a week?\n\nThe answer is 157.5.\n\nBut considering practicality, the factory likely deals with whole items, so perhaps they report it as 157 or 158 items, depending on their rounding conventions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a quality control process that handles the half item differently.\n\nBut based on the calculation, 157.5 is the precise answer.\n\nI think I've thought about this enough. The answer is 157.5 defective items per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{157.5} \\]"
