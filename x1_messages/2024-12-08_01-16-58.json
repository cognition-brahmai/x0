        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Python script that fetches weather data from a REST API, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose a Weather API**: There are several weather APIs available, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, and AccuWeather. For this example, I'll use OpenWeatherMap because it's widely used and has a free tier.\n\n2. **Sign Up for an API Key**: You'll need to sign up on the OpenWeatherMap website to get an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests.\n\n3. **Install Required Libraries**: We'll use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the API. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip.\n\n4. **Write the Python Script**: The script will take a location as input, make a request to the API, and display the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Choose a Weather API\n\nI've chosen OpenWeatherMap for this example. It provides comprehensive weather data and has a simple API to work with.\n\n### Step 2: Sign Up for an API Key\n\nVisit the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account. Once you're logged in, you can find your API key on your account page.\n\n### Step 3: Install Required Libraries\n\nWe'll use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests. If it's not already installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\n### Step 4: Write the Python Script\n\nNow, let's write the Python script. We'll need to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint, passing the location and API key as parameters. Then, we'll parse the JSON response to extract the required weather data.\n\nHere's the complete script:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather_data(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        'q': city,\n        'appid': api_key,\n        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit\n    }\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        main = data['main']\n        weather = data['weather'][0]\n        temperature = main['temp']\n        humidity = main['humidity']\n        conditions = weather['description']\n        print(f\"City: {city}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Conditions: {conditions}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: {response.status_code}\")\n        print(response.json())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    city = input(\"Enter the city name: \")\n    api_key = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your actual API key\n    get_weather_data(city, api_key)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Import the requests library**: This library allows us to send HTTP requests easily.\n\n2. **Define the `get_weather_data` function**: This function takes a city name and an API key as parameters.\n   - Construct the API URL and parameters.\n   - Make a GET request to the API.\n   - If the request is successful (status code 200), parse the JSON response to extract temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.\n   - Print the extracted data in a user-friendly format.\n   - If there's an error, print the status code and response JSON.\n\n3. **Main block**: \n   - Prompt the user to enter a city name.\n   - Call the `get_weather_data` function with the user-provided city and your API key.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n- The `units` parameter in the API request is set to `'metric'` for Celsius. If you prefer Fahrenheit, set it to `'imperial'`.\n- This script assumes that the API returns data in the expected format. You might want to add more error handling for robustness.\n\nThat's it! You now have a Python script that fetches and displays weather data for a given location using a REST API."
