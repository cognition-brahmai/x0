        "content": "To develop a Node.js script that reads a JSON file containing an array of employee objects, filters out those with salaries below a specified threshold, and writes the filtered data to a new JSON file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your project**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` in your terminal and following the prompts.\n\n2. **Install necessary packages**: For this task, you'll need to work with file systems in Node.js. The built-in `fs` module should suffice. However, for better handling of asynchronous operations, you might want to use `fs/promises`.\n\n3. **Create the JSON file**: Prepare a JSON file (e.g., `employees.json`) with an array of employee objects. Each object should have properties like `name` and `salary`.\n\n4. **Write the script**: Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `filterEmployees.js`) and write the logic to read the JSON file, filter the employees based on the salary threshold, and write the filtered data to a new JSON file.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample implementation:\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### 1. Project Setup\n\nInitialize a new Node.js project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir employee-filter\ncd employee-filter\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n#### 2. Create the JSON File\n\nCreate a file named `employees.json` with the following content:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"salary\": 50000},\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"salary\": 60000},\n    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"salary\": 45000},\n    {\"name\": \"David\", \"salary\": 70000}\n]\n```\n\n#### 3. Write the Script\n\nCreate a file named `filterEmployees.js` and add the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs').promises;\n\nasync function main() {\n    try {\n        // Step 1: Read the JSON file\n        const data = await fs.readFile('employees.json', 'utf8');\n        const employees = JSON.parse(data);\n\n        // Step 2: Define the salary threshold\n        const threshold = 55000;\n\n        // Step 3: Filter employees based on the threshold\n        const filteredEmployees = employees.filter(employee => employee.salary >= threshold);\n\n        // Step 4: Write the filtered data to a new JSON file\n        await fs.writeFile('filteredEmployees.json', JSON.stringify(filteredEmployees, null, 2), 'utf8');\n        console.log('Filtered employees have been written to filteredEmployees.json');\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error processing files:', error);\n    }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the JSON File**:\n   - Use `fs.readFile` to read the contents of `employees.json`.\n   - Parse the JSON string into a JavaScript array using `JSON.parse`.\n\n2. **Defining the Threshold**:\n   - Set the salary threshold below which employees should be filtered out.\n\n3. **Filtering Employees**:\n   - Use the `filter` method on the array of employees to create a new array containing only those employees whose salary is greater than or equal to the threshold.\n\n4. **Writing the Filtered Data**:\n   - Use `fs.writeFile` to write the filtered array back to a new JSON file, `filteredEmployees.json`.\n   - Use `JSON.stringify` to convert the array to a JSON string, with indentation for better readability.\n\nThis script handles asynchronous file operations using promises, ensuring that each step completes before moving to the next, and provides error handling to catch and log any issues that occur during file processing."
