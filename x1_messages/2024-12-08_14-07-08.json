        "content": "So there's this problem here about a class of 25 students. Out of these, 12 are boys and the rest are girls. Then it says that 5 boys and 7 girls wear glasses, and I need to find out how many students in total do not wear glasses.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many girls there are in the class. Since there are 25 students in total and 12 of them are boys, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to get the number of girls.\n\nSo, number of girls = total students - number of boys = 25 - 12 = 13 girls.\n\nAlright, so there are 13 girls in the class.\n\nNow, out of these 12 boys, 5 wear glasses. Similarly, out of the 13 girls, 7 wear glasses.\n\nI need to find out how many students do not wear glasses. To do that, I can first find out how many students do wear glasses and then subtract that number from the total number of students.\n\nSo, total students who wear glasses = number of boys who wear glasses + number of girls who wear glasses = 5 + 7 = 12 students.\n\nNow, to find the number of students who do not wear glasses, I subtract the number of students who wear glasses from the total number of students.\n\nSo, students who do not wear glasses = total students - students who wear glasses = 25 - 12 = 13 students.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nI started with 25 students, 12 boys and 13 girls. Then, 5 boys and 7 girls wear glasses, which totals 12 students wearing glasses. Subtracting that from 25 gives me 13 students who do not wear glasses.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it by finding out how many boys do not wear glasses and how many girls do not wear glasses, and then adding those numbers together.\n\nSo, number of boys who do not wear glasses = total boys - boys who wear glasses = 12 - 5 = 7 boys.\n\nNumber of girls who do not wear glasses = total girls - girls who wear glasses = 13 - 7 = 6 girls.\n\nThen, total students who do not wear glasses = boys who do not wear glasses + girls who do not wear glasses = 7 + 6 = 13 students.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, it seems consistent.\n\nI think the answer is 13 students do not wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
