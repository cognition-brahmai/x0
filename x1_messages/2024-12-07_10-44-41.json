        "content": "Okay, so I need to calculate the surface area and volume of a sphere with a radius of 6 cm. I remember there are specific formulas for these, but I want to make sure I understand each step. Let's start with the surface area.\n\nFirst, the formula for the surface area (A) of a sphere is:\n\nA = 4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03c0 (pi) is approximately 3.14159\n\n- r is the radius of the sphere\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 6 cm, I can plug this value into the formula.\n\nSo, A = 4 * \u03c0 * (6 cm)\u00b2\n\nFirst, I need to square the radius:\n\n(6 cm)\u00b2 = 36 cm\u00b2\n\nNow, multiply that by \u03c0:\n\n36 cm\u00b2 * \u03c0 \u2248 36 cm\u00b2 * 3.14159 \u2248 113.097 cm\u00b2\n\nThen, multiply by 4:\n\n4 * 113.097 cm\u00b2 \u2248 452.389 cm\u00b2\n\nSo, the surface area is approximately 452.39 cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, let's calculate the volume (V) of the sphere. The formula for the volume is:\n\nV = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b3\n\nAgain, r is the radius, which is 6 cm.\n\nSo, V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * (6 cm)\u00b3\n\nFirst, cube the radius:\n\n(6 cm)\u00b3 = 216 cm\u00b3\n\nNow, multiply by \u03c0:\n\n216 cm\u00b3 * \u03c0 \u2248 216 cm\u00b3 * 3.14159 \u2248 678.584 cm\u00b3\n\nThen, multiply by 4/3:\n\n(4/3) * 678.584 cm\u00b3 \u2248 904.779 cm\u00b3\n\nSo, the volume is approximately 904.78 cm\u00b3.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Surface Area: 452.39 cm\u00b2\n\n- Volume: 904.78 cm\u00b3\n\nI should also make sure that I'm using the correct units. Since the radius is given in centimeters, the surface area should be in square centimeters (cm\u00b2) and the volume in cubic centimeters (cm\u00b3), which I have done.\n\nAdditionally, it's good to know that \u03c0 is an irrational number, so the exact value can't be fully expressed, but using approximately 3.14159 is sufficient for most calculations. Some problems might specify to use a different approximation, like 3.14 or even to leave the answer in terms of \u03c0, but in this case, I've used the more precise value.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the formulas are derived from integral calculus and geometric principles, but for our purposes, it's sufficient to use the standard formulas for surface area and volume of a sphere.\n\nOne more thing: if the problem had given the diameter instead of the radius, I would need to remember that the radius is half of the diameter. But since it provided the radius directly, I didn't have to do that conversion.\n\nLastly, it's always a good idea to check if the calculations make sense. For example, if I double the radius, the surface area should quadruple (since it's proportional to r\u00b2), and the volume should increase by a factor of 8 (since it's proportional to r\u00b3). So, if I had a sphere with radius 3 cm, its surface area would be about 113.097 cm\u00b2 and volume about 113.097 cm\u00b3, which are indeed roughly quarter and eighth of the values I calculated for radius 6 cm.\n\nI think that covers everything for calculating the surface area and volume of a sphere with a radius of 6 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nSurface Area: \\boxed{452.39 \\text{ cm}^2}\n\nVolume: \\boxed{904.78 \\text{ cm}^3}"
