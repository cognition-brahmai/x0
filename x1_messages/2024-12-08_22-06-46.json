The misconception may arise because colds are more common during colder months, but this is likely due to people spending more time indoors in close proximity to others, making it easier for viruses to spread. So, bundling up in cold weather is more about comfort and preventing other issues like hypothermia or frostbite, rather than avoiding colds."
