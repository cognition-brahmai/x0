This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebReader[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkPicker[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nAIM[input]: An artificial intelligence model capable of answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given #E1?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E0 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [#E[n] containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what was their most famous work?"
