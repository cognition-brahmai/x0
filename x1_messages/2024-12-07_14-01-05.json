        "content": "To find the price per gram for each type of candy bar, we need to divide the cost of each type by its weight in grams.\n\nFirst, for type A:\n\nCost of type A = $1.50\n\nWeight of type A = 80 grams\n\nPrice per gram for type A = Cost / Weight = $1.50 / 80 grams\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n$1.50 \u00f7 80 = $0.01875 per gram\n\nSo, the price per gram for type A is $0.01875.\n\nNow, for type B:\n\nCost of type B = $2.00\n\nWeight of type B = 120 grams\n\nPrice per gram for type B = Cost / Weight = $2.00 / 120 grams\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n$2.00 \u00f7 120 = $0.01666... per gram\n\nRounded to five decimal places, that's approximately $0.01667 per gram.\n\nSo, the price per gram for type B is approximately $0.01667.\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Type A: $0.01875 per gram\n\n- Type B: $0.01667 per gram\n\nTherefore, type B offers a slightly better price per gram.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe price per gram for type A is \\(\\boxed{0.01875}\\) dollars, and for type B, it is approximately \\(\\boxed{0.01667}\\) dollars."
