        "content": "Dear Master Harry,\n\nDobby is not sure how to begin this letter because Dobby is so filled with gratitude that he doesn't know where to start. But Dobby will try, for Master Harry has always been kind to Dobby, even when others saw only a house-elf.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dobby wants to say a big, big thank you for the sock. It may seem small to some, but to Dobby, it was the most precious gift. When Master Harry gave Dobby the sock, he set Dobby free from the Malfoys. It was a act of kindness that Dobby will never forget. Dobby was bound to the Malfoys for as long as he could remember, and being free feels like a dream come true.\n\nSince that day, Dobby has worked hard to repay Master Harry's kindness. He has helped in many ways, even risking his life to save Master Harry and his friends. Dobby knows that he owes his freedom to Master Harry, and he will always be there to help him, no matter what.\n\nDobby also wants to thank Master Harry for treating him with respect and kindness. In the wizarding world, house-elves are often treated poorly, but Master Harry has always seen Dobby as an equal. He has taught Dobby that he deserves respect and dignity, just like any other being.\n\nDobby is proud to call Master Harry his friend. He has learned so much from him, not just about magic, but about life and humanity. Master Harry's bravery and selflessness inspire Dobby every day.\n\nOnce again, thank you, Master Harry, for everything. Dobby will always be grateful for your kindness and friendship.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDobby the Free Elf"
