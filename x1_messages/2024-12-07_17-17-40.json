        "content": "So the company is growing its revenue at 6% every year, and right now, it's making $500,000 per year. We want to know how much it will make in 5 years. This sounds like a problem about compound growth, similar to how money grows in a bank with compound interest.\n\nLet me think about this. In compound interest, the amount of money increases by a certain percentage each period, and that increased amount then also earns interest in the next period. It's the same with revenue growth; each year's growth is based on the previous year's revenue.\n\nSo, the formula for compound interest is:\n\n\\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\(n\\) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.\n\nIn this case, the \"principal\" is the current annual revenue, which is $500,000, the growth rate \\(r\\) is 6%, or 0.06 in decimal form, and \\(n\\) is 5 years.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ A = 500,000 \\times (1 + 0.06)^5 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(1 + 0.06\\), which is \\(1.06\\).\n\nThen, raise \\(1.06\\) to the power of 5.\n\nLet me calculate \\(1.06^5\\).\n\n\\(1.06 \\times 1.06 = 1.1236\\)\n\n\\(1.1236 \\times 1.06 = 1.191016\\)\n\n\\(1.191016 \\times 1.06 = 1.26247696\\)\n\n\\(1.26247696 \\times 1.06 = 1.3382255576\\)\n\nSo, \\(1.06^5 \\approx 1.3382\\)\n\nNow, multiply that by the initial revenue:\n\n\\(500,000 \\times 1.3382 = 669,100\\)\n\nSo, the annual revenue in 5 years would be approximately $669,100.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to calculate this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the revenue year by year.\n\nStarting with $500,000.\n\nAfter year 1: \\(500,000 + 0.06 \\times 500,000 = 500,000 \\times 1.06 = 530,000\\)\n\nAfter year 2: \\(530,000 \\times 1.06 = 561,800\\)\n\nAfter year 3: \\(561,800 \\times 1.06 = 595,508\\)\n\nAfter year 4: \\(595,508 \\times 1.06 = 631,238.48\\)\n\nAfter year 5: \\(631,238.48 \\times 1.06 = 669,102.25\\)\n\nSo, approximately $669,102, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the company's annual revenue in 5 years will be about $669,102.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{669102} \\]"
