        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters by 500 meters, and he wants to divide it into square plots with equal side lengths. I need to figure out what the largest possible size for each square plot is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The field is rectangular, with dimensions 300m by 500m. He wants to divide it into squares, all of the same size, and I need to find the largest possible size for these squares.\n\nSo, the key here is that the squares have to fit perfectly into the rectangle without leaving any space over. That means the side length of the squares has to be a divisor of both the length and the width of the rectangle.\n\nIn other words, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 300 and 500. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both. But that might be time-consuming for larger numbers. Another method is to use prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I'll find the prime factors of 300 and 500.\n\nStarting with 300:\n\n300 \u00f7 2 = 150\n\n150 \u00f7 2 = 75\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25\n\n25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factors of 300 are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5, or 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b9 \u00d7 5\u00b2.\n\nNow, for 500:\n\n500 \u00f7 2 = 250\n\n250 \u00f7 2 = 125\n\n125 \u00f7 5 = 25\n\n25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factors of 500 are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5, or 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b3.\n\nTo find the GCD, I take the lowest power of all the prime factors that are common to both numbers.\n\nHere, the common prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nFor 2, the lowest power is 2\u00b2.\n\nFor 5, the lowest power is 5\u00b2.\n\nSo, GCD = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b2 = 4 \u00d7 25 = 100.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible size for each square plot is 100 meters by 100 meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf I have a square plot of 100m by 100m, how many such plots can I fit into the rectangular field?\n\nThe field is 300m by 500m.\n\nAlong the 300m side, 300 \u00f7 100 = 3 plots.\n\nAlong the 500m side, 500 \u00f7 100 = 5 plots.\n\nSo, in total, there would be 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 square plots.\n\nThat seems to make sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's a larger square that could be used.\n\nSuppose I choose a square plot of 150m by 150m.\n\nDoes that divide both 300 and 500 evenly?\n\n300 \u00f7 150 = 2, which is fine.\n\n500 \u00f7 150 = 3.333..., which is not an integer. So, it doesn't divide evenly. There would be some leftover space.\n\nTherefore, 150m is too large.\n\nWhat about 100m, as I previously calculated? 300 \u00f7 100 = 3, and 500 \u00f7 100 = 5, both integers. Perfect.\n\nIs there any larger size than 100m that divides both dimensions evenly?\n\nLet's see, maybe 200m.\n\n300 \u00f7 200 = 1.5, which is not an integer.\n\n500 \u00f7 200 = 2.5, also not integers.\n\nSo, 200m is too large.\n\nWhat about 50m?\n\n300 \u00f7 50 = 6, and 500 \u00f7 50 = 10, both integers.\n\nBut 50m is smaller than 100m.\n\nSimilarly, 10m would give 300 \u00f7 10 = 30 and 500 \u00f7 10 = 50, but again, smaller than 100m.\n\nSo, 100m seems to be the largest possible square plot size that fits perfectly into the rectangular field.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 300 and 500, which might be more efficient for larger numbers.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works as follows:\n\nGCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b), while a > b.\n\nSo, GCD(500, 300):\n\n500 \u00f7 300 = 1 with a remainder of 200.\n\nSo, GCD(500, 300) = GCD(300, 200).\n\nNow, 300 \u00f7 200 = 1 with a remainder of 100.\n\nSo, GCD(300, 200) = GCD(200, 100).\n\nNext, 200 \u00f7 100 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, GCD(200, 100) = 100.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the GCD is 100.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible square plot size is 100 meters by 100 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
