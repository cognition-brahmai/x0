        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from Town A to Town B at 50 mph and comes back at 75 mph, and the whole trip takes 5 hours. We need to find the distance between Town A and Town B.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're dealing with. There are two legs to this trip: going from A to B and coming back from B to A. Each leg has a different speed, so we'll need to handle them separately.\n\nLet's denote the distance between Town A and Town B as \\(d\\) miles. Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, we can express the time taken for each leg in terms of \\(d\\).\n\nFor the trip from A to B:\n\n- Speed: 50 mph\n\n- Distance: \\(d\\) miles\n\n- Time: \\(t_1 = \\frac{d}{50}\\) hours\n\nFor the return trip from B to A:\n\n- Speed: 75 mph\n\n- Distance: \\(d\\) miles\n\n- Time: \\(t_2 = \\frac{d}{75}\\) hours\n\nThe total time for the round trip is given as 5 hours, so:\n\n\\[ t_1 + t_2 = 5 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{50} + \\frac{d}{75} = 5 \\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\(d\\), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 50 and 75, and their least common multiple is 150.\n\nLet's rewrite each fraction with the denominator of 150:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{50} = \\frac{3d}{150} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{75} = \\frac{2d}{150} \\]\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3d}{150} + \\frac{2d}{150} = \\frac{5d}{150} = \\frac{d}{30} \\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{30} = 5 \\]\n\nTo find \\(d\\), multiply both sides by 30:\n\n\\[ d = 5 \\times 30 = 150 \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance between Town A and Town B is 150 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If the distance is 150 miles, then:\n\n- Time from A to B: \\( \\frac{150}{50} = 3 \\) hours\n\n- Time from B to A: \\( \\frac{150}{75} = 2 \\) hours\n\n- Total time: \\( 3 + 2 = 5 \\) hours, which matches the given total time.\n\nLooks good! Another way to approach this is to use the concept of average speed for the entire trip. The average speed for a round trip with different speeds is given by the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nThe formula for the average speed when distances are equal is:\n\n\\[ \\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{speed}_1 \\times \\text{speed}_2}{\\text{speed}_1 + \\text{speed}_2} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times 50 \\times 75}{50 + 75} = \\frac{7500}{125} = 60 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nNow, if the average speed for the entire round trip is 60 mph and the total time is 5 hours, then the total distance for the round trip is:\n\n\\[ \\text{total distance} = \\text{average speed} \\times \\text{total time} = 60 \\times 5 = 300 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSince this is the round trip distance, the one-way distance from Town A to Town B is half of that:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{300}{2} = 150 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier result. So, the distance between Town A and Town B is indeed 150 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
