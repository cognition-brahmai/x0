        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a man with 3 daughters. And each daughter has twice as many brothers as sisters. I need to figure out how many children he has in total.\n\nFirst, I know that he has 3 daughters. Let's denote the number of sons as S. So, the total number of children is 3 (daughters) plus S (sons).\n\nNow, each daughter has some number of sisters and brothers. Sisters would be the other daughters, and brothers would be the sons.\n\nLet's think about how many sisters each daughter has. If there are 3 daughters, then each daughter has 2 sisters (since she doesn't count herself).\n\nWait, but the problem says each daughter has twice as many brothers as sisters. So, sisters would be the other daughters, which is 2, and brothers would be the sons, which is S.\n\nSo, according to the problem, for each daughter:\n\nNumber of brothers = 2 \u00d7 Number of sisters\n\nSo, S = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nEach daughter has 2 sisters and S brothers. According to the problem, S = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4.\n\nSo, the man has 3 daughters and 4 sons, making a total of 7 children.\n\nBut let's verify this.\n\nIf there are 4 sons, then each daughter has 4 brothers and 2 sisters. So, twice as many brothers as sisters would be 2 \u00d7 2 = 4, which matches the number of brothers. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's try to generalize it.\n\nLet D be the number of daughters, which is given as 3.\n\nLet S be the number of sons.\n\nFor each daughter:\n\nNumber of sisters = D - 1 (since she doesn't count herself)\n\nNumber of brothers = S\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\nS = 2 \u00d7 (D - 1)\n\nGiven D = 3:\n\nS = 2 \u00d7 (3 - 1) = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n\nSo, again, S = 4.\n\nTotal children = D + S = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trickier and considers the brothers to include themselves, but no, that doesn't make sense. Brothers are only the male children, and sisters are only the female children, excluding themselves.\n\nWait, but in the standard terminology, brothers are only the male siblings excluding oneself, and sisters are the female siblings excluding oneself.\n\nSo, yes, each daughter has 2 sisters and S brothers.\n\nSo, the equation S = 2 \u00d7 (D - 1) holds.\n\nGiven D = 3, S = 4, total children = 7.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
