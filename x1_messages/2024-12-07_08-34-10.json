        "content": "The Sargasso Sea is located in the Atlantic Ocean. It's bounded by four ocean currents - the North Atlantic Current to the north, the Gulf Stream to the west, the North Equatorial Current to the south, and the Canary Current to the east. What's fascinating about the Sargasso Sea is that, unlike other seas, it doesn't have any land boundaries. Instead, it's defined by these ocean currents that circulate in a clockwise manner, creating a distinct body of water. The Sargasso Sea is also known for its abundant floating Sargassum seaweed, from which it gets its name. This seaweed provides a habitat for various marine species, including turtles, eels, and birds."
