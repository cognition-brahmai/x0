        "content": "So, there are 1000 cars on the highway, and 60% of them are red. I need to find out how many non-red cars there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cars are red. Since 60% of the cars are red, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 1000.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 1000, I can multiply 1000 by 0.60 (because 60% is the same as 0.60 in decimal form).\n\nSo, 1000 times 0.60 is 600. That means there are 600 red cars.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-red cars, I can subtract the number of red cars from the total number of cars.\n\nTotal cars are 1000, and red cars are 600, so 1000 minus 600 equals 400.\n\nTherefore, there are 400 non-red cars on the highway.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of non-red cars first and then find the number.\n\nIf 60% of the cars are red, then the remaining percentage must be non-red cars.\n\nSo, 100% minus 60% equals 40%. That means 40% of the cars are non-red.\n\nThen, to find the number of non-red cars, I can calculate 40% of 1000.\n\nAgain, 40% is 0.40 in decimal form, so 1000 times 0.40 is 400.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 400 non-red cars.\n\nI think that makes sense. I can be confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
