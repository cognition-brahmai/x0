Useful for finding lists of websites that might have the required information.\nSiteReader[input]: Reads the content of one or more websites specified by newline-separated links in the input string.\nURLExtractor[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and returns them as newline-separated strings.\nInfoModel[input]: An AI model that can answer questions based on a given context. The input should be a textual question that references a #E[n] variable, like \"What is the population of Paris, given #E1?\"\n\nEach plan should be followed by exactly one evidence (#E[index]) value.\n\nThe output should look like this:\nPlan: [first action based on the input question]\n#E1 = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on the result of #E1]\n#E2 = [next function call and input parameter, possibly referencing previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E1\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: What is the tallest building in New York City and when was it completed?"

I have a few tools at my disposal: DuckDuckGo for searching, SiteReader to read website content, URLExtractor to get URLs from text, and InfoModel to answer questions based on given context.\n\nFirst, I should probably search for the tallest building in New York City. I can use DuckDuckGo for that. So, I'll perform a search with the query \"tallest building in New York City.\"\n\nPlan: Search for the tallest building in New York City.\n#E1 = DuckDuckGo[\"tallest building in New York City\"]\n\nNow, #E1 will contain a list of websites that might have the information I need. Next, I need to extract the URLs from this search result so I can read the content of these websites.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the search results.\n#E2 = URLExtractor[#E1]\n\nWith the URLs in hand, I can use SiteReader to read the content of these websites.\n\nPlan: Read the content of the websites.\n#E3 = SiteReader[#E2]\n\nNow, #E3 contains the text content from the websites. I need to find out which building is the tallest and when it was completed. I can use InfoModel to answer this question based on the context provided in #E3.\n\nPlan: Ask InfoModel to identify the tallest building and its completion date.\n#E4 = InfoModel[\"What is the tallest building in New York City and when was it completed?
