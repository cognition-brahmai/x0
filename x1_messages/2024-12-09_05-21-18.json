        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how much the company earns from selling all the products in 30 days and then subtract the total production costs to find the profit.\n\nSo, the company produces 200 units per day. If they do this for 30 days, the total number of units produced would be:\n\n200 units/day \u00d7 30 days = 6,000 units\n\nNext, each unit is sold for $25, so the total revenue from selling all these units would be:\n\n6,000 units \u00d7 $25/unit = $150,000\n\nNow, the production cost for each unit is $15, so the total production cost for 6,000 units would be:\n\n6,000 units \u00d7 $15/unit = $90,000\n\nTo find the profit, we subtract the total production cost from the total revenue:\n\n$150,000 - $90,000 = $60,000\n\nSo, the company's profit after selling all the products produced in 30 days is $60,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I haven't missed anything. Is there any other cost involved, like overhead costs or selling expenses? The problem doesn't mention any other costs, so I think just the production cost per unit is what we need to consider.\n\nAlso, it says they produce 200 units per day and sell each unit for $25, but it doesn't specify if all the produced units are sold. However, the question says \"after selling all the products produced in 30 days,\" so we can assume that all 6,000 units are sold.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any variable costs or fixed costs mentioned. Again, the problem only provides the production cost per unit and the selling price per unit, so it seems like we just need to calculate based on those.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe there's a simpler way to calculate the daily profit and then multiply by 30 days.\n\nFirst, find the profit per unit:\n\nSelling price per unit - production cost per unit = $25 - $15 = $10 profit per unit\n\nThen, daily profit would be:\n\n200 units/day \u00d7 $10/unit = $2,000/day\n\nOver 30 days, the total profit would be:\n\n$2,000/day \u00d7 30 days = $60,000\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation, so I'm confident that $60,000 is the correct profit.\n\nAlternatively, we could look at the total revenue and total cost separately and then find the difference.\n\nTotal revenue (TR) = price per unit \u00d7 quantity sold = $25 \u00d7 6,000 = $150,000\n\nTotal cost (TC) = cost per unit \u00d7 quantity produced = $15 \u00d7 6,000 = $90,000\n\nProfit (\u03c0) = TR - TC = $150,000 - $90,000 = $60,000\n\nSame result.\n\nI think this is straightforward. The company makes a profit of $60,000 after selling all the products produced in 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60000} \\]"
