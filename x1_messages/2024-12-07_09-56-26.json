        "content": "So the city has a budget of $5 million to upgrade its public transportation system by adding electric buses. Each electric bus costs $250,000, and there's also a charging infrastructure cost of $1 million. I need to find out two things: the maximum number of electric buses the city can purchase within its budget and the total daily mileage capacity of the new fleet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total costs involved. There are two main costs: the cost of the buses themselves and the cost of the charging infrastructure.\n\nThe charging infrastructure costs $1 million, and this is a one-time cost for the entire fleet, not per bus. So, regardless of how many buses they buy, the charging infrastructure will cost $1 million.\n\nThe city's total budget is $5 million. So, if $1 million is allocated for charging infrastructure, the remaining budget for buying buses is:\n\n$5,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $4,000,000\n\nNow, each bus costs $250,000. To find out how many buses can be purchased with $4 million, I divide the remaining budget by the cost per bus:\n\n$4,000,000 \u00f7 $250,000 = 16\n\nSo, the city can purchase 16 electric buses with its budget.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the total daily mileage capacity of the new fleet. Each bus has a range of 200 miles on a single charge. Assuming that each bus can be charged once a day, the daily mileage capacity per bus is 200 miles.\n\nTherefore, for 16 buses, the total daily mileage capacity would be:\n\n16 buses \u00d7 200 miles/bus = 3,200 miles\n\nHowever, in reality, there might be limitations on how many times a bus can be charged in a day, or there might be constraints on operating hours. But based on the information provided, assuming each bus can be charged once a day and operates up to its full range each day, the total daily mileage capacity would be 3,200 miles.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider whether the charging infrastructure can support all 16 buses. The problem states that the charging infrastructure cost is $1 million, but it doesn't specify how many buses it can support. Maybe the $1 million is for a certain number of charging stations, and each station can charge a certain number of buses.\n\nHmm, the problem doesn't provide details on the charging infrastructure's capacity in terms of the number of buses it can support. It just gives a flat cost of $1 million for charging infrastructure.\n\nIn such cases, I might need to make an assumption. Perhaps the charging infrastructure is designed to support the entire fleet of 16 buses. Since the problem doesn't specify any limitations on the charging infrastructure's capacity beyond the cost, I'll proceed with the assumption that the $1 million charging infrastructure can support the 16 buses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the charging infrastructure cost is fixed, regardless of the number of buses. But that seems less likely. Perhaps the $1 million is for a certain number of charging stations, and adding more buses wouldn't require additional charging infrastructure cost up to a certain point.\n\nHowever, without specific information, I'll stick with the initial approach: subtract the charging infrastructure cost from the total budget and use the remaining budget to purchase as many buses as possible.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Total budget: $5,000,000\n\n- Charging infrastructure cost: $1,000,000\n\n- Remaining budget for buses: $4,000,000\n\n- Cost per bus: $250,000\n\n- Number of buses: $4,000,000 \u00f7 $250,000 = 16 buses\n\n- Range per bus: 200 miles\n\n- Total daily mileage capacity: 16 buses \u00d7 200 miles/bus = 3,200 miles\n\nTherefore, the city can purchase 16 electric buses, and the total daily mileage capacity of the new fleet would be 3,200 miles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if there are any other costs that might be associated with purchasing and operating electric buses that aren't accounted for in the given budget. For example, maintenance costs, driver salaries, route planning, etc.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the budget is for \"adding electric buses to its fleet\" and mentions the costs of the buses and charging infrastructure. It doesn't mention any other costs, so I'll assume that these are the only costs considered in the budget.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any subsidies or incentives for purchasing electric buses that might reduce the effective cost per bus. But again, the problem doesn't mention any such incentives, so I'll proceed with the given cost per bus.\n\nAnother consideration is the lifespan of the buses and whether the budget accounts for replacement costs. But since the problem is focused on the initial purchase within the given budget, I won't factor in replacement costs.\n\nFurthermore, I should consider if the charging infrastructure cost is a one-time cost or if it includes ongoing operational costs. The problem doesn't specify, but given that it's referred to as \"charging infrastructure costs,\" it likely includes the initial setup cost, possibly including some operational costs. But again, without specific information, I'll treat the $1 million as a one-time cost for the infrastructure.\n\nI should also consider if there are any constraints on how the budget is allocated between buses and charging infrastructure. For example, maybe a certain percentage of the budget must be allocated to charging infrastructure. But the problem doesn't impose any such constraints, so I'll allocate the costs as described.\n\nAdditionally, I might consider the efficiency of the fleet. For instance, if the city's current transportation needs require a certain daily mileage, I could compare that to the total daily mileage capacity of the new fleet to see if it meets the\u9700\u6c42. However, since the problem doesn't specify the city's transportation needs, I'll focus on calculating the maximum number of buses and the total daily mileage capacity based on the given budget.\n\nMoreover, I could consider the environmental impact or the reduction in emissions by switching to electric buses, but again, the problem doesn't ask for that information.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided information and the assumptions made, the city can purchase 16 electric buses within its $5 million budget, after accounting for the $1 million charging infrastructure cost, and the total daily mileage capacity of the new fleet would be 3,200 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16 \\text{ buses, 3,200 miles daily mileage capacity}} \\]"
