        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in the room, and 99% of them are wearing glasses. So, that means 99 people are wearing glasses. Now, I need to figure out how many people must leave the room to make the percentage of people wearing glasses exactly 98%.\n\nHmm, let's denote the number of people who leave the room as x. So, after x people leave, the total number of people in the room will be 100 - x.\n\nNow, among these x people who leave, some may be wearing glasses and some may not. But the problem doesn't specify how many of them are wearing glasses, so I need to consider different scenarios.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the percentage of people wearing glasses\" should be 98%. It doesn't specify that only people wearing glasses leave or only those not wearing glasses leave. So, I think I need to consider that any combination of people leaving could affect the percentage.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way to approach this. Let's assume that the people leaving can be a mix of those wearing glasses and those not wearing glasses. Let's denote:\n\n- The number of people wearing glasses who leave as g.\n\n- The number of people not wearing glasses who leave as n.\n\nSo, the total number of people leaving is x = g + n.\n\nAfter x people leave, the number of people wearing glasses left in the room is 99 - g, and the total number of people left is 100 - x.\n\nWe want the percentage of people wearing glasses to be 98%, so:\n\n(99 - g) / (100 - x) = 98/100 = 0.98\n\nBut since x = g + n, and we don't know how many glasses-wearers and non-glasses-wearers are leaving, this seems a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe there's another way. Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of people not wearing glasses.\n\nInitially, there is 1 person not wearing glasses (since 99% wear glasses in a group of 100).\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of people leaving as x, and assume that y of them are wearing glasses, and x - y are not wearing glasses.\n\nAfter x people leave, the number of people wearing glasses is 99 - y, and the total number of people is 100 - x.\n\nWe want:\n\n(99 - y) / (100 - x) = 98/100\n\nBut this still has two variables, y and x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the number of people not wearing glasses compared to the total number should be 2%.\n\nWait, 98% are wearing glasses, so 2% are not wearing glasses.\n\nInitially, there is 1 person not wearing glasses out of 100.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of people leaving as x, and suppose that z of them are not wearing glasses.\n\nSo, the number of people not wearing glasses leaving is z, and the number of people wearing glasses leaving is x - z.\n\nAfter x people leave, the number of people not wearing glasses is 1 - z, and the total number of people is 100 - x.\n\nWe want the percentage of people not wearing glasses to be 2%, so:\n\n(1 - z) / (100 - x) = 2/100 = 0.02\n\nThis gives:\n\n1 - z = 0.02*(100 - x)\n\nBut I still have two variables here, z and x.\n\nMaybe I need another equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that only people not wearing glasses leave, or only those wearing glasses leave, and see if that works.\n\nLet\u2019s try assuming that only people not wearing glasses leave. So, z = x, meaning all x people leaving are not wearing glasses.\n\nThen, the number of people not wearing glasses left is 1 - x, and the total number of people left is 100 - x.\n\nSet up the equation:\n\n(1 - x)/(100 - x) = 0.02\n\nSolve for x:\n\n1 - x = 0.02*(100 - x)\n\n1 - x = 2 - 0.02x\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n- x + 0.02x = 2 - 1\n\n-0.98x = 1\n\nx = 1 / (-0.98)\n\nx \u2248 -1.0204\n\nWait, a negative number of people? That doesn't make sense. So, my assumption that only people not wearing glasses leave must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, only people wearing glasses leave.\n\nSo, z = 0, meaning no one not wearing glasses leaves.\n\nThen, the number of people not wearing glasses left is 1 - 0 = 1, and the total number of people left is 100 - x.\n\nSet up the equation:\n\n1 / (100 - x) = 0.02\n\nSolve for x:\n\n1 = 0.02*(100 - x)\n\n1 = 2 - 0.02x\n\n0.02x = 2 - 1\n\n0.02x = 1\n\nx = 1 / 0.02\n\nx = 50\n\nSo, if 50 people wearing glasses leave, then the number of people left is 50, and the number wearing glasses is 99 - 50 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 wearing glasses out of 50 people is 98%.\n\nThat seems to work.\n\nBut maybe there are other possibilities where both glasses-wearers and non-glasses-wearers leave.\n\nLet\u2019s check.\n\nSuppose some people wearing glasses and some not wearing glasses leave.\n\nLet\u2019s say y people wearing glasses leave and z people not wearing glasses leave, with y + z = x.\n\nThen, the number of people wearing glasses left is 99 - y, and the total number of people left is 100 - x.\n\nWe want:\n\n(99 - y)/(100 - x) = 0.98\n\nBut since z people not wearing glasses leave, z \u2264 1, because only 1 person is not wearing glasses initially.\n\nWait, there's only 1 person not wearing glasses. So, z can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf z = 0, then x = y, meaning only glasses-wearers leave.\n\nWe already did this case, and it gives x = 50.\n\nIf z = 1, then x = y + 1.\n\nSo, the number of glasses-wearers leaving is y, and the non-glasses-wearer also leaves.\n\nThen, the number of glasses-wearers left is 99 - y, and the total number of people left is 100 - (y + 1) = 99 - y.\n\nSet up the equation:\n\n(99 - y)/(99 - y) = 0.98\n\nWait, that would be 1 = 0.98, which is not possible.\n\nSo, this case doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible solution is that 50 glasses-wearers leave, and no one not wearing glasses leaves.\n\nHence, the answer is that 50 people must leave the room.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to interpret this?\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s let n be the number of people left in the room after some leave.\n\nWe want the percentage of glasses-wearers to be 98%, so the number of glasses-wearers left is 0.98n.\n\nInitially, there are 99 glasses-wearers and 1 non-glasses-wearer.\n\nThe number of glasses-wearers left must be 0.98n, and the total number of people left is n.\n\nSo, the number of non-glasses-wearers left is n - 0.98n = 0.02n.\n\nBut there is only 1 non-glasses-wearer initially, so the number of non-glasses-wearers leaving is 1 - 0.02n.\n\nSimilarly, the number of glasses-wearers leaving is 99 - 0.98n.\n\nSince the number of people leaving is (99 - 0.98n) + (1 - 0.02n) = 100 - n.\n\nBut this seems a bit circular.\n\nAlternatively, set up an equation based on the percentage.\n\nWe have:\n\nNumber of glasses-wearers left / total people left = 98/100\n\nSo:\n\n(99 - g)/(100 - x) = 0.98\n\nAnd since g = x - z, and z can be 0 or 1.\n\nBut earlier, only z = 0 seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve the equation directly.\n\nFrom:\n\n(99 - g)/(100 - x) = 0.98\n\nAnd g = x - z, with z \u2264 1.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nLet me try to solve the equation assuming z = 0.\n\nSo, g = x.\n\nThen:\n\n(99 - x)/(100 - x) = 0.98\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n99 - x = 0.98*(100 - x)\n\n99 - x = 98 - 0.98x\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n99 - 98 = -0.98x + x\n\n1 = 0.02x\n\nx = 1 / 0.02\n\nx = 50\n\nSo, again, x = 50.\n\nAlternatively, if z = 1, then g = x - 1.\n\nThen:\n\n(99 - (x - 1))/(100 - x) = 0.98\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n99 - x + 1 = 100 - x\n\nSo:\n\n(100 - x)/(100 - x) = 0.98\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 = 0.98, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 50, with z = 0.\n\nSo, 50 glasses-wearers must leave the room.\n\nBut let's check if there are other possible values.\n\nSuppose that some non-glasses-wearers leave along with glasses-wearers, but since there's only 1 non-glasses-wearer, the maximum z can be is 1.\n\nWe already saw that z = 1 doesn't work, so the only feasible solution is x = 50, z = 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that 50 people must leave the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
