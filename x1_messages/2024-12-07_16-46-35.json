        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this puzzle about a man with three daughters. The product of their ages is 36, and the sum of their ages is equal to the house number across the street. Also, the oldest daughter has a dog. We need to find out the ages of the daughters.\n\nFirst, I need to list all possible combinations of three positive integers whose product is 36. Since the order doesn't matter (ages are just numbers, not tied to specific daughters), I'll consider combinations where the order isn't important.\n\nLet's list the possible triplets:\n\n1. 1, 1, 36 (sum = 38)\n\n2. 1, 2, 18 (sum = 21)\n\n3. 1, 3, 12 (sum = 16)\n\n4. 1, 4, 9 (sum = 14)\n\n5. 1, 6, 6 (sum = 13)\n\n6. 2, 2, 9 (sum = 13)\n\n7. 2, 3, 6 (sum = 11)\n\n8. 3, 3, 4 (sum = 10)\n\nSo, these are all the possible combinations where the product is 36.\n\nNow, the sum of their ages is equal to the house number across the street. But I don't know the house number, so I need to find a way to narrow down the possibilities using the information given.\n\nWait, there's another piece of information: the oldest daughter has a dog. This implies that there is an oldest daughter, meaning that not all daughters are of the same age. So, we can eliminate any combinations where two or more daughters have the same age.\n\nWait, but in some combinations, like 1,6,6 and 2,2,9, there are daughters with the same age. If two daughters are the same age, there would be no unique \"oldest\" daughter. Therefore, those combinations can be eliminated.\n\nSo, let's eliminate:\n\n- 1,6,6\n\n- 2,2,9\n\nNow, the remaining possible combinations are:\n\n1. 1,1,36 (sum = 38)\n\n2. 1,2,18 (sum = 21)\n\n3. 1,3,12 (sum = 16)\n\n4. 1,4,9 (sum = 14)\n\n5. 2,3,6 (sum = 11)\n\n6. 3,3,4 (sum = 10)\n\nBut wait, in the combination 3,3,4, there are two daughters aged 3, so again, there is no unique oldest daughter. So, we need to eliminate this as well.\n\nNow, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. 1,1,36 (sum = 38)\n\n2. 1,2,18 (sum = 21)\n\n3. 1,3,12 (sum = 16)\n\n4. 1,4,9 (sum = 14)\n\n5. 2,3,6 (sum = 11)\n\nNow, the sum of their ages is equal to the house number across the street. The fact that the sum is equal to the house number suggests that this sum is unique, meaning that there is only one possible combination that matches this sum.\n\nBut, in the remaining combinations, we have different sums: 38, 21, 16, 14, and 11.\n\nWait, but in the original list, before eliminating the duplicates, there were two combinations that sum to 13: 1,6,6 and 2,2,9. But since we've eliminated those, all the remaining sums are unique.\n\nWait, but in the initial list, 1,6,6 sums to 13 and 2,2,9 also sums to 13. But since we've eliminated those, now each remaining sum is unique.\n\nTherefore, the sum must be one of these unique sums: 38, 21, 16, 14, or 11.\n\nBut the problem is that the sum is equal to the house number across the street, and presumably, the house number is a specific number.\n\nHowever, since we don't know the house number, how do we determine which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the house number is such that it allows us to uniquely determine the ages when combined with the other information.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the sum is unique only after eliminating the combinations where there is no unique oldest daughter.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose the sum was 11. Then, the only combination that sums to 11 is 2,3,6. So, if the house number was 11, then the ages would be 2,3,6.\n\nSimilarly, if the house number was 14, the ages would be 1,4,9.\n\nBut, in the problem, it's stated that the oldest daughter has a dog, which implies that there is an oldest daughter, meaning that the ages are distinct, which we've already used to eliminate some combinations.\n\nWait, but in the remaining combinations, all have distinct ages.\n\nWait, in 1,1,36, there are two 1-year-olds, but we've already eliminated that because there is no unique oldest daughter.\n\nWait, but 1,1,36 has two 1-year-olds and one 36-year-old, so the oldest is 36, unique.\n\nWait, maybe I should reconsider eliminating 1,1,36.\n\nIf there are two daughters aged 1, and one aged 36, then the oldest is 36, unique.\n\nSimilarly, 1,2,18: ages are distinct.\n\n1,3,12: distinct.\n\n1,4,9: distinct.\n\n2,3,6: distinct.\n\n3,3,4: two 3-year-olds, so no unique oldest.\n\nSo, only 3,3,4 is eliminated.\n\nThe rest have unique oldest daughters.\n\nSo, possible combinations are:\n\n1. 1,1,36 (sum=38)\n\n2. 1,2,18 (sum=21)\n\n3. 1,3,12 (sum=16)\n\n4. 1,4,9 (sum=14)\n\n5. 2,3,6 (sum=11)\n\nNow, the sum is equal to the house number.\n\nBut, in the original list, before elimination, there were multiple combinations with the same sum: 1,6,6 and 2,2,9 both sum to 13.\n\nBut since we've eliminated those, now each remaining sum is unique.\n\nSo, perhaps the house number is one of these sums: 38,21,16,14,11.\n\nBut, the problem is that the house number is supposed to allow the sum to be determined uniquely.\n\nWait, perhaps there is some additional implication.\n\nWait, maybe the house number is such that without the information about the oldest daughter having a dog, there would be ambiguity, but with that information, it's unique.\n\nIn other words, perhaps initially, with just the product and sum, there are multiple possibilities, but the oldest daughter having a dog resolves it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the house number is 13, which is the sum for both 1,6,6 and 2,2,9, but since those are eliminated because of the oldest daughter being unique, the house number can't be 13.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's said that the sum is equal to the house number, and the house number is a specific number.\n\nPerhaps the house number is such that there are multiple combinations with the same sum, but the oldest daughter having a dog resolves it.\n\nWait, but in our current list, after elimination, each sum is unique.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the house number is 13, and without the information about the oldest daughter, there would be ambiguity between 1,6,6 and 2,2,9, but with the information that there is an oldest daughter, we can eliminate those.\n\nBut, in that case, the house number can't be 13, because those combinations are eliminated.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the house number is such that there are multiple possible age combinations summing to it, but the oldest daughter having a dog resolves it by indicating that there is a unique oldest daughter.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at the original puzzle.\n\n\"A man has three daughters. The product of their ages is 36, and the sum of their ages is equal to the house number across the street. The oldest daughter has a dog. What are the ages of his daughters?\"\n\nSo, the key point is that the sum is equal to the house number, and the oldest daughter has a dog.\n\nPerhaps the house number is such that, without knowing about the oldest daughter, there are multiple possible age combinations, but the oldest daughter having a dog indicates which one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the house number is 13, which would correspond to both 1,6,6 and 2,2,9, but since the oldest daughter has a dog, and in both cases, there is an oldest daughter, but in 1,6,6, the oldest is 6, and in 2,2,9, the oldest is 9.\n\nBut, in both cases, there is an oldest daughter.\n\nWait, but in 1,6,6, the oldest is 6, and in 2,2,9, the oldest is 9.\n\nSo, perhaps the house number is 13, and the oldest daughter having a dog indicates which one is correct.\n\nBut, in the problem, it's specified that the oldest daughter has a dog, which might be intended to indicate that there is an oldest daughter, i.e., the ages are not all the same.\n\nBut, in our earlier elimination, we've already considered that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is just to provide additional information to distinguish between otherwise similar scenarios.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the house number is 13, and without the dog information, there are two possible combinations: 1,6,6 and 2,2,9.\n\nBut, with the dog information, perhaps we can determine which one is correct.\n\nBut, in both cases, there is an oldest daughter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dog is a red herring, and the house number corresponds to a unique sum.\n\nBut, in our earlier list, after elimination, each sum is unique.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is one of these combinations: 1,1,36; 1,2,18; 1,3,12; 1,4,9; 2,3,6.\n\nBut, among these, the combination 1,1,36 seems unlikely, as it would imply one daughter is 36 and the others are 1, which might be unusual.\n\nBut, perhaps it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to interpret the dog comment.\n\nWait, perhaps the dog comment is not to eliminate combinations but to indicate that there is an oldest daughter, which we've already used to eliminate combinations where all daughters are the same age.\n\nBut, in our remaining combinations, all have distinct ages except for 1,1,36, which we've already considered.\n\nWait, but in 1,1,36, there is an oldest daughter who is 36, and the others are 1 each.\n\nSo, that should be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is intended to indicate that the oldest daughter is not too old, or something like that.\n\nBut, that seems speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is meant to imply something about the ages, like dog years or something, but that seems far-fetched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is just to provide a characteristic of the oldest daughter, but doesn't directly affect the ages.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the house number is such that there are multiple possible age combinations summing to it, but the dog comment allows us to choose one over the other.\n\nBut, in our current list, each sum is unique.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is the combination with sum 13, which is 2,2,9, but we've eliminated that because of the oldest daughter issue.\n\nWait, but in 2,2,9, the oldest daughter is 9, and there are two daughters aged 2, so the oldest is unique.\n\nBut, in our earlier elimination, we eliminated combinations where there are two daughters of the same age, but in 2,2,9, there are two daughters aged 2, so perhaps that should be eliminated.\n\nWait, but in 2,2,9, the oldest daughter is 9, and she has a dog, but there are two daughters aged 2.\n\nSo, perhaps it's acceptable, because the oldest is unique.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the puzzle implies that among the daughters, there is only one oldest daughter.\n\nTherefore, combinations like 1,6,6 and 2,2,9 should be eliminated because there are two daughters of the same age, and hence no unique oldest daughter.\n\nWait, but in 2,2,9, the oldest daughter is 9, unique, and the other two are 2 each.\n\nSo, perhaps it should not be eliminated.\n\nSimilarly, in 1,6,6, the oldest daughter is 6, unique, and the other two are 1 each.\n\nSo, perhaps both 1,6,6 and 2,2,9 should not be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the house number is 13, and the dog comment is to distinguish between these two combinations.\n\nBut, in that case, I'm not sure how the dog comment helps to choose between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is intended to indicate that the oldest daughter is not the same age as the others, which would eliminate 1,6,6 and 2,2,9, but that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no, in 1,6,6, the oldest is 6, and the others are 1, so she is not the same age as the others.\n\nSimilarly, in 2,2,9, the oldest is 9, different from the others who are 2.\n\nSo, perhaps that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is intended to indicate that the oldest daughter is older than a certain age, but without more information, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is just to make the puzzle more interesting, and not directly relevant to the mathematical part.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is one of the remaining combinations: 1,2,18; 1,3,12; 1,4,9; 2,3,6; 3,3,4.\n\nBut, 3,3,4 has two daughters aged 3, so perhaps that should be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. 1,2,18 (sum=21)\n\n2. 1,3,12 (sum=16)\n\n3. 1,4,9 (sum=14)\n\n4. 2,3,6 (sum=11)\n\nNow, perhaps the house number is such that it corresponds to one of these sums.\n\nBut, without additional information, it's impossible to determine which one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a standard way to interpret these puzzles, and I'm missing it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the sum is ambiguous without the dog comment, and the dog comment resolves the ambiguity.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the house number is 13, which corresponds to both 1,6,6 and 2,2,9, but the dog comment indicates which one is correct.\n\nBut, in our earlier elimination, we've removed both of those.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider the elimination.\n\nIf the house number is 13, and the sum is 13, then the possible combinations are 1,6,6 and 2,2,9.\n\nBut, in both cases, there is an oldest daughter.\n\nIn 1,6,6, the oldest is 6, and in 2,2,9, the oldest is 9.\n\nSo, perhaps the dog comment is intended to indicate which one is correct.\n\nBut, I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is intended to indicate that there is only one oldest daughter, which is true in both cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is intended to indicate that the oldest daughter is not the same age as the others, which would eliminate 1,6,6 and 2,2,9, but that doesn't make sense because in both, the oldest is unique.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is intended to indicate that the oldest daughter is not twins, or something like that, but that seems excessive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the puzzle is intended to have multiple solutions, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the answer is 2,3,6, which sums to 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 3,3,4, but we've eliminated that because of the oldest daughter issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the house number is 13, and the dog comment is intended to choose between 1,6,6 and 2,2,9.\n\nBut, in that case, I don't see how to choose.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dog comment is intended to indicate that the oldest daughter is at least a certain age, but without more information, that's speculative.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the answer is 2,3,6, as it's a reasonable combination.\n\nTherefore, the ages of the daughters are 2, 3, and 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2, 3, 6} \\]"
