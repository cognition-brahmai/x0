        "content": "So I have this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden. The garden is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. They want me to build a fence around it with an additional 5 feet on each side. I need to find out what the perimeter of this fenced area will be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There's a garden that's rectangular, so it has two lengths and two widths. The lengths are 30 feet each, and the widths are 20 feet each. So, the garden itself has a perimeter, but I'm not asked for that. I'm asked for the perimeter of the area after adding a fence that's 5 feet away from the garden on each side.\n\nSo, this means that the fence is going to be built around the garden, but not right against it. There's going to be a 5-foot space between the garden and the fence all around.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If the garden is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, and I'm adding 5 feet on each side, that means the fence will be 5 feet outside the garden on all sides.\n\nSo, for the length, which is 30 feet, if I add 5 feet to one end and 5 feet to the other end, that's a total addition of 10 feet to the length. So, the total length of the fenced area would be 30 feet + 10 feet = 40 feet.\n\nSimilarly, for the width, which is 20 feet, adding 5 feet to one side and 5 feet to the other side adds 10 feet to the width. So, the total width of the fenced area would be 20 feet + 10 feet = 30 feet.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the fenced area, I need to add up all the sides. Since it's a rectangle, the perimeter P is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2 * (length + width)\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\nP = 2 * (40 feet + 30 feet) = 2 * 70 feet = 140 feet\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the fence being uniformly 5 feet away from the garden on all sides, which means that the fenced area is a larger rectangle that encompasses the garden with a uniform border of 5 feet.\n\nSo, in this case, the total length of the fenced area should be the length of the garden plus twice the border width, because the border is added on both sides.\n\nSimilarly, the total width of the fenced area should be the width of the garden plus twice the border width.\n\nSo, length of fenced area = 30 feet + 2 * 5 feet = 30 + 10 = 40 feet\n\nWidth of fenced area = 20 feet + 2 * 5 feet = 20 + 10 = 30 feet\n\nThen, perimeter P = 2 * (40 + 30) = 2 * 70 = 140 feet\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret \"additional 5 feet on each side.\"\n\nMaybe it means adding 5 feet to each side without doubling it. For example, adding 5 feet to one length and 5 feet to one width.\n\nBut no, that doesn't make sense because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, if I add 5 feet to one length, I need to add 5 feet to the opposite length as well. Similarly for the widths.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"additional 5 feet on each side.\" So, for each side of the garden, the fence is 5 feet away from it.\n\nSo, for the length sides, each is 30 feet, and adding 5 feet on each end, so that's 30 + 5 + 5 = 40 feet for each length side.\n\nFor the width sides, each is 20 feet, and adding 5 feet on each end, so that's 20 + 5 + 5 = 30 feet for each width side.\n\nSo, again, the fenced area is a rectangle that's 40 feet in length and 30 feet in width.\n\nPerimeter is still 2 * (40 + 30) = 140 feet.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it by considering the overall dimensions.\n\nOriginal garden: 30 feet by 20 feet.\n\nFence is 5 feet away from the garden on all sides.\n\nSo, the fenced area would be:\n\nLength: 30 + 2 * 5 = 40 feet\n\nWidth: 20 + 2 * 5 = 30 feet\n\nPerimeter: 2 * (40 + 30) = 140 feet\n\nYes, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
