        "content": "In the park, where the trees do arc,\nLived a pack of dogs with a knack to hark.\nTheir tails would twerk, and their tongues would lark,\nAs they played and explored, never feeling stark.\n\nOne dog, named Spark, had a coat like a lark,\nHis fur was bright, like a beam from a park.\nHe'd run and he'd prance, with a gleam in his dark,\nHis energy boundless, never feeling stark.\n\nAnother dog, Mark, was slow and stark,\nHis movements deliberate, not a quick bark.\nHe preferred to observe, and take his time to mark,\nThe scents and the sounds, without any hark.\n\nThen there was Dark, with eyes that sharked,\nHis gaze could penetrate, no need to embark.\nHe was the protector, always on guard, never to embark,\nHis presence a comfort, a silent embark.\n\nAnd lastly, there was Spark's counterpart, Stark,\nWho loved to lounge, in the sun's warm hark.\nHis days were spent, in relaxation's park,\nRarely barking, unless something was amiss, a stark.\n\nTogether, they roamed, through fields and park,\nTheir lives intertwined, in this canine hark.\nEach with their own charm, and their own particular dark,\nLiving life to the fullest, without any stark.\n\nSo here's to the dogs, with their unique lark,\nMay they continue to play, in their own special park.\nWith barks and with tails, they never feel stark,\nIn the world of dogs, where happiness never departs, a stark."
