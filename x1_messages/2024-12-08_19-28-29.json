        "content": "The popular board game you're referring to is Monopoly. It was first published by Parker Brothers in 1935. Boardwalk and Park Place are two of the most expensive properties in the game, both located on the Mediterranean Avenue side of the board. In Monopoly, players roll dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels with the goal of driving their opponents to bankruptcy. The game has been a staple of family game nights for generations and has seen numerous editions and variations over the years."
