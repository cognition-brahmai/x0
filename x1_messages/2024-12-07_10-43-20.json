        "content": "- **Ball Lightning:** This is a rare phenomenon where electricity appears in the form of a glowing ball. Its cause is still not fully understood, but theories include the combustion of silicon in soil, microwave radiation from thunderstorms, or even mini black holes.\n\n- **Sun Dogs:** Also known as parhelia, these are bright spots that appear on either side of the sun, often seen when the sun is near the horizon. They are caused by the refraction of light through ice crystals in the atmosphere.\n\n- **Fire Rainbows:** Technically known as circumhorizontal arcs, these are colorful, fire-like bands that appear to be on fire in the sky. They occur when sunlight passes through high-altitude cirrus clouds containing plate-shaped ice crystals, which refract the light into a spectrum.\n\n- **Frost Quakes:** Scientifically known as cryoseisms, these are sudden, loud noises caused by the rapid freezing of ground moisture. As water freezes and expands, it can crack the ground or frozen layers, producing sounds similar to thunder or gunshots."
