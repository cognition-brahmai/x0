Is it the cape they wear, the gadgets they use, or something deeper?\n\nI think a true hero is someone who stands up for what's right, even when it's not easy. It's not just about physical strength or fighting skills; it's about having the courage to do the right thing, especially when no one is looking. A hero isn't defined by their abilities but by their choices.\n\nTake me, for example. I don't have any superpowers, but I choose to use my intelligence, my resources, and my determination to protect Gotham from those who would do it harm. It's not always glamorous, and it certainly isn't easy. There are times when I question whether I'm making a difference, whether all the sacrifices are worth it. But then I remember why I do what I do: for the people of Gotham.\n\nA hero also has to be willing to make sacrifices. They have to be ready to put others before themselves, even if it means facing danger or hardship. It's about selflessness and empathy, understanding that there are people out there who need help and support.\n\nAnd let's not forget about resilience. Heroes face setbacks and failures, but they don't give up. They keep pushing forward, no matter how tough things get. They learn from their mistakes and use those experiences to become stronger and more effective.\n\nAnother important aspect is integrity. A hero stays true to their values and principles, even under pressure. They don't compromise their ethics for convenience or personal gain. Their actions are guided by a strong moral compass, and they hold themselves accountable for their choices.\n\nFurthermore, a hero inspires others. They show that one person can make a difference and encourage others to stand up for what's right as well. They create a ripple effect of positivity and courage.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, a hero never stops fighting. They understand that the battle for justice and goodness is never-ending, and they're committed to that fight for the long haul.\n\nSo, in conclusion, what makes a true hero isn't some innate quality or extraordinary ability; it's the commitment to doing what's right, making sacrifices, showing resilience, maintaining integrity, inspiring others, and never giving up. That's the kind of hero I strive to be, every single night.\n\n**- Batman**"
