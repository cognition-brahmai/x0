        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges $25 per day and 15 cents per mile. The customer rents the car for 5 days and drives 300 miles. So, I need to calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, the daily rental cost: $25 per day for 5 days. That should be $25 multiplied by 5.\n\n$25 * 5 = $125.\n\nNext, the mileage cost: 15 cents per mile for 300 miles. First, I need to convert 15 cents to dollars because the daily rate is in dollars. 15 cents is $0.15.\n\nSo, $0.15 per mile for 300 miles: $0.15 * 300.\n\n$0.15 * 300 = $45.\n\nNow, I add the daily rental cost and the mileage cost to get the total charge.\n\n$125 + $45 = $170.\n\nTherefore, the total amount the customer will be charged is $170.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{170} \\]"
