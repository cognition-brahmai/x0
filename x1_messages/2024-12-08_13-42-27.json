        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The length is 60 feet and the width is 40 feet. I need to find out two things: the area of the garden and how much fencing is needed to enclose it completely.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the area. I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, for this garden, the area should be 60 feet times 40 feet. Let me do the math:\n\n60 feet * 40 feet = 2400 square feet.\n\nSo, the area of the garden is 2400 square feet.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how much fencing is needed to enclose the garden completely. That means I need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides, or more efficiently, by using the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width).\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (60 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * (100 feet) = 200 feet.\n\nTherefore, 200 feet of fencing is needed to enclose the garden completely.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the area, 60 times 40 is indeed 2400 square feet. That seems correct. For the perimeter, 60 plus 40 is 100, and multiplied by 2 is 200 feet. That also seems right.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can visualize this. Imagine a rectangle that is longer than it is wide, with the longer sides being 60 feet each and the shorter sides being 40 feet each. The area is the space inside this rectangle, which is 2400 square feet, and the perimeter is the total length around the outside, which is 200 feet.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident with these answers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the garden is \\boxed{2400} square feet, and the amount of fencing needed is \\boxed{200} feet."
