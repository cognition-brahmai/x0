        "content": "Alright, I'm going to write a Go program that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria. The program should take command-line arguments to specify the password length and whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Then, it should generate a specified number of passwords according to these criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the requirements clearly:\n\n1. **Command-line arguments**: The program should accept options for:\n\n- Password length.\n\n- Whether to include uppercase letters.\n\n- Whether to include lowercase letters.\n\n- Whether to include numbers.\n\n- Whether to include special characters.\n\n- The number of passwords to generate.\n\n2. **Password generation**: Based on the criteria provided, generate passwords that meet the specified requirements.\n\n3. **Edge cases**: Handle cases where no character types are selected or the password length is too short.\n\nI need to plan how to structure the program. Here's a rough outline:\n\n- Use the `flag` package to handle command-line arguments.\n\n- Define boolean flags for including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.\n\n- Define an integer flag for password length and another for the number of passwords to generate.\n\n- Validate that at least one character type is selected.\n\n- Create a function to generate a single password based on the criteria.\n\n- Use a loop to generate the specified number of passwords.\n\nLet's think about the character sets:\n\n- Uppercase letters: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n\n- Lowercase letters: \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\n- Numbers: \"0123456789\"\n\n- Special characters: \"!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:',.<>?/\"\n\nI need to concatenate the selected character sets and ensure that the password includes at least one character from each selected set.\n\nAlso, I should consider using a cryptographically secure random source for generating passwords.\n\nIn Go, I can use the `math/rand` package combined with `crypto/rand` for better randomness.\n\nWait, actually, for cryptographic purposes, it's recommended to use `crypto/rand`. But for password generation, while it's good to have high-quality randomness, `math/rand` seeded properly should suffice for most non-cryptographic purposes. However, to be safe, I'll use `crypto/rand`.\n\nNow, let's think about how to ensure that each required character type is included in the password.\n\nOne way is:\n\n- If a character type is required, pick at least one character from that type.\n\n- Then fill the remaining password length with random characters from the combined character set.\n\nThis ensures that each required type is present.\n\nI need to handle the case where the password length is less than the number of required character types. In such cases, the program should return an error indicating that the password length is too short.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the password generation function:\n\n1. Check if the password length is sufficient to include at least one of each required character type.\n\n2. Collect all allowed character sets based on the flags.\n\n3. Concatenate the allowed character sets to form the total character pool.\n\n4. If any character types are mandatory, pick one character from each mandatory set and add them to the password.\n\n5. Fill the remaining password length with random characters from the total character pool.\n\n6. Shuffle the password to ensure the mandatory characters are randomly placed.\n\nNow, for the command-line flags, I need to define them properly.\n\nI should also provide some default values or make some flags mandatory.\n\nPerhaps make the password length and the number of passwords to generate required, and make the character type flags optional with default values of true.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to make all character type flags default to true, meaning that if the user doesn't specify otherwise, all character types are included.\n\nBut I need to think about usability. Maybe provide a way for the user to exclude certain character types if they wish.\n\nAlso, consider adding a help flag to explain how to use the program.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the password generation function.\n\nI need a function that takes the length and the allowed character sets, and returns a random password string.\n\nI'll need a way to pick random characters from the character sets.\n\nUsing `crypto/rand`, I can read random bytes and map them to indices in the character set string.\n\nBut I need to handle the case where the number of possible characters is not a power of two to avoid bias in selection.\n\nWait, actually, Go's `crypto/rand` package provides a `Read` function that reads random bytes into a byte slice.\n\nFor generating random indices, I can read random bytes and convert them to integers, then take the modulus of the length of the character set.\n\nBut I need to be careful to handle the modulus bias.\n\nTo avoid modulus bias, I should discard values that are greater than or equal to the largest multiple of the character set length that is less than or equal to the maximum value of the random integer.\n\nIn practice, for a character set of length n and a random byte range of 0 to 255, if 256 is not a multiple of n, some indices will be more likely than others.\n\nTo avoid this, I can restrict the random byte values to a range that is a multiple of n.\n\nFor example, if n=10, I can use random bytes from 0 to 250 (since 250 is divisible by 10), and map them to indices 0 to 9.\n\nThen, 250 / 10 = 25, so each index has an equal chance.\n\nBut in Go, it's easier to use the `io.LimitReader` with `rand.Reader` to read the required number of bytes.\n\nAlternatively, I can use `crypto/rand.Intn` if available, but I think `crypto/rand` doesn't have an `Intn` function.\n\nWait, `crypto/rand` has a `Read` function, so I need to implement the modulo operation carefully to avoid bias.\n\nPerhaps it's simpler to use `math/rand` with a seed from `crypto/rand`.\n\nBut for better security, I'll stick with `crypto/rand`.\n\nLet me look up how to get a random integer within a range using `crypto/rand`.\n\nI can read random bytes and convert them to an integer, then take modulo the length of the character set.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the integer is within a range that is a multiple of the character set length to avoid bias.\n\nHere's an example from the Go crypto/rand documentation:\n\nTo read a random integer in the range [0, n):\n\n```\n\nimport (\n\n\t\"crypto/rand\"\n\n\t\"io\"\n\n\tmath/big\"\n\n)\n\nfunc Intn(n int) (int, error) {\n\n\tif n < 0 {\n\n\t\treturn 0, errors.New(\"negative argument to Intn\")\n\n\t}\n\n\t// Special case for n == 0, to produce 0 unconditionally.\n\n\tif n == 0 {\n\n\t\treturn 0, nil\n\n\t}\n\n\t// Read random bytes until we get one in [0, n).\n\n\tmax := big.NewInt(int64(n))\n\n\tvar bits uint\n\n\tvar x big.Int\n\n\tfor {\n\n\t\tvar buf [8]byte\n\n\t\t_, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, buf[:])\n\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\n\t\t\treturn 0, err\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tx.SetBytes(buf[:])\n\n\t\tif x.Cmp(max) < 0 {\n\n\t\t\treturn int(x.Int64()), nil\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tbits += 64\n\n\t}\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis function reads random bytes and converts them to a big.Int, then checks if it's less than n.\n\nIf it is, returns that value; otherwise, repeats the process.\n\nThis avoids modulo bias.\n\nI can use this function to generate random indices for selecting characters from the character set.\n\nNow, back to the password generation function.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\n- Collect all allowed characters in a string.\n\n- If mandatory character types are specified, pick one character from each mandatory set and add them to the password.\n\n- Generate the remaining characters randomly from the entire allowed set.\n\n- Shuffle the password to randomize the order of the mandatory characters.\n\nI need to implement a function to shuffle the string.\n\nIn Go, strings are immutable, so I'll need to convert the string to a byte slice, shuffle it, and then convert it back to a string.\n\nFor shuffling, I can use the Fisher-Yates algorithm.\n\nI need to implement this algorithm using `crypto/rand` for shuffling.\n\nNow, considering that `crypto/rand` is a cryptographically secure random source, it might be overkill for shuffling, but for consistency, I'll use it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use `math/rand` for shuffling with a seed from `crypto/rand`.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll use `math/rand` with a seed from `crypto/rand`.\n\nWait, no. For security reasons, it's better to use `crypto/rand` for all random operations in this program.\n\nSo, I'll implement the shuffling using `crypto/rand`.\n\nNow, let's think about how to handle the command-line flags.\n\nI need to define flags for:\n\n- Length: integer, required.\n\n- Uppercase: boolean, default true.\n\n- Lowercase: boolean, default true.\n\n- Numbers: boolean, default true.\n\n- Special characters: boolean, default true.\n\n- Count: integer, number of passwords to generate, default 1.\n\nI need to parse these flags and use their values to generate the passwords.\n\nAlso, I should validate that at least one character type is selected.\n\nIf none are selected, return an error.\n\nSimilarly, check that the length is sufficient to include at least one of each mandatory character type.\n\nNow, let's consider how to structure the program.\n\nI can define constants for the character sets:\n\n- Uppercase letters: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n\n- Lowercase letters: \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\n- Numbers: \"0123456789\"\n\n- Special characters: \"!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:',.<>?/\"\n\nThen, based on the flags, concatenate the required character sets.\n\nI need to keep track of which character types are mandatory.\n\nWait, actually, in this program, all selected character types are mandatory, meaning that if a user selects to include uppercase letters, the password must contain at least one uppercase letter.\n\nIs that the requirement?\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each selected character type, pick at least one character from that type.\n\nThen fill the remaining password length with random characters from the combined character set.\n\nAfter that, shuffle the password to randomize the order.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the password generation function.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\nfunc generatePassword(length int, charSets map[string]string) (string, error) {\n\n// Validate that at least one character set is selected.\n\nif len(charSets) == 0 {\n\nreturn \"\", errors.New(\"at least one character set must be selected\")\n\n}\n\n// Collect all characters from selected sets.\n\nvar allChars strings.Builder\n\nfor _, set := range charSets {\n\nallChars.WriteString(set)\n\n}\n\ncharPool := allChars.String()\n\n// Pick at least one character from each selected set.\n\nvar mandatoryChars strings.Builder\n\nfor _, set := range charSets {\n\nchar := selectRandomChar(set)\n\nmandatoryChars.WriteByte(char)\n\n}\n\n// Calculate remaining length.\n\nremainingLength := length - mandatoryChars.Len()\n\nif remainingLength < 0 {\n\nreturn \"\", errors.New(\"password length is too short for the selected character sets\")\n\n}\n\n// Generate remaining characters randomly from the combined character pool.\n\nvar password strings.Builder\n\npassword.WriteString(mandatoryChars.String())\n\nfor i := 0; i < remainingLength; i++ {\n\nchar := selectRandomChar(charPool)\n\npassword.WriteByte(char)\n\n}\n\n// Shuffle the password.\n\npwdBytes := []byte(password.String())\n\nshuffleBytes(pwdBytes)\n\nreturn string(pwdBytes), nil\n\n}\n\nI need to implement selectRandomChar and shuffleBytes functions using `crypto/rand`.\n\nFor selectRandomChar, I can pick a random index from 0 to len(set)-1.\n\nFor shuffleBytes, I can implement the Fisher-Yates shuffle using `crypto/rand`.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement selectRandomChar.\n\nI can write a function that takes a string and returns a random character from it.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\nfunc selectRandomChar(set string) byte {\n\nn := len(set)\n\nindex, err := randomIntn(n)\n\nif err != nil {\n\npanic(err) // or handle error appropriately\n\n}\n\nreturn set[index]\n\n}\n\nI need to implement randomIntn using `crypto/rand`, similar to the example I found earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for shuffleBytes, I can implement the Fisher-Yates shuffle:\n\nfunc shuffleBytes(bytes []byte) error {\n\nn := len(bytes)\n\nfor i := n - 1; i > 0; i-- {\n\nj, err := randomIntn(i + 1)\n\nif err != nil {\n\nreturn err\n\n}\n\nbytes[i], bytes[j] = bytes[j], bytes[i]\n\n}\n\nreturn nil\n\n}\n\nAgain, randomIntn is used here.\n\nNow, I need to implement randomIntn using `crypto/rand`.\n\nI can define a function randomIntn that takes an upper limit n and returns a random integer in the range [0, n).\n\nI'll need to handle the modulus bias as explained earlier.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\nfunc randomIntn(n int) (int, error) {\n\nif n <= 0 {\n\nreturn 0, errors.New(\"n must be positive\")\n\n}\n\n// Read random bytes until we get a value in [0, n)\n\nvar x big.Int\n\nfor {\n\n\tbuf := make([]byte, 8) // 8 bytes for uint64\n\n\t_, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, buf)\n\n\tif err != nil {\n\n\t\treturn 0, err\n\n\t}\n\n\tx.SetBytes(buf)\n\n\tif x.Cmp(big.NewInt(int64(n))) < 0 {\n\n\t\treturn int(x.Int64()), nil\n\n\t}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis function reads random bytes until the generated number is within the range [0, n).\n\nThis avoids modulo bias.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all selected character sets are included in the password.\n\nIn the generatePassword function, I'm picking at least one character from each selected set and then filling the remaining length with random characters from the combined set.\n\nAfter that, I shuffle the password to randomize the order.\n\nThis should ensure that each mandatory character type is present in the password.\n\nI also need to handle the case where the password length is shorter than the number of mandatory character types.\n\nIn such cases, it's impossible to include all mandatory characters, so I should return an error.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the main function.\n\nI need to parse the command-line flags, validate the inputs, and then generate the specified number of passwords.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\nfunc main() {\n\n// Define flags\n\nlength := flag.Int(\"length\", 0, \"password length\")\n\nuppercase := flag.Bool(\"uppercase\", true, \"include uppercase letters\")\n\nlowercase := flag.Bool(\"lowercase\", true, \"include lowercase letters\")\n\nnumbers := flag.Bool(\"numbers\", true, \"include numbers\")\n\nspecial := flag.Bool(\"special\", true, \"include special characters\")\n\ncount := flag.Int(\"count\", 1, \"number of passwords to generate\")\n\n// Parse flags\n\nflag.Parse()\n\n// Collect selected character sets\n\ncharSets := make(map[string]string)\n\nif *uppercase {\n\ncharSets[\"uppercase\"] = uppercaseLetters\n\n}\n\nif *lowercase {\n\ncharSets[\"lowercase\"] = lowercaseLetters\n\n}\n\nif *numbers {\n\ncharSets[\"numbers\"] = numbersSet\n\n}\n\nif *special {\n\ncharSets[\"special\"] = specialChars\n\n}\n\n// Validate that at least one character set is selected\n\nif len(charSets) == 0 {\n\nfmt.Println(\"Error: at least one character set must be selected\")\n\nos.Exit(1)\n\n}\n\n// Validate password length\n\nif *length < len(charSets) {\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Error: password length must be at least %d for the selected character sets\\n\", len(charSets))\n\nos.Exit(1)\n\n}\n\n// Generate and print passwords\n\nfor i := 0; i < *count; i++ {\n\npwd, err := generatePassword(*length, charSets)\n\nif err != nil {\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Error generating password: %v\\n\", err)\n\nos.Exit(1)\n\n}\n\nfmt.Println(pwd)\n\n}\n\n}\n\nI need to define the character set constants:\n\nconst (\n\nuppercaseLetters = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n\nlowercaseLetters = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\nnumbersSet = \"0123456789\"\n\nspecialChars = \"!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:',.<>?/\"\n\n)\n\nNow, let's think about how to make the program more user-friendly.\n\nI can add a help flag to explain how to use the program.\n\nAlso, I can provide a default password length, say 12 characters, if not specified.\n\nBut in the initial sketch, I set the password length flag with no default value, meaning it's required.\n\nI need to decide whether to make it required or provide a default.\n\nMaking it required ensures that the user specifies the length, but it might be convenient to have a default.\n\nI'll set a default length of 12 characters.\n\nSimilarly, set the character type flags to default to true.\n\nAlso, set the count flag to default to 1.\n\nNow, let's think about how to test the program.\n\nI need to test different combinations of flags and ensure that the generated passwords meet the specified criteria.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Generate a password with all character types included.\n\n- Generate a password with only lowercase letters.\n\n- Generate a password with lowercase and numbers.\n\n- Generate multiple passwords at once.\n\n- Test edge cases, such as minimum password length.\n\nI should also ensure that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully, such as negative length or invalid flags.\n\nNow, let's consider writing some test cases.\n\nBut since this is a command-line program, writing automated tests might be a bit involved.\n\nI can write some manual test cases for now.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Generate a single password with default settings:\n\n$ go run main.go -length=12\n\nExpected: a 12-character password including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.\n\n2. Generate a password with only lowercase letters:\n\n$ go run main.go -length=8 -uppercase=false -lowercase=true -numbers=false -special=false\n\nExpected: an 8-character password consisting only of lowercase letters.\n\n3. Generate 5 passwords with specific criteria:\n\n$ go run main.go -length=10 -uppercase=true -lowercase=true -numbers=true -special=false -count=5\n\nExpected: five 10-character passwords consisting of uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.\n\n4. Generate a password with insufficient length:\n\n$ go run main.go -length=3 -uppercase=true -lowercase=true -numbers=true -special=true\n\nExpected: an error indicating that the password length is too short for the selected character sets.\n\nI need to ensure that the program correctly handles these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the randomIntn function.\n\nI can define it as a separate function, as sketched earlier.\n\nBut I need to make sure that it's efficient and doesn't loop indefinitely.\n\nIn practice, for small n, the loop should terminate quickly.\n\nNow, considering that the character sets could be quite small, especially if only one or two types are selected, I need to ensure that the random selection is still secure and unbiased.\n\nAlso, I need to handle cases where the character set is empty, but in my implementation, I validate that at least one character set is selected, so this shouldn't happen.\n\nNow, let's think about how to handle special characters.\n\nSome special characters might have special meanings in certain contexts, like in shell commands.\n\nTo avoid issues, I can wrap the generated passwords in quotes when printing them.\n\nBut since I'm just printing them to the console, and assuming the user will handle them appropriately, this might not be necessary.\n\nHowever, to be safe, I can print them enclosed in quotes.\n\nWait, no, that might not be necessary. But I should consider if the password contains characters that could be interpreted by the shell, especially if the user copies and pastes the password.\n\nBut since it's printed to the console, as long as the user handles it properly, it should be fine.\n\nNow, let's think about localizing the program.\n\nSince passwords are universal, and the character sets are standard ASCII, localization shouldn't be an issue.\n\nI can assume that the program will be used in an English-speaking environment.\n\nNow, let's consider adding more features, like excluding ambiguous characters to avoid confusion.\n\nFor example, excluding characters like 'l' (lowercase L), 'I' (uppercase i), '1' (one), 'O' (uppercase o), and '0' (zero).\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it simple and include all the specified character sets.\n\nIf needed, I can add an option to exclude ambiguous characters in the future.\n\nNow, I need to implement the program step by step.\n\nFirst, set up the command-line flags.\n\nDefine the character set constants.\n\nImplement the generatePassword function.\n\nImplement the selectRandomChar and shuffleBytes functions using crypto/rand.\n\nImplement the randomIntn function to avoid modulo bias.\n\nFinally, in the main function, parse the flags, validate the inputs, and generate the specified number of passwords.\n\nI should also handle any errors that occur during password generation and provide meaningful error messages to the user.\n\nNow, let's start writing the code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Go program that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, follow the steps below. This program uses command-line arguments to determine the password characteristics such as length and character types included.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Command-line Arguments**: Use the `flag` package to handle command-line options for password length, inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and the number of passwords to generate.\n2. **Character Sets**: Define constants for different character types and concatenate them based on user-selected options.\n3. **Password Generation**: Ensure that each generated password includes at least one character from each selected character type. Fill the remaining password length with random characters from the combined set and shuffle the password to randomize the order.\n4. **Randomness**: Use `crypto/rand` for secure random number generation to avoid biases.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io\"\n\t\"math/big\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\n\t\"crypto/rand\"\n\t\"encoding/big\"\n)\n\nconst (\n\tuppercaseLetters = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n\tlowercaseLetters = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\tnumbersSet       = \"0123456789\"\n\tspecialChars     = \"!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:',.<>?/\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Define flags\n\tlength := flag.Int(\"length\", 12, \"password length\")\n\tuppercase := flag.Bool(\"uppercase\", true, \"include uppercase letters\")\n\tlowercase := flag.Bool(\"lowercase\", true, \"include lowercase letters\")\n\tnumbers := flag.Bool(\"numbers\", true, \"include numbers\")\n\tspecial := flag.Bool(\"special\", true, \"include special characters\")\n\tcount := flag.Int(\"count\", 1, \"number of passwords to generate\")\n\n\t// Parse flags\n\tflag.Parse()\n\n\t// Collect selected character sets\n\tcharSets := make(map[string]string)\n\tif *uppercase {\n\t\tcharSets[\"uppercase\"] = uppercaseLetters\n\t}\n\tif *lowercase {\n\t\tcharSets[\"lowercase\"] = lowercaseLetters\n\t}\n\tif *numbers {\n\t\tcharSets[\"numbers\"] = numbersSet\n\t}\n\tif *special {\n\t\tcharSets[\"special\"] = specialChars\n\t}\n\n\t// Validate that at least one character set is selected\n\tif len(charSets) == 0 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error: at least one character set must be selected\")\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// Validate password length\n\tif *length < len(charSets) {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Error: password length must be at least %d for the selected character sets\\n\", len(charSets))\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// Generate and print passwords\n\tfor i := 0; i < *count; i++ {\n\t\tpwd, err := generatePassword(*length, charSets)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Error generating password: %v\\n\", err)\n\t\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t\t}\n\t\tfmt.Println(pwd)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc generatePassword(length int, charSets map[string]string) (string, error) {\n\t// Collect all characters from selected sets\n\tvar allChars strings.Builder\n\tfor _, set := range charSets {\n\t\tallChars.WriteString(set)\n\t}\n\tcharPool := allChars.String()\n\n\t// Pick at least one character from each selected set\n\tvar mandatoryChars strings.Builder\n\tfor _, set := range charSets {\n\t\tchar := selectRandomChar(set)\n\t\tmandatoryChars.WriteByte(char)\n\t}\n\n\t// Calculate remaining length\n\tremainingLength := length - mandatoryChars.Len()\n\tif remainingLength < 0 {\n\t\treturn \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"password length is too short for the selected character sets\")\n\t}\n\n\t// Generate remaining characters randomly from the combined character pool\n\tvar password strings.Builder\n\tpassword.WriteString(mandatoryChars.String())\n\tfor i := 0; i < remainingLength; i++ {\n\t\tchar := selectRandomChar(charPool)\n\t\tpassword.WriteByte(char)\n\t}\n\n\t// Shuffle the password\n\tpwdBytes := []byte(password.String())\n\tif err := shuffleBytes(pwdBytes); err != nil {\n\t\treturn \"\", err\n\t}\n\n\treturn string(pwdBytes), nil\n}\n\nfunc selectRandomChar(set string) byte {\n\tn := len(set)\n\tindex, err := randomIntn(n)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err) // This should never happen\n\t}\n\treturn set[index]\n}\n\nfunc shuffleBytes(bytes []byte) error {\n\tn := len(bytes)\n\tfor i := n - 1; i > 0; i-- {\n\t\tj, err := randomIntn(i + 1)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn err\n\t\t}\n\t\tbytes[i], bytes[j] = bytes[j], bytes[i]\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nfunc randomIntn(n int) (int, error) {\n\tif n <= 0 {\n\t\treturn 0, fmt.Errorf(\"n must be positive\")\n\t}\n\t// Read random bytes until we get a value in [0, n)\n\tvar x big.Int\n\tfor {\n\t\tbuf := make([]byte, 8) // 8 bytes for uint64\n\t\t_, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, buf)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn 0, err\n\t\t}\n\t\tx.SetBytes(buf)\n\t\tif x.Cmp(big.NewInt(int64(n))) < 0 {\n\t\t\treturn int(x.Int64()), nil\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Flags Definition and Parsing**: The program uses the `flag` package to define and parse command-line options for password length, character set inclusions, and the number of passwords to generate.\n2. **Character Set Handling**: Based on user selections, the relevant character sets are collected and validated to ensure at least one set is chosen.\n3. **Password Generation**:\n   - At least one character from each selected character set is included.\n   - The remaining characters are filled randomly from the combined character sets.\n   - The password is shuffled to ensure randomness.\n4. **Secure Randomness**: The `crypto/rand` package is used for all random operations to ensure security and avoid biases.\n\nThis approach ensures that the generated passwords meet the specified criteria and are securely generated."
