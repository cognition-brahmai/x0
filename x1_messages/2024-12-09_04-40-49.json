        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 30 students in a class. Out of these, 18 play soccer, and 12 play basketball. There are also 5 students who don't play either sport. I need to find out how many students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nAlright, let's see. I think this is a problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That's where you add the number of students who play soccer and the number who play basketball, but since some students might play both, you've got to subtract those who are counted in both groups to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, the formula for the total number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\nNumber who play soccer + Number who play basketball - Number who play both.\n\nBut wait, there are also students who don't play any sport. The total number of students is 30, and 5 don't play any sport. That means that 30 - 5 = 25 students play at least one sport.\n\nSo, according to the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nNumber who play soccer + Number who play basketball - Number who play both = Number who play at least one sport.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n18 (soccer) + 12 (basketball) - both = 25.\n\nSo, 18 + 12 is 30, minus the number who play both equals 25.\n\nTherefore, 30 - both = 25.\n\nSo, the number who play both sports is 30 - 25 = 5.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nTotal students = 30\n\nStudents who don't play any sport = 5\n\nStudents who play at least one sport = 30 - 5 = 25\n\nStudents who play soccer = 18\n\nStudents who play basketball = 12\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nsoccer + basketball - both = at least one sport\n\n18 + 12 - both = 25\n\n30 - both = 25\n\nBoth = 30 - 25 = 5\n\nSo, 5 students play both soccer and basketball.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nMaybe using a Venn diagram. If I draw two circles overlapping, one for soccer and one for basketball.\n\nThe total number in the soccer circle is 18, in the basketball circle is 12, and the overlap is the number who play both, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nThe total number of students who play at least one sport is 25, as we calculated earlier.\n\nSo, if I add the number in the soccer circle and the basketball circle and subtract the overlap, I should get the total number who play at least one sport.\n\nAgain, that's 18 + 12 - both = 25\n\nSo, both = 5\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use set theory notation.\n\nLet S be the set of students who play soccer, and B be the set of students who play basketball.\n\nWe know that |S| = 18, |B| = 12, and the total number of students who play at least one sport is 25.\n\nWe need to find |S \u2229 B|.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n|S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B|\n\nWe know |S \u222a B| = 25\n\nSo, 25 = 18 + 12 - |S \u2229 B|\n\nTherefore, |S \u2229 B| = 18 + 12 - 25 = 5\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal students: 30\n\nStudents who play neither: 5\n\nSo, students who play at least one sport: 25\n\nIf 18 play soccer and 12 play basketball, that's a total of 30, but since some students play both, we need to subtract those who are counted in both to get the total number who play at least one sport.\n\nSo, both = 30 - 25 = 5\n\nAlternatively, if 18 play soccer and 5 of those also play basketball, then the number who play only soccer is 18 - 5 = 13\n\nSimilarly, the number who play only basketball is 12 - 5 = 7\n\nSo, total students who play at least one sport: 13 (only soccer) + 7 (only basketball) + 5 (both) = 25\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play both soccer and basketball is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
