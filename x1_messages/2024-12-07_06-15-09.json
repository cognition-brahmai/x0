        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A farmer has a rectangular field that's 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide this field into square plots of equal size without leaving any leftover space. I need to figure out what the largest possible size for each square plot is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to divide the field into square plots without leaving any space. That means that each square plot should fit perfectly inside the rectangle, covering the entire area without overlapping or leaving any gaps.\n\nSince the plots are square, both the length and the width of the field must be divisible by the side length of the square plot. So, if I let the side length of the square plot be 's' meters, then 's' must be a divisor of both 120 and 80.\n\nTo find the largest possible 's', I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 120 and 80. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both.\n\nFirst, I'll list the divisors of 120.\n\n120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nNow, the divisors of 80.\n\n80: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, 80.\n\nLooking at both lists, the common divisors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nThe largest of these is 40.\n\nSo, the largest possible size for each square plot is 40 meters on each side.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I use 40 meters as the side length, then the number of square plots along the length would be 120 divided by 40, which is 3, and along the width, 80 divided by 40, which is 2. So, overall, it would be 3 times 2, which is 6 square plots, each of 40 meters by 40 meters, covering the entire 120 by 80 meter field without any leftover space.\n\nThat seems correct. But is there a better way to find the GCD besides listing all the divisors? I think there is a more efficient method, especially for larger numbers.\n\nI recall that the Euclidean algorithm is an efficient way to compute the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\nSo, to find GCD(120, 80), I can follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide 120 by 80 and find the remainder.\n\n120 divided by 80 is 1, with a remainder of 40.\n\n2. Then, replace 120 with 80 and 80 with the remainder, 40, and repeat the process.\n\nSo, GCD(80, 40).\n\n3. Divide 80 by 40, which is 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. When the remainder is 0, the GCD is the divisor at that step, which is 40.\n\nSo, using the Euclidean algorithm, I again get 40 as the GCD.\n\nThis confirms my earlier result.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if 40 is indeed the largest possible side length for the square plots.\n\nIf I choose a larger size, say 45 meters, then 120 divided by 45 is approximately 2.666, which is not an integer. That means there would be leftover space, which contradicts the requirement of no leftover space.\n\nSimilarly, 50 meters: 120 / 50 = 2.4, which again is not an integer.\n\nOn the other hand, smaller sizes like 20 meters would work, but it's not the largest possible since 40 is larger and also works.\n\nTherefore, 40 meters is indeed the largest possible size for the square plots.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the problem in terms of the least common multiple (LCM) or other number properties, but I think the GCD approach is the most straightforward for this scenario.\n\nJust to explore a bit more, suppose the field had different dimensions, say a length and width that were co-prime, meaning their GCD is 1. In that case, the largest possible square plot would be 1 meter by 1 meter.\n\nBut in this specific problem, since the GCD is 40, 40 meters is the answer.\n\nI should also consider if there's any constraint on the number of plots or other factors, but based on the problem statement, it's solely about dividing the field into equal square plots without leftovers, and finding the largest possible size.\n\nSo, I think 40 meters is the correct and final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
