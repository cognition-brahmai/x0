        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 houses in the village, and each house has one cat. Each cat catches one mouse from every other house except its own every day. I need to find out how many mice the cats catch in total each day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many mice each cat catches. Since there are 10 houses, and each cat doesn't catch mice from its own house, that means each cat catches mice from 9 other houses. So, each cat catches 9 mice per day.\n\nNow, there are 10 cats, and each catches 9 mice. So, if I multiply 10 by 9, that would give me the total number of mice caught, right? Let's do that: 10 times 9 is 90.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I should double-check. Perhaps there's something I'm missing here.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's consider the mice. Each house has cats from other houses catching mice from it. Since there are 10 houses, and each house has mice that are caught by 9 cats (from the other 9 houses), then each house contributes 9 mice per day.\n\nSo, with 10 houses, each contributing 9 mice, the total would again be 10 times 9, which is 90.\n\nHmm, that matches my first calculation. Maybe it is indeed 90.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as a complete graph where each cat is connected to every other house except its own. So, each cat has connections to 9 other houses, and there are 10 cats, leading to 10 times 9, or 90 connections, each representing one mouse caught.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the total number of mice caught by all the cats each day is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
