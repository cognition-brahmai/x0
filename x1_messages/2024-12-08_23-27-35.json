        "content": "So if a restaurant serves 120 customers every hour and it's open for 8 hours each day, I need to find out how many customers they serve in a whole week. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many customers are served in one day. Since they serve 120 customers per hour and are open for 8 hours, I can multiply 120 by 8 to get the daily total.\n\n120 customers/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day = 960 customers/day\n\nSo, they serve 960 customers each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly total, I need to multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:\n\n960 customers/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 6,720 customers/week\n\nTherefore, the restaurant serves 6,720 customers in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way could be to find out the total number of hours the restaurant is open in a week and then multiply that by the number of customers served per hour.\n\nSo, the restaurant is open 8 hours each day for 7 days, so:\n\n8 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 56 hours/week\n\nAnd they serve 120 customers per hour, so:\n\n120 customers/hour \u00d7 56 hours/week = 6,720 customers/week\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, I'm confident that 6,720 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, does the restaurant operate the same number of hours every day? The problem says \"assume the restaurant operates for 8 hours each day,\" so I think it's safe to assume that it's consistent every day of the week.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention any holidays or special events that might affect the number of customers. So, I can proceed with the given information.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the customer arrival rate is constant throughout the day. The problem states that they serve 120 customers per hour, so I'll assume that this rate is uniform.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the restaurant has different customer volumes at different times of the day, but again, since the problem gives a constant rate, I'll stick with that.\n\nLet me also consider if there's a better way to express this calculation. Maybe using dimensional analysis to ensure that the units cancel out correctly.\n\nStarting with customers per hour:\n\n120 customers/hour\n\nThen, hours per day:\n\n8 hours/day\n\nSo, customers per day = (120 customers/hour) \u00d7 (8 hours/day) = 960 customers/day\n\nThen, days per week:\n\n7 days/week\n\nSo, customers per week = (960 customers/day) \u00d7 (7 days/week) = 6,720 customers/week\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, as I did earlier, total hours per week:\n\n8 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 56 hours/week\n\nThen, customers per week = 120 customers/hour \u00d7 56 hours/week = 6,720 customers/week\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that the restaurant serves 6,720 customers in a week.\n\nBut to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me think about real-world scenarios. Maybe sometimes restaurants have peak hours where they serve more customers or slow hours with fewer customers. However, since the problem gives an average of 120 customers per hour, I think using this average is appropriate for the calculation.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the restaurant has any limits to the number of customers they can serve per hour. For example, if the restaurant has a limited seating capacity, they might not be able to serve more customers even if they arrive. But again, based on the information provided, they serve 120 customers per hour, so I'll assume that's the consistent rate.\n\nAnother angle to consider: if the restaurant is open for 8 hours each day, are there any breaks or closing times within those 8 hours? The problem doesn't specify any, so I'll assume that the 8 hours are continuous operating hours.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the restaurant serves more customers during lunch and dinner times, but since the average hourly rate is given, I'll use that.\n\nI think I've considered all possible aspects of this problem, and both methods I used to calculate the weekly customer count give me the same result of 6,720.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant serves 6,720 customers in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6720} \\]"
