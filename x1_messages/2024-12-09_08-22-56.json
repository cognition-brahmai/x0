He was indeed associated with the Impressionist movement, although he preferred to be called a \"realist.\" Degas is renowned for his paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings of ballerinas and horse races, among other subjects. His works often captured the movement and fluidity of his subjects, making him one of the most celebrated artists of the 19th century."
