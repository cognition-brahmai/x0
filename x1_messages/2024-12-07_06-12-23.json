        "content": "Sure! Here's a recursive function in Python to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    else:\n        seq = fibonacci(n - 1)\n        seq.append(seq[-1] + seq[-2])\n        return seq\n```\n\nYou can call this function with the desired value of n to get the Fibonacci sequence up to that term. For example, `fibonacci(10)` will return the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nNote that this implementation uses recursion, which may not be efficient for large values of n due to the exponential time complexity. For larger values of n, an iterative approach or memoization technique is recommended to improve performance."
