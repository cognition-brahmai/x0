Below is a PowerShell script that checks the status of a list of services on a Windows machine and outputs the name of the service, its current status, and start type.\n\n```powershell\n# List of services to check\n$services = @(\n    \"Service1\",\n    \"Service2\",\n    \"Service3\",\n    # Add more services as needed\n)\n\n# Check each service and output the required information\nforeach ($service in $services) {\n    try {\n        $svc = Get-Service -Name $service -ErrorAction Stop\n        [PSCustomObject]@{\n            Name       = $svc.Name\n            Status     = $svc.Status\n            StartType  = $svc.StartType\n        }\n    }\n    catch {\n        [PSCustomObject]@{\n            Name       = $service\n            Status     = \"Not Found\"\n            StartType  = \"N/A\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **List of Services**: Define an array of service names you want to check.\n2. **Loop Through Services**: Use a `foreach` loop to iterate through each service in the list.\n3. **Get Service Information**: Use `Get-Service` to retrieve information about each service.\n4. **Handle Errors**: If a service is not found, catch the error and output that the service was not found.\n5. **Output Information**: Use a custom object to output the service name, status, and start type.\n\nThis script will provide a clear overview of the status and start type of each specified service on the Windows machine."
