The company currently stores 500,000 items in its warehouse, occupying 80% of the available space. With the expansion, they expect to add another 300,000 items to their inventory. Determine the additional storage space required, as well as the percentage increase in warehouse size needed to accommodate the expanded inventory without exceeding 90% occupancy."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got an online retailer that's expanding its product range, which means they need more space in their warehouse to store the additional items.\n\nFirst, let's understand what they have right now:\n\n- They currently store 500,000 items.\n\n- These items occupy 80% of the available warehouse space.\n\nFrom this, we can figure out the total warehouse space they currently have. Let's denote the total current warehouse space as \\( S \\). Since 500,000 items occupy 80% of \\( S \\), we can write:\n\n\\[ 500,000 = 0.8S \\]\n\nTo find \\( S \\), we can rearrange this equation:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{500,000}{0.8} = 625,000 \\text{ items} \\]\n\nSo, the total current warehouse space can hold 625,000 items.\n\nNow, with the expansion, they're adding another 300,000 items to their inventory. So, the total number of items after expansion will be:\n\n\\[ 500,000 + 300,000 = 800,000 \\text{ items} \\]\n\nThey want to accommodate this expanded inventory without exceeding 90% occupancy. So, we need to find the total warehouse space \\( S_{\\text{new}} \\) such that 800,000 items occupy up to 90% of \\( S_{\\text{new}} \\).\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 800,000 = 0.9 S_{\\text{new}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( S_{\\text{new}} \\):\n\n\\[ S_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{800,000}{0.9} \\approx 888,888.89 \\text{ items} \\]\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an item, we'll round up to the next whole number, so \\( S_{\\text{new}} = 888,889 \\) items.\n\nNow, to find the additional storage space required, we subtract the current total space from \\( S_{\\text{new}} \\):\n\n\\[ \\text{Additional space} = S_{\\text{new}} - S = 888,889 - 625,000 = 263,889 \\text{ items} \\]\n\nSo, they need an additional 263,889 items worth of space.\n\nNext, to find the percentage increase in warehouse size needed, we can calculate the ratio of additional space to the current total space and then convert it to a percentage:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Additional space}}{S} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{263,889}{625,000} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 42.22\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, they need to increase their warehouse size by approximately 42.22% to accommodate the expanded inventory without exceeding 90% occupancy.\n\nLet me just double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the current situation:\n\n- 500,000 items occupy 80% of the warehouse.\n\n- So, total current warehouse space \\( S = \\frac{500,000}{0.8} = 625,000 \\) items.\n\nAfter expansion:\n\n- Total items = 500,000 + 300,000 = 800,000 items.\n\n- They want this to be 90% of the new warehouse space.\n\n- So, \\( S_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{800,000}{0.9} \\approx 888,888.89 \\) items.\n\n- Additional space needed = 888,889 - 625,000 = 263,889 items.\n\n- Percentage increase = \\( \\frac{263,889}{625,000} \\times 100 \\approx 42.22\\% \\).\n\nEverything seems to check out. I think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe additional storage space required is \\(\\boxed{263889}\\) items, and the percentage increase in warehouse size needed is approximately \\(\\boxed{42.22\\%}\\)."
