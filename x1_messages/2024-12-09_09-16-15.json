        "content": "So Grandma hid five different shaped presents for her grandchildren: a square, a circle, a triangle, a star, and a heart. Each shape corresponds to a specific grandchild. But then Grandpa steps in and rearranges the presents so that none of the grandchildren find the shape that Grandma intended for them. On top of that, he adds a sixth present, a hexagon, as a surprise.\n\nNow, the question is, how do the grandchildren know which present was meant for them when they start searching?\n\nHmm, this sounds like a puzzle involving some kind of matching or misdirection. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are five grandchildren, each intended to receive one specific shape: square, circle, triangle, star, and heart. Grandma hid them in various locations around the house.\n\nThen, Grandpa rearranges them so that each grandchild finds a different shape than what Grandma intended. So, none of the grandchildren get the shape they were supposed to get.\n\nAdditionally, Grandpa adds a sixth present, a hexagon, which wasn't there originally.\n\nNow, the grandchildren are going to start searching for the presents. The challenge is to figure out how they can determine which present was meant for whom, given that the arrangement has been altered by Grandpa.\n\nLet's consider what information the grandchildren have:\n\n1. They know there are five specific shapes that were intended for them: square, circle, triangle, star, and heart.\n\n2. They know that Grandpa rearranged the presents so that none of them are in the spot where Grandma intended.\n\n3. There's an extra present, a hexagon, which wasn't part of the original plan.\n\nFirst, perhaps the grandchildren know who was supposed to get which shape. If they do, then the problem is straightforward: they just need to find the present that matches the shape they were supposed to get, knowing that it's not in the original spot.\n\nBut if they don't know who was supposed to get which shape, then it becomes more complicated.\n\nWait, the problem states that \"each present corresponds to a specific grandchild.\" So, presumably, the grandchildren know which shape is intended for which person.\n\nAssuming that's the case, then each grandchild is looking for their specific shape, but they know it's not in the spot Grandma intended because Grandpa rearranged them.\n\nSo, they would need to search the house, excluding the original spots, to find their respective shapes.\n\nBut there's an added complication: the extra hexagon present. Since it's a surprise, it doesn't correspond to any specific grandchild. So, whoever finds the hexagon will have an extra present, but it doesn't belong to anyone specifically.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"how do the grandchildren know which present was meant for them when they start searching?\" So, perhaps the confusion is about identifying which present was intended for whom, given the rearrangement.\n\nIf the grandchildren know who was supposed to get which shape, then they can identify their intended present based on the shape, regardless of where it's hidden now.\n\nFor example, if Alice was supposed to get the square, she needs to find the square, wherever it is now, knowing it's not in the spot Grandma hid it.\n\nSimilarly, Bob was supposed to get the circle, so he looks for the circle, and so on.\n\nThe addition of the hexagon complicates things because now there are six presents, but only five grandchildren have specific shapes assigned to them.\n\nSo, when they find presents, they need to identify which one was intended for them based on the shape, understanding that the hexagon is an extra surprise that doesn't belong to anyone specifically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hexagon is intended for one of the grandchildren, but since it was added by Grandpa, it might be considered a bonus.\n\nBut based on the initial statement, it seems the hexagon is just an additional present, not assigned to any specific grandchild.\n\nTherefore, the grandchildren should focus on finding the five specific shapes they were intended to receive, knowing that none of them will be in the spots Grandma originally hid them, due to Grandpa's rearrangement.\n\nSo, their approach should be:\n\n1. Each grandchild knows which shape is intended for them.\n\n2. They search the house, excluding the original hiding spots, to find their respective shapes.\n\n3. Any present that doesn't match their intended shape isn't for them, except for the hexagon, which is a surprise and not assigned to anyone.\n\nWait, but the problem says Grandpa added a sixth present as a surprise, so it's not assigned to any specific grandchild.\n\nTherefore, when a grandchild finds a present, they can check if it's their intended shape. If it is, they've found their present. If it's not, or if it's the hexagon, it's not for them.\n\nBut there's a potential issue here: since Grandpa rearranged the presents so that none of them are in their original spots, there might be a situation where a grandchild finds a present that isn't their intended shape, but another grandchild's shape.\n\nWait, no. If each present corresponds to a specific grandchild, and Grandpa rearranged them so that each present is not in the spot intended by Grandma, but still each present is the same shape, just moved to a different location.\n\nSo, the shapes themselves haven't changed; only their hiding spots have been altered.\n\nTherefore, if a grandchild finds a present, they can identify it by its shape and determine if it's their intended present.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Alice is looking for the square.\n\n- She finds a present, checks its shape.\n\n- If it's a square, it's her present, even though it's not in the spot Grandma hid it.\n\n- If it's another shape, it's not her present.\n\n- If it's the hexagon, it's not assigned to her.\n\nSimilarly for the other grandchildren.\n\nSo, in essence, the grandchildren need to search the house, find the presents, check their shapes, and identify their intended presents based on the shapes, knowing that none of them are in the original hiding spots.\n\nThe addition of the hexagon means that there's an extra present that doesn't correspond to any grandchild, so whoever finds it gets a surprise, but it's not their intended present.\n\nTherefore, the key for the grandchildren is to focus on finding the present that matches their assigned shape, wherever it may be, excluding the original hiding spots.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but perhaps there's more to it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the grandchildren don't know who was supposed to get which shape. If that's the case, then it becomes more complicated.\n\nLet me check the original statement: \"each present corresponds to a specific grandchild.\" It seems that the correspondence is known, at least to Grandma and Grandpa.\n\nBut perhaps the grandchildren don't know who was supposed to get which shape.\n\nIf that's the case, then they wouldn't know which shape is theirs, and finding a present wouldn't help them determine if it's intended for them.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"how do the grandchildren know which present was meant for them when they start searching?\" This suggests that they need to figure out which present corresponds to which grandchild.\n\nSo, perhaps the correspondence isn't known to the grandchildren beforehand.\n\nIn that case, the problem is more complex.\n\nLet's consider that scenario: the grandchildren don't know who was supposed to get which shape.\n\nThey find presents, each with a different shape, and they need to determine which present was meant for which grandchild.\n\nAdditionally, there's an extra hexagon present that wasn't part of the original plan.\n\nThis seems like a matching problem where the grandchildren need to figure out the correct assignment of shapes to grandchildren, knowing that Grandpa rearranged the presents so that none are in their intended spots.\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of derangements in combinatorics, where items are arranged in a way that none are in their correct positions.\n\nIn this case, the presents have been deranged by Grandpa.\n\nSo, the grandchildren need to figure out the original assignment of shapes to grandchildren, despite the derangement.\n\nBut how can they do that?\n\nPerhaps there are clues on the presents or in the hiding spots that can hint at who should get which shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grandchildren can ask Grandma or Grandpa for hints.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any such clues or interactions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grandchildren can make deductions based on process of elimination or by communicating with each other about what they find.\n\nFor example, if one grandchild finds a present and identifies its shape, they can tell the others what shape they found, helping to eliminate possibilities for the others.\n\nLet's consider that approach.\n\nSuppose there are five grandchildren: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dana, and Eve.\n\nOriginal assignments:\n\n- Alice: square\n\n- Bob: circle\n\n- Charlie: triangle\n\n- Dana: star\n\n- Eve: heart\n\nGrandpa rearranges them so that none are in their intended spots.\n\nHe also adds a hexagon.\n\nNow, the grandchildren start searching.\n\nSuppose Alice finds a present and checks its shape; it's a circle.\n\nSince she was supposed to get the square, but she found a circle, which was intended for Bob, but because of Grandpa's rearrangement, it's not in the spot where Grandma hid it.\n\nBut Alice doesn't know that; all she knows is that she found a circle, and she was supposed to get a square.\n\nSo, she knows that this isn't her present.\n\nSimilarly, Bob finds a present and checks its shape; it's a triangle.\n\nHe was supposed to get a circle, so this isn't his present.\n\nCharlie finds a heart; he was supposed to get a triangle, so this isn't his.\n\nDana finds a star; she was supposed to get a star, but since Grandpa rearranged them, this can't be her present.\n\nWait, but Dana was supposed to get the star, and she finds a star, but Grandpa rearranged them so that none are in their intended spots, so perhaps the star she finds isn't the one Grandma hid for her.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Grandpa replaced the intended present with another one of the same shape, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the presents are unique items, so the star present is the one intended for Dana, but just hidden in a different spot.\n\nIn that case, Dana finds a star, which is her intended shape, but since Grandpa rearranged them, it might not be the one intended for her.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps it's better to assume that each present is uniquely identified by its shape, and Grandma hid them in specific spots, each corresponding to one grandchild.\n\nThen, Grandpa rearranged them so that no present is in the spot intended for its assigned grandchild.\n\nNow, the grandchildren are searching for their intended presents, knowing that they're not in the spots Grandma hid them.\n\nSo, they need to search elsewhere in the house for their respective shapes.\n\nThe addition of the hexagon complicates things because it's an extra present that doesn't correspond to any grandchild.\n\nSo, when a grandchild finds a present, they need to check its shape:\n\n- If it matches their intended shape, it's their present.\n\n- If it doesn't match, it's not their present.\n\n- If it's the hexagon, it's not assigned to anyone.\n\nHowever, since Grandpa rearranged the presents so that none are in their intended spots, there might be a situation where a grandchild finds their present in a different spot.\n\nBut, in that case, since Grandpa ensured that none are in their intended spots, perhaps he moved them to spots intended for other grandchildren.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the grandchildren finding their presents based on the shapes, knowing that the spots have been altered.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the grandchildren know the original assignments, i.e., who was supposed to get which shape.\n\nIf they know that, then they can look for their specific shape, knowing it's not in the original spot.\n\nFor example, Alice knows she's supposed to get the square, so she looks for the square, knowing it's not in the spot Grandma hid it.\n\nSimilarly, Bob looks for the circle, not in its original spot, and so on.\n\nThe hexagon is an extra present that doesn't correspond to anyone, so whoever finds it gets a surprise.\n\nAlternatively, if the grandchildren don't know who was supposed to get which shape, then they have a more significant problem, as they wouldn't know which shape to look for.\n\nBut given that Grandma told them that each present corresponds to a specific grandchild, it's likely that they know who gets which shape.\n\nTherefore, the solution is that each grandchild should look for their assigned shape, understanding that it's not in the original hiding spot due to Grandpa's rearrangement.\n\nThey can search the house, find the present that matches their assigned shape, and that's their intended present.\n\nThe hexagon present is just an extra surprise that doesn't belong to anyone specifically.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Each grandchild should look for the shape that was intended for them, knowing it's not in the original hiding spot due to Grandpa's rearrangement. The hexagon is an extra surprise not assigned to any grandchild.}} \\]"
