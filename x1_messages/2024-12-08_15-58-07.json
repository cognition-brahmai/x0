Each step should have a corresponding evidence variable (#E[index]), which will be the output of a specific function given an input string (which could be the user's question, previous evidence variables, or a mix).\n\nAvailable tools:\nBing[input]: Allows users to search for information on the internet via Bing. Useful for locating sites potentially containing the answer.\nReadability[input]: Takes a URL as input and returns a simplified version of the webpage's text.\nLinkCollector[input]: From a block of text, extracts URLs and provides them as newline-separated output.\nFactoidQA[input]: Answers factual questions based on an input passage of text. The input should be a text question referencing a #E[n] variable, like \"What is the tallest mountain, given #E1?\"\n\nEnsure only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n#E1 = [Function to call with input]\nPlan: [Next action, based on #E1]\n#E2 = [Next function to call with input, possibly referencing prior evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Where was Nikola Tesla born and what notable inventions did he make?"
