        "content": "Alright, I'll help you create a simple command-line calculator in Python. This calculator will take two numbers and an operator as input and perform the specified operation. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to get input from the user. We'll ask for two numbers and the operator they want to use. Then, based on the operator, we'll perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n\nWe should also handle possible errors, like division by zero or invalid operators, to make sure the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.\n\nLet's start by writing the code to get input from the user.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Get Input:** Prompt the user to enter two numbers and the operation they wish to perform.\n2. **Perform Operation:** Based on the operation provided, perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n3. **Handle Errors:** Ensure the program handles potential errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid operators.\n\nHere is the complete Python script for the calculator:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Get the first number from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    # Get the operator from the user\n    operator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    # Get the second number from the user\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n    # Perform the operation based on the operator\n    if operator == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 != 0:\n            result = num1 / num2\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n            return\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\")\n        return\n\n    # Display the result\n    print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The script prompts the user to enter two numbers and the operator.\n   - `float(input())` is used to convert the input strings to floating-point numbers for mathematical operations.\n\n2. **Operation Logic:**\n   - The script uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to determine which operation to perform based on the operator provided.\n   - For division, it checks if the denominator is zero to avoid a division by zero error.\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   - If an invalid operator is entered, the script informs the user and exits.\n   - If division by zero is attempted, the script displays an error message and exits.\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - The result of the operation is printed to the console.\n\nThis script provides a basic functional calculator that can be run from the command line and handles common edge cases to ensure it runs smoothly."
