It extensively deals with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of power and resources. Political scientists \"see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works.\" International relations, as a discipline, is a branch of political science that studies relationships between countries, the roles of sovereign states, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and multinational corporations.

        "content": "I think the answer is E. International Relations. But let me think about this carefully. The question is asking which branch of political science is most directly involved in studying the relationship between countries. So, international relations deals specifically with relationships between countries, right? That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the other options to make sure. Option A is Comparative Politics. I know that comparative politics involves comparing different political systems or institutions across countries. So, it's more about looking at how different countries govern themselves, rather than their relationships with each other. So, maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption B is Political Theory. That seems more abstract, dealing with ideas and philosophies about politics, like democracy, socialism, etc. It's more about the principles behind politics rather than the interactions between countries.\n\nOption C is Public Administration. I think this is more about how governments implement policies and manage public services within a country. So, it's internal to a country, not about relationships between countries.\n\nOption D is Public Law. I believe this deals with the legal frameworks that govern relationships between individuals and the state. Again, this seems more internal to a country.\n\nSo, coming back to Option E, International Relations, it specifically studies relationships between countries, including their interactions, conflicts, cooperation, and so on. It also looks at entities like intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, and multinational corporations that operate across national boundaries.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that International Relations would be the most directly involved in studying the relationship between countries. The other options seem to focus more on internal politics or abstract theories.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of the other options could have a indirect relationship to international relations. For example, Comparative Politics might look at how different political systems affect a country's foreign policy, but still, that's somewhat different from directly studying the relationships between countries.\n\nPolitical Theory could potentially influence international relations, but again, it's more about the ideas that underpin political behavior rather than the actual relationships between nations.\n\nPublic Administration and Public Law seem even more removed from the direct study of international relationships.\n\nSo, all in all, I think E. International Relations is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
