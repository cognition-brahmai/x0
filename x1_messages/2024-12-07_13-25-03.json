        "content": "So you have a rectangular garden that's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, and you want to build a fence around it with an additional 5 feet on each side. You're asking for the perimeter of this fenced area.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. The garden is rectangular, so it has two lengths and two widths. The lengths are 20 feet each, and the widths are 15 feet each. Normally, the perimeter would just be the sum of all these sides, but since you're adding an extra 5 feet on each side, the dimensions of the area to be fenced will be larger.\n\nSo, for the fenced area:\n\n- Each length will be the original length plus 5 feet on one end and another 5 feet on the other end. That means each length will be 20 feet + 5 feet + 5 feet = 30 feet.\n\n- Similarly, each width will be the original width plus 5 feet on one side and another 5 feet on the other side. So, each width will be 15 feet + 5 feet + 5 feet = 25 feet.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the fenced area, we need to add up all four sides: two lengths and two widths.\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 length + 2 \u00d7 width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 30 feet + 2 \u00d7 25 feet\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n2 \u00d7 30 = 60 feet\n\n2 \u00d7 25 = 50 feet\n\nSo, total perimeter = 60 feet + 50 feet = 110 feet\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nOriginal garden dimensions:\n\nLength = 20 feet\n\nWidth = 15 feet\n\nAdding 5 feet on each side means:\n\n- Length increases by 10 feet in total (5 feet on each end)\n\n- Width increases by 10 feet in total (5 feet on each side)\n\nSo, new dimensions:\n\nLength = 20 + 10 = 30 feet\n\nWidth = 15 + 10 = 25 feet\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width) = 2 \u00d7 (30 + 25) = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110 feet\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, you could think of the additional area beyond the garden. The fence is 5 feet beyond the garden on all sides, so it's like adding a border around the garden.\n\nBut in any case, the calculation remains the same.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fenced area is 110 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{110} \\]"
