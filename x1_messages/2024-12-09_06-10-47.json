        "content": "Let's see. So, the train travels at two different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to find out the total distance it covered. I remember that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, so maybe I can calculate the distance for each part of the journey separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, the train goes 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance for this part should be 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nThen, it travels at 30 miles per hour for the next 4 hours. So, the distance for this part would be 30 miles per hour times 4 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together: 120 miles plus 120 miles equals 240 miles.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Is there any other factor I need to consider, like stops or changes in speed between the two parts? The question doesn't mention any other details, so I think this should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average speed over the entire journey and multiply it by the total time, but that might be more complicated. Let's see: the total time traveled is 2 hours plus 4 hours, which is 6 hours. If I were to find the average speed, it would be the total distance divided by the total time. But since I don't know the total distance yet, that doesn't help me directly.\n\nNo, I think my first approach is better. Calculate each part separately and then sum them up. So, 60 mph for 2 hours is 120 miles, and 30 mph for 4 hours is 120 miles, totaling 240 miles.\n\nI think that's the answer: the train traveled 240 miles in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
