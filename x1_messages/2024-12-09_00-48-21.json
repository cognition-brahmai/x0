        "content": "So the store is offering a 20% discount on all items, and I have a shirt that originally costs $45. I need to find out what the new price is after the discount. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. Percentages can be a bit tricky, but I think I've got it. 20% means 20 per 100, right? So, for every $100, the discount is $20. But my shirt costs $45, which is less than $100, so the discount will be less than $20.\n\nI think the first step is to calculate how much the discount is in dollars. To find 20% of $45, I can multiply 45 by 20% . Now, percentages can be converted to decimals for easier calculation. 20% as a decimal is 0.20. So, 45 times 0.20 should give me the discount amount.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 45 \u00d7 0.20. Well, 45 times 2 is 90, and since 0.20 has two decimal places, the result should have two decimal places as well. But 90 with two decimal places is 9.00, which is just $9. So, the discount is $9.\n\nNow, to find the new price, I need to subtract the discount from the original price. So, $45 minus $9. That's straightforward: 45 - 9 = 36. Therefore, the new price of the shirt after the discount is $36.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Instead of calculating the discount and then subtracting it, perhaps I can find what 80% of the original price is, since there's a 20% discount.\n\nIf 20% is discounted, that means the customer pays 80% of the original price. So, 80% of $45 should give me the same result. Let's see: 80% as a decimal is 0.80. So, 45 times 0.80.\n\n45 \u00d7 0.80: 45 times 8 is 360, and with two decimal places, it's 36.00, which is $36. Okay, that matches my earlier result. So, the new price is indeed $36.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can verify this with another method. Let's try using fractions. 20% is the same as 20/100, which simplifies to 1/5. So, the discount is 1/5 of $45. Let's calculate that: 45 divided by 5 is 9, so the discount is $9. Subtracting that from $45 gives $36 again.\n\nAll right, no matter which way I approach it, I keep getting $36 as the new price. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
