It's like, why can't we just stay in bed and sleep some more? But no, there's always someone who thinks mornings are the best part of the day. Pah! They probably haven't had to wake up before the sun is even thinking about rising. It's not natural, if you ask me. And don't even get me started on breakfast. Toast that's either burnt or not toasted enough, coffee that's either too strong or not strong enough. It's all just a big headache before you've even properly woken up. So, no, I'm not a fan of mornings. Not at all."
