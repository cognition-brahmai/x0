        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that checks email addresses using regular expressions. The script needs to accept multiple emails separated by commas and then print out only the valid ones. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what makes an email address valid. According to the standard (RFC 5322), email addresses have a specific format: local-part@domain. The local part can be pretty flexible, including letters, digits, and special characters like dots, hyphens, and underscores. The domain part must have at least one dot, and the top-level domain has to have between 2 to 6 characters.\n\nBut regular expressions can be tricky. I've seen many regex patterns for email validation, but some are more permissive than others. I need to find a balance between being strict enough to catch obvious errors and lenient enough to accept valid but unusual addresses.\n\nLet me start by recalling the basic structure of a regex for emails. I think it should match something like:\n\n- One or more characters that are letters, digits, dots, hyphens, or underscores before the @ symbol.\n\n- Then the @ symbol.\n\n- Then the domain name, which should have one or more segments separated by dots.\n\n- Each segment should consist of letters or digits.\n\n- Finally, the top-level domain, which should have at least two characters.\n\nBut I need to be careful with special cases. For example, emails can have plus signs in the local part, like username+something@example.com. Also, quoted strings are allowed in the local part under certain conditions, but that might be too complicated for this script.\n\nMaybe I should look up a standard regex pattern for email validation. There are many resources online that provide regex for emails, but I need to choose one that is reliable.\n\nAfter some research, I found a regex pattern that seems to cover most cases:\n\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- `^` asserts the start of the string.\n\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` matches the local part, allowing letters, digits, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, and hyphens.\n\n- `@` matches the at symbol.\n\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches the domain name parts, allowing letters, digits, dots, and hyphens.\n\n- `\\.` matches the dot before the top-level domain.\n\n- `[a-zA-Z]{2,}` matches the top-level domain, requiring at least two letters.\n\n- `$` asserts the end of the string.\n\nThis seems pretty good, but I recall that some email providers allow numbers in the top-level domain, like .info or .name, which have more than two characters. So, maybe I should adjust the top-level domain part to allow more characters.\n\nLet me modify the regex to allow top-level domains with up to six letters:\n\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$\n```\n\nThat should cover most common TLDs like .com, .org, .net, .info, .name, etc.\n\nBut wait, there are country-specific TLDs with more than six letters, like .museum or .travel. If I want to be more inclusive, I could increase the range to `{2,24}` or even remove the upper limit altogether, since TLDs can be longer.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, I'll stick with `{2,6}` for now, as longer TLDs might be less common.\n\nAnother thing to consider is subdomains. Domains can have multiple subdomains, like mail.subdomain.example.com. The regex should handle that properly.\n\nLooking back at the domain part: `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\. [a-zA-Z]{2,6}`, it should handle subdomains because it allows multiple segments separated by dots.\n\nBut I should test it with some examples to make sure.\n\nLet's try \"example@sub.domain.com\". According to the regex, it should match:\n\n- Local part: \"example\"\n\n- Domain: \"sub.domain.com\"\n\n- TLD: \"com\"\n\nThat seems fine.\n\nWhat about \"user.name+test@example.co.uk\"? Here, the local part is \"user.name+test\", domain is \"example.co.uk\", TLD is \"uk\".\n\nWait a minute, \"co.uk\" is a country code top-level domain. My current regex might not handle this properly because it expects a single TLD segment.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Many email addresses use country code TLDs with multiple segments, like .co.uk, .com.au, etc.\n\nI need to adjust the regex to account for these cases.\n\nAfter some research, I found that a better regex pattern for email validation, which handles multi-segment TLDs, is:\n\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\nWait, that's similar to what I had before, but without the restriction on the TLD length. Maybe I need to make it more flexible.\n\nActually, the issue with \"co.uk\" is that it has two segments in the TLD. To handle this, I need to ensure that the domain part allows for multiple subdomains and TLDs.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use a regex that matches the general structure of an email without being too restrictive about the TLD length.\n\nLet me consider this pattern:\n\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\nThis should match \"example@sub.domain.co.uk\" because:\n\n- Local part: \"example\"\n\n- Domain: \"sub.domain.co.uk\"\n\n- TLD: \"uk\"\n\nBut actually, the TLD is \"co.uk\", which is a country code TLD with two parts. My regex might not recognize \"co.uk\" as a valid TLD because it's looking for at least two letters at the end.\n\nTo handle country code TLDs properly, I might need a more complex regex.\n\nUpon further research, I found that a more comprehensive regex for email validation is:\n\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\nBut this still might not cover all cases. Maybe I should consider using a library that handles email validation more accurately, but since the task is to use regular expressions, I'll stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to make the regex more flexible by allowing multiple segments in the TLD.\n\nHere's an attempt:\n\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})+$\n```\n\nIn this version:\n\n- The domain part is `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`, followed by one or more segments that start with a dot and have at least two letters.\n\nThis should handle \"co.uk\" because \"co\" and \"uk\" are both segments with at least two letters each.\n\nLet's test it with \"example@sub.domain.co.uk\":\n\n- Local part: \"example\"\n\n- Domain: \"sub.domain.co.uk\"\n\n- Segments: \"sub\", \"domain\", \"co\", \"uk\"\n\nEach segment after the last dot must have at least two letters, which holds true here.\n\nAnother test case: \"user.name+test@example.com.au\"\n\n- Local part: \"user.name+test\"\n\n- Domain: \"example.com.au\"\n\n- Segments: \"example\", \"com\", \"au\"\n\nAgain, \"com\" and \"au\" are both valid segments with at least two letters.\n\nThis seems better. I'll proceed with this pattern.\n\nNow, the script needs to accept multiple email addresses separated by commas and print only the valid ones.\n\nI need to handle input with multiple emails, split them by commas, and validate each one using the regex.\n\nAlso, I should handle leading and trailing spaces around the emails, in case the user adds spaces by mistake.\n\nIn Python, I can use the `re` module for regular expressions.\n\nFirst, I'll import the `re` module.\n\nThen, I'll define the regex pattern as a raw string to avoid escape character issues.\n\nNext, I'll prompt the user to enter email addresses separated by commas.\n\nI'll read the input using `input()` function.\n\nThen, split the input string by commas, and strip any leading or trailing spaces from each email.\n\nFor each email, I'll use `re.match()` to check if it matches the pattern.\n\nIf it does, I'll print it.\n\nOtherwise, I'll skip it.\n\nI should also handle the case where the user enters no email addresses or only invalid ones.\n\nIn such cases, I'll print a message indicating that no valid emails were found.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Import the `re` module.\n\n2. Define the regex pattern.\n\n3. Prompt the user to enter email addresses separated by commas.\n\n4. Read the input.\n\n5. Split the input by commas and strip spaces.\n\n6. For each email:\n\na. If it matches the pattern, print it.\n\n7. If no valid emails are found, print a message.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, I'll write the actual code.\n\nBut before that, I need to make sure that the regex handles various edge cases correctly.\n\nLet's think about some test cases:\n\n- Valid emails:\n\n- \"example@gmail.com\"\n\n- \"user.name+test@example.com\"\n\n- \"numbers.123@example.co.uk\"\n\n- \"letters-only@example.net\"\n\n- \"hyphens-in-local-part@example.org\"\n\n- \"underscores_in_local_part@example.com\"\n\n- Invalid emails:\n\n- \"invalid_email@\"\n\n- \"@missinglocalpart.com\"\n\n- \"noatsign.com\"\n\n- \"local(part@example.com\"\n\n- \"local..part@example.com\"\n\n- \"local-part@.missingtld\"\n\n- \"local-part@domain.a\" (TLD too short)\n\n- \"local-part@domain.toolongtld1234567\"\n\nI need to ensure that the regex correctly identifies these as valid or invalid.\n\nLet's test the regex with these examples.\n\nFirst, the valid ones:\n\n1. \"example@gmail.com\"\n\n- Matches the pattern.\n\n2. \"user.name+test@example.com\"\n\n- Matches the pattern.\n\n3. \"numbers.123@example.co.uk\"\n\n- Matches the pattern.\n\n4. \"letters-only@example.net\"\n\n- Matches the pattern.\n\n5. \"hyphens-in-local-part@example.org\"\n\n- Matches the pattern.\n\n6. \"underscores_in_local_part@example.com\"\n\n- Matches the pattern.\n\nNow, the invalid ones:\n\n1. \"invalid_email@\"\n\n- No domain, should not match.\n\n2. \"@missinglocalpart.com\"\n\n- No local part, should not match.\n\n3. \"noatsign.com\"\n\n- No @ symbol, should not match.\n\n4. \"local(part@example.com\"\n\n- Invalid character in local part, should not match.\n\n5. \"local..part@example.com\"\n\n- Consecutive dots in local part, should not match.\n\n6. \"local-part@.missingtld\"\n\n- Domain starts with a dot, should not match.\n\n7. \"local-part@domain.a\"\n\n- TLD too short (1 character), should not match.\n\n8. \"local-part@domain.toolongtld1234567\"\n\n- TLD too long (more than 6 characters), but since I allowed {2,} in the regex, it should match.\n\nWait a minute, according to my earlier regex, \"local-part@domain.toolongtld1234567\" should match because the TLD has more than six letters.\n\nBut in reality, TLDs have a maximum length, but I'm not sure what it is. I think the maximum length for a TLD is around 6 characters, but there might be exceptions.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll allow {2,} in the TLD, as per the regex.\n\nBut perhaps I should limit it to {2,24} to be more realistic, as some TLDs can be longer.\n\nLet me adjust the regex to:\n\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})+$\n```\n\nWait, I already have that. But in this version, each segment after the domain has at least two letters.\n\nSo, \"local-part@domain.toolongtld1234567\" would still match, as each segment (\"domain\", \"toolongtld1234567\") has more than two letters.\n\nIf I want to limit the TLD to a certain length, I need to specify that the last segment has {2,6} letters.\n\nBut that would require looking ahead in the regex, which might be complicated.\n\nFor now, I'll keep it as is, allowing segments with {2,} letters in the domain.\n\nNow, back to the script.\n\nI need to handle multiple emails separated by commas.\n\nFor example, input like \"example@gmail.com, user.name@example.org, invalid_email@\"\n\nThe script should split this into three emails, validate them, and print only the valid ones: \"example@gmail.com\" and \"user.name@example.org\"\n\nI need to make sure that the splitting is done correctly and that each email is checked individually.\n\nAlso, I should handle cases where there are spaces around the commas, like \"example@gmail.com , user.name@example.org\".\n\nSo, when splitting, I should strip any spaces around the email addresses.\n\nIn Python, I can use the `split()` function with ',' as the separator, and then strip spaces using `strip()` on each part.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python script that validates email addresses entered by the user using regular expressions. The script should accept multiple email addresses separated by commas and print only the valid email addresses.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Regular Expression (Regex)**: We use a regex pattern to match valid email addresses. The pattern used is:\n   ```regex\n   ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})+$\n   ```\n   This pattern ensures:\n   - The local part contains alphanumeric characters and special characters like `._%+-`.\n   - The domain part contains alphanumeric characters and may include hyphens.\n   - The domain has at least one subdomain part with at least two letters.\n\n2. **Input Handling**: \n   - Read the input string of email addresses.\n   - Split the input string by commas and strip any leading or trailing spaces from each email address.\n\n3. **Validation and Output**:\n   - Use the regex pattern to validate each email address.\n   - Print only the valid email addresses.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the regex pattern for validating email addresses\n    email_pattern = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})+$')\n    \n    # Prompt the user to enter email addresses separated by commas\n    email_input = input(\"Enter email addresses separated by commas: \")\n    \n    # Split the input string by commas and strip spaces\n    emails = [email.strip() for email in email_input.split(',')]\n    \n    # List to hold valid emails\n    valid_emails = []\n    \n    # Check each email against the pattern\n    for email in emails:\n        if email_pattern.match(email):\n            valid_emails.append(email)\n    \n    # Print valid emails\n    if valid_emails:\n        print(\"Valid emails:\")\n        for email in valid_emails:\n            print(email)\n    else:\n        print(\"No valid emails found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Regex Pattern**:\n   - `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches the local part of the email.\n   - `@`: Matches the @ symbol.\n   - `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches the domain name.\n   - `(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})+$`: Ensures there is at least one subdomain with two or more letters.\n\n2. **Input and Splitting**:\n   - The input string is split by commas, and each part is stripped of leading and trailing spaces to handle any extraneous whitespace.\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Each email is checked against the regex pattern using `re.match`.\n   - Valid emails are collected and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that only properly formatted email addresses are considered valid and printed, providing a robust solution for email validation."
