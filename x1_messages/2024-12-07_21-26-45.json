        "content": "So the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system by adding more buses. They currently have 100 buses, with an average age of 7 years, and each bus lasts 15 years. They plan to increase the fleet by 20% over the next five years. I need to figure out how many new buses they need to buy each year to account for both replacing old buses and expanding the fleet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what their current fleet situation is. They have 100 buses, average age 7 years, and each bus has a lifespan of 15 years. So, some buses are older and will need to be replaced soon, while others are newer and will last longer.\n\nTo plan for replacements, I should figure out how many buses reach the end of their lifespan each year. Since the average age is 7 years, and lifespans are 15 years, perhaps I can assume that buses are distributed uniformly in age from 0 to 15 years. But wait, with an average age of 7 years, it's likely that the age distribution is not uniform. Maybe I need to consider a more realistic distribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify and assume that the buses are evenly spread in age, so each year, approximately 100 buses / 15 years = about 6.67 buses reach the end of their lifespan per year. But actually, that doesn't make sense because if they have 100 buses, and each has a 15-year lifespan, then annually, they need to replace 100/15 \u2248 6.67 buses. But considering they want to increase the fleet by 20% over five years, I need to factor in both replacements and expansions.\n\nWait, let's first calculate the expansion requirement. They want to increase the fleet by 20% over five years. So, 20% of 100 buses is 20 buses. Therefore, over five years, they need to add 20 buses to the fleet, in addition to replacing the old ones.\n\nSo, total new buses needed over five years = buses for expansion + buses for replacement.\n\nBuses for expansion = 20.\n\nNow, buses for replacement: each year, they need to replace buses that are 15 years old. Assuming they've been replacing buses consistently, then annually, they replace about 100/15 \u2248 6.67 buses.\n\nBut wait, their current fleet is 100 buses with an average age of 7 years. If they've been replacing buses regularly, then the number of buses reaching 15 years each year would be consistent.\n\nHowever, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the fleet over the next five years, taking into account the current ages of the buses.\n\nBut since we don't have the exact age distribution, maybe it's acceptable to assume that each year, they need to replace 100/15 \u2248 6.67 buses.\n\nOver five years, that would be 6.67 * 5 \u2248 33.33 buses.\n\nBut they also need to add 20 buses for expansion.\n\nSo, total new buses needed over five years: 33.33 + 20 = 53.33 buses.\n\nDivided over five years, that's about 53.33 / 5 \u2248 10.67 buses per year.\n\nBut since they can't buy a fraction of a bus, they'd need to round up or down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more precise way to calculate this, considering the current age distribution.\n\nLet's consider that the average age is 7 years. If the age distribution is uniform, then the number of buses reaching 15 years each year is consistent.\n\nBut in reality, if the average age is 7, and lifespans are 15 years, then buses older than 15 years should already have been replaced.\n\nWait, but average age is 7, so some buses are older than 7, some are younger.\n\nIf they've been replacing buses at a constant rate, then the number of buses reaching 15 years each year would be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of depreciation.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet's go back to the initial approach.\n\nCurrent fleet: 100 buses, average age 7 years, lifespan 15 years.\n\nThey want to increase the fleet by 20% over 5 years, meaning they want to have 120 buses at the end of 5 years.\n\nNow, during these 5 years, some buses will reach the end of their lifespan and need to be replaced, and others will need to be added for expansion.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of buses that need to be replaced over 5 years.\n\nIf the average age is 7 years, and lifespans are 15 years, then the fraction of buses that need to be replaced each year is 1/15.\n\nSo, annually, they need to replace 100/15 \u2248 6.67 buses.\n\nOver 5 years, that's 6.67 * 5 \u2248 33.33 buses.\n\nAdditionally, they need to add 20 buses for expansion.\n\nTherefore, total new buses needed over 5 years: 33.33 + 20 \u2248 53.33 buses.\n\nDivided by 5 years, that's about 10.67 buses per year.\n\nSo, they need to purchase approximately 11 buses per year to meet both replacement and expansion needs.\n\nBut to be more precise, perhaps I should consider that the number of buses needing replacement increases or decreases based on the current age distribution.\n\nHowever, without specific data on the age distribution, assuming a constant replacement rate is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this with a simple equation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Current fleet size: 100 buses\n\n- Average age: 7 years\n\n- Lifespan: 15 years\n\n- Desired expansion: 20% over 5 years, i.e., to 120 buses\n\n- Time period: 5 years\n\nLet\u2019s define the number of buses to purchase each year as x.\n\nEach year, some buses reach the end of their lifespan and need to be replaced.\n\nAs above, the number of buses to replace each year is approximately 100/15 = 6.67.\n\nBut as the fleet size increases over time, the number of buses to replace each year will also increase.\n\nWait, that's an important point.\n\nIf they are adding new buses each year, those new buses will also reach the end of their lifespan in 15 years, but since the time frame is only 5 years, none of the new buses will need replacement within this period.\n\nTherefore, the number of buses to replace each year remains based on the original fleet.\n\nSo, annually, they need to replace approximately 100/15 \u2248 6.67 buses.\n\nAdditionally, to reach 120 buses in 5 years, they need to add 20 buses over 5 years, which is 4 buses per year.\n\nTherefore, total new buses to purchase each year: replacements + expansions = 6.67 + 4 \u2248 10.67 buses.\n\nRounding up, that's about 11 buses per year.\n\nBut perhaps I should set up an equation to model this more accurately.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of buses at the beginning: 100.\n\nEach year, they purchase x buses and replace y buses.\n\nBut actually, replacements are for buses that are 15 years old.\n\nGiven the average age is 7 years, and lifespans are 15 years, perhaps a better approach is to consider the fleet size over time, accounting for both additions and replacements.\n\nLet\u2019s try to model the fleet size at the end of 5 years.\n\nStarting with 100 buses.\n\nEach year, they add x new buses and replace z buses.\n\nBut since the lifespan is 15 years, replacements are for buses that are 15 years old.\n\nGiven the average age is 7, assuming a uniform age distribution, the number of buses reaching 15 years each year is 100/15 \u2248 6.67.\n\nTherefore, z \u2248 6.67.\n\nSo, each year, the net increase in fleet size is x - z.\n\nOver 5 years, the fleet size will increase by 5*(x - z).\n\nThey want the fleet size to be 120 at the end of 5 years, starting from 100.\n\nTherefore, 100 + 5*(x - z) = 120.\n\nSo, 5*(x - z) = 20.\n\nTherefore, x - z = 4.\n\nGiven z \u2248 6.67, then x = 4 + 6.67 \u2248 10.67.\n\nAgain, this suggests they need to purchase about 11 buses per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the fleet size year by year to account for any changes in the number of replacements.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nYear 0: 100 buses.\n\nEach year, they add x buses and replace z buses.\n\nz is the number of buses that are 15 years old that need replacement.\n\nAssuming they've been replacing buses consistently, z \u2248 100/15 \u2248 6.67.\n\nBut to make it simpler, let's assume z = 7 buses per year.\n\nThen, net addition per year: x - 7.\n\nOver 5 years, net addition: 5*(x - 7) = 20.\n\nTherefore, x - 7 = 4 \u21d2 x = 11 buses per year.\n\nSo, they need to purchase 11 buses each year for 5 years.\n\nBut let's check this.\n\nStarting with 100 buses.\n\nEach year, add 11 buses, replace 7 buses (assuming 7 reach 15 years).\n\nSo, net addition per year: 11 - 7 = 4 buses.\n\nOver 5 years: 5*4 = 20 buses.\n\nTherefore, fleet size at the end of 5 years: 100 + 20 = 120 buses, which matches the goal.\n\nTherefore, purchasing 11 buses per year should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, if they purchase fewer buses some years and more others, as long as the total over 5 years is 55 buses, and accounting for replacements, they should reach the target.\n\nBut for simplicity, a constant purchase rate of 11 buses per year works.\n\nTherefore, the city needs to purchase approximately 11 buses per year over the next five years to meet both replacement and expansion requirements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
