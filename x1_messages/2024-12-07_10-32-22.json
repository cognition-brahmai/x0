        "content": "Let's see. So, the factory originally produces 1200 units per day and operates for 20 days in a month. That means the total monthly production is 1200 units/day * 20 days = 24,000 units.\n\nNow, if the factory starts operating for 25 days in a month, while keeping the daily production the same, the new monthly production would be 1200 units/day * 25 days = 30,000 units.\n\nTo find the percentage increase in production, I need to calculate how much more is produced in the new scenario compared to the old one, and then express that increase as a percentage of the original production.\n\nFirst, find the difference in production: 30,000 units - 24,000 units = 6,000 units.\n\nThen, to find the percentage increase, divide the increase by the original production and multiply by 100:\n\n(6,000 units / 24,000 units) * 100 = (0.25) * 100 = 25%.\n\nSo, the percentage increase in production is 25%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nOriginal production: 24,000 units.\n\nNew production: 30,000 units.\n\nDifference: 6,000 units.\n\nPercentage increase: (6,000 / 24,000) * 100 = 25%.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of the number of operating days. The factory increases its operating days from 20 to 25, which is an increase of 5 days.\n\nSo, the percentage increase in operating days is (5 days / 20 days) * 100 = 25%, which matches the percentage increase in production since daily production rate remains the same.\n\nThat gives me more confidence that the answer is indeed 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\%} \\]"
