        "content": "So the original garden is 25 feet by 30 feet, and the owner wants to add 5 feet to both the length and the width. To find the new area, I need to first figure out what the new dimensions will be after the expansion.\n\nSo, the original length is 30 feet, and we're adding 5 feet to that. So, the new length will be 30 + 5 = 35 feet.\n\nSimilarly, the original width is 25 feet, and we're adding 5 feet to that as well. So, the new width will be 25 + 5 = 30 feet.\n\nNow, to find the area of a rectangle, I know that area equals length multiplied by width. So, with the new dimensions, the area should be 35 feet times 30 feet.\n\nLet me calculate that: 35 times 30.\n\nWell, 30 times 30 is 900, and 5 times 30 is 150. So, adding those together, 900 plus 150 equals 1050.\n\nTherefore, the new area of the garden after the expansion will be 1050 square feet.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nI recall that when you increase both the length and the width by the same amount, you can think of it as adding the original area plus the areas of the additions.\n\nSo, the original area is 25 times 30, which is 750 square feet.\n\nThen, adding 5 feet to the length adds a strip of 5 feet by 30 feet, which is 150 square feet.\n\nAdding 5 feet to the width adds a strip of 5 feet by 25 feet, which is 125 square feet.\n\nBut wait, if I just add those two strips, that would be 150 plus 125 equals 275 square feet, and adding that to the original area of 750 would give me 1025 square feet.\n\nHold on, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Earlier, I got 1050 square feet, but now I'm getting 1025 square feet. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nI think I see the problem. When I add 5 feet to both the length and the width, I'm not just adding the two strips; I'm also adding the area where those two additions overlap, which is a square of 5 feet by 5 feet.\n\nSo, the total addition should be the two strips plus that overlapping square.\n\nSo, the area addition is: 150 (from the length strip) plus 125 (from the width strip) plus 25 (from the 5x5 square), which totals 150 + 125 + 25 = 300 square feet.\n\nAdding that to the original area of 750 square feet gives me 1050 square feet.\n\nAh, that matches my first calculation. So, the correct new area is indeed 1050 square feet.\n\nI think the mistake in the second approach was that I initially forgot to add the area of the overlapping square portion, which is the extra 25 square feet that brought the total addition to 300 square feet, resulting in the correct new area of 1050 square feet.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider that the new dimensions are increased by 5 feet each, so the new length is original length plus 5, and new width is original width plus 5.\n\nSo, new area is (original length + 5) times (original width + 5).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (30 + 5) times (25 + 5), which is 35 times 30, as I did initially.\n\nCalculating 35 times 30 is straightforward: 30 times 30 is 900, and 5 times 30 is 150, so total is 1050 square feet.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of the formula for the area of a rectangle with increased dimensions.\n\nLet me see: if the original length is L and the original width is W, and both are increased by X feet, then the new area A' is (L + X)(W + X).\n\nExpanding that, A' = L*W + L*X + W*X + X^2.\n\nSo, in this case, L is 30, W is 25, and X is 5.\n\nSo, A' = 30*25 + 30*5 + 25*5 + 5*5 = 750 + 150 + 125 + 25 = 1050 square feet.\n\nAgain, confirming the same result.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the new area is indeed 1050 square feet.\n\nPerhaps to further verify, I can calculate the difference between the new area and the original area and see if it makes sense.\n\nOriginal area: 25 ft * 30 ft = 750 sq ft.\n\nNew area: 30 ft * 35 ft = 1050 sq ft.\n\nDifference: 1050 - 750 = 300 sq ft.\n\nNow, the additions are:\n\n- A strip of 5 ft by 30 ft = 150 sq ft.\n\n- A strip of 5 ft by 25 ft = 125 sq ft.\n\n- And a square of 5 ft by 5 ft = 25 sq ft.\n\nTotal additions: 150 + 125 + 25 = 300 sq ft, which matches the difference.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the new area of the garden after expanding both the length and width by 5 feet each will be 1050 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1050} \\]"
