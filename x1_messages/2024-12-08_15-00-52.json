        "content": "So, if a car's gas tank holds 15 gallons and it gets an average of 25 miles per gallon, right? I need to find out how many miles the car can travel on a full tank.\n\nOkay, so first, I should understand what \"miles per gallon\" means. It's a measure of fuel efficiency, telling us how many miles the car can travel using one gallon of gas. In this case, it's 25 miles per gallon.\n\nSo, if the car can travel 25 miles on one gallon, then on 15 gallons, it should be able to travel 15 times that amount.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nMiles per gallon = 25\n\nNumber of gallons = 15\n\nTotal miles = miles per gallon \u00d7 number of gallons\n\nSo, total miles = 25 \u00d7 15\n\nNow, what's 25 multiplied by 15?\n\nWell, 25 times 10 is 250, and 25 times 5 is 125. So, 250 plus 125 equals 375.\n\nTherefore, the car can travel 375 miles on a full tank.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the car gets 25 miles per gallon, and there are 15 gallons in the tank, then 25 times 15 should indeed be 375.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the car can travel 25 miles for each of the 15 gallons, so it's 15 sets of 25 miles.\n\nSo, 15 \u00d7 25 = 375 miles.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total capacity and the rate of consumption.\n\nThe car consumes 1 gallon per 25 miles, so for 15 gallons, it can go 375 miles.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Maybe the efficiency changes with different driving conditions, but since it's given as an average, I think 375 miles is the answer.\n\nSo, the car can travel 375 miles on a full tank.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]"
