        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: if I flip a coin three times, what's the chance I'll get exactly two heads? Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times. Each flip has two possible results: heads (H) or tails (T). So, for three flips, the total number of possible sequences should be 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, which is 8. So, there are 8 possible outcomes in total.\n\nLet me list them out to visualize it better:\n\n1. HHH\n\n2. HHT\n\n3. HTH\n\n4. HTT\n\n5. THH\n\n6. THT\n\n7. TTH\n\n8. TTT\n\nOkay, so those are all the possible sequences of three coin flips.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these sequences have exactly two heads. Let's look at the list:\n\n1. HHH \u2013 that's three heads, not two.\n\n2. HHT \u2013 that's two heads and one tail.\n\n3. HTH \u2013 that's also two heads and one tail.\n\n4. HTT \u2013 that's one head and two tails.\n\n5. THH \u2013 two heads and one tail.\n\n6. THT \u2013 one head and two tails.\n\n7. TTH \u2013 one head and two tails.\n\n8. TTT \u2013 no heads, all tails.\n\nSo, from the list, the sequences with exactly two heads are HHT, HTH, and THH. That's three sequences.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 3, and the total number of possible outcomes is 8.\n\nProbability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, it should be 3/8.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that there's also a formula for this kind of problem, called the binomial probability formula. Let me recall that.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = (n choose k) \u00d7 p^k \u00d7 (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 3 coin flips),\n\n- k is the number of successful trials (exactly 2 heads),\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (for a fair coin, p = 0.5 for heads),\n\n- \"n choose k\" is the binomial coefficient, which is n! / (k!(n-k)!).\n\nLet me apply this formula to verify my earlier result.\n\nFirst, calculate \"n choose k\":\n\nn = 3, k = 2\n\nSo, \"3 choose 2\" = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1) = 3.\n\nThen, p^k = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.\n\nAnd, (1-p)^(n-k) = (0.5)^(3-2) = (0.5)^1 = 0.5.\n\nNow, multiply them all together:\n\nP(2) = 3 \u00d7 0.25 \u00d7 0.5 = 3 \u00d7 0.125 = 0.375.\n\nBut 0.375 is the same as 3/8.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the concept of independent events.\n\nEach coin flip is independent, and the probability of getting heads or tails on each flip is 0.5.\n\nTo get exactly two heads in three flips, I can have the following sequences:\n\n1. HHT\n\n2. HTH\n\n3. THH\n\nEach of these sequences has two heads and one tail.\n\nSince the flips are independent, the probability of each sequence is:\n\nP(HHT) = P(H) \u00d7 P(H) \u00d7 P(T) = 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.125\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(HTH) = 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.125\n\nP(THH) = 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.125\n\nNow, since these are mutually exclusive events (they can't happen at the same time), I can add their probabilities to get the total probability of getting exactly two heads.\n\nSo, total probability = 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.375, which is again 3/8.\n\nAlright, so no matter which method I use, I keep getting 3/8 as the probability.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, does the order matter? In coin flips, typically, the order of heads and tails matters, but in this case, since we're only interested in the number of heads, the order doesn't matter as long as there are exactly two heads.\n\nBut in probability calculations, we do consider the sequences as distinct outcomes, each with their own probability.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 heads out of 3 flips is \"3 choose 2\", which is 3, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAnd since each flip is independent with a probability of 0.5 for heads, the probability is indeed 3 \u00d7 (0.5)^2 \u00d7 (0.5)^1 = 3/8.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I've used multiple methods to confirm the answer, and they all point to 3/8.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the coin is fair. In this problem, it's implied that it's a fair coin, meaning the probability of heads and tails is equal, i.e., 0.5 each.\n\nIf the coin were unfair, say with a probability p of heads, then the formula would be P(k) = (n choose k) \u00d7 p^k \u00d7 (1-p)^(n-k), as I used earlier.\n\nBut since it's a fair coin, p = 0.5, and we get P(2) = 3/8.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider for this problem. It seems straightforward once I break it down into these steps.\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly two heads in three coin flips is 3/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}} \\]"
