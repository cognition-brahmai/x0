The factory produces 250 units every day, and I need to find out how many units are produced in a week, which is 7 days.\n\nSo, I think I just need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week. That is, 250 units/day times 7 days.\n\nLet me do the math: 250 times 7.\n\nWell, 250 times 5 is 1,250, and 250 times 2 is 500. So, 1,250 plus 500 equals 1,750.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 250 times 10 is 2,500, and half of that is 1,250, which is 250 times 5. Then, 250 times 2 is 500. So, adding 1,250 and 500 gives me 1,750.\n\nHmm, but I feel like I might be making a mistake. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the factory produces 250 units each day, then over 7 days, it would produce 250 units per day multiplied by 7 days.\n\nSo, 250 \u00d7 7.\n\nI can break it down further: 200 times 7 is 1,400, and 50 times 7 is 350. Adding those together, 1,400 plus 350 equals 1,750.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the factory produces 1,750 units in a week.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me check again. 250 units per day for 7 days: 250 \u00d7 7.\n\n250 \u00d7 7 is indeed 1,750.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1750} \\]"
