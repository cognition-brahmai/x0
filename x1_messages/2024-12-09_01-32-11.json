        "content": "So I have this problem here: a baker uses 3 eggs to make 12 cupcakes, and I need to find out how many eggs he uses to make 60 cupcakes. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many eggs are used per cupcake. If 3 eggs make 12 cupcakes, then the number of eggs per cupcake is 3 divided by 12. That is, 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4. So, each cupcake requires 1/4 of an egg.\n\nNow, if each cupcake needs 1/4 egg, then for 60 cupcakes, I would multiply 60 by 1/4. That is, 60 * (1/4) = 15 eggs.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using proportions. If 12 cupcakes require 3 eggs, then 60 cupcakes would require x eggs. So, I can set up a proportion: 12 cupcakes / 3 eggs = 60 cupcakes / x eggs.\n\nCross-multiplying, I get 12x = 3 * 60, which is 12x = 180. Then, x = 180 / 12, which is x = 15 eggs.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It looks like the baker uses 15 eggs to make 60 cupcakes.\n\nBut let me double-check. If 3 eggs make 12 cupcakes, then to make 60 cupcakes, which is 5 times more (since 60 / 12 = 5), he would need 5 times more eggs. So, 3 eggs * 5 = 15 eggs. Yep, that makes sense too.\n\nSo, the answer should be 15 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
