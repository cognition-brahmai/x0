        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's implement the Quicksort algorithm in JavaScript and see it in action on an array of numbers.\n\nFirst, I'll explain what Quicksort is. Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how Quicksort works:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot element** from the array. This can be any element, but common choices are the first element, the last element, or the middle element. For simplicity, we'll choose the last element as the pivot.\n\n2. **Partition the array** such that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply** the above steps to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and to the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.\n\nNow, let's write the JavaScript code for Quicksort.\n\n```javascript\nfunction quicksort(arr, low, high) {\n    if (low < high) {\n        // Partition the array and get the pivot index\n        let pi = partition(arr, low, high);\n\n        // Recursively sort elements before and after partition\n        quicksort(arr, low, pi - 1);\n        quicksort(arr, pi + 1, high);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction partition(arr, low, high) {\n    // Choose the last element as pivot\n    let pivot = arr[high];\n\n    // Pointer for the greater element\n    let i = low - 1;\n\n    // Traverse through all elements\n    // Compare each element with pivot\n    for (let j = low; j < high; j++) {\n        if (arr[j] < pivot) {\n            // If element smaller than pivot is found\n            // swap it with the greater element pointed by i\n            i++;\n            [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Swap the pivot element with the element at i+1\n    [arr[i + 1], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[i + 1]];\n\n    // Return the position from where partition is done\n    return i + 1;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet array = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5];\nlet n = array.length;\nquicksort(array, 0, n - 1);\nconsole.log(\"Sorted array is:\");\nconsole.log(array);\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Quicksort Function**:\n   - This is the main function that implements the Quicksort algorithm.\n   - It takes an array `arr` and the indices `low` and `high` that define the portion of the array to be sorted.\n   - If `low` is less than `high`, it calls the `partition` function to get the pivot index and then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n\n2. **Partition Function**:\n   - This function takes the array and the indices `low` and `high`.\n   - It selects the last element as the pivot.\n   - It maintains a pointer `i` to track the position of the last element smaller than the pivot.\n   - As it iterates through the array from `low` to `high - 1`, it swaps elements smaller than the pivot to the front.\n   - Finally, it places the pivot in its correct position and returns this index.\n\n3. **Example Usage**:\n   - We define an array of numbers.\n   - We call the `quicksort` function with the array and the indices 0 and `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the array.\n   - After sorting, we print the sorted array.\n\nThis implementation should work for most cases, but keep in mind that Quicksort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n\u00b2), which occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot. However, on average, it performs at O(n log n), making it efficient for sorting large datasets.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!"
