        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. So, the car rental company wants to replace 10% of their 200 gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles (EVs). First, I need to figure out how many cars that is.\n\n10% of 200 cars is 20 cars. So, they're planning to replace 20 gasoline cars with EVs.\n\nEach EV costs $40,000, so the total cost for 20 EVs would be:\n\n20 EVs * $40,000/EV = $800,000\n\nNow, they can sell their used gasoline cars for $15,000 each. So, from selling 20 gasoline cars, they would get:\n\n20 cars * $15,000/car = $300,000\n\nTherefore, the initial investment required would be the cost of the EVs minus the money they get from selling the gasoline cars:\n\n$800,000 - $300,000 = $500,000\n\nThat's the initial out-of-pocket cost for the transition.\n\nNext, let's estimate the potential savings in fuel costs over one year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual fuel cost for the gasoline cars that are being replaced.\n\nEach gasoline car consumes 2 gallons per day, and gas costs $3.00 per gallon. So, daily fuel cost per gasoline car is:\n\n2 gallons/day * $3.00/gallon = $6.00/day\n\nAnnual fuel cost per gasoline car is:\n\n$6.00/day * 365 days/year = $2,190/year\n\nSince 20 cars are being replaced, the total annual fuel cost for these 20 gasoline cars would be:\n\n20 cars * $2,190/car/year = $43,800/year\n\nNow, let's calculate the annual electricity cost for the 20 EVs.\n\nEach EV consumes $0.04 worth of electricity per mile, and travels an average of 100 miles per day. So, daily electricity cost per EV is:\n\n100 miles/day * $0.04/mile = $4.00/day\n\nAnnual electricity cost per EV is:\n\n$4.00/day * 365 days/year = $1,460/year\n\nFor 20 EVs, the total annual electricity cost would be:\n\n20 EVs * $1,460/EV/year = $29,200/year\n\nNow, the potential savings in fuel costs would be the difference between the annual fuel cost of the gasoline cars and the annual electricity cost of the EVs:\n\n$43,800/year - $29,200/year = $14,600/year\n\nSo, by replacing 20 gasoline cars with EVs, the company can save $14,600 per year in fuel costs.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure we're considering all the costs. Are there any other costs associated with EVs that might impact the savings? For example, maintenance costs, charging infrastructure costs, etc. The question doesn't mention any additional costs, so I'll assume that the only costs we need to consider are the initial purchase price of the EVs, the sale price of the gasoline cars, and the fuel costs.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that the savings calculated here are purely based on fuel costs. There might be other benefits to switching to EVs, such as environmental benefits, potential tax incentives, or improvements in the company's image. However, since the question only asks for fuel cost savings, I'll stick to that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the lifespan of the vehicles. If the gasoline cars were nearing the end of their useful life, the company might have to replace them soon anyway. In that case, the initial investment might be lower because they would have to buy new gasoline cars eventually. But since they're replacing them with EVs now, the difference in cost would be the initial investment required.\n\nBut in this scenario, since they're replacing 10% of their fleet now, and assuming the remaining 90% is still operational, I'll stick with the calculations above.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Initial investment required: $500,000\n\n- Annual fuel cost savings: $14,600\n\nNow, if the company wants to understand how long it would take to recover the initial investment through fuel cost savings, they could calculate the payback period.\n\nPayback period = initial investment / annual savings\n\n$500,000 / $14,600/year \u2248 34.25 years\n\nThat seems like a very long payback period. Is that realistic? Maybe not, which suggests that there might be some missing pieces in this calculation.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider other factors that could reduce the payback period. For example, if the EVs have lower maintenance costs, that could add to the savings. Alternatively, there might be government subsidies or tax incentives for purchasing EVs that could reduce the initial investment.\n\nSince the question doesn't provide information on these aspects, I'll have to assume that the only cost savings come from fuel costs.\n\nAnother factor could be the difference in resale value between EVs and gasoline cars. If EVs hold their value better, the company might get more money back when they sell the EVs in the future. But again, without specific information, it's hard to factor that in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company is considering the environmental benefits and is willing to accept a longer payback period for the sake of reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company expects fuel prices to rise in the future, which would increase the savings from switching to EVs.\n\nBut based on the information provided, the payback period seems quite long.\n\nMaybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's recalculate the initial investment:\n\nCost of 20 EVs: 20 * $40,000 = $800,000\n\nRevenue from selling 20 gasoline cars: 20 * $15,000 = $300,000\n\nInitial investment: $800,000 - $300,000 = $500,000\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, annual fuel cost for 20 gasoline cars:\n\n2 gallons/day * $3.00/gallon * 20 cars * 365 days/year = 2 * 3 * 20 * 365 = $43,800/year\n\nAnnual electricity cost for 20 EVs:\n\n$4.00/day * 20 EVs * 365 days/year = $4 * 20 * 365 = $29,200/year\n\nSavings: $43,800 - $29,200 = $14,600/year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $14,600 \u2248 34.25 years\n\nHmm, that does seem too long. Maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm calculating the fuel costs.\n\nLet me check the fuel consumption for gasoline cars again.\n\nEach gasoline car consumes 2 gallons per day at $3.00 per gallon.\n\nSo, daily cost per car: 2 * $3 = $6\n\nAnnual cost per car: $6 * 365 = $2,190\n\nTotal for 20 cars: $2,190 * 20 = $43,800\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, for EVs:\n\nEach EV consumes $0.04 worth of electricity per mile, traveling 100 miles per day.\n\nDaily electricity cost per EV: 100 * $0.04 = $4\n\nAnnual electricity cost per EV: $4 * 365 = $1,460\n\nTotal for 20 EVs: $1,460 * 20 = $29,200\n\nSavings: $43,800 - $29,200 = $14,600 per year\n\nInitial investment: $500,000\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $14,600 \u2248 34.25 years\n\nThis suggests that, based on fuel costs alone, it would take over 34 years to recover the initial investment. That seems prohibitive.\n\nPerhaps the company should consider other factors, such as maintenance costs, which might be lower for EVs, or potential increases in gas prices, which could increase savings over time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company is looking at this from a different perspective, such as environmental impact or meeting regulatory requirements, where cost savings are secondary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers provided in the question are not accurate, or there are mistakes in the assumptions.\n\nFor example, maybe the cost of EVs has been decreasing, and $40,000 is higher than the current market price. Or perhaps the resale value of gasoline cars is lower than $15,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the electricity cost per mile for EVs is lower than $0.04.\n\nLet me see what the actual cost per mile for EVs is.\n\nAccording to some sources, the cost per mile for EVs can be as low as $0.01-$0.02 per mile, depending on electricity rates.\n\nIn the question, it's given as $0.04 per mile, which seems a bit high.\n\nIf I assume a lower cost per mile, say $0.02 per mile, then:\n\nDaily electricity cost per EV: 100 miles * $0.02/mile = $2\n\nAnnual electricity cost per EV: $2 * 365 = $730\n\nTotal for 20 EVs: $730 * 20 = $14,600\n\nThen, savings would be $43,800 (gasoline) - $14,600 (electricity) = $29,200 per year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $29,200 \u2248 17.12 years\n\nStill quite long, but better than 34 years.\n\nAlternatively, if the cost per mile is $0.01, then:\n\nDaily electricity cost per EV: 100 * $0.01 = $1\n\nAnnual electricity cost per EV: $1 * 365 = $365\n\nTotal for 20 EVs: $365 * 20 = $7,300\n\nSavings: $43,800 - $7,300 = $36,500 per year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $36,500 \u2248 13.69 years\n\nStill a long payback period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company can get government subsidies for purchasing EVs, which would reduce the initial investment.\n\nFor example, if there's a $10,000 subsidy per EV, then:\n\nTotal cost for 20 EVs: 20 * $40,000 = $800,000\n\nSubsidy: 20 * $10,000 = $200,000\n\nNet cost: $800,000 - $200,000 = $600,000\n\nMinus the $300,000 from selling gasoline cars:\n\nInitial investment: $600,000 - $300,000 = $300,000\n\nWith savings of $14,600 per year, payback period would be:\n\n$300,000 / $14,600 \u2248 20.55 years\n\nStill quite long.\n\nAlternatively, if the company can get higher resale value for the gasoline cars, say $18,000 each:\n\nRevenue from selling 20 gasoline cars: 20 * $18,000 = $360,000\n\nInitial investment: $800,000 - $360,000 = $440,000\n\nPayback period: $440,000 / $14,600 \u2248 29.99 years\n\nStill over 29 years.\n\nAlternatively, if the company can negotiate a better price for the EVs, say $35,000 each:\n\nTotal cost for 20 EVs: 20 * $35,000 = $700,000\n\nMinus $300,000 from selling gasoline cars:\n\nInitial investment: $700,000 - $300,000 = $400,000\n\nPayback period: $400,000 / $14,600 \u2248 27.40 years\n\nStill a long time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company can utilize the EVs more efficiently, leading to higher usage and potentially higher savings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company is considering the environmental benefits and is willing to accept a longer payback period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company is looking at future fuel price increases, which would increase the savings over time.\n\nFor example, if gas prices increase to $4.00 per gallon in the next few years, the fuel cost for gasoline cars would increase.\n\nLet's assume gas prices rise to $4.00 per gallon.\n\nDaily fuel cost per gasoline car: 2 gallons * $4.00 = $8.00\n\nAnnual fuel cost per gasoline car: $8.00 * 365 = $2,920\n\nTotal for 20 cars: $2,920 * 20 = $58,400\n\nElectricity cost remains the same: $29,200\n\nSavings: $58,400 - $29,200 = $29,200 per year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $29,200 \u2248 17.12 years\n\nStill long, but better.\n\nAlternatively, if gas prices rise to $5.00 per gallon:\n\nDaily fuel cost per gasoline car: 2 * $5 = $10\n\nAnnual fuel cost per car: $10 * 365 = $3,650\n\nTotal for 20 cars: $3,650 * 20 = $73,000\n\nSavings: $73,000 - $29,200 = $43,800 per year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $43,800 \u2248 11.41 years\n\nThat's more reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if both gas prices rise and electricity costs decrease, the savings could be even greater.\n\nFor example, if gas prices are $5.00 per gallon and electricity cost is $0.02 per mile:\n\nElectricity cost for 20 EVs: 20 * 100 miles/day * $0.02/mile * 365 days = 20 * 100 * 0.02 * 365 = $14,600 per year\n\nFuel cost for 20 gasoline cars: $73,000 per year\n\nSavings: $73,000 - $14,600 = $58,400 per year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $58,400 \u2248 8.56 years\n\nThat's much better.\n\nAlternatively, if the company can utilize the EVs for higher mileage, say 150 miles per day, the savings might increase further.\n\nBut this is getting speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company should consider a smaller initial investment, replacing fewer cars, and see how it goes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other cost savings not considered here, such as maintenance costs being lower for EVs.\n\nIf maintenance costs for EVs are, say, $500 less per year per vehicle than gasoline cars, then:\n\nAnnual maintenance savings per EV: $500\n\nTotal annual maintenance savings for 20 EVs: $500 * 20 = $10,000\n\nAdding this to the fuel cost savings:\n\nIf gas prices are $3.00 per gallon, fuel savings are $14,600, plus maintenance savings of $10,000, total savings: $24,600 per year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $24,600 \u2248 20.32 years\n\nStill long.\n\nIf gas prices are $5.00 per gallon, fuel savings are $43,800, plus maintenance savings of $10,000, total savings: $53,800 per year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $53,800 \u2248 9.29 years\n\nThat's more acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company can get rid of some maintenance staff or reduce maintenance facilities due to EVs requiring less maintenance, leading to additional savings.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company can charge customers more for renting EVs, as they might be in demand.\n\nIf the company can charge an additional $5 per day per EV, and assuming the EVs are rented out every day:\n\nAdditional revenue per EV per year: $5/day * 365 days = $1,825\n\nTotal additional revenue for 20 EVs: $1,825 * 20 = $36,500 per year\n\nAdding this to the savings:\n\nIf gas prices are $3.00 per gallon, total savings plus additional revenue: $14,600 + $36,500 = $51,100 per year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $51,100 \u2248 9.78 years\n\nIf gas prices are $5.00 per gallon, total savings plus additional revenue: $43,800 + $36,500 = $80,300 per year\n\nPayback period: $500,000 / $80,300 \u2248 6.22 years\n\nThat's quite attractive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company can get government grants or incentives for promoting EV usage, which could further reduce the initial investment or provide additional annual savings.\n\nGiven all these considerations, it seems that while the initial payback period based solely on fuel costs is long, considering other factors such as potential increases in gas prices, lower maintenance costs, and additional revenue from charging higher rental rates for EVs, the payback period can be significantly reduced.\n\nTherefore, the company might find it worthwhile to proceed with the transition, especially if they can reasonably expect some of these additional benefits.\n\nAlternatively, they could perform a more detailed cost-benefit analysis, including all potential costs and savings, to get a better estimate of the payback period and make an informed decision.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the initial calculations, the payback period is long, but considering additional factors, it can be reduced to a more acceptable range. The company should consider these factors and possibly conduct a more thorough analysis before making a decision.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500000 \\text{ initial investment with potential annual savings varying based on assumptions}} \\]"
