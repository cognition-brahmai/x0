        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a group of people, and here's what we know:\n\n1. 60% of the group is wearing glasses.\n\n2. Of those wearing glasses, 40% have brown hair.\n\n3. There are 24 people who have both brown hair and glasses.\n\nWe need to find out how many people are in the group altogether.\n\nFirst, let's try to visualize this with a diagram or just think about it logically.\n\nLet's denote the total number of people in the group as T.\n\nAccording to the information:\n\n- 60% of T are wearing glasses. So, the number of people wearing glasses is 0.60 * T.\n\n- Now, of these people wearing glasses, 40% have brown hair. So, the number of people with both glasses and brown hair is 0.40 * (0.60 * T).\n\nAnd we're told that this number is 24.\n\nSo, we can set up an equation:\n\n0.40 * (0.60 * T) = 24\n\nNow, let's solve for T.\n\nFirst, multiply 0.40 by 0.60:\n\n0.40 * 0.60 = 0.24\n\nSo, 0.24 * T = 24\n\nNow, to find T, divide both sides by 0.24:\n\nT = 24 / 0.24\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n24 divided by 0.24 is the same as 24 divided by (24/100), which is 24 * (100/24) = 100.\n\nSo, T = 100.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf T = 100,\n\n- 60% of 100 are wearing glasses: 0.60 * 100 = 60 people.\n\n- 40% of those wearing glasses have brown hair: 0.40 * 60 = 24 people.\n\nAnd that matches the given number of 24 people with both brown hair and glasses.\n\nSo, the total number of people in the group is 100.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to think in terms of proportions.\n\nWe know that 40% of the glass-wearers have brown hair, and that amounts to 24 people.\n\nSo, 40% corresponds to 24 people.\n\nTo find the total number of glass-wearers, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.40 * G = 24\n\nWhere G is the number of people wearing glasses.\n\nSolving for G:\n\nG = 24 / 0.40\n\nG = 60\n\nSo, there are 60 people wearing glasses.\n\nNow, since glasses-wearers make up 60% of the total group, we can set up another equation:\n\n0.60 * T = 60\n\nSolving for T:\n\nT = 60 / 0.60\n\nT = 100\n\nAgain, we get the total number of people in the group as 100.\n\nLet's consider if there's any other way to interpret the information.\n\nIs there any possibility that someone has brown hair but isn't wearing glasses? The problem doesn't specify anything about people without glasses having brown hair, so we can't make any assumptions about that. However, since the question only gives information about brown-haired people who are wearing glasses, and we're only asked for the total number of people, we don't need to worry about those who have brown hair but aren't wearing glasses.\n\nSo, our answer remains T = 100.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's plug the number back into the original conditions.\n\n- 60% of 100 are wearing glasses: 0.60 * 100 = 60.\n\n- 40% of these 60 have brown hair: 0.40 * 60 = 24.\n\nWhich matches the given information.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people in the group is 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
