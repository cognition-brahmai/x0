        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression we need to simplify is:\n\n6 / (2 * (3 - 1)) + 4^2 - 5 * 3\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the order of operations. I think it's PEMDAS or something like that. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, I'll follow that.\n\nStarting with parentheses:\n\nThere are two sets of parentheses here: (3 - 1) and the outer (2 * (3 - 1)). Let's solve the innermost parentheses first.\n\n3 - 1 = 2\n\nSo, now the expression becomes:\n\n6 / (2 * 2) + 4^2 - 5 * 3\n\nNext, within the parentheses, we have 2 * 2:\n\n2 * 2 = 4\n\nSo now, the expression is:\n\n6 / 4 + 4^2 - 5 * 3\n\nAlright, next are exponents:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n6 / 4 + 16 - 5 * 3\n\nNext, multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst, 6 / 4:\n\n6 divided by 4 is 1.5\n\nSo now it's:\n\n1.5 + 16 - 5 * 3\n\nNext, 5 * 3:\n\n5 * 3 = 15\n\nSo now, the expression is:\n\n1.5 + 16 - 15\n\nFinally, addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n1.5 + 16 = 17.5\n\nThen, 17.5 - 15 = 2.5\n\nSo, the simplified result of the expression is 2.5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me look at the original expression again: 6 / (2 * (3 - 1)) + 4^2 - 5 * 3\n\nI think I handled the parentheses correctly, and the exponents too. The multiplication and division were done from left to right, and same for addition and subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the division and multiplication as a single step.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nFirst, solve the inner parentheses: (3 - 1) = 2\n\nThen, the expression becomes: 6 / (2 * 2) + 4^2 - 5 * 3\n\nNow, 2 * 2 = 4, so 6 / 4 + 16 - 15\n\n6 divided by 4 is indeed 1.5, and then 1.5 + 16 is 17.5, minus 15 is 2.5.\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the division and multiplication as having equal precedence and solve from left to right.\n\nSo, 6 / 2 * 2.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 6 / (2 * (3 - 1)), so the parentheses clarify that it's 6 divided by the product of 2 and (3 - 1), which is 4, so 6 / 4 = 1.5.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, final answer should be 2.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5} \\]"
