        "content": "Alright, I'm going to design a simple vending machine program in Java. The vending machine will have five different products, each with its own price. Users can insert coins to purchase these products. If they don't insert enough money, the machine will ask for more coins. If they insert too much, it will give back the change.\n\nFirst, I need to plan out the structure of the program. I should probably create a class for the vending machine that holds information about the products and their prices. Each product can be represented by a simple class or just by a map or array.\n\nI'll need to handle coin insertion and keep track of the total amount inserted. Then, when the user selects a product, I can check if they've inserted enough money. If not, prompt for more coins. If they've inserted too much, calculate the change and return it.\n\nI should also consider the types of coins that the machine accepts. For simplicity, let's assume it accepts only standard coin denominations like 1, 5, 10, 25 cents.\n\nLet me start by defining the products. I'll create a list of products with their names and prices.\n\nProduct 1: Soda, $1.00\nProduct 2: Chips, $0.75\nProduct 3: Candy, $0.50\nProduct 4: Cookie, $0.60\nProduct 5: Juice, $0.80\n\nI'll store these in a map with product names as keys and prices as values.\n\nNext, I need to handle user input. The program should display the products and their prices, then ask the user to select a product by entering a number.\n\nAfter selecting the product, the program should ask the user to insert coins one by one until the total amount equals or exceeds the product's price.\n\nI need to keep track of the total amount inserted and inform the user how much more they need to insert if the amount is insufficient.\n\nOnce the amount is sufficient, I need to dispense the product and calculate the change if any.\n\nFor calculating change, I need to determine the smallest number of coins to return. For example, if the change is 35 cents, it should return one quarter, one dime.\n\nI should also consider that the machine has a finite number of each coin type for giving change, but to keep it simple, I'll assume the machine has an infinite supply of coins for change.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Display the products and their prices.\n\n2. Ask the user to select a product by entering a number (1-5).\n\n3. Based on the selection, set the price of the selected product.\n\n4. Ask the user to insert coins one by one.\n\n5. Keep a running total of the coins inserted.\n\n6. If the total is less than the product's price, display how much more is needed.\n\n7. If the total equals or exceeds the product's price, dispense the product.\n\n8. If the total exceeds the product's price, calculate and return the change.\n\nI need to handle invalid inputs, like entering a non-numeric character for product selection or inserting invalid coin denominations.\n\nFor coin insertion, I'll assume the user enters the coin value in cents (1, 5, 10, 25).\n\nI should also handle the case where the user enters 0 or a negative number, which should be invalid.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the classes.\n\nI can have a VendingMachine class that holds the products and handles the purchasing logic.\n\nI can have a Product class with name and price.\n\nIn the VendingMachine class, I'll have a map or list of products.\n\nI'll have methods to display products, select a product, insert coins, check if enough money is inserted, dispense the product, and calculate change.\n\nI need a main method to run the program and handle user input.\n\nI should use a loop to keep asking for coin insertion until the total is sufficient.\n\nFor calculating change, I need to make sure to give the least number of coins possible.\n\nI can implement a method that starts with the highest denomination and works its way down to the lowest.\n\nFor example, if the change is 45 cents, give one quarter, one dime, and one nickel.\n\nWait, but I'm assuming only standard US coins: 1, 5, 10, 25 cents.\n\nIn this case, for 45 cents, it would be one quarter and two dimes.\n\nI need to write a method that can calculate the number of each coin type to give back.\n\nI should also display the change to the user.\n\nOnce the purchase is complete, I can ask if the user wants to make another purchase.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this step by step.\n\nFirst, define the Product class:\n\nclass Product {\n\nString name;\n\ndouble price;\n\npublic Product(String name, double price) {\n\nthis.name = name;\n\nthis.price = price;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThen, in the VendingMachine class:\n\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class VendingMachine {\n\nprivate Map<Integer, Product> products;\n\nprivate double selectedProductPrice;\n\nprivate double insertedAmount;\n\npublic VendingMachine() {\n\nproducts = new HashMap<>();\n\nproducts.put(1, new Product(\"Soda\", 1.00));\n\nproducts.put(2, new Product(\"Chips\", 0.75));\n\nproducts.put(3, new Product(\"Candy\", 0.50));\n\nproducts.put(4, new Product(\"Cookie\", 0.60));\n\nproducts.put(5, new Product(\"Juice\", 0.80));\n\n}\n\npublic void displayProducts() {\n\nfor (Map.Entry<Integer, Product> entry : products.entrySet()) {\n\nint key = entry.getKey();\n\nProduct product = entry.getValue();\n\nSystem.out.println(key + \". \" + product.name + \" - $\" + product.price);\n\n}\n\n}\n\npublic void selectProduct(int selection) {\n\nProduct selectedProduct = products.get(selection);\n\nif (selectedProduct != null) {\n\nselectedProductPrice = selectedProduct.price;\n\nSystem.out.println(\"You selected \" + selectedProduct.name + \" for $\" + selectedProduct.price);\n\n} else {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Invalid selection. Please try again.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\npublic void insertCoin(int coin) {\n\nif (coin == 1 || coin == 5 || coin == 10 || coin == 25) {\n\ninsertedAmount += coin / 100.0; // convert cents to dollars\n\n} else {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Invalid coin. Please insert 1, 5, 10, or 25 cents.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\npublic boolean isEnoughMoney() {\n\nreturn insertedAmount >= selectedProductPrice;\n\n}\n\npublic void dispenseProduct() {\n\nif (isEnoughMoney()) {\n\ndouble change = insertedAmount - selectedProductPrice;\n\nif (change > 0) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Here's your change: $\" + change);\n\n// Optionally, calculate and display the exact coins for change\n\n} else {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"No change required.\");\n\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Dispensing your product. Enjoy!\");\n\n} else {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Insufficient funds. Please insert more coins.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nVendingMachine vm = new VendingMachine();\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nwhile (true) {\n\nvm.displayProducts();\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Select a product (1-5): \");\n\nint selection = scanner.nextInt();\n\nvm.selectProduct(selection);\n\nif (vm.selectedProductPrice > 0) {\n\nwhile (!vm.isEnoughMoney()) {\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Insert coin (1, 5, 10, 25 cents): \");\n\nint coin = scanner.nextInt();\n\nvm.insertCoin(coin);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Total inserted: $\" + vm.insertedAmount);\n\n}\n\nvm.dispenseProduct();\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nscanner.close();\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis is a basic implementation. I can improve it by handling multiple purchases, resetting the inserted amount after a purchase, and handling invalid inputs more gracefully.\n\nAlso, I should consider floating point precision when dealing with money, but for simplicity, I'll stick with double for now.\n\nI might want to add a method to calculate the exact change in coins.\n\nFor example, a method that takes the change amount in dollars and returns the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.\n\nThen, I can display the exact coins to the user.\n\nLet me add that method.\n\nHere's an updated version:\n\npublic class VendingMachine {\n\n// ... previous code ...\n\npublic void dispenseProduct() {\n\nif (isEnoughMoney()) {\n\ndouble change = insertedAmount - selectedProductPrice;\n\nif (change > 0) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Here's your change: $\" + change);\n\nMap<String, Integer> changeCoins = calculateChange(change);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Change breakdown:\");\n\nfor (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : changeCoins.entrySet()) {\n\nSystem.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue());\n\n}\n\n} else {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"No change required.\");\n\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Dispensing your product. Enjoy!\");\n\nresetTransaction();\n\n} else {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Insufficient funds. Please insert more coins.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nprivate void resetTransaction() {\n\nselectedProductPrice = 0;\n\ninsertedAmount = 0;\n\n}\n\nprivate Map<String, Integer> calculateChange(double change) {\n\nMap<String, Integer> coins = new HashMap<>();\n\nint cents = (int) (change * 100); // convert dollars to cents\n\nint quarters = cents / 25;\n\ncents %= 25;\n\nint dimes = cents / 10;\n\ncents %= 10;\n\nint nickels = cents / 5;\n\ncents %= 5;\n\nint pennies = cents;\n\ncoins.put(\"Quarters\", quarters);\n\ncoins.put(\"Dimes\", dimes);\n\ncoins.put(\"Nickels\", nickels);\n\ncoins.put(\"Pennies\", pennies);\n\nreturn coins;\n\n}\n\n// ... rest of the class ...\n\n}\n\nNow, the calculateChange method converts the change amount to cents and calculates the number of each coin type needed.\n\nIt then returns a map with the coin types and their counts.\n\nIn the dispenseProduct method, I display the change breakdown.\n\nAfter dispensing the product, I call resetTransaction to reset the selected product and inserted amount for the next transaction.\n\nI should also consider handling the case where the user selects an invalid product or inserts an invalid coin.\n\nAdditionally, I can add a loop in the main method to allow multiple purchases without restarting the program.\n\nHere's an improved version with a loop for multiple purchases:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nVendingMachine vm = new VendingMachine();\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nwhile (true) {\n\nvm.displayProducts();\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Select a product (1-5): \");\n\nint selection = scanner.nextInt();\n\nvm.selectProduct(selection);\n\nif (vm.selectedProductPrice > 0) {\n\nwhile (!vm.isEnoughMoney()) {\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Insert coin (1, 5, 10, 25 cents): \");\n\nint coin = scanner.nextInt();\n\nvm.insertCoin(coin);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Total inserted: $\" + df.format(vm.insertedAmount));\n\n}\n\nvm.dispenseProduct();\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Do you want to make another purchase? (yes/no): \");\n\nString response = scanner.next();\n\nif (!response.equalsIgnoreCase(\"yes\")) {\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nscanner.close();\n\n}\n\n}\n\nI added a DecimalFormat to format the dollars properly.\n\nAlso, after completing a purchase, I ask the user if they want to make another purchase. If they answer \"yes\", the loop continues; otherwise, it breaks.\n\nThis way, the program can handle multiple purchases in a row.\n\nI should also handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values for selection or coin insertion.\n\nTo handle that, I can use try-catch blocks to catch InputMismatchException and prompt the user to enter valid inputs.\n\nHere's how I can modify the main method to handle invalid inputs:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nVendingMachine vm = new VendingMachine();\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nwhile (true) {\n\nvm.displayProducts();\n\ntry {\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Select a product (1-5): \");\n\nint selection = scanner.nextInt();\n\nvm.selectProduct(selection);\n\nif (vm.selectedProductPrice > 0) {\n\nwhile (!vm.isEnoughMoney()) {\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Insert coin (1, 5, 10, 25 cents): \");\n\nint coin = scanner.nextInt();\n\nvm.insertCoin(coin);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Total inserted: $\" + df.format(vm.insertedAmount));\n\n}\n\nvm.dispenseProduct();\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Do you want to make another purchase? (yes/no): \");\n\nString response = scanner.next();\n\nif (!response.equalsIgnoreCase(\"yes\")) {\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n} catch (InputMismatchException e) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\");\n\nscanner.nextLine(); // clear the invalid input\n\n}\n\n}\n\nscanner.close();\n\n}\n\n}\n\nNow, if the user enters something other than a number, it will catch the exception, display an error message, and prompt again.\n\nThis should make the program more robust.\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements for simulating a vending machine in Java.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Java program that simulates a vending machine, we need to handle product selection, coin insertion, and change calculation. Below is a complete implementation that achieves this.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Product Class**: Represents the products with names and prices.\n2. **VendingMachine Class**: Manages the products, selected product, inserted amount, and transaction logic.\n3. **Main Method**: Handles user interactions, including product selection and coin insertion.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.text.DecimalFormat;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\nclass Product {\n    String name;\n    double price;\n\n    public Product(String name, double price) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.price = price;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class VendingMachine {\n    private Map<Integer, Product> products;\n    private double selectedProductPrice;\n    private double insertedAmount;\n\n    public VendingMachine() {\n        products = new HashMap<>();\n        products.put(1, new Product(\"Soda\", 1.00));\n        products.put(2, new Product(\"Chips\", 0.75));\n        products.put(3, new Product(\"Candy\", 0.50));\n        products.put(4, new Product(\"Cookie\", 0.60));\n        products.put(5, new Product(\"Juice\", 0.80));\n    }\n\n    public void displayProducts() {\n        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Product> entry : products.entrySet()) {\n            int key = entry.getKey();\n            Product product = entry.getValue();\n            System.out.println(key + \". \" + product.name + \" - $\" + product.price);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void selectProduct(int selection) {\n        Product selectedProduct = products.get(selection);\n        if (selectedProduct != null) {\n            selectedProductPrice = selectedProduct.price;\n            System.out.println(\"You selected \" + selectedProduct.name + \" for $\" + selectedProduct.price);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid selection.
