        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: If you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what's the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is equal to 7? Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that a fair six-sided die has sides numbered from 1 to 6, and each side has an equal chance of landing face up. Since I'm rolling the die twice, I need to consider all possible outcomes of these two rolls and then figure out how many of those outcomes add up to 7.\n\nI think the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die twice is 6 times 6, which is 36. That makes sense because for each roll, there are 6 possible results, and since the rolls are independent, I multiply them together to get the total number of outcomes.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 36 outcomes sum to 7. Let me list out the pairs of numbers that add up to 7:\n\n- 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, there are 6 possible pairs that sum to 7.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check my list to make sure I didn't miss any pairs.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If first roll is 1, second roll must be 6 to sum to 7.\n\n- If first roll is 2, second roll must be 5.\n\n- If first roll is 3, second roll must be 4.\n\n- If first roll is 4, second roll must be 3.\n\n- If first roll is 5, second roll must be 2.\n\n- If first roll is 6, second roll must be 1.\n\nThat's all the possibilities, right? No other combinations will give me a sum of 7.\n\nSo, yes, there are indeed 6 favorable outcomes.\n\nAnd the total number of possible outcomes is 36.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{6}{36}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that for any first roll, there's only one second roll that will make the sum equal to 7.\n\nFor example, if I roll a 3 first, I need a 4 on the second roll to make it 7.\n\nSince there are 6 possible first rolls, and for each one, there's exactly one second roll that makes the sum 7, that again gives me 6 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible ones.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of probability.\n\nThe probability of rolling any specific number on the first roll is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\), and similarly for the second roll.\n\nBut since the sum depends on both rolls, I need to consider their combined probabilities.\n\nWait, that might be getting a bit messy for this simple problem.\n\nI think my initial approach is solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the sample space.\n\nThe sample space for two rolls is all possible ordered pairs (first roll, second roll), like (1,1), (1,2), up to (6,6).\n\nOut of these 36 pairs, as I listed earlier, 6 of them sum to 7.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nI could also consider that in craps, a pair that sums to 7 is a common outcome, and intuitively, it makes sense that it would happen one-sixth of the time.\n\nBut just to be completely sure, let's consider if there's any overlap or if I'm double-counting.\n\nLooking back at my list:\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\nNo overlaps there; these are all distinct pairs.\n\nTherefore, my calculation holds.\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
