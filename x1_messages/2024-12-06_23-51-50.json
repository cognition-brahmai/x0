        "content": "So the baker uses 2 cups of flour for each loaf of bread, and he wants to bake 15 loaves. To find out how much flour he needs in total, I think I just need to multiply the amount of flour per loaf by the number of loaves he plans to bake.\n\nSo, that would be 2 cups per loaf times 15 loaves. Let's do the math:\n\n2 cups/loaf \u00d7 15 loaves = 30 cups\n\nSo, he needs 30 cups of flour in total.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check that. What if there's some other factor I'm missing? Like, does the baker need extra flour for handling or anything? The question seems straightforward, though. It says he uses 2 cups per loaf and wants to bake 15 loaves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider converting cups to another unit, like pounds or kilograms, but the question doesn't ask for that. It's fine to leave the answer in cups.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider if there's any flour waste or if the baker needs to reserve some flour for other purposes, but again, the question seems simple: just the flour needed for 15 loaves.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, 2 cups per loaf times 15 loaves equals 30 cups.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
