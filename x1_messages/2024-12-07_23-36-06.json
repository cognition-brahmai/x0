So, the correct answer is C. Case-control study.\n\nLet me explain this in more detail. In a case-control study, researchers select two groups of people: one group with the disease of interest (cases) and another group without the disease (controls). They then look back in time to compare the proportion of cases and controls who were exposed to a particular risk factor. This type of study is particularly useful when the disease is rare, or when it's not feasible to follow a large cohort over time.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to investigate whether smoking is associated with lung cancer. You could identify a group of individuals with lung cancer (cases) and another group without lung cancer (controls), and then determine how many in each group have a history of smoking. If a higher proportion of cases have a history of smoking compared to controls, this suggests that smoking may be a risk factor for lung cancer.\n\nCase-control studies are efficient for exploring potential risk factors but have some limitations. Since they are retrospective, relying on past exposures, they may be subject to biases such as recall bias (where cases might remember past exposures differently from controls) and selection bias (if controls are not properly matched to cases). Additionally, they cannot provide incidence rates or directly measure relative risk, but they can estimate odds ratios as a measure of association.\n\nIn contrast, a cohort study (option A) is a type of observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to see how their exposures relate to the development of diseases or other outcomes. This is a prospective approach, starting with exposure status and moving forward to observe outcomes.\n\nA cross-sectional study (option B) is a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population at a specific point in time, providing a snapshot of the prevalence of diseases and exposures without establishing a temporal sequence.\n\nA randomized controlled trial (option D) is an experimental study where participants are randomly assigned to receive an intervention or a control (often a placebo), and outcomes are compared between groups to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.\n\nEach of these study designs has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use depends on the research question, the feasibility of the study, and the resources available.\n"
