        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria doubling every 4 hours. Starting with 500 bacteria, I need to figure out how many there will be after 48 hours. Hmm, exponential growth, right? Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that exponential growth can be modeled by the formula:\n\n\\[N = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(N\\) is the final amount,\n\n- \\(N_0\\) is the initial amount,\n\n- \\(t\\) is the time elapsed,\n\n- \\(T\\) is the doubling time.\n\nIn this case, \\(N_0\\) is 500, \\(T\\) is 4 hours, and \\(t\\) is 48 hours. Plugging these values into the formula should give me the final amount.\n\nSo, \\(N = 500 \\times 2^{(48/4)}\\).\n\nSimplifying the exponent: \\(48 / 4 = 12\\).\n\nSo, \\(N = 500 \\times 2^{12}\\).\n\nNow, what's \\(2^{12}\\)? Let's see:\n\n\\(2^1 = 2\\)\n\n\\(2^2 = 4\\)\n\n\\(2^3 = 8\\)\n\n\\(2^4 = 16\\)\n\n\\(2^5 = 32\\)\n\n\\(2^6 = 64\\)\n\n\\(2^7 = 128\\)\n\n\\(2^8 = 256\\)\n\n\\(2^9 = 512\\)\n\n\\(2^{10} = 1024\\)\n\n\\(2^{11} = 2048\\)\n\n\\(2^{12} = 4096\\)\n\nSo, \\(N = 500 \\times 4096\\).\n\nNow, multiplying 500 by 4096.\n\n500 times 4000 is 2,000,000.\n\n500 times 90 is 45,000.\n\n500 times 6 is 3,000.\n\nAdding those up: 2,000,000 + 45,000 = 2,045,000; plus 3,000 is 2,048,000.\n\nSo, after 48 hours, there would be 2,048,000 bacteria.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 500 bacteria, doubling every 4 hours.\n\nAfter 4 hours: 500 \u00d7 2 = 1,000\n\nAfter 8 hours: 1,000 \u00d7 2 = 2,000\n\nAfter 12 hours: 2,000 \u00d7 2 = 4,000\n\nAfter 16 hours: 4,000 \u00d7 2 = 8,000\n\nAfter 20 hours: 8,000 \u00d7 2 = 16,000\n\nAfter 24 hours: 16,000 \u00d7 2 = 32,000\n\nAfter 28 hours: 32,000 \u00d7 2 = 64,000\n\nAfter 32 hours: 64,000 \u00d7 2 = 128,000\n\nAfter 36 hours: 128,000 \u00d7 2 = 256,000\n\nAfter 40 hours: 256,000 \u00d7 2 = 512,000\n\nAfter 44 hours: 512,000 \u00d7 2 = 1,024,000\n\nAfter 48 hours: 1,024,000 \u00d7 2 = 2,048,000\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 2,048,000 bacteria after 48 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of exponential functions using the natural base e. The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[N = N_0 \\times e^{(kt)}\\]\n\nWhere \\(k\\) is the growth rate.\n\nBut in this case, since it's doubling every 4 hours, the first formula is simpler to use.\n\nWait, maybe I should verify the value of \\(k\\) to see if both methods give the same result.\n\nFirst, find \\(k\\).\n\nGiven that it doubles every 4 hours:\n\n\\[2N_0 = N_0 \\times e^{(k \\times 4)}\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(N_0\\):\n\n\\[2 = e^{(4k)}\\]\n\nTake the natural log of both sides:\n\n\\[\\ln(2) = 4k\\]\n\nSo, \\(k = \\ln(2)/4\\)\n\nNow, plug \\(k\\) back into the exponential growth formula:\n\n\\[N = 500 \\times e^{((\\ln(2)/4) \\times 48)}\\]\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n\\((\\ln(2)/4) \\times 48 = 12 \\ln(2)\\)\n\nSo, \\(N = 500 \\times e^{12 \\ln(2)}\\)\n\nBut \\(e^{\\ln(2)} = 2\\), so \\(e^{12 \\ln(2)} = (e^{\\ln(2)})^{12} = 2^{12} = 4096\\)\n\nThus, \\(N = 500 \\times 4096 = 2,048,000\\)\n\nAgain, the same result. Good, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula \\(N = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)}\\), and plug in the values:\n\n\\(N = 500 \\times 2^{(48/4)} = 500 \\times 2^{12} = 500 \\times 4096 = 2,048,000\\)\n\nConsistent across methods.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors to consider. The problem seems straightforward: constant doubling every 4 hours with no restrictions on resources or space. In real-life scenarios, bacterial growth might be limited by factors like nutrient depletion or space constraints, but according to the problem, it's just unrestricted growth.\n\nSo, after 48 hours, there will be 2,048,000 bacteria.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's think about the units. Time is in hours, and the doubling time is in hours, so that's consistent.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the exponent is correctly calculated: \\(t/T = 48/4 = 12\\), and \\(2^{12} = 4096\\), which is correct.\n\nMultiplying 500 by 4096 indeed gives 2,048,000.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that every 4 hours the population doubles, then in 48 hours, there are \\(48/4 = 12\\) doubling periods.\n\nStarting with 500, after each doubling period:\n\n1st doubling: 500 \u00d7 2 = 1,000\n\n2nd doubling: 1,000 \u00d7 2 = 2,000\n\n3rd doubling: 2,000 \u00d7 2 = 4,000\n\n4th doubling: 4,000 \u00d7 2 = 8,000\n\n5th doubling: 8,000 \u00d7 2 = 16,000\n\n6th doubling: 16,000 \u00d7 2 = 32,000\n\n7th doubling: 32,000 \u00d7 2 = 64,000\n\n8th doubling: 64,000 \u00d7 2 = 128,000\n\n9th doubling: 128,000 \u00d7 2 = 256,000\n\n10th doubling: 256,000 \u00d7 2 = 512,000\n\n11th doubling: 512,000 \u00d7 2 = 1,024,000\n\n12th doubling: 1,024,000 \u00d7 2 = 2,048,000\n\nSame result again.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that after 48 hours, there will be 2,048,000 bacteria.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2048000} \\]"
