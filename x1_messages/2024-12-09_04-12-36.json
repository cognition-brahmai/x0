        "content": "So the factory produces 100 units every day, and each unit costs $10 to make. They sell each unit for $15, but 20% of the units are defective and can't be sold. We need to find out the daily profit.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many units are actually good and can be sold. If 20% are defective, then 80% should be good, right? So, 80% of 100 units is 80 units that can be sold.\n\nNext, each good unit is sold for $15, so the revenue from selling these units would be 80 units times $15 per unit. That should be $1,200.\n\nNow, the cost to produce all 100 units is 100 units times $10 per unit, which is $1,000.\n\nProfit is revenue minus cost, so $1,200 minus $1,000 should give us a profit of $200 per day.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that sometimes there are other costs involved, like overhead or maintenance, but the problem only mentions the production cost per unit. So, maybe $200 is the correct daily profit.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits produced: 100\n\nDefective units: 20% of 100 = 20 units\n\nGood units: 100 - 20 = 80 units\n\nRevenue: 80 units * $15 = $1,200\n\nCost: 100 units * $10 = $1,000\n\nProfit: $1,200 - $1,000 = $200\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
