        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has 10 cows and 6 chickens. Each cow gives 5 liters of milk per day, and each chicken lays 2 eggs per day. I need to find out how much milk and how many eggs the farmer gets daily.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the milk from the cows. Since each cow gives 5 liters per day, and there are 10 cows, I can multiply the number of cows by the milk per cow:\n\nMilk from cows = 10 cows * 5 liters/cow/day = 50 liters/day\n\nNext, I'll calculate the eggs from the chickens. Each chicken lays 2 eggs per day, and there are 6 chickens, so:\n\nEggs from chickens = 6 chickens * 2 eggs/chicken/day = 12 eggs/day\n\nSo, the farmer gets 50 liters of milk and 12 eggs daily.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Are there any other animals or any additional information provided? No, the question seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be sure, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFor milk:\n\n10 cows * 5 liters/cow/day = 50 liters/day\n\nFor eggs:\n\n6 chickens * 2 eggs/chicken/day = 12 eggs/day\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in a step-by-step manner.\n\nStarting with the cows:\n\n- Cow 1: 5 liters\n\n- Cow 2: 5 liters\n\n- ...\n\n- Cow 10: 5 liters\n\nTotal milk from cows = 5 liters * 10 = 50 liters\n\nSimilarly, for chickens:\n\n- Chicken 1: 2 eggs\n\n- Chicken 2: 2 eggs\n\n- ...\n\n- Chicken 6: 2 eggs\n\nTotal eggs from chickens = 2 eggs * 6 = 12 eggs\n\nSo, the farmer gets 50 liters of milk and 12 eggs each day.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ liters of milk and } 12 \\text{ eggs daily}} \\]"
