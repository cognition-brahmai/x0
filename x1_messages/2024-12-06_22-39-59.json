I have these tools to help me: WebSearch, LinkCollector, ContentScraper, InfoProcessor, and QueryAnswerer. I should plan this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably search the web for information about the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature. So, I'll use the WebSearch tool with the input \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2019 winner.\"\n\nStep: Search the web for \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2019 winner\"\n:Evidence1: = WebSearch[\"Nobel Prize in Literature 2019 winner\"]\n\nNext, from the search results, I need to collect the relevant links that might have the information I'm looking for. I can use the LinkCollector tool on the results from Evidence1.\n\nStep: Collect links from the web search results\n:Evidence2: = LinkCollector[:Evidence1:]\n\nNow, I need to scrape the content from these links to get the actual information. I'll use the ContentScraper tool on the links collected in Evidence2.\n\nStep: Scrape the content from the collected links\n:Evidence3: = ContentScraper[:Evidence2:]\n\nWith the scraped content, I should process it to get concise information. The InfoProcessor tool can help me with that.\n\nStep: Process the scraped content to get concise information\n:Evidence4: = InfoProcessor[:Evidence3:]\n\nFinally, I can use the QueryAnswerer tool to answer the specific question: \"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019?\" based on the processed information from Evidence4.\n\nStep: Answer the query using the processed information\n:Evidence5: = QueryAnswerer[\"Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019?\", :Evidence4:]\n\nSo, the final response will be Evidence5.\n\nFinal Response: :Evidence5:"
