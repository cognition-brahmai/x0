        "content": "Let's see. I have this probability problem here. There are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. I'm supposed to pick a ball three times, each time noting its color and putting it back in the bag. I need to find the probability that exactly two of those picks are red balls.\n\nFirst, I should understand the basics of probability here. Since I'm putting the ball back each time, each pick is independent of the others. That means the probability of picking a red ball doesn't change from pick to pick.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball in one pick is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/8. Similarly, the probability of picking a blue ball is 3/8.\n\nNow, I'm picking three times and I want exactly two red balls. That means one of the picks should be blue.\n\nThis sounds like a binomial probability problem. The formula for the probability of getting exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\n- n is the number of trials.\n\n- k is the number of successes.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- n = 3 (since I'm picking three times)\n\n- k = 2 (I want exactly two red balls)\n\n- p = 5/8 (probability of picking a red ball)\n\nSo plugging these values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(3, 2) * (5/8)^2 * (3/8)^{3-2}\n\nFirst, I need to calculate C(3, 2), which is the number of ways to choose 2 successes out of 3 trials. That's equal to 3.\n\nThen, (5/8)^2 is (5/8)*(5/8) = 25/64.\n\nAnd (3/8)^1 is just 3/8.\n\nNow, multiplying them all together:\n\nP(X = 2) = 3 * (25/64) * (3/8) = 3 * (25/64) * (3/8) = 3 * (75/512) = 225/512.\n\nSo, the probability is 225/512.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the different sequences where I pick exactly two red balls and one blue ball.\n\nThe possible sequences are:\n\n1. Red, Red, Blue\n\n2. Red, Blue, Red\n\n3. Blue, Red, Red\n\nEach of these sequences has the same probability: (5/8)*(5/8)*(3/8) = 75/512.\n\nSince there are three such sequences, the total probability is 3*(75/512) = 225/512.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier using the binomial formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it using permutations and combinations.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 8^3, since each pick is independent and there are 8 balls each time.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because we're dealing with probabilities, not individual outcomes.\n\nWait, actually, since the balls are being replaced, the total number of possible outcomes is indeed 8^3.\n\nBut that might not be the best way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, the number of ways to pick exactly two red balls out of three picks is C(3, 2).\n\nAnd the probability for each of those ways is (5/8)^2 * (3/8).\n\nWhich is again the binomial formula.\n\nSo, I think I'm on the right track.\n\nWait, maybe I can calculate it using combinations.\n\nBut actually, in probability with replacement, the binomial formula is the way to go.\n\nSo, I think 225/512 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I list all possible sequences:\n\nRRR, RRB, RBR, BRR, RBG, BRG, etc.\n\nWait, no, the balls are either red or blue, no green.\n\nSo, sequences are RRR, RRB, RBR, BRR, RBB, BRB, BBR, BBB.\n\nI need the ones with exactly two R's: RRB, RBR, BRR.\n\nEach of these has probability (5/8)^2 * (3/8) = 75/512.\n\nSo, total probability is 3*(75/512) = 225/512.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it using the formula for binomial probability.\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, I think it's confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking exactly two red balls in three picks with replacement is 225/512.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{225}{512}} \\]"
