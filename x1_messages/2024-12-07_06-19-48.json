        "content": "Yes, chastity belts were used during the Middle Ages, particularly in Europe, as a means to prevent sexual activity among women, especially during their husbands' absences. The belts were made of metal or leather and designed to cover the genital area, making sexual intercourse impossible. The idea was to preserve a woman's virtue and fidelity. However, the actual usage and prevalence of chastity belts in the Middle Ages are subjects of debate among historians, with some questioning their widespread use and others believing they were indeed employed in certain contexts."
