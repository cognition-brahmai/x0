        "content": "So I've got this problem here. It says that in a group of people, 75% have brown eyes and 25% have blue eyes. And there are 12 people with blue eyes. I need to find out how many people are in the group total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that percentages represent parts of a whole, and in this case, the whole is the total number of people in the group. So, 25% of the group has blue eyes, and that corresponds to 12 people.\n\nI think I can set up an equation to solve for the total number of people. Let's denote the total number of people as \\( t \\).\n\nGiven that 25% of \\( t \\) is equal to 12, I can write:\n\n\\[ 0.25 \\times t = 12 \\]\n\nNow, to find \\( t \\), I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{12}{0.25} \\]\n\nCalculating that, 12 divided by 0.25 is the same as 12 multiplied by 4, which equals 48.\n\nSo, the total number of people in the group is 48.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If 25% of 48 is 12, then 75% should be the remaining part of the group, which should have brown eyes.\n\nLet me calculate 75% of 48:\n\n\\[ 0.75 \\times 48 = 36 \\]\n\nSo, 36 people have brown eyes, and 12 have blue eyes, which adds up to 48.\n\nThat seems correct. Alternatively, I could think about it in terms of fractions.\n\n25% is the same as \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), so if \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the group is 12, then the whole group is 4 times 12, which is 48.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up a proportion.\n\nIf 25% corresponds to 12 people, then 100% corresponds to \\( t \\) people.\n\nSo, I can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{25}{100} = \\frac{12}{t} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\), I cross-multiply:\n\n\\[ 25t = 12 \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 25t = 1200 \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{1200}{25} \\]\n\n\\[ t = 48 \\]\n\nAgain, I get 48 people in the group.\n\nI think this is solid. But to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there any chance that the percentages don't add up to 100%? Well, 75% plus 25% is 100%, so that checks out.\n\nAlso, the problem states that these are the only two eye color categories, so there are no other possibilities to consider.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people in the group is 48.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
