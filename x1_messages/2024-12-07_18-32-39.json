        "content": "Let's see. There are 8 houses on the street, numbered from 1 to 8. The even-numbered houses are painted blue, and the odd-numbered houses are painted red. So, the houses go like this:\n\n- House 1: Red\n\n- House 2: Blue\n\n- House 3: Red\n\n- House 4: Blue\n\n- House 5: Red\n\n- House 6: Blue\n\n- House 7: Red\n\n- House 8: Blue\n\nNow, I need to find out how many blue houses are between the first red house and the last red house.\n\nFirst, identify the first red house and the last red house.\n\n- The first red house is house number 1.\n\n- The last red house is house number 7.\n\nSo, I need to look at the houses between number 1 and number 7.\n\nLet's list the houses between 1 and 7:\n\n- House 2: Blue\n\n- House 3: Red\n\n- House 4: Blue\n\n- House 5: Red\n\n- House 6: Blue\n\nNow, among these, the blue houses are:\n\n- House 2: Blue\n\n- House 4: Blue\n\n- House 6: Blue\n\nSo, there are 3 blue houses between the first and last red houses.\n\nWait a minute, but house 8 is also blue, but it's after house 7, so it shouldn't be included.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst red house: House 1\n\nLast red house: House 7\n\nHouses between them: House 2 to House 6\n\nAmong these, the blue houses are 2, 4, and 6.\n\nSo, indeed, 3 blue houses.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
