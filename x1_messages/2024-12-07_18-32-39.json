        "content": "Let's solve this system of linear equations. We have two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x - y = 1 \\)\n\nI can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. I'll choose the elimination method because it seems straightforward for this system.\n\nFirst, I'll add both equations together to eliminate \\( y \\):\n\n\\( (x + y) + (2x - y) = 5 + 1 \\)\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\( x + y + 2x - y = 3x = 6 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 3x = 6 \\). Dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\( x = 2 \\)\n\nNow that I have \\( x = 2 \\), I can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find \\( y \\). Let's use the first equation:\n\n\\( x + y = 5 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\( 2 + y = 5 \\)\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides:\n\n\\( y = 3 \\)\n\nSo, the solution to the system is \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\).\n\nTo verify, I'll plug these values back into both equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n\\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond equation:\n\n\\( 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. Therefore, the solution is \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 3 \\)."
