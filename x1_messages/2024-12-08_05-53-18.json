        "content": "Let's see. So, the store offers a 20% discount if you buy 5 items or more. Each item costs $50, and I need to buy 7 items with the discount applied. Okay, first I should find out the total cost without the discount.\n\nSo, if one item is $50, then 7 items would be 7 times $50. Let me calculate that:\n\n7 * 50 = 350\n\nSo, without any discount, the total cost would be $350.\n\nNow, since I'm buying 7 items, which is more than 5, I qualify for the 20% discount. So, I need to calculate what 20% of $350 is and then subtract that from the total.\n\nFirst, find 20% of $350.\n\n20% of 350 is (20/100) * 350.\n\n20/100 is 0.2, so 0.2 * 350 = 70.\n\nSo, the discount is $70.\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the original total:\n\n350 - 70 = 280\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy 7 items with the discount applied would be $280.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm doing this correctly. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that with a 20% discount, you're paying 80% of the original price.\n\nBecause 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, if the original total is $350, then paying 80% of that would be the same as $350 * 0.8.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n350 * 0.8 = 280\n\nYes, same result. So, $280 is indeed the total cost after applying the 20% discount.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the price per item after the discount and then multiply by 7.\n\nIf each item is $50 and there's a 20% discount, then the discount per item is 20% of $50.\n\n20% of 50 is (20/100)*50 = 0.2*50 = 10.\n\nSo, each item has a $10 discount, meaning each item costs $50 - $10 = $40 after the discount.\n\nThen, for 7 items, it would be 7 * $40 = $280.\n\nAgain, the same total of $280.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with $280 as the total cost for 7 items with the discount applied.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any possibility that the discount applies only to items beyond the first5? For example, maybe the first 5 items get a discount, and any beyond that are at full price.\n\nBut the wording of the offer says \"if you buy 5 items or more, you get a 20% discount on your purchase.\" It seems like the discount applies to the entire purchase, not just to the items beyond the threshold.\n\nSo, in this case, the entire purchase of 7 items gets the 20% discount.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $280.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{280} \\]"
