        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 200 employees, and the average salary is $50,000 per year. That means overall, the company is paying out a total of 200 times $50,000 in salaries. Let me calculate that:\n\nTotal salary payout = 200 * $50,000 = $10,000,000.\n\nNow, the company decides to give a 10% raise to half of its employees. Half of 200 is 100 employees. So, 100 employees are getting a 10% raise.\n\nFirst, I need to find out what the average salary of these 100 employees is. Wait, the problem says that the average salary of all employees is $50,000, but it doesn't specify if all employees have the same salary or if there are differences. However, since it's the average, I'll assume that the raise is being given to half of the employees, regardless of their current salaries.\n\nBut to simplify, maybe I can assume that all employees have the same salary initially, which is $50,000. Then, giving a 10% raise to half of them would mean that 100 employees get a raise to $55,000, while the other 100 remain at $50,000.\n\nLet me check if that's a valid assumption. The problem doesn't specify the distribution of salaries, so assuming all employees have the same salary to start with might simplify the calculation without loss of generality.\n\nSo, assuming all 200 employees initially earn $50,000.\n\nThen, 100 employees get a 10% raise. 10% of $50,000 is $5,000, so their new salary would be $55,000.\n\nNow, to find the new average salary, I need to calculate the total salary payout after the raise and then divide by the number of employees, which is still 200.\n\nTotal salary after raise = (100 employees * $55,000) + (100 employees * $50,000)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n100 * $55,000 = $5,500,000\n\n100 * $50,000 = $5,000,000\n\nTotal salary = $5,500,000 + $5,000,000 = $10,500,000\n\nNow, new average salary = Total salary / Number of employees = $10,500,000 / 200 = $52,500.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should consider if the raise is only for half of the employees, and perhaps their original salaries were different.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the half that's getting the raise has a different average salary than the other half.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that. It just says that the average salary of all employees is $50,000, and a 10% raise is given to half of the employees.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the half getting the raise has an average salary of $50,000, and the other half remains unchanged at $50,000.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if all employees have the same average salary, then giving a raise to half of them would indeed bring the new average up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the half getting the raise has a higher or lower average salary to start with.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I think my initial approach is valid.\n\nSo, the new average salary would be $52,500.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nTotal original salary = 200 * $50,000 = $10,000,000\n\nRaise for 100 employees: 10% of $50,000 = $5,000 per employee\n\nTotal raise amount = 100 * $5,000 = $500,000\n\nNew total salary = $10,000,000 + $500,000 = $10,500,000\n\nNew average salary = $10,500,000 / 200 = $52,500\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of weighted averages.\n\nThe new average salary is the average of two groups: one with salaries increased by 10%, and the other with salaries unchanged.\n\nSo, new average = (100 * $55,000 + 100 * $50,000) / 200 = ($5,500,000 + $5,000,000) / 200 = $10,500,000 / 200 = $52,500\n\nSame result.\n\nI think $52,500 is the correct new average salary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52500} \\]"
