        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving from Station A going towards Station B at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaving from Station B going towards Station A at 90 miles per hour. The distance between the two stations is 300 miles. I need to find out how long it will take for these two trains to meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nSo, combined speed = 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two stations is 300 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 300 miles, and the combined speed is 150 mph.\n\nSo, Time = 300 miles / 150 mph = 2 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing?\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I should consider the speed of each train and see how much distance each covers in that time.\n\nIf the first train is going at 60 mph, in 2 hours, it would cover 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nThe second train is going at 90 mph, so in 2 hours, it would cover 90 mph * 2 hours = 180 miles.\n\nNow, if I add the distances covered by both trains: 120 miles + 180 miles = 300 miles, which is exactly the distance between the two stations.\n\nSo, yes, it makes sense that they will meet after 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 150 mph, and the time to meet would be the distance divided by the relative speed, which again is 300 miles / 150 mph = 2 hours.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the time it takes for the combined distance they cover to equal the total distance between the stations.\n\nSo, if Train A covers 60 miles each hour and Train B covers 90 miles each hour, together they cover 150 miles each hour.\n\nTherefore, to cover 300 miles, it would take 300 / 150 = 2 hours.\n\nYes, all these methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here, it's a straightforward relative speed problem.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
