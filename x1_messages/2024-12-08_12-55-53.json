        "content": "So the factory originally produces 500 units per day at $8 per unit. That means their initial daily cost is 500 units times $8, which is $4,000. Now, they want to increase production to 700 units per day. That's an increase of 200 units, but the problem says they can increase production by 100 units per day for an additional $5 per extra unit.\n\nWait, so increasing by 100 units costs an extra $5 per unit. But they need to increase by 200 units. So, for the first 100 units, it's $5 extra per unit, and for the next 100 units, I'm assuming it's the same rate, unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, the cost for the first 500 units is 500 * $8 = $4,000.\n\nFor the next 100 units, it's 100 * ($8 + $5) = 100 * $13 = $1,300.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, \"increase production by 100 units per day for an additional cost of $5 per extra unit produced.\" So, for each extra 100 units, it's an additional $5 per unit.\n\nSo, for the first 100 extra units, it's $5 extra per unit on top of the original $8, so $13 per unit.\n\nBut they need to increase by 200 units, which is two increments of 100 units.\n\nSo, for the first 100 extra units, it's $13 per unit.\n\nFor the next 100 extra units, it's again $13 per unit.\n\nWait, but maybe the way it's phrased means that for any increase beyond the initial 500, it's $5 extra per unit, not per each 100 units.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"The factory can increase production by 100 units per day for an additional cost of $5 per extra unit produced.\"\n\nHmm, it might be ambiguous. Does it mean that for each 100 units increase, there's an additional $5 per unit, or that increasing production by 100 units adds $5 per extra unit produced?\n\nI think it's saying that for each unit beyond the initial 500, there's an additional $5 cost per unit.\n\nSo, for example, if they produce 501 units, it's $8 for the first 500 and $8 + $5 = $13 for the 501st unit.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"increase production by 100 units per day for an additional cost of $5 per extra unit produced.\"\n\nMaybe it means that when they increase production by 100 units, those 100 extra units each cost an additional $5, on top of the original $8.\n\nSo, each of the extra 100 units costs $8 + $5 = $13.\n\nTherefore, for 200 extra units, it would be 200 * $13 = $2,600.\n\nThen, the total cost would be the original $4,000 plus $2,600, totaling $6,600.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"increase production by 100 units per day for an additional cost of $5 per extra unit produced.\"\n\nAlternatively, it might mean that for each 100 units increase, there's a step increase of $5 per unit.\n\nBut I think the straightforward interpretation is that each extra unit beyond the initial 500 costs an additional $5.\n\nSo, for 700 units:\n\n- 500 units at $8 each: 500 * $8 = $4,000\n\n- 200 extra units at $8 + $5 = $13 each: 200 * $13 = $2,600\n\n- Total cost: $4,000 + $2,600 = $6,600\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"for an additional cost of $5 per extra unit produced\" applies only to the increment of 100 units.\n\nWait, maybe it's that for each 100 units increase, there's an additional $5 per unit for those 100 units.\n\nSo, for the first 100 extra units, it's $8 + $5 = $13 per unit.\n\nFor the next 100 extra units, it's again $8 + $5 = $13 per unit.\n\nSo, 500 units at $8 = $4,000\n\nFirst 100 extra at $13 = $1,300\n\nNext 100 extra at $13 = $1,300\n\nTotal: $4,000 + $1,300 + $1,300 = $6,600\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the \"for an additional cost of $5 per extra unit produced\" applies to all units beyond the initial 500, then it's the same calculation.\n\nSo, total cost is $6,600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6600} \\]"
