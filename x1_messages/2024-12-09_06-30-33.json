        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's assume we have a database with several tables, and you want to perform various operations on them using SQL queries. I'll provide you with examples for each task you mentioned, and I'll include comments in the code to explain what each part does.\n\n### 1. Find the total number of records in each table.\n\nTo find the total number of records in each table, you can write a query for each table. Let's assume we have tables named `table1`, `table2`, and `table3`.\n\n```sql\n-- Query to find the total number of records in table1\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records_table1 FROM table1;\n\n-- Query to find the total number of records in table2\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records_table2 FROM table2;\n\n-- Query to find the total number of records in table3\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records_table3 FROM table3;\n```\n\n### 2. List the top 5 most frequent values in a specific column.\n\nLet's say you want to find the top 5 most frequent values in the `category` column of `table1`.\n\n```sql\n-- Query to list the top 5 most frequent values in the category column of table1\nSELECT category, COUNT(*) AS frequency\nFROM table1\nGROUP BY category\nORDER BY frequency DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\n### 3. Count the number of null values in each column.\n\nTo count the number of null values in each column of a table, you can write a query like this for `table1`.\n\n```sql\n-- Query to count the number of null values in each column of table1\nSELECT\n    SUM(CASE WHEN column1 IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_column1,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN column2 IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_column2,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN column3 IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_column3\n-- Add more columns as needed\nFROM table1;\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `column1`, `column2`, etc., with the actual column names in your table.\n\n### 4. Retrieve data that matches certain conditions.\n\nSuppose you want to retrieve all records from `table2` where the `status` column is 'active' and the `date` column is after '2023-01-01'.\n\n```sql\n-- Query to retrieve data from table2 where status is 'active' and date is after '2023-01-01'\nSELECT *\nFROM table2\nWHERE status = 'active' AND date > '2023-01-01';\n```\n\n### General Tips\n\n- **Comments**: In SQL, comments start with two hyphens (`-- `) and extend to the end of the line. This helps in explaining the purpose of each query.\n\n- **Counting Records**: The `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of rows in a table.\n\n- **Grouping and Ordering**: The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, and `ORDER BY` is used to sort the results.\n\n- **Handling NULL Values**: The `IS NULL` condition is used to check for null values, and `SUM(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` is a way to count nulls per column.\n\n- **Conditional Selection**: The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows based on specified conditions.\n\nThese queries should cover the basic operations you need. If you have more specific requirements or different table structures, you might need to adjust the queries accordingly."
