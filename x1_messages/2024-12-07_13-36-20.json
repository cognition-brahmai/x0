        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual revenue of $1 million. It spends 60% on salaries, 20% on rent, and 15% on other expenses. I need to find out what percentage is left for profit or reinvestment.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much is being spent in total on salaries, rent, and other expenses. Then, subtract that total from the overall revenue to find the remaining amount.\n\nSo, salaries are 60% of $1 million. That would be 0.60 multiplied by 1,000,000, which is $600,000.\n\nRent is 20% of $1 million. So, 0.20 times 1,000,000 equals $200,000.\n\nOther expenses are 15% of $1 million. That's 0.15 times 1,000,000, which is $150,000.\n\nNow, I'll add up these expenses: $600,000 plus $200,000 is $800,000, and then plus $150,000 makes $950,000.\n\nThe total revenue is $1,000,000, so the remaining amount is $1,000,000 minus $950,000, which is $50,000.\n\nTo find the remaining percentage, I'll divide the remaining amount by the total revenue and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, $50,000 divided by $1,000,000 is 0.05, and 0.05 multiplied by 100 is 5%.\n\nTherefore, the remaining percentage available for profit or reinvestment is 5%.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to calculate this without finding the actual amounts?\n\nYes, actually. Since all the percentages are given based on the revenue, I can just add up the percentages spent on salaries, rent, and other expenses, and then subtract that total from 100% to find the remaining percentage.\n\nSo, salaries are 60%, rent is 20%, and other expenses are 15%. Adding those up: 60% plus 20% is 80%, plus 15% makes 95%.\n\nSubtracting that from 100%: 100% minus 95% equals 5%.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, the remaining percentage is indeed 5%.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any possibility that some expenses are overlapping or that there are hidden costs?\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems like all expenses are accounted for with the given percentages. There's no mention of other expenses beyond salaries, rent, and other expenses, so I think 5% is the correct remaining percentage for profit or reinvestment.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if the percentages add up correctly.\n\n60% (salaries) + 20% (rent) + 15% (other expenses) = 95%.\n\n100% (total revenue) - 95% (total expenses) = 5% remaining.\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nSo, the answer is 5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5\\%} \\]"
