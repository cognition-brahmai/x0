        "content": "To find the capacity of a cylindrical water tank in liters, we first need to calculate its volume in cubic meters and then convert that volume to liters. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the tank is 6 meters, the radius \\( r \\) is half of that, which is 3 meters. The height \\( h \\) is given as 4 meters.\n\nLet's plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (3)^2 (4) \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (9) (4) \\]\n\n\\[ V = 36\\pi \\]\n\nNow, calculating the numerical value:\n\n\\[ V \\approx 36 \\times 3.1416 \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 113.0976 \\, \\text{cubic meters} \\]\n\nSince 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters, we can convert the volume to liters:\n\n\\[ \\text{Capacity} = 113.0976 \\times 1000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Capacity} \\approx 113,097.6 \\, \\text{liters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the capacity of the cylindrical water tank is approximately 113,097.6 liters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{113097.6 \\, \\text{liters}} \\]"
