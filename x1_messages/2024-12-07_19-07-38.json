        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: if you toss a coin three times, what's the probability of getting exactly two heads? Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when tossing a coin three times. Each toss has two possible results: heads (H) or tails (T). So, for three tosses, the total number of possible outcomes should be 2 multiplied by itself three times, which is 2^3 = 8. So, there are 8 possible sequences of heads and tails.\n\nLet me list them out to make sure:\n\n1. HHH\n\n2. HHT\n\n3. HTH\n\n4. HTT\n\n5. THH\n\n6. THT\n\n7. TTH\n\n8. TTT\n\nOkay, that's 8 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of outcomes that have exactly two heads. Let's look at the list:\n\n1. HHH - that's three heads, not two.\n\n2. HHT - that's two heads and one tail.\n\n3. HTH - that's also two heads and one tail.\n\n4. HTT - that's one head and two tails.\n\n5. THH - two heads and one tail.\n\n6. THT - one head and two tails.\n\n7. TTH - one head and two tails.\n\n8. TTT - no heads.\n\nSo, from the list, the outcomes with exactly two heads are HHT, HTH, and THH. That's three outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 3 divided by 8, which is 3/8.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using combinations? Because order doesn't matter in this case; we just care about how many heads there are, not the sequence.\n\nYes, combinations would be appropriate here. The number of ways to choose 2 heads out of 3 tosses is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of tosses, and k is the number of heads we want.\n\nSo, C(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3 - 2)!) = (6) / (2 * 1) = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo, there are 3 ways to get exactly two heads in three tosses, which matches what I found earlier by listing them out.\n\nAnd since each outcome is equally likely, the probability is again 3/8.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using probability trees or something like that?\n\nWell, a probability tree would work, but for three tosses, it might be a bit more time-consuming. Let's see:\n\nFirst toss: Heads (probability 1/2) or Tails (probability 1/2)\n\nIf first is Heads:\n\n- Second toss: Heads or Tails\n\n- If second is Heads:\n\n- Third toss: Heads or Tails\n\n- If third is Heads: HHH\n\n- If third is Tails: HHT\n\n- If second is Tails:\n\n- Third toss: Heads or Tails\n\n- If third is Heads: HTH\n\n- If third is Tails: HTT\n\nSimilarly for first toss Tails:\n\n- Second toss: Heads or Tails\n\n- If second is Heads:\n\n- Third toss: Heads or Tails\n\n- If third is Heads: THH\n\n- If third is Tails: THT\n\n- If second is Tails:\n\n- Third toss: Heads or Tails\n\n- If third is Heads: TTH\n\n- If third is Tails: TTT\n\nAgain, this gives us the same 8 possible outcomes, and among them, HHT, HTH, and THH have exactly two heads, so probability is 3/8.\n\nAlternatively, since each toss is independent, the probability of any specific sequence is (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nSince there are 3 favorable sequences, the total probability is 3 * (1/8) = 3/8.\n\nAlright, so no matter which way I approach this, I keep getting 3/8 as the probability of getting exactly two heads in three coin tosses.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the coin is unfair. But the question doesn't specify that, so I'll assume it's a fair coin, where the probability of heads and tails is equal, i.e., 1/2 each.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not counting any outcomes twice. In the list I made earlier, each outcome is unique, so that's good.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the order matters. In this case, it doesn't because we're only counting the number of heads, not the sequence in which they appear. That's why combinations are appropriate here, as they don't consider order.\n\nWait, but in the list, HHT, HTH, and THH are different sequences, but they all have exactly two heads. So, even though the order is different, they are all favorable outcomes.\n\nIf the question was about getting two heads in a specific order, that would be different, but since it's about exactly two heads without specifying the order, combinations are the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of binary sequences, where heads are 1 and tails are 0, and count the number of 3-digit binary numbers with exactly two 1's. That's again C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nSo, all these methods lead me to the same conclusion: the probability is 3/8.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a different approach. The probability of getting exactly two heads is the same as the probability of getting exactly one tail.\n\nSo, we can calculate the probability of getting exactly one tail in three tosses.\n\nAgain, using combinations: C(3, 1) = 3, so there are 3 outcomes with exactly one tail: HHT, HTH, and THH.\n\nSo, probability is 3/8, which matches what I have earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(k successes in n trials) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere p is the probability of success (in this case, getting heads), which is 1/2.\n\nSo, P(exactly 2 heads in 3 tosses) = C(3, 2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^(3-2) = 3 * (1/4) * (1/2) = 3 * (1/8) = 3/8.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to approach this problem, and all methods confirm that the probability is 3/8.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, let's consider if the coin tosses are not independent. But the problem states it's a coin toss, so we can assume each toss is independent of the others.\n\nAlso, since it's a fair coin, there's no bias towards heads or tails.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3/8.\n\nWait, but probabilities are often expressed as decimals or percentages as well. 3/8 is 0.375, or 37.5%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the format, I'll stick with the fractional form, 3/8.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Total possible outcomes: 8\n\n- Favorable outcomes: 3 (HHT, HTH, THH)\n\n- Probability: 3/8\n\nI think that's clear and concise.\n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake somewhere? Let me think.\n\n- Mistakenly counting an outcome twice: doesn't seem likely, as each sequence is unique.\n\n- Incorrectly applying the combination formula: no, C(3,2) is indeed 3.\n\n- Miscounting the total number of outcomes: no, 2^3 is 8.\n\n- Incorrectly assuming independence: but coin tosses are independent.\n\n- Forgetting about the possibility of different probabilities for heads and tails: but it's a fair coin.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes. The answer should be 3/8.\n\nJust for fun, let's simulate it.\n\nSuppose I toss a coin three times many times and record the outcomes.\n\nOver a large number of trials, the proportion of times I get exactly two heads should approach 3/8.\n\nFor example, if I do 1000 trials, I should get approximately 375 times with exactly two heads.\n\nBut since this is theoretical probability, and we assume the coin is fair, the exact probability is 3/8.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}} \\]"
