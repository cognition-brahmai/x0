You want to know how much money you'll have after one year. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, understanding what \"compounded monthly\" means is key. It means that the interest is calculated and added to your account each month, based on the current balance. Since the interest is compounded monthly, the annual interest rate is divided by 12 to get the monthly interest rate.\n\nSo, the monthly interest rate is 3% divided by 12, which is 0.25% per month.\n\nNow, to calculate the amount after one year, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP = $10,000\n\nr = 3% or 0.03\n\nn = 12 (since it's compounded monthly)\n\nt = 1 year\n\nA = 10000 * (1 + 0.03/12)^(12*1)\n\nFirst, calculate the monthly interest rate:\n\n0.03 / 12 = 0.0025\n\nThen, add 1 to get:\n\n1 + 0.0025 = 1.0025\n\nNow, raise this to the power of 12:\n\n1.0025^12 \u2248 1.030415957\n\nFinally, multiply by the principal amount:\n\n10000 * 1.030415957 \u2248 10304.16\n\nSo, after one year, you'll have approximately $10,304.16 in your account.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it step by step for each month, but that would be more time-consuming. Each month, the interest is calculated on the current balance, and that interest is added to the balance for the next month.\n\nFor example, in the first month:\n\nInterest = $10,000 * 0.0025 = $25\n\nNew balance = $10,000 + $25 = $10,025\n\nIn the second month:\n\nInterest = $10,025 * 0.0025 = $25.0625\n\nNew balance = $10,025 + $25.0625 = $10,050.0625\n\nAnd this process repeats for each of the 12 months.\n\nBut using the formula is much easier and straightforward.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the more frequent the compounding, the higher the amount will be, but in this case, since it's compounded monthly, which is standard for many savings accounts, $10,304.16 is your total after one year.\n\nIf the interest was compounded annually, you'd simply earn 3% on the principal amount, which would be $10,000 * 1.03 = $10,300. So, with monthly compounding, you earn a little bit more due to the effect of compound interest.\n\nAlways remember to check the compounding frequency when comparing interest rates on savings accounts or any other investment products. It can make a difference in the total amount you earn over time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10304.16} \\]"
