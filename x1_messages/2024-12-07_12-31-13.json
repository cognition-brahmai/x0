        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 5(3x - 2) + 4 = 7(x + 6). Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to simplify both sides of the equation as much as possible before solving for x.\n\nStarting with the left side: 5(3x - 2) + 4.\n\nI need to distribute the 5 across the terms inside the parentheses. So, 5 times 3x is 15x, and 5 times -2 is -10. So, that gives me 15x - 10. Then, I add 4 to that. So, 15x - 10 + 4. Combining the constants, -10 + 4 is -6. So, the left side simplifies to 15x - 6.\n\nNow, let's look at the right side: 7(x + 6).\n\nI need to distribute the 7 across the terms inside the parentheses. So, 7 times x is 7x, and 7 times 6 is 42. So, the right side simplifies to 7x + 42.\n\nNow, the equation looks like this: 15x - 6 = 7x + 42.\n\nNext, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Let's subtract 7x from both sides to start moving the x terms to the left side.\n\nSo, 15x - 7x - 6 = 7x - 7x + 42.\n\nThat simplifies to 8x - 6 = 42.\n\nNow, I'll add 6 to both sides to move the constant term to the right side.\n\nSo, 8x - 6 + 6 = 42 + 6.\n\nThat simplifies to 8x = 48.\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 8 to solve for x.\n\nSo, 8x / 8 = 48 / 8.\n\nThat gives me x = 6.\n\nLet me just double-check that. If I plug x = 6 back into the original equation, does it hold true?\n\nStarting with the left side: 5(3*(6) - 2) + 4 = 5(18 - 2) + 4 = 5(16) + 4 = 80 + 4 = 84.\n\nNow, the right side: 7(6 + 6) = 7(12) = 84.\n\nYes, both sides equal 84, so x = 6 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
