        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. To connect to a PostgreSQL database using Python, you'll need to use the `psycopg2` library, which is a popular PostgreSQL adapter for Python. If you don't have it installed already, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install psycopg2\n```\n\nOnce you have `psycopg2` installed, you can proceed to write the Python script to connect to your PostgreSQL database, create the \"employees\" table, and insert three sample records.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Import the necessary modules:**\n\n   You'll need to import `psycopg2` and possibly `sys` for handling exceptions.\n\n   ```python\n   import psycopg2\n   import sys\n   ```\n\n2. **Establish a connection to the database:**\n\n   You'll need to provide the database name, user, password, and host. Adjust these parameters based on your database configuration.\n\n   ```python\n   try:\n       conn = psycopg2.connect(\n           database=\"your_database_name\",\n           user=\"your_username\",\n           password=\"your_password\",\n           host=\"your_host\",\n           port=\"your_port\"\n       )\n       print(\"Connected to the database successfully\")\n   except psycopg2.Error as e:\n       print(f\"Error connecting to the database: {e}\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a cursor object:**\n\n   A cursor is required to execute SQL commands.\n\n   ```python\n   cur = conn.cursor()\n   ```\n\n4. **Create the \"employees\" table:**\n\n   Define the SQL command to create the table and execute it.\n\n   ```python\n   create_table_query = '''\n   CREATE TABLE employees (\n       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n       name TEXT NOT NULL,\n       salary REAL NOT NULL\n   )\n   '''\n   try:\n       cur.execute(create_table_query)\n       conn.commit()\n       print(\"Table created successfully\")\n   except psycopg2.Error as e:\n       print(f\"Error creating table: {e}\")\n       conn.rollback()\n   ```\n\n5. **Insert sample records into the \"employees\" table:**\n\n   Prepare the SQL command for inserting data and execute it.\n\n   ```python\n   insert_queries = [\n       \"\"\"INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES ('Alice', 50000.0)\"\"\",\n       \"\"\"INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES ('Bob', 55000.0)\"\"\",\n       \"\"\"INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES ('Charlie', 60000.0)\"\"\"\n   ]\n\n   for query in insert_queries:\n       try:\n           cur.execute(query)\n           conn.commit()\n           print(\"Record inserted successfully\")\n       except psycopg2.Error as e:\n           print(f\"Error inserting record: {e}\")\n           conn.rollback()\n   ```\n\n6. **Close the cursor and connection:**\n\n   It's important to close the cursor and the connection once you're done to free up resources.\n\n   ```python\n   cur.close()\n   conn.close()\n   print(\"Database connection closed\")\n   ```\n\nPutting it all together, your complete Python script would look like this:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nimport sys\n\ntry:\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\n        database=\"your_database_name\",\n        user=\"your_username\",\n        password=\"your_password\",\n        host=\"your_host\",\n        port=\"your_port\"\n    )\n    print(\"Connected to the database successfully\")\nexcept psycopg2.Error as e:\n    print(f\"Error connecting to the database: {e}\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ncur = conn.cursor()\n\ncreate_table_query = '''\nCREATE TABLE employees (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    salary REAL NOT NULL\n)\n'''\ntry:\n    cur.execute(create_table_query)\n    conn.commit()\n    print(\"Table created successfully\")\nexcept psycopg2.Error as e:\n    print(f\"Error creating table: {e}\")\n    conn.rollback()\n\ninsert_queries = [\n    \"\"\"INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES ('Alice', 50000.0)\"\"\",\n    \"\"\"INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES ('Bob', 55000.0)\"\"\",\n    \"\"\"INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES ('Charlie', 60000.0)\"\"\"\n]\n\nfor query in insert_queries:\n    try:\n        cur.execute(query)\n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Record inserted successfully\")\n    except psycopg2.Error as e:\n        print(f\"Error inserting record: {e}\")\n        conn.rollback()\n\ncur.close()\nconn.close()\nprint(\"Database connection closed\")\n```\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- Replace `\"your_database_name\"`, `\"your_username\"`, `\"your_password\"`, `\"your_host\"`, and `\"your_port\"` with your actual database connection details.\n\n- The `id` column is defined as `SERIAL`, which automatically increments for each new record. If your PostgreSQL version doesn't support `SERIAL`, you can use `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`.\n\n- Ensure that the PostgreSQL server is running and accessible.\n\n- Handle exceptions appropriately to manage errors that may occur during database operations.\n\nThis script provides a basic example of connecting to a PostgreSQL database, creating a table, and inserting data. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to add more features, such as handling user input, performing more complex queries, or implementing transaction management."
