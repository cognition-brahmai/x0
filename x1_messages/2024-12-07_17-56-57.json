        "content": "So I have this problem here about a garden and a walkway. Let me see if I can figure this out. There's a rectangular garden that's 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. The owner wants to build a walkway around the entire garden that's 3 feet wide. I need to find out the area of this walkway in square feet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the walkway is. It's like a path that goes around the garden, right? So, it's surrounding the garden on all sides, and it's uniformly 3 feet wide everywhere.\n\nSo, if the garden is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, and the walkway is 3 feet wide all around, that means the walkway adds 3 feet to each side of the garden.\n\nWait, actually, since the walkway goes around the garden, it adds 3 feet to both sides of the length and both sides of the width. So, overall, the length would increase by 6 feet (3 feet on each end), and the width would increase by 6 feet as well (3 feet on each side).\n\nLet me visualize this. If I draw the garden as a rectangle, and then add the walkway around it, it's like having a bigger rectangle that encompasses both the garden and the walkway.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the entire area, including the garden and the walkway, would be:\n\nLength total = garden length + 2 * walkway width = 30 + 2*3 = 36 feet\n\nWidth total = garden width + 2 * walkway width = 20 + 2*3 = 26 feet\n\nNow, the area of the entire region, including the garden and the walkway, would be:\n\nArea total = length total * width total = 36 * 26\n\nBut, I need to find the area of just the walkway. So, to get that, I can subtract the area of the garden from the total area.\n\nArea of garden = length * width = 30 * 20 = 600 square feet\n\nArea of walkway = area total - area of garden\n\nSo, first, I need to calculate area total, which is 36 * 26.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n36 * 26:\n\n36 * 20 = 720\n\n36 * 6 = 216\n\n720 + 216 = 936\n\nSo, area total is 936 square feet.\n\nNow, area of walkway = 936 - 600 = 336 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nArea total = 36 * 26 = 936\n\nArea of garden = 30 * 20 = 600\n\nArea of walkway = 936 - 600 = 336\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the walkway as consisting of several parts. There's the part along the length, the part along the width, and the corners where they meet.\n\nBut, maybe that's more complicated. The way I did it initially seems straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I can verify it another way. Let's see.\n\nThe walkway is 3 feet wide around the entire garden. So, it's like a border around the garden.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the area of the outer rectangle and subtract the area of the inner rectangle (the garden).\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the perimeter of the garden and multiply by the width of the walkway, but that wouldn't account for the corners correctly.\n\nWait, actually, that might not give the exact area because the corners would be counted differently.\n\nNo, better to stick with the initial method.\n\nSo, the area of the walkway is 336 square feet.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider the walkway in parts.\n\nThere are two lengths and two widths.\n\nFor the lengths, each is 30 feet long, and the walkway is 3 feet wide, so each long side of the walkway would have an area of 30 * 3 = 90 square feet.\n\nBut, since there are two such sides, that's 2 * 90 = 180 square feet.\n\nFor the widths, each is 20 feet long, and the walkway is 3 feet wide, so each wide side would have an area of 20 * 3 = 60 square feet.\n\nAgain, two such sides, so 2 * 60 = 120 square feet.\n\nNow, adding those up: 180 + 120 = 300 square feet.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier (336 square feet).\n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nOh, I see. The problem is that this method doesn't account for the corners.\n\nIn the initial calculation, when I added the areas of the sides, I didn't include the corner sections where the walkway widens out.\n\nSo, actually, there are four corners, each of which is a square with side length equal to the walkway width, which is 3 feet.\n\nSo, area of each corner is 3 * 3 = 9 square feet.\n\nSince there are four corners, total corner area is 4 * 9 = 36 square feet.\n\nNow, if I add this to the previous total:\n\n300 (from the sides) + 36 (from the corners) = 336 square feet.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, that makes sense now.\n\nAlternatively, sticking with the initial method is simpler: calculate the total area including the walkway, subtract the area of the garden, and you get the area of the walkway.\n\nTherefore, the area of the walkway is indeed 336 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{336} \\]"
