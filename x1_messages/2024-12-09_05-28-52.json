        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many adults and how many children there are in the city.\n\nThe city has a total population of 200,000 people. According to the information, 55% of them are adults. So, to find the number of adults, we can calculate 55% of 200,000.\n\nNumber of adults = 55% of 200,000\n                  = (55/100) * 200,000\n                  = 0.55 * 200,000\n                  = 110,000 adults\n\nNow, the rest of the population are children. So, to find the number of children, we can subtract the number of adults from the total population.\n\nNumber of children = Total population - Number of adults\n                   = 200,000 - 110,000\n                   = 90,000 children\n\nNext, we're told that 75% of the adult population has received a vaccine. So, let's find out how many adults have been vaccinated.\n\nNumber of vaccinated adults = 75% of 110,000\n                            = (75/100) * 110,000\n                            = 0.75 * 110,000\n                            = 82,500 vaccinated adults\n\nNow, to find out how many people have not been vaccinated, we need to consider both adults and children. Since only adults have received vaccines, all children are unvaccinated.\n\nSo, the total number of unvaccinated people is the sum of unvaccinated adults and all children.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of unvaccinated adults.\n\nNumber of unvaccinated adults = Total adults - Vaccinated adults\n                              = 110,000 - 82,500\n                              = 27,500 unvaccinated adults\n\nNow, add the number of unvaccinated adults to the number of children to get the total unvaccinated population.\n\nTotal unvaccinated people = Unvaccinated adults + Children\n                          = 27,500 + 90,000\n                          = 117,500 people\n\nSo, 117,500 people in the city have not been vaccinated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{117500} \\]"
