        "content": "So the company is currently spending $5000 per month on office supplies, and they want to reduce that by 15% through some cost-saving measures. We need to find out how much they'll save in a year.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much they're saving each month. If they reduce their spending by 15%, that means they're saving 15% of $5000 each month.\n\nTo calculate 15% of $5000, I can multiply 5000 by 0.15.\n\nSo, $5000 * 0.15 = $750.\n\nThat means they're saving $750 each month.\n\nNow, to find out how much they save in a year, I need to multiply the monthly savings by 12, since there are 12 months in a year.\n\nSo, $750 * 12 = $9000.\n\nTherefore, the company will save $9000 in a year.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nOriginal monthly spending: $5000.\n\nReduction: 15% of $5000, which is $750.\n\nSo, new monthly spending: $5000 - $750 = $4250.\n\nTherefore, savings per month: $750.\n\nOver a year: $750 * 12 = $9000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the annual savings directly.\n\nFirst, find the annual spending before cost-saving measures.\n\nMonthly spending: $5000.\n\nAnnual spending: $5000 * 12 = $60,000.\n\nNow, they're reducing spending by 15%.\n\nSo, savings: 15% of $60,000.\n\n$60,000 * 0.15 = $9000.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, either way, the company will save $9000 in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9000} \\]"
