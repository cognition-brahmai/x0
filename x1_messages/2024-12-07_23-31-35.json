        "content": "So the factory originally produces 1000 units of product A every day, and it takes 10 days to fill a shipment container. That means the total capacity of the shipment container is 1000 units/day * 10 days = 10,000 units.\n\nNow, the factory decides to double its production capacity. So, its new daily production is 1000 units/day * 2 = 2000 units/day.\n\nTo find out how many days it takes to fill the same shipment container with the new production rate, we can divide the total container capacity by the new daily production:\n\n10,000 units / 2000 units/day = 5 days.\n\nSo, it now takes 5 days to fill a shipment container.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
