        "content": "Let's see. I have this store that offers discounts for buying multiple items. The more items you buy, the bigger the discount. Specifically:\n\n- Buy 2 items, get 10% off\n\n- Buy 3 items, get 20% off\n\n- Buy 4 or more items, get 30% off\n\nEach item costs $50. I need to find out how much I would save by purchasing 5 items instead of just 1.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total cost without any discount. If I buy 1 item, it's straightforward: 1 \u00d7 $50 = $50.\n\nNow, if I buy 5 items without any discount, it would be 5 \u00d7 $50 = $250.\n\nBut since there's a discount for buying 4 or more items, I can get 30% off on the total price when I buy 5 items.\n\nSo, the discount on 5 items is 30% of $250.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n30% of $250 is (30/100) \u00d7 250 = 0.3 \u00d7 250 = $75.\n\nTherefore, the total cost after discount for 5 items is $250 - $75 = $175.\n\nNow, if I buy just 1 item, it's $50 with no discount.\n\nSo, the savings by purchasing 5 items instead of 1 would be the difference between the cost of 5 items without discount minus the cost of 5 items with discount, but wait, that's $250 - $175 = $75.\n\nBut the question is about how much I save by purchasing 5 items instead of just 1.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps it's the difference between buying 5 items with discount versus buying 1 item without discount.\n\nSo, buying 5 items with discount costs $175, and buying 1 item costs $50.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in terms of savings because you're comparing different quantities.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of per item cost.\n\nLet's see:\n\nCost per item when buying 5 items: $175 / 5 = $35 per item.\n\nCost per item when buying 1 item: $50.\n\nSo, savings per item when buying 5 items instead of 1 is $50 - $35 = $15 per item.\n\nSince I'm buying 5 items, total savings would be 5 \u00d7 $15 = $75.\n\nWait, but earlier I also got $75 as the discount amount.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, by purchasing 5 items instead of 1, I save $75.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nTotal cost for 5 items with 30% discount: $250 - 30% of $250 = $250 - $75 = $175.\n\nTotal cost for 1 item with no discount: $50.\n\nBut I feel like I'm missing something here.\n\nMaybe the question is asking about the absolute savings by choosing to buy 5 items with discount versus buying them individually without discount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the savings per item.\n\nWait, the question is: \"how much would you save by purchasing 5 items instead of just 1?\"\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf I buy 1 item, it costs $50.\n\nIf I buy 5 items with discount, it costs $175.\n\nSo, the savings would be the difference between what 5 items would cost without discount minus what 5 items cost with discount.\n\nThat is, 5 \u00d7 $50 = $250 minus $175 = $75.\n\nSo, I save $75 by buying 5 items with discount compared to buying them individually without discount.\n\nBut the question mentions \"instead of just 1.\"\n\nMaybe it's asking how much I save per item or in total.\n\nWait, perhaps it's asking how much I save in total by buying 5 with discount instead of buying them one by one without discount.\n\nIn that case, yes, $75 is the total savings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking how much I save per item.\n\nIn that case, $15 per item, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut the question seems to be asking for total savings.\n\nSo, I think the answer is $75.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider another approach.\n\nIf I buy 5 items with 30% discount, I pay 70% of the total price.\n\nTotal price without discount: 5 \u00d7 $50 = $250.\n\nWith 30% discount: $250 \u00d7 0.7 = $175.\n\nSo, savings: $250 - $175 = $75.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, by purchasing 5 items instead of just 1, you save $75.\n\nWait a minute, but buying 5 items with discount saves $75 compared to buying 5 items without discount.\n\nBut the question says \"instead of just 1.\"\n\nMaybe it's trying to compare buying 5 with discount versus buying 1 without discount.\n\nThat doesn't make much sense because you're getting 5 items in one case and only 1 in the other.\n\nProbably, the intention is to compare the cost of buying 5 with discount versus buying 5 without discount, which is the $75 savings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking how much you save per item and then total.\n\nPer item savings: $50 - $35 = $15.\n\nTotal savings for 5 items: 5 \u00d7 $15 = $75.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the answer should be $75.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's think about it in terms of unit price.\n\nWithout discount, each item is $50.\n\nWith discount, each item is $35.\n\nSo, for each item, I save $15.\n\nFor 5 items, that's $75.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, by purchasing 5 items instead of just 1, you save $75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
