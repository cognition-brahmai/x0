        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is:\n\n((7 - 2)^2 * 4 + 12) / 6\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n(7 - 2) = 5\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n(5^2 * 4 + 12) / 6\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n5^2 = 25\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n(25 * 4 + 12) / 6\n\nThen, multiplication:\n\n25 * 4 = 100\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(100 + 12) / 6\n\nAddition:\n\n100 + 12 = 112\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n112 / 6\n\nFinally, division:\n\n112 / 6 = 18.666...\n\nOr, as a fraction, it's 56/3.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 18.67 or exactly 56/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{56}{3}} \\]"
