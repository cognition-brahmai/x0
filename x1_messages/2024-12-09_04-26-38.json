        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. The problem says I pick one ball, replace it, and then pick another ball. I need to find the probability that both balls are red.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. There are two events: picking the first ball and picking the second ball. Since the ball is replaced after the first pick, the two events are independent. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the outcome of the second pick.\n\nNow, for independent events, the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So, if I can find the probability of picking a red ball on the first pick and the probability of picking a red ball on the second pick, then multiply them together, that should give me the answer.\n\nLet's find the probability of picking a red ball on the first pick. There are 4 red balls out of a total of 10 balls, so the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nSince the ball is replaced, the total number of balls remains the same for the second pick. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second pick is also 4/10 or 2/5.\n\nNow, to find the probability of both events happening, I multiply the two probabilities together: (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check this. Is there any other way to approach this problem to confirm that my answer is correct?\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider all possible outcomes. Since each pick is independent and there are two picks, there are a total of 10 * 10 = 100 possible outcomes (10 choices for the first pick and 10 for the second).\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick a red ball both times. Since there are 4 red balls, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 16/100, which simplifies to 4/25.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 4/25.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. The problem mentions that the ball is replaced, so the probabilities remain constant for each pick. If the ball wasn't replaced, the events would be dependent, and I'd have to adjust the probabilities accordingly. But in this case, since it's with replacement, my earlier approach is correct.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not confusing this with the probability of getting at least one red ball or some other scenario. The problem specifically asks for the probability that both balls are red, which is what I've calculated.\n\nLet me also consider the general formula for independent events. If event A and event B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). In this case, event A is picking a red ball on the first pick, and event B is picking a red ball on the second pick. Both have probability 2/5, so P(A and B) = (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25.\n\nEverything seems to align here. I think I've got the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}} \\]"
