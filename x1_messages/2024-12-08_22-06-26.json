        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular garden that's 30 feet by 40 feet, and we need to build a walkway around it with a uniform width. The area of just the walkway is 600 square feet, and we need to find out what the width of this walkway should be.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the setup. We have a rectangle that's 30 ft by 40 ft, and we're going to build a walkway around it that has the same width all around. So, the walkway would add some extra width to all four sides of the garden.\n\nLet's denote the width of the walkway as \\(w\\). Since the walkway goes around the garden uniformly, it adds \\(w\\) feet to each side of the garden. That means the total length of the garden plus the walkway would be \\(40 + 2w\\) feet (because the walkway adds \\(w\\) feet to both the left and right sides). Similarly, the total width would be \\(30 + 2w\\) feet (adding \\(w\\) feet to both the top and bottom).\n\nNow, the area of the entire garden plus the walkway would be \\((40 + 2w) \\times (30 + 2w)\\) square feet.\n\nThe area of just the garden is \\(40 \\times 30 = 1200\\) square feet.\n\nThe area of the walkway is the total area minus the garden area, which is given as 600 square feet. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[(40 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 1200 = 600\\]\n\nLet's expand the left side:\n\n\\[(40 \\times 30) + (40 \\times 2w) + (30 \\times 2w) + (2w \\times 2w) - 1200 = 600\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[1200 + 80w + 60w + 4w^2 - 1200 = 600\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[4w^2 + 140w = 600\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check the expansion.\n\nActually, \\( (40 + 2w)(30 + 2w) \\) should be:\n\n\\[40 \\times 30 = 1200\\]\\[40 \\times 2w = 80w\\]\\[30 \\times 2w = 60w\\]\\[2w \\times 2w = 4w^2\\]\n\nSo, adding them up: \\(1200 + 80w + 60w + 4w^2\\), which is \\(1200 + 140w + 4w^2\\).\n\nSubtracting the garden area (1200) gives:\n\n\\[1200 + 140w + 4w^2 - 1200 = 4w^2 + 140w\\]\n\nSetting this equal to the walkway area:\n\n\\[4w^2 + 140w = 600\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\(w\\). First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 4:\n\n\\[w^2 + 35w = 150\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. To solve it, we can rearrange it into standard form:\n\n\\[w^2 + 35w - 150 = 0\\]\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 35\\), and \\(c = -150\\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{-35 \\pm \\sqrt{35^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-150)}}{2 \\times 1}\\]\\[w = \\frac{-35 \\pm \\sqrt{1225 + 600}}{2}\\]\\[w = \\frac{-35 \\pm \\sqrt{1825}}{2}\\]\n\nHmm, \\(\\sqrt{1825}\\) seems a bit messy. Let's see if we can simplify it.\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\(\\sqrt{1825}\\). 1825 divided by 25 is 73, so \\(\\sqrt{1825} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 73} = 5\\sqrt{73}\\).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{-35 \\pm 5\\sqrt{73}}{2}\\]\n\nThis gives us two potential solutions:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{-35 + 5\\sqrt{73}}{2}\\]\\[w = \\frac{-35 - 5\\sqrt{73}}{2}\\]\n\nSince width cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. So, the width of the walkway is:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{-35 + 5\\sqrt{73}}{2}\\]\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the area of the walkway. The total area including the walkway is \\((40 + 2w)(30 + 2w)\\), and the area of the garden is \\(40 \\times 30 = 1200\\). So, the area of the walkway is:\n\n\\[(40 + 2w)(30 + 2w) - 1200 = 600\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[(40 + 2w)(30 + 2w) = 1800\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[1200 + 80w + 60w + 4w^2 = 1800\\]\\[4w^2 + 140w + 1200 = 1800\\]\n\nSubtracting 1800 from both sides:\n\n\\[4w^2 + 140w + 1200 - 1800 = 0\\]\\[4w^2 + 140w - 600 = 0\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 4 to simplify:\n\n\\[w^2 + 35w - 150 = 0\\]\n\nThis is the same quadratic equation as before. So, the solution remains:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{-35 \\pm \\sqrt{35^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-150)}}{2}\\]\\[w = \\frac{-35 \\pm \\sqrt{1225 + 600}}{2}\\]\\[w = \\frac{-35 \\pm \\sqrt{1825}}{2}\\]\\[w = \\frac{-35 \\pm 5\\sqrt{73}}{2}\\]\n\nSince width can't be negative, we take the positive value:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{-35 + 5\\sqrt{73}}{2}\\]\n\nLet\u2019s approximate this value. First, \\(\\sqrt{73}\\) is approximately 8.544 (since \\(8.544^2 \\approx 73\\)).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[w = \\frac{-35 + 5 \\times 8.544}{2}\\]\\[w = \\frac{-35 + 42.72}{2}\\]\\[w = \\frac{7.72}{2}\\]\\[w = 3.86\\]\n\nSo, the width of the walkway is approximately 3.86 feet.\n\nBut let's verify this solution to make sure it's accurate. If \\(w = 3.86\\) feet, then the total length is \\(40 + 2 \\times 3.86 = 47.72\\) feet, and the total width is \\(30 + 2 \\times 3.86 = 37.72\\) feet. The area of the entire setup is \\(47.72 \\times 37.72 \\approx 1800.01\\) square feet, which is very close to 1800 square feet, confirming that the walkway area is indeed 600 square feet (since the garden is 1200 square feet).\n\nTherefore, the width of the walkway is approximately 3.86 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
