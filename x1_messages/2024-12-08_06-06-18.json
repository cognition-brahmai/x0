        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is ((3^2 - 4) * 2 + 6) / 3. First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right. This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting inside the parentheses: (3^2 - 4). I need to calculate 3 squared first because exponents come before subtraction. 3 squared is 9, so that gives me (9 - 4), which is 5. Now the expression is (5 * 2 + 6) / 3.\n\nNext, within the parentheses, I have multiplication and addition: 5 * 2 + 6. Multiplication comes before addition, so 5 * 2 is 10, and then 10 + 6 is 16. Now the expression is 16 / 3.\n\nFinally, 16 divided by 3 is approximately 5.333..., or more precisely, 5 and 1/3.\n\nSo, the answer is 16/3 or approximately 5.333."
