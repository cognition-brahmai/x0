        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual revenue of $1,200,000. It spends 40% on salaries, 30% on rent and utilities, and 10% on marketing. I need to find out how much profit it makes after these expenses.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much is spent on each category.\n\nSalaries: 40% of $1,200,000.\n\nRent and utilities: 30% of $1,200,000.\n\nMarketing: 10% of $1,200,000.\n\nThen, I'll add up these expenses and subtract the total from the revenue to find the profit.\n\nLet me start with salaries.\n\n40% of $1,200,000 is calculated as 0.40 multiplied by 1,200,000.\n\n0.40 * 1,200,000 = 480,000.\n\nSo, salaries cost $480,000.\n\nNext, rent and utilities at 30% of $1,200,000.\n\n0.30 * 1,200,000 = 360,000.\n\nRent and utilities cost $360,000.\n\nThen, marketing at 10% of $1,200,000.\n\n0.10 * 1,200,000 = 120,000.\n\nMarketing costs $120,000.\n\nNow, I'll add up these expenses:\n\nSalaries: $480,000\n\nRent and utilities: $360,000\n\nMarketing: $120,000\n\nTotal expenses = 480,000 + 360,000 + 120,000.\n\nLet's add those up.\n\n480,000 + 360,000 = 840,000\n\n840,000 + 120,000 = 960,000\n\nSo, total expenses are $960,000.\n\nNow, subtract the total expenses from the revenue to find the profit.\n\nRevenue: $1,200,000\n\nExpenses: $960,000\n\nProfit = 1,200,000 - 960,000 = 240,000\n\nTherefore, the company makes a profit of $240,000 after these expenses.\n\nWait a minute, is that all?\n\nLet me double-check if there are any other expenses mentioned.\n\nThe question mentions spends on salaries, rent and utilities, and marketing, which total up to 40% + 30% + 10% = 80% of the revenue.\n\nBut, 80% of $1,200,000 is $960,000, and subtracting that from the revenue gives $240,000, which is 20% of the revenue.\n\nIs there any other information or other expenses I should consider?\n\nThe question seems to provide all the necessary information and doesn't mention any other expenses. So, I think $240,000 is the correct profit after the specified expenses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other expenses not accounted for, but according to the question, only salaries, rent and utilities, and marketing are mentioned.\n\nSo, I'll go with $240,000 as the profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240000} \\]"
