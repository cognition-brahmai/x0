        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"A hen lays 6 eggs in a week. How many eggs will 15 hens lay in a year? Show your reasoning.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to find out how many eggs one hen lays in a week, which is given as 6 eggs. So, one hen lays 6 eggs per week.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many eggs 15 hens would lay in a year. To do this, I think I should first find out how many eggs one hen lays in a year and then multiply that by 15.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many eggs one hen lays in a year.\n\nI know that there are 52 weeks in a year (well, technically 52.1429, but for simplicity, I'll use 52).\n\nSo, if one hen lays 6 eggs per week, then in a year, one hen would lay:\n\n6 eggs/week * 52 weeks/year = 312 eggs/year\n\nNow, if I have 15 hens, then the total number of eggs would be:\n\n312 eggs/year * 15 hens = 4680 eggs/year\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should check if there's another way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of eggs laid per week by 15 hens and then multiply by the number of weeks in a year.\n\nSo, if one hen lays 6 eggs per week, then 15 hens would lay:\n\n6 eggs/week/hen * 15 hens = 90 eggs/week\n\nNow, over a year, that would be:\n\n90 eggs/week * 52 weeks/year = 4680 eggs/year\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. Good, that gives me more confidence in the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors I should consider. For example, do hens lay eggs at the same rate throughout the year? Might there be variations due to seasonal changes, lighting, or other factors?\n\nIn real life, egg-laying rates can be affected by factors such as daylight, nutrition, and age. However, since this is a math problem, I'll assume that the hens lay eggs at a constant rate throughout the year.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any leap years involved, which would add an extra day. But since we're using weeks, and a year is approximately 52 weeks, I don't think the extra day would significantly affect the calculation.\n\nSo, sticking with the original approach, I'll go with 4680 eggs per year for 15 hens.\n\nWait, but just to be extra sure, let's double-check the multiplication.\n\nFirst calculation:\n\n6 eggs/week/hen * 52 weeks/year = 312 eggs/year/hen\n\n312 eggs/year/hen * 15 hens = 4680 eggs/year\n\nSecond calculation:\n\n6 eggs/week/hen * 15 hens = 90 eggs/week\n\n90 eggs/week * 52 weeks/year = 4680 eggs/year\n\nBoth methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 4680 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, 15 hens will lay 4680 eggs in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4680} \\]"
