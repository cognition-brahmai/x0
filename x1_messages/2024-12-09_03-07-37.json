        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if three painters can paint a house in 12 days, how many painters would be needed to paint the same house in 6 days? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of painters and the time it takes to paint the house. It seems like if you have more painters, they can get the job done faster. So, there's an inverse relationship between the number of painters and the time required.\n\nLet me try to think of it in terms of work done. If three painters take 12 days, then the total amount of work to paint the house can be thought of as 3 painters times 12 days, which is 36 painter-days. So, the work required to paint the house is 36 painter-days.\n\nNow, if I want to paint the house in 6 days, I need to find out how many painters I need such that their total work equals 36 painter-days. Let's let \\( p \\) be the number of painters needed. Then, \\( p \\) painters working for 6 days would do \\( p \\times 6 \\) painter-days of work.\n\nSince the total work required is 36 painter-days, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ p \\times 6 = 36 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( p \\):\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, I would need 6 painters to paint the house in 6 days.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If three painters take 12 days, and I'm halving the time to 6 days, it makes sense that I would need twice as many painters, right? Because if you have twice as many painters working together, they should be able to finish in half the time, assuming they all work at the same rate.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, doubling the number of painters from 3 to 6 should halve the time from 12 days to 6 days.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of work rates. If three painters can paint the house in 12 days, then the combined work rate of the three painters is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of the house per day.\n\nSo, the work rate per painter is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\div 3 = \\frac{1}{36} \\) of the house per day.\n\nNow, if I have \\( p \\) painters, each working at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{36} \\) per day, their combined work rate is \\( p \\times \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{p}{36} \\) of the house per day.\n\nIf I want them to paint the entire house in 6 days, their combined work rate should be \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the house per day.\n\nSo, set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{p}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( p \\):\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\]\n\nAgain, I get that I need 6 painters.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 3 painters take 12 days, then the ratio of painters to days is 3:12, which simplifies to 1:4. So, one painter would take 4 times as long, which is 48 days.\n\nNow, if I want to paint the house in 6 days, I need to find out how many painters are needed to reduce the time from 48 days to 6 days.\n\nSo, the number of painters required would be \\( \\frac{48}{6} = 8 \\) painters.\n\nWait, that doesn't match my previous answer of 6 painters. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me re-examine this approach. If one painter takes 48 days, then to complete the job in 6 days, I would need \\( \\frac{48}{6} = 8 \\) painters.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated that 6 painters are needed. So, which one is correct?\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in one of the methods. Let's check the first method again.\n\nTotal work is 3 painters \u00d7 12 days = 36 painter-days.\n\nTo complete in 6 days: \\( p \\times 6 = 36 \\) \u2192 \\( p = 6 \\).\n\nIn the second method, work rate per painter is \\( \\frac{1}{36} \\) per day.\n\nFor \\( p \\) painters: \\( \\frac{p}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\) \u2192 \\( p = 6 \\).\n\nIn the third method, one painter takes 48 days, so for 6 days, \\( \\frac{48}{6} = 8 \\) painters.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that one painter takes 48 days. Let's verify that.\n\nIf three painters take 12 days, then one painter would take 3 times as long, since there are three of them working together. So, one painter would take \\( 12 \\times 3 = 36 \\) days, not 48.\n\nOh, I see where I went wrong. It should be 36 days, not 48.\n\nSo, one painter takes 36 days. To complete the job in 6 days, I would need \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) painters.\n\nNow, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 6 painters.\n\nEarlier, I mistakenly thought that one painter would take 48 days, but actually, it's 36 days.\n\nTherefore, to paint the house in 6 days, you need 6 painters.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Three painters take 12 days.\n\n- One painter would take 36 days.\n\n- To paint in 6 days, need 6 painters.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Total work is 3 painters \u00d7 12 days = 36 painter-days.\n\n- To complete in 6 days: \\( p \\times 6 = 36 \\) \u2192 \\( p = 6 \\).\n\nOr:\n\n- Work rate per painter: \\( \\frac{1}{36} \\) per day.\n\n- Combined work rate for \\( p \\) painters: \\( \\frac{p}{36} \\) per day.\n\n- To complete in 6 days: \\( \\frac{p}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\) \u2192 \\( p = 6 \\).\n\nAll methods now confirm that 6 painters are needed to paint the house in 6 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
