        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to design a SQL query that fetches the top 5 highest-rated movies from a database. There are two tables involved: \"movies\" and \"reviews\". The \"movies\" table has columns for id, title, release_year, and rating, while the \"reviews\" table has columns for id, movie_id, reviewer_name, review_text, and rating.\n\nSo, the goal is to select the top 5 movies based on their average ratings, and for each of these movies, I need to include the title, the average rating, and the total number of reviews.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how these two tables are related. It looks like the \"reviews\" table has a \"movie_id\" column that links to the \"id\" column in the \"movies\" table. This is a typical one-to-many relationship, where one movie can have multiple reviews.\n\nTo get the average rating and the total number of reviews for each movie, I'll need to join these two tables on the movie_id column. Then, I can group the results by movie id and calculate the average of the ratings and count the number of reviews for each movie.\n\nAfter that, I can order the results by the average rating in descending order and limit the output to the top 5 movies.\n\nLet me think about the SQL syntax for this.\n\nFirst, the JOIN operation: I need to join \"movies\" and \"reviews\" on movies.id = reviews.movie_id.\n\nThen, I need to group the results by movies.id, title, and maybe release_year, but since the query only asks for title, average rating, and total number of reviews, I can group by movies.id and title.\n\nNext, calculate the average rating and count the number of reviews for each movie.\n\nFinally, order the results by the average rating descending and limit to top 5.\n\nAlso, I should consider handling cases where a movie has no reviews. If a movie has no reviews, it shouldn't appear in the results since there would be no ratings to average.\n\nBut according to the task, the query should include only movies that have reviews, as we need to calculate the average rating based on reviews.\n\nSo, I don't need to include movies with no reviews.\n\nLet me try to write a draft of the query.\n\nSELECT \n\nmovies.title,\n\nAVG(reviews.rating) AS average_rating,\n\nCOUNT(reviews.id) AS total_reviews\n\nFROM \n\nmovies\n\nJOIN \n\nreviews ON movies.id = reviews.movie_id\n\nGROUP BY \n\nmovies.id, movies.title\n\nORDER BY \n\naverage_rating DESC\n\nLIMIT 5;\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But I should check if this covers all the requirements.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n- Does it select the top 5 movies based on average rating? Yes, by ordering descending and limiting to 5.\n\n- Does it include the movie title, average rating, and total number of reviews? Yes, selected columns are title, average_rating, and total_reviews.\n\n- Does it correctly join the movies and reviews tables? Yes, joining on movies.id = reviews.movie_id.\n\n- Does it handle grouping correctly? Grouping by movies.id and movies.title should be sufficient.\n\n- What if a movie has multiple reviews? The AVG and COUNT functions should work correctly for grouped records.\n\n- Are there any potential issues with NULL values? If reviews.rating can be NULL, AVG function will ignore NULLs, but I should ensure that ratings are not NULL in the reviews table.\n\nAssuming that the ratings in the reviews table are always provided and not NULL, this query should work fine.\n\nAlternatively, to make it more robust, I could add a condition to exclude any reviews with NULL ratings, but according to the table schema provided, ratings are likely to be numeric and required.\n\nIf needed, I could add a WHERE clause like WHERE reviews.rating IS NOT NULL, but it's probably unnecessary.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any indexing considerations for performance, but since this is a design query and not a performance optimization task, I can overlook that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if there are any movies with the same average rating. In such cases, the ORDER BY will arrange them together, and the LIMIT 5 will select the top 5 based on the average rating. If there are more movies with the same rating as the fifth one, they might be excluded, depending on the SQL implementation's handling of ties in ordering.\n\nBut since the task is to get the top 5, this should be acceptable.\n\nI think this query meets the requirements.\n\nWait a minute, the \"movies\" table also has a \"rating\" column. But in the task description, it says that the \"movies\" table has columns id, title, release_year, and rating, and the \"reviews\" table has columns id, movie_id, reviewer_name, review_text, and rating.\n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the correct rating column. The task is to retrieve the top 5 highest-rated movies based on reviews, so I should be using the rating from the \"reviews\" table, not the \"rating\" column in the \"movies\" table.\n\nTherefore, my query is correct in using reviews.rating to calculate the average rating for each movie.\n\nIf the \"movies\" rating column is something else, like a pre-assigned rating, it's not relevant for this query.\n\nJust to confirm, I'll check the table structures again.\n\n\"movies\" table: id, title, release_year, rating\n\n\"reviews\" table: id, movie_id, reviewer_name, review_text, rating\n\nAssuming that the \"rating\" in the \"reviews\" table is the reviewer's rating for the movie, that's the one I need to use.\n\nSo, my query is correct.\n\nLet me also consider if there is any need to handle different types of ratings, like different scales, but since it's all within the same database and presumably consistent, I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that the query is efficient, but again, for the purpose of this task, the simple join and group by should be sufficient.\n\nI don't think there's any need for subqueries or anything more complex here.\n\nTherefore, the final query is:\n\nSELECT \n\nmovies.title,\n\nAVG(reviews.rating) AS average_rating,\n\nCOUNT(reviews.id) AS total_reviews\n\nFROM \n\nmovies\n\nJOIN \n\nreviews ON movies.id = reviews.movie_id\n\nGROUP BY \n\nmovies.id, movies.title\n\nORDER BY \n\naverage_rating DESC\n\nLIMIT 5;\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\n**Final Query:**\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    movies.title,\n    AVG(reviews.rating) AS average_rating,\n    COUNT(reviews.id) AS total_reviews\nFROM \n    movies\nJOIN \n    reviews ON movies.id = reviews.movie_id\nGROUP BY \n    movies.id, movies.title\nORDER BY \n    average_rating DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\n"
