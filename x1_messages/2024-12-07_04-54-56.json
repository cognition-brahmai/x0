        "content": "I need to choose the right function and set its parameters based on what the user asked. The user wants to count how many times the term 'AI' appears in their document. So, I need to find a function that can handle text analysis or counting occurrences in a document.\n\nLooking at the available functions:\n\n1. **document_analytics**:\n\n- Description: Useful for performing various aggregations, counts, etc. from document data.\n\n- Params: action (like \"count\", \"filter\", \"grouped_count\"), filters (column, value, expression).\n\nThis seems promising because it mentions counts and aggregations on document data.\n\n2. **search**:\n\n- Description: Helps find information by converting the input query into search terms and filters.\n\n- Parameters: search_terms, alternatives, date_range.\n\nThis might be useful for finding information but doesn't directly suggest counting occurrences.\n\n3. **email_filter**:\n\n- Description: Helps filter emails based on sender, recipient, subject, or content.\n\n- Params: action (like \"sender\", \"recipient\", \"subject\", \"content\"), keyword.\n\nThis is specific to email filtering and doesn't seem relevant for counting terms in a document.\n\nGiven this, **document_analytics** is the most suitable function for the task.\n\nNow, I need to set the parameters for **document_analytics**. The user wants to count how many times 'AI' appears, so the action should be \"count\". Additionally, I need to specify what to count, which is the term 'AI'.\n\nLooking at the params for **document_analytics**:\n\n- action: Should be \"count\".\n\n- filters: This seems optional for just counting occurrences of a term.\n\nBut, in the description, it mentions \"aggregations, counts, etc. from document data.\" It's a bit vague whether it can count specific terms or if it's for counting records based on certain filters.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps \"action\": \"count\" is for counting records, and to count occurrences of a term within the text, I need a different action, like \"term_frequency\" or something similar.\n\nBut looking at the provided params, there's no \"term_frequency\" option. Maybe \"grouped_count\" could be used to count occurrences of different terms, but the user is interested in a specific term, 'AI'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"filter\" with \"expression\" to count occurrences where the term is 'AI'.\n\nBut this still feels a bit off. Maybe **document_analytics** isn't the best fit after all.\n\nLet me consider the **search** function again. Although it's designed for searching information, perhaps I can use it to find all instances of 'AI' in the document and then count them.\n\nBut the **search** function seems more geared towards retrieving information based on search terms rather than counting occurrences.\n\nComparing the two, **document_analytics** is still a better choice, even if it's not perfectly clear how to use it for term counting.\n\nI'll proceed with **document_analytics**, setting \"action\": \"count\" and including a filter to specify the term 'AI'.\n\nBut to make it clearer, perhaps I can set \"action\": \"count\" and include a filter with \"column\": \"text\" (assuming the document text is in a 'text' column) and \"value\": \"AI\".\n\nWait, but 'AI' might appear multiple times within the text field, and a simple filter might only count the number of records where 'AI' appears, not the number of times it appears in total.\n\nThis is a problem. I need a way to count all occurrences across the entire document, not just count the number of sections or records containing 'AI'.\n\nMaybe **document_analytics** isn't designed for this level of text analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to use regular expressions or some text processing to achieve this.\n\nBut looking back at the available functions and their parameters, nothing jumps out as explicitly supporting term frequency counts.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll have to make do with **document_analytics** and specify \"action\": \"count\" with a filter for \"value\": \"AI\".\n\nIt's not perfect, but it's the best option available.\n\nSo, my response in JSON format would be:\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"document_analytics\",\n\n\"params\": {\n\n\"action\": \"count\",\n\n\"filters\": {\n\n\"column\": \"text\",\n\n\"value\": \"AI\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nBut I'm not entirely satisfied with this approach because it might not count multiple occurrences within the same text field. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can set \"action\": \"grouped_count\" and group by the term 'AI', but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, if \"action\": \"count\" counts the number of records where 'AI' appears, perhaps I need to set \"action\": \"sum\" or something similar to count occurrences.\n\nBut \"sum\" isn't listed in the available actions.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I need to preprocess the text to split it into words and then count the occurrences of 'AI'.\n\nBut again, with the given functions, I don't see a way to preprocess the text in such a manner.\n\nPerhaps I need to accept that **document_analytics** with \"action\": \"count\" and a filter for 'AI' is the closest I can get, even if it doesn't count multiple occurrences per text field.\n\nAlternatively, if the document is treated as a single text field, then counting the number of times 'AI' appears should work, assuming it's not just counting the number of records.\n\nBut without more clarity on how the document is structured, this is the best I can do.\n\nSo, my final response is:\n\n{\n\n\"function\": \"document_analytics\",\n\n\"params\": {\n\n\"action\": \"count\",\n\n\"filters\": {\n\n\"column\": \"text\",\n\n\"value\": \"AI\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```json\n\n{\n\n  \"function\": \"document_analytics\",\n\n  \"params\": {\n\n    \"action\": \"count\",\n\n    \"filters\": {\n\n      \"column\": \"text\",\n\n      \"value\": \"AI\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n```"
