No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe \"The Band\" formed in 1968 is what you're thinking of, but that doesn't match the clue about being formed in 1973. Let me think differently. Could it be \"America,\" the rock band formed in 1970? No, that's not it. Another thought: maybe \"America's Favorite Ambassadors,\" but that seems too long and not matching the clue. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The vehicle used for emergency medical transportation is an ambulance, and there might be a rock band named Ambulance formed in 1973. I'll try to look that up. According to my knowledge, there was a band called \"Ambulance\" formed in 1973, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe you can provide a bit more information or check the details again? I want to make sure I'm giving you the correct answer."
