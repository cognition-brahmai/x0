        "content": "Okay, so Jane bought 3 packs of marbles, and each pack has 12 marbles. So first, I need to find out how many marbles she had in total before she lost any.\n\nTo do that, I'll multiply the number of packs by the number of marbles in each pack. So, 3 packs times 12 marbles per pack:\n\n3 \u00d7 12 = 36 marbles.\n\nSo, Jane originally had 36 marbles.\n\nNow, she lost some marbles and now has 23 marbles left. I need to find out how many she lost.\n\nTo find that, I can subtract the number of marbles she has left from the original number of marbles.\n\nSo, 36 (original marbles) minus 23 (marbles left):\n\n36 - 23 = 13 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Jane lost 13 marbles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nShe had 36 marbles initially, lost some, and now has 23. Yes, 36 minus 23 is indeed 13.\n\nSo, the answer is she lost 13 marbles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as she lost some marbles, and now has 23 left. If I let the number of marbles lost be x, then:\n\n36 - x = 23.\n\nThen, solving for x:\n\nx = 36 - 23,\n\nWhich again gives x = 13.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the answer is still 13 marbles lost.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. No need to overcomplicate it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
