        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 150 widgets per hour, but they take a 10-minute break after each hour of production. So, in an 8-hour shift, I need to account for both the production time and the break times to find out the total number of widgets produced.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much actual production time there is in an 8-hour shift, considering the breaks.\n\nEach hour of production is followed by a 10-minute break. So, for every hour of work, there's an additional 10 minutes of break time.\n\nBut in an 8-hour shift, do they take a break after every hour of production, or is the break time included in the shift?\n\nI think the breaks are taken during the shift, so the total shift time includes both production time and break time.\n\nWait, the question says \"after each hour, they take a break and production stops for 10 minutes.\" So, for every hour of production, there's a 10-minute break.\n\nBut in an 8-hour shift, if they take a 10-minute break after each hour, then over 8 hours, they would take 8 breaks of 10 minutes each.\n\nWait, but the last hour of production might not be followed by a break, depending on the shift schedule.\n\nHmm, let me think differently.\n\nLet's consider the production and break cycles.\n\nEach cycle consists of 1 hour of production plus a 10-minute break.\n\nSo, each cycle takes 1 hour + 10 minutes = 70 minutes.\n\nNow, in an 8-hour shift, there are 8 hours of potential production, but interrupted by breaks.\n\nBut actually, the production is happening in cycles of 70 minutes (60 minutes production + 10 minutes break).\n\nSo, to find out how many complete cycles there are in an 8-hour shift, I need to divide the total shift time by the cycle time.\n\nFirst, convert the 8-hour shift into minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\n\nNow, divide the total shift time by the cycle time: 480 minutes / 70 minutes/cycle.\n\n480 / 70 = 6.857 cycles.\n\nSo, there are 6 complete cycles in the shift, with some time left over.\n\nEach complete cycle consists of 1 hour of production and a 10-minute break.\n\nSo, in 6 cycles, there are 6 hours of production and 6 * 10 = 60 minutes of breaks.\n\nNow, the remaining time after 6 cycles is 480 - (6 * 70) = 480 - 420 = 60 minutes.\n\nIn this remaining 60 minutes, they can have another hour of production, followed by a 10-minute break, but only if the shift allows it.\n\nWait, but the shift is only 480 minutes (8 hours), and 6 cycles take 420 minutes, leaving 60 minutes.\n\nIf they use the last 60 minutes for production, then they would produce for an additional hour, but without a following break, since the shift is ending.\n\nSo, total production time is 6 hours from the complete cycles plus 1 additional hour at the end, totaling 7 hours of production.\n\nTherefore, the total widgets produced are 7 hours * 150 widgets/hour = 1050 widgets.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there might be 8 cycles, but that doesn't seem right because 8 cycles would be 8 * 70 = 560 minutes, which is more than the 480-minute shift.\n\nSo, my initial calculation of 6 complete cycles plus 1 additional hour of production seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the number of production hours and the breaks separately.\n\nTotal shift time: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\n\nEach production hour is followed by a 10-minute break.\n\nSo, for every 60 minutes of production, there are 10 minutes of break.\n\nTherefore, for each hour of production, the total time required is 70 minutes.\n\nNow, how many such 70-minute periods are there in 480 minutes?\n\n480 / 70 = 6.857.\n\nSo, there are 6 full cycles of 70 minutes each, which account for 6 * 70 = 420 minutes.\n\nThe remaining time is 480 - 420 = 60 minutes.\n\nIn these remaining 60 minutes, they can have one more hour of production without a following break.\n\nTherefore, total production time is 6 hours from the cycles plus 1 hour from the remaining time, totaling 7 hours.\n\nThus, total widgets produced are 7 * 150 = 1050 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the break after the last production hour might not be taken if the shift ends.\n\nBut according to the problem, \"after each hour, they take a break and production stops for 10 minutes.\"\n\nSo, after each hour of production, there is a 10-minute break.\n\nBut in the last hour, if the shift ends, they might not take the break.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll stick with the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 1050 widgets in an 8-hour shift.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1050} \\]"
