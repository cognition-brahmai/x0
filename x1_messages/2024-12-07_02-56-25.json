        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a cube-shaped room with each side measuring 4 meters. The ant is at one corner and needs to walk to the diagonally opposite corner, but it can only walk along the walls. We need to find the shortest path for the ant to travel.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the cube. Let's label the corners for clarity. Let's say the ant starts at corner A, and the diagonally opposite corner is corner G. The cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom.\n\nPotential Path 1: Ant goes from A to B (along the bottom face), then from B to C (along the right face), and finally from C to G (along the top face). So, it's a three-segment path.\n\nPotential Path 2: Ant goes from A to D (along the front face), then from D to E (along the top face), and finally from E to G (along the back face). Another three-segment path.\n\nPotential Path 3: Ant goes from A to B (bottom face), then from B to F (back face), and finally from F to G (top face). Yet another three-segment path.\n\nPotential Path 4: Ant goes from A to D (front face), then from D to H (left face), and finally from H to G (top face). One more three-segment path.\n\nWait, are there any two-segment paths? Let's see.\n\nPotential Path 5: Ant goes from A to C (bottom face diagonal), then from C to G (top face). But I'm not sure if moving along the diagonal of the bottom face is allowed since the ant can only walk along the walls, not across diagonals unless they are edges.\n\nHmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are paths where the ant walks along two faces without going through a corner.\n\nWait, maybe we can unfold the cube to find the shortest path.\n\nUnfolding the cube is a good idea. By unfolding the cube, we can represent the three-dimensional problem in two dimensions, which might make it easier to calculate the distance.\n\nLet's try unfolding the cube in such a way that the path from A to G is a straight line.\n\nOne way to unfold the cube is to unfold it such that the bottom face and the front face are adjacent. So, if we unfold the cube like that, the path from A to G would be a straight line across these two faces.\n\nIn this case, the distance would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 4 meters and 8 meters (since the ant travels along two faces, each 4 meters).\n\nSo, distance = sqrt(4^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(16 + 64) = sqrt(80) = approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nIs there a better unfolding?\n\nAnother way to unfold the cube is to unfold the bottom face and the right face adjacent to each other. Then, the path from A to G would be a straight line across these two faces.\n\nAgain, the legs of the right triangle would be 4 meters and 8 meters, so the distance is the same as above, approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way to unfold the cube that gives a shorter path.\n\nLet's try unfolding the cube such that the bottom face, the front face, and the top face are all in a straight line.\n\nIn this case, the path from A to G would be a straight line across three faces: bottom, front, and top.\n\nThe legs of the right triangle would be 4 meters and 12 meters (since three faces are unfolded in a line).\n\nThen, distance = sqrt(4^2 + 12^2) = sqrt(16 + 144) = sqrt(160) = approximately 12.65 meters.\n\nThat's longer than the previous paths, so it's not better.\n\nIs there another way to unfold the cube?\n\nWhat if we unfold the bottom face and the back face adjacent to each other, and then the top face adjacent to the back face.\n\nIn this case, the path from A to G would be a straight line across the bottom face and the back face.\n\nThe legs of the right triangle would be 8 meters and 4 meters, same as before, so distance is approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to unfold the cube where the path is shorter.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe if the ant walks along the left face or the right face in a different sequence, we can get a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a path where the ant walks along the bottom face and the top face directly.\n\nBut since the ant can only walk along the walls, it can't walk directly from the bottom face to the top face without going through a side face.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the net of the cube more carefully.\n\nThere are 11 possible nets of a cube, but we don't need to consider all of them. We just need to find an unfolding where the starting point and the ending point are in a position where the straight-line distance is minimized.\n\nIn the earlier unfoldings, we had legs of 4 meters and 8 meters, giving a distance of approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nIs there a way to get smaller legs?\n\nWait, what if we unfold the cube such that the path from A to G goes across the bottom face, the right face, and the top face, but in a different configuration where the total distance is shorter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to unfold the cube where the path is a straight line with legs of 4*sqrt(2) and something else.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure that the unfolding is valid, meaning that the faces are connected appropriately.\n\nMaybe I should try to calculate the distance for different possible unfoldings and see which one gives the shortest path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula for this.\n\nI recall that in a cube, the shortest path along the surface between two diagonally opposite corners is equal to the square root of 3 times the side length.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let's check.\n\nIf the side length is 4 meters, then sqrt(3)*4 is approximately 1.732*4=6.928 meters.\n\nBut in our earlier calculations, we got approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I misremembered the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is for the space diagonal, which is sqrt(3)*side, but in this case, the ant is moving along the surface, not through the interior.\n\nSo, the space diagonal isn't relevant here.\n\nBack to the unfolding approach.\n\nLet's consider unfolding the cube such that the bottom face and the front face are adjacent, and the front face and the top face are adjacent.\n\nThen, the path from A to G is a straight line across these three faces.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated it as sqrt(4^2 + 8^2)=sqrt(80)=approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nIs there a way to get a shorter path?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ant's path as moving along two faces only, without going through three faces.\n\nWait, but in a cube, to go from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner, the ant has to cross at least two faces.\n\nLet me confirm that.\n\nFrom corner A on the bottom face to corner G on the top face, the ant must cross either the front and right faces, or front and back faces, etc.\n\nSo, it's at least two faces.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the shortest path is along two faces.\n\nIn that case, the distance would be the sum of the lengths of the two faces.\n\nWait, but that wouldn't be a straight line.\n\nWait, no. If we unfold the cube, the path is a straight line in the unfolded net.\n\nSo, if we unfold two faces adjacent to each other, the path from A to G would be a straight line across these two faces.\n\nWhat would be the legs of the right triangle in this case?\n\nIf we unfold the bottom face and the front face adjacent to each other, then the path from A to G would be a straight line with legs of 4 meters and 4 meters.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in this configuration, the two points might not be diagonally opposite.\n\nLet me draw this out.\n\nImagine the bottom face is a square, with A at one corner.\n\nUnfold the front face adjacent to the bottom face.\n\nSo, now we have two squares side by side.\n\nPoint A is at one corner, and point G would be at the opposite corner of the top face, which isn't directly represented in this unfolding.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to unfold the top face adjacent to the front face.\n\nSo, bottom face adjacent to front face, front face adjacent to top face.\n\nNow, the path from A to G is a straight line across these three faces.\n\nBut earlier, this gave us sqrt(4^2 + 8^2)=approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nIs there a way to unfold the cube such that the path is across two faces only?\n\nLet's try unfolding the bottom face and the right face adjacent to each other.\n\nThen, the path from A to G would be a straight line across these two faces.\n\nIn this case, the legs of the right triangle would be 4 meters and 8 meters, same as before.\n\nWait, but that's the same as earlier, approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nIs there a different way to unfold the cube to get shorter legs?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if the ant takes a path that crosses three faces, but in a different configuration.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the ant can walk along three faces, but in a way that the legs of the right triangle are smaller.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more optimal path that isn't immediately obvious.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think in terms of flattening the cube into a net and finding the straight-line distance between A and G in different nets.\n\nLet's consider different nets of the cube.\n\nFirst net: cross shape with the center being the front face, surrounded by the top, bottom, left, and right faces.\n\nIn this net, point A is on the bottom face, and point G is on the top face.\n\nThe straight-line distance between A and G would be across the front face, which is 4 meters horizontally and 4 meters vertically, so sqrt(4^2 + 4^2)=sqrt(32)=approximately 5.66 meters.\n\nWait, that seems shorter than previous calculations.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nWait, but in this net, the top and bottom faces are adjacent through the front face.\n\nSo, the path from A to G is a straight line across the bottom face, front face, and top face, but in this net, it's represented as a straight line across the front face.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misrepresenting the net.\n\nLet me try to visualize this again.\n\nIf I unfold the cube such that the bottom face is adjacent to the front face, and the front face is adjacent to the top face, then points A and G would be positioned such that the straight-line distance is sqrt(4^2 + 4^2)=sqrt(32)=approximately 5.66 meters.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered unfolding the cube differently, I got sqrt(4^2 + 8^2)=approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nSo, this seems better.\n\nIs this the shortest possible path?\n\nWait, maybe there's an even shorter path in another net.\n\nLet's try another net.\n\nSecond net: a zigzag of three faces in one direction and three in another.\n\nFor example, bottom, left, back in one row, and front, right, top in another row.\n\nIn this net, the distance from A to G might be different.\n\nIn this configuration, point A is on the bottom face, and point G is on the top face.\n\nThe straight-line distance would depend on how the net is arranged.\n\nIt's getting a bit complicated to visualize.\n\nPerhaps the first net I considered gives the shortest path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mathematical way to confirm the shortest path.\n\nI recall that in a cube, the shortest path along the surface between two diagonally opposite corners is equal to the square root of 2 times the side length, multiplied by something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of unfolding the cube into a plane and calculating the Euclidean distance between the start and end points.\n\nIn the first net I considered, with the bottom, front, and top faces unfolded in a line, the straight-line distance was sqrt(4^2 + 4^2)=sqrt(32)=approximately 5.66 meters.\n\nIn another net, with bottom and front faces adjacent, and front and right faces adjacent, the straight-line distance was sqrt(4^2 + 8^2)=sqrt(80)=approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nSo, the first net gives a shorter path.\n\nIs there a net where the straight-line distance is shorter than sqrt(32)?\n\nLet's consider another net.\n\nThird net: bottom, right, back in a row, and top, front, left in another row.\n\nIn this net, the straight-line distance from A to G might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps in this net, the distance is sqrt(8^2 + 4^2)=sqrt(80)=approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nSo, longer than the first net.\n\nTherefore, the first net gives the shortest path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a net where the straight-line distance is sqrt(4^2 + 4^2)=approximately 5.66 meters.\n\nWait, but is that actually possible?\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nIn the cross-shaped net, with the front face in the center, surrounded by top, bottom, left, and right faces, points A and G would be positioned such that the straight-line distance is indeed sqrt(4^2 + 4^2)=sqrt(32)=approximately 5.66 meters.\n\nBut is this the actual shortest path?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to verify this calculation.\n\nLet me try to calculate it differently.\n\nIf I unfold the bottom face and the front face adjacent to each other, and then the front face and the top face adjacent to each other, in a way that points A and G are positioned horizontally or vertically apart by 4 meters each.\n\nThen, the straight-line distance is sqrt(4^2 + 4^2)=sqrt(32)=approximately 5.66 meters.\n\nBut earlier, I thought of another unfolding where the legs are 4 meters and 8 meters, giving approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nSo, the first unfolding seems better.\n\nIs there a way to get legs that are smaller than 4 and 4?\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the ant can walk along different sequences of faces to get a shorter path.\n\nWait, but in this unfolding, it seems that sqrt(32) is the shortest possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to arrange the net such that the straight-line distance is shorter.\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is approximately 5.66 meters.\n\nBut to be precise, it's 4*sqrt(2) meters.\n\nBut let's confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the shortest path between two diagonally opposite corners of a cube, walking along the surface.\n\nI recall that the formula is sqrt(2*a^2 + a^2) = a*sqrt(3), but that's for the space diagonal, which isn't applicable here.\n\nWait, no, the space diagonal is from one corner to the opposite corner through the interior of the cube, which is indeed a*sqrt(3).\n\nBut here, the ant is walking along the surface, so it's a different problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is sqrt((2a)^2 + a^2) = a*sqrt(5), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider that in the unfolded net, the path is a straight line between A and G.\n\nThe key is to find the unfolding where this straight line is the shortest.\n\nIn the cross-shaped net, the distance is sqrt(32)=4*sqrt(2).\n\nIn other nets, the distance is sqrt(80)=approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is 4*sqrt(2) meters, which is approximately 5.66 meters.\n\nBut wait, is this correct?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf the cube has side length a=4 meters, then in the cross-shaped net, the straight-line distance between A and G is sqrt(a^2 + a^2)=a*sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, distance = 4*sqrt(2) meters.\n\nIn other nets, the distance is sqrt(a^2 + (2a)^2)=sqrt(a^2 + 4a^2)=sqrt(5a^2)=a*sqrt(5), which is approximately 8.94 meters.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is indeed 4*sqrt(2) meters, which is approximately 5.66 meters.\n\nSo, the ant should choose the path that corresponds to the cross-shaped net, where it walks along the bottom face and the front face, in a straight line, which, when unfolded, is a straight line with legs of 4 meters each.\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance the ant can travel is 4*sqrt(2) meters, which is approximately 5.66 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4\\sqrt{2} \\text{ meters}} \\]"
