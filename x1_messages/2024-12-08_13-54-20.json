        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about a square garden and a circular pond. The garden is 10 feet by 10 feet, and the gardener wants to build a circular pond inside it that touches all four sides of the square. I need to find out what the diameter of the pond is.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this scenario. I have a square, and inside it, there's a circle that touches all four sides of the square. So, the circle is inscribed within the square.\n\nIn geometry, when a circle is inscribed in a square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the sides of the square. That seems straightforward.\n\nGiven that the square has sides of 10 feet, the diameter of the circle should also be 10 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the circle touches all four sides of the square, that means that the circle is touching the square at exactly one point on each side. So, the circle is tangent to each side of the square.\n\nIn such a case, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the length of the sides of the square.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the diameter of the pond is 10 feet.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe the circle isn't inscribed in the usual way. Perhaps it's something else.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the circle is circumscribed around the square, meaning that the square touches the circle at its corners.\n\nBut in this case, the problem says the circle touches all four sides of the square, which suggests that it's inscribed within the square, touching the sides at their midpoints.\n\nSo, in that case, the diameter would indeed be equal to the side length of the square.\n\nAlternatively, if the circle was circumscribed around the square, the diameter would be equal to the diagonal of the square.\n\nBut that's not the case here, as the problem specifies that the circle touches all four sides of the square.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the pond is equal to the side length of the square, which is 10 feet.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]\n"
