        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing merge sort in Python:\n\n1. **Understand the Algorithm**:\n   - Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).\n   - Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.\n\n2. **Implement the Merge Function**:\n   - This function merges two sorted lists into one sorted list.\n\n3. **Implement the Merge Sort Function**:\n   - This function recursively divides the list into halves and merges them using the merge function.\n\n4. **Take User Input**:\n   - Read a list of integers from the user.\n\n5. **Sort the List**:\n   - Use the merge sort function to sort the list.\n\n6. **Display the Sorted List**:\n   - Print the sorted list.\n\nHere's the complete Python code for merge sort:\n\n```python\ndef merge(left, right):\n    result = []\n    i = j = 0\n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i] < right[j]:\n            result.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n    result.extend(left[i:])\n    result.extend(right[j:])\n    return result\n\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n    right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    user_input = input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: \")\n    unsorted_list = list(map(int, user_input.split()))\n    sorted_list = merge_sort(unsorted_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Merge Function**:\n   - It takes two sorted lists, `left` and `right`, and merges them into a single sorted list.\n   - It uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse the `left` and `right` lists, respectively.\n   - Compares elements from both lists and appends the smaller one to the result list.\n   - After exhausting elements from one list, it appends the remaining elements from the other list.\n\n2. **Merge Sort Function**:\n   - If the list has one or zero elements, it's already sorted, so it returns the list.\n   - Otherwise, it divides the list into two halves and recursively sorts each half.\n   - Finally, it merges the two sorted halves using the `merge` function.\n\n3. **Main Section**:\n   - Reads a list of integers from the user.\n   - Calls the `merge_sort` function to sort the list.\n   - Prints the sorted list.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the list is sorted efficiently using the merge sort algorithm."
