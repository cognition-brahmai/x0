        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 10 feet and a height of 15 feet, and I need to find out the maximum volume of water it can hold, measured in gallons. The problem also gives me a conversion factor: 1 cubic foot equals 7.48 gallons.\n\nFirst, I need to find the volume of the cylinder in cubic feet and then convert that volume to gallons. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nThe diameter of the tank is 10 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is 5 feet. The height is 15 feet.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nV = \u03c0*(5)^2*(15)\n\nV = \u03c0*25*15\n\nV = \u03c0*375\n\nNow, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so:\n\nV \u2248 3.1416 * 375\n\nV \u2248 1178.097 cubic feet\n\nNow, to convert cubic feet to gallons, I use the conversion factor:\n\n1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons\n\nSo, the volume in gallons is:\n\nVolume in gallons = 1178.097 * 7.48\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1178.097 * 7.48 \u2248 8812.25 gallons\n\nSo, the maximum volume of water the tank can hold is approximately 8812.25 gallons.\n\nBut, I should check if I've done everything correctly. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, the formula for the volume of a cylinder is indeed V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nThe diameter is 10 feet, so radius r = 5 feet.\n\nHeight h = 15 feet.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0*(5)^2*(15) = \u03c0*25*15 = \u03c0*375.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, V \u2248 3.1416*375 = 1178.097 cubic feet.\n\nThen, converting to gallons: 1178.097 * 7.48 \u2248 8812.25 gallons.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a more precise value of \u03c0, but for practical purposes, 3.1416 is sufficient.\n\nAlso, the conversion factor is given as 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons, so I'll stick with that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 8812.25 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8812.25} \\]"
