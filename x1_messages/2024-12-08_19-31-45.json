        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a PowerShell script that gathers some key information about the current operating system and then both displays it in the console and saves it to a text file. Sounds straightforward, right? Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to collect the OS name, version, architecture, and the last boot-up time. PowerShell has some built-in cmdlets and properties that can help us get this information easily.\n\n1. **OS Name**: We can get this from the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet or from the `$env:OS` environment variable, but using `Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem` will give us more detailed information.\n\n2. **Version**: Again, from the `Win32_OperatingSystem` class, we can get the version number.\n\n3. **Architecture**: This tells us whether the OS is 32-bit or 64-bit. We can get this from the `Win32_OperatingSystem` class as well.\n\n4. **Last Boot-Up Time**: This is also available in the `Win32_OperatingSystem` class.\n\nOnce we have this information, we'll display it in the console and then write it to a text file.\n\nLet me start by opening PowerShell and creating a new script file. I'll name it `OSInfo.ps1`.\n\nFirst, I need to retrieve the OS information. I'll use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet with the `Win32_OperatingSystem` class.\n\n```powershell\n$os = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem\n```\n\nNow, from this `$os` object, I can access various properties:\n\n- `Caption` for the OS name\n\n- `Version` for the version\n\n- `OSArchitecture` for the architecture\n\n- `LastBootUpTime` for the last boot-up time\n\nI should note that `LastBootUpTime` is in a CIM datetime format, which is pretty unreadable. I need to convert it to a more human-readable format, like \"MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss\".\n\nSo, I'll store these values in variables:\n\n```powershell\n$osName = $os.Caption\n$osVersion = $os.Version\n$osArchitecture = $os.OSArchitecture\n$lastBootUpTime = $os.ConvertToDateTime($os.LastBootUpTime)\n```\n\nWait, I think `ConvertToDateTime` isn't a method of the `$os` object. Let me check. Actually, I can use .NET's `[Management.ManagementDateTimeConverter]` to convert the CIM datetime.\n\nSo, it should be:\n\n```powershell\n$lastBootUpTime = [Management.ManagementDateTimeConverter]::ToDateTime($os.LastBootUpTime)\n```\n\nThat should convert it to a standard .NET DateTime object, which I can then format as needed.\n\nNow, I'll format the output string that I want to display and save to a file. I'll include each piece of information on a new line.\n\n```powershell\n$output = @\"\nOS Name: $($osName)\nOS Version: $($osVersion)\nOS Architecture: $($osArchitecture)\nLast Boot-Up Time: $($lastBootUpTime.ToString(\"MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss\"))\n\"@\n```\n\nThis uses a here-string in PowerShell to create a multi-line string.\n\nNext, I'll display this output in the console:\n\n```powershell\nWrite-Output $output\n```\n\nAnd then, save it to a text file. Let's say I want to save it to `OSInfo.txt` in the same directory as the script.\n\n```powershell\n$output | Out-File -FilePath .\\OSInfo.txt\n```\n\nThat should do it. But, I should consider if the file already exists and maybe append a timestamp to the filename to avoid overwriting previous logs.\n\nWait, maybe I should include the current date and time in the filename. Something like `OSInfo_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`.\n\nI can get the current date and time using `Get-Date` and format it accordingly.\n\n```powershell\n$timestamp = Get-Date -Format \"yyyyMMdd_HHmmss\"\n$filename = \"OSInfo_$($timestamp).txt\"\n```\n\nThen, update the `Out-File` cmdlet to use this filename:\n\n```powershell\n$output | Out-File -FilePath $filename\n```\n\nThis way, each time the script runs, it will create a new file with a unique timestamp, avoiding overwriting previous files.\n\nAlso, it might be helpful to include the filename in the console output so the user knows where the file was saved.\n\n```powershell\nWrite-Output \"Information saved to: $filename\"\n```\n\nLet me put all these pieces together in the script.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a PowerShell script that retrieves and displays information about the current operating system and saves it to a text file, follow these steps:\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```powershell\n# Retrieve OS information\n$os = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem\n\n# Extract relevant properties\n$osName = $os.Caption\n$osVersion = $os.Version\n$osArchitecture = $os.OSArchitecture\n$lastBootUpTime = [Management.ManagementDateTimeConverter]::ToDateTime($os.LastBootUpTime)\n\n# Format the output\n$output = @\"\nOS Name: $($osName)\nOS Version: $($osVersion)\nOS Architecture: $($osArchitecture)\nLast Boot-Up Time: $($lastBootUpTime.ToString(\"MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss\"))\n\"@\n\n# Display output in console\nWrite-Output $output\n\n# Generate unique filename with timestamp\n$timestamp = Get-Date -Format \"yyyyMMdd_HHmmss\"\n$filename = \"OSInfo_$($timestamp).txt\"\n\n# Save output to file\n$output | Out-File -FilePath $filename\n\n# Display filename in console\nWrite-Output \"Information saved to: $filename\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Retrieve OS Information**:\n   - Use `Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem` to get OS details.\n\n2. **Extract Properties**:\n   - `Caption` for OS name.\n   - `Version` for OS version.\n   - `OSArchitecture` for architecture.\n   - `LastBootUpTime` for last boot time, converted to a readable format using `[Management.ManagementDateTimeConverter]::ToDateTime`.\n\n3. **Format Output**:\n   - Use a here-string to format the output with the extracted information.\n\n4. **Display Output**:\n   - Show the formatted output in the console using `Write-Output`.\n\n5. **Generate Unique Filename**:\n   - Create a unique filename including a timestamp to avoid overwriting previous logs.\n\n6. **Save to File**:\n   - Write the output to a text file using `Out-File`.\n\n7. **Confirm File Save**:\n   - Display the filename where the information was saved."
