        "content": "So I've got this problem here: A factory produces widgets in batches of 100, and the probability that any given widget is defective is 0.02. I need to find out the expected number of defective widgets in each batch. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"expected value\" in probability is like the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. So, in this case, if I were to look at many, many batches of 100 widgets, the expected number of defective ones per batch would be what I'm trying to find.\n\nNow, each widget can be either defective or not defective, right? And the probability of a widget being defective is 0.02, which is 2%. So, for each widget, there's a 2% chance it's defective.\n\nSince the batches are made up of 100 widgets, I can think of this as 100 independent trials, each with a success probability of 0.02, where \"success\" here means the widget is defective. This sounds a lot like a binomial distribution.\n\nIn a binomial distribution, the expected value E(X) is given by n * p, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success on each trial.\n\nSo, in this case, n = 100 and p = 0.02. Therefore, the expected number of defective widgets in each batch should be 100 * 0.02.\n\nLet me calculate that: 100 * 0.02 = 2.\n\nSo, the expected number is 2 defective widgets per batch.\n\nWait a minute, is it really that straightforward? Let me double-check.\n\nI recall that expected value is linear, meaning that E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y), regardless of whether X and Y are independent or not. So, even if the widgets weren't independent, the expected value would still be additive.\n\nBut in this case, since the widgets are probably independent (assuming one widget being defective doesn't affect another's defectiveness), using the binomial distribution seems perfectly fine.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of summing up the expected values for each individual widget.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet X be the total number of defective widgets in a batch. Then, X = X1 + X2 + ... + X100, where Xi is an indicator random variable that is 1 if the ith widget is defective and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe expected value of X is E(X) = E(X1 + X2 + ... + X100) = E(X1) + E(X2) + ... + E(X100), by the linearity of expectation.\n\nNow, each E(Xi) = 1 * P(Xi = 1) + 0 * P(Xi = 0) = P(Xi = 1) = 0.02.\n\nSo, E(X) = 100 * 0.02 = 2.\n\nAgain, I get the same answer. So, it seems solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any dependency between the widgets that I haven't accounted for? The problem doesn't suggest that the defectiveness of one widget affects another, so assuming independence seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, the batch size is 100, which is neither particularly small nor large in the context of binomial distributions, so there shouldn't be any issues with using this approach.\n\nFurthermore, the probability of defect is 0.02, which is not too high or too low, so no problems there either.\n\nAlternatively, if the batch size were very large and the probability of defect very small, with the product n*p remaining constant, we might consider approximating the binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution. But here, with n=100 and p=0.02, n*p=2, which is perfectly manageable within the binomial framework, and there's no particular advantage to using a Poisson approximation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the expected number of defective widgets in each batch is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
