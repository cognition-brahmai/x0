        "content": "Let's see. The factory originally produces 1000 widgets per hour. They decide to increase production by 50%. So, first I need to calculate what 50% of 1000 is.\n\n50% of 1000 is 0.5 times 1000, which is 500. So, they increase production by 500 widgets per hour. Therefore, the new production rate is 1000 plus 500, which is 1500 widgets per hour.\n\nBut after increasing production, they find that 10% of the widgets are defective. So, I need to find out how many widgets are non-defective. If 10% are defective, then 90% are non-defective, right?\n\nSo, 90% of 1500 is what I need to calculate. 90% of 1500 is 0.9 times 1500, which is 1350.\n\nTherefore, after the production increase, they produce 1350 non-defective widgets per hour.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Starting with 1000 widgets, increasing by 50% gets us to 1500. Then, 10% defective means 10% of 1500 are defective, which is 150 widgets. So, non-defective widgets would be 1500 minus 150, which is indeed 1350.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1350} \\]"
