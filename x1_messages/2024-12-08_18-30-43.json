A metaphor is a direct comparison between two unlike things, a simile is a comparison using \"like\" or \"as\", and personification attributes human characteristics to non-human entities. For example, in the sentence \"The sun smiled down on the city\", the sun is personified as a smiling entity. Given this, which of the following sentences uses a simile?\nA. The moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.\nB. Her eyes are as blue as the ocean.\nC. The wind whispered through the trees.\nD. The world is a stage.\nE. None of the above."

        "content": "Let's see here. I have this question about literary devices, specifically similes. I need to identify which of the given sentences uses a simile. First off, I remember that a simile is a comparison between two different things using the words \"like\" or \"as.\" So, I should look for a sentence that compares something using either \"like\" or \"as.\"\n\nOption A: \"The moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.\" Hmm, here the moon is being compared to a galleon, but it's using \"is.\" That sounds more like a metaphor, right? Because a metaphor directly says one thing is another thing without using \"like\" or \"as.\"\n\nOption B: \"Her eyes are as blue as the ocean.\" Okay, this one uses \"as.\" So, it's comparing her eyes to the ocean in terms of color, using \"as.\" That seems like a simile.\n\nOption C: \"The wind whispered through the trees.\" This one seems to be giving the wind a human characteristic, whispering, which is personification.\n\nOption D: \"The world is a stage.\" Again, this sounds like a metaphor. It's saying the world is a stage directly, without using \"like\" or \"as.\"\n\nOption E: \"None of the above.\" Well, maybe, but I think option B is a simile.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The definition of a simile is a comparison using \"like\" or \"as.\" In option B, \"are as blue as,\" it's using \"as... as,\" which is another way to form a simile. So, yes, that's comparing her eyes to the ocean using \"as.\"\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll recall that metaphors state a comparison directly without using \"like\" or \"as,\" while similes use those words to make the comparison more explicit. Personification is giving human traits to non-human things.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- A: Metaphor\n\n- B: Simile\n\n- C: Personification\n\n- D: Metaphor\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Her eyes are as blue as the ocean.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
