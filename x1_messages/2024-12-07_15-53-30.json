        "content": "To calculate the area of a rectangle, I know that the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nGiven that the length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters, I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the formula again with the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 15 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 8 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\nNow, I need to multiply 15 by 8. I remember that multiplying by 8 is the same as multiplying by 10 and then subtracting twice the original number because \\( 8 = 10 - 2 \\). But maybe that's complicating it. Let's just multiply directly.\n\n15 times 8:\n\nI know that 10 times 8 is 80, and 5 times 8 is 40. So, adding those together:\n\n\\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( 15 \\times 8 = 120 \\).\n\nNow, since we're dealing with meters, and area is in square meters, the units will be square meters.\n\nSo, the area is 120 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. I can also think of it as 15 times 10 is 150, and then subtracting 15 times 2 (which is 30), so:\n\n\\[ 150 - 30 = 120 \\]\n\nYes, that confirms it. Another way to think about it is to break it down into smaller parts. For example:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 8 = (10 + 5) \\times 8 = (10 \\times 8) + (5 \\times 8) = 80 + 40 = 120 \\]\n\nOr, using the distributive property:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 8 = 15 \\times (10 - 2) = (15 \\times 10) - (15 \\times 2) = 150 - 30 = 120 \\]\n\nBoth methods give me the same result, which reassures me that 120 is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also consider the units. Since both the length and width are in meters, their product should be in meters squared, which is the correct unit for area.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is 120 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]\n"
