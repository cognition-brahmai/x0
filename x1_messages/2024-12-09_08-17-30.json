        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains moving towards each other on parallel tracks. Train A is going at 40 miles per hour, and Train B is going at 60 miles per hour. They're 200 miles apart right now, and I need to find out how long it will take for them to pass each other.\n\nFirst, I should remember that when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speeds add up. So, the speed at which they're approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds. That means 40 mph plus 60 mph, which is 100 mph. So, together, they're closing the distance between them at 100 miles per hour.\n\nNow, they're 200 miles apart. To find out how long it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time = 200 miles / 100 mph\n\nThat gives me time = 2 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If Train A is going 40 mph and Train B is going 60 mph, and they're moving towards each other, their combined speed should indeed be 100 mph. And if they're 200 miles apart, dividing distance by speed should give me the time to meet.\n\nLet me think about it another way. In one hour, Train A will cover 40 miles, and Train B will cover 60 miles. Together, they'll have covered 100 miles in that hour. So, in two hours, they'll cover 200 miles, which is the distance between them. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the time it takes for each train to cover a certain portion of the distance. But I think the method I used is straightforward and correct.\n\nSo, my final answer is 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
