        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company has 200 employees, and the average salary is $3,500 per month. Additionally, the company spends 10% of its total payroll on employee benefits. I need to find out the total monthly expenditure on salaries and benefits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The total monthly expenditure would be the sum of the salaries and the benefits. So, salaries plus benefits equals total expenditure.\n\nI know that there are 200 employees, each earning an average of $3,500 per month. So, the total salary expenditure should be the number of employees multiplied by the average salary.\n\nTotal salaries = number of employees \u00d7 average salary\n\nSo, total salaries = 200 \u00d7 3,500 = $700,000\n\nNow, the company spends an additional 10% of its total payroll on employee benefits. The total payroll here refers to the total salaries, I think. So, benefits = 10% of total salaries.\n\nBenefits = 0.10 \u00d7 total salaries = 0.10 \u00d7 700,000 = $70,000\n\nTherefore, the total monthly expenditure on salaries and benefits would be the sum of the two:\n\nTotal expenditure = total salaries + benefits = 700,000 + 70,000 = $770,000\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The total payroll is $700,000, and benefits are 10% of that, which is $70,000. Adding them up gives $770,000. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total expenditure is the payroll plus 10% of the payroll, which is equivalent to multiplying the payroll by 1.10.\n\nTotal expenditure = total salaries \u00d7 (1 + 0.10) = 700,000 \u00d7 1.10 = $770,000\n\nThat confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the company's total monthly expenditure on salaries and benefits is $770,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{770000} \\]"
