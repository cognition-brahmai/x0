        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. There's a square room with an area of 64 square meters. There are two doors on opposite walls, each 1 meter wide. I need to find out how long it takes to walk from one door to the other if I walk at a speed of 2 meters per second.\n\nFirst, since the room is square and has an area of 64 square meters, I can find the length of one side of the square. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so side squared equals 64. Taking the square root of both sides, the side length is 8 meters.\n\nNow, there are two doors on opposite walls, each 1 meter wide. Since they're on opposite walls, I think that means they're directly across from each other. So, if the room is a square with sides of 8 meters, and the doors are on opposite walls, the distance between them would be the length of the room, which is 8 meters.\n\nBut wait, the doors are each 1 meter wide, and they're on opposite walls. Does that mean the starting point is at the center of one door and the ending point is at the center of the other door?\n\nIf each door is 1 meter wide, and they're centered on their respective walls, then the centers of the doors would be 0.5 meters from the edges of the doors.\n\nWait, no. If the doors are 1 meter wide, and they're on opposite walls, then the centers of the doors would be 0.5 meters from the edges of the walls, assuming the doors are centered on the walls.\n\nBut actually, the problem doesn't specify where exactly the doors are placed on the walls, only that they're on opposite walls and each is 1 meter wide. For simplicity, I'll assume that the doors are centered on their respective walls.\n\nSo, if the room is 8 meters on each side, and the doors are on opposite walls, centered, then the distance between the centers of the two doors would be the length of the room, which is 8 meters.\n\nNow, I need to walk from one door to the other at a speed of 2 meters per second. The time it takes to walk a certain distance is given by distance divided by speed.\n\nSo, time = distance / speed = 8 meters / 2 meters per second = 4 seconds.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider the positions more carefully. If the doors are on opposite walls, but not necessarily directly opposite each other, does that change anything?\n\nHmm. The problem says \"doors on opposite walls,\" which typically means they are directly opposite each other in a square room. But to be thorough, maybe I should consider that the doors could be offset, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I'll assume they're directly opposite each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the doors are on adjacent walls? But the problem says \"opposite walls,\" so that should mean they're on walls that are directly opposite each other.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to visualize the square room. Let's label the walls: north, south, east, west. If one door is on the north wall, the opposite wall would be the south wall. Similarly, east and west are opposites.\n\nSo, if one door is on the north wall and the other on the south wall, and both are centered, then the distance between them is indeed the length of the room, which is 8 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if the doors are on east and west walls, the distance between them would still be the length of the room, which is again 8 meters.\n\nWait a minute, in a square room, all sides are equal, so it doesn't matter which pair of opposite walls the doors are on; the distance between them should be the same, 8 meters.\n\nTherefore, the distance to walk from one door to the other is 8 meters, and at a speed of 2 meters per second, the time taken would be 4 seconds.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other factor to consider. The width of the doors is given as 1 meter each, but since we're walking from one door to the other, and assuming we're walking from the center of one door to the center of the other, the width of the doors shouldn't affect the distance between them.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the doors are not centered on the walls, but the problem states that they are on opposite walls, each 1 meter wide. But without specifying their positions on the walls, I think it's safe to assume they're centered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the doors are not centered, and their positions affect the distance. Let's explore that.\n\nSuppose the doors are placed at different positions on their respective walls. For example, one door is placed at the corner of one wall, and the other door is placed at the corner of the opposite wall.\n\nIn that case, the distance between the doors would be different.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"doors on opposite walls, each 1 meter wide.\" It doesn't specify their positions on the walls, but it's probably safe to assume they are centered unless otherwise stated.\n\nMoreover, in practical terms, doors are usually centered on walls or placed in standard positions, so assuming they are centered seems reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the centers of the two doors is equal to the side length of the square room, which is 8 meters.\n\nThus, the time to walk from one door to the other at 2 meters per second is 8 meters divided by 2 meters per second, which equals 4 seconds.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
