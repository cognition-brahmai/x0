        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about finding out how many students in a class don't play any of the three sports: soccer, basketball, or volleyball. We have a total of 30 students, and we're given the numbers for each sport and their overlaps.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Total students, \\( n = 30 \\)\n\n- Students who play soccer, \\( |S| = 12 \\)\n\n- Students who play basketball, \\( |B| = 14 \\)\n\n- Students who play volleyball, \\( |V| = 16 \\)\n\n- Students who play both soccer and basketball, \\( |S \\cap B| = 5 \\)\n\n- Students who play both soccer and volleyball, \\( |S \\cap V| = 6 \\)\n\n- Students who play both basketball and volleyball, \\( |B \\cap V| = 7 \\)\n\n- Students who play all three sports, \\( |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 3 \\)\n\nWe need to find the number of students who don't play any of these sports. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who play at least one sport and then subtract that from the total number of students.\n\nThe formula for the number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\n\\[\n|S \\cup B \\cup V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap V| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V|\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n\\[\n|S \\cup B \\cup V| = 12 + 14 + 16 - 5 - 6 - 7 + 3\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that step by step:\n\nFirst, add the individual sport players:\n\n\\[\n12 + 14 = 26\n\\]\n\n\\[\n26 + 16 = 42\n\\]\n\nNext, subtract the students who play two sports:\n\n\\[\n42 - 5 = 37\n\\]\n\n\\[\n37 - 6 = 31\n\\]\n\n\\[\n31 - 7 = 24\n\\]\n\nFinally, add back the students who play all three sports:\n\n\\[\n24 + 3 = 27\n\\]\n\nSo, 27 students play at least one sport. To find the number of students who don't play any sport, we subtract this number from the total number of students:\n\n\\[\nn - |S \\cup B \\cup V| = 30 - 27 = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 3 students don't play any of these sports.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again with the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n\\[\n|S \\cup B \\cup V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap V| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V|\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n|S \\cup B \\cup V| = 12 + 14 + 16 - 5 - 6 - 7 + 3\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\[\n12 + 14 = 26\n\\]\n\n\\[\n26 + 16 = 42\n\\]\n\n\\[\n42 - 5 = 37\n\\]\n\n\\[\n37 - 6 = 31\n\\]\n\n\\[\n31 - 7 = 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\n24 + 3 = 27\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 27 students play at least one sport. Subtracting from the total:\n\n\\[\n30 - 27 = 3\n\\]\n\nHmm, it seems consistent. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the students who play exactly one sport, exactly two sports, and all three sports.\n\nFirst, students who play exactly two sports:\n\n- Soccer and basketball but not volleyball: \\( |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 5 - 3 = 2 \\)\n\n- Soccer and volleyball but not basketball: \\( |S \\cap V| - |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 6 - 3 = 3 \\)\n\n- Basketball and volleyball but not soccer: \\( |B \\cap V| - |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 7 - 3 = 4 \\)\n\nNow, students who play only one sport:\n\n- Only soccer: \\( |S| - |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 12 - 5 - 6 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n- Only basketball: \\( |B| - |S \\cap B| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 14 - 5 - 7 + 3 = 5 \\)\n\n- Only volleyball: \\( |V| - |S \\cap V| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 16 - 6 - 7 + 3 = 6 \\)\n\nNow, let's add up all these:\n\n- Only soccer: 4\n\n- Only basketball: 5\n\n- Only volleyball: 6\n\n- Exactly two sports: 2 (soccer and basketball) + 3 (soccer and volleyball) + 4 (basketball and volleyball) = 9\n\n- All three sports: 3\n\nTotal students who play at least one sport:\n\n\\[\n4 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nWait, this doesn't match the previous total of 27. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nHold on, I think I misapplied the formula for students who play only one sport. Let me correct that.\n\nThe formula for students who play only one sport should be:\n\n- Only soccer: \\( |S| - |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 12 - 5 - 6 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n- Only basketball: \\( |B| - |S \\cap B| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 14 - 5 - 7 + 3 = 5 \\)\n\n- Only volleyball: \\( |V| - |S \\cap V| - |B \\cap V| + |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 16 - 6 - 7 + 3 = 6 \\)\n\nStudents who play exactly two sports:\n\n- Soccer and basketball but not volleyball: \\( |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 5 - 3 = 2 \\)\n\n- Soccer and volleyball but not basketball: \\( |S \\cap V| - |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 6 - 3 = 3 \\)\n\n- Basketball and volleyball but not soccer: \\( |B \\cap V| - |S \\cap B \\cap V| = 7 - 3 = 4 \\)\n\nStudents who play all three sports: 3\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nOnly soccer: 4\n\nOnly basketball: 5\n\nOnly volleyball: 6\n\nExactly two sports: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9\n\nAll three sports: 3\n\nTotal: 4 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 3 = 27\n\nYes, that matches the previous total. So, 27 students play at least one sport.\n\nSubtracting from the total number of students:\n\n30 - 27 = 3\n\nTherefore, 3 students don't play any of these sports.\n\nI think this is correct now. The discrepancy earlier was due to an addition error in the alternative approach. But now both methods confirm that 3 students don't play any sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
