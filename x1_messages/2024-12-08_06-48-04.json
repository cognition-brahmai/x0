        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Golang program that reads a big text file, counts how many times each word appears, and then saves those counts in something called a Redis key-value store. I'm not super familiar with Redis, but I've heard of it\u2014it's a database that stores data in memory, right? So, first things first, I need to understand what Redis is and how to use it with Go.\n\nI know that Go has packages for interacting with Redis, like \"go-redis\"/redis. I should probably import that package into my program. Before I dive into the code, I need to make sure I have Redis installed and running on my machine. I think I have it installed, but I should check by typing 'redis-server' in the terminal to make sure it starts up without any issues.\n\nOkay, so the program needs to read a large text file. Handling large files can be tricky because you don't want to load the entire file into memory at once, especially since it's big. In Go, I can read the file in chunks or line by line to save memory. I should look into using a scanner from the \"bufio\" package, which can read the file line by line.\n\nOnce I have the file read line by line, I need to split each line into words. In Go, I can use the \"strings\" package to split the line on whitespace or punctuation. I should also consider that words might have punctuation attached, like a period or comma, so I need to handle that by trimming punctuation from the words.\n\nAfter splitting the lines into words, I need to count how many times each word appears. For that, I can use a map where the keys are the words and the values are the counts. Each time I encounter a word, I check if it's already in the map. If it is, I increment its count; if not, I add it to the map with a count of one.\n\nOnce I have all the word counts in the map, I need to store them in Redis. From what I know, Redis can store key-value pairs, and in this case, the keys could be the words and the values could be the counts. Since Redis stores data in memory, it should be fast for lookups and updates.\n\nBut wait, Redis is in-memory, which means if the server restarts, the data could be lost unless it's persisted. I should check how to configure Redis for persistence, especially since this is a key-value store for word counts.\n\nAlso, since the text file is large, I need to make sure that my program is efficient and doesn't take too much time to process. Maybe I can look into ways to optimize the word counting, like using multiple goroutines to process different parts of the file in parallel.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful with concurrency because multiple goroutines accessing the map for counting words could lead to race conditions. To handle that, I could use synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or use a concurrent-safe map.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can collect the word counts in memory first and then batch insert them into Redis to reduce the number of network calls, assuming that Redis is on a separate server.\n\nWait, if Redis is running on the same machine, maybe the network overhead isn't a big issue, but it's still good to minimize the number of operations.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that Redis has different data structures, like hashes, lists, sets, etc. For word counts, using a hash where each field is a word and its value is the count might be efficient. Or, I could use string keys with the word as the key and the count as the value.\n\nI need to decide which data structure to use based on how I plan to access the data later. If I need to retrieve counts for individual words frequently, maybe string keys are sufficient.\n\nBut if I need to retrieve all word counts at once, a hash might be better because I can retrieve all fields at once.\n\nHmm, but for a large number of unique words, a hash might not be the most efficient in terms of memory usage. I should check Redis documentation to see what's the best practice for this scenario.\n\nAlso, I need to think about data types. In Go, the word counts are integers, and in Redis, I can store them as strings or integers. Redis has support for integer data types, so I should make sure to store them appropriately.\n\nNow, about the program structure. I'll need to:\n\n1. Read the text file line by line.\n\n2. Split each line into words.\n\n3. Clean the words (trim punctuation, convert to lowercase, etc.).\n\n4. Count the occurrences of each word using a map.\n\n5. Connect to the Redis server.\n\n6. Store the word counts in Redis.\n\nI should also handle any errors that might occur, like file not found, permission issues, or Redis connection failures.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the code in my mind.\n\nFirst, import the necessary packages:\n\nimport (\n\n \"bufio\"\n\n \"fmt\"\n\n \"os\"\n\n \"strings\"\n\n \"github.com/go-redis/redis/v8\"\n\n \"sync\"\n\n)\n\nThen, define a function to process the file:\n\nfunc main() {\n\n // Open the file\n\n file, err := os.Open(\"large_text_file.txt\")\n\n if err != nil {\n\n fmt.Println(\"Error opening file:\", err)\n\n return\n\n }\n\n defer file.Close()\n\n // Create a scanner to read the file line by line\n\n scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)\n\n // Map to store word counts\n\n wordCounts := make(map[string]int)\n\n var mu sync.Mutex\n\n // Scan each line\n\n for scanner.Scan() {\n\n line := scanner.Text()\n\n // Split line into words\n\n words := strings.Fields(line)\n\n // Process each word\n\n for _, word := range words {\n\n // Clean the word\n\n cleanWord := strings.ToLower(strings.Trim(word, \".,!?:;()-\"))\n\n if cleanWord != \"\" {\n\n mu.Lock()\n\n wordCounts[cleanWord]++\n\n mu.Unlock()\n\n }\n\n }\n\n }\n\n // Check for errors during scanning\n\n if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {\n\n fmt.Println(\"Error reading file:\", err)\n\n return\n\n }\n\n // Connect to Redis\n\n client := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{\n\n Addr: \"localhost:6379\",\n\n Password: \"\", // no password set\n\n DB: 0, // use default DB\n\n })\n\n // Store word counts in Redis\n\n for word, count := range wordCounts {\n\n err := client.Set(ctx, word, count, 0).Err()\n\n if err != nil {\n\n fmt.Println(\"Error setting key:\", err)\n\n }\n\n }\n\n fmt.Println(\"Word counts stored in Redis.\")\n\n}\n\nWait, I need to make sure that Redis operations are properly handled, especially if there are a lot of words. Maybe I should use pipelining to send multiple commands at once to Redis to improve performance.\n\nAlso, I should consider using context for Redis operations to handle timeouts or cancellations.\n\nLet me update the code to include context and pipelining.\n\nFirst, import the context package:\n\nimport (\n\n \"context\"\n\n)\n\nThen, create a context:\n\nctx := context.Background()\n\nAnd use pipelining to set multiple keys at once:\n\npipe := client.Pipeline()\n\nfor word, count := range wordCounts {\n\n pipe.Set(ctx, word, count, 0)\n\n}\n\n_, err := pipe.Exec(ctx)\n\nif err != nil {\n\n fmt.Println(\"Error executing pipeline:\", err)\n\n return\n\n}\n\nThis should be more efficient than setting each key individually.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where Redis is not running or not accessible. Maybe I can add a check to see if the Redis server is up before trying to store the data.\n\nAdditionally, for very large files, I might want to process the file in chunks and update the word counts incrementally to avoid memory issues.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the machine has enough memory to hold all the word counts in memory.\n\nAnother consideration is that words could be case-sensitive, but in most word count scenarios, we treat words in a case-insensitive manner. That's why I'm converting all words to lowercase.\n\nHowever, if there are words with mixed case that should be treated differently, I need to adjust the cleaning process.\n\nAlso, I'm trimming only basic punctuation, but there might be other characters to consider, like apostrophes or hyphens.\n\nFor example, in contractions like \"don't\", should \"don't\" be considered as one word or split into \"don\" and \"t\"?\n\nI think \"don't\" should be considered as one word, so trimming only the necessary punctuation.\n\nMaybe I should use a regular expression to split the text into words more accurately.\n\nGo has a \"regexp\" package that can help with that.\n\nI can define a regex pattern that matches word characters and use it to find all words in the text.\n\nThis might be more accurate than using strings.Fields.\n\nLet me look up the regexp package.\n\nYes, I can compile a regex pattern that matches words and then find all matches in each line.\n\nFor example, I can use the pattern `\\b\\w+\\b` to match words.\n\nBut I need to make sure that it handles apostrophes correctly, like in \"don't\" or \"it's\".\n\nMaybe a better pattern is `\\b\\w+'?\\w*\\b` to handle possessives and contractions.\n\nI should test this pattern to see if it captures the words correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the \"unicode\" package to split on word boundaries based on Unicode standards.\n\nGo has the \"unicode/utf8\" package, but I'm not sure if it has word boundary detection.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the \"text\" package or something similar.\n\nUpon checking, Go's \"strings\" package has the FieldsFunc function, which allows specifying a function to determine word boundaries.\n\nI can use that to split the text into words more accurately.\n\nLet me look into that.\n\nYes, FieldsFunc splits the string using a custom function to determine the separators.\n\nI can define a function that treats certain characters as word separators.\n\nThis might be a better approach than using regex for performance reasons.\n\nGiven that the file is large, I want to minimize overhead in processing each line.\n\nSo, using FieldsFunc with a custom separator function could be efficient.\n\nI'll proceed with that.\n\nNow, about cleaning the words. After splitting into words, I need to:\n\n- Convert to lowercase\n\n- Trim any surrounding punctuation\n\nI need to make sure that words like \"word.\" or \"word,\" are treated as \"word\".\n\nAlso, handle words with apostrophes, like \"don't\" or \"it's\", as single words.\n\nI think trimming only the punctuation marks that are not part of the word itself will suffice.\n\nGo's strings.TrimFunc can be used with a function that defines which characters to trim.\n\nI can define a function that trims only specific punctuation marks from the beginning and end of the word.\n\nLet me think about which punctuation marks to trim.\n\nProbably:\n\n- Periods (.)\n\n- Commas (,)\n\n- Semicolons (;)\n\n- Colons (:)\n\n- Exclamation marks (!)\n\n- Question marks (?)\n\n- Parentheses ( and )\n\n- Dashes (-)\n\nBut not apostrophes ('), as they are part of some words.\n\nSo, in TrimFunc, I'll define a function that returns true for the characters to trim.\n\nWait, no\u2014TrimFunc trims characters from the beginning and end of the string for which the function returns true.\n\nSo, I need a function that returns true for the punctuation marks I want to trim.\n\nHere's an example:\n\ntrimChars := func(r rune) bool {\n\n return strings.ContainsRune(\".,;:!?()-\", r)\n\n}\n\nThen, use strings.TrimFunc(word, trimChars) to remove leading and trailing punctuation.\n\nThat should work.\n\nNow, after trimming, I need to convert the word to lowercase.\n\nThen, I can check if the word is empty, and if not, increment its count in the map.\n\nMoving on to the map for word counts.\n\nI'll use a map with string keys and int values.\n\nTo handle concurrent access from multiple goroutines, I need to protect the map with a mutex.\n\nBut if I decide to process the file in multiple goroutines, I need to make sure that the map is safely accessed.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a sync.Map, which is designed for concurrent access.\n\nBut sync.Map is typically used for cases where there are frequent reads and writes, and in this case, I'm mostly writing to the map.\n\nHowever, since Go's map is not safe for concurrent writes, I need to use a mutex to synchronize access.\n\nAlternatively, I can process the file in a single goroutine to avoid concurrency issues, and since Go's map is safe for concurrent reads if only one goroutine is writing to it.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll use a mutex to guard access to the map.\n\nNow, about processing the file.\n\nI can read the file line by line using a scanner, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut for large files, reading line by line might still consume a lot of memory if the lines are long.\n\nAlternatively, I can read the file in chunks, say, 1MB at a time, and process those chunks.\n\nThis way, I can control the memory usage better.\n\nTo do this, I can use abufio.Reader with a specified buffer size.\n\nThen, read the file in chunks and process each chunk for words.\n\nThis seems like a good approach.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nFirst, open the file:\n\nfile, err := os.Open(\"large_text_file.txt\")\n\nif err != nil {\n\n log.Fatal(err)\n\n}\n\ndefer file.Close()\n\nThen, create abufio.Reader with a buffer size, say, 1MB:\n\nreader := bufio.NewReaderSize(file, 1<<20) // 1MB buffer\n\nThen, read the file in chunks:\n\nfor {\n\n chunk, err := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\n if err != nil && err != io.EOF {\n\n log.Fatal(err)\n\n }\n\n if chunk == \"\" {\n\n break\n\n }\n\n // Process the chunk\n\n}\n\nWait, ReadString('\\n') reads until a newline character, which is similar to reading line by line.\n\nMaybe I should read larger chunks at once.\n\nAlternatively, I can read the file in fixed-size blocks.\n\nBut using ReadString('\\n') is fine, as it's efficient and handles buffering internally.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with reading the file line by line.\n\nIn each line, I'll split it into words using FieldsFunc with a custom separator function.\n\nWait, no\u2014FieldsFunc splits the string into fields based on a function that determines whether a character is a separator.\n\nI need to define a function that returns true for separator characters.\n\nIn this case, separator characters are whitespace and punctuation, except for apostrophes within words.\n\nSo, the separator function should return true for whitespace and punctuation marks like periods, commas, etc., but not for apostrophes.\n\nHere's how I can define the separator function:\n\nfunc isSeparator(r rune) bool {\n\n return !unicode.IsLetter(r) && !unicode.IsNumber(r) && r != '\\''\n\n}\n\nThis function will treat any character that is not a letter, number, or apostrophe as a separator.\n\nThen, use strings.FieldsFunc(line, isSeparator) to split the line into words.\n\nAfter splitting, I'll have a slice of words, which I can then clean and count.\n\nIn the cleaning step, I'll convert each word to lowercase and trim specific punctuation marks using TrimFunc with the trimChars function I defined earlier.\n\nWait, but in the separator function, I'm already excluding non-letter, non-number, and non-apostrophe characters.\n\nSo, in the words obtained from FieldsFunc, the only punctuation should be apostrophes within the words.\n\nTherefore, in the trimming step, I might not need to trim anything, as the separators have already been handled.\n\nBut I should check for leading or trailing punctuation that might still be attached.\n\nFor example, if a word ends with a period or comma, FieldsFunc might still include the punctuation as part of the word.\n\nWait, no\u2014FieldsFunc splits on the separators, so if a word ends with a period, the period would be considered a separator.\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nConsider the string \"word.\".\n\nWith the separator function above, the period is a separator, so \"word.\" should be split into [\"word\", \"\"].\n\nWait, that might not be desirable.\n\nI need to adjust the separator function to handle punctuation attached to words properly.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider punctuation as part of the word if it's attached, and let the trimming handle it.\n\nAlternatively, I can modify the separator function to only consider whitespace as separators, and handle punctuation in the cleaning step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDefine the separator function to only consider whitespace as separators:\n\nfunc isSeparator(r rune) bool {\n\n return unicode.IsSpace(r)\n\n}\n\nThen, use strings.FieldsFunc(line, isSeparator) to split the line into words based on whitespace.\n\nAfter splitting, each \"word\" might have punctuation attached, like \"word.\", \"word!\", etc.\n\nIn the cleaning step, I'll trim specific punctuation marks from the beginning and end of each word using TrimFunc with the trimChars function.\n\nThis way, \"word.\" becomes \"word\", \"word!\" becomes \"word\", and so on.\n\nThis seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Define separator function to split on whitespace only.\n\n- Split each line into words using FieldsFunc with this separator function.\n\n- For each word, trim specific punctuation marks using TrimFunc.\n\n- Convert the cleaned word to lowercase.\n\n- If the cleaned word is not empty, increment its count in the map.\n\nThis should handle most cases correctly.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the trimChars function trims only the specified punctuation marks.\n\nDefine trimChars as:\n\ntrimChars := func(r rune) bool {\n\n switch r {\n\n case '.', ',', ';', ':', '!', '?', '(', ')', '-', '[', ']', '{', '}', '\"', '\\'':\n\n return true\n\n default:\n\n return false\n\n }\n\n}\n\nThis will trim the specified punctuation marks from the beginning and end of the word.\n\nBut wait, I don't want to trim apostrophes ('), as they are part of words like \"don't\" or \"it's\".\n\nSo, I should exclude apostrophes from the trimChars function.\n\nUpdate trimChars to:\n\ntrimChars := func(r rune) bool {\n\n switch r {\n\n case '.', ',', ';', ':', '!', '?', '(', ')', '-', '[', ']', '{', '}', '\"':\n\n return true\n\n default:\n\n return false\n\n }\n\n}\n\nNow, apostrophes will not be trimmed, so words like \"don't\" will remain as \"don't\".\n\nThis is better.\n\nNext, I need to consider that some words might have multiple apostrophes, like \"didn't\" or \"it's\".\n\nAs long as the apostrophes are inside the word, they should be preserved.\n\nAlso, handle words that start or end with apostrophes, like \"'word\" or \"word'\", but in English text, this is rare, and it's unclear how to handle such cases.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that words with leading or trailing apostrophes are exceptions and can be handled by trimming the apostrophes.\n\nBut since I'm not trimming apostrophes in trimChars, words like \"'word'\" will remain as \"'word'\", which might not be desirable.\n\nTo handle this, I can adjust the trimChars function to trim apostrophes only when they appear at the beginning or end of the word.\n\nBut in Go's TrimFunc, it's not straightforward to distinguish between leading and trailing characters.\n\nAn alternative approach is to first trim the word using trimChars to remove specified punctuation, and then remove any leading or trailing apostrophes separately.\n\nWait, no\u2014TrimFunc can handle this.\n\nIf I include apostrophes in trimChars, it will trim them from both ends.\n\nBut I don't want to trim apostrophes from the interior of the word.\n\nWait, in Go's TrimFunc, it removes all leading and trailing characters for which the function returns true.\n\nSo, if I include apostrophes in trimChars, it will remove leading and trailing apostrophes, but not those in the middle of the word.\n\nFor example, \"'word'\" would become \"word\", and \"don't\" would remain \"don't\".\n\nThis seems acceptable.\n\nSo, I'll include apostrophes in trimChars.\n\nUpdate trimChars to:\n\ntrimChars := func(r rune) bool {\n\n switch r {\n\n case '.', ',', ';', ':', '!', '?', '(', ')', '-', '[', ']', '{', '}', '\"', '\\'':\n\n return true\n\n default:\n\n return false\n\n }\n\n}\n\nNow, words with leading or trailing apostrophes will have those apostrophes removed, while apostrophes in the middle of the word will be preserved.\n\nThis should handle most cases correctly.\n\nNext, I need to consider accented characters and other Unicode letters.\n\nSince Go handles strings as UTF-8, I need to make sure that the cleaning and counting processes handle Unicode characters properly.\n\nFor example, words like \"caf\u00e9\" should be treated the same as \"cafe\", depending on the requirements.\n\nIf I want to treat accented characters as distinct from their non-accented counterparts, then no action is needed.\n\nBut if I want to normalize the words by removing accents, I need to use Unicode normalization forms.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that accented characters are distinct and preserve them as is.\n\nIf needed, I can add normalization steps using the \"golang.org/x/text/transform\" and \"golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm\" packages, but that might complicate things.\n\nMoving on, after cleaning the words and counting their occurrences in a map, I need to store the results in Redis.\n\nI need to install the Go Redis library if I haven't already.\n\nI can do this using:\n\ngo get github.com/go-redis/redis/v8\n\nThen, import it in my code:\n\nimport \"github.com/go-redis/redis/v8\"\n\nI need to create a Redis client and connect to the Redis server.\n\nAssuming Redis is running locally on the default port (6379), I can create the client like this:\n\nclient := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{\n\n Addr: \"localhost:6379\",\n\n Password: \"\", // no password set\n\n DB: 0, // use default database\n\n})\n\nTo perform operations, I need to use a context.\n\nI can create a background context:\n\nctx := context.Background()\n\nThen, to set a key-value pair in Redis, I can use the Set command:\n\nerr := client.Set(ctx, word, count, 0).Err()\n\nIf there are many words, it's more efficient to use pipelining to reduce the number of round trips to the server.\n\nI can create a pipeline, add Set commands to it, and then execute them all at once.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\npipe := client.Pipeline()\n\nvar cmds []*redis.Command\n\nfor word, count := range wordCounts {\n\n cmd := pipe.Set(ctx, word, count, 0)\n\n cmds = append(cmds, cmd)\n\n}\n\n_, err := pipe.Exec(ctx)\n\nif err != nil {\n\n log.Fatal(err)\n\n}\n\nThis way, all Set commands are sent in a single request.\n\nHowever, even with pipelining, sending thousands or millions of commands might still be time-consuming.\n\nI should consider batching the commands, for example, processing the wordCounts map in chunks and executing the pipeline in batches.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume that the pipeline approach is sufficient.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that the Redis server can handle the amount of data being stored.\n\nIf the dataset is too large, Redis might run out of memory, especially since it stores data in memory by default.\n\nTo handle this, I might need to configure Redis for persistence, so that data is saved to disk periodically.\n\nI can do this by editing the Redis configuration file (redis.conf) and setting the appropriate directives, such as save directives for RDB persistence or enabling AOF persistence.\n\nBut configuring Redis is beyond the scope of this program; I'll assume that Redis is configured appropriately for the task.\n\nNow, let's think about error handling in the program.\n\nI need to handle errors at several points:\n\n- Opening the file\n\n- Reading from the file\n\n- Connecting to Redis\n\n- Executing Redis commands\n\nFor each of these operations, I should check for errors and handle them gracefully, perhaps by logging the error and exiting the program.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that resources are properly cleaned up, such as closing the file after reading.\n\nIn Go, using defer file.Close() ensures that the file is closed regardless of how the function exits.\n\nSimilarly, for the Redis client, I need to make sure it's closed properly, although in simple programs, it might not be necessary.\n\nNow, to test the program, I need a large text file.\n\nI can use a sample text file, perhaps a book from Project Gutenberg, which provides free e-books.\n\nI can download a large text file and use it as input for the program.\n\nAfter running the program, I can connect to the Redis CLI and check if the word counts are stored correctly.\n\nI can retrieve some word counts to verify their accuracy.\n\nAlso, I can compare the word counts with those obtained from a known word counting tool or script to ensure correctness.\n\nIn terms of performance, since the file is large, I need to make sure that the program runs efficiently and doesn't consume excessive memory or take too much time.\n\nI can monitor the program's memory usage and execution time to see if optimizations are needed.\n\nIf necessary, I can profile the program to identify bottlenecks and optimize those parts.\n\nAlternatively, I can implement multi-threading by processing different parts of the file in parallel, but I need to handle the synchronization of the word counts map carefully.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, I'll stick with a single-threaded approach for now.\n\nIn summary, the steps for the program are:\n\n1. Open the large text file.\n\n2. Read the file line by line using a scanner or a buffer.\n\n3. Split each line into words, considering whitespace as separators.\n\n4. Clean each word by converting to lowercase and trimming specified punctuation marks.\n\n5. Count the occurrences of each word using a map, with synchronization if using multiple goroutines.\n\n6. Connect to the Redis server.\n\n7. Store the word counts in Redis using pipelining for efficiency.\n\n8. Handle any errors and ensure resources are properly closed.\n\nI need to write the code accordingly, making sure to handle edge cases and ensure correctness.\n\nOnce the program is written, I can test it with a sample text file and verify the results in Redis.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo accomplish the task of reading a large text file, counting the occurrences of each word, and storing the results in a Redis key-value store, we will use Go's capabilities along with the `go-redis/redis` package to interact with Redis. Below is the complete solution code with explanations.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\t\"sync\"\n\n\t\"github.com/go-redis/redis/v8\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"sync\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Open the file\n\tfile, err := os.Open(\"large_text_file.txt\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error opening file: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\n\t// Create a scanner to read the file line by line\n\tscanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)\n\n\t// Map to store word counts\n\twordCounts := make(map[string]int)\n\tvar mu sync.Mutex\n\n\t// Scan each line\n\tfor scanner.Scan() {\n\t\tline := scanner.Text()\n\t\t// Split line into words based on whitespace\n\t\twords := strings.Fields(line)\n\t\t// Process each word\n\t\tfor _, word := range words {\n\t\t\t// Clean the word: lowercase and trim punctuation\n\t\t\tcleanWord := strings.ToLower(strings.Trim(word, \".,!?:;()-\\\"\"))\n\t\t\tif cleanWord != \"\" {\n\t\t\t\tmu.Lock()\n\t\t\t\twordCounts[cleanWord]++\n\t\t\t\tmu.Unlock()\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Check for errors during scanning\n\tif err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error reading file: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Connect to Redis\n\tclient := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{\n\t\tAddr:     \"localhost:6379\",\n\t\tPassword: \"\", // no password set\n\t\tDB:       0,  // use default database\n\t})\n\n\t// Create context\n\tctx := context.Background()\n\n\t// Pipeline for setting multiple keys\n\tpipe := client.Pipeline()\n\tvar cmds []*redis.Command\n\tfor word, count := range wordCounts {\n\t\tcmd := pipe.Set(ctx, word, count, 0)\n\t\tcmds = append(cmds, cmd)\n\t}\n\t_, err = pipe.Exec(ctx)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error executing pipeline: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Println(\"Word counts stored in Redis.\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **File Reading**:\n   - Open the large text file using `os.Open`.\n   - Use a `bufio.Scanner` to read the file line by line, which is memory efficient for large files.\n\n2. **Word Processing**:\n   - Split each line into words using `strings.Fields`, which splits on whitespace.\n   - Clean each word by converting to lowercase and trimming specified punctuation marks.\n   - Use a mutex-protected map to count occurrences of each word, ensuring thread safety.\n\n3. **Redis Interaction**:\n   - Connect to the Redis server using `go-redis/redis` client.\n   - Use a pipeline to set keys in Redis for better performance, reducing the number of network round trips.\n   - Execute the pipeline to store all word counts in Redis.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Check for errors in file operations and Redis commands, logging fatal errors to ensure the program handles failures gracefully.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient handling of large files and optimal interaction with Redis, making it suitable for processing substantial amounts of text data."
