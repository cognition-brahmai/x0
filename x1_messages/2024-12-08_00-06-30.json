        "content": "I think I've got a riddle here. Let's see, \"I fly, yet I have no wings. I cry, yet I have no eyes. Darkness follows me. Lower light I never see.\" Hmm, okay, so it's something that can fly without having wings, which makes me think of things like wind or maybe even time, since time passes and can be thought of as flying, I guess. But then it says \"I cry, yet I have no eyes.\" So, if it's crying, maybe it's producing something like tears, but without eyes. Maybe it's referring to rainfall, because rain can be thought of as the sky crying, even though the sky doesn't have eyes. And rain does fall from the sky, so that connects with the flying part too.\n\nWait, but then it says \"darkness follows me.\" If it's rain, does darkness follow rain? Well, sometimes rain comes with clouds, which can make it darker, but that seems a bit of a stretch. Maybe there's a better fit. Another thought: could it be a cloud itself? Clouds can move through the sky, which is like flying without wings. They can produce rain, which is like crying without eyes. And perhaps darkness follows clouds because they block the sun. But then the last part says \"lower light I never see.\" If clouds block the sun, they do cause lower light, so that might fit.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. The phrase \"darkness follows me\" could mean that wherever this thing goes, darkness comes after it. And \"lower light I never see\" might mean that it never experiences dimmer light, perhaps always being in a brighter area. That seems a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me try another approach. What else flies without wings? A stone being thrown could be said to fly, but it doesn't cry or have anything to do with darkness. How about a balloon? A balloon can fly without wings, but it doesn't cry. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's smoke. Smoke rises into the air, which is like flying without wings. It can produce tears if it's thick smoke, causing people's eyes to water, but it doesn't have eyes itself. Darkness could follow smoke if it's dense and obscuring light, and maybe in areas with smoke, light is lowered. That seems plausible.\n\nBut let's think of another option. Could it be a meteor or a shooting star? It flies through the sky without wings, and when it burns up, it can create a trail that might be likened to crying without eyes. Darkness could follow it if it's disappearing into the darkness of space, and \"lower light I never see\" could mean that it doesn't experience dimmer light because it's always moving through the bright sky or the dark space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a flame. A flame can be said to fly or dance without wings. It produces tears in the form of smoke or causing people to cry if it's a distressing fire, but it doesn't have eyes. Darkness could follow extinguished flames, and \"lower light I never see\" might mean that the flame always emits light and doesn't experience lower light levels.\n\nAnother possibility is a shadow. A shadow can move around as if flying, without physical wings. It doesn't have eyes, but it can be said to \"cry\" if it stretches or changes shape in a way that resembles tears. Darkness follows a shadow because it's a absence of light, and \"lower light I never see\" could mean that shadows don't exist in areas of lower light because they require a light source to be present.\n\nWait, but shadows actually do exist in lower light; they just might be less defined. Maybe that doesn't fit perfectly.\n\nLet me consider one more option: a lamp or a light source. It can be moved around, flying without wings, especially if it's hung from something or carried by someone. It doesn't have eyes, but it can \"cry\" by shedding light, which is a form of tears, metaphorically speaking. Darkness follows it in the sense that as it moves, the areas it leaves behind become darker. And \"lower light I never see\" could mean that the light source always emits its own light and doesn't experience lower light levels.\n\nThat seems promising. Maybe it's a lamp or a lantern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's fear. Fear can be said to fly, as in spreading quickly, without physical wings. It can make people cry without having eyes itself. Darkness could represent the gloom that fear brings, and \"lower light I never see\" could mean that fear thrives in situations where there is less light or clarity.\n\nBut that seems a bit abstract. Maybe I should stick to more concrete objects.\n\nWait, another thought: could it be a bird's shadow? A shadow can fly along with a bird without wings. It can \"cry\" if the shadow takes on a teardrop shape at certain times of day. Darkness follows it because it's a shadow, and \"lower light I never see\" could mean that the shadow doesn't exist without light to cast it.\n\nHmm, that's interesting, but perhaps too specific.\n\nLet me try to sum this up. The best fits seem to be smoke, a flame, or a lamp. Smoke rises, produces tears, and can lead to darkness by obscuring light. A flame dances without wings, can cause tears, and is associated with light and darkness. A lamp is moved around, sheds light, and darkness follows it as it moves.\n\nMaybe the answer is a cloud, after all, since clouds can fly without wings, produce rain (crying without eyes), bring darkness when they cover the sun, and in areas where clouds are present, light is often lower.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a person. A person can fly without wings, especially if they are in an aircraft. They can cry without eyes if they are shedding emotional tears. Darkness follows them if they move into shaded areas, and \"lower light I never see\" could mean that they always stay in well-lit areas.\n\nBut that seems a bit of a stretch. I think a natural phenomenon like a cloud or smoke is a better fit.\n\nI'm going to go with smoke as the answer to this riddle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Smoke}} \\]"
