        "content": "So I have this problem here: find the sum of the first 100 terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term, a\u2081, is 5 and the common difference, d, is 7. Okay, I need to recall the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence. I think it's S\u2099 = n/2 * (a\u2081 + a\u2099), where S\u2099 is the sum of the first n terms, a\u2081 is the first term, and a\u2099 is the nth term. But I don't know the 100th term yet. Maybe there's another formula that can help me find a\u2099.\n\nI remember that the nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using a\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n-1)d. So, if I plug in the values, a\u2081\u2080\u2080 = 5 + (100-1)*7 = 5 + 99*7. Let me calculate that: 99 times 7 is 693, plus 5 is 698. So, a\u2081\u2080\u2080 is 698.\n\nNow, going back to the sum formula, S\u2081\u2080\u2080 = 100/2 * (5 + 698) = 50 * 703. What's 50 times 703? Let me see, 50 times 700 is 35,000, and 50 times 3 is 150, so total is 35,150.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to check this? Maybe using the formula S\u2099 = n/2 * [2a\u2081 + (n-1)d]. That might be another way to find the sum without finding a\u2099 separately. Let's try that.\n\nS\u2081\u2080\u2080 = 100/2 * [2*5 + (100-1)*7] = 50 * [10 + 99*7] = 50 * [10 + 693] = 50 * 703 = 35,150. Okay, that matches my previous result. So, the sum of the first 100 terms is 35,150.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can derive this again from scratch. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms. So, again, that's (a\u2081 + a\u2099)/2 * n. I already have a\u2081 = 5, a\u2099 = 698, n = 100, so (5 + 698)/2 * 100 = 703/2 * 100 = 351.5 * 100 = 35,150. Same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the sum as S\u2099 = n*a\u2081 + d*sum from k=1 to n-1 of k. The sum from k=1 to n-1 of k is (n-1)n/2. So, S\u2099 = n*a\u2081 + d*(n-1)n/2.\n\nPlugging in the values: S\u2081\u2080\u2080 = 100*5 + 7*(100-1)*100/2 = 500 + 7*99*50 = 500 + 7*4,950 = 500 + 34,650 = 35,150. Again, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The sum of the first 100 terms of this arithmetic sequence is 35,150.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35150} \\]"
