        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the fruit seller starts with 120 apples.\n\nFirst, he sells 40% of them on Monday. To find out how many that is, I need to calculate 40% of 120.\n\nI know that percentage means per hundred, so 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4.\n\nSo, 0.4 times 120 is:\n\n0.4 \u00d7 120 = 48\n\nSo, he sold 48 apples on Monday.\n\nNow, to find out how many apples are left after Monday, I subtract the apples sold from the total:\n\n120 - 48 = 72\n\nSo, he has 72 apples left after Monday.\n\nNext, on Tuesday, he sells 25% of the remaining apples. So, I need to find 25% of 72.\n\nAgain, 25% is the same as 25/100 or 0.25.\n\nSo, 0.25 times 72 is:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 72 = 18\n\nSo, he sold 18 apples on Tuesday.\n\nFinally, to find out how many apples are left after Tuesday, I subtract the apples sold on Tuesday from the remaining apples after Monday:\n\n72 - 18 = 54\n\nTherefore, the fruit seller has 54 apples left after Tuesday.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\nStart with 120 apples.\n\nSold 40% on Monday: 0.4 \u00d7 120 = 48 sold.\n\nApples left: 120 - 48 = 72.\n\nSold 25% of remaining on Tuesday: 0.25 \u00d7 72 = 18 sold.\n\nApples left: 72 - 18 = 54.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]"
