        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that watches a specific folder for any new files and automatically squishes them down using gzip compression. Also, I need to make it so that people can specify the folder and how much they want to compress the files when they run the script from the command line. Sounds straightforward, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to monitor a directory for new files. In Python, the `os` library is my go-to for file system operations. I can use `os.listdir()` to see what's in the directory, and maybe `os.path.getmtime()` to check when files were last modified. But I need to keep an eye on the folder continuously, so perhaps a loop that checks periodically would do the trick.\n\nWait, but there's a better way. I recall there's a library called `watchdog` that can monitor file system events in real-time. It might be overkill for this simple task, and since the prompt specifies using only `os` and `gzip`, I should stick to those. So, a polling approach with `os` seems acceptable.\n\nNext, compressing files with gzip. The `gzip` module in Python should handle this effortlessly. I can open a file, read its contents, and then write those contents to a new file with gzip compression. I should also make sure to set the compression level based on what the user specifies.\n\nSpeaking of user input, command line arguments are essential here. Python's `sys.argv` can capture these arguments. I need to parse the target directory from the command line and an optional compression level. I should also handle cases where the user doesn't provide the directory or gives invalid compression levels.\n\nLet me think about the script's structure:\n\n1. Import necessary modules: `os` for directory and file operations, `sys` for command line arguments, and `gzip` for compression.\n\n2. Parse command line arguments:\n\n- The first argument after the script name should be the target directory.\n\n- The second argument, if provided, should be the compression level (an integer between 1 and 9).\n\n3. Validate the target directory:\n\n- Check if it exists.\n\n- Check if it's a directory.\n\n4. Set up a polling mechanism to periodically check for new files.\n\n- Maybe use a while loop that sleeps for a certain interval between checks.\n\n5. In each iteration, list the files in the directory and compare with the previous list to find new files.\n\n- Keep track of the files that have already been compressed.\n\n6. For each new file, compress it using gzip with the specified compression level.\n\n- Save the compressed file with a .gz extension.\n\n7. Handle any exceptions that might occur during file operations or compression.\n\nAlright, let's start writing some pseudocode to get a better grasp.\n\nPseudocode:\n\nimport os\n\nimport sys\n\nimport time\n\nimport gzip\n\ndef main():\n\n    # Check and parse command line arguments\n\n    if len(sys.argv) < 2:\n\n        print(\"Usage: python script.py <directory> [<compression_level>]\")\n\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    target_dir = sys.argv[1]\n\n    compression_level = 9  # Default compression level\n\n    if len(sys.argv) >= 3:\n\n        try:\n\n            compression_level = int(sys.argv[2])\n\n            if compression_level < 1 or compression_level > 9:\n\n                raise ValueError\n\n        except ValueError:\n\n            print(\"Compression level must be an integer between 1 and 9.\")\n\n            sys.exit(1)\n\n    # Validate the target directory\n\n    if not os.path.isdir(target_dir):\n\n        print(\"The specified path is not a directory or does not exist.\")\n\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    # Initialize a set to keep track of compressed files\n\n    compressed_files = set()\n\n    while True:\n\n        # List all files in the directory\n\n        current_files = set(os.listdir(target_dir))\n\n        # Find new files that haven't been compressed yet\n\n        new_files = current_files - compressed_files\n\n        for file_name in new_files:\n\n            file_path = os.path.join(target_dir, file_name)\n\n            # Skip directories\n\n            if os.path.isdir(file_path):\n\n                continue\n\n            try:\n\n                # Compress the file\n\n                with open(file_path, 'rb') as f_in:\n\n                    with gzip.open(file_path + '.gz', 'wb', compresslevel=compression_level) as f_out:\n\n                        f_out.writelines(f_in)\n\n                print(f\"Compressed {file_path} to {file_path}.gz\")\n\n                # Add to compressed files set\n\n                compressed_files.add(file_name)\n\n            except Exception as e:\n\n                print(f\"Error compressing {file_path}: {e}\")\n\n        # Sleep for a while before checking again\n\n        time.sleep(5)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nHmm, this looks like a good starting point. But I need to think about a few things:\n\n- Tracking compressed files: Using a set to track compressed files might not be persistent across script runs. If the script is stopped and restarted, it will forget which files have been compressed. Maybe I need a separate file to keep track of compressed files.\n\n- Efficiency: Checking the entire directory every 5 seconds might not be efficient for large directories. I should consider a better way to track new files.\n\n- File modifications: What if a file is being written to when the script tries to compress it? I might need to check if a file is still being modified before compressing it.\n\nLet me address these concerns one by one.\n\nFirst, tracking compressed files persistently. I can create a separate file, say \"compressed_files.txt\", in the target directory to keep track of compressed files. Each time a file is compressed, I can write its name to this file. When the script starts, it can read this file to know which files have already been compressed.\n\nSecond, efficiency. For larger directories, listing all files every time might be slow. I could consider storing the list of files separately and updating it incrementally, but that might complicate things. Given that the script is supposed to be simple, perhaps the initial approach is acceptable.\n\nThird, handling files that are still being written to. This is a bit trickier. One way is to check the file modification time. If the modification time hasn't changed after a certain period, it's likely that the file is no longer being written to. I can implement a simple check by recording the modification time and waiting for a short interval before attempting to compress the file.\n\nLet me adjust the pseudocode accordingly.\n\nUpdated Pseudocode:\n\nimport os\n\nimport sys\n\nimport time\n\nimport gzip\n\ntracking_file = \"compressed_files.txt\"\n\ndef get_compressed_files(tracking_path):\n\n    if os.path.exists(tracking_path):\n\n        with open(tracking_path, 'r') as f:\n\n            return set(f.read().splitlines())\n\n    return set()\n\ndef mark_compressed(tracking_path, file_name):\n\n    with open(tracking_path, 'a') as f:\n\n        f.write(file_name + '\\n')\n\ndef main():\n\n    if len(sys.argv) < 2:\n\n        print(\"Usage: python script.py <directory> [<compression_level>]\")\n\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    target_dir = sys.argv[1]\n\n    compression_level = 9\n\n    if len(sys.argv) >= 3:\n\n        try:\n\n            compression_level = int(sys.argv[2])\n\n            if compression_level < 1 or compression_level > 9:\n\n                raise ValueError\n\n        except ValueError:\n\n            print(\"Compression level must be an integer between 1 and 9.\")\n\n            sys.exit(1)\n\n    if not os.path.isdir(target_dir):\n\n        print(\"The specified path is not a directory or does not exist.\")\n\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    tracking_path = os.path.join(target_dir, tracking_file)\n\n    compressed_files = get_compressed_files(tracking_path)\n\n    while True:\n\n        current_files = set(os.listdir(target_dir))\n\n        new_files = current_files - compressed_files - {tracking_file}\n\n        for file_name in new_files:\n\n            file_path = os.path.join(target_dir, file_name)\n\n            if os.path.isdir(file_path):\n\n                continue\n\n            # Check if the file is still being modified\n\n            initial_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)\n\n            time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second\n\n            final_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)\n\n            if initial_size != final_size:\n\n                print(f\"Skipping {file_path} as it is still being written to.\")\n\n                continue\n\n            try:\n\n                with open(file_path, 'rb') as f_in:\n\n                    with gzip.open(file_path + '.gz', 'wb', compresslevel=compression_level) as f_out:\n\n                        f_out.writelines(f_in)\n\n                print(f\"Compressed {file_path} to {file_path}.gz\")\n\n                compressed_files.add(file_name)\n\n                mark_compressed(tracking_path, file_name)\n\n            except Exception as e:\n\n                print(f\"Error compressing {file_path}: {e}\")\n\n        time.sleep(5)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nThis looks better. I've added a tracking file to keep track of compressed files persistently. I've also added a simple check to see if a file's size changes over a short period to determine if it's still being written to.\n\nBut I need to think about potential issues with this approach.\n\n- If a file is being updated regularly, the script might never compress it because its size keeps changing.\n\n- If a file is being written to very slowly, the script might incorrectly assume it's done and compress it, only to have more data written later.\n\n- The tracking file could become outdated if files are manually compressed or removed outside of the script.\n\nTo handle the first issue, I could implement a more robust check for file modifications, maybe by checking the modification time.\n\nLet me see. I can record the modification time of a file and wait for a certain period until its modification time stops changing. If the modification time remains the same for, say, 2 seconds, I can consider the file ready to be compressed.\n\nI'll need to adjust the code to track the modification times of files and check if they've stopped changing.\n\nThis adds some complexity, but it should make the script more reliable.\n\nUpdated Pseudocode:\n\nimport os\n\nimport sys\n\nimport time\n\nimport gzip\n\ntracking_file = \"compressed_files.txt\"\n\ndef get_compressed_files(tracking_path):\n\n    if os.path.exists(tracking_path):\n\n        with open(tracking_path, 'r') as f:\n\n            return set(f.read().splitlines())\n\n    return set()\n\ndef mark_compressed(tracking_path, file_name):\n\n    with open(tracking_path, 'a') as f:\n\n        f.write(file_name + '\\n')\n\ndef main():\n\n    if len(sys.argv) < 2:\n\n        print(\"Usage: python script.py <directory> [<compression_level>]\")\n\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    target_dir = sys.argv[1]\n\n    compression_level = 9\n\n    if len(sys.argv) >= 3:\n\n        try:\n\n            compression_level = int(sys.argv[2])\n\n            if compression_level < 1 or compression_level > 9:\n\n                raise ValueError\n\n        except ValueError:\n\n            print(\"Compression level must be an integer between 1 and 9.\")\n\n            sys.exit(1)\n\n    if not os.path.isdir(target_dir):\n\n        print(\"The specified path is not a directory or does not exist.\")\n\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    tracking_path = os.path.join(target_dir, tracking_file)\n\n    compressed_files = get_compressed_files(tracking_path)\n\n    file_timestamps = {}\n\n    while True:\n\n        current_files = set(os.listdir(target_dir))\n\n        new_files = current_files - compressed_files - {tracking_file}\n\n        for file_name in new_files:\n\n            file_path = os.path.join(target_dir, file_name)\n\n            if os.path.isdir(file_path):\n\n                continue\n\n            current_time = os.path.getmtime(file_path)\n\n            if file_name not in file_timestamps:\n\n                file_timestamps[file_name] = (current_time, time.time())\n\n            else:\n\n                last_time, check_start = file_timestamps[file_name]\n\n                if current_time == last_time:\n\n                    if time.time() - check_start >= 2:  # Waited 2 seconds with no changes\n\n                        try:\n\n                            with open(file_path, 'rb') as f_in:\n\n                                with gzip.open(file_path + '.gz', 'wb', compresslevel=compression_level) as f_out:\n\n                                    f_out.writelines(f_in)\n\n                            print(f\"Compressed {file_path} to {file_path}.gz\")\n\n                            compressed_files.add(file_name)\n\n                            mark_compressed(tracking_path, file_name)\n\n                            del file_timestamps[file_name]\n\n                        except Exception as e:\n\n                            print(f\"Error compressing {file_path}: {e}\")\n\n                    else:\n\n                        file_timestamps[file_name] = (current_time, check_start)\n\n                else:\n\n                    file_timestamps[file_name] = (current_time, time.time())\n\n        time.sleep(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nOkay, now I'm tracking the modification times of new files.

To make it more robust, I could persist this information as well, maybe in another tracking file. But that might complicate the script too much for now.\n\nI should also think about what happens if a file is deleted or renamed while the script is running.

If a file is renamed, the script might treat it as a new file and try to compress it again. To mitigate this, I could track files based on their full path or inode, but that would complicate things.\n\nGiven the scope of this script, I'll assume that files won't be renamed while the script is running. If renaming does occur, it might lead to duplicate compression, which isn't ideal but might be acceptable for this use case.\n\nAnother consideration is performance. For directories with a large number of files, repeatedly listing all files and checking modification times could be slow. To optimize, I could store the list of files and their timestamps in memory and only query the ones that have changed.\n\nHowever, implementing such optimizations might be beyond the scope of this simple script. I'll proceed with the current approach, keeping in mind that it may not be suitable for very large directories.\n\nLet me think about error handling. What if the script doesn't have permission to read or write files in the target directory? I should catch permission errors and inform the user.\n\nAlso, what if the tracking file itself is deleted or becomes corrupted? I need to make sure that the script can handle such scenarios without crashing.\n\nI should also consider adding logging instead of just printing to the console, especially if the script is intended to run for extended periods.\n\nFor now, I'll stick with print statements for simplicity.\n\nLet me summarize the final steps:\n\n1. Parse command line arguments for the target directory and optional compression level.\n\n2. Validate the target directory.\n\n3. Read the list of already compressed files from the tracking file.\n\n4. Continuously monitor the directory for new files.\n\n5. For each new file, check if it's still being modified by comparing its modification time over a short period.\n\n6. Once a file's modification time stabilizes, compress it using gzip with the specified compression level.\n\n7. Record the compressed file in the tracking file.\n\n8. Periodically remove entries from compressed_files for files that no longer exist.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to implement this in actual Python code, ensuring to handle exceptions and edge cases.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python script that monitors a specified directory for new files and automatically compresses them using the gzip format, follow the steps below. This solution uses the `os` and `gzip` libraries for file system operations and compression, respectively.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Monitoring Directory for New Files:**\n   - Use a loop to periodically check for new files in the specified directory.\n   - Track already compressed files using a local tracking file within the target directory.\n\n2. **Compression:**\n   - Compress new files using gzip with a specified compression level (default is 9).\n   - Record compressed files in a tracking file to avoid re-compression on subsequent runs.\n\n3. **Handling File Modifications:**\n   - Check if a file is still being modified by monitoring its modification time.\n   - Wait until the file's modification time remains unchanged for a short period before compressing it.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport time\nimport gzip\n\ntracking_file = \"compressed_files.txt\"\n\ndef get_compressed_files(tracking_path):\n    if os.path.exists(tracking_path):\n        with open(tracking_path, 'r') as f:\n            return set(f.read().splitlines())\n    return set()\n\ndef mark_compressed(tracking_path, file_name):\n    with open(tracking_path, 'a') as f:\n        f.write(file_name + '\\n')\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) < 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python script.py <directory> [<compression_level>]\")\n\n    target_dir = sys.argv[1]\n    compression_level = 9\n    if len(sys.argv) >= 3:\n        try:\n            compression_level = int(sys.argv[2])\n            if compression_level < 1 or compression_level > 9:\n                raise ValueError\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Compression level must be an integer between 1 and 9.\")\n            sys.exit(1)\n\n    if not os.path.isdir(target_dir):\n        print(\"The specified path is not a directory or does not exist.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    tracking_path = os.path.join(target_dir, tracking_file)\n    compressed_files = get_compressed_files(tracking_path)\n\n    file_timestamps = {}\n    while True:\n        current_files = set(os.listdir(target_dir))\n        for file_name in list(compressed_files):\n            file_path = os.path.join(target_dir, file_name)\n            if not os.path.exists(file_path):\n                compressed_files.remove(file_name)\n                print(f\"Removed {file_name} from compressed files as it no longer exists.\")\n\n        new_files = current_files - compressed_files - {tracking_file}\n        for file_name in new_files:\n            file_path = os.path.join(target_dir, file_name)\n            if os.path.isdir(file_path):\n                continue\n            if not os.path.exists(file_path):\n                continue\n\n            current_time = os.path.getmtime(file_path)\n            if file_name not in file_timestamps:\n                file_timestamps[file_name] = (current_time, time.time())\n            else:\n                last_time, check_start = file_timestamps[file_name]\n                if current_time == last_time:\n                    if time.time() - check_start >= 2:\n                        try:\n                            with open(file_path, 'rb') as f_in:\n                                with gzip.open(file_path + '.gz', 'wb', compresslevel=compression_level) as f_out:\n                                    f_out.writelines(f_in)\n                            print(f\"Compressed {file_path} to {file_path}.gz\")\n                            compressed_files.add(file_name)\n                            mark_compressed(tracking_path, file_name)\n                            del file_timestamps[file_name]\n                        except Exception as e:\n                            print(f\"Error compressing {file_path}: {e}\")\n                    else:\n                        file_timestamps[file_name] = (current_time, check_start)\n                else:\n                    file_timestamps[file_name] = (current_time, time.time())\n\n        time.sleep(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Command Line Arguments:**\n   - The target directory is mandatory.\n   - The compression level is optional and defaults to 9 if not provided.\n\n2. **Tracking Compressed Files:**\n   - A local file named `compressed_files.txt` tracks names of files that have been compressed.\n\n3. **Monitoring and Compression:**\n   - The script continuously monitors the directory for new files.\n   - For each new file, it checks if the file is no longer being modified by observing stable modification times.\n   - Once a file is considered ready, it is compressed using gzip and recorded in the tracking file.\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - The script handles invalid directories and compression levels.\n   - It manages file operations with try-except blocks to catch and display errors gracefully."
