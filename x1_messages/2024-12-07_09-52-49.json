According to the myth, Atlas was one of the Titans who fought against the Olympian gods in the Titanomachy. After the Olympians emerged victorious, Zeus condemned Atlas to hold up the celestial heavens as a punishment for his role in the rebellion. This story has become emblematic of the burden of responsibility and the struggle against overwhelming odds."
