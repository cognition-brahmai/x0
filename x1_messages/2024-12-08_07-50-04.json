        "content": "To evaluate the line integral \u222eC (xy dx + x\u00b2 dy) using Green's theorem, where C is the boundary of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **State Green's Theorem**: Green's theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve C to a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C. It states that:\n\n   \u222eC (P dx + Q dy) = \u222cD (\u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y) dA\n\n   where P and Q have continuous partial derivatives on an open region containing D.\n\n2. **Identify P and Q**: From the given line integral, P = xy and Q = x\u00b2.\n\n3. **Compute the Partial Derivatives**:\n\n   - \u2202Q/\u2202x = \u2202(x\u00b2)/\u2202x = 2x\n\n   - \u2202P/\u2202y = \u2202(xy)/\u2202y = x\n\n4. **Set Up the Double Integral**: According to Green's theorem:\n\n   \u222eC (xy dx + x\u00b2 dy) = \u222cD (2x - x) dA = \u222cD x dA\n\n5. **Describe the Region D**: The region D is the triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1). We can describe this region using inequalities:\n\n   - 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1\n\n   - 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1 - x\n\n6. **Set Up the Iterated Integral**: We'll integrate with respect to y first, then x.\n\n   \u222cD x dA = \u222b[0 to 1] \u222b[0 to 1 - x] x dy dx\n\n7. **Evaluate the Inner Integral**:\n\n   \u222b[0 to 1 - x] x dy = x \u222b[0 to 1 - x] dy = x(1 - x)\n\n8. **Evaluate the Outer Integral**:\n\n   \u222b[0 to 1] x(1 - x) dx = \u222b[0 to 1] (x - x\u00b2) dx\n\n   Compute this integral:\n\n   \u222b(x - x\u00b2) dx = (1/2)x\u00b2 - (1/3)x\u00b3 evaluated from 0 to 1\n\n   = [(1/2)(1)\u00b2 - (1/3)(1)\u00b3] - [(1/2)(0)\u00b2 - (1/3)(0)\u00b3]\n\n   = (1/2 - 1/3) - (0) = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the value of the line integral is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
