        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, we have a shipping company with 50 cargo ships, each capable of carrying 2,000 tons and consuming 50 gallons of fuel per nautical mile. They're planning to replace 25% of these ships with newer, more efficient ones that consume only 40 gallons per nautical mile. We need to find out how much fuel consumption and emissions they can reduce overall, assuming each ship travels an average of 5,000 nautical miles per month.\n\nFirst things first, let's figure out how many ships they're replacing. 25% of 50 ships is:\n\n\\[ 50 \\times 0.25 = 12.5 \\]\n\nSince they can't replace half a ship, maybe they'll replace 12 or 13 ships. But for the sake of this calculation, I'll assume they replace 12 ships.\n\nNow, the remaining fleet would be:\n\n\\[ 50 - 12 = 38 \\] old ships.\n\nBut wait, 25% of 50 is actually 12.5, and since you can't have half a ship, perhaps they'll replace 13 ships to make it 25%. Let's check:\n\n\\[ 50 \\times 0.25 = 12.5 \\]\n\nIf they replace 13 ships, that's 26%, which is slightly more than 25%. If they replace 12, it's 24%. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects us to use 12.5 and deal with it accordingly. For now, I'll proceed with 12 ships for simplicity.\n\nSo, 12 new ships and 38 old ships.\n\nNext, let's calculate the fuel consumption for the old ships.\n\nEach old ship travels 5,000 nautical miles per month, consuming 50 gallons per nautical mile.\n\nSo, fuel consumption per old ship per month is:\n\n\\[ 5,000 \\text{ nautical miles} \\times 50 \\text{ gallons/nautical mile} = 250,000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nFor 38 old ships:\n\n\\[ 38 \\times 250,000 = 9,500,000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, for the new ships:\n\nEach new ship travels the same 5,000 nautical miles per month, but consumes only 40 gallons per nautical mile.\n\nSo, fuel consumption per new ship per month is:\n\n\\[ 5,000 \\times 40 = 200,000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nFor 12 new ships:\n\n\\[ 12 \\times 200,000 = 2,400,000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, the total fuel consumption after the replacement would be the sum of the old and new ships' consumption:\n\n\\[ 9,500,000 + 2,400,000 = 11,900,000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nBefore the replacement, with all 50 old ships:\n\nEach old ship: 250,000 gallons/month\n\nTotal:\n\n\\[ 50 \\times 250,000 = 12,500,000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSo, the reduction in fuel consumption is:\n\n\\[ 12,500,000 - 11,900,000 = 600,000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, to find the overall percentage reduction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{600,000}{12,500,000} \\times 100\\% = 4.8\\% \\]\n\nWait a minute, does that seem right? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, number of ships replaced: 25% of 50 is 12.5. Maybe I should use 12.5 ships to be precise.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nOld ships: 50 - 12.5 = 37.5 ships\n\nFuel consumption for old ships:\n\n37.5 ships \u00d7 250,000 gallons = 9,375,000 gallons\n\nNew ships: 12.5 ships \u00d7 200,000 gallons = 2,500,000 gallons\n\nTotal after replacement: 9,375,000 + 2,500,000 = 11,875,000 gallons\n\nBefore: 12,500,000 gallons\n\nReduction: 12,500,000 - 11,875,000 = 625,000 gallons\n\nPercentage reduction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{625,000}{12,500,000} \\times 100\\% = 5\\% \\]\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, using 12.5 ships, the reduction is 5%.\n\nAlternatively, if they replace 13 ships:\n\nOld ships: 50 - 13 = 37 ships\n\nFuel consumption for old ships:\n\n37 \u00d7 250,000 = 9,250,000 gallons\n\nNew ships: 13 \u00d7 200,000 = 2,600,000 gallons\n\nTotal after: 9,250,000 + 2,600,000 = 11,850,000 gallons\n\nReduction: 12,500,000 - 11,850,000 = 650,000 gallons\n\nPercentage:\n\n\\[ \\frac{650,000}{12,500,000} \\times 100\\% = 5.2\\% \\]\n\nIf they replace 12 ships:\n\nOld ships: 38 \u00d7 250,000 = 9,500,000 gallons\n\nNew ships: 12 \u00d7 200,000 = 2,400,000 gallons\n\nTotal after: 9,500,000 + 2,400,000 = 11,900,000 gallons\n\nReduction: 12,500,000 - 11,900,000 = 600,000 gallons\n\nPercentage:\n\n\\[ \\frac{600,000}{12,500,000} \\times 100\\% = 4.8\\% \\]\n\nSo, depending on whether they replace 12 or 13 ships, the percentage reduction varies between 4.8% and 5.2%.\n\nGiven that 25% of 50 is 12.5, perhaps the intended answer is 5%.\n\nBut to be precise, since you can't have half a ship, they might round to replacing 13 ships, resulting in a 5.2% reduction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that they replace exactly 12.5 ships, leading to a 5% reduction.\n\nI think the most accurate answer, considering the fractional ship, is a 5% reduction.\n\nTherefore, the overall reduction in fuel consumption and emissions achieved through this fleet upgrade is 5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5\\%} \\]"
