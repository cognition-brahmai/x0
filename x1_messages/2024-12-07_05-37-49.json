        "content": "Let's see. John wants to buy a car that costs $20,000, and he can save $400 each month. But the price of the car increases by $200 every month. I need to figure out if he'll ever be able to buy the car.\n\nFirst, I should probably set up an equation to model this situation. Let's let m be the number of months John saves. Each month, he saves $400, so after m months, he'll have saved 400m dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the car is increasing by $200 each month. So, after m months, the price of the car will be 20,000 + 200m dollars.\n\nJohn can buy the car when his savings are equal to or greater than the price of the car. So, I need to find if there's a value of m where 400m >= 20,000 + 200m.\n\nLet me solve that inequality:\n\n400m >= 20,000 + 200m\n\nSubtract 200m from both sides:\n\n200m >= 20,000\n\nNow, divide both sides by 200:\n\nm >= 100\n\nSo, after 100 months, John's savings will be equal to or greater than the price of the car.\n\nLet me check that:\n\nAfter 100 months:\n\nSavings: 400 * 100 = $40,000\n\nCar price: 20,000 + (200 * 100) = 20,000 + 20,000 = $40,000\n\nPerfect, they're equal.\n\nSo, yes, John will be able to buy the car after 100 months.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if the car's price continues to increase beyond that point. Does the car's price keep increasing indefinitely, or is there a cap? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it keeps increasing by $200 each month forever.\n\nBut in reality, after some point, the car might not continue to increase in price at the same rate, or John might decide to buy a different car, etc. But based on the information given, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at it in terms of the difference between John's savings and the car's price each month.\n\nEach month, John saves $400, and the car's price increases by $200, so the difference in their amounts each month is $400 - $200 = $200.\n\nSo, each month, the gap between what John has saved and the car's price increases by $200.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if John is saving more than the car's price is increasing, the gap should be closing, not widening.\n\nWait, no. John is saving $400 per month, and the car's price is increasing by $200 per month. So, the gap should be closing by $400 - $200 = $200 per month.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, it took 100 months for John's savings to catch up to the car's price, which matches with 20,000 / 200 = 100 months.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer.\n\nTherefore, yes, John will be able to buy the car after 100 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
