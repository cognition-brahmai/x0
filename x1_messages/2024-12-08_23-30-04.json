        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from Town A to Town B at 80 km/h and comes back at 100 km/h, and the total time for the trip is 9 hours. We need to find the distance between Town A and Town B.\n\nFirst, let's denote the distance between Town A and Town B as \\(d\\) kilometers.\n\nNow, the time taken to go from Town A to Town B at 80 km/h can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\n\\]\n\nSo, time going from A to B is:\n\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{d}{80} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the time taken to return from Town B to Town A at 100 km/h is:\n\n\\[\nt_2 = \\frac{d}{100} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThe total time for the round trip is given as 9 hours, so:\n\n\\[\nt_1 + t_2 = 9\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{80} + \\frac{d}{100} = 9\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(d\\), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 80 and 100 is 400. So, let's rewrite the equation with a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5d}{400} + \\frac{4d}{400} = 9\n\\]\n\nCombining the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5d + 4d}{400} = 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9d}{400} = 9\n\\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\(d\\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 400:\n\n\\[\n9d = 9 \\times 400\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9d = 3600\n\\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 9:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{3600}{9}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = 400\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance between Town A and Town B is 400 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. It seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: \n\nTime from A to B: \\( \\frac{d}{80} \\)\n\nTime from B to A: \\( \\frac{d}{100} \\)\n\nTotal time: \\( \\frac{d}{80} + \\frac{d}{100} = 9 \\)\n\nFinding a common denominator, which is 400:\n\n\\( \\frac{5d}{400} + \\frac{4d}{400} = 9 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{9d}{400} = 9 \\)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 400: \\( 9d = 3600 \\)\n\nDividing by 9: \\( d = 400 \\)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of average speed for the entire trip. The average speed for a round trip with different speeds is given by the harmonic mean of the speeds.\n\nThe formula for the average speed when distances are equal is:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{2v_1v_2}{v_1 + v_2}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) are the speeds in each direction.\n\nSo, \\(v_1 = 80\\) km/h and \\(v_2 = 100\\) km/h.\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{2 \\times 80 \\times 100}{80 + 100} = \\frac{16000}{180} = \\frac{1600}{18} = \\frac{800}{9} \\approx 88.89 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nNow, the total distance for the round trip is \\(2d\\), and the total time is 9 hours. So:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{2d}{9}\n\\]\n\nSetting the two expressions for \\(v_{\\text{avg}}\\) equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2d}{9} = \\frac{800}{9}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 9:\n\n\\[\n2d = 800\n\\]\n\nDividing by 2:\n\n\\[\nd = 400\n\\]\n\nAgain, we get 400 kilometers.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the time taken in each direction and ensure that the total is 9 hours.\n\nTime from A to B: \\( \\frac{400}{80} = 5 \\) hours\n\nTime from B to A: \\( \\frac{400}{100} = 4 \\) hours\n\nTotal time: \\( 5 + 4 = 9 \\) hours, which matches the given total time.\n\nSo, everything checks out. The distance between Town A and Town B is indeed 400 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
