        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. In a room full of people, 40% are wearing glasses, and 60% are wearing hats. Also, everyone is either wearing glasses or a hat, but not both. And there are 30 more people wearing hats than glasses. I need to find out how many people are in the room.\n\nOkay, first, let's understand what's given:\n\n- 40% of the people are wearing glasses.\n\n- 60% of the people are wearing hats.\n\n- No one is wearing both glasses and hats.\n\n- The number of people wearing hats is 30 more than the number wearing glasses.\n\nI need to find the total number of people in the room.\n\nLet me denote the total number of people in the room as \\( p \\).\n\nSo, the number of people wearing glasses is \\( 0.4p \\), and the number wearing hats is \\( 0.6p \\).\n\nAlso, since everyone is wearing either glasses or hats, but not both, the total percentage should add up to 100%. Wait a minute, 40% + 60% is 100%, which matches up.\n\nNow, it's given that the number of people wearing hats is 30 more than those wearing glasses. So, I can set up an equation:\n\nNumber of people wearing hats = Number of people wearing glasses + 30\n\nIn terms of \\( p \\), that's:\n\n\\( 0.6p = 0.4p + 30 \\)\n\nOkay, now I can solve for \\( p \\):\n\nSubtract \\( 0.4p \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.6p - 0.4p = 30 \\)\n\n\\( 0.2p = 30 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.2:\n\n\\( p = 30 / 0.2 \\)\n\n\\( p = 150 \\)\n\nSo, there are 150 people in the room.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIf \\( p = 150 \\), then:\n\nNumber wearing glasses = \\( 0.4 \\times 150 = 60 \\)\n\nNumber wearing hats = \\( 0.6 \\times 150 = 90 \\)\n\nAnd indeed, 90 is 30 more than 60. Also, 60 + 90 = 150, which matches the total.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The problem says \"everyone in the room is either wearing glasses or a hat, but not both.\" So, no one is wearing both, which aligns with the percentages adding up to 100%.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem?\n\nMaybe using equations.\n\nLet \\( g \\) be the number of people wearing glasses, and \\( h \\) be the number wearing hats.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\( g = 0.4p \\)\n\n\\( h = 0.6p \\)\n\nAnd:\n\n\\( h = g + 30 \\)\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the third:\n\n\\( 0.6p = 0.4p + 30 \\)\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to \\( p = 150 \\).\n\nIs there any other perspective I should consider?\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of sets.\n\nLet the total number of people be \\( p \\).\n\nNumber wearing glasses: \\( g = 0.4p \\)\n\nNumber wearing hats: \\( h = 0.6p \\)\n\nSince no one wears both, the total is just \\( g + h = p \\).\n\nGiven that \\( h = g + 30 \\), substitute into the total:\n\n\\( g + (g + 30) = p \\)\n\n\\( 2g + 30 = p \\)\n\nBut since \\( g = 0.4p \\), substitute that in:\n\n\\( 2(0.4p) + 30 = p \\)\n\n\\( 0.8p + 30 = p \\)\n\nSubtract \\( 0.8p \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( 30 = 0.2p \\)\n\nSo, \\( p = 30 / 0.2 = 150 \\)\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nMaybe I can use algebra without percentages.\n\nLet \\( p \\) be the total number of people.\n\nLet \\( g \\) be the number wearing glasses.\n\nLet \\( h \\) be the number wearing hats.\n\nWe know:\n\n\\( g + h = p \\) (since everyone wears either glasses or hats, but not both)\n\nAnd:\n\n\\( h = g + 30 \\)\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n\n\\( g + (g + 30) = p \\)\n\n\\( 2g + 30 = p \\)\n\nNow, from the percentages:\n\n\\( g = 0.4p \\)\n\nSubstitute this into the equation:\n\n\\( 2(0.4p) + 30 = p \\)\n\n\\( 0.8p + 30 = p \\)\n\nSubtract \\( 0.8p \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( 30 = 0.2p \\)\n\nSo, \\( p = 30 / 0.2 = 150 \\)\n\nConsistently getting \\( p = 150 \\).\n\nIs there a way to solve this without using algebra?\n\nMaybe by considering the difference in percentages.\n\nThe difference between the percentage wearing hats and glasses is 60% - 40% = 20%.\n\nThis 20% corresponds to the 30 extra people wearing hats.\n\nSo, 20% of total people equals 30 people.\n\nTherefore, 1% is 30 / 20 = 1.5 people.\n\nSo, 100% is 1.5 \u00d7 100 = 150 people.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if any assumptions were made.\n\nI assumed that \"everyone is either wearing glasses or a hat, but not both\" means that no one wears both, and that the percentages given are exclusive.\n\nGiven that, the approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if there were people not wearing anything, that would change things, but the problem states that everyone wears either glasses or hats, not both.\n\nSo, no, that's not the case.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the ratio of hat wearers to glasses wearers.\n\nThe ratio of hat wearers to glasses wearers is 60% to 40%, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nSo, for every 3 hat wearers, there are 2 glasses wearers.\n\nThe difference is 1 part, which corresponds to 30 people.\n\nTherefore, 1 part = 30 people.\n\nTotal parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nSo, total people = 5 \u00d7 30 = 150.\n\nOnce again, the same answer.\n\nI think it's clear that the total number of people in the room is 150.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
