        "content": "The Italian explorer you're referring to is Christopher Columbus. He embarked on four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, between 1492 and 1504. Columbus was seeking a direct maritime route to Asia but instead reached the Americas, which were then unknown to Europeans.\n\nUpon his return, Columbus believed he had reached the eastern edge of Asia, specifically the Indies, which is why the indigenous people he encountered were called \"Indians.\" However, it was later understood that he had discovered a new continent altogether.\n\nThe continents of North and South America are named after Amerigo Vespucci, another Italian explorer and cartographer, who recognized that the lands discovered by Columbus were not part of Asia but a separate continent. This realization led to the continents being named \"America\" in his honor.\n\nSo, to answer your question, it was Christopher Columbus who initially explored these lands, but it was Amerigo Vespucci who correctly identified them as a new continent, leading to the continents being named after him."
