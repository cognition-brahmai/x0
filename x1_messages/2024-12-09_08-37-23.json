The average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time taken.\n\nLet's denote the distance between City A and City B as \\( d \\) kilometers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time taken for the train to travel from City A to City B at a speed of 100 km/h. The time taken for this leg of the journey is:\n\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{d}{100} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time taken for the return journey from City B to City A at a speed of 150 km/h. The time taken for this leg is:\n\n\\[\nt_2 = \\frac{d}{150} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = d + d = 2d \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nThe total time taken for the round trip is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{100} + \\frac{d}{150}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 100 and 150 is 300. So, we can rewrite the total time as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{3d}{300} + \\frac{2d}{300} = \\frac{5d}{300} = \\frac{d}{60} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, the average speed \\( v_{\\text{avg}} \\) is the total distance divided by the total time:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{60}} = 2d \\times \\frac{60}{d} = 120 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the train for the entire trip is 120 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
