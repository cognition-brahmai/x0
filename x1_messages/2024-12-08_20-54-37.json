        "content": "So, the store has 5 types of fruits, and each type comes in 3 different sizes. You want to buy one fruit of each type, but you can choose any size for each type. You're wondering how many possible combinations there are.\n\nLet's break this down. For each type of fruit, you have 3 size options. Since there are 5 types of fruit, and you're choosing one of each type, the total number of combinations would be the product of the number of choices for each type.\n\nSo, for the first type of fruit, you have 3 sizes to choose from. For the second type, again 3 sizes, and so on, up to the fifth type.\n\nMathematically, this would be 3 choices for each of the 5 types, which is 3 raised to the power of 5, or 3^5.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, and 3^5 is 243.\n\nSo, there are 243 possible combinations.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it as a multiplication principle. For each choice of the first fruit, there are 3 choices for the second fruit, and so on.\n\nSo, it's 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3, which is indeed 3^5 = 243.\n\nAlternatively, if the order in which you choose the fruits matters, then it would be different, but in this case, since you're buying one of each type, and the types are distinct, the order doesn't matter.\n\nSo, the total number of combinations is 243.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this? Maybe if some fruits have the same size, but according to the problem, each type has 3 different sizes, and you're choosing one of each type.\n\nSo, I think 243 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{243} \\]"
