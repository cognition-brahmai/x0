While it's challenging to pinpoint a single inventor or moment, four pivotal milestones stand out in the evolution of this revolutionary technology.\n\n1. **ARPANET (1969)**: The first significant step towards the internet was the creation of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) by the U.S. Department of Defense. This project aimed to create a robust, distributed communication system that could withstand potential disruptions, such as nuclear attacks. ARPANET connected four major universities\u2014UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah\u2014using packet-switching technology, which allowed data to be broken into smaller packets and routed through multiple paths, enhancing reliability and efficiency.\n\n2. **TCP/IP Protocol Suite (1974)**: Another crucial development was the introduction of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. This set of protocols standardized how data should be transmitted and received over the network, enabling different computer systems to communicate seamlessly. In 1983, ARPANET fully switched to TCP/IP, marking the true beginning of the internet as we know it today.\n\n3. **World Wide Web (1989)**: While ARPANET and TCP/IP laid the foundation for the internet, it was the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 that transformed it into a global phenomenon. Berners-Lee proposed a system for managing and browsing hypertext documents over the internet, which led to the development of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), URL (Uniform Resource Locator), and HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). The first website went live in 1991, making information accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\n\n4. **Commercialization and Browser Wars (1990s)**: The 1990s saw the internet move from an academic and military tool to a commercial platform.
