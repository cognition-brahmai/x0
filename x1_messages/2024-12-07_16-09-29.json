        "content": "In peaks so grand, where nature doth excel,\nWhere winds do whisper secrets to the sky,\nThere mountains stand, in majesty they dwell,\nTheir snow-capped heads touch heavens' canopy.\n\nTheir slopes are clothed in emerald green attire,\nWith trees that sway, as if in dance they play,\nWhile streams descend in silvery threads of fire,\nReflecting sunbeams, in their watery way.\n\nAt dawn, when morning's first light breaks the night,\nThe mountain's face is painted gold and red,\nAs if by brush of some celestial might,\nBestowing upon them a crown instead.\n\nAnd when the moon doth rise, so full and bright,\nThe mountains seem to glow with ghostly sheen,\nA sight so pure, it takes our breath away,\nIn awe, we stand before their grandeur seen.\n\nOh, mountains fair, your beauty doth transcend,\nThe bounds of time, and human understanding,\nForever standing, through ages unfriend,\nYour splendor shines, a timeless, wondrous ranging.\n\nSo let us praise these giants of the earth,\nWhose presence fills our souls with wonderment,\nFor in their shadows, we find peace and mirth,\nAnd in their heights, a sense of great ascent.\n\nThus, Shakespeare's quill might pen your praises due,\nIn sonnets sweet, or in blank verse so fine,\nBut in my heart, your beauty ever grew,\nA love that time cannot diminish or confine.\n\n**[End of Poem]**\n"
