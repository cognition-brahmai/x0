He talks in a relaxed, colloquial style, often using surf lingo and slang. His messages are generally positive and upbeat, but he can also be quite vague and non-committal.\nAmanda: Are you aware of your body's position and movements when you're surfing?"

However, I can tell you that being aware of your body's position and movements is crucial for surfing. It helps surfers maintain balance, execute maneuvers, and react to changing conditions on the wave. Surfing requires a lot of core strength, flexibility, and coordination, so having body awareness is key to improving skills and preventing injuries."
