        "content": "So I have this problem here about candies in bags, and I need to find the probability of picking a red candy when I buy 3 bags. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in one bag. Each bag has:\n\n- 12 red candies\n\n- 8 blue candies\n\n- 10 green candies\n\nSo, the total number of candies in one bag is 12 + 8 + 10. Let me calculate that:\n\n12 + 8 = 20\n\n20 + 10 = 30\n\nSo, each bag has 30 candies.\n\nNow, if I buy 3 bags, the total number of candies will be 3 times 30, which is:\n\n3 * 30 = 90\n\nSo, there are 90 candies in total from 3 bags.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many of these are red. Since each bag has 12 red candies, for 3 bags, the total number of red candies is:\n\n3 * 12 = 36\n\nSo, there are 36 red candies out of 90 total candies.\n\nThe probability of picking a red candy is the number of red candies divided by the total number of candies. So, that would be:\n\n36 / 90\n\nI can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 6:\n\n36 \u00f7 6 = 6\n\n90 \u00f7 6 = 15\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 6/15.\n\nWait, I can simplify it further. Both 6 and 15 can be divided by 3:\n\n6 \u00f7 3 = 2\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\nSo, the probability is 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, which is the same as 40%.\n\nSo, the probability of randomly picking a red candy from all the candies in the 3 bags is 2/5 or 40%.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of candies in one bag is indeed 12 + 8 + 10 = 30. Multiplying by 3 gives 90 candies in total. The total red candies are 12 per bag times 3 bags equals 36. So, 36 red candies out of 90 total candies. The fraction 36/90 simplifies to 2/5, which is correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the probability of picking a red candy from one bag and then scale it up to three bags. But since all bags are identical, the overall probability should be the same as picking from one bag.\n\nWait, actually, since each bag has the same composition, the probability of picking a red candy doesn't change based on which bag it comes from. So, it's equivalent to picking from one bag.\n\nSo, alternatively, the probability could be directly taken from one bag: 12 red candies out of 30 total candies, which is 12/30 = 2/5, same as before.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which reinforces that 2/5 is the correct probability.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other factor that might affect this probability, like whether the candies are mixed together or not. But since the problem says \"from all the candies in those bags,\" I assume that all candies are in a single pool, so it's just a matter of total red candies over total candies.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
