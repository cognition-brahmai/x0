        "content": "Let's see. I have this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 3 yellow balls. So, in total, there are 5 + 4 + 3 = 12 balls. I need to find the probability of drawing three balls without looking and getting at least one ball of each color.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"at least one ball of each color\" means. Does that mean exactly one of each, or could it include more than one of some colors as long as all colors are represented? Wait, no, \"at least one of each color\" would mean that in the three balls I draw, there is at least one red, one blue, and one yellow. But since I'm drawing only three balls, and there are three colors, the only way to have at least one of each color is to have exactly one of each color. Because if I have two of one color and one of another, I would be missing the third color, which isn't acceptable here.\n\nSo, the favorable outcomes are the ones where I draw one red, one blue, and one yellow ball.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes when drawing three balls from twelve. Since the order doesn't matter (it's combinations, not permutations), I'll use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total outcomes = C(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12 - 3)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 220.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes: one red, one blue, and one yellow.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one red ball from five: C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one blue ball from four: C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one yellow ball from three: C(3, 1) = 3.\n\nSince these are independent choices, I multiply them together to get the total number of favorable outcomes:\n\nFavorable outcomes = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes:\n\nProbability = 60 / 220 = 3/11.\n\nWait a minute, can this be simplified further? 60 and 220 divided by 20 give 3 and 11, respectively. So, yes, 3/11 is the simplified form.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using permutations or considering the order in which the balls are drawn.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total ways to draw three balls such that there's at least one of each color. But since there are only three colors and I'm drawing three balls, the only possible way to have at least one of each color is to have exactly one of each.\n\nIs there any other scenario where I could have at least one of each color in three balls? For example, could I have two of one color and one of another, and still have at least one of each? Wait, no, if I have two of one color and one of another, that means I'm missing the third color, which doesn't satisfy \"at least one of each color.\" So, indeed, the only way is to have one of each.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability by considering the different orders in which I could draw the balls: red first, then blue, then yellow; or blue first, then yellow, then red; and so on.\n\nBut since combinations don't consider order, and I already accounted for that in my calculation, I don't need to worry about it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nLet me see: total ways to draw three balls: C(12, 3) = 220.\n\nWays to draw three balls with at least one of each color: as we determined, 60.\n\nTherefore, probability is 60/220 = 3/11.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability step by step, considering the draws one at a time.\n\nFor example, the probability that the first ball is any color is 1, since I'm definitely drawing a ball.\n\nThen, the probability that the second ball is a different color from the first.\n\nAnd the probability that the third ball is different from both the first and second.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and I might make a mistake in calculating it that way.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability of drawing three balls of the same color or two of one color and one of another, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least one of each color.\n\nWait, but in this case, since the only way to have at least one of each color is to have exactly one of each, that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nTotal ways to draw three balls: C(12, 3) = 220.\n\nWays to draw three balls all of the same color:\n\n- All red: C(5, 3) = 10.\n\n- All blue: C(4, 3) = 4.\n\n- All yellow: C(3, 3) = 1.\n\nTotal ways to draw three balls all the same color: 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.\n\nWays to draw two of one color and one of another:\n\n- Two red and one blue: C(5, 2) * C(4, 1) = 10 * 4 = 40.\n\n- Two red and one yellow: C(5, 2) * C(3, 1) = 10 * 3 = 30.\n\n- Two blue and one red: C(4, 2) * C(5, 1) = 6 * 5 = 30.\n\n- Two blue and one yellow: C(4, 2) * C(3, 1) = 6 * 3 = 18.\n\n- Two yellow and one red: C(3, 2) * C(5, 1) = 3 * 5 = 15.\n\n- Two yellow and one blue: C(3, 2) * C(4, 1) = 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nTotal ways for two of one color and one of another: 40 + 30 + 30 + 18 + 15 + 12 = 145.\n\nNow, total ways where all balls are the same color or two of one color and one of another: 15 + 145 = 160.\n\nTherefore, ways to have at least one of each color: total outcomes - unfavorable outcomes = 220 - 160 = 60.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, probability is 60 / 220 = 3/11.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as:\n\nTotal ways: C(12, 3) = 220.\n\nWays to have at least one of each color: C(5, 1) * C(4, 1) * C(3, 1) = 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.\n\nTherefore, probability = 60 / 220 = 3/11.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of probabilities step by step.\n\nProbability that the first ball is any color: 1.\n\nProbability that the second ball is a different color from the first: (total balls - first ball's color balls) / remaining balls.\n\nWait, let's think about it.\n\nSuppose I draw the first ball. It can be any color. Then, for the second ball, I need it to be a different color from the first.\n\nIf the first ball was red (probability 5/12), then the second ball needs to be either blue or yellow (4 + 3 = 7 out of the remaining 11 balls).\n\nSimilarly, if the first ball was blue (probability 4/12), the second ball needs to be either red or yellow (5 + 3 = 8 out of 11).\n\nIf the first ball was yellow (probability 3/12), the second ball needs to be either red or blue (5 + 4 = 9 out of 11).\n\nThen, for the third ball, it needs to be different from both the first and second balls.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but let's try to work through it.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the different cases based on the color of the first ball.\n\nCase 1: First ball is red (probability 5/12).\n\nThen, second ball needs to be blue or yellow (4 blue + 3 yellow = 7 out of 11 remaining balls).\n\nProbability that second ball is not red: 7/11.\n\nThen, third ball needs to be the remaining color.\n\nIf second ball is blue, then third ball needs to be yellow.\n\nIf second ball is yellow, then third ball needs to be blue.\n\nSo, within this case:\n\nProbability: (5/12) * (7/11) * (depending on second ball).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of combinations rather than step by step probabilities to avoid complexity.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with my initial calculation: probability = 60 / 220 = 3/11.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the number of ways to arrange the colors.\n\nTotal ways to draw three balls: C(12, 3) = 220.\n\nFavorable ways: one red, one blue, one yellow: 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.\n\nTherefore, probability = 60 / 220 = 3/11.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to think about the proportion of each color in the box and calculate the probability accordingly.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is sufficient and correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing at least one ball of each color when drawing three balls from the box is 3/11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{11}} \\]"
