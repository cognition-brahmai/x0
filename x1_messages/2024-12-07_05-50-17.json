I've got this riddle here:\n\n\"With pointed fangs it sits in wait.\n\nWith piercing force it doles out fate,\n\nOver bloodless victims proclaiming its might.\n\nEternally joining in a single bite.\"\n\nHmm, riddles are always tricky, but I love a good challenge. Let's break this down piece by piece.\n\nFirst line: \"With pointed fangs it sits in wait.\"\n\nOkay, so it has pointed fangs, which makes me think of something like an animal, maybe a snake or a vampire. But then it says \"sits in wait,\" which suggests it's lying in wait for something. Could it be a predator of some sort?\n\nBut then the second line: \"With piercing force it doles out fate.\"\n\nDoling out fate with piercing force. That sounds pretty serious. Maybe it's something that decides the destiny of things by piercing them. But the next line says \"over bloodless victims proclaiming its might.\" So, it affects victims that don't have blood. That rules out animals or people, I guess.\n\n\"Eternally joining in a single bite.\" Interesting. Eternally joining\u2014maybe it's something that connects things permanently? Like, with one action, it joins them together forever.\n\nLet me think about things that join things together. Like glue, or staples, or maybe even a staple in writing, like a period or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait a minute, \"bloodless victims.\" So, maybe it's something that's used on objects or ideas, not living things. Could it be a type of fastener? Like a staple or a staple gun? Let's see.\n\nA staple gun has pointed fangs, sort of, if you think of the tines of the staple. It sits in wait, waiting for someone to use it. When you use it, it pierces through papers and joins them together. And papers are bloodless victims. And it's eternal in the sense that it joins the papers together permanently, at least until someone separates them.\n\nThat seems to fit pretty well. But let's see if there's another possibility.\n\nMaybe it's a nail or a needle. A needle can pierce fabric and join things together, but again, fabric is bloodless. But a staple seems more fitting because of the pointed fangs mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, could it be a mosquito or something, but no, because it's bloodless victims.\n\nWait, maybe it's a sewing machine. It has a pointed fang, the needle, which sits in wait, and when you use it, it pierces through fabric and joins the pieces together with thread. That could work too.\n\nBut comparing the two, a staple gun seems more straightforward. It sits in wait, has pointed fangs (the staple), pierces through bloodless victims (papers), and eternally joins them in a single bite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a bookmark. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, or maybe it's a staple from a stapler. The staple itself has pointed fangs, sits in wait inside the stapler, and when you use it, it pierces through the papers and joins them together.\n\nThat seems plausible. But maybe there's a better answer.\n\nLet me consider the phrase \"proclaiming its might.\" That makes it sound a bit more dramatic than just a staple. Maybe it's a symbol or something that has significance beyond its physical action.\n\nThinking beyond office supplies, maybe it's a type of fastener used in construction, like a bolt or a nail. But those are used on materials that aren't typically considered \"bloodless victims.\" Wait, everything except living beings are bloodless, I guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of religious symbol or ritual object that pierces through something to join them together. But that seems a bit too abstract.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a piercing, like an earring or something, but that's used on living beings, which have blood. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nLet me think differently. \"Bloodless victims\" could refer to pieces of paper, as I thought earlier, or maybe to digital files or data, which are abstract and don't have blood.\n\nIf it's digital, maybe it's a type of code or algorithm that combines data in some way. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a type of connector or adapter that joins different things together permanently.\n\nBut staple seems to fit best. Let me see if there's a way to confirm this.\n\nAnother angle: \"eternally joining in a single bite.\" Eternally suggests that once joined, they remain joined indefinitely, or at least until deliberately separated.\n\nA staple does that pretty well. Once you staple papers together, they stay together until someone unstaples them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's glue. Glue joins things together permanently with a single application. But glue doesn't have pointed fangs or pierce through things; it adheres to surfaces.\n\nWait, maybe it's a sticker or seal. But again, those don't pierce through things.\n\nPerhaps it's a type of fastener used in manufacturing, like a spot welder. A spot welder uses heat to join metal pieces together with spots of welds, which do pierce and join permanently.\n\nBut spot welders are machines, and the \"pointed fangs\" might refer to the welding electrodes.\n\nThat could be a possibility, but it's more industrial than what I was initially thinking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of insect that pierces through plants or something. But plants are bloodless, I suppose.\n\nWait, plants have sap, which is their equivalent of blood in some ways. So, maybe not entirely bloodless.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe it's a type of fastener used in bookbinding, like a tack or a needle and thread.\n\nBookbinding does involve piercing through pages to join them together, and pages are definitely bloodless victims.\n\nBut again, staple seems simpler and more direct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a type of surgical staple used in medicine to join tissues together. But that's used on living beings which have blood, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a piercing used in jewelry, like a stud with a pointed end that pierces through an earlobe, but again, that's on living beings.\n\nNot quite.\n\nLet me think outside the box. Maybe it's a type of connector used in electronics, like a header or a pin that pierces through circuit boards to join components together.\n\nThat could work. Circuit boards are bloodless victims, and the connector pierces through them to join electronic components eternally, or at least until someone unsolderes them.\n\nBut that seems a bit too specific, and the \"pointed fangs\" might not fit as well with electronic connectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of fastener used in automotives, like rivets or something similar.\n\nBut again, that seems a bit off.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of fastener used in woodworking, like a dowel or a peg.\n\nDowels are inserted into holes to join pieces of wood together, but they don't necessarily pierce through; they fit into pre-drilled holes.\n\nSimilarly, nails pierce through wood, but again, it's not entirely clear.\n\nI'm starting to think that staple is the most straightforward answer.\n\nAnother thought: maybe it's a type of punctuation mark, like a staple in writing. For example, a comma or a period.\n\nWait, but punctuation marks don't physically pierce through paper; they're printed on it.\n\nUnless it's a stenographer's staple, which is used to hold together pages of stenographic notes.\n\nBut that seems too obscure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of clamp or vice that holds things together by piercing them with pointed fangs.\n\nBut clamps typically grip without piercing.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of fastener used in agriculture, like a bale staple for holding together hay bales.\n\nThat could work. Bale staples are large staples used to hold hay bales together, and hay is certainly bloodless.\n\nAnd they are joined eternally, or at least until the bale is unwrapped.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nBut I think the answer is more generic than that. Maybe it's just a staple in general, used for holding papers together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a type of clasp or brooch used to hold clothing together, like an antique brooch with sharp points that pierce through fabric.\n\nBut again, that seems a bit too specific.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of fastener used in shoemaking, like an awl or a needle used to sew the shoe parts together.\n\nBut that's part of the process, not the fastener itself.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I need to look at the riddle differently.\n\nLet's look at the last line: \"eternally joining in a single bite.\"\n\n\"Single bite\" makes me think of something piercing with a bite, like fangs.\n\nSo, perhaps it's a type of fastener that has two prongs that pierce through the material simultaneously, like a crimping tool.\n\nBut that's still somewhat vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of punch or stamp that pierces through material and joins things together.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of fastener used in upholstery, like a tacking strip or a staple used to hold fabric in place.\n\nAgain, staples keep coming back to me.\n\nMaybe I should just go with staple as the answer.\n\nBut let's consider if there's a more universal or abstract concept being referred to here.\n\nMaybe it's not a physical object but an abstract concept that joins things together forever with a symbolic piercing action.\n\nFor example, maybe it's a promise or a vow that binds people eternally.\n\nBut that doesn't really fit with \"pointed fangs\" and \"piercing force.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of bond or connection that is formed through some kind of piercing ritual, like a rite of passage.\n\nBut that seems too broad.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of seal or signet ring that impresses a design into wax or clay, joining documents together.\n\nBut seals don't necessarily pierce through things; they leave an impression.\n\nUnless it's a signet ring used to make a wax seal that secures a document shut.\n\nBut again, that's more about sealing than piercing.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nMaybe it's something as simple as a pushpin or thumbtack.\n\nA pushpin has a pointed fang, sits on a board waiting to be used, and can pierce through papers to attach them to a board.\n\nThe papers are bloodless victims, and it joins them to the board with a single bite.\n\nThat could work.\n\nSimilarly, a thumbtack can be used to attach papers to a bulletin board.\n\nBut staples are more permanent; tacks can be easily removed.\n\nThe riddle mentions \"eternally joining,\" which suggests a more permanent connection.\n\nStaples are more permanent than tacks, usually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of fastener used in photography, like a clip or a holder that pierces through photographs to keep them in place.\n\nBut that seems too specific.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of fastener used in archival practices, like a pH-neutral staple used to preserve documents.\n\nBut that's still a staple.\n\nPerhaps the answer is indeed a staple.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to interpret the riddle.\n\n\"With pointed fangs it sits in wait.\"\n\nCould it be a type of plant, like a carnivorous plant with fangs that traps insects?\n\nBut insects have blood, even if it's not red like ours.\n\nMoreover, plants don't really join things together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of mechanical device with fangs that pierces through materials.\n\nBut that's too vague.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of fastener used in textiles, like a grommet or an eyelet.\n\nGrommets are used to reinforce holes in fabric, but they don't really join things together in the same way a staple does.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a type of fastener used in aviation or aerospace, like a cleco or a self-piercing rivet.\n\nBut again, that seems too specific, and I don't want to overthink this.\n\nMaybe it's something more common and everyday, like a staple.\n\nStaples are ubiquitous in offices and homes, used to hold papers together, and they do have pointed fangs that pierce through the papers.\n\nThey sit in the stapler, waiting to be used, and when they are, they proclaim their might by joining the papers eternally, at least until someone removes them.\n\nThat seems to fit all the parts of the riddle.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is a staple.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{staple}} \\]"
