        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a simple Node.js application that does what you've described. Let's break it down into steps to make sure we cover everything.\n\nFirst, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Node.js website.\n\nOnce you have Node.js installed, let's set up a new project.\n\n1. **Initialize a new Node.js project:**\n\n   Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project. Let's call it `simple-form`.\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir simple-form\n   cd simple-form\n   ```\n\n   Now, initialize a new Node.js project by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n   This will create a `package.json` file with some default settings.\n\n2. **Install necessary dependencies:**\n\n   For this application, we'll need Express, a popular Node.js framework for handling HTTP requests, and BodyParser, which helps in parsing the request bodies.\n\n   Install Express and BodyParser by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install express body-parser\n   ```\n\n3. **Create the server:**\n\n   Create a new file called `server.js` in your project directory.\n\n   Open `server.js` and set up the basic structure of the server.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\n   const app = express();\n   const port = 3000;\n\n   // Use bodyParser to parse JSON and URL-encoded forms\n   app.use(bodyParser.json());\n   app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n\n   // Serve the HTML form\n   app.get('/', (req, res) => {\n       const html = `\n       <html>\n       <head><title>Simple Form</title></head>\n       <body>\n           <h1>Submit Data</h1>\n           <form action=\"/submit\" method=\"POST\">\n               <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n               <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\"><br><br>\n               <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n               <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\"><br><br>\n               <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n           </form>\n       </body>\n       </html>\n       `;\n       res.send(html);\n   });\n\n   // Handle form submission\n   app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {\n       const data = req.body;\n       const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();\n\n       // Log the received data\n       console.log('Received data:', data);\n\n       // Respond with JSON containing submitted data and timestamp\n       res.json({\n           data: data,\n           timestamp: timestamp\n       });\n   });\n\n   // Start the server\n   app.listen(port, () => {\n       console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the server:**\n\n   Save the `server.js` file and go back to your terminal. Start the server by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   node server.js\n   ```\n\n   You should see the message \"Server is running on http://localhost:3000\".\n\n5. **Test the application:**\n\n   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a simple HTML form with fields for Name and Email.\n\n   Fill in the form and click the Submit button. You should see a JSON response in the browser that includes the data you submitted and a timestamp. Additionally, the server should log the received data in the terminal where you ran `node server.js`.\n\nThat's it! You've created a basic Node.js application that serves an HTML form, handles form submissions, logs the data, and responds with a JSON object containing the submitted data and a timestamp.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
