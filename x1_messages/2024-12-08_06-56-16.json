        "content": "Let's see. John wants to buy a shirt that costs $45. He already has $20, and his mother gives him an additional $10. We need to find out if he has enough to buy the shirt.\n\nFirst, I'll add up the money John has. He has $20 initially, and his mother gives him $10 more. So, $20 plus $10 is $30.\n\nNow, the shirt costs $45, and John has $30. To find out if he has enough, I need to see if $30 is greater than or equal to $45.\n\nWell, $30 is less than $45. So, he doesn't have enough money right now.\n\nBut maybe he can do something to get the remaining amount. Let's calculate how much more he needs.\n\nIf the shirt is $45 and he has $30, then $45 minus $30 is $15. So, he needs an additional $15 to buy the shirt.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shirt is on sale or he can find a cheaper one.\n\nWait, the question is just to determine if he has enough with the money he already has and what his mother gave him.\n\nSo, to answer the question: No, John does not have enough money to buy the shirt yet. He needs $15 more.\n\nMaybe he can do some chores or find a way to earn the extra $15.\n\nBut according to the information given, he has $30 and the shirt costs $45, so he can't buy it yet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No, John does not have enough money to buy the shirt yet.}} \\]"
