        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. The company wants to double its overall cargo capacity within five years. Currently, they have 20 ships, each with a carrying capacity of 10,000 tons. So, first, I need to figure out what their current total capacity is.\n\nTo find the current total capacity, I'll multiply the number of ships by the capacity of each ship:\n\n20 ships * 10,000 tons/ship = 200,000 tons\n\nThey want to double this capacity, so the target total capacity is:\n\n2 * 200,000 tons = 400,000 tons\n\nNow, they already have 200,000 tons in capacity from their existing fleet, so the additional capacity needed is:\n\n400,000 tons - 200,000 tons = 200,000 tons\n\nEach new ship has a carrying capacity of 12,000 tons. To find out how many new ships are required to meet the additional capacity needed, I'll divide the additional capacity by the capacity of each new ship:\n\n200,000 tons / 12,000 tons/ship = approximately 16.67 ships\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a ship, the company would need to purchase 17 new ships to meet or exceed the additional capacity required.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the investment needed for these new ships. Each new ship costs $30 million. So, the total investment would be:\n\n17 ships * $30 million/ship = $510 million\n\nTherefore, the company needs to invest $510 million to purchase 17 new ships, each with a carrying capacity of 12,000 tons, to double their overall cargo capacity within five years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17 \\text{ ships, } \\$510 \\text{ million}} \\]"
