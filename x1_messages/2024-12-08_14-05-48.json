        "content": "So, the car is going at a steady speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours to get from Town A to Town B. We need to find out how far apart these two towns are.\n\nWell, to find the distance when we know the speed and time, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nHere, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 2 hours. So, plugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours\n\nWhen you multiply these, the 'hours' unit cancels out, leaving you with miles.\n\nSo, Distance = 120 miles\n\nTherefore, Town A and Town B are 120 miles apart.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If the car is going at 60 miles per hour, that means it covers 60 miles in one hour. So, in two hours, it should cover twice that distance, which is 120 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using conversion factors or something like that?\n\nWell, 60 miles per hour is the same as 60 miles per 60 minutes, which simplifies to 1 mile per minute. So, in 2 hours, which is 120 minutes, the car would travel 120 miles. That matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to use the formula for distance in terms of velocity and time, it's still the same: distance equals velocity times time, assuming constant velocity. Since the problem states that the car is traveling at a constant speed, we can use this formula directly.\n\nIs there any chance that speed could be different at different times? The problem says it's constant, so no, it's fine.\n\nLet me consider if there's another approach, like using graphs. If we plot speed against time, the area under the curve gives us the distance. In this case, since the speed is constant, the graph would be a horizontal line at 60 miles per hour. Over 2 hours, the area under the line would be a rectangle with height 60 and width 2, so area = 60 \u00d7 2 = 120 miles.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overthinking this. It's a straightforward problem, and the answer is clearly 120 miles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the units again. Speed is in miles per hour, time is in hours, so multiplying them gives miles, which is the unit for distance. That's correct.\n\nAlso, if the speed was in a different unit, say kilometers per hour, we'd need to convert it, but since it's miles per hour and the expected answer is in miles, we don't need to do any conversion.\n\nWait, but sometimes problems like this might trick you by using different units, like miles and hours vs. feet and seconds, but in this case, it's consistent.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the car is moving at a constant speed throughout the entire journey. The problem says it's traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, so we can assume that it is.\n\nBut in real life, there might be stops or speed variations, but according to the problem, it's constant, so we don't need to worry about that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the distance between Town A and Town B is 120 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
