        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 30 students, and there are 8 more girls than boys. We need to find out how many girls and how many boys there are.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys in the class.\n\n- Since there are 8 more girls than boys, the number of girls would be \\( b + 8 \\).\n\nNow, we know that the total number of students is 30, which is the sum of boys and girls. So, we can write an equation:\n\n\\[ b + (b + 8) = 30 \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 2b + 8 = 30 \\]\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2b = 22 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ b = 11 \\]\n\nSo, there are 11 boys in the class.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, we can use the earlier expression:\n\n\\[ g = b + 8 = 11 + 8 = 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 19 girls in the class.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. If there are 11 boys and 19 girls, that adds up to 30 students, which matches the total given. Also, there are indeed 8 more girls than boys (19 - 11 = 8), so that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, we could have approached this using a different method. For example, suppose we let \\( g \\) represent the number of girls, and \\( b \\) represent the number of boys.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. \\( g + b = 30 \\) (total students)\n\n2. \\( g = b + 8 \\) (8 more girls than boys)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first:\n\n\\[ (b + 8) + b = 30 \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 2b + 8 = 30 \\]\n\nThen, solving for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ 2b = 22 \\]\n\n\\[ b = 11 \\]\n\nAnd then find \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ g = 11 + 8 = 19 \\]\n\nSame result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that if there were an equal number of boys and girls, there would be 15 of each (since 30 divided by 2 is 15). But since there are 8 more girls than boys, we need to add 4 to the girls and subtract 4 from the boys to get the difference of 8.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf both boys and girls were 15, that's equal. But since there are 8 more girls, we can add 4 to girls and subtract 4 from boys to get the difference of 8.\n\nSo:\n\nGirls: 15 + 4 = 19\n\nBoys: 15 - 4 = 11\n\nAgain, same numbers as before.\n\nThis confirms that there are 19 girls and 11 boys in the class.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using ratios or something else, but given the information, the methods above seem straightforward and sufficient.\n\nIt's important to check that the answers make sense in the context of the problem. In this case, 19 girls and 11 boys add up to 30, and the difference is 8, which matches the given conditions.\n\nSo, the final answer is 19 girls and 11 boys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19 \\text{ girls and } 11 \\text{ boys}} \\]"
