        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: If a restaurant serves 100 meals every day, how many meals does it serve in a leap year, which has 366 days? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. A leap year has 366 days, and the restaurant serves 100 meals each day. So, basically, I need to find out the total number of meals served over those 366 days.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to multiply the number of meals served per day by the number of days in the leap year. So, that would be 100 meals/day times 366 days.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal meals = meals per day \u00d7 number of days\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal meals = 100 \u00d7 366\n\nNow, I need to calculate 100 multiplied by 366. Multiplying by 100 is straightforward; I just need to add two zeros to 366.\n\nSo, 100 \u00d7 366 = 36,600\n\nTherefore, the restaurant serves 36,600 meals in a leap year.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there a possibility that the restaurant doesn't serve meals every day, maybe on holidays or something? But the problem says \"every day,\" so I think it's safe to assume that it's 100 meals daily without any breaks.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm using the correct number of days in a leap year. I know that a leap year has 366 days, but just to be thorough, I'll double-check. Yes, a leap year has an extra day in February, making it 29 days instead of 28, which adds up to 366 days in total.\n\nSo, my calculation seems solid. I've multiplied the daily meal count by the number of days in a leap year, and I've got 36,600 meals.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can verify this with a different approach. For example, I could calculate the number of meals served in a non-leap year and then adjust for the extra day in a leap year.\n\nA non-leap year has 365 days, so:\n\nMeals in a non-leap year = 100 \u00d7 365 = 36,500 meals\n\nSince a leap year has one extra day, I just need to add another 100 meals for that extra day:\n\nTotal meals in leap year = 36,500 + 100 = 36,600 meals\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. Good, that gives me more confidence that I'm correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 366 days is about 52 weeks and 2 extra days, but that seems more complicated for this straightforward multiplication problem. So, I'll stick with my initial approach.\n\nI should also consider units. Meals per day times days gives me total meals, which is what the question is asking for. So, units are consistent.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe checking for calculation errors, but 100 times 366 is pretty straightforward. I don't think I made a mistake there.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The restaurant serves 36,600 meals in a leap year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36600} \\]"
