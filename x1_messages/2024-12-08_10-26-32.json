        "content": "So the restaurant serves 300 meals on average per day, and each meal generates an average profit of $8. We need to find out how much profit the restaurant makes in a month, assuming a month has 30 days.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the daily profit. Since each meal brings in $8 in profit and they serve 300 meals per day, the daily profit should be 300 meals times $8 per meal. So, that's 300 * 8.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 300 times 8 is 2,400. So, the restaurant makes $2,400 in profit each day.\n\nNow, to find the monthly profit, I need to multiply the daily profit by the number of days in a month. We're assuming a month has 30 days, so it's 2,400 times 30.\n\nLet's calculate that: 2,400 times 30. Well, 2,400 times 10 is 24,000, so 2,400 times 30 would be three times that, which is 72,000.\n\nSo, the restaurant makes $72,000 in profit in a month.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 300 meals per day at $8 each: 300 * 8 = 2,400. That seems right.\n\nThen, 2,400 per day times 30 days: 2,400 * 30.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 2,400 * 30.\n\nLet me break it down: 2,000 times 30 is 60,000, and 400 times 30 is 12,000. Adding those together, 60,000 + 12,000 equals 72,000.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the restaurant's monthly profit is $72,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72000} \\]"
