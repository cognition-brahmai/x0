        "content": "So, there's this shirt that's originally priced at $40, and it's on sale for 25% off. I need to find out what the final cost of the shirt is after applying this discount. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 25% discount means. Percentages can be a bit tricky, but I think I've got it. So, 25% off means I'm saving 25% of the original price. That makes sense. So, to find out how much I'm saving, I need to calculate 25% of $40.\n\nTo calculate 25% of $40, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. I know that 25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal form. So, I can multiply $40 by 0.25 to find out the discount amount.\n\nLet me do that: $40 times 0.25 equals... hmm, 40 times 0.25. Well, 40 times 0.2 is 8, and 40 times 0.05 is 2, so adding those together, it's $10. So, the discount is $10.\n\nNow, to find the final cost, I need to subtract the discount from the original price. So, $40 minus $10 equals $30. Therefore, the final cost of the shirt after the discount is $30.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of calculating the discount and then subtracting it, I could find out what percentage of the original price I actually have to pay. Since it's 25% off, that means I'm paying 75% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 25% is 75%.\n\nSo, if I calculate 75% of $40, that should give me the final cost directly. Let's try that. 75% as a decimal is 0.75. So, $40 times 0.75 equals... 40 times 0.7 is 28, and 40 times 0.05 is 2, so together that's $30 again. Okay, that matches my first method.\n\nIt's good that both methods give me the same answer, which reinforces that $30 is indeed the final cost of the shirt after the discount.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about this in yet another way. Suppose I use fractions instead of decimals. 25% is the same as 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4. So, a 25% discount means I'm getting 1/4 off the original price.\n\nSo, 1/4 of $40 is $10, which again confirms that the discount is $10, and subtracting that from $40 gives $30.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of paying 75% of the original price, 75% is 75/100, which is 3/4. So, 3/4 of $40 is $30. Same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, and each method leads me to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the final cost of the shirt after a 25% discount is $30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
