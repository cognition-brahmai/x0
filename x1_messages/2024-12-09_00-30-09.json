        "content": "The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model used for pricing options contracts, specifically European call and put options on non-dividend-paying stocks. The model was developed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in 1973 and is widely regarded as one of the most important contributions to modern financial theory.\n\n### Assumptions of the Black-Scholes Model\n\n1. **European Option**: The option can only be exercised at expiration.\n2. **No Dividends**: The underlying stock does not pay dividends during the life of the option.\n3. **Constant Volatility**: The volatility of the underlying stock is constant over the life of the option.\n4. **Risk-Free Interest Rate**: The risk-free interest rate is constant and known.\n5. **No Transaction Costs or Taxes**: There are no transaction costs or taxes in buying or selling the underlying stock or the option.\n6. **Market is Efficient**: There are no arbitrage opportunities in the market.\n\n### Black-Scholes Formula for a European Call Option\n\nThe Black-Scholes formula for a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(S, t) = S N(d_1) - X e^{-r(T - t)} N(d_2)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( C(S, t) \\) is the price of the call option at time \\( t \\).\n- \\( S \\) is the current stock price.\n- \\( X \\) is the strike price of the option.\n- \\( r \\) is the risk-free interest rate.\n- \\( T - t \\) is the time to expiration.\n- \\( N(\\cdot) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n- \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) are given by:\n\n\\[\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S}{X}\\right) + \\left(r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)(T - t)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T - t}\n\\]\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the volatility of the stock's returns.\n\n### Derivation of the Black-Scholes Formula\n\nThe derivation of the Black-Scholes formula involves several steps, including the construction of a riskless portfolio and the application of Ito's lemma from stochastic calculus. Here is a high-level overview of the derivation:\n\n1. **Assume a Riskless Portfolio**:\n   - Construct a portfolio consisting of the option and a certain number of shares of the underlying stock.\n   - Choose the number of shares such that the portfolio is instantaneously riskless.\n\n2. **Apply Ito's Lemma**:\n   - Use Ito's lemma to find the stochastic differential of the option price.\n   - Set up the portfolio such that the stochastic component cancels out, making the portfolio riskless.\n\n3. **Set Portfolio Return Equal to Risk-Free Rate**:\n   - Since the portfolio is riskless, its return should equal the risk-free rate.\n   - This leads to the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} + r S \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} - r C = 0\n\\]\n\n4. **Solve the Black-Scholes PDE**:\n   - Solve the PDE with the boundary condition that at expiration \\( t = T \\), the call option pays \\( \\max(S - X, 0) \\).\n   - The solution is the Black-Scholes formula for the call option.\n\n### Explanation of the Formula\n\n- **First Term \\( S N(d_1) \\)**:\n  - This represents the present value of the expected stock price at expiration, adjusted for the probability that the option will be exercised.\n  - \\( N(d_1) \\) is the probability that the stock price will be above the strike price at expiration, adjusted for the volatility and time to expiration.\n\n- **Second Term \\( X e^{-r(T - t)} N(d_2) \\)**:\n  - This represents the present value of the strike price, adjusted for the probability that the option will be exercised.\n  - \\( N(d_2) \\) is the risk-neutral probability that the stock price will be above the strike price at expiration.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Black-Scholes model provides a theoretical estimate of the price of European call and put options on non-dividend-paying stocks. It is a foundational model in financial mathematics and has been extended and modified to handle various real-world complexities, such as dividends, stochastic volatility, and other factors."
