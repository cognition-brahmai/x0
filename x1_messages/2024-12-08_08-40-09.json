A table sits in the center, with a single lamp casting long shadows. Detective Jameson, a seasoned investigator in his late forties, sits across from the suspect, Evelyn Carter, a woman in her early thirties with a composed demeanor.**\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (leaning forward, eyes locked on Evelyn) So, Evelyn, you're telling me you had nothing to do with your husband's death? \n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (maintaining eye contact) That's right, Detective. I loved my husband. I would never hurt him.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (smiling slightly, but coldly) Love can be a powerful motivator, Evelyn. Especially when it turns to jealousy or resentment.\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (her voice steady) There was no jealousy, no resentment. Our marriage had its ups and downs, but I would never have killed him.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (leaning back, steepling his fingers) Interesting. So, let's talk about those 'ups and downs.' Care to elaborate?\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (pausing, choosing her words carefully) We had arguments, like any couple. Disagreements over money, career choices...but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (nodding slowly) And where were you last night between 10 PM and midnight?\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (hesitating slightly) I was at home, asleep. I had a long day at work.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (raising an eyebrow) Alone?\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (firmly) Yes, alone.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (producing a photograph, pushing it across the table) Then why does this security camera show you entering the building around 11 PM?\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (looking at the photo, her face paling) That's not me.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (smirking) Oh, come on, Evelyn. It's a pretty clear image. That's you, all right.\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (defensive) Maybe it's a different angle, or poor lighting. It's not me.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (leaning in again) Or maybe you had a reason to go back to the building after everyone had left.\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (voice trembling slightly) I...I was forgetting something. A file I needed for work.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (skeptical) And you thought of this at 11 PM? Why not just come in the next morning?\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (frustrated) Because it was urgent. I had to have it for a meeting the next day.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (pausing, considering) And where is this file now?\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (hesitant) I...I must have left it at home. I can show you.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (standing up, walking around the table) Or perhaps you planted it to make it look like you were there for work.\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (standing up as well, matching his intensity) That's not true! I'm telling you, I had a valid reason to be there.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (getting in her face) Then why are you so scared, Evelyn? What are you hiding?\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (backing away slightly, her composure cracking) I'm not hiding anything! I didn't kill him!\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (grabbing her arms, squeezing tightly) Then convince me, Evelyn. Convince me that you're telling the truth.\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (struggling to free herself) Let go of me! I didn't do it!\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (releasing her abruptly, stepping back) Sit down, Evelyn. We both know the truth is somewhere in there. (points to her head) It's just a matter of time before it comes out.\n\n**Evelyn Carter:** (sitting down, breathing heavily) I have nothing else to say.\n\n**Detective Jameson:** (smiling again, but with no warmth) We'll see about that, Evelyn. We'll see about that.\n\n**FADE OUT.**"
