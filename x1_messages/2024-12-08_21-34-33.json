        "content": "To design a Ruby script that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other, ignoring case and spaces, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Accept two strings from the user.\n2. **Preprocessing**: Convert both strings to lowercase and remove spaces.\n3. **Anagram Check**: Compare the sorted versions of the processed strings. If they are equal, the strings are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.\n\nHere is a step-by-step implementation of the script:\n\n```ruby\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2)\n  # Convert both strings to lowercase and remove spaces\n  processed_str1 = str1.downcase.gsub(\" \", \"\")\n  processed_str2 = str2.downcase.gsub(\" \", \"\")\n  \n  # Sort the characters of both processed strings\n  sorted_str1 = processed_str1.chars.sort.join\n  sorted_str2 = processed_str2.chars.sort.join\n  \n  # Compare the sorted strings\n  sorted_str1 == sorted_str2\nend\n\n# Accept two strings from the user\nprint \"Enter the first string: \"\nstring1 = gets.chomp\n\nprint \"Enter the second string: \"\nstring2 = gets.chomp\n\n# Check if they are anagrams\nif are_anagrams(string1, string2)\n  puts \"The strings are anagrams.\"\nelse\n  puts \"The strings are not anagrams.\"\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - We use `gets.chomp` to read input strings from the user.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**:\n   - `downcase` is used to convert both strings to lowercase to make the check case-insensitive.\n   - `gsub(\" \", \"\")` is used to remove spaces from both strings.\n\n3. **Anagram Check**:\n   - `chars.sort.join` is used to sort the characters of the processed strings and convert them back to strings.\n   - We compare the sorted strings. If they are equal, the original strings are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.\n\nThis script efficiently checks for anagrams by normalizing the input and comparing sorted versions of the strings, ensuring that the check is case-insensitive and ignores spaces."
