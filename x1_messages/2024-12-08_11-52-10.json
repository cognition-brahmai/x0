        "content": "The pi\u00f1ata has its origins in China, where it was a part of the New Year celebrations. It was later adopted by the Spanish and incorporated into their Christmas traditions. The pi\u00f1ata is a hollow figure made of paper mache, often shaped like an animal or other object, filled with treats and suspended from a rope. Participants are blindfolded and take turns hitting the pi\u00f1ata with a stick until it breaks, releasing the treats inside. The pi\u00f1ata has become a popular element in many Latin American and Mexican celebrations, symbolizing good luck and abundance."
