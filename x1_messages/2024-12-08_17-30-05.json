        "content": "To find the area of the garden in square yards, we first need to calculate the area in square feet and then convert that to square yards.\n\nThe garden is rectangular, measuring 25 feet by 35 feet. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nSo, plugging in the given dimensions:\n\n\\[ A = 25 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 35 \\, \\text{feet} = 875 \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\nNow, we need to convert square feet to square yards. We know that 1 yard equals 3 feet. Therefore, 1 square yard equals \\( 3 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 3 \\, \\text{feet} = 9 \\, \\text{square feet} \\).\n\nTo find the area in square yards, we divide the area in square feet by the number of square feet in one square yard:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area in square yards} = \\frac{875 \\, \\text{square feet}}{9 \\, \\text{square feet per square yard}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Area in square yards} = 97.\\overline{2} \\, \\text{square yards} \\]\n\nSo, the area of the garden is approximately 97.22 square yards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{97.\\overline{2}} \\]"
