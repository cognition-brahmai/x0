        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In a town, 60% of the people have cats, and 40% have dogs. Also, 20% have both cats and dogs. I need to find out what percentage of people don't have any pets.\n\nOkay, so I know that some people have both cats and dogs, and I need to consider that overlap. I think I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.\n\nFirst, I'll add the percentages of people who have cats and who have dogs: 60% + 40% = 100%. But wait, that includes people who have both pets twice, once in the cat category and once in the dog category.\n\nSince 20% have both, I need to subtract that overlap from the total to avoid double-counting. So, 100% - 20% = 80%. That means 80% of people have at least one pet, either a cat or a dog or both.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of people who don't have any pets, I'll subtract that 80% from 100%. So, 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nTherefore, 20% of the people in the town do not have any pets.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I denote:\n\n- C as the set of people who have cats.\n\n- D as the set of people who have dogs.\n\nI know that:\n\n- |C| = 60%\n\n- |D| = 40%\n\n- |C \u2229 D| = 20%\n\nThe percentage of people who have at least one pet is |C \u222a D|, which is equal to |C| + |D| - |C \u2229 D| = 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%.\n\nThen, the percentage without any pets is 100% - |C \u222a D| = 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of actual numbers. Suppose the town has 100 people for simplicity.\n\n- 60 people have cats.\n\n- 40 people have dogs.\n\n- 20 people have both cats and dogs.\n\nSo, the number of people who have only cats is 60 - 20 = 40.\n\nThe number of people who have only dogs is 40 - 20 = 20.\n\nThen, the total number of people who have at least one pet is 40 (only cats) + 20 (only dogs) + 20 (both) = 80.\n\nTherefore, the number of people without any pets is 100 - 80 = 20, which is 20%.\n\nHmm, this matches my previous calculation.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are people who have other pets, but the problem only mentions cats and dogs. So, probably, the only pets are cats and dogs in this context.\n\nAlternatively, if \"pets\" could include other animals, but the problem specifies only cats and dogs, so perhaps the 80% have either cats or dogs or both, and the remaining 20% have no pets at all.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach using probabilities.\n\nLet me consider a person selected at random from the town.\n\nThe probability that they have a cat is 60%, have a dog is 40%, and have both is 20%.\n\nThe probability that they have at least one pet is P(C \u222a D) = P(C) + P(D) - P(C \u2229 D) = 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that they have no pets is 1 - P(C \u222a D) = 1 - 80% = 20%.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
