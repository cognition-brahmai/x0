        "content": "So I've got this quadratic equation to solve: x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0. I need to find the values of x that make this equation true. I remember there are a few ways to solve quadratic equations, like factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let's see which one works best here.\n\nFirst, I'll try factoring because it's usually the simplest method if the equation factors easily. So, I need to factor x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 into two binomials. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add up to -5 (the coefficient of the x term).\n\nLet me think about the factors of 6. The pairs are:\n\n1 and 6\n\n2 and 3\n\nAlso, since 6 is positive and -5 is negative, both numbers should be negative. So, -2 and -3 multiply to 6 and add up to -5. Perfect!\n\nTherefore, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nNow, to find the values of x that satisfy this equation, I set each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 2 = 0  or  x - 3 = 0\n\nSolving these gives:\n\nx = 2  or  x = 3\n\nLet me check these solutions by plugging them back into the original equation.\n\nFirst, x = 2:\n\n(2)\u00b2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0\n\nGood, that works.\n\nNow, x = 3:\n\n(3)\u00b2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0\n\nAlso correct.\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nAlternatively, if factoring was not straightforward, I could have used the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [ -b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac) ] / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients from the quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = 6. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nx = [ -(-5) \u00b1 \u221a( (-5)\u00b2 - 4(1)(6) ) ] / (2*1)\n\nx = [5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 - 24)] / 2\n\nx = [5 \u00b1 \u221a1] / 2\n\nx = [5 \u00b1 1] / 2\n\nSo, x = (5 + 1)/2 = 6/2 = 3 or x = (5 - 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2\n\nWhich matches the solutions I found by factoring.\n\nAnother method is completing the square. Let's try that as well for practice.\n\nStarting with x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nFirst, move the constant term to the other side:\n\nx\u00b2 - 5x = -6\n\nNow, to complete the square, I need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x. The coefficient of x is -5, so half of that is -5/2, and squaring it gives 25/4.\n\nx\u00b2 - 5x + 25/4 = -6 + 25/4\n\nNow, the left side is a perfect square:\n\n(x - 5/2)\u00b2 = -24/4 + 25/4\n\n(x - 5/2)\u00b2 = 1/4\n\nTaking square roots of both sides:\n\nx - 5/2 = \u00b1\u221a(1/4)\n\nx - 5/2 = \u00b11/2\n\nSo, x = 5/2 + 1/2 or x = 5/2 - 1/2\n\nx = 6/2 = 3 or x = 4/2 = 2\n\nAgain, the same solutions.\n\nAll three methods lead to x = 2 and x = 3. So, I'm confident these are the correct solutions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ and } 3} \\]"
