        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, you've got a basket with 6 apples and 8 oranges, making a total of 14 fruits. The first part is to find the probability of picking an apple at random.\n\nTo find the probability of an event, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is picking an apple, and the total possible outcomes are picking any fruit from the basket.\n\nSo, the probability of picking an apple first is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Apple first}) = \\frac{6}{14} = \\frac{3}{7} \\]\n\nNow, the second part of the question involves picking a second fruit without replacing the first one, and we need to find the probability that both fruits picked are apples.\n\nThis is a case of dependent events because the outcome of the first pick affects the second pick.\n\nFirst, we already have the probability of picking an apple first, which is \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\).\n\nNext, given that the first fruit picked was an apple, there are now 5 apples left and a total of 13 fruits remaining in the basket.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another apple is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Apple second} | \\text{Apple first}) = \\frac{5}{13} \\]\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening (both picks being apples), we multiply the probabilities of the individual events:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Both apples}) = P(\\text{Apple first}) \\times P(\\text{Apple second} | \\text{Apple first}) = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{13} = \\frac{15}{91} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that both fruits picked are apples is \\( \\frac{15}{91} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe probability that both fruits picked are apples is \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{91}}."
