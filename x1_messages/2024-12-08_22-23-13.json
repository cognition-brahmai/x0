        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a town, 5 out of every 7 people own a car. There are 210 people in the town, and I need to find out how many don't own a car. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"5 out of every 7 people own a car\" means. This is a ratio, right? It means that for every 7 people, 5 have cars. So, the proportion of people who own cars is 5/7.\n\nNow, if there are 210 people in the town, I can find out how many own cars by multiplying the total number of people by the proportion that owns cars. So, number of car owners = 210 * (5/7).\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 210 divided by 7 is 30, because 7*30=210. Then, 30 multiplied by 5 is 150. So, 150 people own cars.\n\nBut the question asks for how many do not own a car. So, I need to subtract the number of car owners from the total population. Number of people without cars = total people - car owners = 210 - 150 = 60.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can find the proportion of people who don't own cars directly. If 5 out of 7 own cars, then 2 out of 7 don't own cars, right? Because 7 - 5 = 2.\n\nSo, the proportion of people without cars is 2/7. Then, I can find the number of people without cars by multiplying the total population by this proportion: number of people without cars = 210 * (2/7).\n\nLet's do that calculation. 210 divided by 7 is 30, and 30 multiplied by 2 is 60. So, again, I get 60 people without cars.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like 60 people in the town do not own a car.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check if these numbers make sense. If 5 out of 7 people own cars, that's approximately 71.4% (since 5 divided by 7 is about 0.714), and 2 out of 7 don't, which is about 28.6%. Adding those up, 71.4% + 28.6% equals 100%, which checks out.\n\nAlso, with 210 people, dividing by 7 gives 30, which seems reasonable. Then, multiplying by 5 or 2 gives 150 and 60, respectively, which add up to 210. So, everything seems consistent.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is 60 people do not own a car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
