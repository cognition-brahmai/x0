The son spent half of the money on apples, a quarter of the remaining amount on oranges, and the rest on candy. I need to figure out how much he spent on candy.\n\nFirst, he spent half of the $100 on apples. Half of $100 is $50, so he spent $50 on apples.\n\nNow, he has $100 - $50 = $50 left.\n\nNext, he spent a quarter of the remaining amount on oranges. The remaining amount is $50, so a quarter of $50 is $50 / 4 = $12.50. So, he spent $12.50 on oranges.\n\nNow, he has $50 - $12.50 = $37.50 left.\n\nThe rest was spent on candy, which is $37.50.\n\nSo, he spent $37.50 on candy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37.50} \\]"
