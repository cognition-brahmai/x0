And Michelle Williams` emotional words about how she`s having trouble coping with Heath Ledger`s death. HILTON: It was such a huge campaign and history, and to be involved in it was fun. And you know, I had fun with it. HAMMER: Are you kidding me? SHOWBIZ TONIGHT is right there at the American Music Awards. Paris Hilton opening us to about her failed run for the White House. And Kanye West says he wants to be bigger than Elvis. Thank you very much. But tonight, SHOWBIZ TONIGHT`s got to say, are you kidding me? TV`s most provocative entertainment news show continues right now. ANDERSON: And I`m Brooke Anderson, coming to you tonight from Hollywood. HAMMER: Well, tonight, Kanye West, the next Elvis? Paris Hilton, presidential prognosticator? Yes, these are just two of the outrage moments from last night in Hollywood as SHOWBIZ TONIGHT was right there for the American Music Awards. Chris Brown and Rihanna were big winners as was the ever-humble Kanye West who compared himself to Elvis. Really, Kanye, Elvis? SHOWBIZ TONIGHT had the AMAs covered from the red carpet to backstage. We were running into everyone from Miley Cyrus to the Jonas Brothers to Taylor Swift. And yes, even Paris Hilton who revealed to us how she feels her fake run for the White House affected the real election. And she has some serious thoughts. With me tonight in New York, Ben Widdicombe who`s the editor-at-large of \"Star\" magazine. And in Hollywood tonight is Laura Saltman. She`s a correspondent for \"AccessHollywood.com.\" All right. We`ve got to start off with Kanye West. Now, Kanye always has a lot to say when he loses awards. And now, he`s running off at the mouth after winning an AMA he won for favorite rap or hip hop album. Watch Kanye. KANYE WEST, RAP ARTIST: I`m going to push this music to the point where it was like in the `60s, in the `70s where you talk about Led Zeppelin and Hendrix and the Beatles. We will be the new Beatles, the new Hendrix. They say in any other industry, you know, you`re supposed to do better than the past, you know, like computers should get smaller and faster. But whenever you say, \"I want to be Elvis,\" they say, \"What`s wrong with you?\" But I want to be Elvis. HAMMER: Ben, I don`t know - are you like me? Do you think the sure fire way to turn people off and not become as big as Elvis is to say you want to be Elvis? WIDDICOMBE: Well, personally, I don`t see what is so wrong with aspiring to be as great as Elvis. But he really did seem to violate some unwritten rule of American hubris by saying that because he`s got such criticism. The blogs have gone off. Everyone is hating on him for saying it. Kanye is one of the most talented musicians of his generation. If anyone can pull it off, he can. But I think maybe for the sake of his fan base, he might want to cool it a bit. HAMMER: Yes. I mean, sometimes, simple thank you is nice. But I think for Kanye West, it`s out of the question. Laura, I mean, really, when you look at Kanye and his history here, it`s almost become part of his shtick to say something off the wall whenever there`s an open mike around, and particularly in the award shows, right? SALTMAN: I don`t think it`s his shtick, though. I actually think it`s who Kanye West is. He says what`s on his mind. I fell like ever since that car accident he had in 2002, he`s always just been a little bit off, like there`s something a little wrong with him and he`ll just put it out there, things that you and I would never say, he has no problem saying. HAMMER: All right. I`m not even going to go there. I`m just going to move on. We have to talk about our favorite singer, socialite, and most recently, presidential candidate - Paris Hilton. Yes, she was right there at the American Music Awards. I`m not sure why still. But we remember that Paris was, of course, dragged into the presidential race when John McCain compared her to Barack Obama. That, of course, sparked Paris` fake but very active campaign for president. Last night, SHOWBIZ TONIGHT had to ask Paris what she thought her impact was on the historic real campaign. Watch Paris. HILTON: It was such a huge campaign and the history. And to be involved with it was fun. And you know, I had fun with it and did some funny spoof videos and I think raised a lot of awareness for young voters. And I had a lot of - you know, I just had fun with that. That`s what life`s about. HAMMER: Did you happen to notice that Paris never said it inspired her to vote or that she learned from her experience? Ben, it was really one big performance for Paris Hilton, wasn`t it? WIDDICOMBE: A.J., I have long ago surrendered to the idea that it is Paris Hilton`s world and the rest of us are just as fleas on her Chihuahua. But you know, she does have a point there. The election was fun. So I think Michelle and Barack should just have her around for sleepovers so she can make one of her videos in the Lincoln bedroom and everyone will be happy. HAMMER: Well, you know, she certainly has stuff to say about the Obamas. And particularly, as someone who knows a thing or two about style, it was very interesting to hear her give the real winners of the presidential race, the Obamas, kudos for their style. Watch what she told SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. HILTON: I think they`re both definitely style icons. They know what they`re doing. Very charismatic. They`re a beautiful couple, a beautiful family and it`s nice to have that in the White House. HAMMER: She actually can be eloquent when she speaks of what she knows. Laura, the Obamas have Paris` official style stamp of approval. Can they rest easy now? SALTMAN: Oh, wow. They just should be so happy that Paris Hilton likes what they wear because she just always has to most fabulous outfits on. She never has any fashion \"noes\" herself ever. I mean, come on. HAMMER: All right. Let`s just move right along to another story, big, new right now. Rosie O`Donnell feuding again with Barbara Walters. Now, Rosie was on the \"Today\" show this morning. She was trying to make nice after she attacked Barbara and \"The View\" last week. It all started, of course, when Rosie said she felt like she had posttraumatic stress disorder from her experience working on \"The View.\" Well, I`ve got to tell you the \"Showbiz On Call\" phone lines - they went nuclear, I tell you. You`ve got to hear this one conspiracy theory from one of our viewers. Listen to this - ANONYMOUS CALLER: This deal between Barbara Walters and Rosie O`Donnell, you all are getting played. I mean, the election is over with. Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Joy Behar have nothing else to fight about. Now, Rosie`s got the show coming up, so why not publicize each show? You`ve got to realize Barbara Walters is very smart and Rosie O`Donnell is incredibly smart. And there`s nothing better for ratings than controversy. HAMMER: All right. Well, Rosie has claimed this has nothing to do with publicity for her new variety show. Laura, are you with the caller here? Are we getting played or is it all about making noise for Rosie all the time? SALTMAN: Rosie and Kanye should do a show together because the two of them, they just can`t keep their mouths shut. They have to say what they feel. I really don`t think it has anything to do with publicity for the show. I just think that somebody asked her a question and she says exactly what she feels. And I don`t think there`s anything wrong with that. I think more people should be honest in this business. HAMMER: A lot of people are being honest with their feelings as they call on \"Showbiz On Call.\" I`m not kidding when I tell you we`ve got a ton of phone calls. We heard from Jackie in Michigan. Now, Jackie got on the phone, took the time out to call on \"Showbiz On Call\" and she thinks that although Rosie is professing her love for Barbara Walters - now, she actually said \"I love you, Barbara\" on national television - she feels it`s going to be long before all that love go sour once again. Listen - JACKIE, CALLER FROM MICHIGAN: I think that Rosie is always going to have a hatchet. It`s her mouth and it`s going to keep right on, cutting away at everybody - everybody, whoever she feels that she needs to cut up. She`s a wild hatchet lady and she just isn`t going to get rid of it. HAMMER: Yes. Wild hatchet lady. All right. Ben Widdicombe, over to you. What do you think? Is our caller, Jackie from Michigan right? Rosie is just a loose cannon. She`s going to fire away once again at Barbara or whoever it is that happens to get in her way on any particular day? WIDDICOMBE: It sounds like Jackie has her number. Maybe Rosie next feud should be with her. Listen, Rosie is fabulous. We love her. But she is just this big steamroller with a hair and makeup budget and she will roll over anyone who gets in her way. And we wouldn`t have it any other way. HAMMER: Now, what do you think of Laura`s idea that she had for this variety show? You know, Kanye West perhaps co-hosting with Rosie O`Donnell? I`m thinking Kanye - no, I`m thinking Rosie dressed as Elvis - maybe both of them, and they can just go nuts on people for the entire hour. Ben, I think - SALTMAN: The ratings would be huge. WIDDICOMBE: I think there would be blood on the studio walls if you put those two together. HAMMER: And Laura, you`d be along with that? SALTMAN: I think the ratings would be huge. Put those two together and let them say whatever they want. People would tune in for that. HAMMER: Seriously, Ben, though. Do you think once the smoke clears, we`re going to see how this variety show that Rosie is doing on Thursday does? Do you think it`s going to be a quiet time again for Rosie O`Donnell or is the momentum continuing to build and she does it on her blog almost every day now? WIDDICOMBE: I think there will be great things from Rosie on the variety special. You know, she says in a depressed economy, people want that kind of variety. The success of shows like \"Dancing With The Stars\" and \"American Idol\" show that people want that kind of soft variety entertainment. So I hope it`s a big success and she gets to see it that way. HAMMER: It will be interesting to see if you have to have controversy to the ratings one of these days. Ben Widdicombe, Laura Saltman, thanks for being here. All right. Brooke, you know, I bet our viewers have plenty to say about Paris and Kanye and we know they`re talking about Rosie. ANDERSON: Yes. We would love to hear more from them, A.J.

HAMMER: Never like to see a marriage go down the tubes. So I`m sad it didn`t work out. ANDERSON: Yes. Me, too. Tonight, for the first time, Madonna is speaking out just what is she going through just days after her split. How was she coping. Also brand new, emotional words from Michelle Williams. She`s going public with her private pain about losing Heath Ledger. That`s coming up. And also this - HAMMER (on camera): Headlines were screaming Nicole Kidman is leaving acting. She`s quitting the business. You have to set the record straight. ANDERSON: And did you see this? I bet you haven`t. Monkeys as waiters. No, they`re not going bananas. This is real. And you`ve got to see them in action. We`ve got it next. HAMMER: And now, the SHOWBIZ news ticker, more stories from the SHOWBIZ TONIGHT newsroom making news right now.
