        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says that the rectangle has a length of 15 meters and a width of 10 meters. Then, it says that we increase the length by 50% and decrease the width by 25%, and we need to find the new area of the rectangle after these changes.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what the original dimensions are. The length is 15 meters and the width is 10 meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width, so the original area would be 15 meters times 10 meters, which is 150 square meters. But yeah, that's the original area. We need to find the new area after the changes.\n\nSo, it says we increase the length by 50%. Okay, increasing the length by 50% means we're adding half of its original length to itself. So, half of 15 meters is 7.5 meters. Therefore, the new length would be 15 meters plus 7.5 meters, which is 22.5 meters.\n\nNext, we're decreasing the width by 25%. Decreasing the width by 25% means we're removing a quarter of its original width. A quarter of 10 meters is 2.5 meters. So, the new width would be 10 meters minus 2.5 meters, which is 7.5 meters.\n\nNow, to find the new area, we multiply the new length by the new width. So, that's 22.5 meters times 7.5 meters. Let me calculate that.\n\n22.5 times 7.5. Well, 20 times 7.5 is 150, and 2.5 times 7.5 is 18.75. So, adding those together, 150 plus 18.75 is 168.75 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Because originally, the area was 150 square meters, and if we're increasing the length by 50% and decreasing the width by 25%, I would expect the area to change accordingly. But let's double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I've learned that when dealing with percentages, you can also calculate the new dimensions by multiplying the original dimensions by the percentage change in decimal form.\n\nSo, for the length, increasing by 50% means multiplying by 1 plus 0.5, which is 1.5. So, new length is 15 meters times 1.5, which is 22.5 meters. That matches what I did earlier.\n\nFor the width, decreasing by 25% means multiplying by 1 minus 0.25, which is 0.75. So, new width is 10 meters times 0.75, which is 7.5 meters. Again, that matches.\n\nNow, multiplying 22.5 by 7.5 should give the new area. Let me see if there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, since area is length times width, and we're scaling the length by 1.5 and the width by 0.75, the new area should be the original area times 1.5 times 0.75.\n\nSo, original area is 150 square meters, times 1.5, which is 225, and then times 0.75, which is 168.75 square meters.\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier. So, perhaps it is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication of 22.5 and 7.5.\n\n22.5 times 7 is 157.5, and 22.5 times 0.5 is 11.25. Adding those together, 157.5 plus 11.25 is indeed 168.75 square meters.\n\nAlright, so the new area is 168.75 square meters.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using fractions could make it clearer.\n\n15 meters increased by 50% is the same as 15 meters plus half of 15 meters, which is 7.5 meters, totaling 22.5 meters.\n\n10 meters decreased by 25% is the same as 10 meters minus a quarter of 10 meters, which is 2.5 meters, totaling 7.5 meters.\n\nSo, again, 22.5 meters times 7.5 meters is 168.75 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the percentage changes together. Increasing by 50% and then decreasing by 25% is like multiplying the original area by 1.5 and then by 0.75.\n\nSo, 150 times 1.5 is 225, and 225 times 0.75 is 168.75.\n\nWait, or even better, 1.5 times 0.75 is 1.125, which is a 12.5% increase from the original area.\n\nSo, 150 square meters increased by 12.5% is indeed 168.75 square meters.\n\nLet me check that: 12.5% of 150 is 18.75, and 150 plus 18.75 is 168.75.\n\nEverything seems to confirm that the new area is 168.75 square meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{168.75} \\]"
