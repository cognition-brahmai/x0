        "content": "To find the average speed for the entire journey, we need to consider both the distance traveled and the time taken for each half of the journey.\n\nLet's denote the total distance of the journey as D miles. Therefore, each half of the journey is D/2 miles.\n\nFor the first half of the journey:\n\n- Speed: 60 mph\n\n- Distance: D/2 miles\n\n- Time: time = distance/speed = (D/2)/60 = D/(2*60) = D/120 hours\n\nFor the second half of the journey:\n\n- Speed: 40 mph\n\n- Distance: D/2 miles\n\n- Time: time = distance/speed = (D/2)/40 = D/(2*40) = D/80 hours\n\nNow, the total time for the entire journey is the sum of the times for both halves:\n\nTotal time = D/120 + D/80 hours\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 120 and 80 is 240.\n\nSo, D/120 = (2D)/240 and D/80 = (3D)/240\n\nTherefore, total time = (2D + 3D)/240 = 5D/240 = D/48 hours\n\nThe average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time:\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time = D / (D/48) = D * (48/D) = 48 mph\n\nSo, the average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
