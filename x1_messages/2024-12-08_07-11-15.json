        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a box with red balls and blue balls, and when you pick two balls at random without putting them back, the probability that both are red is 1/2. We need to find the ratio of red balls to blue balls.\n\nFirst, let's denote some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say there are R red balls and B blue balls in the box. The total number of balls then is R + B.\n\nNow, the probability of picking two red balls without replacement is given by the formula:\n\nP(both red) = (R / (R + B)) * ((R - 1) / (R + B - 1))\n\nAnd we know that this probability equals 1/2.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(R / (R + B)) * ((R - 1) / (R + B - 1)) = 1/2\n\nOur goal is to solve for the ratio R/B.\n\nHmm, this looks a bit tricky. Maybe there\u2019s a way to simplify this equation.\n\nLet\u2019s first consider that the total number of ways to pick two balls from the box is C(R + B, 2), which is (R + B)(R + B - 1)/2.\n\nThe number of ways to pick two red balls is C(R, 2), which is R(R - 1)/2.\n\nSo, the probability P is:\n\nP = [C(R, 2)] / [C(R + B, 2)] = [R(R - 1)/2] / [(R + B)(R + B - 1)/2] = [R(R - 1)] / [(R + B)(R + B - 1)]\n\nAnd this equals 1/2.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nR(R - 1) / [(R + B)(R + B - 1)] = 1/2\n\nLet\u2019s cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n2R(R - 1) = (R + B)(R + B - 1)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: 2R^2 - 2R\n\nRight side: (R + B)(R + B - 1) = R(R + B - 1) + B(R + B - 1) = R^2 + RB - R + BR + B^2 - B = R^2 + 2RB + B^2 - R - B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2R^2 - 2R = R^2 + 2RB + B^2 - R - B\n\nLet\u2019s bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n2R^2 - 2R - R^2 - 2RB - B^2 + R + B = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2R^2 - R^2) + (-2R + R) - 2RB - B^2 + B = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nR^2 - R - 2RB - B^2 + B = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there\u2019s a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s consider the ratio we\u2019re trying to find is R/B = k, where k is the ratio we\u2019re seeking.\n\nSo, R = kB\n\nSubstitute R = kB into the equation:\n\n(kB)^2 - kB - 2(kB)(B) - B^2 + B = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk^2 B^2 - kB - 2kB^2 - B^2 + B = 0\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there\u2019s a better substitution or a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s think about small numbers. Maybe there\u2019s a small number of balls that satisfy this condition.\n\nSuppose there are R red balls and B blue balls.\n\nLet\u2019s try R = 2, B = 1.\n\nTotal balls = 3.\n\nProbability of both red: (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/3, which is less than 1/2.\n\nNot enough.\n\nTry R = 3, B = 2.\n\nTotal balls = 5.\n\nProbability: (3/5)*(2/4) = (3/5)*(1/2) = 3/10, which is less than 1/2.\n\nStill too low.\n\nTry R = 4, B = 3.\n\nTotal balls = 7.\n\nProbability: (4/7)*(3/6) = (4/7)*(1/2) = 4/14 = 2/7, which is less than 1/2.\n\nStill not there.\n\nTry R = 5, B = 4.\n\nTotal balls = 9.\n\nProbability: (5/9)*(4/8) = (5/9)*(1/2) = 5/18, which is less than 1/2.\n\nHmm, still less.\n\nTry R = 6, B = 5.\n\nTotal balls = 11.\n\nProbability: (6/11)*(5/10) = (6/11)*(1/2) = 6/22 = 3/11, still less than 1/2.\n\nThis isn\u2019t working. Maybe there\u2019s no solution with small numbers, or perhaps I need to consider a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the equation:\n\nR(R - 1) / [(R + B)(R + B - 1)] = 1/2\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n2R(R - 1) = (R + B)(R + B - 1)\n\nLet\u2019s expand both sides:\n\nLeft: 2R^2 - 2R\n\nRight: (R + B)(R + B - 1) = R(R + B - 1) + B(R + B - 1) = R^2 + RB - R + BR + B^2 - B = R^2 + 2RB + B^2 - R - B\n\nSet equal:\n\n2R^2 - 2R = R^2 + 2RB + B^2 - R - B\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n2R^2 - 2R - R^2 - 2RB - B^2 + R + B = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nR^2 - R - 2RB - B^2 + B = 0\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe I can rearrange terms:\n\nR^2 - 2RB - B^2 - R + B = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I can try to solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nLet\u2019s try solving for R in terms of B.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of R:\n\nR^2 - (2B + 1)R - (B^2 - B) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nR = [ (2B + 1) \u00b1 sqrt( (2B + 1)^2 + 4(B^2 - B) ) ] / 2\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\nD = (2B + 1)^2 + 4(B^2 - B) = 4B^2 + 4B + 1 + 4B^2 - 4B = 8B^2 + 1\n\nSo, R = [ (2B + 1) \u00b1 sqrt(8B^2 + 1) ] / 2\n\nThis is interesting. For R to be an integer, sqrt(8B^2 + 1) must be an integer as well.\n\nLet\u2019s set sqrt(8B^2 + 1) = k, where k is an integer.\n\nThen, k^2 = 8B^2 + 1\n\nThis is a Diophantine equation: k^2 - 8B^2 = 1\n\nThis is a form of Pell's equation, which has infinite solutions.\n\nThe fundamental solution to x^2 - 8y^2 = 1 is (x, y) = (3, 1).\n\nThen, subsequent solutions can be found using the recurrence relations.\n\nBut maybe there are smaller solutions. Let\u2019s check for small values of B.\n\nIf B = 1:\n\nK^2 = 8(1)^2 + 1 = 9, so K = 3\n\nThen, R = [ (2*1 + 1) \u00b1 3 ] / 2\n\nSo, R = [3 \u00b1 3]/2\n\nR = (3 + 3)/2 = 3, or (3 - 3)/2 = 0\n\nR = 3 or 0\n\nR = 0 doesn\u2019t make sense in this context, so R = 3\n\nSo, when B = 1, R = 3\n\nLet\u2019s check the probability:\n\nP = (3/4)*(2/3) = (3/4)*(2/3) = 1/2\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAnother solution:\n\nNext, B = 6\n\nK^2 = 8*(6)^2 + 1 = 289, K = 17\n\nR = [2*6 + 1 \u00b1 17]/2 = [12 + 1 \u00b1 17]/2\n\nR = [13 + 17]/2 = 30/2 = 15, or [13 - 17]/2 = -4/2 = -2 (not valid)\n\nSo, R = 15\n\nCheck the probability:\n\nP = (15/21)*(14/20) = (15/21)*(7/10) = (5/7)*(7/10) = 5/10 = 1/2\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnother solution:\n\nB = 35\n\nK^2 = 8*(35)^2 + 1 = 8*1225 + 1 = 9800 + 1 = 9801, K = 99\n\nR = [2*35 + 1 \u00b1 99]/2 = [70 + 1 \u00b1 99]/2\n\nR = [71 + 99]/2 = 170/2 = 85, or [71 - 99]/2 = -28/2 = -14 (invalid)\n\nSo, R = 85\n\nCheck probability:\n\nP = (85/120)*(84/119) = (85/120)*(84/119) = (17/24)*(12/17) = 12/24 = 1/2\n\nAgain, it matches.\n\nSo, it seems there are infinite solutions following this pattern.\n\nBut the problem asks for the ratio R/B.\n\nFrom the first solution, B = 1, R = 3, so R/B = 3/1 = 3\n\nNext, B = 6, R = 15, R/B = 15/6 = 5/2\n\nNext, B = 35, R = 85, R/B = 85/35 = 17/7\n\nHmm, the ratios are different each time. So, there isn\u2019t a single ratio; it changes with different values of B.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to express the ratio in terms of the solutions.\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n\nFirst solution: B = 1, R = 3, ratio R/B = 3/1 = 3\n\nSecond: B = 6, R = 15, ratio = 15/6 = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nThird: B = 35, R = 85, ratio = 85/35 = 17/7 \u2248 2.4286\n\nIt seems like the ratio is decreasing slightly each time.\n\nIs there a general formula for R/B?\n\nFrom earlier, R = [ (2B + 1) + sqrt(8B^2 + 1) ] / 2\n\nSince sqrt(8B^2 + 1) is approximately sqrt(8)B for large B, which is roughly 2*sqrt(2)*B\n\nBut that\u2019s not precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\u2019s a relationship between consecutive B\u2019s and R\u2019s.\n\nLooking at the sequence of B: 1, 6, 35, ...\n\nAnd R: 3, 15, 85, ...\n\nThese seem to follow a pattern where each term is multiplied by a certain factor plus something.\n\nFor B: 1, 6, 35, ...\n\n6 = 1*6 + 0\n\n35 = 6*5 + 5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recursive relations exist.\n\nFrom the Pell equation, solutions can be generated recursively.\n\nThe fundamental solution is (K, B) = (3,1)\n\nNext solution is (k + 8B, 3B + K)\n\nWait, for Pell equations of the form K^2 - 8B^2 = 1, the solutions can be generated using the fundamental solution.\n\nThe fundamental solution is (K, B) = (3,1)\n\nNext solution: (3*3 + 8*1, 3*1 + 3) = (9 + 8, 3 + 3) = (17, 6)\n\nWait, but earlier I had K=17 and B=6, which matches.\n\nNext would be (3*17 + 8*6, 3*6 + 17) = (51 + 48, 18 + 17) = (99, 35)\n\nWhich again matches.\n\nSo, the general solution can be generated this way.\n\nNow, for the ratio R/B.\n\nFrom the general solution, R = [2B + 1 + sqrt(8B^2 + 1)] / 2\n\nSo, R/B = [2B + 1 + sqrt(8B^2 + 1)] / (2B)\n\n= [2B/B + 1/B + sqrt(8B^2 + 1)/B] / 2\n\n= [2 + 1/B + sqrt(8 + 1/B^2)] / 2\n\nAs B becomes large, 1/B and 1/B^2 approach 0, so:\n\nR/B \u2248 [2 + sqrt(8)] / 2 = [2 + 2*sqrt(2)] / 2 = 1 + sqrt(2)\n\nSo, asymptotically, the ratio R/B approaches 1 + sqrt(2).\n\nCalculating 1 + sqrt(2):\n\nsqrt(2) \u2248 1.4142, so 1 + 1.4142 \u2248 2.4142\n\nLooking back at the earlier ratios:\n\n3, 2.5, 17/7 \u2248 2.4286, which is approaching 2.4142.\n\nSo, the ratio approaches 1 + sqrt(2).\n\nBut the problem likely expects a exact value rather than an approximation.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red balls to blue balls is 1 + sqrt(2).\n\nHowever, ratios are typically expressed as fractions, but since sqrt(2) is irrational, the ratio is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expressing it as R/B = (1 + sqrt(2))\n\nBut to confirm, let\u2019s consider the general solution.\n\nFrom earlier, R = [2B + 1 + sqrt(8B^2 + 1)] / 2\n\nSo, R/B = [2B/B + 1/B + sqrt(8B^2 + 1)/B] / 2\n\n= [2 + 1/B + sqrt(8 + 1/B^2)] / 2\n\nAs B approaches infinity, R/B approaches [2 + sqrt(8)] / 2 = [2 + 2*sqrt(2)] / 2 = 1 + sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of red balls to blue balls approaches 1 + sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the answer is that the ratio of red balls to blue balls is 1 + sqrt(2).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 + \\sqrt{2}} \\]"
