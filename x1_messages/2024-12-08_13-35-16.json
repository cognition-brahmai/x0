        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if it takes eight men ten hours to build a wall, how long would it take four men to build the same wall? Hmm, this seems like a straightforward work rate problem, but I want to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of men and the time it takes to build the wall. Intuitively, if you have fewer men, it should take longer to build the wall, and vice versa. So, there's an inverse relationship between the number of men and the time required.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. If eight men take ten hours, then the total amount of work done is, in some sense, \"eight men times ten hours.\" So, the work required to build the wall is 8 men * 10 hours = 80 man-hours.\n\nNow, if I have four men, I need to find out how many hours it will take for them to complete the same 80 man-hours of work. Let's let \\( h \\) be the number of hours required for four men to build the wall. Then, the total work done by four men in \\( h \\) hours is 4 men * \\( h \\) hours = 4h man-hours.\n\nSince the total work required is 80 man-hours, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 4h = 80 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{80}{4} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, it would take four men 20 hours to build the same wall.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Another way to think about it is to find the work rate per man. If eight men take ten hours, then the combined work rate of eight men is one wall per ten hours.\n\nSo, the work rate of eight men is:\n\n\\[ \\text{work rate} = \\frac{1 \\text{ wall}}{10 \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\nTherefore, the work rate per man is:\n\n\\[ \\text{work rate per man} = \\frac{1 \\text{ wall}}{8 \\text{ men} \\times 10 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{1}{80} \\text{ walls per hour per man} \\]\n\nNow, if I have four men, their combined work rate is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ men} \\times \\frac{1}{80} \\text{ walls per hour per man} = \\frac{4}{80} = \\frac{1}{20} \\text{ walls per hour} \\]\n\nSo, to build one wall, the time required is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{1 \\text{ wall}}{\\frac{1}{20} \\text{ walls per hour}} = 20 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. But just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf eight men take ten hours, then four men, being half the number of men, should take twice as long, right? Because half the workforce should mean twice the time.\n\nSo, half of eight is four, and twice ten hours is twenty hours. That again gives me 20 hours.\n\nAlright, all three methods\u2014man-hour calculation, work rate per man, and proportional reasoning\u2014lead me to the same conclusion. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 20 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
