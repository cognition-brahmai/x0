        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a TypeScript class for a \"Vehicle\" with the specified properties and methods.\n\nFirst, we need to define the class with the properties: make, model, year, and color. Then, we'll add methods to display the vehicle's information and to change its color.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```typescript\nclass Vehicle {\n    make: string;\n    model: string;\n    year: number;\n    color: string;\n\n    constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number, color: string) {\n        this.make = make;\n        this.model = model;\n        this.year = year;\n        this.color = color;\n    }\n\n    displayInfo(): void {\n        console.log(`Make: ${this.make}`);\n        console.log(`Model: ${this.model}`);\n        console.log(`Year: ${this.year}`);\n        console.log(`Color: ${this.color}`);\n    }\n\n    changeColor(newColor: string): void {\n        this.color = newColor;\n        console.log(`Color changed to ${newColor}`);\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst myCar = new Vehicle(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2022, \"Blue\");\nmyCar.displayInfo();\nmyCar.changeColor(\"Red\");\nmyCar.displayInfo();\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a class called `Vehicle` with properties for make, model, year, and color.\n\n- The constructor initializes these properties when a new vehicle object is created.\n\n- The `displayInfo` method prints out the vehicle's information to the console.\n\n- The `changeColor` method allows changing the vehicle's color and confirms the change.\n\nYou can create instances of the `Vehicle` class and use these methods to manage and display vehicle data.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
