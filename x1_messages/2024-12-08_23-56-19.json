        "content": "So the city has 50,000 cars right now, and the number of cars grows by 8% each year. I need to find out how many cars there will be after 5 years. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving exponential growth.\n\nI remember that exponential growth can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ A = P(1 + r)^t \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount after time \\( t \\),\n\n- \\( P \\) is the initial amount,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate, and\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, \\( P \\) is 50,000 cars, \\( r \\) is 8% or 0.08, and \\( t \\) is 5 years. Plugging these values into the formula should give me the answer.\n\nSo, let's plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times (1 + 0.08)^5 \\]\n\nFirst, I need to calculate \\( 1 + 0.08 \\), which is \\( 1.08 \\). Then raise that to the power of 5.\n\nI think \\( 1.08^5 \\) is approximately 1.4693. I might want to double-check that.\n\nLet me calculate \\( 1.08^5 \\) step by step:\n\n- \\( 1.08^1 = 1.08 \\)\n\n- \\( 1.08^2 = 1.08 \\times 1.08 = 1.1664 \\)\n\n- \\( 1.08^3 = 1.1664 \\times 1.08 = 1.259712 \\)\n\n- \\( 1.08^4 = 1.259712 \\times 1.08 = 1.35712864 \\)\n\n- \\( 1.08^5 = 1.35712864 \\times 1.08 = 1.4693280768 \\)\n\nSo, approximately 1.4693 is close enough.\n\nNow, multiply that by the initial amount:\n\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times 1.4693 = 73,465 \\]\n\nSo, after 5 years, there will be approximately 73,465 cars in the city.\n\nBut I should check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using compound interest formula, since it's similar.\n\nThe compound interest formula is:\n\n\\[ A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt} \\]\n\nBut in this case, since the growth is annual, \\( n \\) would be 1, so it's the same as the exponential growth formula I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of cars year by year.\n\nLet's try that to verify.\n\nStarting with 50,000 cars.\n\nAfter the first year:\n\n\\[ 50,000 + 0.08 \\times 50,000 = 50,000 \\times 1.08 = 54,000 \\]\n\nAfter the second year:\n\n\\[ 54,000 \\times 1.08 = 58,320 \\]\n\nAfter the third year:\n\n\\[ 58,320 \\times 1.08 = 62,985.6 \\]\n\nAfter the fourth year:\n\n\\[ 62,985.6 \\times 1.08 = 67,939.168 \\]\n\nAfter the fifth year:\n\n\\[ 67,939.168 \\times 1.08 = 73,465.79808 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, again approximately 73,466 cars.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation using the exponential growth formula.\n\nSo, the answer should be around 73,466 cars after 5 years.\n\nBut to be precise, I should consider more decimal places.\n\nLet me use the exponential growth formula again with more precision.\n\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times (1.08)^5 \\]\n\nI previously calculated \\( 1.08^5 = 1.4693280768 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A = 50,000 \\times 1.4693280768 = 73,466.40384 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives 73,466 cars.\n\nTherefore, after 5 years, there will be approximately 73,466 cars in the city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{73466} \\]"
