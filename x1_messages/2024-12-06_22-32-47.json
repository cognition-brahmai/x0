        "content": "Alright, I'm going to design a C# class for a bank account that can handle deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. I need to make sure that it handles errors properly, like when someone tries to withdraw more money than they have or inputs invalid amounts.\n\nFirst, I'll start by creating the class structure. I'll call it \"BankAccount.\" It should have a private field to store the current balance. Maybe something like this:\n\n```csharp\npublic class BankAccount\n{\n    private decimal balance;\n\n    public BankAccount()\n    {\n        balance = 0;\n    }\n\n    public void Deposit(decimal amount)\n    {\n        // Add the amount to the balance\n    }\n\n    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)\n    {\n        // Subtract the amount from the balance if sufficient funds\n    }\n\n    public decimal CheckBalance()\n    {\n        // Return the current balance\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, I need to implement the methods with proper error handling.\n\nFor the Deposit method, I need to make sure that the amount being deposited is positive. If someone tries to deposit a negative amount, that doesn't make sense, so I should probably throw an exception in that case.\n\nSimilarly, for the Withdraw method, I need to check two things: first, that the amount to withdraw is positive, and second, that the account has sufficient funds to cover the withdrawal. If either of these checks fails, I should throw an exception.\n\nFor the CheckBalance method, it's straightforward; it just returns the current balance.\n\nLet me think about the exceptions. In C#, it's common to use ArgumentException or ArgumentOutOfRangeException for invalid input values, and maybe a custom exception for insufficient funds.\n\nI could create a custom exception called InsufficientFundsException. That way, the user of the class knows exactly what went wrong.\n\nSo, first, I'll define the custom exception:\n\n```csharp\npublic class InsufficientFundsException : Exception\n{\n    public InsufficientFundsException(string message) : base(message)\n    {\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, I'll implement the Deposit method with validation:\n\n```csharp\npublic void Deposit(decimal amount)\n{\n    if (amount <= 0)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n    }\n    balance += amount;\n}\n```\n\nFor the Withdraw method, I need to check both the amount and the balance:\n\n```csharp\npublic void Withdraw(decimal amount)\n{\n    if (amount <= 0)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\");\n    }\n    if (balance < amount)\n    {\n        throw new InsufficientFundsException(\"Insufficient funds to complete the withdrawal.\");\n    }\n    balance -= amount;\n}\n```\n\nAnd the CheckBalance method is simple:\n\n```csharp\npublic decimal CheckBalance()\n{\n    return balance;\n}\n```\n\nNow, to make sure this class works as expected, I need to write some unit tests. I'll use the NUnit testing framework for this.\n\nFirst, I need to install NUnit and NUnit3TestAdapter via NuGet.\n\nThen, I'll create a test class for BankAccount.\n\nLet me outline the tests I want to write:\n\n1. Test depositing a positive amount increases the balance correctly.\n\n2. Test withdrawing a positive amount decreases the balance correctly.\n\n3. Test checking the balance returns the correct amount.\n\n4. Test depositing a negative amount throws an ArgumentException.\n\n5. Test withdrawing a negative amount throws an ArgumentException.\n\n6. Test withdrawing an amount greater than the balance throws an InsufficientFundsException.\n\nI'll write each test accordingly.\n\nFirst, the test for depositing a positive amount:\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void Deposit_PositiveAmount_IncreasesBalance()\n{\n    // Arrange\n    var account = new BankAccount();\n    decimal initialBalance = account.CheckBalance();\n    decimal depositAmount = 100;\n\n    // Act\n    account.Deposit(depositAmount);\n\n    // Assert\n    decimal newBalance = account.CheckBalance();\n    Assert.AreEqual(initialBalance + depositAmount, newBalance);\n}\n```\n\nNext, the test for withdrawing a positive amount:\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void Withdraw_PositiveAmount_DecreasesBalance()\n{\n    // Arrange\n    var account = new BankAccount();\n    account.Deposit(200);\n    decimal initialBalance = account.CheckBalance();\n    decimal withdrawalAmount = 100;\n\n    // Act\n    account.Withdraw(withdrawalAmount);\n\n    // Assert\n    decimal newBalance = account.CheckBalance();\n    Assert.AreEqual(initialBalance - withdrawalAmount, newBalance);\n}\n```\n\nThen, the test for checking the balance:\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void CheckBalance_ReturnsCorrectBalance()\n{\n    // Arrange\n    var account = new BankAccount();\n    account.Deposit(150);\n\n    // Act\n    decimal balance = account.CheckBalance();\n\n    // Assert\n    Assert.AreEqual(150, balance);\n}\n```\n\nNow, the test for depositing a negative amount:\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void Deposit_NegativeAmount_ThrowsArgumentException()\n{\n    // Arrange\n    var account = new BankAccount();\n    decimal negativeAmount = -50;\n\n    // Act & Assert\n    Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => account.Deposit(negativeAmount));\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, the test for withdrawing a negative amount:\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void Withdraw_NegativeAmount_ThrowsArgumentException()\n{\n    // Arrange\n    var account = new BankAccount();\n    account.Deposit(100);\n    decimal negativeAmount = -50;\n\n    // Act & Assert\n    Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => account.Withdraw(negativeAmount));\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the test for withdrawing more than the balance:\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void Withdraw_ExceedsBalance_ThrowsInsufficientFundsException()\n{\n    // Arrange\n    var account = new BankAccount();\n    account.Deposit(100);\n    decimal withdrawalAmount = 150;\n\n    // Act & Assert\n    Assert.Throws<InsufficientFundsException>(() => account.Withdraw(withdrawalAmount));\n}\n```\n\nI think these tests cover the basic functionality and error handling of the BankAccount class.\n\nLet me think if there are any other edge cases I should consider.\n\nWhat if someone tries to withdraw exactly the balance? Should that be allowed?\n\nYes, it should be allowed. The balance should be able to go down to zero.\n\nAlso, what if someone tries to deposit zero? Should that throw an exception or just do nothing?\n\nCurrently, my Deposit method checks if the amount is less than or equal to zero, and throws an exception. So, depositing zero would throw an exception.\n\nMaybe it's better to allow zero deposits and just do nothing, or perhaps throw an exception to prevent unnecessary operations.\n\nI'll keep it as is for now, throwing an exception for non-positive amounts.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the precision of decimal amounts, especially with floating-point arithmetic. But since I'm using decimal in C#, which is suitable for financial calculations, that should be fine.\n\nAlso, I might want to make the BankAccount class a bit more feature-rich later on, like adding overdraw limits or handling multiple currencies, but for now, this basic implementation should suffice.\n\nI should also consider making the BankAccount class thread-safe if it's going to be used in a multi-threaded environment, but that's a bit advanced for this initial implementation.\n\nFor now, I'll stick with the current design and make sure the unit tests pass.\n\nLet me try running these tests to verify.\n\nAssuming all tests pass, I can consider this a successful implementation of a basic bank account class in C#.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to design a `BankAccount` class in C# that can handle depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance with appropriate error handling. Additionally, we will create unit tests to verify the functionality of this class.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Class Design:**\n   - Use a private field to store the balance.\n   - Implement methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n   - Include error handling for invalid inputs and insufficient funds.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Throw `ArgumentException` for invalid (non-positive) amounts in deposit and withdraw operations.\n   - Throw a custom `InsufficientFundsException` when a withdrawal exceeds the available balance.\n\n3. **Unit Testing:**\n   - Use NUnit to write tests for various scenarios including valid operations and error conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n#### BankAccount Class\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class BankAccount\n{\n    private decimal balance;\n\n    public BankAccount()\n    {\n        balance = 0;\n    }\n\n    public void Deposit(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount <= 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n        }\n        balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount <= 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\");\n        }\n        if (balance < amount)\n        {\n            throw new InsufficientFundsException(\"Insufficient funds to complete the withdrawal.\");\n        }\n        balance -= amount;\n    }\n\n    public decimal CheckBalance()\n    {\n        return balance;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class InsufficientFundsException : Exception\n{\n    public InsufficientFundsException(string message) : base(message)\n    {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Unit Tests using NUnit\n\nMake sure to install NUnit and NUnit3TestAdapter via NuGet.\n\n```csharp\nusing NUnit.Framework;\nusing System;\n\n[TestFixture]\npublic class BankAccountTests\n{\n    [Test]\n    public void Deposit_PositiveAmount_IncreasesBalance()\n    {\n        // Arrange\n        var account = new BankAccount();\n        decimal initialBalance = account.CheckBalance();\n        decimal depositAmount = 100;\n\n        // Act\n        account.Deposit(depositAmount);\n\n        // Assert\n        decimal newBalance = account.CheckBalance();\n        Assert.AreEqual(initialBalance + depositAmount, newBalance);\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Withdraw_PositiveAmount_DecreasesBalance()\n    {\n        // Arrange\n        var account = new BankAccount();\n        account.Deposit(200);\n        decimal initialBalance = account.CheckBalance();\n        decimal withdrawalAmount = 100;\n\n        // Act\n        account.Withdraw(withdrawalAmount);\n\n        // Assert\n        decimal newBalance = account.CheckBalance();\n        Assert.AreEqual(initialBalance - withdrawalAmount, newBalance);\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void CheckBalance_ReturnsCorrectBalance()\n    {\n        // Arrange\n        var account = new BankAccount();\n        account.Deposit(150);\n\n        // Act\n        decimal balance = account.CheckBalance();\n\n        // Assert\n        Assert.AreEqual(150, balance);\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Deposit_NegativeAmount_ThrowsArgumentException()\n    {\n        // Arrange\n        var account = new BankAccount();\n        decimal negativeAmount = -50;\n\n        // Act & Assert\n        Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => account.Deposit(negativeAmount));\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Withdraw_NegativeAmount_ThrowsArgumentException()\n    {\n        // Arrange\n        var account = new BankAccount();\n        account.Deposit(100);\n        decimal negativeAmount = -50;\n\n        // Act & Assert\n        Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => account.Withdraw(negativeAmount));\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Withdraw_ExceedsBalance_ThrowsInsufficientFundsException()\n    {\n        // Arrange\n        var account = new BankAccount();\n        account.Deposit(100);\n        decimal withdrawalAmount = 150;\n\n        // Act & Assert\n        Assert.Throws<InsufficientFundsException>(() => account.Withdraw(withdrawalAmount));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **BankAccount Class:**\n  - Initializes with a zero balance.\n  - Deposits and withdrawals are allowed only for positive amounts.\n  - Withdrawals are permitted only if sufficient funds are available; otherwise, an `InsufficientFundsException` is thrown.\n\n- **Unit Tests:**\n  - Test depositing and withdrawing positive amounts.\n  - Verify the correctness of the balance check.\n  - Ensure that negative amounts for deposits and withdrawals throw `ArgumentException`.\n  - Confirm that withdrawing more than the balance throws `InsufficientFundsException`.\n\nThis design ensures that the `BankAccount` class behaves as expected and handles errors gracefully, backed by comprehensive unit tests."
