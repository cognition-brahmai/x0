        "content": "I think the literary device you're referring to is called \"free indirect discourse\" or \"limited omniscience.\" In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen often presents the thoughts and perceptions of her characters in a way that blends their voices with her own narrative style. This can create situations where the reader knows more than a particular character, leading to irony or suspense. For example, the reader might be aware of certain truths about a character's intentions or circumstances that Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist, is not yet privy to. This technique allows Austen to explore themes of perception, prejudice, and the limitations of individual viewpoints."
