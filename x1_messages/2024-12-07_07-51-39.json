        "content": "In classical mechanics, the concept of kinetic energy is derived from the work-energy theorem. This theorem states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. This is a fundamental principle that governs the motion of objects. In the context of this principle, if a force is applied to an object but it does not move, the work done on the object is zero, regardless of the magnitude of the applied force. What does this imply about the relationship between work and kinetic energy?\nA. Work is always equal to kinetic energy\nB. Work is independent of kinetic energy\nC. Work is proportional to the square of kinetic energy\nD. Work is only converted to kinetic energy when it results in motion\nE. None of the above"
