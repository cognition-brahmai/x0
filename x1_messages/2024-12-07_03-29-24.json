        "content": "Greek mythology has had a profound influence on modern culture, permeating various aspects such as literature, film, music, and even technology. Here are five examples that illustrate this enduring impact:\n\n1. **Literature:**\n   - **\"The Lightning Thief\" by Rick Riordan:** This bestselling book series, part of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians franchise, reimagines Greek mythology for a contemporary audience. The stories follow Percy Jackson, a teenager who discovers he is a demigod, son of Poseidon, and embarks on adventures involving various Greek gods and monsters. The series has not only introduced younger generations to Greek myths but also inspired a love for classical literature.\n\n2. **Film:**\n   - **\"Clash of the Titans\" (2010):** This action-adventure film is a reboot of the 1981 version and features a retelling of the Perseus myth. It incorporates many elements from Greek mythology, including gods like Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon, as well as creatures such as the Kraken and the Gorgons. The film's success demonstrates the\u6301\u7eed fascination with these ancient stories in modern cinema.\n\n3. **Music:**\n   - **\"Hotel California\" by The Eagles:** While not directly about Greek mythology, the song's lyrics contain references to Greek figures and concepts. For example, the line \"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\" has been interpreted by some as a reference to the myth of Tantalus, who was condemned to eternal punishment in the underworld. Additionally, the song's themes of temptation and entrapment echo Greek tragic motifs.\n\n4. **Technology:**\n   - **Project Athena:** In the realm of technology, projects and products often draw names from Greek mythology to evoke ideas of wisdom and power. For instance, Project Athena was an initiative by MIT and Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1980s aimed at developing a new generation of workstations. The name references Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and warfare, symbolizing the project's ambitious goals in computing.\n\n5. **Art and Architecture:**\n   - **The Statue of Zeus at Olympia:** Although the original statue is lost, its influence can be seen in various modern artworks and architectural designs. For example, the seated pose of many presidential figures in American sculpture is inspired by descriptions of Phidias's statue of Zeus. Moreover, the use of classical motifs in government buildings, such as the U.S. Supreme Court building, reflects the enduring appeal of Greek architectural styles rooted in mythology.\n\nThese examples underscore how Greek mythology continues to inspire and influence modern culture, serving as a rich source of narrative, symbolism, and artistic inspiration across diverse mediums."
