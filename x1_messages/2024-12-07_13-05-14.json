        "content": "Let's see. The school needs pencils for 480 students, and each student gets 5 pencils. So first, I need to find out the total number of pencils required.\n\nTotal pencils needed = number of students \u00d7 pencils per student\n\nSo, that's 480 students \u00d7 5 pencils = 2400 pencils.\n\nNow, the pencils are sold in packs of 12. To find out how many packs are needed, I should divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per pack.\n\nNumber of packs = total pencils needed \u00f7 pencils per pack\n\nThat's 2400 pencils \u00f7 12 pencils per pack = 200 packs.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's any remainder when dividing 2400 by 12. If there is a remainder, the school would need to buy an extra pack to cover the additional pencils needed.\n\nLet me do the division: 2400 \u00f7 12 = 200. No remainder.\n\nSo, the school needs to purchase 200 packs of pencils.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, total pencils needed: 480 students \u00d7 5 pencils = 2400 pencils. That seems correct.\n\nSecond, number of packs: 2400 \u00f7 12 = 200 packs. No remainder, so no extra pack is needed.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of multiplication. If each pack has 12 pencils, then 200 packs would have 200 \u00d7 12 = 2400 pencils, which matches the total needed.\n\nTherefore, the school should purchase 200 packs of pencils.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
