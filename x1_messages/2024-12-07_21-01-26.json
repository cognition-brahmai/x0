        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a person who saves 15% of their monthly income and spends the rest on living expenses. Their monthly income is $4,000. We need to find out how much they save in a year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much they save each month. Since they save 15% of their monthly income, I can calculate that by taking 15% of $4,000.\n\nTo calculate 15% of $4,000, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 15% is the same as 0.15. So, I multiply $4,000 by 0.15.\n\n$4,000 * 0.15 = $600\n\nSo, they save $600 each month.\n\nNow, to find out how much they save in a year, I need to multiply their monthly savings by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year.\n\n$600 * 12 = $7,200\n\nTherefore, they save $7,200 in a year.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the monthly savings:\n\n15% of $4,000 is $600. That seems correct.\n\nThen, multiplying $600 by 12 months gives $7,200. That also seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently. If they save 15% each month, over a year they would save 15% * 12 months. But 15% * 12 is 180%, which doesn't make sense because you can't save more than 100% of your income. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nActually, 15% per month over 12 months is indeed 15% * 12 = 180%, but that's the total percentage of their annual income that they save. Since their monthly income is $4,000, their annual income would be $4,000 * 12 = $48,000. So, 180% of $48,000 would be $48,000 * 1.8 = $86,400, which is clearly not correct because that's more than their annual income.\n\nWait, I must have messed up somewhere. Let me re-examine this.\n\nActually, the correct way is the first method I used: calculate monthly savings and then multiply by 12 to get annual savings.\n\nSo, monthly savings: $4,000 * 0.15 = $600\n\nAnnual savings: $600 * 12 = $7,200\n\nAlternatively, since 15% per month over 12 months is indeed 180% of their monthly income, but that doesn't directly translate to their annual savings because their annual income is 12 times their monthly income.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of annual income.\n\nTheir annual income is $4,000 * 12 = $48,000\n\nIf they save 15% each month, then over the course of a year, they save 15% * 12 = 180% of their monthly income, but that doesn't directly give the annual savings.\n\nAlternatively, since they save 15% of each monthly income, the total savings over the year would be 15% of their annual income.\n\nWait, that might be the confusion. Let's see:\n\n15% of annual income: $48,000 * 0.15 = $7,200\n\nWhich matches the first calculation.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result: $7,200 annual savings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $7,200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7200} \\]"
