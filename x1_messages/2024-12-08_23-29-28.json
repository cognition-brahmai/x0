        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, and I need to find the probability that if I draw two balls without replacing the first one, both of them will be red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing two red balls in a row without replacement.\n\nSo, starting with the first draw, what's the probability that I pick a red ball? Well, there are 5 red balls and a total of 5 + 7 = 12 balls in the bag. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball first is 5/12.\n\nNow, since I'm not replacing the first ball, the total number of balls left in the bag is 11, and the number of red balls left is 4 (since I already took one red ball out). So, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 4/11.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together (both draws being red), I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event. So, it should be (5/12) * (4/11).\n\nLet me calculate that: (5/12) * (4/11) = (5*4)/(12*11) = 20/132. I can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives me 5/33.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 5/33.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use combinations. The total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 12 is C(12,2), which is 12 choose 2, and the number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5,2).\n\nSo, the probability is C(5,2)/C(12,2).\n\nCalculating C(5,2) = (5*4)/2 = 10, and C(12,2) = (12*11)/2 = 66.\n\nSo, 10/66 simplifies to 5/33, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGreat, so I'm confident now that the probability is indeed 5/33.\n\nJust to make sure I understand this concept fully, let's consider what would happen if I were to draw with replacement.\n\nIf I replace the first ball back into the bag before drawing the second one, then the total number of balls remains 12 for both draws, and the probability of drawing a red ball each time is 5/12.\n\nSo, the probability of both draws being red with replacement would be (5/12) * (5/12) = 25/144.\n\nComparing that to the without replacement scenario, which is 5/33, I can see that 5/33 is approximately 0.1515, and 25/144 is approximately 0.1736. So, with replacement, the probability is slightly higher because the conditions don't change between draws.\n\nThis makes sense because when I don't replace the first ball, there's one less ball in the bag for the second draw, affecting the probabilities.\n\nAlright, I think I've got a good grasp on this problem now. If there's anything else related to probability or combinations that I should consider or any common mistakes to avoid, I should note that.\n\nFor example, a common mistake might be to assume that the probability remains the same for the second draw without replacement, which it doesn't, as the total number of balls and the number of red balls both decrease by one.\n\nAnother thing to remember is that when dealing with without replacement scenarios, the events are dependent, meaning the outcome of the first draw affects the second draw, whereas with replacement, they are independent events.\n\nIn summary, for this specific problem, the probability of drawing two red balls without replacement is 5/33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]"
