Learn about the different types of teeth and how they work together to prepare your meal for the journey ahead.\n\n- **Descend into the Esophagus:** Feel the sensation of peristalsis as we slide down the esophagus, guided by the involuntary muscles that propel food towards the stomach. Discover the science behind heartburn and how the lower esophageal sphincter protects your esophagus from stomach acid.\n\n- **Explore the Powerful Stomach:** Arrive at the stomach, a churning factory where hydrochloric acid and enzymes break down food into a semi-liquid substance called chyme. Witness the amazing flexibility of this organ as it expands to accommodate large meals and contracts to aid in digestion.\n\n- **Navigate the Small Intestine:** Journey through the winding passages of the small intestine, where the majority of nutrient absorption takes place.

Observe the formation of feces and the vital role of gut bacteria in maintaining overall health.\n\n- **Reach the Final Destination:** Conclude your journey at the rectum and anus, where waste is stored and eventually expelled from the body.
