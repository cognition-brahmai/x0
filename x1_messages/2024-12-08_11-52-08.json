        "content": "So, there are these three friends, Mary, Peter, and Susan, and they're at the zoo looking at the penguin exhibit. They see 12 penguins swimming around, which must be pretty cool! Then, a zookeeper comes along and adds four more penguins to the enclosure but takes away two for a routine checkup. So, let's see, starting with 12 penguins, add four, that makes 16, and then take away two, so that leaves 14 penguins.\n\nBut wait, while all this is happening, another visitor drops their hat into the enclosure, causing a commotion. I wonder how that affects the penguins' behavior, but in terms of numbers, it probably doesn't change the count unless maybe a penguin decides to play with the hat or something, but I don't think that would add or remove any penguins.\n\nSo, back to the friends. They probably saw all this happen and are trying to figure out how many penguins are left in the exhibit. Mary might be good at math, so she quickly does the calculation in her head: 12 plus 4 is 16, minus 2 is 14. So, she thinks there are 14 penguins now.\n\nPeter, on the other hand, might be a bit confused. He saw 12 penguins, then four more were added, so that's 16, but then two were taken away. Wait, but the hat was dropped, maybe that changes things? Maybe he thinks some penguins are hiding or something because of the commotion. So, he might not be sure and think there are still 12 penguins, ignoring the additions and subtractions.\n\nSusan could be observant and paying close attention. She sees the four new penguins added and the two taken away. She might even try to count them to make sure. So, she starts counting: one, two, three, up to 14, and confirms that yes, there are now 14 penguins in the exhibit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they all discuss it together. Mary says 14, Peter is unsure, and Susan confirms by counting. So, in the end, they agree that there are 14 penguins in the exhibit now.\n\nBut, thinking deeper, maybe the commotion caused by the dropped hat makes it hard to count accurately. Some penguins might be hiding or swimming away, so they might not get an exact count. In that case, they might estimate that there are about 14 penguins, but they're not completely sure because of the disturbance.\n\nAlso, it's possible that the zookeeper only temporarily added four penguins and took two away, but perhaps those two are being checked and will be returned later. If that's the case, then the friends might think that eventually, there will be 16 penguins once the two return from checkup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two penguins that were taken away are being moved to another zoo or something, so they're permanently removed. In that case, the exhibit now has 14 penguins.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems like the two penguins were just taken away for a routine checkup, implying they will be returned later. So, perhaps the friends assume that the exhibit still has the original 12 penguins plus the four added, making 16, but two are temporarily absent.\n\nWait, but the zookeeper added four and took away two, so net gain is plus two, from the original 12, making 14. But if the two taken away are temporarily absent, and will return, then perhaps the exhibit still has 12 penguins plus four added, making 16, minus two that are away, so effectively 14, but eventually 16.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the friends don't think too much about it and just go with the number they see, which is 14, assuming that the two taken away are temporarily absent and will be back later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they ask a zoo staff member about the number of penguins in the exhibit. The staff member could clarify that there are currently 14 penguins in the exhibit, with two being checked and will return soon.\n\nOr, maybe they look for information on a sign near the enclosure that lists the number of penguins. But if the sign is updated in real-time, it might show 14, or if it's not updated, it might still say 12.\n\nAnother angle is that the friends are curious about why the zookeeper is adding and removing penguins. Maybe they wonder if the exhibit is expanding or if there's some kind of breeding program going on.\n\nFurthermore, the dropped hat could be a distraction, making it harder for them to focus on counting the penguins accurately. They might have to wait for the commotion to settle down before trying to count again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hat falls in and a penguin starts playing with it, which could be entertaining to watch, distracting them from counting.\n\nIn any case, based on the initial numbers: starting with 12, adding 4 makes 16, subtracting 2 makes 14. So, logically, there should be 14 penguins in the exhibit now, assuming the two taken away are temporarily absent.\n\nTherefore, Mary, Peter, and Susan probably conclude that there are 14 penguins in the exhibit at the moment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
