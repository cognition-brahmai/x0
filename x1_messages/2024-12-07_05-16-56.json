        "content": "So Tom can paint a fence by himself in 6 hours, and Jerry can do it in 4 hours. If they work together, how long will it take them to paint the fence? Hmm, this seems like a problem about combining work rates.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how much of the fence each of them can paint in one hour. That's their work rate, right? So, Tom's work rate is 1 fence per 6 hours, which means he paints 1/6 of the fence each hour. Similarly, Jerry paints 1/4 of the fence each hour.\n\nNow, if they work together, their work rates should add up. So, together, they paint (1/6 + 1/4) of the fence each hour. To add those fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 4 is 12, I think. So, 1/6 is equal to 2/12, and 1/4 is equal to 3/12. Adding them up, they paint 5/12 of the fence each hour together.\n\nSo, if they paint 5/12 of the fence each hour, how many hours will it take them to paint the whole fence? I think I need to divide the whole fence (which is 1) by their combined rate (5/12). So, time = work / rate, which would be 1 / (5/12) = 12/5 = 2.4 hours.\n\nWait, but is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the formula for combined work rates. I recall something like, if two people work together, the time it takes is equal to the product of their individual times divided by the sum of their individual times. But no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nLet me think again. If Tom takes 6 hours and Jerry takes 4 hours, their rates are 1/6 and 1/4 per hour. Adding rates makes sense. So, together, they paint 1/6 + 1/4 = 5/12 of the fence per hour, as I did before. Then, time is indeed 12/5 = 2.4 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of finding a common work unit. Suppose the fence is 12 units (since 12 is divisible by both 6 and 4). Then, Tom paints 2 units per hour (12/6), and Jerry paints 3 units per hour (12/4). Together, they paint 5 units per hour. So, to paint 12 units, it would take them 12/5 = 2.4 hours.\n\nThat seems consistent across different methods, so I'm fairly confident that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.4} \\]"
