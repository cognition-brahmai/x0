        "content": "So the problem is about finding out how many different combinations of candies a customer can buy if they want exactly 10 candies, and there are three types: chocolate, gummy, and hard candy. The customer can buy any number of each type, which means they could buy all 10 of one type, or a mix of the three types.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved using the concept of combinations with repetition, also known as the stars and bars method. The formula for finding the number of combinations when you have n types of items and you want to choose k items is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of combinations} = \\binom{n + k - 1}{k}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, n is the number of types of candies, which is 3 (chocolate, gummy, hard candy), and k is the total number of candies to be bought, which is 10.\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of combinations} = \\binom{3 + 10 - 1}{10} = \\binom{12}{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\(\\binom{12}{10}\\) is the same as \\(\\binom{12}{2}\\) because \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n - k}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{12}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 different combinations of candies that the customer can purchase.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider that for each type of candy, the customer can buy from 0 up to 10 candies, and the sum of the candies of all types should be exactly 10.\n\nSo, let\u2019s denote:\n\n- c = number of chocolates\n\n- g = number of gummies\n\n- h = number of hard candies\n\nAnd we have:\n\n\\[\nc + g + h = 10\n\\]\n\nWhere c, g, h are non-negative integers (since they can buy 0 up to 10 of each).\n\nThis is a classic example of solving for the number of non-negative integer solutions to an equation, which again is \\(\\binom{n + k - 1}{k}\\), where n is the number of variables (types of candies) and k is the total number of items (candies).\n\nSo, again, \\(\\binom{3 + 10 - 1}{10} = \\binom{12}{10} = 66\\).\n\nWait, but maybe the customer cannot buy 0 of a type, maybe they have to buy at least one of each. The problem says \"any number of each type,\" which includes zero. So, the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem stated that they must buy at least one of each type, then it would be a different scenario. In that case, we would use the formula for positive integer solutions, which is \\(\\binom{n - 1}{k - n}\\).\n\nBut in this case, since zero is allowed, the first approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list out possible combinations, but that would be time-consuming for larger numbers like 10. For smaller numbers, it's manageable, but for 10 candies, it's better to use the combinatorial formula.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 66 different combinations of candies that the customer can purchase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]"
