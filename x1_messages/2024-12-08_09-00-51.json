        "content": "So I've got this problem: if you roll two six-sided dice, what's the probability of getting a sum of 9? Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Each die has six faces, so for two dice, it should be 6 times 6, which is 36 possible outcomes. That makes sense because each die is independent of the other.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 36 outcomes result in a sum of 9. So, I should list out all the possible combinations of the two dice that add up to 9.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If the first die is 3, the second die needs to be 6 to make 9.\n\n- If the first die is 4, the second die needs to be 5.\n\n- If the first die is 5, the second die needs to be 4.\n\n- If the first die is 6, the second die needs to be 3.\n\nSo, there are four combinations: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), and (6,3).\n\nWait, is that all? Let me double-check. If the first die is 2, the second would need to be 7, but that's not possible because the highest on a die is 6. Similarly, if the first die is 1, the second would need to be 8, which is also impossible. So, yes, only those four combinations work.\n\nSo, there are four favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes. To find the probability, I divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThat is: Probability = number of favorable outcomes / total number of possible outcomes = 4 / 36 = 1 / 9.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that probabilities are usually expressed as decimals or fractions, and this is 1/9, which is approximately 0.1111, or about 11.11%. Does that make sense?\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using probability rules or something. For example, the probability of getting a sum of 9 could be calculated by considering the probability of each die showing a certain number that adds up to 9.\n\nSo, for the first die, the possible numbers that can lead to a sum of 9 are 3, 4, 5, and 6, as we saw earlier. For each of these, there's exactly one corresponding number on the second die that makes the sum 9.\n\nSo, the probability for each of these combinations is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36, since each die is independent.\n\nSince there are four such combinations, the total probability is 4 * (1/36) = 1/9.\n\nAlright, that matches what I got earlier. So, I think 1/9 is the correct probability of getting a sum of 9 when rolling two six-sided dice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other ways to get a sum of 9 that I might have missed. For example, could there be a combination like (2,7) or (7,2), but no, because the highest number on a die is 6. So, no, those aren't possible.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the dice are fair, meaning each face has an equal probability of landing face up. If the dice were biased, the probability might be different, but since no such information is given, I can assume they are fair.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure that the dice are independent, meaning the outcome of one die doesn't affect the outcome of the other. Again, with standard dice, this is the case.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of getting a sum of 9 when rolling two fair six-sided dice is 1/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{9}} \\]"
