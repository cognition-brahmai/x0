        "content": "In lunar splendor, the argent orb ascends,\n\nA celestial queen in nocturnal pretensions.\n\nWith ethereal grace, it casts its silvery beams,\n\nUpon the slumbering earth, in tranquil dreams.\n\nThe moon, a beacon in the sable sky,\n\nGuides the wanderer with its steady eye.\n\nIts visage, a canvas of mystic light,\n\nPainted by the hands of celestial might.\n\nThrough phases it waxes, then wanes, in rhythmic play,\n\nA dance of shadows, come what may.\n\nIt bears witness to the ebb and flow,\n\nOf tides that obey its gentle glow.\n\nIn literature, it's a muse's delight,\n\nInspiring poets through the endless night.\n\nFrom Shakespeare to Keats, its charm endures,\n\nA constant presence through the centuries' courses.\n\nThe moon, a symbol of love and lore,\n\nHolds secrets hidden evermore.\n\nIn its craters, tales of ancient time,\n\nEchoes of a universe sublime.\n\nSo here's to thee, O Luna, in thy resplendent might,\n\nMay your light forever guide us through the darkest night.\n\n**Note:** This ode uses words with three or more syllables, as per the user's request."
