Before separating, they agree to meet at the Ferris wheel later. While exploring, Anne hears an announcement that the Ferris wheel will be closed for maintenance during their planned meeting time. She texts Betty and Cathy about the change but forgets to inform Susan. Where will Susan think she should meet her friends, and where will Anne, Betty, and Cathy plan to meet?"

However, Anne, Betty, and Cathy are aware of the Ferris wheel's closure due to maintenance and have been informed via Anne's text to Betty and Cathy. Therefore, they will likely choose an alternative meeting spot. Since the problem doesn't specify where they decide to meet instead, we can assume they pick a new location, but it's not specified which one. So, Susan will be at the Ferris wheel, while Anne, Betty, and Cathy will be at the new meeting place they agreed upon after receiving the information about the Ferris wheel's closure."
