        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of pens: Type A costs $1.50 each, and Type B costs $2.00 each. The customer bought a total of 15 pens for $27.00, and we need to find out how many of each type they purchased.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of Type A pens.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of Type B pens.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of pens is 15.\n\n2. The total cost is $27.00.\n\nSo, we can write two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 15 \\) (since the total number of pens is 15)\n\n2. \\( 1.50x + 2.00y = 27 \\) (since the total cost is $27.00)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I'll use the substitution method here.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( x + y = 15 \\), we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 15 - y \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 1.50(15 - y) + 2.00y = 27 \\)\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\nFirst, distribute the 1.50:\n\n\\( 1.50 \\times 15 - 1.50 \\times y + 2.00y = 27 \\)\n\n\\( 22.5 - 1.5y + 2.0y = 27 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 22.5 + (2.0y - 1.5y) = 27 \\)\n\n\\( 22.5 + 0.5y = 27 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 22.5 from both sides:\n\n\\( 0.5y = 4.5 \\)\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.5:\n\n\\( y = 9 \\)\n\nSo, the number of Type B pens is 9.\n\nNow, substitute \\( y = 9 \\) back into the equation \\( x = 15 - y \\):\n\n\\( x = 15 - 9 \\)\n\n\\( x = 6 \\)\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 6 Type A pens and 9 Type B pens.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it's correct.\n\nFirst, total number of pens: \\( 6 + 9 = 15 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond, total cost: \\( 1.50 \\times 6 + 2.00 \\times 9 = 9.00 + 18.00 = 27.00 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. So, the final answer is 6 Type A pens and 9 Type B pens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ Type A pens and } 9 \\text{ Type B pens}} \\]"
