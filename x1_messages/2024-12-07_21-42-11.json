        "content": "So the problem is: a bus travels 50 miles in an hour, and we need to find out how long it will take to travel 200 miles if the speed remains constant. Okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that speed is equal to distance divided by time. So, speed = distance / time. In this case, the speed is 50 miles per hour. So, 50 = distance / time.\n\nBut wait, we need to find the time it takes to travel 200 miles at this constant speed. So, maybe I can rearrange the formula to solve for time. Time = distance / speed.\n\nSo, time = 200 miles / 50 miles per hour. That would be 200 divided by 50, which is 4. So, 4 hours.\n\nBut let's double-check that. If the bus travels 50 miles in one hour, then in two hours it would travel 100 miles, in three hours 150 miles, and in four hours 200 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. If 50 miles correspond to 1 hour, then 200 miles would correspond to x hours. So, 50/1 = 200/x. Solving for x, we get x = 200/50 = 4 hours.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many 50-mile segments are there in 200 miles. Well, 200 divided by 50 is 4. So, it would take 4 hours.\n\nWait a minute, what if the speed isn't constant? The problem says \"if the speed remains constant,\" so I think it's safe to assume that it is constant. But in real life, bus speeds can vary due to traffic, stops, etc. However, since the problem specifies constant speed, I shouldn't worry about that.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider? Like units. The speed is given in miles per hour, and the distance is in miles, so the units are consistent. No issue there.\n\nLet me consider if there's a possibility of the bus traveling a different path or something, but the problem is straightforward: it's a straight distance-time-speed relationship.\n\nSo, all methods point to 4 hours. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
