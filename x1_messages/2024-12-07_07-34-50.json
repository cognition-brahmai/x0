It's indeed located off the southeastern coast of Africa and is renowned for its biodiversity, hosting a wide variety of unique flora and fauna that are endemic to the island. The separation of Madagascar from the African continent around 88 million years ago has allowed its ecosystems to evolve in isolation, leading to the development of distinct species not found elsewhere. This makes Madagascar a hotspot for biological diversity and a significant area of interest for conservation efforts.\n"
