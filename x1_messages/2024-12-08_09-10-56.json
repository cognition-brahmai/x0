Each plan will be followed by an evidence value which is the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be either the user's question, previous evidence values or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information from Bing. This tool is useful in finding relevant sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from websites given one or more links as input and produces plain text containing the content of the links.\nLinkFilter[input]: Filters out irrelevant links from a list of links and produces a newline delimited response of relevant links.\nAIM[input]: An artificial intelligence model capable of answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the capital of France, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function should just be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., AIM[What is the population of China, given :evidence2:?]\n\nEach plan should have only one evidence output.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what was their most famous work?"
