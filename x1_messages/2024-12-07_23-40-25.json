Quillium** - A brilliant but notoriously forgetful scientist with a penchant for chaos.\n2. **Polly Prime** - An exceptionally intelligent parrot with a sharp tongue and an even sharper beak.\n\n**Setting:**\nA cluttered, high-tech science lab filled with bubbling beakers, strange gadgets, and scattered papers. The walls are adorned with chalkboards covered in complex equations and diagrams.\n\n---\n\n**[Scene 1]**\n\n*(The stage is dimly lit, with various lab equipment glowing softly. Professor Quillium is seen frantically searching through piles of papers, muttering to himself. Polly Prime is perched on a nearby shelf, observing.*) \n\n**Professor Quillium:** (to himself) Where did I put that formula? It was here just a minute ago.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (sardonically) Oh, perhaps it flew away like your last experiment.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (startled) Polly! You scared me. No, it couldn't have flown away. Wait, maybe it did. You know, sometimes I think these papers have minds of their own.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (rolling her eyes) Because that's entirely plausible.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (ignoring Polly) Now, where was I? Oh yes, the time-acceleration device. If only I could remember the exact sequence of events that led to its... er, interesting results last time.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (snickering) Interesting being a euphemism for 'nearly turning the entire lab into a tropical rainforest in five seconds flat.'\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (laughing nervously) Well, one can't have everything, right? Now, let's see... I need to calibrate the temporal flux capacitor. (He starts fiddling with a large, complicated machine in the center of the lab.)\n\n**Polly Prime:** (watching skeptically) And how exactly do you plan to do that without consulting the manual, which, I recall, you left at the caf\u00e9 this morning.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (pausing) Hmm, you're right. I did leave it at the caf\u00e9. Maybe I can remember from memory.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (doubtfully) Because memory has never been your strong suit.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (grinning sheepishly) Hey, I have my moments.\n\n*(He continues to fiddle with the machine, occasionally glancing at Polly for guidance.)*\n\n**Polly Prime:** (after a moment) Professor, aren't you supposed to wear safety goggles when messing with that thing?\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (looking around) Safety goggles? Oh, right! (He rushes to a drawer and pulls out a pair of goggles, perching them on his nose.) All set now.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (nodding approvingly) Much better.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (smiling) Thanks, Polly. Now, let's see... temporal flux, spatial alignment... (He adjusts a few dials and presses a button. Suddenly, the machine hums to life, and a small portal opens, emitting a swirling vortex.)\n\n**Polly Prime:** (alarmed) Professor! What did you do?\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (excitedly) I think I did it! The time-acceleration device is working!\n\n**Polly Prime:** (skeptically) Or you just created a portal to who-knows-where.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (dismissing her concern) Oh, it's probably just leading to the caf\u00e9 down the street. I can go retrieve my manual.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (raising an eyebrow) And what makes you so sure it's leading to the caf\u00e9?\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (shrugging) Well, it's where I left the manual, isn't it? Besides, I could use a coffee.\n\n*(He approaches the portal, hesitating slightly.)*\n\n**Polly Prime:** (warningly) Professor, be careful. You don't know what's on the other side.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (reassuringly) Don't worry, Polly. I'll be fine. (He steps into the portal and disappears.)\n\n**Polly Prime:** (calling out) Professor! Wait for me!\n\n*(She flies towards the portal but hesitates, looking nervous.)*\n\n**Polly Prime:** (to herself) Maybe I should stay here... or maybe I can follow him and make sure he doesn't get into trouble.\n\n*(She takes a deep breath and flies into the portal, disappearing as well.)*\n\n---\n\n**[Scene 2]**\n\n*(The lab is now silent, except for the hum of the machine. Suddenly, the portal swirls, and out steps Professor Quillium, followed by Polly Prime. However, they appear different\u2014Professor Quillium is now wearing a medieval robe, and Polly Prime has transformed into a large, colorful parrot with a crown on her head.)*\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (confused) What happened? I went to the caf\u00e9, got my manual, and then... (He looks down at his robe.) Did I step into the wrong portal?\n\n**Polly Prime:** (also confused) Professor, look at me! I'm... I'm a king parrot!\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (amused) Well, that's certainly... interesting. Maybe the time-acceleration device had a misfire.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (exasperated) Misfire? We've been transported to some alternate reality or something!\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (optimistic) Or perhaps we've traveled back in time to the medieval era! This could be fascinating!\n\n**Polly Prime:** (skeptically) Fascinating for you, maybe. But how are we going to get back?\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (thinking) Well, first, we need to stabilize the portal. If we can recalibrate the device, maybe we can open a portal back to our own time.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (nods) Okay, but we need to be careful. This place seems... different.\n\n*(They start making their way back to the lab, discussing their situation.)*\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (whispering) Shh, Polly, let's not attract too much attention. People might think we're sorcerers or something.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (chuckling) As if being a forgetful professor and a talking parrot isn't already suspicious.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (grinning) Touch\u00e9.\n\n*(They reach the lab, which now looks vastly different\u2014medieval torches replace electric lights, and the equipment seems out of place.)*\n\n**Polly Prime:** (whispering) Professor, this is not good. We need to fix this ASAP.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (nodding) Agreed. Let's see... first, I need to access the main console.\n\n*(He approaches the machine, which still hums with energy. He starts adjusting dials and pressing buttons, trying to recalibrate it.)*\n\n**Polly Prime:** (watching) Is it working?\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (concentrating) I think so... yes! The portal is stabilizing.\n\n*(Suddenly, the portal expands, and out steps another version of Professor Quillium and Polly Prime, but this time, they are wearing futuristic attire\u2014Professor Quillium in a sleek lab coat with advanced gadgets, and Polly Prime in a mini spacesuit.)*\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (surprised) What in the world?\n\n**Future Professor Quillium:** (annoyed) Professor, we need to talk. You can't keep opening portals willy-nilly.\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (defensively) I wasn't expecting company.\n\n**Future Polly Prime:** (exasperated) This is a mess. We need to seal all these portals before they create a temporal paradox.\n\n**Original Polly Prime:** (alarmed) Temporal what?\n\n**Future Professor Quillium:** (explaining) A temporal paradox occurs when actions in one time period interfere with events of another, causing inconsistencies.\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (nodding) Oh, yes, I remember reading about that. So, in essence, we need to close all these portals to prevent any... temporal discrepancies.\n\n**Future Professor Quillium:** (impatiently) Exactly. Now, hand over the manual; I'll guide you through the process.\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (handed the manual) Here you go. So, what do we need to do?\n\n**Future Professor Quillium:** (studying the manual) First, we need to synchronize the temporal flux capacitors across all portals.\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (nods) Got it. (He starts adjusting the machine accordingly.)\n\n**Future Professor Quillium:** (continuing) Then, we need to initiate a temporal lock sequence.\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (confused) Temporal lock sequence? How do I do that?\n\n**Future Professor Quillium:** (exasperated) It's on page 37 of the manual.\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (flipping through the manual) Ah, here it is. Okay, so I need to enter the code sequence...\n\n**Polly Prime:** (from the original timeline) Professor, are you sure about this? It seems complicated.\n\n**Future Professor Quillium:** (firmly) Trust me; it's the only way to prevent a catastrophic temporal collapse.\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (nervously) Okay, here goes nothing. (He enters the code sequence into the machine.)\n\n*Suddenly, there's a bright flash, and all the portals begin to close one by one.*\n\n**Original Polly Prime:** (relieved) That's it? It's over?\n\n**Future Professor Quillium:** (nodding) For now. But we need to make sure that the device is properly shut down to prevent any future accidents.\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (agreed) Absolutely. I'll work on implementing some safety protocols.\n\n**Future Polly Prime:** (smiling) Good. Now, if you'll excuse us, we need to return to our own time.\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (shaking hands with Future Professor Quillium) Good luck with your research.\n\n**Future Professor Quillium:** (smiling) And to you as well. (He and Future Polly Prime step into the last remaining portal, which closes behind them.)\n\n**Original Professor Quillium:** (sighs) Well, that was eventful.\n\n**Polly Prime:** (agreed) Indeed. Maybe next time, think before you press buttons.\n\n**Professor Quillium:** (chuckling) Easier said than done, Polly. Easier said than done.\n\n*(They both laugh as the lights fade to black.)*\n\n---\n\n**[End of Play]**"
