        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Node.js script that connects to a MongoDB database, creates a \"users\" collection, and inserts three sample user documents with name, email, and age fields.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js installed, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.\n\nLet's start by initializing a new Node.js project. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis will create a `package.json` file with some default settings.\n\nNext, we need to install the MongoDB driver for Node.js. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mongodb\n```\n\nNow, let's create a new file called `app.js` in your project directory. This is where we'll write our script.\n\nFirst, we need to import the MongoDB driver. Add the following line at the top of `app.js`:\n\n```javascript\nconst { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');\n```\n\nNext, we need to define the connection URL for our MongoDB database. For local development, you can use the following URL:\n\n```javascript\nconst url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';\n```\n\nMake sure that your MongoDB server is running locally on the default port (27017). If you're using a different host or port, adjust the URL accordingly.\n\nNow, let's define the database name. Let's call it \"mydatabase\":\n\n```javascript\nconst dbName = 'mydatabase';\n```\n\nNext, we'll create a function to connect to the MongoDB server and insert the sample user documents. Add the following code to `app.js`:\n\n```javascript\nasync function main() {\n  const client = new MongoClient(url);\n\n  try {\n    await client.connect();\n    console.log('Connected successfully to server');\n\n    const db = client.db(dbName);\n    const collection = db.collection('users');\n\n    // Create three sample user documents\n    const users = [\n      { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com', age: 25 },\n      { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com', age: 30 },\n      { name: 'Charlie', email: 'charlie@example.com', age: 35 }\n    ];\n\n    // Insert the documents into the collection\n    const result = await collection.insertMany(users);\n    console.log(`${result.insertedCount} documents were inserted`);\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error connecting to the database:', err);\n  } finally {\n    await client.close();\n  }\n}\n\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\nLet's break down what this code does:\n\n1. **Connecting to the Database:** We create a new `MongoClient` instance and connect to the MongoDB server using the provided URL.\n\n2. **Accessing the Database and Collection:** We access the \"mydatabase\" database and the \"users\" collection within it.\n\n3. **Creating Sample User Documents:** We define an array of three user objects, each with name, email, and age fields.\n\n4. **Inserting Documents:** We use the `insertMany` method to insert the user documents into the \"users\" collection.\n\n5. **Handling Errors and Closing the Connection:** We handle any errors that occur during the connection or insertion process and ensure that the connection is closed finally.\n\nFinally, make sure that your MongoDB server is running. You can start it by running the following command in another terminal window:\n\n```bash\nmongod\n```\n\nNow, go back to your project directory and run your Node.js script:\n\n```bash\nnode app.js\n```\n\nYou should see output indicating that the connection was successful and that three documents were inserted.\n\nThat's it! You've created a Node.js script that connects to a MongoDB database, creates a \"users\" collection, and inserts three sample user documents.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
