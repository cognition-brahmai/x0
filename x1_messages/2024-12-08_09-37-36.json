        "content": "So I have this limit to calculate: the limit as x approaches infinity of e^x divided by x squared. That is, lim (x\u2192\u221e) of (e^x)/(x^2). Hmm, interesting. I know that both e^x and x^2 grow without bound as x approaches infinity, but I'm not sure how their ratio behaves. Maybe I can use L'H\u00f4pital's rule since it's an infinity over infinity form.\n\nL'H\u00f4pital's rule says that if the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x approaches some value is of the form \u221e/\u221e or 0/0, then the limit of f(x)/g(x) is equal to the limit of f'(x)/g'(x), provided that latter limit exists.\n\nSo, let's set f(x) = e^x and g(x) = x^2. Both f(x) and g(x) approach infinity as x approaches infinity, so L'H\u00f4pital's rule applies.\n\nFirst, I'll find the derivatives:\n\nf'(x) = e^x\n\ng'(x) = 2x\n\nSo, applying L'H\u00f4pital's rule once, I get:\n\nlim (x\u2192\u221e) (e^x)/(x^2) = lim (x\u2192\u221e) (e^x)/(2x)\n\nNow, again, as x approaches infinity, e^x and 2x both approach infinity, so I can apply L'H\u00f4pital's rule again.\n\nSecond application:\n\nf''(x) = e^x\n\ng''(x) = 2\n\nSo, lim (x\u2192\u221e) (e^x)/(2x) = lim (x\u2192\u221e) (e^x)/2\n\nWell, e^x grows without bound, and dividing by 2 just gives (1/2)e^x, which still grows without bound. Therefore, the limit is infinity.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that I applied L'H\u00f4pital's rule correctly each time. Let's double-check.\n\nFirst application:\n\nOriginal limit: (e^x)/(x^2)\n\nDerivatives: f'(x) = e^x, g'(x) = 2x\n\nSo, new limit: (e^x)/(2x)\n\nSecond application:\n\nNow, (e^x)/(2x), which is still \u221e/\u221e as x\u2192\u221e\n\nDerivatives: f''(x) = e^x, g''(x) = 2\n\nNew limit: (e^x)/2\n\nWhich indeed approaches infinity as x approaches infinity.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the fact that exponential functions grow faster than polynomial functions. Since e^x is exponential and x^2 is polynomial, e^x should dominate as x gets large, leading to the ratio approaching infinity.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the Taylor series expansion of e^x, which is 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... . So, e^x is greater than x^2/2! for large x, meaning e^x > x^2/2 for large x. Therefore, (e^x)/(x^2) > 1/2 for large x, and since e^x grows much faster, the ratio actually goes to infinity.\n\nAlternatively, I could take natural logarithm of the expression to analyze its behavior, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, actually, let's try that.\n\nLet y = (e^x)/(x^2)\n\nThen, ln(y) = ln(e^x) - ln(x^2) = x - 2ln(x)\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, x grows much faster than ln(x), so x - 2ln(x) approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, ln(y) approaches infinity, which implies that y approaches e^(\u221e), which is infinity.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider substituting t = 1/x, so as x\u2192\u221e, t\u21920.\n\nThen, (e^x)/(x^2) = (e^{1/t})/(1/t)^2 = t^2 e^{1/t}\n\nNow, as t\u21920+, 1/t approaches infinity, and e^{1/t} grows extremely rapidly, much faster than t^2 approaches zero. Therefore, the product t^2 e^{1/t} approaches infinity.\n\nFor t\u21920-, 1/t approaches negative infinity, and e^{1/t} approaches e^{-\u221e} = 0. However, t^2 approaches 0, but since e^{1/t} approaches 0 faster than t^2 approaches 0, the product t^2 e^{1/t} approaches 0.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, x approaches infinity, which corresponds to t approaching 0 from the positive side (since x is positive and approaching infinity). So, t\u21920+.\n\nTherefore, the limit is infinity.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the behavior as x approaches negative infinity.\n\nWait, but the original question is as x approaches infinity, so I don't need to consider x approaching negative infinity. However, for completeness, let's consider it briefly.\n\nIf x approaches negative infinity, e^x approaches 0, while x^2 approaches positive infinity. Therefore, (e^x)/(x^2) approaches 0/infinity, which is 0.\n\nBut again, the original question is about x approaching positive infinity.\n\nSo, to summarize, using L'H\u00f4pital's rule twice, or by considering the growth rates of exponential vs. polynomial functions, or by taking the natural logarithm, or by substitution, I arrive at the same conclusion: the limit is infinity.\n\nTherefore, lim (x\u2192\u221e) (e^x)/(x^2) = \u221e.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\infty} \\]"
