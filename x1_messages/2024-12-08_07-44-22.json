        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a box with 4 red balls, 6 green balls, and 5 blue balls. That's a total of 4 + 6 + 5 = 15 balls. We're picking three balls without replacement, and we want to find the probability that all three balls are different colors. That means one red, one green, and one blue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when picking three balls out of 15. Since the order in which we pick the balls doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 15 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = \\binom{15}{3} = \\frac{15!}{3!(15-3)!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 455\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 455 different ways to choose any three balls from the box.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the scenarios where I pick one ball of each color. So, one red, one green, and one blue.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red ball out of four is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one green ball out of six is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{1} = 6\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one blue ball out of five is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{1} = 5\n\\]\n\nSince these choices are independent, the total number of ways to choose one ball of each color is the product of these individual choices:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable outcomes} = 4 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 120\n\\]\n\nNow, the probability that all three balls are different colors is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all different colors}) = \\frac{120}{455}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\div 5}{455 \\div 5} = \\frac{24}{91}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{24}{91}\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the problem step by step, considering the sequence in which the balls are picked.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red ball first is \\(\\frac{4}{15}\\), since there are 4 red balls out of 15 total balls.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, there are now 14 balls left, with 6 green and 5 blue. The probability of picking a green ball next is \\(\\frac{6}{14}\\).\n\nFinally, given that the first ball was red and the second was green, there are now 13 balls left, with 5 blue. The probability of picking a blue ball third is \\(\\frac{5}{13}\\).\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence\u2014red, then green, then blue\u2014is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{15} \\times \\frac{6}{14} \\times \\frac{5}{13}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, there are other sequences where we can pick one of each color: red, blue, green; green, red, blue; green, blue, red; blue, red, green; blue, green, red.\n\nIn total, there are \\(3! = 6\\) different sequences in which we can pick one of each color.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{15} \\times \\frac{6}{14} \\times \\frac{5}{13} \\right)\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, calculate the product inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{15} \\times \\frac{6}{14} = \\frac{24}{210} = \\frac{4}{35}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{35} \\times \\frac{5}{13} = \\frac{20}{455} = \\frac{4}{91}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 6:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\frac{4}{91} = \\frac{24}{91}\n\\]\n\nSo, I get the same answer, \\(\\frac{24}{91}\\), using this alternative approach. That gives me more confidence that my initial answer was correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's yet another way to verify this. Maybe using permutations.\n\nIf I think about the total number of ways to pick three balls in order, that would be permutations. The total number of permutations of 15 balls taken 3 at a time is:\n\n\\[\nP(15, 3) = 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 = 2730\n\\]\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, again, there are 4 choices for red, 6 for green, and 5 for blue, and 6 different orders.\n\nSo, the number of favorable permutations is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times (4 \\times 6 \\times 5) = 6 \\times 120 = 720\n\\]\n\nThen, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{720}{2730} = \\frac{24}{91}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance I'm missing something. For example, are there any dependencies or conditions that I haven't accounted for? In this problem, since we're picking without replacement and considering different colors, I think the approaches I've used cover it adequately.\n\nAlso, I should check if the fraction can be simplified further. \\(\\frac{24}{91}\\) doesn't seem to reduce any more because 24 and 91 don't share any common factors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the probability is \\(\\frac{24}{91}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{91}} \\]"
