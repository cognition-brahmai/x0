        "content": "So, the car is going at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, and you want to know how far it travels in that time. Okay, to figure this out, I remember that distance, speed, and time are related. The basic formula is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 5 hours. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 5 hours\n\nWhen you multiply these, the hours unit cancels out, leaving you with miles. So:\n\nDistance = 300 miles\n\nTherefore, the car travels 300 miles in 5 hours at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. What if the speed wasn't constant? The problem says \"average speed,\" which means that even if the car sped up and slowed down at different points, overall, it averaged 60 miles per hour. So, the formula still applies.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that in one hour, the car travels 60 miles. So, in 5 hours, it would travel 5 times that distance, which is 300 miles. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also use the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time. So, if I have the average speed and the time, I can rearrange the formula to find distance:\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nRearranging:\n\nTotal Distance = Average Speed \u00d7 Total Time\n\nAgain, plugging in the values:\n\nTotal Distance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 5 hours = 300 miles\n\nSame answer. So, I'm confident that 300 miles is the correct distance the car travels in 5 hours at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
