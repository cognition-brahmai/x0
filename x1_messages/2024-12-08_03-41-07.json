        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and they play different sports: soccer, basketball, and volleyball. Specifically, 14 play soccer, 12 play basketball, and 18 play volleyball. Additionally, 6 students play all three sports. We need to find out how many students don't play any of these sports.\n\nFirst, I think I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find out how many students play at least one sport. The principle of inclusion-exclusion helps us avoid double-counting students who play multiple sports.\n\nThe formula for three sets is:\n\nNumber of students playing at least one sport = (Number playing soccer) + (Number playing basketball) + (Number playing volleyball) - (Number playing both soccer and basketball) - (Number playing both soccer and volleyball) - (Number playing both basketball and volleyball) + (Number playing all three sports)\n\nWe know the numbers for soccer, basketball, and volleyball, and we know that 6 play all three sports. However, we don't have the numbers for students playing exactly two sports. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can use variables for the unknowns.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- S as the set of students playing soccer,\n\n- B as the set playing basketball,\n\n- V as the set playing volleyball.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |S| = 14,\n\n- |B| = 12,\n\n- |V| = 18,\n\n- |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = 6.\n\nWe need to find the number of students who don't play any sports, which would be the total number of students minus those who play at least one sport.\n\nSo, first, find |S \u222a B \u222a V|, and then subtract it from 30.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|S \u222a B \u222a V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|\n\nWe know |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = 6, but we don't know the pairwise intersections: |S \u2229 B|, |S \u2229 V|, and |B \u2229 V|.\n\nMaybe I can express these pairwise intersections in terms of other known quantities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate these using the total numbers.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can consider the total number of sport participations.\n\nEach student who plays one sport is counted once, those who play two sports are counted twice, and those who play three sports are counted three times.\n\nSo, total sport participations = number of students playing soccer + number playing basketball + number playing volleyball = 14 + 12 + 18 = 44.\n\nBut, this total counts students playing two sports twice and those playing three sports three times.\n\nWe can express the total participations in terms of students playing one, two, or three sports.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- x = number of students playing exactly one sport,\n\n- y = number of students playing exactly two sports,\n\n- z = number of students playing exactly three sports.\n\nWe know that z = 6, since 6 students play all three sports.\n\nNow, the total number of sport participations is:\n\nx (each counts once) + 2y (each counts twice) + 3z (each counts three times) = x + 2y + 3z = 44.\n\nAlso, the total number of students playing at least one sport is:\n\nx + y + z.\n\nWe know z = 6, so:\n\nx + y + 6.\n\nBut we don't know x and y yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can set up equations to solve for x and y.\n\nFrom the total participations:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 44.\n\nAnd from the total students playing at least one sport:\n\nx + y + z = number of students playing at least one sport.\n\nWe also know that the total number of students is 30, so:\n\nnumber of students playing at least one sport + number of students playing no sports = 30.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of students playing no sports.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nn = number of students playing at least one sport,\n\nthen, number of students playing no sports = 30 - n.\n\nSo, we need to find n to find 30 - n.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nn = x + y + z = x + y + 6.\n\nAnd from participations:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 44.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) x + y + 6 = n\n\n2) x + 2y + 18 = 44 (since z = 6, 3z = 18)\n\nWait, equation 2 should be:\n\nx + 2y + 3*6 = x + 2y + 18 = 44.\n\nSo, x + 2y = 26.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx + y = n - 6.\n\nNow, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x + 2y) - (x + y) = 26 - (n - 6),\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\ny = 26 - n + 6 = 32 - n.\n\nNow, substitute y back into equation 1:\n\nx + (32 - n) = n - 6,\n\nso x = n - 6 - (32 - n) = n - 6 - 32 + n = 2n - 38.\n\nNow, we have expressions for x and y in terms of n.\n\nBut I need another equation to solve for n.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the total number of students is 30.\n\nWe have:\n\nn (playing at least one sport) + (30 - n) (playing no sports).\n\nBut I don't have information about students playing no sports directly.\n\nMaybe I need to find another relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\na = number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\nThen, y = a.\n\nAnd z = 6.\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nn = |S \u222a B \u222a V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|.\n\nWe can express the pairwise intersections in terms of a and z.\n\nNote that:\n\n|S \u2229 B| = number of students playing both soccer and basketball, which includes those playing exactly two sports (a) and those playing all three (z).\n\nWait, actually, the number of students playing exactly two sports in, say, soccer and basketball would be |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|.\n\nBecause |S \u2229 B| includes those who play only soccer and basketball plus those who play all three.\n\nSo, |S \u2229 B| = number playing exactly two sports (soccer and basketball) + number playing all three.\n\nSimilarly for the other pairwise intersections.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- p = number of students playing exactly soccer and basketball,\n\n- q = number of students playing exactly soccer and volleyball,\n\n- r = number of students playing exactly basketball and volleyball.\n\nThen:\n\n|S \u2229 B| = p + z,\n\n|S \u2229 V| = q + z,\n\n|B \u2229 V| = r + z.\n\nAnd the number of students playing exactly two sports is a = p + q + r.\n\nNow, the inclusion-exclusion formula becomes:\n\nn = |S| + |B| + |V| - (p + z) - (q + z) - (r + z) + z\n\nSimplify:\n\nn = 14 + 12 + 18 - (p + 6) - (q + 6) - (r + 6) + 6\n\nn = 44 - (p + q + r + 18) + 6\n\nn = 44 - (a + 18) + 6\n\nSince a = p + q + r,\n\nn = 44 - a - 18 + 6\n\nn = 44 - 18 + 6 - a\n\nn = 32 - a\n\nSo, n = 32 - a.\n\nBut we also have from earlier that y = a.\n\nAnd from earlier, y = 32 - n.\n\nWait, but now I have n = 32 - a, and y = a.\n\nFrom n = 32 - a, and y = a, so y = 32 - n.\n\nWhich is consistent with what I had earlier.\n\nThis seems a bit circular.\n\nMaybe I need to find another way.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the total number of students again.\n\nTotal students = students playing no sports + students playing at least one sport.\n\n30 = (30 - n) + n.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t help much.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look back at the total sport participations.\n\nTotal participations = 44, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut, total participations can also be expressed in terms of x, y, and z.\n\nEach student playing one sport is counted once, playing two sports is counted twice, playing three sports is counted three times.\n\nSo, total participations = x + 2y + 3z = 44.\n\nWe have z = 6, so:\n\nx + 2y + 18 = 44 \u21d2 x + 2y = 26.\n\nFrom the number of students playing at least one sport:\n\nx + y + z = x + y + 6 = n.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) x + y = n - 6,\n\n2) x + 2y = 26.\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x + 2y) - (x + y) = 26 - (n - 6) \u21d2 y = 26 - n + 6 \u21d2 y = 32 - n.\n\nBut y also equals a, the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\nNow, from n = x + y + 6, and x = n - y - 6.\n\nBut I need another equation to solve for n.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the total number of students is 30.\n\nWe have:\n\nn + (students playing no sports) = 30.\n\nBut without knowing the students playing no sports directly, I need to find another relationship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the number of students playing exactly two sports in terms of the pairwise intersections.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find the pairwise intersections.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|S \u2229 B| = p + z = p + 6,\n\n|S \u2229 V| = q + z = q + 6,\n\n|B \u2229 V| = r + z = r + 6.\n\nBut I don\u2019t have values for |S \u2229 B|, |S \u2229 V|, or |B \u2229 V|.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula again.\n\nWe have:\n\nn = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\nn = 14 + 12 + 18 - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + 6.\n\nSimplify:\n\nn = 44 - (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|) + 6 \u21d2 n = 50 - (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|).\n\nSo, |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = 50 - n.\n\nBut from earlier, |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = (p + 6) + (q + 6) + (r + 6) = p + q + r + 18 = a + 18.\n\nSo, a + 18 = 50 - n \u21d2 a = 32 - n.\n\nBut a also equals y, which is 32 - n, as I had earlier.\n\nThis seems consistent but doesn\u2019t give me a new equation.\n\nI need to find a way to relate these variables to the total number of students or participations.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the number of students playing exactly two sports is a = p + q + r = 32 - n.\n\nAnd from earlier, x + y + z = n \u21d2 x + (32 - n) + 6 = n \u21d2 x + 38 - n = n \u21d2 x = 2n - 38.\n\nNow, from x + 2y + 3z = 44, substitute x and y:\n\n(2n - 38) + 2(32 - n) + 18 = 44.\n\nLet\u2019s compute that:\n\n2n - 38 + 64 - 2n + 18 = 44 \u21d2 (-38 + 64 + 18) = 44 \u21d2 44 = 44.\n\nOh, it simplifies to 44 = 44, which is always true but doesn\u2019t help me solve for n.\n\nThis suggests that the equations are dependent, and I need additional information to find a unique solution for n.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a constraint I'm missing.\n\nConsider that the number of students playing exactly one sport is x, exactly two sports is y, and exactly three sports is z.\n\nThe total number of students playing at least one sport is x + y + z.\n\nWe have:\n\nx = number playing exactly one sport,\n\ny = number playing exactly two sports,\n\nz = number playing exactly three sports = 6.\n\nWe also have:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = total participations = 44.\n\nAnd x + y + z = n.\n\nWe can substitute z = 6 into these equations.\n\nSo:\n\nx + 2y + 18 = 44 \u21d2 x + 2y = 26,\n\nand x + y + 6 = n \u21d2 x + y = n - 6.\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(x + 2y) - (x + y) = 26 - (n - 6) \u21d2 y = 26 - n + 6 \u21d2 y = 32 - n.\n\nNow, since y represents the number of students playing exactly two sports, and y must be non-negative, so y \u2265 0 \u21d2 32 - n \u2265 0 \u21d2 n \u2264 32.\n\nBut n is the number of students playing at least one sport, and there are only 30 students in total, so n \u2264 30.\n\nSimilarly, since z = 6, and y = 32 - n, and x = n - y - 6 = n - (32 - n) - 6 = 2n - 38.\n\nNow, x must be non-negative, so x \u2265 0 \u21d2 2n - 38 \u2265 0 \u21d2 n \u2265 19.\n\nSo, n must be between 19 and 30.\n\nBut I need to find the exact value of n.\n\nPerhaps there's another constraint I can use.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the total number of students again.\n\nTotal students = students playing at least one sport + students playing no sports.\n\n30 = n + (30 - n).\n\nThat doesn't give new information.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the number of students playing exactly two sports in relation to the pairwise intersections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an assumption I can make about the overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula that directly gives the number of students playing no sports.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle can be used to find the number of students playing at least one sport, and then subtract that from the total to find those playing no sports.\n\nSo, number playing no sports = 30 - n, where n = |S \u222a B \u222a V|.\n\nFrom inclusion-exclusion:\n\nn = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|.\n\nWe know |S| = 14, |B| = 12, |V| = 18, |S \u2229 B \u2229 V| = 6.\n\nSo, n = 14 + 12 + 18 - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + 6 = 44 - (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|).\n\nLet\u2019s denote t = |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|.\n\nThen, n = 44 - t.\n\nBut I don't know t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate t to the total participations.\n\nTotal participations = |S| + |B| + |V| = 44.\n\nBut also, total participations can be expressed as:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = x + 2y + 18 = 44 \u21d2 x + 2y = 26.\n\nFrom earlier, y = 32 - n.\n\nSubstitute into x + 2y = 26:\n\nx + 2(32 - n) = 26 \u21d2 x + 64 - 2n = 26 \u21d2 x = 2n - 38.\n\nBut x must be \u2265 0, so 2n - 38 \u2265 0 \u21d2 n \u2265 19.\n\nWe already have n \u2264 30.\n\nSo n can be from 19 to 30.\n\nBut to find the exact n, perhaps I need to consider that the number of students playing exactly two sports cannot exceed the total number of students playing at least one sport.\n\nSo, y \u2264 n.\n\nBut y = 32 - n \u2264 n \u21d2 32 - n \u2264 n \u21d2 32 \u2264 2n \u21d2 n \u2265 16.\n\nBut we already have n \u2265 19, so this doesn't add new information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the maximum possible value for y.\n\nSince y = 32 - n, and y \u2264 n (because y is part of n), then 32 - n \u2264 n \u21d2 n \u2265 16.\n\nBut again, n \u2265 19 from earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the maximum possible value for y in terms of the pairwise intersections.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the number of students playing at least one sport, n.\n\nWe have:\n\nn = |S \u222a B \u222a V| = |S| + |B| + |V| - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 V|.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\nn = 14 + 12 + 18 - |S \u2229 B| - |S \u2229 V| - |B \u2229 V| + 6 = 44 - (|S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|).\n\nLet\u2019s denote the sum of the pairwise intersections as t = |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|.\n\nThen, n = 44 - t.\n\nNow, we need to find t to find n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find t in terms of other known quantities.\n\nWe know that the number of students playing all three sports is 6.\n\nNow, in terms of the pairwise intersections, we have:\n\n|S \u2229 B| = number playing soccer and basketball, which includes those playing all three.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut without additional information about the pairwise intersections, it seems difficult to find t directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the total number of students playing at least one sport is less than or equal to 30.\n\nSo, n \u2264 30.\n\nFrom n = 44 - t, we have t = 44 - n.\n\nBut t represents the sum of the pairwise intersections, which must be non-negative.\n\nSo, t \u2265 0 \u21d2 44 - n \u2265 0 \u21d2 n \u2264 44.\n\nBut since n \u2264 30, this doesn't provide new information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the minimum possible value for t.\n\nEach pairwise intersection must be at least the number of students playing all three sports, which is 6.\n\nSo, |S \u2229 B| \u2265 6, |S \u2229 V| \u2265 6, |B \u2229 V| \u2265 6.\n\nTherefore, t = |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| \u2265 18.\n\nTherefore, t \u2265 18.\n\nFrom n = 44 - t, and t \u2265 18, we have n \u2264 26.\n\nBut earlier, we had n \u2265 19.\n\nSo now, n can be from 19 to 26.\n\nBut I need to find the exact value of n.\n\nPerhaps there's another constraint I can use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the number of students playing exactly two sports.\n\nWe have y = a = 32 - n.\n\nBut y must be non-negative, so 32 - n \u2265 0 \u21d2 n \u2264 32.\n\nBut n \u2264 26 from earlier, so n \u2264 26.\n\nAlso, n \u2265 19.\n\nSo n is between 19 and 26.\n\nPerhaps I can consider specific values within this range to see which one fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find t directly.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the number of students playing exactly two sports is y = a = 32 - n.\n\nNow, the sum of the pairwise intersections t = |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V|.\n\nWe can express each pairwise intersection as the number of students playing exactly two sports plus those playing all three.\n\nSo, |S \u2229 B| = number playing exactly soccer and basketball + number playing all three = p + 6.\n\nSimilarly, |S \u2229 V| = q + 6, and |B \u2229 V| = r + 6.\n\nTherefore, t = (p + 6) + (q + 6) + (r + 6) = p + q + r + 18 = y + 18 = (32 - n) + 18 = 50 - n.\n\nTherefore, t = 50 - n.\n\nNow, from n = 44 - t, substitute t = 50 - n:\n\nn = 44 - (50 - n) = 44 - 50 + n = -6 + n.\n\nWait a minute, that gives n = -6 + n, which implies 0 = -6, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that there's an error in my reasoning.\n\nLet me check my steps.\n\nI had:\n\nt = |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = (p + 6) + (q + 6) + (r + 6) = p + q + r + 18 = y + 18 = (32 - n) + 18 = 50 - n.\n\nThen, n = 44 - t = 44 - (50 - n) = 44 - 50 + n = -6 + n.\n\nThis leads to n = n - 6, which implies 0 = -6, which is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in my earlier assumptions.\n\nPerhaps the error is in assuming that y = a = 32 - n.\n\nLet me revisit that.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nn = x + y + z = x + y + 6.\n\nFrom x + y = n - 6.\n\nAnd from x + 2y = 26.\n\nSubtracting these: (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 26 - (n - 6) \u21d2 y = 26 - n + 6 \u21d2 y = 32 - n.\n\nWait, that seems to be the source of the problem, as it leads to the contradiction.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me try to set up the equations again.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y + z = n,\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 44,\n\nwith z = 6.\n\nSubstitute z into the equations:\n\nx + y + 6 = n,\n\nx + 2y + 18 = 44 \u21d2 x + 2y = 26.\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from this:\n\n(x + 2y) - (x + y + 6) = 26 - n \u21d2 y - 6 = 26 - n \u21d2 y = 32 - n.\n\nThis again leads to the same expression, which caused the contradiction earlier.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the system of equations is inconsistent, suggesting an error in the initial problem setup or in the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to solve this problem.\n\nLet\u2019s consider using a Venn diagram approach.\n\nWe have three circles representing soccer, basketball, and volleyball, with overlaps representing students playing multiple sports.\n\nThe center overlap, where all three circles intersect, represents students playing all three sports, which is 6 students.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- a = number of students playing only soccer,\n\n- b = number of students playing only basketball,\n\n- c = number of students playing only volleyball,\n\n- d = number of students playing soccer and basketball but not volleyball,\n\n- e = number of students playing soccer and volleyball but not basketball,\n\n- f = number of students playing basketball and volleyball but not soccer,\n\n- g = number of students playing all three sports = 6.\n\nThen, the total number of students playing at least one sport is:\n\nn = a + b + c + d + e + f + g.\n\nWe also have:\n\n- Total soccer players: a + d + e + g = 14,\n\n- Total basketball players: b + d + f + g = 12,\n\n- Total volleyball players: c + e + f + g = 18.\n\nWe know g = 6.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na + d + e + 6 = 14 \u21d2 a + d + e = 8, (1)\n\nb + d + f + 6 = 12 \u21d2 b + d + f = 6, (2)\n\nc + e + f + 6 = 18 \u21d2 c + e + f = 12. (3)\n\nNow, add equations (1), (2), and (3):\n\n(a + d + e) + (b + d + f) + (c + e + f) = 8 + 6 + 12 = 26.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\na + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f = 26.\n\nBut from n = a + b + c + d + e + f + g, and g = 6, we have n = a + b + c + d + e + f + 6.\n\nWe can express a + b + c as n - d - e - f - 6.\n\nSubstitute into the earlier equation:\n\n(n - d - e - f - 6) + 2d + 2e + 2f = 26 \u21d2 n + d + e + f - 6 = 26 \u21d2 n + d + e + f = 32.\n\nBut n = a + b + c + d + e + f + 6, and a + b + c = n - d - e - f - 6.\n\nThis seems a bit circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can solve for a, b, c, d, e, f in terms of n.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for d + e + f.\n\nFrom equations (1), (2), and (3):\n\na + d + e = 8, (1)\n\nb + d + f = 6, (2)\n\nc + e + f = 12. (3)\n\nAdd these:\n\na + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f = 26.\n\nBut from n = a + b + c + d + e + f + 6, we can express a + b + c = n - d - e - f - 6.\n\nSubstitute into the earlier sum:\n\n(n - d - e - f - 6) + 2d + 2e + 2f = 26 \u21d2 n + d + e + f - 6 = 26 \u21d2 n + d + e + f = 32.\n\nSo, d + e + f = 32 - n.\n\nNow, from equation (1): a + d + e = 8 \u21d2 a = 8 - d - e.\n\nFrom equation (2): b + d + f = 6 \u21d2 b = 6 - d - f.\n\nFrom equation (3): c + e + f = 12 \u21d2 c = 12 - e - f.\n\nNow, a, b, c must be non-negative, so:\n\n8 - d - e \u2265 0 \u21d2 d + e \u2264 8,\n\n6 - d - f \u2265 0 \u21d2 d + f \u2264 6,\n\n12 - e - f \u2265 0 \u21d2 e + f \u2264 12.\n\nAlso, since d, e, f are non-negative, d \u2265 0, e \u2265 0, f \u2265 0.\n\nNow, n = a + b + c + d + e + f + 6 = (8 - d - e) + (6 - d - f) + (12 - e - f) + d + e + f + 6.\n\nSimplify:\n\n8 - d - e + 6 - d - f + 12 - e - f + d + e + f + 6.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8 + 6 + 12 + 6) + (-d - d + d) + (-e - e + e) + (-f - f + f) = 32 - d - e - f.\n\nWait, that seems off.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f + g = (8 - d - e) + (6 - d - f) + (12 - e - f) + d + e + f + 6.\n\nLet\u2019s add step by step:\n\nFirst, a + b + c:\n\n(8 - d - e) + (6 - d - f) + (12 - e - f) = 8 + 6 + 12 - d - e - d - f - e - f = 26 - 2d - 2e - 2f.\n\nNow, add d + e + f + g:\n\n26 - 2d - 2e - 2f + d + e + f + 6 = 26 - d - e - f + 6 = 32 - (d + e + f).\n\nBut earlier, we have n = 32 - (d + e + f).\n\nBut from n + d + e + f = 32, that implies n = 32 - (d + e + f).\n\nSo, n = 32 - (d + e + f).\n\nBut from earlier, d + e + f = 32 - n.\n\nSubstituting back, n = 32 - (32 - n) \u21d2 n = n, which is just an identity and doesn't help.\n\nIt seems like I'm going in circles.\n\nPerhaps there's a different approach I should take.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the total number of students is 30, and some play no sports.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of students playing no sports as m.\n\nThen, m = 30 - n.\n\nOur goal is to find m.\n\nIf I can find n, then m is straightforward.\n\nBut from the earlier analysis, n = 32 - (d + e + f), but d + e + f = 32 - n, which again leads to n = 32 - (32 - n) \u21d2 n = n.\n\nThis seems like a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the number of students playing exactly two sports is d + e + f.\n\nFrom earlier, y = d + e + f = 32 - n.\n\nBut y must be non-negative, so 32 - n \u2265 0 \u21d2 n \u2264 32.\n\nBut n cannot exceed the total number of students, which is 30, so n \u2264 30.\n\nSimilarly, from x = a \u2265 0, we have x = n - y - 6 = n - (32 - n) - 6 = 2n - 38 \u2265 0 \u21d2 2n - 38 \u2265 0 \u21d2 n \u2265 19.\n\nSo, n can be from 19 to 30.\n\nBut without more constraints, it's difficult to pin down the exact value of n.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the problem statement, or perhaps there's a missing piece of information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the number of students playing no sports can be determined without knowing n exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express m in terms of n and see if it leads to a solvable equation.\n\nWe have m = 30 - n.\n\nBut n = 32 - (d + e + f), and d + e + f = 32 - n.\n\nThis seems circular again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the sum of students playing exactly one sport, exactly two sports, and exactly three sports equals the total number playing at least one sport.\n\nSo, x + y + z = n.\n\nWe have z = 6, and y = 32 - n, and x = n - y - z = n - (32 - n) - 6 = 2n - 38.\n\nNow, since x must be non-negative, 2n - 38 \u2265 0 \u21d2 n \u2265 19.\n\nAlso, y = 32 - n \u2265 0 \u21d2 n \u2264 32.\n\nBut n cannot exceed the total number of students, which is 30, so n \u2264 30.\n\nTherefore, n can be from 19 to 30.\n\nNow, perhaps I can consider the total number of sport participations again.\n\nTotal participations = x + 2y + 3z = (2n - 38) + 2(32 - n) + 18 = 2n - 38 + 64 - 2n + 18 = 44.\n\nWait, this just confirms the earlier total participations, which is consistent but doesn't help in finding n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the number of students playing exactly two sports cannot exceed the number of students playing at least one sport.\n\nSo, y \u2264 n.\n\nBut y = 32 - n \u2264 n \u21d2 32 - n \u2264 n \u21d2 n \u2265 16.\n\nBut we already have n \u2265 19, so this doesn't add new information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the maximum possible value for y.\n\nSince y = 32 - n, and y \u2264 n, then 32 - n \u2264 n \u21d2 n \u2265 16.\n\nBut n \u2265 19, so again, no new information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of students playing exactly two sports in relation to the pairwise intersections.\n\nFor example, d = number playing soccer and basketball but not volleyball,\n\ne = number playing soccer and volleyball but not basketball,\n\nf = number playing basketball and volleyball but not soccer.\n\nThen, d + e + f = y = 32 - n.\n\nAlso, from earlier equations:\n\na + d + e = 8, (1)\n\nb + d + f = 6, (2)\n\nc + e + f = 12. (3)\n\nNow, add equations (1), (2), and (3):\n\na + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f = 26.\n\nBut a + b + c = n - d - e - f - 6.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(n - d - e - f - 6) + 2(d + e + f) = 26 \u21d2 n - 6 + d + e + f = 26 \u21d2 n + (d + e + f) = 32.\n\nBut d + e + f = 32 - n.\n\nSubstitute back:\n\nn + (32 - n) = 32 \u21d2 32 = 32, which is always true but doesn't help in finding n.\n\nThis seems to be going in circles again.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider specific values for n within the possible range of 19 to 30 and see which one fits.\n\nLet\u2019s assume n = 19.\n\nThen, y = 32 - 19 = 13,\n\nx = 2*19 - 38 = 0.\n\nSo, x = 0, y = 13, z = 6, and n = 19.\n\nNow, check if these values satisfy the earlier equations.\n\nFrom n = x + y + z = 0 + 13 + 6 = 19, which matches.\n\nTotal participations: x + 2y + 3z = 0 + 2*13 + 3*6 = 0 + 26 + 18 = 44, which matches.\n\nNow, check if the pairwise intersections make sense.\n\nt = |S \u2229 B| + |S \u2229 V| + |B \u2229 V| = 50 - n = 50 - 19 = 31.\n\nBut from n = 44 - t, 19 = 44 - 31, which holds true.\n\nHowever, let's check if the pairwise intersections are possible.\n\nGiven that |S \u2229 B| = d + g = d + 6,\n\n|S \u2229 V| = e + g = e + 6,\n\n|B \u2229 V| = f + g = f + 6.\n\nSo, t = (d + 6) + (e + 6) + (f + 6) = d + e + f + 18 = (32 - n) + 18 = 13 + 18 = 31, which matches t = 31.\n\nNow, from equation (1): a + d + e = 8.\n\nBut x = a = 0, so d + e = 8.\n\nFrom equation (2): b + d + f = 6.\n\nFrom equation (3): c + e + f = 12.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nd + e = 8, (4)\n\nb + d + f = 6, (2)\n\nc + e + f = 12. (3)\n\nAlso, d + e + f = y = 13. (since y = d + e + f = 32 - n = 32 - 19 = 13)\n\nBut from equation (4), d + e = 8, so f = 13 - 8 = 5.\n\nNow, from equation (2): b + d + f = 6 \u21d2 b + d + 5 = 6 \u21d2 b + d = 1.\n\nFrom equation (3): c + e + f = 12 \u21d2 c + e + 5 = 12 \u21d2 c + e = 7.\n\nAlso, from equation (4): d + e = 8.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nd + e = 8, (4)\n\nb + d = 1, (from equation (2))\n\nc + e = 7. (from equation (3))\n\nFrom b + d = 1, and d + e = 8, we can solve for b and e in terms of d.\n\nFrom b + d = 1 \u21d2 b = 1 - d.\n\nFrom d + e = 8 \u21d2 e = 8 - d.\n\nFrom c + e = 7 \u21d2 c = 7 - e = 7 - (8 - d) = -1 + d.\n\nNow, since b and c must be non-negative, we have:\n\nb = 1 - d \u2265 0 \u21d2 d \u2264 1,\n\nc = -1 + d \u2265 0 \u21d2 d \u2265 1.\n\nTherefore, d = 1.\n\nThen, b = 1 - 1 = 0,\n\ne = 8 - 1 = 7,\n\nc = -1 + 1 = 0,\n\nf = 5 (from earlier).\n\nNow, let's check if these values make sense.\n\nWe have:\n\na = 0,\n\nb = 0,\n\nc = 0,\n\nd = 1,\n\ne = 7,\n\nf = 5,\n\ng = 6.\n\nNow, check the total number of students playing at least one sport:\n\nn = a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 19, which matches our assumption.\n\nAlso, check the total participations:\n\na*1 + b*1 + c*1 + d*2 + e*2 + f*2 + g*3 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 14 + 10 + 18 = 44, which matches.\n\nTherefore, with n = 19, all equations are satisfied.\n\nThus, the number of students playing no sports is m = 30 - n = 30 - 19 = 11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11 students don't play any of these sports.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
