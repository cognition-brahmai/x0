        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 10 red balls and 15 blue balls, making a total of 25 balls. I need to find the probability that if I draw 3 balls at random without replacement, exactly 2 of them will be red.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the formula for probability without replacement. Since we're dealing with combinations here, because the order in which I draw the balls doesn't matter.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 25 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of possible outcomes is C(25, 3).\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, which are the scenarios where exactly 2 balls are red. So, I need to choose 2 red balls out of 10 and 1 blue ball out of 15.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 10 is C(10, 2), and the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball from 15 is C(15, 1). Since these are independent events, I multiply them to get the total number of favorable outcomes: C(10, 2) * C(15, 1).\n\nTherefore, the probability P is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nP = [C(10, 2) * C(15, 1)] / C(25, 3)\n\nNow, let's calculate each combination:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45\n\nC(15, 1) = 15! / (1! * 14!) = 15 / 1 = 15\n\nC(25, 3) = 25! / (3! * 22!) = (25 * 24 * 23) / (3 * 2 * 1) = (25 * 24 * 23) / 6\n\nLet's compute that denominator:\n\n25 * 24 = 600\n\n600 * 23 = 13,800\n\n13,800 / 6 = 2,300\n\nSo, C(25, 3) = 2,300\n\nNow, the numerator is C(10, 2) * C(15, 1) = 45 * 15 = 675\n\nTherefore, P = 675 / 2,300\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 25.\n\n675 \u00f7 25 = 27\n\n2,300 \u00f7 25 = 92\n\nSo, P = 27 / 92\n\nTo get a decimal, let's divide 27 by 92.\n\n27 \u00f7 92 \u2248 0.2935\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2935, or 29.35%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, C(10, 2) = 45, that seems correct.\n\nC(15, 1) = 15, that's straightforward.\n\nC(25, 3): Let me recalculate that.\n\n25 * 24 * 23 = 600 * 23 = 13,800\n\n13,800 / 6 = 2,300, yes.\n\nThen, 45 * 15 = 675.\n\n675 / 2,300 = 27 / 92, after simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 25.\n\n27 divided by 92 is indeed approximately 0.2935.\n\nSo, the probability is about 29.35%.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this problem step by step, considering the draws one at a time, without replacement.\n\nFirst draw: Probability of drawing a red ball is 10/25.\n\nSecond draw: If the first was red, probability of drawing another red is 9/24.\n\nThird draw: Probability of drawing a blue ball is 15/23.\n\nBut since the order can vary\u2014red, red, blue or red, blue, red or blue, red, red\u2014I need to account for all possible sequences that result in exactly 2 reds and 1 blue.\n\nSo, the probability for each sequence is:\n\nFirst sequence: Red, Red, Blue\n\nProbability: (10/25) * (9/24) * (15/23)\n\nSecond sequence: Red, Blue, Red\n\nProbability: (10/25) * (15/24) * (9/23)\n\nThird sequence: Blue, Red, Red\n\nProbability: (15/25) * (10/24) * (9/23)\n\nNotice that all these probabilities are equal because multiplication is commutative in this context.\n\nSo, probability for each sequence is:\n\n(10/25) * (9/24) * (15/23)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 10/25 = 2/5\n\nThen, 9/24 = 3/8\n\nThen, 15/23 stays as is.\n\nSo, (2/5) * (3/8) * (15/23) = (2 * 3 * 15) / (5 * 8 * 23) = 90 / 920 = 9/92\n\nWait, but earlier I got 27/92 using combinations. So, what's going on here?\n\nAh, I see. Since there are three different sequences that lead to exactly 2 reds and 1 blue, I need to multiply the probability of one sequence by the number of sequences.\n\nSo, probability for one sequence is 9/92, and there are 3 sequences, so total probability is 3 * (9/92) = 27/92, which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is 27/92, or approximately 29.35%.\n\nI think that makes sense. Probability problems can be tricky, but approaching them from different angles helps to verify the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{27}{92}} \\]"
