        "content": "Sure! To merge two sorted lists into one sorted list in JavaScript, you can use a function that iterates through both lists simultaneously, comparing the smallest elements of each list and pushing the smaller one into a new list. Here's an example implementation:\n\n```javascript\nfunction mergeSortedLists(list1, list2) {\n    let mergedList = [];\n    let i = 0;\n    let j = 0;\n\n    while (i < list1.length && j < list2.length) {\n        if (list1[i] < list2[j]) {\n            mergedList.push(list1[i]);\n            i++;\n        } else {\n            mergedList.push(list2[j]);\n            j++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If there are remaining elements in list1\n    while (i < list1.length) {\n        mergedList.push(list1[i]);\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If there are remaining elements in list2\n    while (j < list2.length) {\n        mergedList.push(list2[j]);\n        j++;\n    }\n\n    return mergedList;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst list1 = [1, 3, 5];\nconst list2 = [2, 4, 6];\nconst merged = mergeSortedLists(list1, list2);\nconsole.log(merged); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We initialize an empty array `mergedList` to store the merged sorted list.\n\n- We use two pointers `i` and `j` to track the current positions in `list1` and `list2`, respectively.\n\n- We iterate through both lists using a `while` loop, comparing the elements at the current positions of the pointers.\n\n- We push the smaller element into `mergedList` and increment the corresponding pointer.\n\n- After the loop, if there are remaining elements in either list, we append them to `mergedList`.\n\n- Finally, we return the `mergedList`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the merged list is sorted because both input lists are already sorted, and we always pick the smallest available element from the two lists at each step."
