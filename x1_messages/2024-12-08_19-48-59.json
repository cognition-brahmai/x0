        "content": "So, I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 8 green balls. So, in total, there are 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 balls in the bag. Got it.\n\nNow, the question is about picking one ball at random without looking and finding the probability that it's either red or blue. Okay, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 20.\n\nThe favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball. There are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, so the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 + 7 = 12.\n\nSo, the probability should be 12/20. But I can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives me 3/5.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the addition rule for probabilities. The addition rule says that the probability of A or B is equal to the probability of A plus the probability of B minus the probability of both A and B happening together.\n\nIn this case, A is picking a red ball, and B is picking a blue ball. Since you can't pick both colors at the same time in a single pick, the probability of both A and B happening together is zero. Therefore, the probability of picking red or blue is just the probability of red plus the probability of blue.\n\nSo, probability of red is 5/20, which is 1/4, and probability of blue is 7/20. Adding those up: 1/4 plus 7/20. To add them, I need a common denominator, which is 20. So, 1/4 is 5/20, plus 7/20 is 12/20, which again simplifies to 3/5.\n\nHmm, that matches what I got earlier. Good, consistent answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the complement. The complement of picking a red or blue ball is picking a green ball. There are 8 green balls out of 20, so the probability of picking green is 8/20, which is 2/5.\n\nSince the probability of all possible outcomes must add up to 1, the probability of picking red or blue is 1 minus the probability of picking green, which is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5. Again, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 3/5 as the probability of picking a red or blue ball.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's any other angle I should consider. Is there any chance that some balls could be of multiple colors or something? No, the problem states clearly that there are 5 red, 7 blue, and 8 green balls, and they're all distinct in color.\n\nAlso, it's specified that the pick is random and without looking, so each ball should have an equal chance of being picked. Therefore, my initial approach should hold.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer. The probability is 3/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
