        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. So, we've got a hotel chain looking to open a new place with up to 150 rooms in a tourist spot. They think they can fill up about 70% of those rooms on average over the year, and they plan to charge $150 per night per room. They've invested $20 million to set this up, and they expect to spend $5 million each year on operating costs. We need to figure out two things: first, what's the expected annual revenue, and second, how many years it will take to recover that initial $20 million investment.\n\nAlright, so starting with the annual revenue. Revenue is basically how much money they bring in before subtracting costs. So, to find that, I need to calculate how much they make from room bookings in a year.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many rooms they're likely to have occupied on average. They have up to 150 rooms, and they expect a 70% occupancy rate. So, the average number of rooms occupied per night would be 150 rooms times 70%, which is:\n\n150 rooms * 0.7 = 105 rooms\n\nSo, on average, 105 rooms are occupied each night.\n\nNext, each room brings in $150 per night. Therefore, the nightly revenue would be:\n\n105 rooms * $150/room = $15,750 per night\n\nNow, to find the annual revenue, we need to multiply the nightly revenue by the number of nights in a year. There are 365 days in a year, so:\n\n$15,750/night * 365 nights/year = $5,733,750 per year\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check those calculations.\n\nStarting again: 150 rooms * 70% occupancy = 105 rooms occupied per night.\n\n105 rooms * $150/room/night = $15,750 per night.\n\n$15,750 per night * 365 nights = $5,733,750 per year.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But maybe I should consider leap years. On average, every four years, there's a leap year with an extra day. But for simplicity, maybe it's fine to use 365 days.\n\nAlright, so expected annual revenue is $5,733,750.\n\nNow, to find out how many years it will take to recover the initial investment of $20 million, considering fixed operating costs of $5 million per year.\n\nFirst, we need to find the annual profit, which is the revenue minus the operating costs.\n\nAnnual profit = Annual revenue - Annual operating costs\n\nSo, $5,733,750 - $5,000,000 = $733,750 per year\n\nNow, to recover the initial investment of $20 million, we divide the investment by the annual profit.\n\n$20,000,000 / $733,750 \u2248 27.24 years\n\nSo, it would take approximately 27.24 years to recover the initial investment based on these projections.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a long time. Maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operating costs include some depreciation or other non-cash expenses. But since it's given as fixed operating costs, I'll assume it's all cash expenses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the room rates or occupancy rates could change over time, but based on the information provided, we have to work with what's given.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the initial investment is a one-time cost, whereas the annual operating costs recur every year.\n\nSo, perhaps a more accurate way is to calculate the net cash flow each year and then find out how many years it takes for the cumulative cash flow to equal or exceed the initial investment.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nEach year, the hotel brings in $5,733,750 in revenue and spends $5,000,000 in operating costs, so the net cash flow per year is $733,750, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, every year, they're adding $733,750 to their cash reserves after covering the operating costs.\n\nTo find out how many years it takes to recover the $20 million investment, we can divide $20,000,000 by $733,750, which gives approximately 27.24 years, as previously calculated.\n\nAlternatively, we could set up an equation where the cumulative cash flow equals the initial investment.\n\nLet\u2019s let n be the number of years.\n\nThen, n * $733,750 = $20,000,000\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn = $20,000,000 / $733,750 \u2248 27.24 years\n\nSo, it confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, it would take about 27 years to recover the initial investment of $20 million with these assumptions.\n\nBut honestly, that seems like a very long payback period. Maybe there's something wrong with the assumptions.\n\nLet me double-check the occupancy rate and room rates.\n\nThey have up to 150 rooms, 70% occupancy, and $150 per night.\n\nIs that reasonable? Well, $150 per night seems a bit low for a hotel, but maybe it's a budget hotel or in a location where that's appropriate.\n\nStill, with 150 rooms at 70% occupancy, bringing in $5,733,750 per year, and subtracting $5 million in operating costs, leaving $733,750 per year, it does seem like it would take a long time to recover $20 million.\n\nPerhaps the operating costs are higher than expected. Maybe they include not just operational expenses but also depreciation or other costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the room rates could be increased, or the occupancy rate could be higher.\n\nBut based on the given numbers, this is the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial investment includes land costs, which might not be fully depreciated over time.\n\nBut again, with the information provided, it seems like a payback period of about 27 years.\n\nIn business terms, that's a very long time, and most investments aim for a payback period of 5 years or less, depending on the industry.\n\nSo, perhaps the hotel chain should reconsider the economics of this project.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other factors not considered here, like additional revenue from restaurants, spas, or other amenities, which could increase the overall revenue.\n\nOr perhaps room rates could be increased during peak seasons.\n\nBut based solely on the information provided, with a payback period of over 27 years, this doesn't seem like a viable investment.\n\nUnless, of course, the hotel expects the property to appreciate in value over time, or there are other benefits not accounted for here.\n\nBut strictly from a cash flow perspective, it would take about 27 years to recover the initial investment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{27.24 \\text{ years}}\\]"
