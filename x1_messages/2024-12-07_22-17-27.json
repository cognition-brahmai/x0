It helps in finding sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: Load a website from the input string (a single link) and produce plain text output containing the content of the link.\nURLCollector[input]: Extract URLs from plain text and produce a newline-delimited response of URLs.\nAIAnswerer[input]: An AI model that answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the population of New York City, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the current Prime Minister of Canada and what are some significant policies they implemented?"
