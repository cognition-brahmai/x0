        "content": "F. Scott Fitzgerald, born Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, was an American novelist, essayist, screenwriter, and short story writer, who is regarded as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. He is known for his works exploring the Jazz Age in America, a period of societal and cultural change in the 1920s.\n\nFitzgerald's most famous work is \"The Great Gatsby,\" published in 1925, which is widely considered to be one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. The novel is a critique of the American Dream and explores themes of love, wealth, and social status through its characters, particularly the enigmatic Jay Gatsby.\n\nAnother notable work is \"Tender Is the Night,\" published in 1934, which delves into the lives of Americans living in France during the 1920s. The novel examines themes of psychiatry, love, and the decay of the American aristocracy.\n\nFitzgerald was part of the Lost Generation, a group of American writers who came to prominence during the 1920s and were defined by their disillusionment following World War I. Other notable members of this group include Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein.\n\nThroughout his career, Fitzgerald also wrote numerous short stories, many of which were published in popular magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post. His works often reflect his own experiences with wealth, fame, and addiction, and provide a vivid portrayal of the Jazz Age and its excesses.\n\nDespite his literary achievements, Fitzgerald struggled with alcoholism and financial difficulties throughout his life. He died in 1940 at the age of 44, but his legacy endures through his enduring works that continue to be studied and admired worldwide."
