        "content": "Let's see. There's a box with red and blue balls, total of 30 balls. The probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, and I need to find out how many blue balls are there.\n\nFirst, I know that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of outcomes. So, in this case, the probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls.\n\nGiven that the probability is 1/3 and the total number of balls is 30, I can set up the equation:\n\nProbability of red ball = Number of red balls / Total number of balls\n\nSo, 1/3 = Number of red balls / 30\n\nTo find the number of red balls, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 30:\n\nNumber of red balls = (1/3) * 30 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 red balls in the box.\n\nNow, since the total number of balls is 30, and there are 10 red balls, the number of blue balls would be:\n\nNumber of blue balls = Total number of balls - Number of red balls = 30 - 10 = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 20 blue balls in the box.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using the probability of picking a blue ball.\n\nWell, the probability of picking a blue ball would be the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls. Since there are only red and blue balls, the probability of picking a blue ball would be 1 minus the probability of picking a red ball.\n\nSo, Probability of blue ball = 1 - Probability of red ball = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\nThen, Probability of blue ball = Number of blue balls / Total number of balls\n\nSo, 2/3 = Number of blue balls / 30\n\nSolving for the number of blue balls:\n\nNumber of blue balls = (2/3) * 30 = 20\n\nAgain, I get 20 blue balls.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the number of blue balls in the box is 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
