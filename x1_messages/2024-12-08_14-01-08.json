        "content": "Let's see. So, in this group, 40% have brown eyes, 30% have green eyes, and the rest have blue eyes. First, I need to figure out what percentage have blue eyes. Since the total has to add up to 100%, I can subtract the percentages of brown and green eyes from 100%.\n\nSo, percentage with blue eyes = 100% - 40% - 30% = 30%.\n\nAlright, so 30% have blue eyes.\n\nNow, the problem says that someone with green eyes leaves the group. I need to find out what percentage of the remaining people have green eyes.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose there are 100 people in the group to make the calculations easier.\n\nSo, initially:\n\n- Brown eyes: 40% of 100 = 40 people\n\n- Green eyes: 30% of 100 = 30 people\n\n- Blue eyes: 30% of 100 = 30 people\n\nTotal = 100 people.\n\nNow, one person with green eyes leaves. So, the number of people with green eyes becomes 30 - 1 = 29.\n\nThe total number of people now is 100 - 1 = 99.\n\nI need to find the new percentage of people with green eyes.\n\nSo, percentage with green eyes = (number with green eyes / total number of people) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (29 / 99) * 100.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 29 divided by 99.\n\nI can calculate it as follows:\n\n99 goes into 29 zero times, so 0.\n\nThen, 99 goes into 290 two times because 99 * 2 = 198.\n\nSubtract 198 from 290: 290 - 198 = 92.\n\nBring down a zero: 920.\n\n99 goes into 920 nine times because 99 * 9 = 891.\n\nSubtract 891 from 920: 920 - 891 = 29.\n\nBring down a zero: 290.\n\nAgain, 99 goes into 290 two times, and so on.\n\nSo, 29 divided by 99 is approximately 0.292929... repeating.\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.292929... * 100 = 29.292929...%.\n\nSo, the percentage of remaining people with green eyes is approximately 29.29%.\n\nBut since I assumed 100 people initially for simplicity, let's check if this holds for a different group size.\n\nSuppose there are 200 people initially.\n\n- Brown eyes: 40% of 200 = 80 people\n\n- Green eyes: 30% of 200 = 60 people\n\n- Blue eyes: 30% of 200 = 60 people\n\nTotal = 200 people.\n\nOne green-eyed person leaves: 60 - 1 = 59 green-eyed people.\n\nTotal people now: 200 - 1 = 199.\n\nPercentage with green eyes: (59 / 199) * 100.\n\nCalculating 59 divided by 199.\n\n199 goes into 59 zero times, so 0.\n\nThen, 199 goes into 590 two times because 199 * 2 = 398.\n\nSubtract 398 from 590: 590 - 398 = 192.\n\nBring down a zero: 1920.\n\n199 goes into 1920 nine times because 199 * 9 = 1791.\n\nSubtract 1791 from 1920: 1920 - 1791 = 129.\n\nBring down a zero: 1290.\n\n199 goes into 1290 six times because 199 * 6 = 1194.\n\nSubtract 1194 from 1290: 1290 - 1194 = 96.\n\nBring down a zero: 960.\n\n199 goes into 960 four times because 199 * 4 = 796.\n\nSubtract 796 from 960: 960 - 796 = 164.\n\nBring down a zero: 1640.\n\n199 goes into 1640 eight times because 199 * 8 = 1592.\n\nSubtract 1592 from 1640: 1640 - 1592 = 48.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, 59 divided by 199 is approximately 0.296482....\n\nMultiply by 100 to get the percentage: 29.6482...%.\n\nWhich is roughly 29.65%.\n\nWait a minute, earlier with 100 people, it was about 29.29%, and with 200 people, it's about 29.65%. That suggests that the percentage changes slightly with different group sizes.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the general case.\n\nLet the total number of people be n.\n\nThen:\n\n- Brown eyes: 0.4n\n\n- Green eyes: 0.3n\n\n- Blue eyes: 0.3n\n\nTotal: n.\n\nOne green-eyed person leaves, so:\n\nGreen eyes: 0.3n - 1\n\nTotal people: n - 1\n\nPercentage of green-eyed people now: [(0.3n - 1) / (n - 1)] * 100\n\nI need to simplify this expression.\n\nLet me calculate this expression for general n.\n\nFirst, (0.3n - 1) / (n - 1).\n\nFactor out 0.3 in the numerator:\n\n0.3n - 1 = 0.3(n - 10/3)\n\nWait, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, divide numerator and denominator by n:\n\n[(0.3n - 1)/n] / [(n - 1)/n] = (0.3 - 1/n) / (1 - 1/n)\n\nNow, as n becomes large, 1/n approaches zero, so the expression approaches 0.3 / 1 = 0.3, or 30%.\n\nBut in our earlier examples with n=100 and n=200, the percentages were around 29.29% and 29.65%, which are less than 30%.\n\nSo, the exact percentage depends on n, but approaches 30% as n increases.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the group size, maybe I need to express the answer in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group is assumed to be large, so that the difference is negligible.\n\nBut in the first case with n=100, it's 29.29%, and with n=200, it's 29.65%, which are not too far from 30%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects an approximate answer of 30%.\n\nBut I think the exact answer depends on n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the change in percentages.\n\nInitially, green eyes are 30%.\n\nWhen one green-eyed person leaves, the number of green-eyed people decreases by 1, and the total number decreases by 1.\n\nSo, the new percentage is (original number of green-eyed people - 1) / (total people - 1).\n\nIn terms of percentages, original green-eyed people are 30% of total.\n\nSo, if I let total people be n, then green-eyed people are 0.3n.\n\nNew percentage = (0.3n - 1) / (n - 1) * 100.\n\nAs n approaches infinity, this approaches 30%.\n\nBut for finite n, it's less than 30%.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be \"less than 30%\", or perhaps to express it in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find an exact percentage without knowing n.\n\nBut from the earlier calculations, it seems dependent on n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the proportion.\n\nInitially, green eyes are 30%.\n\nAfter one green-eyed person leaves, the proportion is (0.3n - 1)/(n - 1).\n\nI can set this equal to a new percentage, say p%.\n\nSo, p = [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100.\n\nI need to solve for p.\n\nBut without knowing n, I can't find a numerical value for p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express p in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the limit or an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the change is negligible for large n, but since the problem doesn't specify n, perhaps I should just assume n is large and say it's approximately 30%.\n\nBut in the earlier examples, even with n=100 and n=200, there's a difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose the group has n people.\n\nGreen-eyed people: 0.3n.\n\nOne green-eyed person leaves, so now green-eyed people: 0.3n - 1.\n\nTotal people now: n - 1.\n\nPercentage of green-eyed people now: [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100.\n\nI can simplify this expression.\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by n:\n\n[(0.3 - 1/n)/(1 - 1/n)] * 100.\n\nAs n approaches infinity, this approaches (0.3 / 1) * 100 = 30%.\n\nBut for finite n, it's less than 30%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can leave it in this form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a specific numerical answer, assuming n=100, like in my first calculation.\n\nIn that case, it would be approximately 29.29%.\n\nBut I think to be general, it's better to express it in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the exact percentage without knowing n.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of proportions.\n\nLet me assume that the group has n people.\n\nThen, green-eyed people: 0.3n.\n\nAfter one leaves, green-eyed people: 0.3n - 1.\n\nTotal people: n - 1.\n\nSo, the new percentage is p = [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100.\n\nI can solve for p.\n\nBut I still have n in the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express p in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eliminate n.\n\nLet me try to solve for p in terms of n.\n\np = [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100.\n\nLet me divide both sides by 100:\n\np/100 = (0.3n - 1)/(n - 1).\n\nNow, cross-multiplying:\n\np(n - 1) = 100(0.3n - 1).\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\np*n - p = 30n - 100.\n\nBringing like terms together:\n\np*n - 30n = -100 + p.\n\nFactor n:\n\nn(p - 30) = p - 100.\n\nNow, solving for n:\n\nn = (p - 100)/(p - 30).\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express p in terms of n.\n\nBut this seems too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of ratios.\n\nInitially, green eyes are 30% of the group.\n\nOne green-eyed person leaves, so the number of green-eyed people decreases by 1, and total people decrease by 1.\n\nI need to find the new percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a weightage problem.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the difference in percentages.\n\nInitially, green eyes are 30%.\n\nAfter one green-eyed person leaves, the percentage decreases by some amount.\n\nBut I don't know how to quantify that without knowing n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the percentage change.\n\nBut again, that seems dependent on n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nMaybe I should just stick with the initial approach of assuming n=100 for simplicity.\n\nSo, with n=100:\n\n- Green-eyed people: 30\n\n- Total people: 100\n\nOne green-eyed person leaves:\n\n- Green-eyed people: 29\n\n- Total people: 99\n\nNew percentage: (29/99)*100 \u2248 29.29%\n\nAlternatively, with n=200:\n\n- Green-eyed people: 60\n\n- Total people: 200\n\nOne green-eyed person leaves:\n\n- Green-eyed people: 59\n\n- Total people: 199\n\nNew percentage: (59/199)*100 \u2248 29.65%\n\nSo, as n increases, the new percentage approaches 30%.\n\nBut with n=100, it's 29.29%, which is slightly less.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for larger groups, the effect of one person leaving is less significant.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify n, maybe I should express the answer in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be \"still 30%\", but that doesn't seem accurate, as the calculations show it's slightly less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"In a group of people, 40% have brown eyes, 30% have green eyes, and the rest have blue eyes. If someone with green eyes leaves the group, what percentage of the remaining people have green eyes?\"\n\nSo, the group initially has certain percentages, and one green-eyed person leaves, and I need to find the new percentage of green-eyed people.\n\nGiven that, and my calculations showing it depends on n, perhaps the problem expects an expression in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of proportions rather than absolute numbers.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nInitially, green eyes are 30% of the group.\n\nOne green-eyed person leaves, which is 1 person out of n, where n is the total number of people.\n\nSo, the change in the number of green-eyed people is -1, and the change in total people is -1.\n\nSo, the new proportion is (0.3n - 1)/(n - 1).\n\nI can't simplify this further without knowing n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the proportionate change.\n\nThe proportion of green-eyed people initially is 0.3.\n\nAfter one leaves, it's (0.3n - 1)/(n - 1).\n\nI can divide numerator and denominator by n:\n\n(0.3 - 1/n)/(1 - 1/n).\n\nAs n becomes large, this approaches 0.3/1 = 0.3, or 30%.\n\nBut for finite n, it's less than 30%.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is \"slightly less than 30%\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find an exact percentage without knowing n.\n\nBut from my earlier calculations with n=100 and n=200, the percentages are different.\n\nSo, it does depend on n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be expressed in terms of n.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as the problem is phrased to expect a percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as the percentage remaining the same, but that doesn't make sense because it changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to test understanding of percentages and how they change with additions or subtractions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to express the new percentage in terms of n, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for this kind of problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the percentage change is negligible if n is large.\n\nBut since n is not specified, perhaps the answer should be expressed in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that the percentage decreases slightly.\n\nBut I think providing a numerical answer is expected.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should provide the expression [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100 as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to find a numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the percentage decreases by approximately 1/n.\n\nBut that's not precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the change in percentage is (old percentage - (100/n)).\n\nBut that doesn't seem accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use calculus to approximate the change, but that seems overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for large n, the percentage remains approximately 30%.\n\nBut as n decreases, the percentage decreases more significantly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to express it as \"approximately 30%, but slightly less\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be calculated assuming n=100, as I did earlier.\n\nIn that case, it's approximately 29.29%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a general expression.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is:\n\nThe new percentage of green-eyed people is [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100%, where n is the initial number of people in the group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express this without n.\n\nBut I don't see a way to eliminate n without additional information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that without knowing n, the exact percentage cannot be determined.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that the percentage depends on the initial group size.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be \"still 30%\", but that doesn't seem correct based on the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to understand that removing one person changes the percentage slightly.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best answer is to express the new percentage as [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100%, where n is the initial number of people.\n\nAlternatively, if an approximate numerical answer is expected, perhaps \"approximately 29.3%\".\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify n, it's hard to give a precise numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem that I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of proportions.\n\nLet me assume that the group has n people.\n\nThen, green-eyed people: 0.3n.\n\nAfter one leaves, green-eyed people: 0.3n - 1.\n\nTotal people: n - 1.\n\nSo, the new proportion is (0.3n - 1)/(n - 1).\n\nI can set this equal to p, the new percentage.\n\nSo, p = [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100.\n\nI can solve for p in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express p in terms of n.\n\nBut without knowing n, I can't find a numerical value for p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find p without knowing n.\n\nBut it seems that p depends on n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be expressed in terms of n, as I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for this type of problem that I'm not recalling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the percentage change is proportional to the reciprocal of n.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for large n, p is approximately 30%, and for small n, p is less than 30%.\n\nBut without knowing n, I can't give a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that removing one green-eyed person decreases the percentage of green-eyed people.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is \"less than 30%\".\n\nBut I think a more precise answer is expected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to set up an equation to solve for p in terms of n.\n\nBut again, without knowing n, that seems incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the new percentage in terms of the original percentages without referring to n.\n\nBut I don't see how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the proportion of green-eyed people after one leaves.\n\nLet me denote the initial number of people as n.\n\nThen, green-eyed people initially: 0.3n.\n\nAfter one leaves: 0.3n - 1.\n\nTotal people after one leaves: n - 1.\n\nSo, the new proportion is (0.3n - 1)/(n - 1).\n\nI can divide numerator and denominator by n:\n\n(0.3 - 1/n)/(1 - 1/n).\n\nAs n approaches infinity, this approaches 0.3/1 = 0.3, or 30%.\n\nFor finite n, it's less than 30%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the change in proportion is approximately -1/n.\n\nBut that's not precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider a small n and see the pattern.\n\nSuppose n=10.\n\nThen, green-eyed people: 3.\n\nTotal people: 10.\n\nOne green-eyed person leaves: green-eyed people now 2.\n\nTotal people: 9.\n\nPercentage: (2/9)*100 \u2248 22.22%.\n\nSimilarly, with n=100: (29/99)*100 \u2248 29.29%.\n\nWith n=200: (59/199)*100 \u2248 29.65%.\n\nWith n=1000: (299/999)*100 \u2248 29.93%.\n\nSo, as n increases, the new percentage approaches 30%.\n\nGiven that, for large n, it's approximately 30%, but for smaller n, it's less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be \"approximately 30%\".\n\nBut I think that's an approximation, and a more precise answer would be to express it in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that the percentage decreases by a certain amount, which depends on n.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to express the new percentage as [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find an exact numerical value without knowing n.\n\nBut from the calculations, it seems dependent on n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to understand that removing one person from a group changes the percentages slightly, and to express that understanding.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to explain that the new percentage of green-eyed people is slightly less than 30%, and approaches 30% as the group size increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a specific numerical answer based on assuming n=100.\n\nIn that case, as calculated earlier, it's approximately 29.29%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to set up the expression and leave it in terms of n.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best answer is:\n\nThe new percentage of green-eyed people is approximately 30%, but slightly less, depending on the initial group size. For a group of size n, the exact percentage is [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100%.\n\nAlternatively, if a numerical answer is expected, perhaps \"approximately 29.3%\".\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify n, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that without knowing n, the exact percentage cannot be determined.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that the percentage depends on the initial group size.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be \"29.29%\" assuming n=100.\n\nBut since n isn't specified, that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to understand that the percentage decreases by about 0.71% when one green-eyed person leaves from a group of 100.\n\nBut again, n isn't specified.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best answer is to express the new percentage in terms of n: [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100%.\n\nAlternatively, if a numerical approximation is acceptable, \"approximately 29.3%\".\n\nBut I think expressing it in terms of n is more precise and general.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that the percentage remains 30%, but that seems incorrect based on the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach that I'm missing.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider that the percentage doesn't change significantly for large n, but changes more for small n.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is \"approximately 30%\", with the understanding that it's slightly less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be \"29.29%\" based on assuming n=100.\n\nBut since n isn't specified, that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to set up the expression and leave it in terms of n.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best answer is:\n\nThe new percentage of green-eyed people is [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100%, where n is the initial number of people in the group.\n\nAlternatively, for a general group size, it's approximately 30%, but slightly less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to recognize that the percentage decreases to approximately 29.29% assuming n=100.\n\nBut since n isn't specified, that might not be accurate.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to express it in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to understand that the percentage changes based on the group size and to express that relationship.\n\nGiven all that, I think the answer is that the new percentage of green-eyed people is [(0.3n - 1)/(n - 1)] * 100%, where n is the initial number of people in the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{0.3n - 1}{n - 1} \\times 100\\%}"
