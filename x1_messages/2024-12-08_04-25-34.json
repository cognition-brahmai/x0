It was invented by Hungarian architect Ern\u0151 Rubik in 1974 and consists of a 3x3 cube with colored squares that need to be aligned correctly. The cube has six faces, each covered by nine stickers of one of six solid colors (traditionally white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow). The goal is to solve the puzzle by twisting and turning the cube's layers until each face is a single, solid color."
