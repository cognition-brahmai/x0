        "content": "Let's see... this riddle is talking about something that appears in both art and nature, like in shells and flowers. And it grows by a specific sequence where each number is the sum of the two before it. Hmm, that sounds familiar.\n\nSo, the sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones\u2014 that's the Fibonacci sequence, right? Let me recall: starting with 0 and 1, then it goes 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. Yeah, that's it.\n\nNow, the riddle mentions that this pattern is seen in shells and flowers. I think of the nautilus shell, which grows in a spiral that follows the Fibonacci sequence. And in flowers, the number of petals often follows Fibonacci numbers; for example, lilies have three petals, buttercups have five, delphiniums have eight, and so on.\n\nIn art, the Fibonacci sequence is related to the golden ratio, which has been used by artists and architects for centuries to create aesthetically pleasing compositions. So, that fits the \"art\" part.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer to the riddle is the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there anything else that appears in both art and nature, follows a similar growth pattern?\n\nWell, maybe the golden ratio itself, since it's derived from the Fibonacci sequence. The golden ratio is approximately 1.618 and is found in various natural phenomena and has been used in art and architecture.\n\nHowever, the riddle specifically mentions a sequence where each number is the sum of the two before, which is the defining characteristic of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSo, I think the most accurate answer is the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Fibonacci sequence}} \\]"
