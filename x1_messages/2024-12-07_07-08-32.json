        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. I have a bag with 20 marbles: 10 are red, and the rest are blue. So, the rest would be 20 minus 10, which is 10 blue marbles. Got it.\n\nNow, I need to draw three marbles without looking, and I want to find the probability that exactly two of them are red. Okay, so it's about finding the chance of getting exactly two red marbles out of three draws.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how to calculate probabilities in situations like this. Since it's about drawing marbles without replacement (I assume), meaning once I draw a marble, it stays out of the bag, and doesn't go back in. So, this is a scenario of dependent events, where each draw affects the next one.\n\nI think the formula for probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to get exactly two red marbles and one blue marble in three draws.\n\nTo find the total number of possible ways to draw three marbles out of 20, I should use combinations, not permutations, because the order doesn't matter here. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, and permutations are for when it does.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 20 is \"20 choose 3.\" I remember that the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, total possible outcomes = C(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20 - 3)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1140 / 6 = 1140 ways. Wait, no, 1140 divided by 6 is 190. So, there are 190 possible ways to draw 3 marbles out of 20.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, I need exactly two red marbles and one blue marble. So, I need to find the number of ways to choose 2 red marbles out of 10 and 1 blue marble out of 10.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 red marbles out of 10 is C(10, 2), and the number of ways to choose 1 blue marble out of 10 is C(10, 1).\n\nCalculating these:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nC(10, 1) = 10! / (1!(10 - 1)!) = 10 / 1 = 10.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 45 (for two reds) multiplied by 10 (for one blue), which is 450.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 450 / 190.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. 450 divided by 190 is more than 1, which can't be a probability because probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 20 is C(20, 3). Let's calculate that again:\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20 - 3)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 6840 / 6 = 1140 / 6 = wait, 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18 is 6840, divided by 6 is indeed 1140. But earlier I thought it was 190, which was wrong. So, total outcomes are 1140, not 190.\n\nOh! That's where I went wrong. So, total outcomes are 1140, not 190.\n\nLet me correct that. C(20, 3) = 20! / (3! \u00d7 17!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 6840 / 6 = 1140.\n\nYes, so total outcomes are 1140.\n\nNow, favorable outcomes are C(10, 2) \u00d7 C(10, 1) = 45 \u00d7 10 = 450.\n\nTherefore, probability = 450 / 1140.\n\nNow, simplifying that fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 30.\n\n450 \u00f7 30 = 15, and 1140 \u00f7 30 = 38.\n\nSo, 15/38.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 15/38.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a better sense of it. 15 divided by 38 is approximately 0.3947, or about 39.47%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 39.47% chance of drawing exactly two red marbles and one blue marble when drawing three marbles from the bag.\n\nWait a second, let me verify if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using probabilities step by step, considering the draws one by one.\n\nOkay, so alternatively, I can think of the probability of drawing two red marbles and one blue marble in any order.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw is 10/20, since there are 10 red marbles out of 20.\n\nThen, given that the first marble was red, the probability of drawing another red marble is 9/19, because now there are 9 red marbles left out of 19 total marbles.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a blue marble on the third draw is 10/18, since there are 10 blue marbles left out of 18 total marbles.\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence: red, red, blue is (10/20) \u00d7 (9/19) \u00d7 (10/18).\n\nCalculating that: (10/20) = 1/2, (9/19) stays as is, (10/18) = 5/9.\n\nSo, (1/2) \u00d7 (9/19) \u00d7 (5/9) = (1 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 9) = 45 / 342.\n\nSimplifying 45/342 by dividing numerator and denominator by 9: 5/38.\n\nWait, but earlier I got 15/38 using combinations. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, maybe because this is just one specific order: red, red, blue. But there are other orders in which two reds and one blue can be drawn: red, blue, red; blue, red, red.\n\nSo, in total, there are three distinct sequences that result in two reds and one blue: RRB, RBR, BRR.\n\nEach of these sequences will have the same probability, since the probabilities of drawing red or blue depend only on the current counts, not on the order.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 3 times the probability of any one of these sequences.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 (5/38) = 15/38.\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier result obtained using combinations.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the probability is 15/38.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for hypergeometric distribution, since this is a problem of sampling without replacement from a finite population.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) \u00d7 C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (20 marbles)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (10 red marbles)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 marbles)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red marbles)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = [C(10, 2) \u00d7 C(10, 1)] / C(20, 3) = (45 \u00d7 10) / 1140 = 450 / 1140 = 15/38\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer: 15/38.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing exactly two red marbles and one blue marble when drawing three marbles from a bag containing 10 red and 10 blue marbles is 15/38.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{38}} \\]"
