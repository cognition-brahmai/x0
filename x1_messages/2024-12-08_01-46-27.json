        "content": "So I've got this problem here: There are 10 people in a room, each with an envelope bearing their name. They're supposed to randomly pick one envelope from the pile without peeking at the names. I need to find out the probability that none of them ends up with their own envelope. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the total number of possible ways the envelopes can be distributed. Since there are 10 people and 10 envelopes, each person can pick any of the 10 envelopes. But wait, once an envelope is picked, it's removed from the pile, so the next person has one less envelope to choose from. So, the total number of ways to distribute the envelopes is simply the number of permutations of 10 distinct items, which is 10 factorial, or 10!.\n\nSo, total number of possible distributions = 10! (which is 3,628,800).\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways in which no one gets their own envelope. This sounds like a classic problem in combinatorics known as derangements. A derangement is a permutation where none of the elements appear in their original positions. So, in this case, I need to find the number of derangements for 10 items, denoted as !10.\n\nThe formula for the number of derangements of n objects is:\n\n!n = n! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n/n!)\n\nSo, for n = 10, it would be:\n\n!10 = 10! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + 1/4! - 1/5! + 1/6! - 1/7! + 1/8! - 1/9! + 1/10!)\n\nI can calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 10!:\n\n10! = 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 3,628,800\n\nNow, calculate the series:\n\n(1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + 1/4! - 1/5! + 1/6! - 1/7! + 1/8! - 1/9! + 1/10!)\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n1 = 1\n\n-1/1! = -1/1 = -1\n\n+1/2! = 1/2 = 0.5\n\n-1/3! = -1/6 \u2248 -0.1667\n\n+1/4! = 1/24 \u2248 0.0417\n\n-1/5! = -1/120 \u2248 -0.0083\n\n+1/6! = 1/720 \u2248 0.0014\n\n-1/7! = -1/5040 \u2248 -0.0002\n\n+1/8! = 1/40320 \u2248 0.000025\n\n-1/9! = -1/362880 \u2248 -0.00000275\n\n+1/10! = 1/3628800 \u2248 0.000000275\n\nNow, summing these up:\n\n1 - 1 + 0.5 - 0.1667 + 0.0417 - 0.0083 + 0.0014 - 0.0002 + 0.000025 - 0.00000275 + 0.000000275\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1 - 1 = 0\n\n0 + 0.5 = 0.5\n\n0.5 - 0.1667 \u2248 0.3333\n\n0.3333 + 0.0417 \u2248 0.375\n\n0.375 - 0.0083 \u2248 0.3667\n\n0.3667 + 0.0014 \u2248 0.3681\n\n0.3681 - 0.0002 \u2248 0.3679\n\n0.3679 + 0.000025 \u2248 0.367925\n\n0.367925 - 0.00000275 \u2248 0.36792225\n\n0.36792225 + 0.000000275 \u2248 0.367922525\n\nSo, the sum of the series is approximately 0.367922525.\n\nTherefore, the number of derangements !10 is:\n\n!10 \u2248 3,628,800 \u00d7 0.367922525 \u2248 1,334,961\n\nNow, the probability that no one gets their own envelope is the number of derangements divided by the total number of permutations:\n\nProbability = !10 / 10! \u2248 1,334,961 / 3,628,800 \u2248 0.3679\n\nI know that as n gets larger, the probability of a derangement approaches 1/e, where e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.71828. Since 1/e is approximately 0.367879, and our calculated probability is approximately 0.3679, which matches well.\n\nSo, the probability that none of the 10 people gets their own envelope is approximately 0.3679, or 36.79%.\n\nAlternatively, I could express this probability as a fraction. Since !n is approximately n!/e, then !10 \u2248 10!/e, so the probability is approximately 1/e.\n\nBut for exact value, I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle that derangements formula is based on.\n\nAlternatively, there's a recursive formula for derangements:\n\n!n = (n - 1) * (!(n - 1) + !(n - 2))\n\nWith base cases:\n\n!0 = 1\n\n!1 = 0\n\nI could use this to calculate !10 exactly.\n\nLet's compute !n for n from 2 to 10 using this formula.\n\n!0 = 1\n\n!1 = 0\n\n!2 = 1 * (0 + 1) = 1\n\n!3 = 2 * (1 + 0) = 2\n\n!4 = 3 * (2 + 1) = 9\n\n!5 = 4 * (9 + 2) = 44\n\n!6 = 5 * (44 + 9) = 265\n\n!7 = 6 * (265 + 44) = 1,854\n\n!8 = 7 * (1,854 + 265) = 14,835\n\n!9 = 8 * (14,835 + 1,854) = 133,496\n\n!10 = 9 * (133,496 + 14,835) = 9 * 148,331 = 1,334,979\n\nWait, but earlier I approximated !10 as 1,334,961, which is close to this exact value of 1,334,979.\n\nNow, using the exact value:\n\nProbability = !10 / 10! = 1,334,979 / 3,628,800\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nLet's divide numerator and denominator by 9:\n\n1,334,979 \u00f7 9 = 148,331\n\n3,628,800 \u00f7 9 = 403,200\n\nSo, 148,331 / 403,200\n\nThis fraction seems irreducible, as 148,331 is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the exact probability is 148,331 / 403,200.\n\nAlternatively, as a decimal, this is approximately 0.367879, which is very close to 1/e (approximately 0.367879441).\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.3679, or 36.79%.\n\nAlternatively, in percentage terms, it's about 36.79%.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that for a large number of people, the probability approaches 1/e, which is about 36.7879%.\n\nSo, for 10 people, it's a pretty good approximation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 0.3679, or 36.79%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.3679} \\]"
