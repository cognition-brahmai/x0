        "content": "Let's tackle this age problem step by step. So, we have John and his sister Mary, and we're trying to figure out their current ages based on some relationships given in the problem.\n\nFirst, it says that John is twice as old as his sister Mary. Let's assign some variables to their ages to make this easier. Let\u2019s say Mary\u2019s current age is M years. That means John\u2019s current age would be 2M years, since he\u2019s twice as old as Mary.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem says that in 10 years, John will be three times as old as Mary was 5 years ago. Hmm, that\u2019s a bit more complicated. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nIn 10 years, John\u2019s age will be his current age plus 10, so that\u2019s 2M + 10.\n\nMary\u2019s age 5 years ago was her current age minus 5, which is M - 5.\n\nAccording to the problem, John\u2019s age in 10 years is three times Mary\u2019s age 5 years ago. So, we can write that as:\n\n2M + 10 = 3(M - 5)\n\nOkay, now we have an equation that we can solve for M.\n\nLet\u2019s expand the right side: 3(M - 5) = 3M - 15.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2M + 10 = 3M - 15\n\nNow, let\u2019s get all the M terms on one side and the constants on the other side.\n\nSubtract 2M from both sides:\n\n10 = M - 15\n\nNow, add 15 to both sides:\n\n25 = M\n\nSo, Mary is currently 25 years old.\n\nSince John is twice as old as Mary, John is 2 * 25 = 50 years old.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if this makes sense with the second condition.\n\nIn 10 years, John will be 50 + 10 = 60 years old.\n\nMary\u2019s age 5 years ago was 25 - 5 = 20 years old.\n\nThree times Mary\u2019s age 5 years ago would be 3 * 20 = 60, which matches John\u2019s age in 10 years.\n\nPerfect, it all checks out.\n\nSo, John is currently 50 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
