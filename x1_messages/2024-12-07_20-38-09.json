The scene of Tucson\\'s horrific shooting getting back to business, but people are also getting a chance to pay respects to those shot during last week\\'s attack. We\\'re there with a preview of this morning\\'s emotional ceremony and plans to hold a gun show today just a short distance away. And in Tunisia reports of a revolution getting bloodier and nastier each hour. More than 40 people are killed when a prison is set afire. The president has fled and unclear who is in charge. The latest inside the country and chaos. From the CNN center, this is CNN SATURDAY morning. Good morning to you. I\\'m Martin Savidge, thanks very much for being with us. Also coming up this hour, surprising revelations from Ronald Reagan Junior\\'s new book, raised the revelation that president Reagan\\'s Alzheimer\\'s may have been evident before he left office. Who knew about the health crisis and when? Detroit thinks American drivers are finally ready to commit to electric cars. Before you buy, we will answer the most common question to decide if the cars are worth the steep price tag. But we start this morning with a solemn ceremony in Tucson, Arizona. This was unlike any supermarket opening you have seen in the past, talking about that safe way in Tucson that served as the backdrop to last week\\'s deadly shooting. Thelma Gutierrez is there for us this morning. And Thelma, did they do anything special to honor the victims? I imagine, of course, they did. THELMA GUTIERREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Martin, coming up in about two hours, they will hold a moment of silence here in the Safeway store. They\\'re going to announce it over the pa. They will stand out here at this memorial you see at the front door and they will remember the victims of last week\\'s shooting. What was really interesting, Martin, is that when those doors opened about an hour ago, three employees walked in. They had their arms around each other. I talked to them a short time ago, and they said they still can\\'t get over what they heard, what they saw, just seven days ago right out here where I\\'m standing. They said it was just a terrible, terrible thing. They said it\\'s time to get back to normal, get back to work for the first time in seven days. At the same time, they say, very, very difficult to get over those emotions, over those sights and sounds that they heard. SAVIDGE: I understand it would be. Our heart very much goes out to them. I\\'m wondering, I understand there is a gun show getting under way nearby. Of course, it\\'s legal. But I\\'m wondering what people are saying about it? GUTIERREZ: Well, it\\'s interesting, because right after this massacre occurred, the gun show has been in the making for quite a while. It\\'s been planned, a scheduled event. But after the massacre, the organizers came under a good amount of criticism, people wondering whether or not the timing was appropriate to have such a show. The organizers say they plan to move forward. Thousands of people expected today to come to that gun show, to go buy firearms, this kind of thing. And so once again, this massacre has reignited that national debate on gun control, and Tucson has become ground zero. GUTIERREZ: At this firing range in Tucson, Arizona, nearly every lane is full with couples and firearms enthusiasts, like Jim Coniglio, who says he\\'s proud to live in a state where he can carry a concealed weapon on his person and in his vehicle with no permit at all. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are citizens, not subjects. That\\'s the bottom line. GUTIERREZ: The law is called \"constitutional carry,\" a new law that just passed last year. SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK, PIMA COUNTY, ARIZONA: I think we\\'re the Tombstone of the United States of America. GUTIERREZ: After the massacre in Tucson, the sheriff of Pima County says things are out of control. He cited proposed legislation which would allow students 21 and over to carry guns on campus. DUPNIK: I have never been a proponent of letting everybody in this state carry weapons under any circumstances that they want. That\\'s almost where we are. JOE ZAMUDIO, WITNESS: I carry -- it\\'s -- this is a Ruger P95. GUTIERREZ: And 24-year-old Joe Zamudio says he carries a concealed weapon to feel safe. GUTIERREZ (on camera): So this is something that you carry with you where, the store? ZAMUDIO: Pretty much everywhere I go. GUTIERREZ (voice-over): Last Saturday was no different. Joe said he had his firearm in his jacket when he went to buy cigarettes. ZAMUDIO: I heard the shots from inside the building. When in turned and squared my shoulders to the breezeway, I saw another gentleman with his right hand lifting the firearm like this only it was locked back. And he brings it around his side. That, to me, he was standing, he was holding a gun. GUTIERREZ: Joe saw victims in pools of blood. He had to make a split second decision about his gun with no room for errors. ZAMUDIO: He needed to be taken care of was my immediate problem, address that firearm. GUTIERREZ: Instead of his gun, which he says he was prepared to use for a moment just like this, Joe reached for the man\\'s wrist instead. GUTIERREZ (on camera): Did he say anything? Did he say, I\\'m not the shooter? ZAMUDIO: Immediately. No, it\\'s him. It\\'s him. GUTIERREZ (voice-over): Joe saw Jared Loughner on the ground. Turns out the man with the gun had disarmed Loughner. ZAMUDIO: I\\'m just so lucky. I\\'m just so lucky. We were all blessed he had been there that day. If he hadn\\'t been there, I might not be here right now. I might have gotten shot and gone out that door and got my head blown off. GUTIERREZ (on camera): Does that go through your mind? ZAMUDIO: Yes. GUTIERREZ: Has it affected your life? ZAMUDIO: It\\'s been horrible, one of the worst thing that ever happened. GUTIERREZ (voice-over): Joe believes the gun training that made him an able marksman also helped him to make a sound judgment call. ZAMUDIO: There was a bunch of people watching and all those people watching see me pull a gun out thinks second shooter. And in Arizona, where people keep guns in their cars, somebody could have shot me. GUTIERREZ: Joe says the reality of that is just now starting to set in on him. He says he\\'s having such a tough time dealing with what he witnessed, with what he went through here in Tucson, that he actually left town last night to just get away from things for a while. Martin? SAVIDGE: An amazingly powerful story, Thelma. Thank you very much for bringing it to us. One of the victims in the shooting was federal Judge John Roll. He was laid to rest yesterday. Mourners packed the Tucson church to say their final good-byes. Roll grew up in Tucson. Former Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O\\'Connor was among the mourners and three of his grandchildren spoke at his service. Then nine-year-old Christina green laid to rest Thursday. Our Susan Candiotti spoke to Christina\\'s father yesterday, and he told Susan that some of Christina\\'s organs were donated to a little girl in Boston. He also said he and his wife would like to meet that little girl one day without a doubt. Makes perfect sense, they would love to give her a big hug. Among those wounded were Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her aid, Pam Simon. Giffords remains in the hospital and her doctors say she\\'s progressing as well as can be hoped. Simon was released on Thursday. Here\\'s a picture of Pam Simon with President Obama during his visit Wednesday, and our Randi Kaye sat down with her to talk about the tragedy. RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Do you remember when that shot was fired at the congresswoman? PAM SIMON, AIDE TO REP. GIFFORDS: It happened, everything happened probably in a matter of seconds. My feeling is that he was whirling his back was to me. I saw the congresswoman go down, I saw Ron go down. And then I think I must have been one of the next people hit, because from that point on, I was laying on the ground. KAYE: Did you ever actually see the gunman\\'s face? SIMON: No, no, I did not. KAYE: What was that moment like for you, when you knew you had been shot? SIMON: It took a few seconds to actually, for the reality. I think I was on the ground before I thought this is actually happening. KAYE: Were you scared? Did you understand what had happened? SIMON: I don\\'t remember the emotion of fear at all, I just remembered kind of survival instincts kicking in. I laid very still and played dead. I didn\\'t know if he was still around. SAVIDGE: Simon was shot twice, once in the wrist and once in the chest. That bullet, by the way, traveled through her body and is now lodged in her thigh. We\\'ll have more of this interview later this hour. Startling changes in the African nation of Tunisia. Tunisia\\'s parliament speaker says he is acting as interim president today. Yesterday Tunisia\\'s president fled the country amid over discontent over economic conditions and rampant corruption in government. And there are reports today of fires of several prisons across Tunisia. At least 42 inmates killed at just one of those prisons. The nation says -- senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman, rather, is descending into chaos. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Walking around the capitol this morning, it\\'s clear the army is firmly in control. I watched overnight from my hotel window as young protesters were rounded up by the army and plain-clothed policemen. They were beaten and kicked and hauled away to who knows where. It may have started off as a popular movement but it looks like it may be ending in a military coup d\\'etat. SAVIDGE: The capital city remains under a nighttime curfew. Now to southern India where a stampede has killed at least 100 people. The stampeded apparently started when a truck overturned into a group of people along a narrow stretch near the temple. Michael Steele is out as chairman of the Republican National Committee. He was plagued by controversy and criticism even though he presided over the retaking of the House. Wisconsin GOP chairman Reince Priebus was elected as the new chairman. REINCE PREIBUS, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: With the election over, now is the time for the committee to unite. We must come together for our common interests, for the betterment of our party and our country. With that in mind, I want you to know that I am here to earn the trust and support of each and every one of you. I told you I would serve in humility and work hard and I\\'m going to start working right now as your chairman. SAVIDGE: And first on the agenda will be to raise money for that 2012 election. In other political news, Ron Reagan, he now says his father may have been showing signs of Alzheimer\\'s disease as early as his first term. He makes the connection in a new book saying he had first the first shivers of concern three years into Ronald Reagan\\'s presidency. He says he believes his father would have stepped down if he had been diagnosed while in office. President Reagan disclosed he had Alzheimer\\'s in 1994, five years after leaving office. That so-called virtual fence along the U.S. Mexico border, well, it\\'s being scrapped. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano cited technical delays as reasons to end the project. It cost $1 billion to cover just 53 miles of the 2,000 mile border. The network of cameras and sensors already in place will take advantage of unmanned drones and thermal imaging devices. Zsa Zsa Gabor has lost her right leg to infection. The 93-year- old actress developed a lesion on her leg that turned out to be resistant to drugs. The husband said he didn\\'t tell Zsa Zsa about the amputation before the surgery. Doctors are guarded about her recovery. So what did Jared Loughner do in the hours before the shooting at the Tucson Safeway? We have the minute by minute breakdown, what police said he did before that horrifying event.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
