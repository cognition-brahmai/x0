        "content": "To address the user's request to \"Filter out emails from john.doe@example.com received in 2021,\" I need to select the most appropriate function from the provided options: `search`, `email_filter`, and `csv_analytics`. Given the specific nature of the request, which involves filtering emails based on sender and date criteria, the `email_filter` function seems to be the most directly applicable.\n\n### Analysis of Functions\n\n1. **search**:\n   - **Description**: Converts the user's query into search terms and filters to help locate information.\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `search_terms`: High-importance keywords/phrases from the user's query.\n     - `alternatives`: Alternative high-importance keywords/phrases that are variations of the actual input keywords/phrases.\n     - `date_range`: Includes `begin` and `end` to limit results by date.\n   - This function is more general and seems geared towards searching for information using keywords and date ranges, but it doesn't specifically mention filtering emails.\n\n2. **email_filter**:\n   - **Description**: Filters emails based on certain criteria.\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `email_address`: The email address to filter for.\n     - `date_range`: Includes `start_date` and `end_date` to restrict results by date.\n   - This function is specifically designed for filtering emails based on sender's email address and date range, which aligns perfectly with the user's request.\n\n3. **csv_analytics**:\n   - **Description**: Performs various operations like aggregation, counting, etc. on CSV data.\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `action`: The desired operation on the data, e.g., \"count\", \"filter\", \"grouped_count\".\n     - `filters`: Includes `column`, `value`, and `expression` for filtering data.\n   - This function is geared towards analyzing CSV data and may not be directly applicable to filtering emails unless the emails are represented in a CSV format, which is not specified in the user's input.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that the `email_filter` function is specifically designed for filtering emails based on sender's email address and date range, it is the most suitable choice for fulfilling the user's request. The `search` function, while versatile, is more general and doesn't explicitly support email filtering, and `csv_analytics` is geared towards data analysis rather than email filtering.\n\n### Parameters\n\nTo use the `email_filter` function effectively, I need to specify the `email_address` and the `date_range` parameters appropriately.\n\n- **email_address**: The user specified \"john.doe@example.com,\" so this should be directly used as the value for `email_address`.\n- **date_range**:\n  - **start_date**: The user wants emails received in 2021. To capture all emails from the start of 2021, set `start_date` to \"2021-01-01\".\n  - **end_date**: To include all emails up to the end of 2021, set `end_date` to \"2021-12-31\".\n\n### Final YAML Response\n\n```yaml\nfunction: email_filter\nparams:\n  email_address: john.doe@example.com\n  date_range:\n    start_date: 2021-01-01\n    end_date: 2021-12-31\n```\n\nThis response directly addresses the user's request by selecting the most appropriate function and configuring it with the necessary parameters to filter emails from the specified sender within the specified year.\n"
