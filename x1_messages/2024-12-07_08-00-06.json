        "content": "So I've got this math problem to solve: ((4 + 6)^2 - (3 * 2) / 2) * 3. Alright, let's break this down step by step. I remember that I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, I'll handle the expressions inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (4 + 6) = 10\n\nSo, (4 + 6)^2 becomes 10^2.\n\n2. (3 * 2) = 6\n\nSo, (3 * 2) / 2 becomes 6 / 2.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to:\n\n(10^2 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nNext, I need to handle the exponents:\n\n10^2 = 100\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n(100 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nNext, I'll do the division:\n\n6 / 2 = 3\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(100 - 3) * 3\n\nThen, subtraction:\n\n100 - 3 = 97\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n97 * 3\n\nFinally, multiplication:\n\n97 * 3 = 291\n\nSo, the final answer should be 291.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me go through it again:\n\nOriginal expression: ((4 + 6)^2 - (3 * 2) / 2) * 3\n\nFirst, parentheses:\n\n4 + 6 = 10\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nSo, it becomes (10^2 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n10^2 = 100\n\nNow, 100 - 6 / 2 * 3\n\nNext, division and multiplication from left to right:\n\n6 / 2 = 3\n\nThen, 100 - 3 * 3\n\nNow, 3 * 3 = 9\n\nSo, 100 - 9 = 91\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the order in the second attempt. Let's see.\n\nOriginal expression: ((4 + 6)^2 - (3 * 2) / 2) * 3\n\nAfter first step: (10^2 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nExponents: 100 - 6 / 2 * 3\n\nNow, according to PEMDAS, multiplication and division are handled from left to right.\n\nSo, first, 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThen, 3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, 100 - 9 = 91\n\nSo, the final answer is 91.\n\nBut in my first attempt, I multiplied 97 by 3 to get 291, which is incorrect.\n\nLet me see where I went wrong in the first attempt.\n\nOh, I see. In the first attempt, I had (100 - 3) * 3, which is 97 * 3 = 291.\n\nBut actually, it should be 100 - (6 / 2) * 3.\n\nSo, according to PEMDAS, I need to do the division and multiplication before subtraction.\n\nSo, it's 6 / 2 = 3, then 3 * 3 = 9, and finally 100 - 9 = 91.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, considering the expression inside the parentheses first: (100 - 6 / 2), and then multiplying by 3.\n\nBut, according to PEMDAS, division has higher precedence than subtraction, so 6 / 2 = 3, then 100 - 3 = 97, and then 97 * 3 = 291.\n\nWait, but multiplication and division have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right.\n\nSo, in the expression 100 - 6 / 2 * 3, first, 6 / 2 = 3, then 3 * 3 = 9, then 100 - 9 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if it were (100 - 6 / 2) * 3, then inside the parentheses, 6 / 2 = 3, then 100 - 3 = 97, and then 97 * 3 = 291.\n\nBut in the original expression, it's ((4 + 6)^2 - (3 * 2) / 2) * 3.\n\nSo, let's re-examine the expression.\n\nOriginal expression: ((4 + 6)^2 - (3 * 2) / 2) * 3\n\nAfter simplifying inside the parentheses:\n\n(10^2 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nWhich is (100 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nNow, inside the parentheses: 100 - 6 / 2\n\nAccording to PEMDAS, division comes before subtraction, so 6 / 2 = 3, then 100 - 3 = 97\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 97 * 3 = 291\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91.\n\nNow I'm confused.\n\nLet me check the expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: ((4 + 6)^2 - (3 * 2) / 2) * 3\n\nAfter simplifying parentheses: (10^2 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nWhich is (100 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nNow, is the division only for the 6 and 2, or does it affect the subtraction as well?\n\nIn other words, is it (100 - (6 / 2)) * 3 or 100 - (6 / 2 * 3)?\n\nI think it's (100 - (6 / 2)) * 3, which is (100 - 3) * 3 = 97 * 3 = 291\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 100 - (6 / 2 * 3) = 100 - (3 * 3) = 100 - 9 = 91\n\nWait, there's a confusion here.\n\nLet's look at the original expression again: ((4 + 6)^2 - (3 * 2) / 2) * 3\n\nAfter simplifying inside the parentheses: (10^2 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nWhich is (100 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nNow, according to PEMDAS, division comes before subtraction, so 6 / 2 = 3\n\nThen, 100 - 3 = 97\n\nFinally, 97 * 3 = 291\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 291.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 91, but that would be the case if the expression was 100 - (6 / 2 * 3), which it's not.\n\nThe expression is (100 - 6 / 2) * 3, which is different from 100 - (6 / 2 * 3)\n\nBecause in the first case, it's (100 - 3) * 3 = 97 * 3 = 291\n\nIn the second case, it's 100 - (3 * 3) = 100 - 9 = 91\n\nSo, the placement of parentheses changes the order of operations.\n\nIn the original expression, it's ((4 + 6)^2 - (3 * 2) / 2) * 3, which simplifies to (100 - 6 / 2) * 3, which is (100 - 3) * 3 = 97 * 3 = 291\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 291.\n\nI must have misread the expression earlier when I thought it was 100 - (6 / 2 * 3)\n\nBut in the original expression, it's clearly (100 - 6 / 2) * 3\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed 291.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{291} \\]"
