        "content": "Let's see. There's a $100 gift card, and a group of friends wants to split the cost evenly, with each person contributing $8. I need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nSo, if each person contributes $8, and the total is $100, I can set up an equation to find the number of people. Let's let \\( n \\) represent the number of people in the group.\n\nThe total contribution would be \\( 8n \\), since each person contributes $8.\n\nThis total should equal $100, so I can write:\n\n\\( 8n = 100 \\)\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( n \\). To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n\n\\( n = \\frac{100}{8} \\)\n\nCalculating that, 100 divided by 8 is 12.5.\n\nWait, that's strange. You can't have half a person. So, there must be something wrong here.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the contribution might not be exact, and there's some change left over. Or perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nLet me think differently. If each person contributes $8, and there are \\( n \\) people, the total contributed is \\( 8n \\). This should cover the $100 gift card.\n\nSo, \\( 8n \\geq 100 \\), and \\( n \\) should be an integer since you can't have a fraction of a person.\n\nTo find the smallest integer \\( n \\) that satisfies this inequality:\n\n\\( n \\geq \\frac{100}{8} = 12.5 \\)\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, \\( n \\) must be at least 13.\n\nBut wait, 13 people contributing $8 each would give \\( 13 \\times 8 = 104 \\), which is $4 more than $100.\n\nSo, they would have $104, but the gift card is only $100. Maybe they can still proceed, and have some change left over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects exact contribution, but that gives a fractional number of people, which doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Maybe the gift card cost isn't exactly $100, or the contributions aren't exactly $8 each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group decides to have one person pay a little less, or they find another way to split the cost evenly.\n\nBut based on the information given, if each person pays $8, and the total is $100, then \\( n = \\frac{100}{8} = 12.5 \\), which isn't possible.\n\nSo, the only feasible solution is \\( n = 13 \\), with a total contribution of $104.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group decides to have 12 people pay $8 each, totaling $96, and one person pays the remaining $4.\n\nBut the problem says they split the cost evenly, which suggests each person pays the same amount.\n\nIn that case, the only way to have each person pay $8 is to have 13 people, paying a total of $104, which is $4 more than the gift card cost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group is trying to minimize the number of people, so they might have 13 people pay $8 each, and deal with the extra $4 in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group decides to pay more than $8 each to cover the exact $100.\n\nBut the problem specifies that each person contributes $8.\n\nGiven that, and considering that 12 people would only contribute $96, which is $4 short, and 13 people would contribute $104, which is $4 more, the only way to reach exactly $100 with each person paying $8 is to have 12.5 people, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the problem might have a mistake, or perhaps it's allowing for extra money.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be 13 people, with a total contribution of $104.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group is splitting the cost based on some other criteria.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the group has already decided to have each person pay $8, and they need to find out how many people are needed to cover the $100.\n\nIn that case, they would need at least 13 people to cover the $100, with $4 left over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group has a certain number of people, and they're trying to see if $8 each is enough to cover the $100.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it seems like the group has decided to split the cost evenly by each contributing $8, and I need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nGiven that, and the calculation leading to 12.5 people, which is impossible, perhaps the problem is indicating that the group has 13 people, with each paying $8, and they end up with $104, which covers the $100 gift card with $4 left over.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group has 12 people, each paying $8, totaling $96, and they are short by $4.\n\nBut the problem says they are splitting the cost evenly, which suggests that the total should be exactly $100.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that 12 people would pay $96 and 13 would pay $104, perhaps the group has 13 people, and they are accepting to pay $104 in total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group has 12 people, and they are accepting to pay only $96, which is $4 less than the gift card cost.\n\nBut the problem says they are splitting the cost evenly, implying that the total should be $100.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is incorrectly set up, as having each person pay $8 would not result in an exact total without having a fractional number of people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group is rounding the contributions, but that's not specified.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best answer is that there are 13 people in the group, each paying $8, totaling $104, which covers the $100 gift card with $4 left over.\n\nSo, the answer is 13 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
