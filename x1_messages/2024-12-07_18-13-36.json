So, you want to create a simple Node.js application that listens on port 3000 and, when you make an HTTP GET request to it, it responds with the current date and time in JSON format. Sounds straightforward.\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org if you don't have it already. Once you have Node.js set up, you can create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js project there.\n\nOpen your terminal or command prompt, create a new directory, navigate into it, and run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file with default settings. This file will manage your project's dependencies.\n\nNext, you'll need to install the Express framework, which makes handling HTTP requests much easier in Node.js. You can install Express by running `npm install express` in your project directory.\n\nOnce Express is installed, you can create a new JavaScript file, let's say `app.js`, and start building your application.\n\nIn `app.js`, you'll need to require the Express module and create an instance of an Express application.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n```\n\nNow, you need to define a route that listens for GET requests. Since you want to respond with the current date and time, you can create a route that returns this information in JSON format.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  const currentTime = new Date();\n  res.json({ timestamp: currentTime.toISOString() });\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, `app.get()` defines a route for GET requests to the root URL ('/'). When a GET request is made to this URL, the callback function is executed. It creates a new Date object to get the current date and time, converts it to an ISO string, and sends it back as a JSON response.\n\nFinally, you need to make your application listen on port 3000. You can do this by calling the `listen()` method on your app instance.\n\n```javascript\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis will start a server that listens on port 3000, and when it's running, it will log a message to the console.\n\nPutting it all together, your `app.js` should look like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  const currentTime = new Date();\n  res.json({ timestamp: currentTime.toISOString() });\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nTo run your application, open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run `node app.js`. You should see the message indicating that the server is running.\n\nNow, open a web browser or use a tool like curl or Postman to make a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should receive a JSON response containing the current date and time.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple Node.js application using Express that responds with the current date and time in JSON format when accessed via HTTP GET request.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n"
