        "content": "Alright, I'll help you with that. First, make sure you have MySQL installed and running on your system. Also, ensure that you have the `mysql-connector-python` package installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install mysql-connector-python\n```\n\nNow, let's proceed to write the Python script. We'll need to connect to the MySQL database, create a table named \"employees\" with the specified columns, and then insert five sample records into it.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Import the MySQL connector module:**\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\nfrom mysql.connector import Error\n```\n\n2. **Establish a connection to the MySQL database:**\n\nYou'll need to provide your database credentials such as host, database, user, and password.\n\n```python\ndef create_connection():\n    connection = None;\n    try:\n        connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n            host='localhost',\n            database='your_database_name',\n            user='your_username',\n            password='your_password'\n        )\n        print(\"Connection to MySQL DB successful\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(f\"The error '{e}' occurred\")\n    return connection\n```\n\nReplace `'localhost'`, `'your_database_name'`, `'your_username'`, and `'your_password'` with your actual database host, database name, username, and password.\n\n3. **Create the \"employees\" table:**\n\nDefine a function to create the table with the specified columns.\n\n```python\ndef create_table(connection):\n    cursor = connection.cursor()\n    create_table_query = \"\"\"\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (\n        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n        age INT NOT NULL,\n        salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL\n    )\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        cursor.execute(create_table_query)\n        print(\"Table 'employees' created successfully\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(f\"The error '{e}' occurred\")\n```\n\n4. **Insert sample records into the \"employees\" table:**\n\nDefine a function to insert five sample records.\n\n```python\ndef insert_records(connection):\n    cursor = connection.cursor()\n    sample_records = [\n        (\"John Doe\", 30, 50000.00),\n        (\"Jane Smith\", 25, 45000.00),\n        (\"Alice Johnson\", 35, 60000.00),\n        (\"Bob Brown\", 40, 70000.00),\n        (\"Charlie Davis\", 28, 48000.00)\n    ]\n    insert_query = \"\"\"\n    INSERT INTO employees (name, age, salary) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        cursor.executemany(insert_query, sample_records)\n        connection.commit()\n        print(\"Records inserted successfully\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(f\"The error '{e}' occurred\")\n```\n\n5. **Main function to orchestrate the operations:**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    connection = create_connection()\n    if connection is not None:\n        create_table(connection)\n        insert_records(connection)\n        connection.close()\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to connect to the database\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Complete Script\n\nPutting it all together, your complete Python script should look like this:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\nfrom mysql.connector import Error\n\ndef create_connection():\n    connection = None;\n    try:\n        connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n            host='localhost',\n            database='your_database_name',\n            user='your_username',\n            password='your_password'\n        )\n        print(\"Connection to MySQL DB successful\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(f\"The error '{e}' occurred\")\n    return connection\n\ndef create_table(connection):\n    cursor = connection.cursor()\n    create_table_query = \"\"\"\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (\n        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n        age INT NOT NULL,\n        salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL\n    )\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        cursor.execute(create_table_query)\n        print(\"Table 'employees' created successfully\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(f\"The error '{e}' occurred\")\n\ndef insert_records(connection):\n    cursor = connection.cursor()\n    sample_records = [\n        (\"John Doe\", 30, 50000.00),\n        (\"Jane Smith\", 25, 45000.00),\n        (\"Alice Johnson\", 35, 60000.00),\n        (\"Bob Brown\", 40, 70000.00),\n        (\"Charlie Davis\", 28, 48000.00)\n    ]\n    insert_query = \"\"\"\n    INSERT INTO employees (name, age, salary) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        cursor.executemany(insert_query, sample_records)\n        connection.commit()\n        print(\"Records inserted successfully\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(f\"The error '{e}' occurred\")\n\ndef main():\n    connection = create_connection()\n    if connection is not None:\n        create_table(connection)\n        insert_records(connection)\n        connection.close()\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to connect to the database\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Connection Setup:**\n   - The `create_connection` function establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the provided credentials.\n\n2. **Table Creation:**\n   - The `create_table` function creates a table named \"employees\" with columns for id, name, age, and salary. The id column is set as the primary key with auto-increment.\n\n3. **Data Insertion:**\n   - The `insert_records` function inserts five sample records into the \"employees\" table.\n\n4. **Main Function:**\n   - The `main` function calls the above functions in sequence to connect to the database, create the table, insert records, and then close the connection.\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholder values in the `create_connection` function with your actual database credentials before running the script."
