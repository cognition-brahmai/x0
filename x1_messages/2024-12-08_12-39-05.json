        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to write a Python script that scrapes a Wikipedia page, finds all the links to other Wikipedia pages, and saves them into a text file. The script should take the URL of the Wikipedia page as a command-line argument and use BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to make sure I have BeautifulSoup installed. I think it's part of the standard library, but I might be wrong. Let me check that. Oh, wait, no, BeautifulSoup is a third-party library, so I'll need to install it if it's not already installed. I can do that using pip.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Accept a URL from the command line.\n\n2. Download the HTML content from that URL.\n\n3. Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup.\n\n4. Find all the links that point to other Wikipedia pages.\n\n5. Write those links to a text file.\n\nI need to be careful about what constitutes a link to another Wikipedia page. Wikipedia pages have URLs that typically look like `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Title`, so I should look for links that start with `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/`.\n\nAlso, I should consider handling relative links, just in case. Although, Wikipedia seems to use absolute links mostly.\n\nLet me think about edge cases:\n\n- Pages with no links.\n\n- Pages with lots of links.\n\n- Links that are not to other Wikipedia pages.\n\n- Special pages or categories.\n\nI need to make sure that my script handles these gracefully.\n\nAlright, starting with accepting the URL from the command line. In Python, I can use the `sys` module to access command-line arguments.\n\nSo, the script will look something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nimport requests\n\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 2:\n\nprint(\"Usage: python script.py <wikipedia_url>\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nurl = sys.argv[1]\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code != 200:\n\nprint(f\"Failed to retrieve the page: {response.status_code}\")\n\nsys.exit(1)\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find all links to other Wikipedia pages\n\nwiki_links = []\n\nfor a in soup.find_all('a', href=True):\n\nhref = a['href']\n\nif href.startswith('/wiki/'):\n\nwiki_links.append(f\"https://en.wikipedia.org{href}\")\n\n# Write the links to a text file\n\nwith open('wiki_links.txt', 'w') as file:\n\nfor link in wiki_links:\n\nfile.write(link + '\\n')\n\nprint(f\"Found {len(wiki_links)} Wikipedia links. Saved to wiki_links.txt\")\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. Let me test this logic with a known Wikipedia page, say, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping.\n\nAssuming this works, I might want to add some more features, like handling different language Wikipedia sites, or excluding certain types of links, like categories or files.\n\nAlso, I should think about avoiding infinite loops or recursion if I were to expand this to follow links, but for now, the task is just to extract links from a single page.\n\nI should also consider adding error handling for cases where the URL is invalid or the page doesn't exist.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to normalize the links, perhaps by removing any query parameters or anchors, depending on the requirements.\n\nBut for the basic task, this should suffice.\n\nLet me think about how to make it more efficient or robust.\n\n- Use a user-agent string in the HTTP request to mimic a browser, in case Wikipedia blocks scrapers.\n\n- Implement caching to avoid redundant downloads.\n\n- Handle redirects properly.\n\nBut again, for a simple script, maybe it's overkill.\n\nI should also consider that some links might be redundant, pointing to the same page with different capitalization or encoding. Maybe I can normalize the links by converting them to lowercase and removing any percent-encoded characters if possible.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the script doesn't include links to images, categories, user pages, etc., only to article pages. Wikipedia has a variety of namespaces, and I might want to restrict the links to the main namespace.\n\nTo do that, I can check if the href starts with `/wiki/` and doesn't contain certain strings like `:Category:`, `:Category:`, `:File:`, etc.\n\nSo, I can exclude links that contain these prefixes.\n\nLet me update the code accordingly.\n\nwiki_links = []\n\nexcluded_namespaces = [':Category:', ':File:', ':Template:', ':Help:', ':Category:', ':Portal:', ':WikiProject:', ':TimedText:', ':Module:', ':Special:', ':Talk:']\n\nfor a in soup.find_all('a', href=True):\n\nhref = a['href']\n\nif href.startswith('/wiki/') and not any(ns in href for ns in excluded_namespaces):\n\nwiki_links.append(f\"https://en.wikipedia.org{href}\")\n\nThis should help in filtering out non-article pages.\n\nMoreover, I can read the list of namespaces to exclude from a configuration file or make it a parameter, but for simplicity, hardcoding them should be fine.\n\nAnother consideration is that some links might be disabled or have other attributes; I should make sure to capture all relevant links.\n\nAlso, I should think about how to handle redirects. If a link points to a redirected page, I might want to follow the redirect and get the actual page URL.\n\nBut that could complicate things, and for now, maybe it's acceptable to just list the links as they are.\n\nI should also consider that some links might be blocked from crawling, as per Wikipedia's robots.txt rules.\n\nBut since I'm just scraping a single page for educational purposes, it should be fine.\n\nI need to make sure that the script doesn't violate any terms of service or legal requirements.\n\nLastly, I should add some comments to the code for clarity and possibly include a license.\n\nFor a personal script, maybe that's not necessary, but it's a good practice.\n\nAlright, I think this covers the basic requirements. I can test the script with a few different Wikipedia pages to ensure it works as expected.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this task, we will write a Python script that Scrapes a given Wikipedia page, extracts all the links to other Wikipedia pages, and writes them to a text file. The script will accept the URL of the Wikipedia page as a command-line argument and will use BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Accept the URL from the command line**: Use the `sys` module to retrieve the URL provided as a command-line argument.\n2. **Download the HTML content**: Use the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of the provided URL.\n3. **Parse the HTML**: Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content.\n4. **Extract relevant links**: Find all `<a>` tags with `href` attributes that point to other Wikipedia pages, excluding links to categories, files, etc.\n5. **Write the links to a text file**: Save the extracted links into a text file named `wiki_links.txt`.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python script.py <wikipedia_url>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    url = sys.argv[1]\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    \n    if response.status_code != 200:\n        print(f\"Failed to retrieve the page: {response.status_code}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Define excluded namespaces\n    excluded_namespaces = [\n        ':Category:', ':File:', ':Template:', ':Help:', ':Category:', ':Portal:', ':WikiProject:', ':TimedText:', ':Module:', ':Special:', ':Talk:'\n    ]\n    \n    # Find all wiki links excluding the specified namespaces\n    wiki_links = []\n    for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True):\n        href = a['href']\n        if href.startswith('/wiki/') and not any(ns in href for ns in excluded_namespaces):\n            wiki_links.append(f\"https://en.wikipedia.org{href}\")\n    \n    # Write the links to a text file\n    with open('wiki_links.txt', 'w') as file:\n        for link in wiki_links:\n            file.write(link + '\\n')\n    \n    print(f\"Found {len(wiki_links)} Wikipedia links. Saved to wiki_links.txt\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Command-Line Argument Handling**: The script checks if exactly one argument (the URL) is provided. If not, it prints the correct usage and exits.\n2. **HTTP Request**: It uses the `requests` library to get the HTML content of the Wikipedia page.\n3. **HTML Parsing**: BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content, making it easy to extract the required data.\n4. **Link Extraction**: It iterates through all `<a>` tags with `href` attributes, filters them to include only those starting with `/wiki/` and excluding specified namespaces.\n5. **Writing to File**: The extracted links are written to `wiki_links.txt`, each on a new line.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward way to extract and save links from a Wikipedia page, ensuring that only relevant article links are included."
