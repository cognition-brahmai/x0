        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a train traveling from City A to City B, and then from City B to City C. The distance from A to B is 200 miles, and from B to C is 300 miles. The train goes at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for the whole trip, and I need to find out how long it takes to get from City A to City C.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total distance the train travels. Since it goes from A to B, which is 200 miles, and then from B to C, which is 300 miles, the total distance is 200 plus 300 miles. So, 200 + 300 equals 500 miles in total.\n\nNext, I know that average speed is equal to the total distance divided by the total time. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{average speed} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}} \\]\n\nI have the average speed (50 mph) and the total distance (500 miles), and I need to find the total time. So, I can rearrange the formula to solve for time:\n\n\\[ \\text{total time} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{average speed}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{total time} = \\frac{500 \\text{ miles}}{50 \\text{ mph}} \\]\n\nNow, 500 divided by 50 is 10. So, the total time should be 10 hours.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the train is going 50 miles per hour, and it has to cover 500 miles, then yes, 500 divided by 50 is indeed 10 hours.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by calculating the time for each leg of the journey separately and then adding them up.\n\nFirst, from A to B: 200 miles at 50 mph.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 200 / 50 = 4 hours.\n\nThen, from B to C: 300 miles at 50 mph.\n\nTime = 300 / 50 = 6 hours.\n\nNow, add those times together: 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it definitely takes 10 hours in total to travel from City A to City C.\n\nI think that's the answer: 10 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
