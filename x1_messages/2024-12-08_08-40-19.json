        "content": "The musical instrument you're referring to is called the bagpipes. It's indeed strongly associated with Scotland, although similar instruments have been used in various cultures around the world for centuries. The bagpipes consist of a bag, usually made from animal skin, which is filled with air. This bag is then compressed by the player's arm to force air through the pipes. The pipes typically include a chanter, which plays the melody, and drones, which produce a constant pitch to accompany the melody. The Scottish Great Highland Bagpipe is perhaps the most well-known type, often featured in military bands and ceremonial events."
