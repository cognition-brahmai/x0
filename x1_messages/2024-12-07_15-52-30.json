        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car rental company with a total of 120 cars in their fleet. The ratio of sedans to SUVs is currently 3:2. We need to figure out how many more sedans the company needs to purchase to make the ratio of sedans to SUVs equal, meaning a 1:1 ratio.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the current numbers of sedans and SUVs are based on the given ratio. The ratio is 3:2, which means for every 3 sedans, there are 2 SUVs. To find out how many groups of these 3 sedans and 2 SUVs make up the total fleet of 120 cars, I'll add the parts of the ratio together: 3 + 2 = 5 parts in total.\n\nNow, each part represents a certain number of cars. To find out how many cars per part, I'll divide the total number of cars by the total number of parts: 120 cars \u00f7 5 parts = 24 cars per part.\n\nSo, the number of sedans is 3 parts \u00d7 24 cars per part = 72 sedans.\n\nThe number of SUVs is 2 parts \u00d7 24 cars per part = 48 SUVs.\n\nNow, we want to make the ratio of sedans to SUVs 1:1. That means the number of sedans should be equal to the number of SUVs.\n\nCurrently, there are 72 sedans and 48 SUVs. To make the number of sedans equal to the number of SUVs, we need to have the same number of each.\n\nBut the problem is asking how many more sedans need to be purchased to make the ratio 1:1. Wait a minute, that seems a bit confusing because if we have more sedans than SUVs currently, to make them equal, we would actually need to make the number of sedans equal to the number of SUVs, which is 48. But that would mean reducing the number of sedans, not increasing them.\n\nHmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The ratio of sedans to SUVs is 3:2, and we need to make the ratio 1:1.\"\n\nSo, 3:2 currently, and we want 1:1.\n\nWait, in a 3:2 ratio, there are more sedans than SUVs. In a 1:1 ratio, the numbers are equal.\n\nBut in this case, since there are already more sedans (72) than SUVs (48), to make them equal, we would need to have the same number of each.\n\nBut the question is asking how many more sedans need to be purchased to make the ratio 1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the direction of the change.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf we are to purchase more sedans, that means we are adding sedans to the current number of sedans, which is 72. Let's say we purchase x more sedans. So, the new number of sedans will be 72 + x.\n\nThe number of SUVs remains the same, which is 48.\n\nWe want the new ratio to be 1:1, meaning the number of sedans should equal the number of SUVs.\n\nSo, 72 + x = 48.\n\nSolving for x: x = 48 - 72 = -24.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because we can't purchase a negative number of sedans. That would mean we need to remove 24 sedans to make the numbers equal.\n\nBut the problem is asking for how many more sedans need to be purchased, implying that we need to add sedans to make the ratio 1:1.\n\nBut according to this calculation, we actually need to reduce the number of sedans, not purchase more.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"how many more sedans does the company need to purchase to make the ratio 1:1?\"\n\nIf the current ratio is 3:2, and we have 72 sedans and 48 SUVs, to make the ratio 1:1, we need to have the same number of sedans and SUVs.\n\nSo, to make the number of sedans equal to the number of SUVs, we need to have 48 sedans, since there are 48 SUVs.\n\nBut currently, there are 72 sedans, which is already more than 48.\n\nSo, to make them equal, we would need to reduce the number of sedans to 48, which means removing 24 sedans.\n\nBut the question is asking how many more sedans need to be purchased, which suggests adding sedans.\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to purchase sedans so that the new ratio becomes 1:1, but perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the current numbers.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal cars: 120\n\nRatio of sedans to SUVs: 3:2\n\nSo, parts: 3 + 2 = 5 parts\n\nCars per part: 120 \u00f7 5 = 24\n\nSedans: 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n\nSUVs: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n\nTo have a 1:1 ratio, sedans should equal SUVs, which is 48.\n\nSo, to reach 48 sedans from 72, we need to subtract 24 sedans.\n\nBut the question is about purchasing more sedans, which would increase the number of sedans.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose we are to purchase x more sedans, making the new number of sedans 72 + x.\n\nThe number of SUVs remains 48.\n\nWe want the ratio of sedans to SUVs to be 1:1, meaning sedans = SUVs.\n\nSo, 72 + x = 48\n\nSolving for x: x = 48 - 72 = -24\n\nAgain, we get a negative value, which doesn't make sense in the context of purchasing (adding) sedans.\n\nThis indicates that to achieve a 1:1 ratio, the company actually needs to reduce the number of sedans, not purchase more.\n\nHowever, the problem specifically asks how many more sedans need to be purchased to make the ratio 1:1.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding of it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company has a different current ratio or total number of cars.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the problem statement: \"the ratio of sedans to SUVs is 3:2\" and \"to make the ratio 1:1\".\n\nGiven that, and the total number of cars is 120, the calculations seem correct.\n\nPerhaps the problem is misphrased, or there's a misunderstanding in what \"make the ratio 1:1\" means.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company needs to purchase both sedans and SUVs, but the question specifies only purchasing sedans.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company has a different current fleet composition.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when new sedans are purchased, the total number of cars increases.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that purchasing sedans will increase the total number of cars, not just the number of sedans.\n\nWait, no, purchasing sedans only increases the number of sedans, and thus the total number of cars increases accordingly.\n\nBut in this case, since the problem specifies \"purchase more sedans\", it implies that only sedans are being added, and the number of SUVs remains the same.\n\nBut as per the earlier calculation, to make the ratio 1:1, we would need to have the number of sedans equal to the number of SUVs.\n\nGiven that, and the current numbers, it seems that no additional sedans need to be purchased; in fact, sedans need to be reduced.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks how many more sedans need to be purchased, suggesting that the answer should be a positive number.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to purchase sedans such that the new ratio of sedans to the total number of cars is 1:1, but that would be unusual, as that would mean having only sedans.\n\nWait, no, a 1:1 ratio typically refers to the ratio between two categories, in this case, sedans to SUVs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to make the ratio of sedans to SUVs 1:1 by purchasing sedans, but given the current numbers, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to make the ratio of sedans to the total number of cars 1:1, which would mean having half of the cars as sedans and half as SUVs.\n\nBut that would still require reducing the number of sedans, not increasing them.\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the total number of cars.\n\nLet me consider that when new sedans are purchased, the total number of cars increases.\n\nSo, if the company purchases x more sedans, the new number of sedans is 72 + x, and the number of SUVs remains 48.\n\nThe total number of cars would then be 120 + x.\n\nWe want the ratio of sedans to SUVs to be 1:1, meaning sedans = SUVs.\n\nSo, 72 + x = 48\n\nSolving for x: x = 48 - 72 = -24\n\nAgain, we get a negative value, indicating that to achieve a 1:1 ratio, sedans need to be decreased by 24.\n\nBut the problem is asking how many more sedans need to be purchased, implying adding sedans.\n\nThis suggests that, given the current numbers, it's not possible to reach a 1:1 ratio by purchasing more sedans; instead, sedans need to be reduced.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that no sedans need to be purchased; in fact, 24 sedans need to be removed to achieve a 1:1 ratio.\n\nBut since the question specifically asks for how many more sedans need to be purchased, and the answer is that purchasing more sedans is not needed, perhaps the answer is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misphrased or there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation.\n\nGiven the calculations, the only logical conclusion is that no additional sedans need to be purchased; instead, sedans need to be reduced.\n\nTherefore, the company does not need to purchase any more sedans to achieve a 1:1 ratio; in fact, they need to reduce the number of sedans by 24.\n\nBut since the question asks for how many more sedans need to be purchased, and the answer is zero, I suppose the answer is that no additional sedans need to be purchased.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to interpret this.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to make the ratio of sedans to SUVs 1:1 by purchasing sedans, assuming that SUVs can also change, but the problem specifies that only sedans are being purchased.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the initial ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the equation differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of sedans to be purchased as x.\n\nThen, the new number of sedans is 72 + x.\n\nThe number of SUVs remains 48.\n\nWe want the ratio (72 + x)/48 = 1/1.\n\nSo, 72 + x = 48\n\nThus, x = 48 - 72 = -24.\n\nAgain, we get x = -24, which implies a reduction, not an addition.\n\nTherefore, the company does not need to purchase any more sedans; instead, they need to remove 24 sedans to achieve a 1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that the question asks for how many more sedans need to be purchased, the answer is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to make the ratio of sedans to the total number of cars 1:1, which would mean having only sedans.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, as that would require removing all SUVs, which isn't relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to make the number of sedans equal to the number of SUVs by purchasing sedans, but as shown, that requires x = -24, which is reduction, not purchase.\n\nGiven this, I think the only logical answer is that no sedans need to be purchased; instead, sedans need to be reduced by 24 to achieve a 1:1 ratio.\n\nBut since the question specifically asks for how many more sedans need to be purchased, and the answer is zero, I will conclude that no additional sedans need to be purchased.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
