        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a class of 30 students, 18 students like chocolate ice cream. I need to find out what percentage of the class likes chocolate ice cream. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that percentage means \"per hundred,\" so I want to find out how many students like chocolate ice cream per 100 students, even though there are only 30 students in the class. Makes sense.\n\nSo, the formula to find the percentage is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of students who like chocolate ice cream, which is 18, and the \"whole\" is the total number of students in the class, which is 30.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{18}{30} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nHmm, 18 divided by 30. Let's see, 18 divided by 30 is the same as 18/30. I can simplify that fraction before multiplying by 100.\n\nSo, 18/30 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6, which gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18 \\div 6}{30 \\div 6} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nSo, 3/5 times 100 would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 100 = 3 \\times 20 = 60\\%\n\\]\n\nWait, how did I get that? Let me check again. 3/5 of 100 should be 60, because 3 times 20 is 60.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{30} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nAnd then, 0.6 multiplied by 100 is 60%.\n\nSo, 60% of the class likes chocolate ice cream.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of students is 30, and 18 like chocolate ice cream. So, 18 out of 30 is indeed 60%.\n\nAnother way to think about it is, if 30 students represent 100%, then each student represents \\frac{100}{30} percent, which is approximately 3.333%. So, 18 students would be 18 times 3.333%, which is 60%.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the final answer is 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
