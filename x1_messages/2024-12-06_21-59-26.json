        "content": "So there are 25 red balls and 15 blue balls in a box, making a total of 40 balls. I need to find the probability that when I draw two balls at random without replacement, both of them are red.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible ways to draw two balls out of 40 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 40 is C(40, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(40, 2) = 40! / (2!(40 - 2)!) = (40 \u00d7 39) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 780.\n\nSo, there are 780 possible ways to draw 2 balls from 40.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 25.\n\nSo, that's C(25, 2).\n\nCalculating C(25, 2):\n\nC(25, 2) = 25! / (2!(25 - 2)!) = (25 \u00d7 24) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 300.\n\nSo, there are 300 ways to choose 2 red balls from 25.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 300 / 780.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 30:\n\n300 \u00f7 30 = 10\n\n780 \u00f7 30 = 26\n\nSo, 10/26, which can be simplified further by dividing both by 2:\n\n10 \u00f7 2 = 5\n\n26 \u00f7 2 = 13\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 5/13.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 5/13.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this step by step, considering the draws without replacement.\n\nThe probability that the first ball drawn is red is 25/40, since there are 25 red balls out of 40 total balls.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, there are now 24 red balls left and a total of 39 balls left in the box.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is 24/39.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability that both balls are red is (25/40) \u00d7 (24/39).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 25/40 can be simplified to 5/8.\n\nSecond, 24/39 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 24 \u00f7 3 = 8, 39 \u00f7 3 = 13, so 8/13.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (5/8) \u00d7 (8/13) = (5 \u00d7 8) / (8 \u00d7 13) = 40 / 104.\n\nSimplifying 40/104 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 8: 40 \u00f7 8 = 5, 104 \u00f7 8 = 13, so again 5/13.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 5/13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}} \\]"
