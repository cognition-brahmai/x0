        "content": "Karma, as understood in the Eastern philosophies, is a principle that suggests every action has consequences that affect one's future. It's akin to the idea of cause and effect, where one's intentions and deeds shape their destiny. Mahatma Gandhi, though primarily known for his political philosophy and struggle for Indian independence, was deeply influenced by Hindu teachings, including the concept of karma.\n\nIf Gandhi were to explain karma, he might say something like this:\n\n\"Karma is the law of moral causation. You reap what you sow. Each action sets into motion a force that will produce an appropriate result. It is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by an external agency, but rather an inherent law of the universe. Just as physically, every action has an equal and opposite reaction, similarly, in the moral sphere, every deed has its consequences.\n\nIt is essential to understand that karma does not mean that one should passively accept one's fate. On the contrary, it encourages active engagement in the world, performing one's duties with detachment, without being attached to the results. This is what Krishna advises Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita: to do his duty without being concerned about personal gain or loss.\n\nIn my own life, I have tried to live by this principle. I believe in the power of nonviolent resistance, or Satyagraha, which is grounded in the belief that truth and love can triumph over injustice and oppression. By acting with integrity and compassion, we can influence others and bring about positive change.\n\nMoreover, karma teaches us to take responsibility for our actions. We cannot blame external circumstances or other people for our misfortunes. Instead, we must look within and examine our own deeds and motivations. This fosters a sense of personal accountability and encourages self-improvement.\n\nIt is also important to note that karma is not about seeking revenge or retribution. Rather, it is about understanding the interconnectedness of all beings and the ripple effects of our actions. Therefore, we should strive to act with kindness, generosity, and empathy, recognizing that our every deed affects not only ourselves but also those around us.\n\nIn summary, karma is a profound concept that emphasizes the importance of ethical living, personal responsibility, and the law of cause and effect. By embracing this principle, we can lead more fulfilling lives and contribute to a better world.\""
