        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many units the factory produces in a month. Since it produces 200 units per day and there are 30 days in the month, the total production would be:\n\n200 units/day * 30 days = 6000 units\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these units. Each unit is sold for $50, so:\n\n6000 units * $50/unit = $300,000\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total costs. There are fixed costs and variable costs. The fixed costs are $3000 per month, and the variable costs are $10 per unit produced. So, the total variable costs would be:\n\n6000 units * $10/unit = $60,000\n\nAdding the fixed costs:\n\n$60,000 + $3,000 = $63,000\n\nFinally, to find the profit, we subtract the total costs from the total revenue:\n\n$300,000 - $63,000 = $237,000\n\nSo, the factory makes a profit of $237,000 in a 30-day month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{237000} \\]"
