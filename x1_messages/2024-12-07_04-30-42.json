        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 120 cars in total. If they rent out 70% of them on a given day, I need to find out how many cars are still available for rent.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many cars are rented out. To do that, I can find 70% of 120. I know that percentages can be converted to decimals for calculations, so 70% is the same as 0.70.\n\nSo, the number of cars rented out is 120 multiplied by 0.70. Let me do that multiplication: 120 \u00d7 0.70 = 84 cars.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are still available, I need to subtract the number of cars rented out from the total number of cars. That would be 120 - 84.\n\nLet's do that subtraction: 120 - 84 = 36 cars.\n\nSo, there are 36 cars still available for rent.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. 70% of 120 should be 84, and subtracting that from 120 should indeed give me 36. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the percentage of cars that are not rented out. If 70% are rented out, then 30% are still available. So, I could also find 30% of 120 to get the number of available cars.\n\nLet me try that. 30% of 120 is 0.30 \u00d7 120 = 36 cars. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, both methods give me the same answer, which reassures me that 36 is the correct number of cars still available for rent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
