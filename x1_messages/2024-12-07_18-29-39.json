        "content": "Let's see here. So, we have three friends who decide to share a pizza equally. The pizza is cut into 8 equal slices, and after they finish eating, there's one slice left uneaten. I need to figure out what fraction of the pizza each friend ate.\n\nFirst, I should understand how much pizza there was in total and how much was eaten. The pizza was cut into 8 slices, and one slice was left uneaten. That means that 8 - 1 = 7 slices were eaten.\n\nNow, these 7 slices were shared equally among three friends. So, each friend ate an equal portion of these 7 slices. To find out how much each friend ate, I need to divide the total eaten slices by the number of friends.\n\nSo, each friend ate 7 slices \u00f7 3 friends. That's 7/3 slices per friend. But slices are parts of the whole pizza, which is 8 slices. So, to find the fraction of the pizza each friend ate, I need to express the number of slices each friend ate in terms of the whole pizza.\n\nEach slice is 1/8 of the pizza, so each friend ate (7/3) \u00d7 (1/8) of the pizza. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, a simpler way is to consider the total eaten pizza and divide it among the three friends. The total eaten pizza is 7 slices out of 8, which is 7/8 of the pizza. This 7/8 was shared equally among three friends.\n\nSo, each friend ate (7/8) \u00f7 3. Dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by 1/3, so that's (7/8) \u00d7 (1/3) = 7/24.\n\nTherefore, each friend ate 7/24 of the pizza.\n\nBut let me double-check this. If each friend ate 7/24 of the pizza, and there are three friends, then in total they ate 3 \u00d7 (7/24) = 21/24, which simplifies to 7/8, which matches the amount eaten. And since one slice was left uneaten, which is 1/8 of the pizza, the eaten portion is indeed 7/8.\n\nSo, yes, each friend ate 7/24 of the pizza.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{24}} \\]"
