        "content": "Let's see. So, there were originally 10 friends who went out for dinner and planned to split the bill evenly. But then, 2 friends forgot their wallets, so they couldn't pay. That means only 8 friends ended up paying the bill. To make up for the missing 2 friends, each of the remaining 8 friends paid an extra $5.\n\nI need to find out what the total bill was.\n\nFirst, let's think about what would have happened if all 10 friends had paid. Each would have paid an equal share of the total bill. Let's call the total bill \"B.\" So, each friend's share would have been B divided by 10.\n\nBut since 2 friends couldn't pay, only 8 friends paid. And each of these 8 friends paid an extra $5.\n\nSo, the amount each of the 8 friends paid is their original share plus $5.\n\nLet's express that mathematically.\n\nOriginal share per friend = B / 10\n\nExtra amount each of the 8 friends paid = $5\n\nSo, the amount each of the 8 friends actually paid = (B / 10) + 5\n\nNow, the total amount paid by the 8 friends is 8 times the amount each paid, which should equal the total bill B.\n\nSo, 8 * [(B / 10) + 5] = B\n\nNow, I can solve for B.\n\nFirst, distribute the 8:\n\n8 * (B / 10) + 8 * 5 = B\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n(8B / 10) + 40 = B\n\nSimplify 8B/10:\n\n(4B / 5) + 40 = B\n\nNow, to solve for B, I can subtract (4B / 5) from both sides:\n\n40 = B - (4B / 5)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n40 = (5B / 5) - (4B / 5)\n\n40 = (5B - 4B) / 5\n\n40 = B / 5\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 5:\n\n40 * 5 = B\n\nB = 200\n\nSo, the total bill was $200.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf the total bill is $200 and there were originally 10 friends, each would have paid $20.\n\nBut 2 friends couldn't pay, so only 8 friends paid.\n\nEach of these 8 friends paid an extra $5, so they each paid $25.\n\n8 friends paying $25 each is 8 * 25 = $200, which matches the total bill.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
