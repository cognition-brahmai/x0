        "content": "So I've got this problem here. In a group of people, 70% are wearing glasses and 30% are not. Among those who wear glasses, 60% have brown hair. I need to find out what percentage of the whole group has both glasses and brown hair.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I know that 70% of the group wears glasses. Out of these glass-wearers, 60% have brown hair. So, I need to find out what part of the entire group this corresponds to.\n\nMaybe I can think of it in terms of fractions or proportions. If 70% wear glasses, and then 60% of those have brown hair, I can multiply these percentages to find the combined percentage for both characteristics.\n\nSo, 70% times 60% should give me the percentage of the group that has both glasses and brown hair.\n\nLet me calculate that. 70% of the group wears glasses, and 60% of those have brown hair. So, 70% times 60% is 0.7 multiplied by 0.6, which is 0.42, or 42%.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. If 70% wear glasses and 60% of those have brown hair, then indeed, 0.7 times 0.6 is 0.42, which is 42%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of actual numbers to make sure. Suppose the group has 100 people. Then, 70 people wear glasses. Out of those 70, 60% have brown hair, which is 0.6 times 70, equal to 42 people. So, 42 out of 100 people have both glasses and brown hair, which is 42%.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Is there another way to look at this? Maybe using sets or Venn diagrams?\n\nLet's try a Venn diagram approach. Suppose I have one circle representing glasses wearers and another representing people with brown hair. The overlapping area would be people who have both glasses and brown hair.\n\nI know that 70% wear glasses, and among them, 60% have brown hair. So, the overlapping area is 60% of the 70% who wear glasses, which again is 42%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of conditional probability. The probability that someone has brown hair given that they wear glasses is 60%. The probability that someone wears glasses is 70%. So, the joint probability of both events is the product of the probability of wearing glasses and the conditional probability of having brown hair given that they wear glasses.\n\nIn formula terms, P(glasses and brown hair) = P(glasses) * P(brown hair | glasses).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: P(glasses and brown hair) = 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42 or 42%.\n\nOkay, so no matter which way I approach this, I keep getting 42%. I think that's the answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. The problem says that 30% are not wearing glasses, but that doesn't affect the calculation directly, since we're only interested in those who have both glasses and brown hair.\n\nHowever, if I wanted to find out the percentage of people with brown hair in the entire group, that might involve considering both those who wear glasses and those who don't. But in this specific problem, I only need to find the percentage with both glasses and brown hair, which is solely within the group that wears glasses.\n\nSo, my final answer is 42% of the group has both glasses and brown hair.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42\\%} \\]"
