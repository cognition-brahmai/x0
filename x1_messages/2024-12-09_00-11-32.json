        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a factory that produces two types of widgets, X and Y. Each widget X needs 2 hours of labor, and each widget Y needs 3 hours. The factory has up to 1200 labor hours per week. There's also demand requirements: at least 200 units of X and at least 100 units of Y per week. I need to find out the maximum number of combined widgets that can be produced in a week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to maximize the total number of widgets, which is the sum of X and Y, right? So, if I let X be the number of type X widgets and Y be the number of type Y widgets, I want to maximize X + Y.\n\nBut there are constraints:\n\n1. The labor hours: 2X + 3Y \u2264 1200 (because each X takes 2 hours and each Y takes 3 hours, and there are only 1200 hours available).\n\n2. The demand for X: X \u2265 200.\n\n3. The demand for Y: Y \u2265 100.\n\nAlso, since you can't produce negative widgets, X \u2265 0 and Y \u2265 0, but the demand requirements already make X \u2265 200 and Y \u2265 100, which are stronger than X \u2265 0 and Y \u2265 0.\n\nSo, I need to maximize X + Y subject to:\n\n2X + 3Y \u2264 1200\n\nX \u2265 200\n\nY \u2265 100\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, but since it's only two variables, I can probably solve it graphically or by finding the intersection points of the constraints.\n\nLet me try to plot these constraints.\n\nFirst, the labor constraint: 2X + 3Y \u2264 1200.\n\nLet's find the intercepts.\n\nIf X = 0: 3Y = 1200 \u2192 Y = 400.\n\nIf Y = 0: 2X = 1200 \u2192 X = 600.\n\nSo, the line 2X + 3Y = 1200 passes through (0,400) and (600,0).\n\nBut, since X \u2265 200 and Y \u2265 100, I need to consider only the feasible region where X \u2265 200 and Y \u2265 100.\n\nSo, let's see where these constraints intersect.\n\nFirst, the points where the labor constraint intersects the demand constraints.\n\nLet's see where 2X + 3Y = 1200 intersects X = 200.\n\nPlug X = 200 into 2X + 3Y = 1200:\n\n2(200) + 3Y = 1200 \u2192 400 + 3Y = 1200 \u2192 3Y = 800 \u2192 Y = 800/3 \u2248 266.67.\n\nBut Y must be at least 100, and 266.67 is greater than 100, so one point is (200, 266.67).\n\nNext, where 2X + 3Y = 1200 intersects Y = 100.\n\nPlug Y = 100 into 2X + 3Y = 1200:\n\n2X + 3(100) = 1200 \u2192 2X + 300 = 1200 \u2192 2X = 900 \u2192 X = 450.\n\nSo, another point is (450, 100).\n\nAlso, we have the points where X = 200 and Y = 100, which is (200,100), but this may not be on the labor constraint.\n\nNow, to find the maximum of X + Y, I need to evaluate X + Y at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is bounded by:\n\n- (200, 266.67)\n\n- (450, 100)\n\n- and possibly (200,100) and (600,0), but (600,0) doesn't satisfy Y \u2265 100.\n\nWait, no. (600,0) doesn't satisfy Y \u2265 100, so it's not in the feasible region.\n\nSo, the feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (200, 266.67), (450,100), and possibly another point.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if there's another intersection.\n\nLet me draw this out.\n\nX-axis: X from 200 to 600.\n\nY-axis: Y from 100 to 400.\n\nThe labor constraint is 2X + 3Y = 1200.\n\nThe demand constraints are X \u2265 200 and Y \u2265 100.\n\nSo, the feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied.\n\nGraphically, it's the area where X \u2265 200, Y \u2265 100, and 2X + 3Y \u2264 1200.\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are:\n\n1. The point where X=200 and Y=266.67.\n\n2. The point where Y=100 and X=450.\n\n3. And possibly the point where X=200 and Y=100, but I need to check if that's within the labor constraint.\n\nLet's check (200,100):\n\n2(200) + 3(100) = 400 + 300 = 700 \u2264 1200, so yes, it's within the labor constraint.\n\nSo, the feasible region is a polygon with vertices at:\n\n- (200, 266.67)\n\n- (450, 100)\n\n- (200, 100)\n\nNow, I need to evaluate X + Y at these points.\n\n1. At (200, 266.67): X + Y = 200 + 266.67 = 466.67\n\n2. At (450, 100): X + Y = 450 + 100 = 550\n\n3. At (200, 100): X + Y = 200 + 100 = 300\n\nSo, the maximum of X + Y is 550 at (450,100).\n\nBut wait, does this make sense? Let's check the labor constraint at (450,100):\n\n2(450) + 3(100) = 900 + 300 = 1200, which is exactly the maximum labor available.\n\nAnd at (200,266.67): 2(200) + 3(266.67) = 400 + 800 = 1200, same as above.\n\nBut (450,100) gives a higher total of X + Y.\n\nSo, the maximum number of combined widgets is 550.\n\nBut I need to make sure that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me check:\n\n- X = 450 \u2265 200\n\n- Y = 100 \u2265 100\n\n- 2(450) + 3(100) = 900 + 300 = 1200 \u2264 1200\n\nAll constraints are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of combined widgets that can be produced in a week is 550.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{550} \\]"
