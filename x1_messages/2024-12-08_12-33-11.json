Dior is renowned for introducing the \"New Look\" silhouette in 1947, which revolutionized post-World War II fashion with its emphasis on a cinched waist, full skirts, and luxurious fabrics. This design marked a departure from the more practical and austere styles that were prevalent during the war years."
