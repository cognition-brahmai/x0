        "content": "To determine the break-even point for the company, we need to find out how many units must be sold so that the total revenue equals the total cost. The break-even point is the point where the company neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss.\n\nFirst, let's define the components involved:\n\n1. **Fixed Costs (FC):** These are costs that do not change with the level of production or sales. In this case, the fixed cost is $1,000 per month.\n\n2. **Variable Costs (VC):** These are costs that vary directly with the level of production. Here, the variable cost is $50 per unit produced.\n\n3. **Selling Price (SP):** This is the price at which each unit is sold. In this scenario, each unit is sold for $75.\n\nThe total cost (TC) for producing 'x' units is the sum of the fixed costs and the variable costs:\n\n\\[ TC = FC + (VC \\times x) \\]\n\\[ TC = 1000 + (50 \\times x) \\]\n\nThe total revenue (TR) from selling 'x' units is:\n\n\\[ TR = SP \\times x \\]\n\\[ TR = 75 \\times x \\]\n\nAt the break-even point, total revenue equals total cost:\n\n\\[ TR = TC \\]\n\\[ 75x = 1000 + 50x \\]\n\nTo find 'x', we need to solve this equation:\n\nSubtract 50x from both sides:\n\n\\[ 75x - 50x = 1000 \\]\n\\[ 25x = 1000 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 25:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1000}{25} \\]\n\\[ x = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the company must sell 40 units to break even.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- The fixed costs are $1,000, which must be covered regardless of the number of units sold.\n\n- Each unit sold brings in $75 but costs $50 to produce, resulting in a contribution margin of $25 per unit ($75 - $50).\n\n- To cover the fixed costs of $1,000, the company needs to sell enough units so that the total contribution margin equals the fixed costs.\n\n- Therefore, the number of units required to break even is $1,000 divided by $25 per unit, which equals 40 units.\n\nThis calculation ensures that the company covers all its costs (both fixed and variable) without making a profit or a loss."
