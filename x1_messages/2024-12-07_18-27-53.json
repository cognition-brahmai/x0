        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system by replacing all its diesel buses with electric ones. Currently, there are 100 diesel buses, each with a fuel efficiency of 4 miles per gallon, and they travel an average of 150 miles per day. The electric buses can go 200 miles on a single charge and cost $500,000 each. We need to calculate the total cost of replacing all the diesel buses with electric ones and also figure out the potential fuel savings in gallons over one year, assuming diesel costs $3 per gallon.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of replacing all the diesel buses with electric ones. Since there are 100 diesel buses and each electric bus costs $500,000, the total cost would be:\n\nTotal cost = Number of buses \u00d7 Cost per electric bus\nTotal cost = 100 \u00d7 $500,000\nTotal cost = $50,000,000\n\nSo, the total cost of replacing all the diesel buses with electric ones is $50,000,000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the potential fuel savings. To do that, we need to determine how much fuel the diesel buses consume currently and then see how much that would save by switching to electric buses.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much fuel each diesel bus consumes per day.\n\nFuel consumption per day per bus = (Daily route distance) / (Fuel efficiency)\nFuel consumption per day per bus = 150 miles / 4 miles per gallon\nFuel consumption per day per bus = 37.5 gallons per day\n\nNow, let's calculate the total fuel consumption for all 100 diesel buses per day.\n\nTotal fuel consumption per day = Fuel consumption per bus per day \u00d7 Number of buses\nTotal fuel consumption per day = 37.5 gallons \u00d7 100\nTotal fuel consumption per day = 3,750 gallons per day\n\nNow, to find the annual fuel consumption, we need to multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a year. Assuming the buses operate 365 days a year:\n\nAnnual fuel consumption = Total fuel consumption per day \u00d7 365 days\nAnnual fuel consumption = 3,750 gallons per day \u00d7 365 days\nAnnual fuel consumption = 1,368,750 gallons per year\n\nNow, since the electric buses don't use diesel, the fuel savings would be equal to the current annual fuel consumption of the diesel buses.\n\nTherefore, potential fuel savings = 1,368,750 gallons per year\n\nSo, by replacing all the diesel buses with electric ones, the city can save 1,368,750 gallons of diesel per year.\n\nAdditionally, if we want to find out the dollar value of these fuel savings, we can multiply the savings in gallons by the cost per gallon of diesel.\n\nFuel cost savings per year = Potential fuel savings \u00d7 Cost per gallon of diesel\nFuel cost savings per year = 1,368,750 gallons \u00d7 $3 per gallon\nFuel cost savings per year = $4,106,250 per year\n\nTherefore, the city can save $4,106,250 per year on fuel costs by switching to electric buses.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Total cost of replacement: $50,000,000\n\n- Potential fuel savings per year: 1,368,750 gallons\n\n- Dollar value of fuel savings per year: $4,106,250\n\nThis calculation assumes that the electric buses fully replace the diesel buses and operate under the same conditions. It's also important to consider other factors such as maintenance costs, electricity costs for charging the buses, and the environmental benefits of switching to electric buses.\n\n\n"
