He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, which was indeed surprising to many because he is primarily known as a musician and songwriter rather than a traditional literary figure. The Swedish Academy recognized him \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\" This decision sparked some debate, but it also opened up discussions about the intersection of music and literature."
