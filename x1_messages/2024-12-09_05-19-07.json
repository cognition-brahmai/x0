        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a train traveling between two cities. So, the train goes from City A to City B in 6 hours, and on its way back from City B to City A, it takes 8 hours because it's going slower. The total distance between the two cities is 240 miles. I need to find out what the train's speed was on its way back.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall the basic formula for speed, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nSo, for the trip from City A to City B, the train covers 240 miles in 6 hours. That means its speed going there was:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_{\\text{AB}} = \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 40 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nNow, on the way back from City B to City A, it takes 8 hours. I need to find the speed for this part of the trip. Using the same formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed}_{\\text{BA}} = \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{8 \\text{ hours}} = 30 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But maybe there's a trick here. Let me double-check.\n\nThe problem states that the distance between the two cities is 240 miles, and the train takes 6 hours to go from A to B and 8 hours to go back from B to A due to a slower speed. So, yes, the speed on the way back should indeed be slower, as indicated by the longer travel time.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the speed on the way back is 30 miles per hour.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the concept of average speed or something like that.\n\nThe average speed for the entire round trip could be calculated, but the problem doesn't ask for that. It specifically asks for the speed on the way back.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's information about the train slowing down due to certain conditions, but in the problem as stated, no such information is provided.\n\nSo, sticking to the basic formula seems appropriate here.\n\nLet me verify the calculations again.\n\nGoing from A to B:\n\n- Distance: 240 miles\n\n- Time: 6 hours\n\n- Speed: 240 / 6 = 40 mph\n\nGoing from B to A:\n\n- Distance: 240 miles\n\n- Time: 8 hours\n\n- Speed: 240 / 8 = 30 mph\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nMaybe I should consider if the train is stopping at stations or something, but again, the problem doesn't provide that information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the distance is the same in both directions. But since it's the same route between two cities, it's reasonable to assume the distance is the same.\n\nWait, unless the problem is trying to trick me by implying that the distance might be different, but no, it specifies that the distance between the two cities is 240 miles.\n\nSo, I think the answer is indeed 30 miles per hour.\n\nI don't see any other complicating factors in the problem. It appears to be a straightforward application of the speed formula.\n\nTherefore, the train's speed on its way back was 30 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]"
