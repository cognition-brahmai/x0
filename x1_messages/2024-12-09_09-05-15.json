        "content": "I'm sorry, but the information you provided seems to be incorrect. Abraham Lincoln was actually the 16th President of the United States, not the 18th. He was born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Hodgenville, Kentucky, not in a large plantation house in Virginia. He is best known for leading the country through the Civil War and for his efforts to abolish slavery, culminating in the Emancipation Proclamation and the passage of the 13th Amendment. Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., and he died the following day.\n\nThe details you mentioned seem to be a mix of facts from different historical figures. For example, the Spanish-American War occurred long after Lincoln's presidency, and the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, decades before Lincoln was born. Additionally, the duel you mentioned involving Aaron Burr took place in 1804 with Alexander Hamilton, not Abraham Lincoln.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.\n"
