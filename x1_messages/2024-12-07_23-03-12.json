        "content": "The classic board game you're referring to is probably \"Clue\" (also known as \"Cluedo\" in some countries). In Clue, players must Deduce the identity of the murderer, the weapon used, and the room where the murder occurred based on clues gathered during the game. However, if you're thinking of a game specifically about deducing a person's identity based on clues about their physical appearance, there might be other games that fit that description better.\n\nAnother game that comes to mind is \"Mysterium,\" where one player acts as a ghost and gives clues to the other players about which player, weapon, or location is involved in a murder, using dream-like cards that represent different attributes. The other players have to interpret these clues to deduce the correct combination.\n\nIf neither of these seems to be the exact game you're thinking of, perhaps you could provide a bit more information or describe some key features of the game, and I'll do my best to help you identify it."
