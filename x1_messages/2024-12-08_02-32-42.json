        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a town with 20 families, and each family has at least one child. Among these, 8 families have exactly two children, and 5 families have three children. We need to find out how many families have only one child.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given:\n\n- Total families: 20\n\n- Families with exactly two children: 8\n\n- Families with three children: 5\n\n- Families with only one child: ?\n\nWe know that every family has at least one child, so there are no families with zero children.\n\nLet's think about how to approach this. One way is to consider the total number of children and then see how they are distributed among the families.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give the total number of children directly. So, maybe there's another way.\n\nLet's consider the families based on the number of children they have:\n\n- Families with one child: let's call this number x.\n\n- Families with two children: 8.\n\n- Families with three children: 5.\n\nSince these are the only categories (because each family has at least one child), the sum of these should equal the total number of families.\n\nSo, x + 8 + 5 = 20.\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nx + 13 = 20\n\nx = 20 - 13\n\nx = 7.\n\nSo, there are 7 families with only one child.\n\nWait a minute, is this all there is to it? It seems straightforward, but let's double-check to make sure we didn't miss anything.\n\nWe have:\n\n- 7 families with one child: 7 * 1 = 7 children.\n\n- 8 families with two children: 8 * 2 = 16 children.\n\n- 5 families with three children: 5 * 3 = 15 children.\n\nTotal children: 7 + 16 + 15 = 38 children.\n\nBut the problem doesn't ask for the total number of children; it only asks for the number of families with only one child. So, our calculation seems to answer the question correctly.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be families with more than three children. The problem states that there are families with exactly two children and exactly three children, and the rest have only one child. So, there are no families with more than three children.\n\nTherefore, our initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think in terms of sets or use algebra, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nSo, the number of families with only one child is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]\n"
