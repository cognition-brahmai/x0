        "content": "So I need to prove that every continuous function on a closed interval [a, b] is uniformly continuous. Okay, let's start by understanding what these terms mean.\n\nFirst, a function f is continuous on [a, b] if for every point c in [a, b] and every \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that whenever |x - c| < \u03b4 and x is in [a, b], we have |f(x) - f(c)| < \u03b5.\n\nNow, uniform continuity is a bit stronger. A function f is uniformly continuous on [a, b] if for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists a single \u03b4 > 0 that works for all points c in [a, b]. That is, for all x, c in [a, b], if |x - c| < \u03b4, then |f(x) - f(c)| < \u03b5.\n\nSo, the key difference is that in uniform continuity, the \u03b4 depends only on \u03b5 and not on the specific point c.\n\nGiven that [a, b] is a closed and bounded interval, I recall that closed intervals in real numbers are compact. Maybe I can use that property here.\n\nI think the Heine-Cantor theorem is relevant here, which states that every continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous. Since [a, b] is compact, applying this theorem would directly give me the result.\n\nBut perhaps I should try to prove it from first principles to better understand what's going on.\n\nLet's assume f is continuous on [a, b], and suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that f is not uniformly continuous on [a, b].\n\nThen, there exists some \u03b5 > 0 such that for every \u03b4 > 0, there are points x and c in [a, b] with |x - c| < \u03b4, but |f(x) - f(c)| \u2265 \u03b5.\n\nIn particular, for each positive integer n, let's choose \u03b4 = 1/n.\n\nSo, for each n, there exist points x_n and c_n in [a, b] such that |x_n - c_n| < 1/n, but |f(x_n) - f(c_n)| \u2265 \u03b5.\n\nNow, since [a, b] is compact, the sequence {c_n} has a convergent subsequence, say {c_{n_k}} converging to some point c in [a, b].\n\nCorrespondingly, the sequence {x_{n_k}} satisfies |x_{n_k} - c_{n_k}| < 1/n_k, and since n_k \u2192 \u221e as k \u2192 \u221e, we have 1/n_k \u2192 0.\n\nTherefore, x_{n_k} \u2192 c as well.\n\nNow, since f is continuous at c, we have that f(c_{n_k}) \u2192 f(c) and f(x_{n_k}) \u2192 f(c).\n\nBut wait, we also have that |f(x_{n_k}) - f(c_{n_k})| \u2265 \u03b5 for all k.\n\nThis is a contradiction because if both f(x_{n_k}) and f(c_{n_k}) approach f(c), their difference should approach zero, but here it's at least \u03b5.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that f is not uniformly continuous must be false, and hence f is uniformly continuous on [a, b].\n\nAlternatively, I can think about using the concept of open covers.\n\nSince [a, b] is compact, for every \u03b5 > 0, the open cover consisting of neighborhoods where the function is continuous can be reduced to a finite subcover.\n\nThen, the minimum \u03b4 over this finite subcover would work as the uniform \u03b4 for that \u03b5.\n\nThis seems a bit more abstract, but it's another way to see why the result holds.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make that more precise.\n\nGiven \u03b5 > 0, for each point c in [a, b], there exists \u03b4_c > 0 such that for all x in [a, b], if |x - c| < \u03b4_c, then |f(x) - f(c)| < \u03b5/2.\n\nNow, the collection of open intervals (c - \u03b4_c/2, c + \u03b4_c/2) for all c in [a, b] forms an open cover of [a, b].\n\nSince [a, b] is compact, there exists a finite subcover, say corresponding to points c1, c2, ..., cn.\n\nLet \u03b4 be the minimum of \u03b4_{c1}/2, \u03b4_{c2}/2, ..., \u03b4_{cn}/2.\n\nI claim that this \u03b4 works for uniform continuity.\n\nTake any x, y in [a, b] with |x - y| < \u03b4.\n\nThen, x lies in one of the intervals, say (c_i - \u03b4_{c_i}/2, c_i + \u03b4_{c_i}/2).\n\nSimilarly, y lies in some interval (c_j - \u03b4_{c_j}/2, c_j + \u03b4_{c_j}/2).\n\nBut since |x - y| < \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b4_{c_i}/2 and \u03b4_{c_j}/2, and the intervals overlap appropriately, we can relate f(x) and f(y) through f(c_i) and f(c_j).\n\nWait, this might be getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps sticking with the sequential approach is better for clarity.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nWe assumed that f is not uniformly continuous, which led to the existence of sequences x_n and c_n where |x_n - c_n| < 1/n but |f(x_n) - f(c_n)| \u2265 \u03b5.\n\nUsing compactness, we extracted convergent subsequences, and showed that the continuity of f implies that f(x_{n_k}) and f(c_{n_k}) both approach f(c), which contradicts |f(x_{n_k}) - f(c_{n_k})| \u2265 \u03b5.\n\nTherefore, f must be uniformly continuous.\n\nThis seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to avoid sequences, I can use the open cover approach more directly.\n\nGiven \u03b5 > 0, for each c in [a, b], choose \u03b4_c > 0 such that for all x in [a, b], if |x - c| < \u03b4_c, then |f(x) - f(c)| < \u03b5.\n\nNow, the open cover { (c - \u03b4_c/2, c + \u03b4_c/2) : c in [a, b] } has a finite subcover, say { (c1 - \u03b41/2, c1 + \u03b41/2), ..., (cn - \u03b4n/2, cn + \u03b4n/2) }.\n\nLet \u03b4 = min{ \u03b41/2, ..., \u03b4n/2 }.\n\nI need to show that for all x, y in [a, b], if |x - y| < \u03b4, then |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5.\n\nTake any x, y in [a, b] with |x - y| < \u03b4.\n\nThen, x lies in some interval (c_i - \u03b4_i/2, c_i + \u03b4_i/2).\n\nSimilarly, y lies in some interval (c_j - \u03b4_j/2, c_j + \u03b4_j/2).\n\nSince |x - y| < \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b4_i/2 and \u03b4_j/2, and considering the overlaps, I need to ensure that both x and y are within \u03b4_i of c_i or \u03b4_j of c_j, but I'm not sure if this is the most straightforward way.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider that for any x, y in [a, b] with |x - y| < \u03b4, both x and y are within \u03b4_i of some c_i, and then use the triangle inequality.\n\nSpecifically, for some c_i, if |x - c_i| < \u03b4_i/2 and |y - c_i| < \u03b4_i/2 + \u03b4.\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nI think the sequential approach is cleaner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Lebesgue number lemma.\n\nSince [a, b] is compact and the open cover { (c - \u03b4_c, c + \u03b4_c) : c in [a, b] } covers [a, b], there exists a Lebesgue number \u03b4 > 0 such that every subset of [a, b] with diameter less than \u03b4 is contained in some open set of the cover.\n\nThen, for any x, y in [a, b] with |x - y| < \u03b4, the set {x, y} has diameter less than \u03b4, so it's contained in some (c - \u03b4_c, c + \u03b4_c), which implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \u03b5 and |f(y) - f(c)| < \u03b5, so by triangle inequality, |f(x) - f(y)| < 2\u03b5.\n\nHmm, that gives me |f(x) - f(y)| < 2\u03b5, but I need it less than \u03b5.\n\nTo fix this, I can choose \u03b4_c corresponding to \u03b5/2 instead of \u03b5.\n\nThen, |f(x) - f(c)| < \u03b5/2 and |f(y) - f(c)| < \u03b5/2, so |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5.\n\nThat works.\n\nSo, using the Lebesgue number lemma, I can indeed prove uniform continuity.\n\nThis seems like a more elegant approach.\n\nAlternatively, since [a, b] is compact and f is continuous, f is bounded and attains its bounds, but I don't think that directly helps with uniform continuity.\n\nWait, no, that's the extreme value theorem, which is related but not directly applicable here.\n\nI think the Heine-Cantor theorem is the most straightforward way to go.\n\nGiven that, I can simply state that since [a, b] is compact and f is continuous, by Heine-Cantor theorem, f is uniformly continuous on [a, b].\n\nHowever, since the user asked for a proof, perhaps they want a more detailed argument.\n\nIn that case, going through the sequential approach or the open cover approach would be appropriate.\n\nI think I've covered both methods sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Every continuous function on a closed interval } [a, b] \\text{ is uniformly continuous.}}"
