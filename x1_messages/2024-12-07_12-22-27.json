        "content": "So there are 50 houses in this village, and each house has either a red or blue door. The first house has a red door, and every third house after that also has a red door. I need to find out how many houses have blue doors.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the pattern of the door colors. The first house has a red door, and then every third house after that also has a red door. So, that means house number 1 is red, and then houses 1 + 3 = 4, 4 + 3 = 7, 7 + 3 = 10, and so on, up to house number 50.\n\nSo, the houses with red doors are: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49.\n\nLet me see, is there a formula to find out how many houses have red doors without listing them all?\n\nYes, this seems like an arithmetic sequence where the first term a_1 is 1 and the common difference d is 3.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nSo, a_n = 1 + (n - 1) * 3\n\nWe need to find the largest n such that a_n \u2264 50.\n\nSo, set a_n \u2264 50:\n\n1 + (n - 1) * 3 \u2264 50\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n(n - 1) * 3 \u2264 49\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nn - 1 \u2264 49 / 3\n\nn - 1 \u2264 16.333...\n\nSince n must be an integer, n - 1 \u2264 16, so n \u2264 17.\n\nSo, there are 17 houses with red doors.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses with blue doors is 50 - 17 = 33.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nLet me list out the houses with red doors to confirm:\n\n1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49.\n\nThat's 17 houses, as calculated.\n\nSo, total houses are 50, minus 17 red doors, leaves 33 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose we consider the houses in groups of 3.\n\nEvery 3 houses, one has a red door (every third house after the first).\n\nWait, but the first house is red, then the fourth is red, and so on.\n\nActually, in every block of 3 houses, only one has a red door, which is the one that's every third house after the first.\n\nWait, but house 1 is red, house 4 is red, house 7 is red, etc.\n\nSo, for every 3 houses, one is red.\n\nBut house 1 is red, then house 4 is red, so between house 1, 2, 3: house 1 is red.\n\nHouse 4, 5, 6: house 4 is red.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, effectively, in every group of 3 houses, one has a red door.\n\nTherefore, the number of red doors is the total number of houses divided by 3, rounded down, but considering the first house is red.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave 17 red doors.\n\nWith 50 houses, if we divide by 3, we get 16 full groups with 2 houses left over.\n\nEach group has one red door, so 16 red doors, plus the first house, which is already included.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me stick with the arithmetic sequence approach, which gave me 17 red doors and 33 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the positions of red doors are given by 1 + 3k, where k is 0,1,2,...\n\nSo, k = 0: house 1\n\nk = 1: house 4\n\nk = 2: house 7\n\n...\n\nk = n: house 1 + 3n \u2264 50\n\nSo, 1 + 3n \u2264 50\n\n3n \u2264 49\n\nn \u2264 49/3 \u2248 16.333...\n\nSince n is an integer, n \u2264 16\n\nSo, n can be 0 to 16, which is 17 values (0 through 16 inclusive)\n\nTherefore, 17 red doors, and 50 - 17 = 33 blue doors.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the modulo operation.\n\nIf we consider the position modulo 3.\n\nHouse number h.\n\nIf h \u2261 1 mod 3, then it's red.\n\nBecause house 1 is red, house 4 is red (4 mod 3 = 1), house 7 (7 mod 3 = 1), and so on.\n\nSo, for h from 1 to 50, if h mod 3 = 1, then it's red.\n\nSo, number of red doors is the number of h in 1 to 50 where h mod 3 = 1.\n\nTo find how many such h exist.\n\nLet's find the number of integers h between 1 and 50 such that h mod 3 = 1.\n\nThis is the same as h = 3k + 1 for some integer k \u2265 0.\n\nSo, 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., up to 49.\n\nWhich is the same arithmetic sequence as before.\n\nSo, again, 17 red doors and 33 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, since every 3 houses, one is red, the proportion of red doors is 1/3.\n\nBut 1/3 of 50 is approximately 16.666, but since we can't have a fraction of a house, it's either 16 or 17.\n\nBut earlier calculation shows it's 17.\n\nSo, 17 red doors, 33 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of it as the first house is red, then every third house after that is red.\n\nSo, starting from house 1 (red), then house 4 (red), 7, 10, ..., up to house 49.\n\nSo, that's 17 houses.\n\nTherefore, 50 - 17 = 33 blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that in the first 48 houses (which is divisible by 3), there are 16 groups of 3 houses, each with one red door, so 16 red doors, plus the first house, which is already included.\n\nWait, no, the first house is included in the first group.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nI think the arithmetic sequence approach is the most straightforward.\n\nSo, final answer is 33 blue doors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]"
