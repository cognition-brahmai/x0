        "content": "So there's this box with 10 red balls and 20 blue balls, making a total of 30 balls I guess. If I pick one ball at random, what's the chance it's red? Well, probability is all about favorable outcomes over total outcomes, right? So, the favorable outcome here is picking a red ball, and there are 10 of those. The total number of balls is 30. So, the probability should be 10/30, which simplifies to 1/3. So, there's a one in three chance that I pick a red ball.\n\nNow, if I put that ball back and mix them again, and then pick another ball, what's the probability that both balls I picked were red? Okay, since I'm putting the ball back each time, that means each pick is independent, right? So, the probability of both events happening should be the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSince each time I pick a red ball with a probability of 1/3, then picking two red balls in a row should be (1/3) times (1/3), which is 1/9.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. The first pick: probability of red is 10/30 = 1/3. I put it back, so the second pick is the same situation: probability of red again is 10/30 = 1/3. So, yes, the probability of both picks being red is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to pick two balls with replacement is 30 * 30 = 900, since each pick is independent and there are 30 options each time. The number of favorable outcomes is picking a red ball both times, which is 10 * 10 = 100. So, the probability is 100/900 = 1/9.\n\nHey, that matches what I got earlier. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the balls weren't being replaced. What would the probability be then? If I pick one red ball, there are now 9 red balls and 20 blue balls left, totaling 29 balls. So, the probability of picking a second red ball would be 9/29. Therefore, the probability of both picks being red without replacement would be (10/30) * (9/29) = (1/3) * (9/29) = 9/87 = 3/29.\n\nBut in this case, since we are replacing the ball each time, it's with replacement, so it's 1/9.\n\nI think that makes sense. Probability can sometimes be tricky, but breaking it down like this helps.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{9}} \\]"
