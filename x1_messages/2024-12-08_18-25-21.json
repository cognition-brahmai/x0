Together, we faced an unimaginable enemy, an alien force that sought to destroy everything we hold dear.\n\nBut I am here to tell you that our city still stands. Our homes, our families, our dreams are safe because of the courage and resilience of each and every one of you. You showed that even in the darkest of times, the light of humanity cannot be extinguished.\n\nI may have been the one to lead the final charge, to make the decisive strike that sent our invaders fleeing back to the stars. But it was your unwavering support, your belief in a better tomorrow, that truly saved us.\n\nRemember, the real heroes are not the ones who wear capes or possess extraordinary abilities. The real heroes are the teachers who inspire, the doctors who heal, the firefighters who run into burning buildings, and the police officers who protect us every day.\n\nLet us carry forward the spirit of unity and bravery that carried us through this ordeal. Let us build a future where no force, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, can ever threaten our way of life again.\n\nThank you, and may God bless our city.\n\n**[Applause]**"
