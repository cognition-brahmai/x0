        "content": "Actually, the \"Minute Waltz\" is a piece of music composed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, and it's called that because it's a short waltz, but it doesn't necessarily take exactly one minute to play. The duration can vary depending on the tempo and the performer. So, while it's brief, it's not strictly one minute long. Does that answer your question?"
