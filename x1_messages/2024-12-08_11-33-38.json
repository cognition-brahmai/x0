        "content": "So the restaurant serves 20 tables per hour during its peak time, and I need to find out how many tables it serves in a week, considering only the peak time. Okay, first things first, I need to know how many hours the peak time lasts each day.\n\nHmm, the problem doesn't specify how long the peak time is. It just says \"during its peak time.\" That's a bit tricky because without knowing the duration of the peak time per day, it's hard to calculate the total tables served in a week.\n\nMaybe I should assume a certain number of hours for the peak time. Some restaurants have peak times like lunch or dinner, which might be a couple of hours. For example, let's say the peak time is 2 hours per day. That's just an assumption, though.\n\nSo, if the peak time is 2 hours per day, and the restaurant serves 20 tables per hour during that time, then per day, it would serve 20 tables/hour * 2 hours = 40 tables per day during peak time.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly total, I need to multiply the daily peak tables by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so 40 tables/day * 7 days/week = 280 tables per week during peak time.\n\nBut wait a minute, I made an assumption about the peak time being 2 hours per day. Maybe the problem expects a different assumption or perhaps provides additional information that I missed.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"A restaurant serves 20 tables per hour during its peak time. How many tables does it serve in a week (considering peak time only)?\"\n\nStill no information on how long the peak time is each day. Maybe the peak time is different for different days, or maybe it's a certain number of hours daily.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"peak time\" refers to a specific time period like dinner time, and I need to consider the number of hours in that period.\n\nBut without specific information, I think the best approach is to ask for clarification or to make a reasonable assumption.\n\nSince this seems like a math problem, perhaps there's a standard assumption for peak time hours. In many restaurants, peak times might be 1-3 hours per day. If I assume 2 hours per day, as I did earlier, then the calculation stands at 280 tables per week.\n\nAlternatively, if the peak time is longer, say 3 hours per day, then it would be 20 tables/hour * 3 hours/day = 60 tables/day, and 60 tables/day * 7 days/week = 420 tables per week.\n\nOr, if the peak time is only 1 hour per day, then 20 tables/hour * 1 hour/day = 20 tables/day, and 20 tables/day * 7 days/week = 140 tables per week.\n\nSo, depending on the length of the peak time, the total can vary.\n\nMaybe the problem expects me to consider a standard number of hours for peak time, like 4 hours per day. If that's the case, then 20 tables/hour * 4 hours/day = 80 tables/day, and 80 tables/day * 7 days/week = 560 tables per week.\n\nWait, but that seems high compared to my earlier assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the peak time is only during dinner, which might be 2-3 hours, or maybe it includes both lunch and dinner peaks.\n\nIf there are two peak periods per day, say lunch and dinner, each lasting 2 hours, then total peak time per day would be 4 hours. So, 20 tables/hour * 4 hours/day = 80 tables/day, and 80 tables/day * 7 days/week = 560 tables per week.\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if there are only one peak period per day, say 2 hours, then it's 40 tables per day and 280 per week.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer depends on the specific circumstances of the restaurant's peak times.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should consider a general case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that the peak time is a specific number of hours that needs to be determined.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem implies that the peak time is a certain number of hours per week, and I need to calculate based on that.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. The problem says \"during its peak time,\" implying that during those specific hours, the restaurant serves 20 tables per hour.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that peak time is a certain number of hours per week, and then calculate the total tables served during those hours.\n\nFor example, if peak time is 10 hours per week, then total tables served would be 20 tables/hour * 10 hours = 200 tables per week.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact number of peak hours per week, I can't give a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume a certain number of peak hours per day and then calculate accordingly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to express the total tables served in terms of the number of peak hours per week.\n\nLet's denote the number of peak hours per week as H.\n\nThen, total tables served in a week during peak time = 20 tables/hour * H hours.\n\nSo, total tables = 20H.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and maybe the problem expects a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem provides more context elsewhere that specifies the number of peak hours per week.\n\nSince it doesn't, I think the best approach is to assume a reasonable number of peak hours per week and proceed from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to test basic multiplication skills, and the peak time is intended to be a certain number of hours that can be inferred.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects me to consider that peak time is, say, 2 hours per day, and then calculate accordingly.\n\nIf that's the case, then as I did earlier, 20 tables/hour * 2 hours/day = 40 tables/day, and 40 tables/day * 7 days/week = 280 tables per week.\n\nAlternatively, if peak time is 3 hours per day, then 20 * 3 * 7 = 420 tables per week.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to express it in terms of the number of peak hours per day.\n\nFor example, if peak time is P hours per day, then total tables per week = 20 * P * 7 = 140P tables per week.\n\nThat way, the answer is scalable based on the value of P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that peak time is a certain number of days per week, each with a specific number of hours.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just assume a standard number of peak hours per day and calculate accordingly.\n\nGiven that, I'll assume peak time is 2 hours per day, leading to 20 * 2 * 7 = 280 tables per week.\n\nAlternatively, if peak time is 3 hours per day, it would be 420 tables per week.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to provide a formula-based answer.\n\nTotal tables per week = 20 tables/hour * H hours/week.\n\nTherefore, total tables per week = 20H.\n\nThis way, regardless of the number of peak hours per week, the formula holds.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that peak time is, say, 2 hours per day, then H = 2 * 7 = 14 hours per week.\n\nThus, total tables = 20 * 14 = 280 tables per week.\n\nBut again, this is based on the assumption that peak time is 2 hours per day.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is 280 tables per week.\n\nAlternatively, if peak time is considered to be longer, say 4 hours per day, then H = 4 * 7 = 28 hours per week, leading to 20 * 28 = 560 tables per week.\n\nWithout specific information, it's challenging to pin down an exact number.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to consider a standard 40-hour workweek, with peak time being a certain portion of that.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as peak time is typically a smaller portion of the total operating hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the restaurant is open only during peak hours, but that also seems unlikely.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most reasonable approach is to assume a certain number of peak hours per day and calculate accordingly.\n\nAssuming peak time is 2 hours per day, total tables per week = 20 * 2 * 7 = 280 tables.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant serves 280 tables per week during peak time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{280} \\]"
