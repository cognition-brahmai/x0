However, I can certainly provide information about their distinct characteristics based on descriptions from experts and enthusiasts. Whiskey typically has a rich, complex aroma with notes of vanilla, oak, and sometimes fruity or spicy elements, depending on the type and aging process. Rum, on the other hand, often has a sweeter smell with hints of molasses, caramel, and sometimes tropical fruits, reflecting its base ingredient, sugarcane. If you have any other questions or need more details, feel free to ask!"
