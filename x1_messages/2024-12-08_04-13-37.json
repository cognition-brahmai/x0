        "content": "To find the average cost per unit produced by the company, we need to calculate the total cost of producing all units and then divide that by the total number of units produced.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for each product:\n\n- For product X:\n  - Cost per unit: $30\n  - Units produced per day: 100\n  - Total cost for X = 30 * 100 = $3,000\n\n- For product Y:\n  - Cost per unit: $50\n  - Units produced per day: 150\n  - Total cost for Y = 50 * 150 = $7,500\n\nNext, we'll find the total cost for both products combined:\n\n- Total cost = Total cost for X + Total cost for Y = 3,000 + 7,500 = $10,500\n\nNow, let's find the total number of units produced:\n\n- Total units = Units of X + Units of Y = 100 + 150 = 250 units\n\nFinally, the average cost per unit is the total cost divided by the total number of units:\n\n- Average cost per unit = Total cost / Total units = 10,500 / 250 = $42\n\nSo, the average cost per unit produced by the company is $42.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]"
