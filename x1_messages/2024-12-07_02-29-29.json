        "content": "Let's see. There are five houses in a row, each painted a different color: green, white, blue, red, and probably one more color, but it's not mentioned. The clues are:\n\n1. The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.\n\n2. The blue house is somewhere to the right of the red house.\n\nWe need to figure out which house is not in the middle position.\n\nFirst, let's list the positions as 1 to 5, from left to right.\n\nSo, positions: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nClues:\n\n- Green is immediately to the left of white: G W\n\n- Blue is to the right of red: R ... B\n\nWe need to arrange the houses according to these rules.\n\nLet's consider the green and white houses. Since green is immediately to the left of white, they must be next to each other with green on the left.\n\nPossible pairs for G and W:\n\n- Positions 1 and 2: G W _ _ _\n\n- Positions 2 and 3: _ G W _ _\n\n- Positions 3 and 4: _ _ G W _\n\n- Positions 4 and 5: _ _ _ G W\n\nSo, four possible pairs for G and W.\n\nNow, blue is to the right of red, but not necessarily adjacent.\n\nLet's consider each possible position for G and W and see where red and blue can be.\n\nFirst scenario: G and W in positions 1 and 2.\n\n- Positions: 1 G, 2 W\n\n- Red can be in positions 3 or 4 or 5\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible arrangements:\n\n- Red in 3, blue in 4 or 5\n\n- Red in 4, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 5, blue nowhere (but blue must be to the right of red, so red can't be in 5 if blue is to the right)\n\nWait, if red is in 5, there's no position to the right for blue, so red can't be in 5.\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n- Red in 3, blue in 4 or 5\n\n- Red in 4, blue in 5\n\nNow, the remaining color is in the remaining position.\n\nBut we don't know the fifth color, so let's just call it yellow for now.\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. G W R B Y\n\n2. G W R Y B\n\n3. G W Y R B\n\nWait, but in the first arrangement, G W R B Y:\n\n- G is in 1, W in 2, R in 3, B in 4, Y in 5\n\n- Blue is to the right of red: yes, R in 3, B in 4\n\nSecond arrangement: G W R Y B\n\n- G 1, W 2, R 3, Y 4, B 5\n\n- Blue is to the right of red: yes, R 3, B 5\n\nThird arrangement: G W Y R B\n\n- G 1, W 2, Y 3, R 4, B 5\n\n- Blue is to the right of red: yes, R 4, B 5\n\nNow, let's consider the next scenario where G and W are in positions 2 and 3.\n\n- Positions: 1 _ , 2 G, 3 W, 4 _ , 5 _\n\n- Red can be in positions 1, 4, or 5\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible arrangements:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 4 or 5\n\n- Red in 4, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 5, blue nowhere (same as before, red can't be in 5)\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. Y G W R B\n\n2. Y G W R Y (but Y is already used)\n\nWait, assuming Y is the fifth color.\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n- Y G W R B\n\n- Y G W Y R (no, can't have two Y)\n\n- Y G W B R (but blue should be to the right of red, but R is in 5, B is in 4, which is to the left, so no)\n\nWait, in Y G W R B:\n\n- Y 1, G 2, W 3, R 4, B 5\n\n- Blue is to the right of red: yes, R 4, B 5\n\nAnother arrangement:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 4\n\n- Y G W R B\n\n- Or, red in 1, blue in 5\n\n- Y G W R B\n\n- Or, Y G W Y B (invalid)\n\nSo, only Y G W R B\n\nSimilarly, red in 4, blue in 5:\n\n- Y G W R B\n\nSo, seems only one arrangement in this sub-scenario.\n\nNow, third scenario: G and W in positions 3 and 4.\n\n- Positions: 1 _ , 2 _ , 3 G, 4 W, 5 _\n\n- Red can be in 1, 2, or 5\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible arrangements:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 2, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 5, no blue to the right (invalid)\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. R Y G W B\n\n2. Y R G W B\n\nNow, check for duplicates or invalids.\n\n- R Y G W B: Red in 1, blue in 5\n\n- Y R G W B: Red in 2, blue in 5\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nFourth scenario: G and W in positions 4 and 5.\n\n- Positions: 1 _ , 2 _ , 3 _ , 4 G, 5 W\n\n- Red can be in 1, 2, or 3\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible arrangements:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 3\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 2 or 3\n\n- Red in 2, blue in 3\n\n- Red in 3, blue nowhere (since blue must be to the right of red, but position 4 and 5 are G and W)\n\nWait, position 4 and 5 are G and W, so blue must be in 3 if red is in 1 or 2.\n\nBut blue must be to the right of red.\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. Red in 1, blue in 3\n\n- Y R Y G W (invalid, duplicate Y)\n\n- Y R B G W\n\n2. Red in 2, blue in 3\n\n- Y R B G W\n\n3. Red in 3, blue in _ (no position to the right, invalid)\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n- Y R B G W\n\n- Y R B G W (same as above)\n\nSo, only one unique arrangement in this sub-scenario.\n\nNow, compiling all possible arrangements:\n\n1. G W R B Y\n\n2. G W R Y B\n\n3. G W Y R B\n\n4. Y G W R B\n\n5. R Y G W B\n\n6. Y R G W B\n\n7. Y R B G W\n\nNow, we need to see which house is not in the middle in any of these arrangements.\n\nMiddle position is position 3.\n\nLet's see what houses are in position 3 in each arrangement:\n\n1. G W R B Y: R in 3\n\n2. G W R Y B: R in 3\n\n3. G W Y R B: Y in 3\n\n4. Y G W R B: W in 3\n\n5. R Y G W B: G in 3\n\n6. Y R G W B: G in 3\n\n7. Y R B G W: B in 3\n\nSo, position 3 has: R, R, Y, W, G, G, B\n\nSo, the houses in position 3 are R, Y, W, G, B\n\nBut we don't have Y in the original colors mentioned, but assuming Y is the fifth color.\n\nNow, the question is: which house can we be certain is not in the middle?\n\nLooking at the possible houses in position 3: R, Y, W, G, B\n\nBut the houses are green, white, blue, red, and assuming yellow.\n\nWait, but the question is: which house can we be certain is not in the middle?\n\nLooking at the possible houses in position 3, it's R, W, G, B, Y\n\nSo, all houses except Y are possible in the middle.\n\nBut Y is the fifth house, not specified in the original question.\n\nWait, the original question mentions five houses of different colors: green, white, blue, red, and probably one more color.\n\nBut in the possible arrangements, position 3 has R, W, G, B, Y\n\nBut Y is not specified in the original question, so perhaps it's another color.\n\nBut to answer the question: which house can we be certain is not in the middle?\n\nLooking at the possible arrangements, all houses except maybe one are in the middle.\n\nWait, position 3 has R, W, G, B, Y\n\nBut Y is not one of the specified houses (green, white, blue, red), so perhaps Y is a different color, say yellow.\n\nBut the question is about the green, white, blue, red houses.\n\nIn the possible arrangements, position 3 has:\n\n- R\n\n- W\n\n- G\n\n- B\n\n- Y\n\nSo, all four specified houses (G, W, B, R) are in position 3 in some arrangements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be certain that any of them is not in the middle.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look again.\n\nIn arrangement 1: G W R B Y: position 3 is R\n\n2: G W R Y B: position 3 is R\n\n3: G W Y R B: position 3 is Y\n\n4: Y G W R B: position 3 is W\n\n5: R Y G W B: position 3 is G\n\n6: Y R G W B: position 3 is G\n\n7: Y R B G W: position 3 is B\n\nSo, position 3 has R, R, Y, W, G, G, B\n\nSo, among the specified houses, R, W, G, B are all in position 3 in some arrangement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be certain that any specific house is not in the middle.\n\nWait, but the question seems to suggest that one house can be certainly excluded from being in the middle.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the green house is always to the left of the white house, and the blue house is to the right of the red house, and see if that imposes any restrictions on which house cannot be in the middle.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet's consider the positions again.\n\nWe have positions 1 to 5.\n\nGreen is immediately to the left of white: G W\n\nBlue is to the right of red: R ... B\n\nLet's consider the possible positions for G and W:\n\n- 1 and 2\n\n- 2 and 3\n\n- 3 and 4\n\n- 4 and 5\n\nNow, for each of these, let's see where red and blue can be.\n\nFirst, G and W in 1 and 2:\n\n- Positions: 1 G, 2 W\n\n- Red can be in 3, 4, or 5\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible sub-arrangements:\n\n- Red in 3, blue in 4 or 5\n\n- Red in 4, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 5, blue nowhere (invalid)\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. G W R B Y\n\n2. G W R Y B\n\n3. G W Y R B\n\nNow, in these, position 3 is R, R, Y respectively.\n\nSecond, G and W in 2 and 3:\n\n- Positions: 2 G, 3 W\n\n- Red can be in 1, 4, or 5\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible sub-arrangements:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 4 or 5\n\n- Red in 4, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 5, invalid\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. Y G W R B\n\n2. Y G W B R (invalid, blue should be to the right of red, but R is in 5, B is in 4)\n\nSo, only Y G W R B\n\nIn this arrangement, position 3 is W\n\nThird, G and W in 3 and 4:\n\n- Positions: 3 G, 4 W\n\n- Red can be in 1, 2, or 5\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible sub-arrangements:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 2, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 5, invalid\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. R Y G W B\n\n2. Y R G W B\n\nIn these, position 3 is G\n\nFourth, G and W in 4 and 5:\n\n- Positions: 4 G, 5 W\n\n- Red can be in 1, 2, or 3\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible sub-arrangements:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 3\n\n- Red in 2, blue in 3\n\n- Red in 3, invalid\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. Y R B G W\n\n2. R Y B G W\n\nIn these, position 3 is B\n\nSo, compiling all possible arrangements:\n\n1. G W R B Y: position 3 is R\n\n2. G W R Y B: position 3 is R\n\n3. G W Y R B: position 3 is Y\n\n4. Y G W R B: position 3 is W\n\n5. Y G W B R: invalid, blue should be to the right of red\n\n6. R Y G W B: position 3 is G\n\n7. Y R G W B: position 3 is G\n\n8. Y R B G W: position 3 is B\n\nWait, in the fourth scenario, G and W in 4 and 5, with red in 1 or 2, blue in 3.\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n- Y R B G W: position 3 is B\n\n- R Y B G W: position 3 is B\n\nSo, in all possible arrangements, position 3 can be R, W, G, B, or Y\n\nBut Y is the fifth color, not specified.\n\nThe question is: which house can we be certain is not in the middle?\n\nGiven that position 3 can be R, W, G, B, or Y, and Y is a different color, if we assume Y is not one of the specified houses, then among the specified houses (green, white, blue, red), all of them can be in the middle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be certain that any of the specified houses is not in the middle.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that the fifth house is not relevant, or that Y is not one of the options.\n\nWait, the question mentions five houses, each painted a different color, but only specifies green, white, blue, red. So, perhaps the fifth house is of a different color not mentioned.\n\nIn that case, position 3 can be green, white, blue, red, or some other color.\n\nBut the question is asking about the specified houses: green, white, blue, red.\n\nIn the possible arrangements, position 3 can be R, W, G, B, or Y.\n\nSo, all specified houses can be in position 3.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be certain that any of them is not in the middle.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the fifth house is not one of the specified colors, so Y is not green, white, blue, or red.\n\nBut in the possible arrangements, position 3 can still be G, W, B, R.\n\nSo, we cannot be certain that any of them is not in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that the blue house cannot be in the middle.\n\nWait, in the possible arrangements, position 3 can be B.\n\nFor example, in the arrangement where G and W are in positions 4 and 5, and red is in 1 or 2, blue is in 3.\n\nSo, position 3 can be B.\n\nSimilarly, in other arrangements, position 3 can be R, W, G, or Y.\n\nTherefore, all specified houses can be in the middle.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that none of them can be certainly excluded from being in the middle.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that one of them cannot be in the middle.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the constraints again.\n\nGreen is immediately to the left of white: G W\n\nBlue is to the right of red: R ... B\n\nLet me consider the possible positions for G and W:\n\n- Positions 1 and 2: G W _ _ _\n\n- Positions 2 and 3: _ G W _ _\n\n- Positions 3 and 4: _ _ G W _\n\n- Positions 4 and 5: _ _ _ G W\n\nNow, for each case, let's see where red and blue can be.\n\nFirst case: G W in 1 and 2.\n\n- Red can be in 3, 4, or 5\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible sub-cases:\n\n- Red in 3, blue in 4 or 5\n\n- Red in 4, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 5, invalid\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. G W R B Y\n\n2. G W R Y B\n\n3. G W Y R B\n\nIn these, position 3 is R, R, Y respectively.\n\nSecond case: G W in 2 and 3.\n\n- Red can be in 1, 4, or 5\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible sub-cases:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 4 or 5\n\n- Red in 4, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 5, invalid\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. R G W B Y\n\n2. R G W Y B\n\n3. Y R G W B\n\nIn these, position 3 is W, W, G respectively.\n\nWait, in the third arrangement, position 3 is G.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWait, in Y R G W B: position 1 is Y, 2 is R, 3 is G, 4 is W, 5 is B\n\nBut G is immediately to the left of W, which is correct.\n\nSo, this is valid.\n\nThird case: G W in 3 and 4.\n\n- Red can be in 1, 2, or 5\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible sub-cases:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 2, blue in 5\n\n- Red in 5, invalid\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. R Y G W B\n\n2. Y R G W B\n\nIn these, position 3 is G, G respectively.\n\nFourth case: G W in 4 and 5.\n\n- Red can be in 1, 2, or 3\n\n- Blue must be to the right of red\n\nPossible sub-cases:\n\n- Red in 1, blue in 3\n\n- Red in 2, blue in 3\n\n- Red in 3, invalid\n\nSo, possible arrangements:\n\n1. R Y B G W\n\n2. Y R B G W\n\nIn these, position 3 is B, B respectively.\n\nNow, compiling all possible arrangements:\n\n1. G W R B Y: position 3 is R\n\n2. G W R Y B: position 3 is R\n\n3. G W Y R B: position 3 is Y\n\n4. R G W B Y: position 3 is W\n\n5. R G W Y B: position 3 is W\n\n6. Y R G W B: position 3 is G\n\n7. R Y G W B: position 3 is G\n\n8. Y R B G W: position 3 is B\n\nSo, position 3 can be R, Y, W, G, B\n\nBut Y is the fifth color, not specified.\n\nAmong the specified houses, position 3 can be R, W, G, B.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be certain that any of them is not in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that the blue house cannot be in the middle.\n\nBut from the arrangements above, position 3 can be B.\n\nTherefore, all specified houses can be in the middle.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that none of them can be certainly excluded from being in the middle.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider that the green house is immediately to the left of the white house, so they are a pair.\n\nLet me consider that as a single unit: G W\n\nSimilarly, blue is to the right of red, but not necessarily adjacent.\n\nSo, red and blue have an order: red ... blue\n\nNow, considering G W as a single unit, and red ... blue, we need to arrange these units and the fifth house.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the possible positions for each house.\n\nLet me try to find the possible positions for each house.\n\nFirst, green:\n\n- Can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n- But since G is immediately to the left of W, G cannot be in position 5.\n\nSecond, white:\n\n- Must be immediately to the right of G, so W can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nThird, blue:\n\n- Must be to the right of red\n\nFourth, red:\n\n- Can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n- But depending on blue's position\n\nFifth, the fifth house: let's call it yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible positions for each house.\n\nFirst, green:\n\n- Positions 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nSecond, white:\n\n- Positions 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n- And must be immediately to the right of G\n\nThird, blue:\n\n- Positions to the right of red\n\nFourth, red:\n\n- Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nFifth, yellow:\n\n- Any remaining position\n\nNow, let's consider the middle position, position 3.\n\nWhich house cannot be in position 3?\n\nFrom the possible arrangements earlier, position 3 can be R, W, G, B, Y\n\nSo, among the specified houses, all can be in position 3.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be certain that any specific house is not in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a house that cannot be in the middle based on the constraints.\n\nLet me consider if there is any house that cannot be in position 3 due to the constraints.\n\nFirst, green:\n\n- Can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n- In position 3: G W in 3 and 4\n\n- So, possible\n\nSecond, white:\n\n- Can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n- In position 3: G W in 2 and 3\n\n- Possible\n\nThird, blue:\n\n- Must be to the right of red\n\n- Can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n- In position 3: red must be in position 1 or 2\n\n- Possible\n\nFourth, red:\n\n- Can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n- But blue must be to the right of red\n\n- If red is in position 3, blue must be in position 4 or 5\n\n- Possible\n\nTherefore, all specified houses can be in position 3.\n\nSo, we cannot be certain that any specific house is not in the middle.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that none of them can be certainly excluded from being in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the green and white houses are a pair, and their positions are linked.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf G and W are a pair, with G to the left of W, then they occupy consecutive positions with G on the left.\n\nSimilarly, blue is to the right of red.\n\nSo, perhaps I can consider the possible positions for G and W, and then see where red and blue can be.\n\nBut from the earlier analysis, position 3 can be R, W, G, B, or Y.\n\nTherefore, among the specified houses, all can be in position 3.\n\nHence, the answer is that none of the specified houses can be certainly excluded from being in the middle.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is that the blue house cannot be in the middle, but based on the arrangements, it can be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the white house cannot be in the middle.\n\nBut in the arrangements, position 3 can be W.\n\nTherefore, all specified houses can be in the middle.\n\nSo, the answer is that none of them can be certainly excluded from being in the middle.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that one of them cannot be in the middle.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the green house is immediately to the left of the white house, so they are a pair, and the blue house is to the right of the red house.\n\nPerhaps there is a specific arrangement that forces one house out of the middle position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that the red house cannot be in the middle.\n\nBut in the arrangements, position 3 can be R.\n\nTherefore, all specified houses can be in the middle.\n\nI think the answer is that none of them can be certainly excluded from being in the middle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None of the specified houses can be certainly excluded from being in the middle.}} \\]"
