This period was characterized by a surge in new music, dance, and cultural expressions, especially in urban areas. Fitzgerald captured the essence of this era in his novel \"The Great Gatsby,\" which is set in the summer of 1922 and explores themes of decadence, idealism, and social upheaval. His experiences in France likely influenced his writing and perspective on the era."
