        "content": "I'm here to help answer your questions to the best of my ability, but I need to clarify something. \"The Ring Cycle\" is actually not a collection of symphonic poems; it's a series of four opera cycles composed by Richard Wagner. The full title is \"Der Ring des Nibelungen,\" which translates to \"The Ring of the Nibelung.\" Each opera is a music drama that tells a continuous story based on Germanic mythology.\n\nThe four operas in the cycle are:\n\n1. Das Rheingold (The Rhine Gold)\n\n2. Die Walk\u00fcre (The Valkyrie)\n\n3. Siegfried\n\n4. G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung (Twilight of the Gods)\n\nEach of these operas is a complex work that includes elements of orchestral music, vocal music, and dramatic storytelling. While symphonic poems are single-movement orchestral works that illustrate a particular story, poem, or idea, \"The Ring Cycle\" is a much larger and more comprehensive work that spans four evenings in its complete performance.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
