        "content": "Yes, there is a \"dark side\" of the Moon, but it's a bit of a misnomer. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, meaning that it rotates on its axis in the same amount of time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, one side of the Moon always faces Earth, and the other side always faces away.\n\nThe side that always faces Earth is called the near side, and the side that always faces away is called the far side. The far side is often referred to as the \"dark side,\" but this isn't accurate because both sides of the Moon experience sunlight and darkness as the Moon orbits Earth.\n\nDuring a full moon, for example, the near side is fully illuminated by the Sun, while the far side is in darkness. Conversely, during a new moon, the near side is in darkness, and the far side is illuminated. So, while there is a side of the Moon we can't see from Earth, it's not always dark; it just faces away from us.\n\nThe first images of the far side of the Moon were captured by the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft in 1959, and the first manned mission to see it was Apollo 8 in 1968. Today, we have extensive imagery and data about the far side of the Moon from various missions."
