        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you want a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion. The program should ask the user for input and then print the result. Right?\n\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNow, recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In the case of factorial, the factorial of n can be defined as n multiplied by the factorial of (n-1), and so on, until we reach 1.\n\nSo, the recursive definition of factorial can be:\n\n- factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1), if n > 1\n\n- factorial(1) = 1\n\n- factorial(0) = 1 (by definition)\n\nWe need to handle these base cases in our recursive function to avoid infinite recursion.\n\nLet's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, we'll define a function called factorial that takes an integer n as its argument.\n\nInside the function, we'll have an if condition to check if n is 0 or 1, in which case we return 1.\n\nIf n is greater than 1, the function will return n multiplied by the factorial of (n-1).\n\nAdditionally, we need to handle user input. The program should ask the user to enter a non-negative integer, read that input, and then call the factorial function with that value and print the result.\n\nWe should also consider edge cases, like when the user enters 0 or 1, since their factorials are defined and equal to 1.\n\nMoreover, to ensure the program is robust, we should handle cases where the user might enter a negative number or a non-integer value. Although the prompt specifies a non-negative integer, it's good practice to handle invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nLet's sketch out the steps:\n\n1. Define the recursive factorial function.\n\n2. Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n\n3. Read the user's input.\n\n4. Convert the input to an integer.\n\n5. Check if the input is a non-negative integer.\n\n6. If valid, calculate the factorial using the recursive function and print it.\n\n7. If invalid, inform the user and possibly ask for input again.\n\nFor now, we'll assume the user enters a valid non-negative integer, as per the prompt.\n\nLet's start by writing the factorial function.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Recursive Function:**\n   - Create a function named `factorial` that takes an integer `n`.\n   - Base Case: If `n` is 0 or 1, return 1.\n   - Recursive Case: If `n` > 1, return `n` multiplied by `factorial(n-1)`.\n\n2. **Handle User Input:**\n   - Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n   - Read the input and convert it to an integer.\n\n3. **Calculate and Print the Result:**\n   - Call the `factorial` function with the user-provided value.\n   - Print the result.\n\nHere is the complete Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    # Prompt the user for input\n    user_input = input(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \")\n    \n    # Convert the input to an integer\n    try:\n        n = int(user_input)\n        \n        # Check if the input is a non-negative integer\n        if n < 0:\n            print(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n        else:\n            # Calculate and print the factorial\n            result = factorial(n)\n            print(f\"The factorial of {n} is {result}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Factorial Function:**\n   - This is a recursive function that computes the factorial of a given number `n`.\n   - It handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1 by returning 1.\n   - For `n` > 1, it calls itself with `n-1`, multiplying the result by `n` to compute the factorial.\n\n2. **Main Function:**\n   - Prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n   - Reads the input and attempts to convert it to an integer.\n   - Checks if the input is non-negative. If it is, it calculates the factorial using the recursive function and prints the result.\n   - If the input is invalid (e.g., negative or non-integer), it handles the error gracefully and informs the user.\n\nThis program ensures that the user interacts with it in a straightforward manner and receives appropriate feedback based on their input."
