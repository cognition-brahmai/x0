He is indeed famous for his fantasy novels, including \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" series, which feature Bilbo Baggins. Additionally, Tolkien worked as a codebreaker during World War I, not World War II. He was involved in cryptography for the British government during World War I, specifically with the decipherment of German codes. However, it's worth noting that his most famous literary works were published much later, after the war."
