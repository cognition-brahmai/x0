        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a jar with 4 blue marbles, 6 green marbles, and 10 yellow marbles. I need to find the probability that if I pick two marbles at random without replacement, one is blue and the other is green. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of marbles in the jar. Let's add them up: 4 blue + 6 green + 10 yellow = 20 marbles in total.\n\nNow, I'm picking two marbles without replacement, which means the first marble I pick isn't put back into the jar before I pick the second one. That affects the probabilities because the total number of marbles decreases after the first pick.\n\nI need to find the probability that one marble is blue and the other is green. It doesn't specify the order, so that could mean blue first and green second, or green first and blue second.\n\nMaybe I should consider these as two separate events and add their probabilities together.\n\nLet's start by calculating the probability of picking a blue marble first and then a green marble second.\n\nThe probability of picking a blue marble first is the number of blue marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 4/20, which simplifies to 1/5.\n\nAfter picking one blue marble, there are now 19 marbles left in the jar. The number of green marbles is still 6.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a green marble second, given that the first was blue, is 6/19.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening in this order is (1/5) * (6/19).\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of picking a green marble first and then a blue marble second.\n\nThe probability of picking a green marble first is 6/20, which simplifies to 3/10.\n\nAfter picking one green marble, there are now 19 marbles left in the jar. The number of blue marbles is still 4.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a blue marble second, given that the first was green, is 4/19.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening in this order is (3/10) * (4/19).\n\nNow, since these are two distinct sequences that both satisfy the condition of picking one blue and one green marble, I need to add these two probabilities together to get the total probability.\n\nSo, total probability = (1/5 * 6/19) + (3/10 * 4/19).\n\nLet's calculate each part:\n\nFirst part: (1/5) * (6/19) = (1*6)/(5*19) = 6/95.\n\nSecond part: (3/10) * (4/19) = (3*4)/(10*19) = 12/190.\n\nNow, to add these together, I need a common denominator. 95 and 190, so 190 is a common denominator.\n\nConvert 6/95 to a fraction with denominator 190: (6*2)/(95*2) = 12/190.\n\nSo, total probability = 12/190 + 12/190 = 24/190.\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 12/95.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem using combinations.\n\nSince the order doesn't matter in this problem (one blue and one green), maybe I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 marbles out of 20 is C(20,2), which is 20 choose 2.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one blue and one green marble is C(4,1) * C(6,1), which is 4 choose 1 times 6 choose 1.\n\nSo, probability = (C(4,1) * C(6,1)) / C(20,2).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nC(4,1) = 4.\n\nC(6,1) = 6.\n\nC(20,2) = (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\nSo, probability = (4 * 6)/190 = 24/190 = 12/95.\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier.\n\nSo, the probability is 12/95.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nAnother way could be to consider the probabilities of picking two marbles of different colors and then specify that one is blue and the other is green.\n\nBut I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the probability of picking a blue marble and a green marble in any order.\n\nI already did that by adding the probabilities of the two sequences.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it as 2 * (probability of blue first and green second), since the two scenarios are symmetric.\n\nSo, 2 * (1/5 * 6/19) = 2 * (6/95) = 12/95.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 12/95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{12}{95}} \\]"
