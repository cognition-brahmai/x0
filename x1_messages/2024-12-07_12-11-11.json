        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere's a group of people, and their eye colors are divided like this: 40% have brown eyes, 35% have blue eyes, and 25% have green eyes. If I pick three people at random from this group, I need to find the probability that at least one of them has green eyes.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what \"at least one\" means in probability terms. \"At least one\" usually means one or more, so that could be one, two, or all three people having green eyes.\n\nBut calculating that directly might be a bit messy, especially since there are different combinations that can lead to at least one green-eyed person. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nI recall that the probability of at least one event occurring is sometimes easier to find by subtracting the probability of none of the events occurring from 1. In other words, P(at least one) = 1 - P(none).\n\nSo, in this case, P(at least one green-eyed person) = 1 - P(none have green eyes).\n\nThat seems promising. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, I need to find P(none have green eyes), which means all three have either brown or blue eyes.\n\nFrom the given data:\n\n- Brown eyes: 40% or 0.4\n\n- Blue eyes: 35% or 0.35\n\n- Green eyes: 25% or 0.25\n\nSo, the probability of not having green eyes (i.e., having either brown or blue eyes) is 0.4 + 0.35 = 0.75.\n\nTherefore, P(not green) = 0.75.\n\nNow, since the selections are independent (assuming the group is large enough that selecting one person doesn't affect the probabilities for the next selection), the probability that all three have not green eyes is (0.75)^3.\n\nSo, P(none have green eyes) = 0.75^3.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625\n\n0.5625 * 0.75 = 0.421875\n\nTherefore, P(none have green eyes) = 0.421875.\n\nNow, P(at least one has green eyes) = 1 - 0.421875 = 0.578125.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.578125, or expressed as a percentage, about 57.81%.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's double-check my steps.\n\n1. Identified that \"at least one\" is easier to calculate by subtracting \"none\" from 1.\n\n2. Calculated P(not green) correctly as 0.75.\n\n3. Assumed independence due to a large group, so multiplied 0.75 three times for three selections.\n\n4. Subtracted that from 1 to get the desired probability.\n\nSeems solid. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach it another way and see if I get the same answer.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the probability of exactly one having green eyes, plus exactly two having green eyes, plus all three having green eyes.\n\nSo, P(at least one) = P(exactly one) + P(exactly two) + P(exactly three).\n\nLet's try calculating that.\n\nFirst, P(exactly one has green eyes):\n\nThis is a binomial probability. The formula for exactly k successes in n trials is:\n\nP(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nSo, for k=1, n=3, p=0.25:\n\nC(3,1) = 3\n\nP(exactly one) = 3 * (0.25)^1 * (0.75)^2 = 3 * 0.25 * 0.5625 = 3 * 0.140625 = 0.421875\n\nSimilarly, for k=2:\n\nC(3,2) = 3\n\nP(exactly two) = 3 * (0.25)^2 * (0.75)^1 = 3 * 0.0625 * 0.75 = 3 * 0.046875 = 0.140625\n\nAnd for k=3:\n\nC(3,3) = 1\n\nP(exactly three) = 1 * (0.25)^3 * (0.75)^0 = 1 * 0.015625 * 1 = 0.015625\n\nNow, add them up:\n\nP(at least one) = 0.421875 + 0.140625 + 0.015625 = 0.578125\n\nHey, that's the same answer I got before! So, that gives me more confidence.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using permutations or something else?\n\nWell, another way is to consider all possible sequences of eye colors for three people and find the probability where at least one is green.\n\nFor example, the possible sequences where at least one is green:\n\n- Green, anything, anything\n\n- Not green, green, anything\n\n- Not green, not green, green\n\nAnd also include cases where more than one is green, which is already covered above.\n\nBut this seems similar to the binomial approach I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the total probability and subtract the probability of no green eyes, which is what I did first.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The answer should be 0.578125, or expressed as a fraction, 18/32, but let me check that.\n\nWait, 0.578125 as a fraction:\n\n0.578125 = 578125 / 1000000\n\nSimplify that fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 125:\n\n578125 \u00f7 125 = 4625\n\n1000000 \u00f7 125 = 8000\n\nSo, 4625/8000\n\nCan be simplified further by dividing by 125 again:\n\n4625 \u00f7 125 = 37\n\n8000 \u00f7 125 = 64\n\nSo, 37/64\n\nTherefore, 0.578125 = 37/64.\n\nSo, the probability is 37/64.\n\nI think that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nJust to double-check:\n\n37/64 = 0.578125\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final answer is 37/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{37}{64}} \\]"
