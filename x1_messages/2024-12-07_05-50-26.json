        "content": "Let's see. So, a car travels 100 miles in 2 hours, and I need to find out how long it would take to travel 500 miles. Hmm, this seems like a straightforward speed problem. First, I should probably figure out the speed of the car.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time, right? So, if the car travels 100 miles in 2 hours, its speed is 100 miles divided by 2 hours, which is 50 miles per hour. Makes sense.\n\nNow, if the car is going at 50 miles per hour, how long would it take to travel 500 miles? Well, time is distance divided by speed, so 500 miles divided by 50 miles per hour should give me the time.\n\nLet me do the math: 500 divided by 50 is 10. So, it would take 10 hours to travel 500 miles at that speed.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions. If 100 miles takes 2 hours, then 500 miles would take x hours. So, I can set up a proportion: 100 miles is to 2 hours as 500 miles is to x hours.\n\nThat would be 100/2 = 500/x. Solving for x, I cross-multiply: 100x = 1000, so x = 10 hours. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like, is the speed constant? The problem doesn't mention any changes in speed or stops along the way. So, I'll assume the speed remains constant at 50 miles per hour.\n\nBut in real life, things like traffic, stops for fuel or rest, and speed variations can affect travel time. However, since this is a math problem, I'll stick with the assumption of constant speed.\n\nLet me think about units. Miles and hours are consistent in both parts of the problem, so no issues there.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many 100-mile segments are in 500 miles. Well, 500 divided by 100 is 5. So, there are 5 segments of 100 miles in 500 miles. Since each 100-mile segment takes 2 hours, 5 segments would take 5 times 2 hours, which is 10 hours. Again, the same answer.\n\nIs there a chance that the car's speed changes over time? The problem doesn't suggest that, so I don't think so. But if the speed varied, the travel time could be different. Maybe if the car sped up or slowed down at certain points.\n\nWait, but since the problem gives a consistent speed, I shouldn't complicate it unless specified.\n\nLet me consider if the car travels at a different speed for part of the journey. For example, if it travels the first 100 miles at 50 mph and the next 400 miles at a different speed, the total time would change. But again, the problem states that the car travels 100 miles in 2 hours, and I'm to assume that this speed is maintained for the longer distance unless otherwise stated.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the best answer is that it would take 10 hours to travel 500 miles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider the possibility of units being different or some trick involving units. However, since both distances are in miles and time is in hours, there's no unit conversion needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the word \"how long,\" but in this context, it clearly refers to time.\n\nAnother angle: if the car cannot maintain the same speed due to external factors, but again, since it's not mentioned, I'll ignore that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the car would take 10 hours to travel 500 miles at the same speed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
