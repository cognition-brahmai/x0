        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies make up 50 coins totaling $1.00. Hmm, that's interesting. First, I should probably recall the value of each type of coin:\n\n- A quarter is worth $0.25.\n\n- A dime is worth $0.10.\n\n- A nickel is worth $0.05.\n\n- A penny is worth $0.01.\n\nSo, I have to find the number of each type of coin that adds up to 50 coins and $1.00.\n\nLet me think about this. Maybe I can set up some equations. Let's denote:\n\n- Q as the number of quarters.\n\n- D as the number of dimes.\n\n- N as the number of nickels.\n\n- P as the number of pennies.\n\nFrom the problem, I know two things:\n\n1. The total number of coins is 50:\n\nQ + D + N + P = 50\n\n2. The total value of the coins is $1.00, which is 100 cents:\n\n0.25Q + 0.10D + 0.05N + 0.01P = 1.00\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals might get messy, so maybe I can work in cents instead. That might simplify things.\n\nSo, converting all values to cents:\n\n- A quarter is 25 cents.\n\n- A dime is 10 cents.\n\n- A nickel is 5 cents.\n\n- A penny is 1 cent.\n\nAnd the total value is 100 cents.\n\nSo, the equations become:\n\n1. Q + D + N + P = 50\n\n2. 25Q + 10D + 5N + P = 100\n\nNow, I have two equations with four variables. That seems like too many variables, but maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me try to solve for one variable in terms of the others. From equation 1:\n\nP = 50 - Q - D - N\n\nNow, substitute this expression for P into equation 2:\n\n25Q + 10D + 5N + (50 - Q - D - N) = 100\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n25Q + 10D + 5N + 50 - Q - D - N = 100\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(25Q - Q) + (10D - D) + (5N - N) + 50 = 100\n\n24Q + 9D + 4N + 50 = 100\n\nNow, subtract 50 from both sides:\n\n24Q + 9D + 4N = 50\n\nOkay, now I have one equation with three variables:\n\n24Q + 9D + 4N = 50\n\nThis is still a bit tricky because there are three variables, but maybe I can make some logical deductions.\n\nFirst, since Q, D, N, and P have to be non-negative integers (you can't have negative coins), that limits the possible values.\n\nLet me consider the possible values for Q, the number of quarters.\n\nGiven that each quarter is 25 cents, and the total is 100 cents, the maximum number of quarters I can have is 100 / 25 = 4 quarters. But I also have to consider that the total number of coins is 50.\n\nWait, 4 quarters would be 100 cents, but that would only be 4 coins, which is less than 50. So, I need to have fewer quarters and make up the rest with smaller coins.\n\nLet me try Q = 0 and see what happens.\n\nIf Q = 0:\n\n24(0) + 9D + 4N = 50 \u2192 9D + 4N = 50\n\nNow, I need to find non-negative integers D and N such that 9D + 4N = 50.\n\nLet me solve for N in terms of D:\n\n4N = 50 - 9D\n\nN = (50 - 9D)/4\n\nSince N has to be an integer, (50 - 9D) must be divisible by 4.\n\nLet me find values of D that make 50 - 9D divisible by 4.\n\nLet's try D = 0:\n\n(50 - 0)/4 = 50/4 = 12.5, not an integer.\n\nD = 1:\n\n(50 - 9)/4 = 41/4 = 10.25, not an integer.\n\nD = 2:\n\n(50 - 18)/4 = 32/4 = 8, which is an integer.\n\nSo, D = 2, N = 8.\n\nNow, P = 50 - Q - D - N = 50 - 0 - 2 - 8 = 40.\n\nSo, one possible solution is:\n\nQ = 0, D = 2, N = 8, P = 40.\n\nLet me check if this adds up to $1.00:\n\n0 quarters * 25 cents = 0 cents\n\n2 dimes * 10 cents = 20 cents\n\n8 nickels * 5 cents = 40 cents\n\n40 pennies * 1 cent = 40 cents\n\nTotal: 0 + 20 + 40 + 40 = 100 cents, which is $1.00.\n\nAnd the total number of coins is 0 + 2 + 8 + 40 = 50.\n\nSo, this is a valid solution.\n\nBut maybe there are other solutions. Let's see.\n\nContinuing from Q = 0 and D = 2, N = 8, P = 40.\n\nIs there another value for D that works?\n\nNext, D = 2 + 4 = 6 (since we need 9D to change by a multiple of 4 to keep N integer).\n\nWait, actually, let's think differently. The general approach would be to find all integer solutions for D and N in 9D + 4N = 50.\n\nWe can find particular solutions and then find the general solution.\n\nLet's find one particular solution.\n\nWe already have D = 2, N = 8.\n\nNow, the general solution would be:\n\nD = 2 + 4k\n\nN = 8 - 9k\n\nFor some integer k.\n\nNow, N and D must be non-negative integers.\n\nSo, D = 2 + 4k \u2265 0\n\nN = 8 - 9k \u2265 0\n\nFrom D \u2265 0: 2 + 4k \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 -0.5, so k \u2265 0 since k is integer.\n\nFrom N \u2265 0: 8 - 9k \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2264 8/9, so k \u2264 0.\n\nTherefore, the only integer k that satisfies both is k = 0.\n\nTherefore, the only solution for Q = 0 is D = 2, N = 8, P = 40.\n\nNow, let's try Q = 1.\n\nIf Q = 1:\n\n24(1) + 9D + 4N = 50 \u21d2 24 + 9D + 4N = 50 \u21d2 9D + 4N = 26.\n\nNow, solve for N in terms of D:\n\n4N = 26 - 9D \u21d2 N = (26 - 9D)/4\n\nNeed (26 - 9D) divisible by 4.\n\nLet's try D = 0:\n\n(26 - 0)/4 = 6.5, not integer.\n\nD = 1:\n\n(26 - 9)/4 = 17/4 = 4.25, not integer.\n\nD = 2:\n\n(26 - 18)/4 = 8/4 = 2, integer.\n\nSo, D = 2, N = 2.\n\nThen, P = 50 - 1 - 2 - 2 = 45.\n\nCheck the total value:\n\n1 quarter * 25 = 25 cents\n\n2 dimes * 10 = 20 cents\n\n2 nickels * 5 = 10 cents\n\n45 pennies * 1 = 45 cents\n\nTotal: 25 + 20 + 10 + 45 = 100 cents.\n\nAnd total coins: 1 + 2 + 2 + 45 = 50.\n\nSo, another valid solution.\n\nAre there more for Q = 1?\n\nLet's see the general solution for 9D + 4N = 26.\n\nParticular solution: D = 2, N = 2.\n\nGeneral solution: D = 2 + 4k, N = 2 - 9k.\n\nN and D \u2265 0.\n\nSo, D = 2 + 4k \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 -0.5, k \u2265 0.\n\nN = 2 - 9k \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2264 2/9, so k \u2264 0.\n\nThus, only k = 0 is allowed.\n\nTherefore, only one solution for Q = 1: D = 2, N = 2, P = 45.\n\nNow, Q = 2.\n\n24(2) + 9D + 4N = 50 \u21d2 48 + 9D + 4N = 50 \u21d2 9D + 4N = 2.\n\nNow, 9D + 4N = 2.\n\nN = (2 - 9D)/4\n\nNeed 2 - 9D divisible by 4.\n\nTry D = 0:\n\n(2 - 0)/4 = 0.5, not integer.\n\nD = 1:\n\n(2 - 9)/4 = (-7)/4, negative and not integer.\n\nHigher D would make it more negative.\n\nSo, no solution for Q = 2.\n\nNow, Q = 3.\n\n24(3) + 9D + 4N = 50 \u21d2 72 + 9D + 4N = 50 \u21d2 9D + 4N = -22.\n\nThis is impossible since D and N are non-negative, so no solution for Q = 3.\n\nSimilarly, Q = 4.\n\n24(4) + 9D + 4N = 50 \u21d2 96 + 9D + 4N = 50 \u21d2 9D + 4N = -46.\n\nAgain, impossible.\n\nSo, Q can only be 0, 1 in this case.\n\nTherefore, there are two possible combinations:\n\n1. Q = 0, D = 2, N = 8, P = 40.\n\n2. Q = 1, D = 2, N = 2, P = 45.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I only found these two solutions. Is there perhaps a third solution?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider Q = 0 and higher D values.\n\nWait, earlier I had D = 2 for Q = 0, and D = 2 for Q = 1.\n\nIs there a solution with higher D for Q = 0?\n\nWait, earlier I saw that for Q = 0, D = 2, N = 8, P = 40 is the only solution because k = 0 is the only integer satisfying the conditions.\n\nSimilarly, for Q = 1, only D = 2, N = 2, P = 45.\n\nSo, it seems there are only these two combinations.\n\nBut let me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently.\n\nSuppose I consider the number of quarters.\n\nIf Q = 0:\n\nThen, D + N + P = 50\n\nAnd 10D + 5N + P = 100\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(10D + 5N + P) - (D + N + P) = 100 - 50\n\n9D + 4N = 50\n\nWhich is what I had earlier.\n\nSimilarly for Q = 1:\n\nD + N + P = 49\n\n10D + 5N + P = 75\n\nSubtract:\n\n9D + 4N = 26\n\nAgain, as before.\n\nAnd for Q = 0 and Q = 1, only those two solutions.\n\nTherefore, there are two possible ways to have 50 coins totaling $1.00:\n\n1. 0 quarters, 2 dimes, 8 nickels, and 40 pennies.\n\n2. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 2 nickels, and 45 pennies.\n\nI don't think there are more solutions beyond these two.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are two possible combinations of coins that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
