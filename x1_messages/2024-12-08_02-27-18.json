        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this movie theater with 10 screens, and each screen has an average of 150 seats. The theater is usually about 65% full, and they charge $12 per ticket. I need to find out how much money they make in one day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many people are watching movies in one day. To do that, I need to know how many seats are available in total and then see how many of those seats are actually filled based on the occupancy rate.\n\nSo, total seats would be the number of screens times the seating capacity per screen. That would be 10 screens times 150 seats, which is 1,500 seats in total.\n\nNow, with a 65% occupancy rate, the number of seats filled would be 65% of 1,500. To calculate that, I can multiply 1,500 by 0.65. Let's see, 1,500 times 0.65 is 975 seats filled.\n\nEach ticket costs $12, so the total revenue would be the number of tickets sold times the price per ticket. So, 975 tickets times $12 each.\n\nNow, 975 times 12. I can calculate that as 900 times 12 plus 75 times 12.\n\n900 times 12 is 10,800, and 75 times 12 is 900. So, adding those together, 10,800 plus 900 is $11,700.\n\nTherefore, the theater generates $11,700 in revenue in one day.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal seats: 10 screens times 150 seats = 1,500 seats.\n\nOccupancy rate: 65%, so 1,500 times 0.65 = 975 seats filled.\n\nTicket price: $12 per ticket.\n\nRevenue: 975 times $12.\n\nYes, 975 times 12 is indeed 11,700.\n\nSo, the theater makes $11,700 in one day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11700} \\]"
