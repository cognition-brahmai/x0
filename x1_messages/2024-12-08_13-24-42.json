        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is:\n\n(6 / (2 * (1 + 2)) - 3) * 4\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 2 = 3\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(6 / (2 * 3) - 3) * 4\n\nNext, handle the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(6 / 6 - 3) * 4\n\nNow, division:\n\n6 / 6 = 1\n\nSo:\n\n(1 - 3) * 4\n\nSubtraction:\n\n1 - 3 = -2\n\nNow:\n\n-2 * 4\n\nMultiplication:\n\n-2 * 4 = -8\n\nSo the final answer is -8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-8} \\]"
