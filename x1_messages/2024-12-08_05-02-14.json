        "content": "I'm here to help you with information about real-life locations in London, but I need to clarify that the Hundred Acre Wood is a fictional location from the Winnie-the-Pooh stories by A.A. Milne. It's not a real place that you can visit in London or anywhere else in the real world. The stories are set in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, England, which is south of London.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in visiting places related to Winnie-the-Pooh, you might want to consider going to Ashdown Forest, where A.A. Milne and his family spent time, and where the setting for the stories was inspired. To get there from London, you can take a train to Haywards Heath station, which is on the mainline from London Bridge or London Victoria to Brighton. From Haywards Heath, you can catch a bus or arrange transportation to Ashdown Forest.\n\nIf you have any other questions about real-life train stations or travel in London, feel free to ask!"
