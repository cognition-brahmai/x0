        "content": "To find the shortest distance between a point and a plane in three-dimensional space, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane. The formula is given by:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 + d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} \\]\n\nwhere \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) is the point, and \\(ax + by + cz + d = 0\\) is the equation of the plane.\n\nGiven the point \\((1, 2, 3)\\) and the plane \\(x + y + z = 6\\), we first need to write the plane equation in the standard form \\(ax + by + cz + d = 0\\). So, we can rewrite the plane equation as:\n\n\\[ x + y + z - 6 = 0 \\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), and \\(d = -6\\).\n\nNow, plugging these values into the distance formula:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{|(1)(1) + (1)(2) + (1)(3) + (-6)|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{|1 + 2 + 3 - 6|}{\\sqrt{1 + 1 + 1}} \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{|0|}{\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\\[ d = 0 \\]\n\nWait, this result suggests that the distance is zero, which would mean that the point lies on the plane. Let's verify this.\n\nTo check if the point \\((1, 2, 3)\\) lies on the plane \\(x + y + z = 6\\), we can substitute the coordinates into the plane equation:\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\]\n\\[ 6 = 6 \\]\n\nYes, the point satisfies the plane equation, which means it lies on the plane. Therefore, the shortest distance between the point and the plane is indeed zero.\n\nHowever, if the question is to find the shortest distance from the point to the plane, and the point is already on the plane, then the distance is zero. But perhaps there is a misunderstanding here. Let's consider if there might be a typo or if another interpretation is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the plane equation is meant to be different, or perhaps the point is different. But based on the given information, the point lies on the plane, so the distance is zero.\n\nAlternatively, if the plane equation was meant to be something else, such as \\(x + y + z = 6\\), and the point is indeed \\((1, 2, 3)\\), then as shown, the distance is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to find the distance between two planes, or something else, but based on the given information, this is the appropriate calculation.\n\nSo, the shortest distance between the point \\((1, 2, 3)\\) and the plane \\(x + y + z = 6\\) is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
