Fauna includes elusive shadow cats that blend into the darkness and singbirds that mimic any sound they hear, creating a symphony of echoes.\n\nHidden Feature: Beneath the roots of the oldest willow tree lies a hidden grotto containing an ancient well. The well water is said to grant wishes to those pure of heart.\n\nThreat Level: Moderate. While the forest appears serene, it's home to mischievous spirits that can lead travelers astray, and the shadow cats are territorial and may attack if provoked."
