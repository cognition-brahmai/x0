        "content": "To determine the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two six-sided dice, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**\n   Each die has 6 faces, and since the dice are independent of each other, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**\n   We need to find the number of ways to get a sum of 7. Let's list all the possible combinations where the sum of the two dice equals 7:\n   - Die 1 shows 1, Die 2 shows 6 (1 + 6 = 7)\n   - Die 1 shows 2, Die 2 shows 5 (2 + 5 = 7)\n   - Die 1 shows 3, Die 2 shows 4 (3 + 4 = 7)\n   - Die 1 shows 4, Die 2 shows 3 (4 + 3 = 7)\n   - Die 1 shows 5, Die 2 shows 2 (5 + 2 = 7)\n   - Die 1 shows 6, Die 2 shows 1 (6 + 1 = 7)\n   \n   So, there are 6 favorable outcomes.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability:**\n   Probability is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability \\( P \\) of rolling a sum of 7 is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{sum of 7}) = \\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two six-sided dice is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- We considered all possible outcomes when rolling two dice, which is 36.\n- We identified all the combinations that result in a sum of 7, which are 6 in total.\n- By dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes, we obtained the probability.\n\nThis method ensures that we account for all possible scenarios and calculate the probability accurately."
