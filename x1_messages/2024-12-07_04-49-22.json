        "content": "Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that usually takes place in December. It commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem during the second century BCE, when the Jewish people rose up against their Greek-Syrian oppressors in the Maccabean Revolt.\n\nAccording to tradition, when the Jewish fighters, known as the Maccabees, recaptured the Temple, they found only enough purified oil to light the menorah (candelabrum) for one day. However, miraculously, the oil lasted for eight days, which was the time needed to prepare new oil. This miracle is symbolized by the lighting of the hanukkiah, a nine-branched menorah, with one candle lit each night of Hanukkah.\n\nHanukkah is a time for family gatherings, exchanging gifts, playing dreidel (a spinning top game), and enjoying traditional foods like latkes (potato pancakes) and sufganiyot (jelly donuts). It's important to note that while Hanukkah is a significant holiday in Jewish culture, it is not as spiritually significant as some other Jewish holidays like Yom Kippur or Passover."
