        "content": "So the farmer had 15 sheep, and all but 8 died. How many are left? Hmm, this seems like a trick question. At first glance, you might think that if the farmer had 15 sheep and all but 8 died, then 8 are left. But let's think about it carefully.\n\nThe phrase \"all but 8\" means that all the sheep except for 8 died. So, if the farmer had 15 sheep and all but 8 died, that means that 8 sheep survived. Therefore, the number of sheep left is 8.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to interpret this? Maybe the \"all but 8\" is referring to something else. Let's consider the total number of sheep the farmer had initially, which is 15. If all but 8 died, it means that 15 minus the number that died equals 8. So, 15 - number died = 8, which means the number that died is 7. Therefore, 8 are left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"all but 8\" means that only 8 sheep did not die, so the rest, which is 15 - 8 = 7, died. So again, 8 are left.\n\nI think the answer is straightforward: 8 sheep are left.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation. Maybe \"all but 8 died\" could mean that all sheep except for 8 died, which again points to 8 being left. Or perhaps it's a trick to make you think that more died than actually did.\n\nNo, I think the key here is understanding the phrase \"all but 8.\" \"All but\" means \"all except for.\" So, all the sheep except for 8 died, meaning that those 8 are the ones that did not die.\n\nTherefore, the number of sheep left is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
