First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right. This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate (3 + 6):\n\n3 + 6 = 9\n\nNow the expression is (9^2 - 4 * 2) / (8 - 3)\n\n2. Next, calculate the exponent:\n\n9^2 = 81\n\nNow the expression is (81 - 4 * 2) / (8 - 3)\n\n3. Now, handle multiplication and subtraction inside the numerator:\n\nFirst, multiply 4 * 2:\n\n4 * 2 = 8\n\nThen subtract that from 81:\n\n81 - 8 = 73\n\nSo the numerator is 73.\n\n4. Now, calculate the denominator:\n\n8 - 3 = 5\n\nSo the expression is now 73 / 5\n\n5. Finally, perform the division:\n\n73 / 5 = 14.6\n\nSo, the final answer is 14.6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14.6} \\]"
