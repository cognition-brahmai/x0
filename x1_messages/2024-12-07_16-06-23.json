        "content": "Designing an algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using dynamic programming is an efficient way to handle this classic optimization problem, especially for instances with a smaller number of cities. The TSP is known to be NP-hard, meaning that for large inputs, the time required to find an exact solution grows exponentially. However, dynamic programming can significantly reduce the computational complexity compared to a naive approach.\n\n### Approach\n\nThe TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. To solve this using dynamic programming, we need to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and store their solutions to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n#### Key Insight\n\nThe main idea is to represent the state of the traveling salesman in terms of the current city and the set of cities that have already been visited. By keeping track of these states, we can build up the solution in a systematic way.\n\n#### State Representation\n\n- **S**: A subset of cities that have been visited.\n- **i**: The last city visited in this subset.\n- **DP[S][i]**: The shortest path that visits all cities in subset S and ends at city i.\n\n#### Transition\n\nTo find DP[S][i], we consider all possible previous cities k that could have been visited before i. Thus, DP[S][i] can be computed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{DP}[S][i] = \\min_{k \\in S \\setminus \\{i\\}} \\left( \\text{DP}[S \\setminus \\{i\\}][k] + \\text{cost}[k][i] \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( S \\setminus \\{i\\} \\) is the set S without city i.\n- \\( \\text{cost}[k][i] \\) is the cost to travel from city k to city i.\n\n#### Base Case\n\n- For the starting city, say city 0, and the subset containing only city 0:\n  \\[ \\text{DP}[\\{0\\}][0] = 0 \\]\n\n#### Final Solution\n\nThe final solution will be the minimum cost to visit all cities and return to the starting city:\n\n\\[ \\text{min}_{i} \\left( \\text{DP}[U][i] + \\text{cost}[i][0] \\right) \\]\n\nWhere U is the set of all cities.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef tsp(n, cost):\n    # Initialize the DP table\n    # dp[S][i] where S is a subset of cities and i is the last city visited\n    dp = {}\n    \n    # Base case: starting at city 0 with only city 0 visited\n    dp[(1 << 0), 0] = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all subsets S of cities\n    for S in range(1 << n):\n        # Iterate over each city i in S\n        for i in range(n):\n            if S & (1 << i):\n                # City i is in subset S\n                for k in range(n):\n                    if k != i and S & (1 << k):\n                        # City k is also in S and k != i\n                        if (S, i) not in dp:\n                            dp[(S, i)] = float('inf')\n                        if (S ^ (1 << i), k) in dp:\n                            dp[(S, i)] = min(dp[(S, i)], dp[(S ^ (1 << i)), k] + cost[k][i])\n    \n    # Find the minimum cost to visit all cities and return to city 0\n    all_visited = (1 << n) - 1\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if (all_visited, i) in dp:\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, dp[(all_visited, i)] + cost[i][0])\n    \n    return min_cost\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 4\ncost = [\n    [0, 10, 15, 20],\n    [10, 0, 35, 25],\n    [15, 35, 0, 30],\n    [20, 25, 30, 0]\n]\nprint(tsp(n, cost))  # Output should be the minimum tour cost\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize a dictionary `dp` to store the minimum cost for each state (subset S and last city i).\n   - The base case sets the cost to start at city 0 with only city 0 visited to 0.\n\n2. **Filling the DP Table**:\n   - We iterate over all possible subsets S of cities.\n   - For each subset S, we iterate over each city i in S.\n   - For each city i, we consider all possible previous cities k in S (k != i) and compute the minimum cost to reach i from k, adding the cost from k to i.\n\n3. **Computing the Final Solution**:\n   - After filling the DP table, we find the minimum cost to visit all cities and return to city 0 by considering all possible last cities i and adding the cost from i back to city 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the TSP solution using dynamic programming, significantly reducing the computational complexity compared to a brute-force method."
