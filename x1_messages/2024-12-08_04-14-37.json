        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we've got a bakery that makes 100 loaves of bread every day. Each loaf is sliced into 20 pieces. We want to know how many slices that is in a whole week.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many slices are made each day. Since each loaf makes 20 slices, and they make 100 loaves daily, I can multiply those two numbers to get the daily slice production.\n\nSo, 100 loaves times 20 slices per loaf equals 2,000 slices per day.\n\nNow, to find out how many slices are made in a week, I need to know how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, if they make 2,000 slices each day, and they do this every day of the week, I can multiply the daily amount by 7 to get the weekly total.\n\nThat would be 2,000 slices per day times 7 days equals 14,000 slices per week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way could be to find out the total number of loaves made in a week first, and then multiply by the number of slices per loaf.\n\nSo, 100 loaves per day times 7 days equals 700 loaves per week.\n\nThen, 700 loaves times 20 slices per loaf equals again 14,000 slices per week.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, I think 14,000 slices per week is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any variables I'm missing. For example, does the bakery operate every day of the week? The question says \"every day,\" so I assume it includes all seven days. Unless it's specified that they are only open on weekdays, but in this case, it's not mentioned.\n\nAlso, it's important to ensure that the units are consistent. We're dealing with slices per loaf and loaves per day, and then scaling up to a week. So, the units seem consistent.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all loaves are sliced into exactly 20 pieces. The question says each loaf is sliced into 20 pieces, so I'll assume that's uniform.\n\nI shouldn't overcomplicate this. It seems straightforward. But it's always good to double-check the calculations to avoid any mistakes.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- 100 loaves/day\n\n- 20 slices/loaf\n\n- 7 days/week\n\nTotal slices/week = 100 loaves/day * 20 slices/loaf * 7 days/week = 14,000 slices/week.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14000} \\]"
