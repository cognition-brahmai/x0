        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets in batches of 1000, and each widget weighs 5 pounds. They can ship a maximum of 20,000 pounds per truck, and they produce 5000 widgets per day. I need to find out how many trucks they'll need to transport all the widgets produced in one day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total weight of the widgets produced in one day. Since each widget weighs 5 pounds and they produce 5000 widgets, the total weight would be:\n\n5 pounds/widget * 5000 widgets = 25,000 pounds\n\nNow, each truck can carry a maximum of 20,000 pounds. So, to find out how many trucks are needed, I can divide the total weight by the capacity per truck:\n\n25,000 pounds / 20,000 pounds/truck = 1.25 trucks\n\nBut you can't have a fraction of a truck, so they'll need to round up to the next whole number. That means they'll need 2 trucks to transport all the widgets produced in one day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If one truck can carry 20,000 pounds, and the total weight is 25,000 pounds, then the first truck can carry 20,000 pounds, leaving 5,000 pounds for the second truck. So yes, they'll need two trucks.\n\nI think that's the answer: they need 2 trucks per day to transport all the widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
