        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 100 people in a room, and some of them have blue eyes while others have green eyes. It's also mentioned that there are 40 more people with blue eyes than with green eyes. We need to find out how many people have green eyes.\n\nFirst, let's assign some variables to make this easier. Let\u2019s say the number of people with green eyes is G. Since there are 40 more people with blue eyes than green eyes, the number of people with blue eyes would be G + 40.\n\nNow, the total number of people in the room is 100, which is the sum of people with blue eyes and people with green eyes. So, we can write the equation:\n\nG (green-eyed people) + (G + 40) (blue-eyed people) = 100\n\nSimplifying that, we get:\n\n2G + 40 = 100\n\nNext, we'll subtract 40 from both sides to isolate the terms with G:\n\n2G = 60\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2 to solve for G:\n\nG = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 people with green eyes.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If there are 30 people with green eyes, then the number of people with blue eyes would be 30 + 40 = 70. Adding those together, 30 + 70 equals 100, which matches the total number of people in the room. So, our answer seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the difference in the number of people with blue and green eyes. The difference is 40, and the total is 100. In such problems, we can use the concept of averaging or partitioning the total based on the difference.\n\nFor example, if we let the number of green-eyed people be G, and blue-eyed people be G + 40, then as before, G + (G + 40) = 100, which simplifies to 2G + 40 = 100, and solving for G gives us G = 30.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of the total as being divided into two parts: green-eyed people and blue-eyed people, with blue-eyed people having 40 more than green-eyed people.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that we remove the 40 extra blue-eyed people. Then, the number of blue-eyed people would be equal to the number of green-eyed people. So, the total number of people would be 100 - 40 = 60, and this 60 would be equally divided between blue and green-eyed people.\n\nSo, 60 divided by 2 is 30. Therefore, the number of green-eyed people is 30, and the number of blue-eyed people is 30 + 40 = 70, which again confirms our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, we could use algebraic methods or even consider it as a system of equations, but given the straightforward nature of the problem, the initial approach suffices.\n\nIt's also worth noting that problems like these are common in basic algebra and are designed to help develop problem-solving skills by translating verbal information into mathematical equations.\n\nIn summary, there are 30 people with green eyes in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
