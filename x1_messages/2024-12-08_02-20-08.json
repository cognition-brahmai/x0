        "content": "So, there's this problem here: if you have a group of people standing in a circle and everyone shakes hands with every other person exactly once, how many handshakes will there be if there are 15 people? It seems like a classic handshake problem, but let's break it down step by step to make sure I understand it fully.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the scenario. There are 15 people standing in a circle, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, person A shakes hands with person B, person C, person D, and so on, up to person O (since there are 15 people). But I have to be careful not to double-count handshakes, because when person A shakes hands with person B, that's the same as person B shaking hands with person A.\n\nSo, this sounds like a combination problem, where I'm choosing 2 people out of 15 to shake hands. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 15 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), since we're choosing pairs of people to shake hands.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15!}{2!(15 - 2)!} = \\frac{15!}{2! \\times 13!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can simplify this. The factorial of 15 is \\( 15 \\times 14 \\times 13! \\), so:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13!}{2! \\times 13!}\n\\]\n\nThe \\( 13! \\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 2) = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2!} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nSo, there should be 105 handshakes.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this reasoning. Maybe there's another way to approach it. For example, each person shakes hands with 14 other people, since there are 15 people in total and you don't shake hands with yourself. So, that would be \\( 15 \\times 14 = 210 \\) handshakes. But again, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so I need to divide by 2 to correct for that.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total handshakes} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. So, it seems like 105 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor to consider here. The problem mentions that they are standing in a circle, but does the arrangement matter in this case? In a handshake problem, typically, the arrangement doesn't matter as long as every pair shakes hands exactly once. So, whether they are in a circle, a line, or any other shape, the number of unique pairs should remain the same.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, maybe there's something about the circular arrangement that could affect the count. For example, perhaps there's a restriction on crossing arms or something like that, but the problem doesn't mention any such constraints. It simply says everyone shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the number of handshakes is 105.\n\nWait a minute, let's think about a smaller number to verify. Suppose there are 3 people in the circle: A, B, and C. Each shakes hands with the other two:\n\n- A shakes hands with B and C\n\n- B shakes hands with A and C\n\n- C shakes hands with A and B\n\nBut again, each handshake is counted twice in this approach, so the total unique handshakes are 3.\n\nUsing the combination formula: \\( C(3, 2) = \\frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \\frac{6}{2 \\times 1} = 3 \\), which matches.\n\nAnother example: 4 people - A, B, C, D.\n\nEach shakes hands with the other three:\n\n- A: B, C, D\n\n- B: A, C, D\n\n- C: A, B, D\n\n- D: A, B, C\n\nAgain, this counts each handshake twice, so total unique handshakes are \\( \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6 \\).\n\nUsing the combination formula: \\( C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6 \\), which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for smaller numbers, and therefore should be applicable for 15 people.\n\nJust to explore further, is there a general formula for the number of handshakes in such a scenario? Yes, as we've seen, it's the combination formula \\( C(n, 2) \\), which is equal to \\( \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\).\n\nPlugging in \\( n = 15 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15 \\times 14}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the sum of the first \\( n - 1 \\) integers. For example, with 15 people, the first person shakes hands with 14 others, the second with 13 (since they've already shaken hands with the first), and so on, down to the last person who has no new handshakes left.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n\\[\n14 + 13 + 12 + \\ldots + 1\n\\]\n\nThis is the sum of the first 14 positive integers, which is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, in this case, it's the sum from 1 to 14, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{14 \\times 15}{2} = 105\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same answer. It's reassuring that multiple approaches lead to the same result.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of overlapping handshakes or some other complication, but given the problem's straightforward statement, I don't think so.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 105 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
