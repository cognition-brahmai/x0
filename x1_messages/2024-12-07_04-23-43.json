        "content": "So, the question is: if a person reads 5 pages of a book every day, how many books can they read in a year if each book has 200 pages? And I need to show my work.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many pages the person reads in a year. Since they read 5 pages every day, and there are 365 days in a year, I can multiply 5 pages by 365 days to get the total pages read in a year.\n\nSo, 5 pages/day \u00d7 365 days/year = 1,825 pages/year.\n\nNow, each book has 200 pages. To find out how many books they can read in a year, I need to divide the total pages they read in a year by the number of pages in each book.\n\nSo, 1,825 pages \u00f7 200 pages/book = 9.125 books.\n\nBut you can't really read a fraction of a book, can you? Well, in reality, maybe you can, but since the question is about whole books, I might need to round this number.\n\nIf we consider that they can only finish whole books, then they can read 9 complete books in a year, with some pages left over for starting the 10th book.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that starting a book counts, even if they don't finish it, then it's 9 books plus a portion of the 10th book.\n\nBut the question seems to be about how many books they can read, which probably means complete books. So, I'll go with 9 books.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I should consider leap years. In a leap year, there are 366 days instead of 365. Should I account for that?\n\nWell, the question doesn't specify, so maybe I should consider both scenarios.\n\nFirst, for a non-leap year:\n\n5 pages/day \u00d7 365 days = 1,825 pages.\n\n1,825 pages \u00f7 200 pages/book = 9.125 books.\n\nSo, 9 complete books.\n\nFor a leap year:\n\n5 pages/day \u00d7 366 days = 1,830 pages.\n\n1,830 pages \u00f7 200 pages/book = 9.15 books.\n\nStill, only 9 complete books.\n\nWait, but 1,830 divided by 200 is 9.15, which is still 9 complete books.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some years, reading 5 pages a day would allow for an extra book.\n\nLet me check my math.\n\nFirst, 5 pages per day:\n\nIn 365 days: 5 \u00d7 365 = 1,825 pages.\n\n1,825 \u00f7 200 = 9.125.\n\nIn 366 days: 5 \u00d7 366 = 1,830 pages.\n\n1,830 \u00f7 200 = 9.15.\n\nSo, in both cases, it's still 9 books, with some pages left over.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that 0.125 or 0.15 of a book is equivalent to some pages, and see if that counts as starting another book.\n\nBut typically, when we talk about reading books, it's about completing them.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 9 books in a year.\n\nBut let's double-check the division.\n\n200 pages per book.\n\n1,825 \u00f7 200:\n\n200 \u00d7 9 = 1,800.\n\n1,825 - 1,800 = 25 pages left.\n\nSo, 9 books plus 25 pages into the 10th book.\n\nSimilarly, 1,830 - 1,800 = 30 pages left.\n\nStill, only 9 complete books.\n\nTherefore, the person can read 9 books in a year.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that in some years, like leap years, they might read an extra page, making it possible to read an additional book.\n\nWait, but in leap years, with 366 days, they read 5 \u00d7 366 = 1,830 pages.\n\n1,830 \u00f7 200 = 9.15.\n\nStill, only 9 complete books.\n\nUnless they read more pages per day or change the number of pages per book.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that they read every day except for certain days, like holidays or something.\n\nBut the question says \"every day,\" so probably it's 365 or 366 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they read different numbers of pages on different days, but the question specifies 5 pages every day.\n\nSo, I think 9 books is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I can consider the number of days in a year more carefully.\n\nA non-leap year has 365 days.\n\nA leap year has 366 days.\n\nEvery 4 years, there is a leap year.\n\nSo, on average, the number of days in a year is 365.25 days.\n\nTherefore, on average, pages read per year would be 5 \u00d7 365.25 = 1,826.25 pages.\n\nThen, 1,826.25 \u00f7 200 = 9.13125 books.\n\nStill, only 9 complete books.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps over 4 years, they would read:\n\nIn 3 non-leap years: 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 365 = 5,475 pages.\n\nIn 1 leap year: 5 \u00d7 366 = 1,830 pages.\n\nTotal over 4 years: 5,475 + 1,830 = 7,305 pages.\n\nTotal books: 7,305 \u00f7 200 = 36.525 books.\n\nSo, 36 complete books in 4 years, averaging 9.0 books per year.\n\nStill, 9 books per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the person reads 5 pages per day, but perhaps sometimes they read more than one book at a time.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest reading one book at a time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they read multiple books simultaneously, but again, the question seems to indicate reading one book at a time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the books are of different lengths, but the question specifies each book has 200 pages.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 9 books per year.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the number of books read per day and scale it up to a year.\n\nPages per day: 5.\n\nPages per book: 200.\n\nBooks per day: 5/200 = 0.025 books/day.\n\nThen, in 365 days: 0.025 \u00d7 365 = 9.125 books.\n\nAgain, 9 complete books.\n\nAlternatively, in 366 days: 0.025 \u00d7 366 = 9.15 books.\n\nStill, 9 complete books.\n\nTherefore, the person can read 9 books in a year.\n\nSo, the final answer is 9 books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
