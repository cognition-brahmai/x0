The comparison test states that if 0 \u2264 a_n \u2264 b_n for all n and \u2211b_n diverges, then \u2211a_n also diverges.\n\nLet's consider the harmonic series:\n\nS = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 + ...\n\nWe can group the terms as follows:\n\nGroup 1: 1\n\nGroup 2: 1/2\n\nGroup 3: 1/3 + 1/4\n\nGroup 4: 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8\n\n...\n\nIn general, group k consists of 2^{k-1} terms.\n\nNow, let's look at the sum of each group:\n\nGroup 1: 1 \u2265 1\n\nGroup 2: 1/2 \u2265 1/2\n\nGroup 3: 1/3 + 1/4 \u2265 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2\n\nGroup 4: 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 \u2265 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/2\n\n...\n\nIn general, the sum of group k is greater than or equal to 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the harmonic series S is greater than or equal to the series:\n\n1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + ...\n\nThis series is a divergent series because it is a constant times the harmonic series.\n\nTherefore, by the comparison test, the harmonic series diverges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The harmonic series diverges.}} \\]"
