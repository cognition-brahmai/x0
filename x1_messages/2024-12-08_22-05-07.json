        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a rectangular room that's 12 feet long and 8 feet wide, and I need to cover the entire floor with square tiles that are 2 feet on each side. I need to figure out how many tiles I'll need.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the area of the room and the area of one tile, and then see how many tiles fit into the room's area. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the area of the room is length times width, right? So, that would be 12 feet times 8 feet, which is 96 square feet.\n\nNow, each tile is 2 feet on each side, so the area of one tile is 2 feet times 2 feet, which is 4 square feet.\n\nTo find out how many tiles I need, I can divide the total area of the room by the area of one tile. So, 96 square feet divided by 4 square feet per tile should give me the number of tiles needed.\n\nLet me do the math: 96 divided by 4 is 24. So, I need 24 tiles.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to look at this. Since the tiles are square and the room is rectangular, maybe I can think about how many tiles fit along the length and how many fit along the width, and then multiply those numbers together.\n\nThe length of the room is 12 feet, and each tile is 2 feet long, so 12 divided by 2 is 6 tiles along the length.\n\nThe width of the room is 8 feet, and each tile is 2 feet wide, so 8 divided by 2 is 4 tiles along the width.\n\nThen, the total number of tiles would be 6 times 4, which is also 24 tiles.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It looks like I need 24 tiles to cover the entire floor.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any waste or if the tiles don't fit perfectly. But in this problem, since the tiles and the room dimensions are all in whole numbers and the tiles fit perfectly without any cutting needed, I don't think there's any waste.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Everything is in feet, so that's fine.\n\nSo, my final answer is 24 tiles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
