        "content": "So the library has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 30 books. If the library is at full capacity, how many books are there in total?\n\nAlright, to find the total number of books, I need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold. So, that's 5 shelves times 30 books per shelf.\n\nLet me write that down: Total books = number of shelves \u00d7 books per shelf.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: Total books = 5 \u00d7 30.\n\nNow, 5 times 30 is 150.\n\nSo, the library has 150 books when it's at full capacity.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to think about this? Maybe adding 30 five times: 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30.\n\nLet's see: 30 plus 30 is 60, plus another 30 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 30 is 150.\n\nYeah, that matches the multiplication result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each shelf holds 30 books, and there are 5 shelves, I can also think of it as 5 groups of 30 books.\n\nSo, again, 5 times 30 equals 150.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\nIs there any chance that the shelves aren't all full, or that some books are missing? The question says the library is at full capacity, so I assume all shelves are completely full.\n\nAlso, it doesn't mention any other factors, like different sizes of books or anything like that. So, I can take the numbers at face value.\n\nTherefore, the total number of books in the library is 150.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
