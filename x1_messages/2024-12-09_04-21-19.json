        "content": "Let's see. I start with 10 points, and each turn I lose half of my points. I need to find out after how many turns I'll have less than one point. Okay, so this seems like a problem involving repeated halving. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, I start with 10 points. On the first turn, I lose half of my points, so I'll have 10 - (10/2) = 10 - 5 = 5 points left.\n\nWait, but losing half should mean I retain half, right? Because losing half is the same as keeping half of the points. So, starting with 10, after the first turn, I have 10 * (1/2) = 5 points.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, each turn, I'm multiplying my current points by 1/2.\n\nSo, after turn 1: 10 * (1/2) = 5\n\nAfter turn 2: 5 * (1/2) = 2.5\n\nAfter turn 3: 2.5 * (1/2) = 1.25\n\nAfter turn 4: 1.25 * (1/2) = 0.625\n\nAfter turn 5: 0.625 * (1/2) = 0.3125\n\nSo, after turn 4, I have 0.625 points, which is less than one point.\n\nWait, but the question says \"less than one point.\" After turn 3, I have 1.25, which is still more than one. After turn 4, I have 0.625, which is less than one. So, it seems like after 4 turns, my points are less than one.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nStart: 10 points\n\nTurn 1: 10 * 0.5 = 5 points\n\nTurn 2: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 points\n\nTurn 3: 2.5 * 0.5 = 1.25 points\n\nTurn 4: 1.25 * 0.5 = 0.625 points\n\nYes, after turn 4, I have 0.625 points, which is less than one.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric sequence where each term is half of the previous one.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term is: a_n = a * (r)^(n-1)\n\nWhere a is the initial amount, r is the common ratio (1/2 in this case), and n is the number of turns.\n\nSo, a_n = 10 * (1/2)^(n-1)\n\nI need to find the smallest n such that a_n < 1.\n\nSo, 10 * (1/2)^(n-1) < 1\n\nLet's solve for n.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 10:\n\n(1/2)^(n-1) < 1/10\n\nNow, take the logarithm of both sides. I'll use natural log.\n\nln((1/2)^(n-1)) < ln(1/10)\n\nUsing the property of logarithms: ln(a^b) = b * ln(a)\n\nSo, (n-1) * ln(1/2) < ln(1/10)\n\nNow, ln(1/2) is negative because 1/2 is less than 1. When dividing by a negative number, the inequality sign flips.\n\nSo, n-1 > ln(1/10) / ln(1/2)\n\nCalculate ln(1/10) and ln(1/2).\n\nln(1/10) = ln(1) - ln(10) = 0 - ln(10) = -ln(10)\n\nln(1/2) = ln(1) - ln(2) = 0 - ln(2) = -ln(2)\n\nSo, n-1 > (-ln(10)) / (-ln(2)) = ln(10) / ln(2)\n\nCalculate ln(10) / ln(2). This is the logarithm of 10 base 2.\n\nln(10) \u2248 2.302585\n\nln(2) \u2248 0.693147\n\nSo, ln(10)/ln(2) \u2248 2.302585 / 0.693147 \u2248 3.321928\n\nSo, n-1 > 3.321928\n\nTherefore, n > 4.321928\n\nSince n has to be an integer (number of turns), I need to round up to the next whole number, which is 5.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that after turn 4, I have 0.625, which is less than one. So, it seems like after 4 turns, I already have less than one point.\n\nBut according to the calculation, n > 4.321928, which would suggest that I need 5 turns.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nAfter turn 4: 10 * (1/2)^3 = 10 * (1/8) = 1.25 (wait, no, n-1=3, so n=4)\n\nWait, the formula is a_n = 10 * (1/2)^(n-1)\n\nSo, for n=4: 10 * (1/2)^3 = 10 * 0.125 = 1.25\n\nFor n=5: 10 * (1/2)^4 = 10 * 0.0625 = 0.625\n\nSo, after turn 4, 1.25 > 1\n\nAfter turn 5, 0.625 < 1\n\nSo, it seems like after 5 turns, my points are less than one.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was after 4 turns, but that was using a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused myself.\n\nLet me re-examine the formula.\n\nIf a_n = 10 * (1/2)^(n-1), and I need a_n < 1,\n\nThen, 10 * (1/2)^(n-1) < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 10: (1/2)^(n-1) < 1/10\n\nTake ln: (n-1) * ln(1/2) < ln(1/10)\n\nSince ln(1/2) is negative, flip the inequality: n-1 > ln(1/10)/ln(1/2)\n\nWhich is n-1 > ln(10)/ln(2)\n\nCalculate ln(10)/ln(2) \u2248 3.321928\n\nSo, n-1 > 3.321928 \u2192 n > 4.321928\n\nSince n must be an integer, n = 5\n\nTherefore, after 5 turns, my points will be less than one.\n\nBut earlier, I thought after turn 4, I had 0.625, but that was a mistake.\n\nWait, let's calculate the points after each turn again.\n\nStart: 10 points\n\nTurn 1: 10 * 0.5 = 5 points\n\nTurn 2: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 points\n\nTurn 3: 2.5 * 0.5 = 1.25 points\n\nTurn 4: 1.25 * 0.5 = 0.625 points\n\nTurn 5: 0.625 * 0.5 = 0.3125 points\n\nSo, after turn 4, I have 0.625, which is less than one.\n\nBut according to the formula, n > 4.321928, which suggests n=5.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nLet me check the formula again.\n\nIf a_n = 10 * (1/2)^(n-1), and I need a_n < 1,\n\nThen, 10 * (1/2)^(n-1) < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 10: (1/2)^(n-1) < 1/10\n\nTake logarithm: (n-1) * log(1/2) < log(1/10)\n\nSince log(1/2) is negative, flip the inequality: n-1 > log(1/10)/log(1/2)\n\nWhich is n-1 > log(10)/log(2)\n\nSo, n-1 > log2(10)\n\nlog2(10) is approximately 3.321928\n\nTherefore, n-1 > 3.321928 \u2192 n > 4.321928\n\nSo, n=5\n\nBut according to the step-by-step calculation, after turn 4, I have 0.625, which is less than one.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the points are halved at each turn, starting from turn 1.\n\nLet me list it out:\n\nStart: 10 points (before any turns)\n\nTurn 1: 10 * 0.5 = 5 points\n\nTurn 2: 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 points\n\nTurn 3: 2.5 * 0.5 = 1.25 points\n\nTurn 4: 1.25 * 0.5 = 0.625 points\n\nTurn 5: 0.625 * 0.5 = 0.3125 points\n\nSo, after turn 4, I have 0.625, which is less than one.\n\nBut according to the formula, n > 4.321928, which suggests that it's after turn 5.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be a_n = 10 * (1/2)^n, starting from n=0.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf a_n = 10 * (1/2)^n, with n starting from 0.\n\nThen:\n\nn=0: 10 *1 = 10 points (start)\n\nn=1: 10 * 0.5 = 5 points\n\nn=2: 10 * 0.25 = 2.5 points\n\nn=3: 10 * 0.125 = 1.25 points\n\nn=4: 10 * 0.0625 = 0.625 points\n\nn=5: 10 * 0.03125 = 0.3125 points\n\nSo, after n=4 turns, I have 0.625 points, which is less than one.\n\nTherefore, it seems like after 4 turns, my points are less than one.\n\nBut according to the logarithmic calculation, n > 4.321928, suggesting n=5.\n\nThere's still a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be set up differently.\n\nLet me try solving the inequality again.\n\nWe have a_n = 10 * (1/2)^n < 1\n\nSo, 10 * (1/2)^n < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 10: (1/2)^n < 0.1\n\nTake ln: n * ln(1/2) < ln(0.1)\n\nSince ln(1/2) is negative, flip the inequality: n > ln(0.1)/ln(1/2)\n\nCalculate ln(0.1)/ln(1/2)\n\nln(0.1) \u2248 -2.302585\n\nln(1/2) \u2248 -0.693147\n\nSo, n > (-2.302585)/(-0.693147) \u2248 3.321928\n\nTherefore, n > 3.321928, so n=4\n\nBut earlier calculations show that after n=4 turns, points are 0.625, which is still above 0.5, but less than 1.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, n > 3.321928, which would be n=4.\n\nBut in the step-by-step calculation, after turn 4, points are 0.625, which is less than one.\n\nWait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier.\n\nIf n > 3.321928, then n=4.\n\nAnd indeed, after turn 4, points are 0.625 < 1.\n\nSo, it seems like after 4 turns, my points are less than one.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4 turns.\n\nBut earlier, when I used the formula, it suggested n > 4.321928, which would be n=5.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the formula.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nIf a_n = 10 * (1/2)^n < 1\n\nThen, 10 * (1/2)^n < 1\n\nDivide by 10: (1/2)^n < 0.1\n\nTake ln: n * ln(1/2) < ln(0.1)\n\nDivide by ln(1/2) (negative), flip inequality: n > ln(0.1)/ln(1/2)\n\nCalculate: ln(0.1)/ln(1/2) \u2248 (-2.302585)/(-0.693147) \u2248 3.321928\n\nTherefore, n > 3.321928, so n=4\n\nYes, so n=4 turns are needed for points to be less than one.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step calculation, after turn 4, points are 0.625, which is less than one.\n\nSo, the formula and the step-by-step calculation agree that after 4 turns, points are less than one.\n\nEarlier, I thought the formula suggested n=5, but that was a mistake.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 4 turns.\n\nTherefore, after 4 turns, you will have less than one point.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
