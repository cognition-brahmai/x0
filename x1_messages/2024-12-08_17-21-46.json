        "content": "I'm going to try to prove that every group of order \\( p^2 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number, is abelian. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that a group of order \\( p^2 \\) has \\( p^2 \\) elements, where \\( p \\) is prime. I also recall that groups of prime order are cyclic and therefore abelian, but here the order is \\( p^2 \\), which is a square of a prime.\n\nMaybe I can use the Sylow theorems here. For a group of order \\( p^2 \\), the Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups are the whole group itself since \\( p^2 \\) is the highest power of \\( p \\) dividing the group order.\n\nWait, but Sylow theorems might be a bit overkill for this problem. Perhaps I can look at the center of the group.\n\nI remember that the center of a group, denoted \\( Z(G) \\), is the set of all elements that commute with every element in the group. That is,\n\n\\[ Z(G) = \\{ z \\in G \\mid zg = gz \\text{ for all } g \\in G \\} \\]\n\nIf the center of the group is the whole group, then the group is abelian.\n\nSo, maybe I can show that \\( Z(G) \\) is not trivial and then see what possibilities there are.\n\nFirst, I know that for any group, the center is a normal subgroup. So, \\( Z(G) \\triangleleft G \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group \\( G / Z(G) \\). The order of this quotient group is \\( [G : Z(G)] \\), which is the index of \\( Z(G) \\) in \\( G \\).\n\nSince \\( G \\) has order \\( p^2 \\), the possible orders for \\( Z(G) \\) are the divisors of \\( p^2 \\), which are \\( 1, p, \\) and \\( p^2 \\).\n\nIf \\( Z(G) = G \\), then \\( G \\) is abelian, and we're done.\n\nIf \\( Z(G) \\) is trivial, that is, \\( Z(G) = \\{ e \\} \\), then \\( G / Z(G) \\) would have order \\( p^2 \\), but I think this leads to a contradiction because \\( G / Z(G) \\) would be a group of order \\( p^2 \\), which would imply that \\( Z(G) \\) is not trivial.\n\nWait, actually, if \\( Z(G) \\) is trivial, then \\( G / Z(G) \\) would have order \\( p^2 \\), but I think for non-abelian groups, the center is smaller.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can use the class equation.\n\nThe class equation is:\n\n\\[ |G| = |Z(G)| + \\sum_{i} [G : C_G(g_i)] \\]\n\nwhere the sum is over a set of representatives \\( g_i \\) of the conjugacy classes not in the center, and \\( C_G(g_i) \\) is the centralizer of \\( g_i \\) in \\( G \\).\n\nSince \\( G \\) has order \\( p^2 \\), and \\( p \\) is prime, the sizes of the conjugacy classes must divide the order of the group. But the size of each conjugacy class is \\( [G : C_G(g)] \\), which divides \\( p^2 \\).\n\nNow, for elements in the center, their conjugacy class has only one element, themselves. For elements not in the center, their conjugacy class has size greater than 1, and since it divides \\( p^2 \\), the possible sizes are \\( p \\) or \\( p^2 \\).\n\nBut if the conjugacy class has size \\( p^2 \\), that would mean that the centralizer of the element is trivial, which can't happen because at least the element and the identity commute.\n\nSo, the size of each conjugacy class not in the center must be \\( p \\).\n\nTherefore, the class equation looks like:\n\n\\[ p^2 = |Z(G)| + k \\cdot p \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the number of conjugacy classes not in the center.\n\nNow, since \\( |Z(G)| \\) must be a multiple of \\( p \\) (because the center is a subgroup of a \\( p \\)-group, and subgroups of \\( p \\)-groups have order divisible by \\( p \\)), and \\( k \\) is an integer, we can analyze this equation.\n\nPossible values for \\( |Z(G)| \\) are \\( p \\) or \\( p^2 \\), as \\( |Z(G)| \\) can't be 1 because \\( p \\) divides \\( |Z(G)| \\).\n\nIf \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), then \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nIf \\( |Z(G)| = p \\), then the class equation becomes:\n\n\\[ p^2 = p + k \\cdot p \\]\n\n\\[ p^2 - p = k \\cdot p \\]\n\n\\[ p(p - 1) = k \\cdot p \\]\n\n\\[ k = p - 1 \\]\n\nSo, there are \\( p - 1 \\) conjugacy classes outside the center.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where \\( |Z(G)| = p \\).\n\nIn this case, \\( G / Z(G) \\) is a group of order \\( p \\), since \\( [G : Z(G)] = p \\).\n\nBut a group of order \\( p \\) is cyclic, as \\( p \\) is prime.\n\nLet \\( G / Z(G) = \\langle g Z(G) \\rangle \\) for some \\( g \\in G \\).\n\nThis means that every element of \\( G \\) can be written as \\( g^k z \\) for some integer \\( k \\) and some \\( z \\in Z(G) \\).\n\nNow, take two elements \\( a, b \\in G \\). We can write \\( a = g^k z_1 \\) and \\( b = g^m z_2 \\), where \\( z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G) \\).\n\nNow, let's compute \\( ab \\) and \\( ba \\):\n\n\\[ ab = (g^k z_1)(g^m z_2) = g^k (z_1 g^m) z_2 \\]\n\nSince \\( z_1 \\) is in the center, it commutes with \\( g^m \\):\n\n\\[ ab = g^k (g^m z_1) z_2 = g^{k+m} z_1 z_2 \\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[ ba = (g^m z_2)(g^k z_1) = g^m (z_2 g^k) z_1 = g^m (g^k z_2) z_1 = g^{m+k} z_2 z_1 \\]\n\nSince \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 \\) are in the center, they commute with each other:\n\n\\[ z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ ab = g^{k+m} z_1 z_2 = g^{m+k} z_2 z_1 = ba \\]\n\nSo, \\( ab = ba \\) for all \\( a, b \\in G \\), which means that \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nWait a minute, but I assumed that \\( |Z(G)| = p \\), and arrived at the conclusion that \\( G \\) is abelian, which would imply that \\( Z(G) = G \\), contradicting the assumption that \\( |Z(G)| = p \\).\n\nThis suggests that the assumption \\( |Z(G)| = p \\) leads to a contradiction, meaning that the only possibility is \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), which means \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this.\n\nLet me consider the exponent of the group. I know that in a group of order \\( p^2 \\), the exponent must divide \\( p^2 \\), so the elements have orders dividing \\( p^2 \\).\n\nPossible element orders are 1, \\( p \\), or \\( p^2 \\).\n\nIf there exists an element of order \\( p^2 \\), then the group is cyclic, generated by that element, and hence abelian.\n\nIf not, then all non-identity elements have order \\( p \\).\n\nSo, in this case, the group is a \\( p \\)-group of exponent \\( p \\).\n\nNow, in this situation, perhaps I can consider the derived subgroup, which measures how far the group is from being abelian.\n\nThe derived subgroup \\( G' \\) is generated by all commutators \\( [g, h] = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh \\) for \\( g, h \\in G \\).\n\nIf \\( G' = \\{ e \\} \\), then \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( G \\) is a \\( p \\)-group, its center is non-trivial, as we've already established.\n\nIn fact, for \\( p \\)-groups, the center is non-trivial, and more generally, the lower central series descends to the identity.\n\nBut in our earlier approach, when assuming \\( |Z(G)| = p \\), we concluded that \\( G \\) is abelian, which contradicts the assumption.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), meaning \\( Z(G) = G \\), hence \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the automorphism group of \\( G \\).\n\nBut I think the approach with the center and the class equation is sufficient.\n\nLet me try to summarize this.\n\nWe consider a group \\( G \\) of order \\( p^2 \\), where \\( p \\) is prime.\n\nWe look at the center \\( Z(G) \\), which is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\).\n\nThe possible orders for \\( Z(G) \\) are 1, \\( p \\), or \\( p^2 \\).\n\nBut since \\( G \\) is a \\( p \\)-group, its center cannot be trivial, so \\( |Z(G)| \\) is either \\( p \\) or \\( p^2 \\).\n\nIf \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), then \\( Z(G) = G \\), and \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nIf \\( |Z(G)| = p \\), then \\( G / Z(G) \\) is a group of order \\( p \\), which is cyclic.\n\nLet \\( G / Z(G) = \\langle g Z(G) \\rangle \\) for some \\( g \\in G \\).\n\nThen every element of \\( G \\) can be written as \\( g^k z \\) for some integer \\( k \\) and some \\( z \\in Z(G) \\).\n\nTaking two elements \\( a = g^k z_1 \\) and \\( b = g^m z_2 \\), with \\( z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G) \\), we have:\n\n\\[ ab = g^k z_1 g^m z_2 = g^{k+m} z_1 z_2 \\]\n\n\\[ ba = g^m z_2 g^k z_1 = g^{m+k} z_2 z_1 \\]\n\nSince \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 \\) commute, \\( z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1 \\), so \\( ab = ba \\).\n\nThis implies that \\( G \\) is abelian, which contradicts the assumption that \\( |Z(G)| = p \\) (since in an abelian group, \\( Z(G) = G \\)).\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is \\( |Z(G)| = p^2 \\), meaning \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nHence, every group of order \\( p^2 \\) is abelian.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Every group of order } p^2 \\text{ is abelian.}}"
