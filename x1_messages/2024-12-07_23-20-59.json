        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a box with balls of different colors: 5 red, 7 blue, and 3 green. I need to find out the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball without looking. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball, and the total outcomes are picking any ball from the box.\n\nLet me figure out the total number of balls in the box. There are 5 red, 7 blue, and 3 green balls. So, total balls = 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls plus the number of blue balls, which is 5 + 7 = 12 balls.\n\nSo, the probability of picking either a red or blue ball should be the number of red and blue balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 12/15.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3, which gives me 4/5.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, I can multiply 4/5 by 100, which is 80%. So, there's an 80% chance of picking either a red or blue ball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the probability of not picking a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue.\n\nThe number of green balls is 3, and the total number of balls is 15, so the probability of picking a green ball is 3/15, which simplifies to 1/5 or 20%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green ball (i.e., picking either red or blue) is 1 minus the probability of picking green, which is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5, or 80%.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, I'm confident that 4/5 or 80% is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to look at this. Is there any chance that picking a red or blue ball could be dependent on anything else, like the order of picking or something? No, the problem says it's a random pick without looking, and I'm only picking one ball, so each ball has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I haven't miscounted the balls. 5 red, 7 blue, 3 green, total 15. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of picking either a red or blue ball is 4/5 or 80%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{5}} \\]"
