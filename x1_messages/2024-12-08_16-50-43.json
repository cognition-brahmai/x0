        "content": "So the company currently has 120 employees, and they want to increase their workforce by 15%. To find out how many new employees that corresponds to, I need to calculate 15% of 120.\n\nFirst, I'll convert the percentage to a decimal. 15% is the same as 15 divided by 100, which is 0.15.\n\nNext, I'll multiply the current number of employees by this decimal to find the number of new employees.\n\nSo, 120 multiplied by 0.15.\n\nLet me do the math: 120 times 0.15.\n\n120 times 0.1 is 12, and 120 times 0.05 is 6. So, 12 plus 6 equals 18.\n\nTherefore, the company will hire 18 new employees.\n\nNow, to find the total number of employees after the hiring, I'll add the new employees to the current number.\n\n120 plus 18 equals 138.\n\nSo, after hiring, the company will have 138 employees in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to be sure.\n\nStarting with 120 employees, increasing by 15%.\n\n15% of 120 is indeed 18.\n\nAdding 18 to 120 gives 138.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the company is increasing its workforce by a factor of 1 plus 15%, which is 1.15.\n\nSo, 120 multiplied by 1.15 should also give me the total number of employees after the increase.\n\nLet me calculate that: 120 times 1.15.\n\n120 times 1 is 120, and 120 times 0.15 is 18. Adding those together gives 138, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nGood, it's consistent.\n\nSo, to summarize: the company will hire 18 new employees, and the total number of employees after hiring will be 138.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18 \\text{ new employees, total of } 138 \\text{ employees}} \\]"
