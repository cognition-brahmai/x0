        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says that the rectangle has a length of 12 meters and a width of 8 meters. Then, both the length and the width are increased by 50%, and I need to find out what the new area of the rectangle is after this increase.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, originally, the area is 12 meters times 8 meters, which is 96 square meters. But now, both dimensions are being increased by 50%. So, I need to find out what the new length and width are after this increase, and then multiply them to get the new area.\n\nLet me think about how to increase the length and width by 50%. Increasing a dimension by 50% means adding half of its original value to itself. So, for the length: 12 meters plus half of 12 meters, which is 6 meters, so the new length would be 18 meters. Similarly, for the width: 8 meters plus half of 8 meters, which is 4 meters, so the new width would be 12 meters.\n\nNow, to find the new area, I just multiply the new length by the new width: 18 meters times 12 meters. Let's see, 18 times 12. I can calculate that as 18 times 10 is 180, plus 18 times 2 is 36, so total 216 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to do this? Maybe without calculating the new dimensions separately. I remember that if you increase both length and width by the same percentage, the area increases by the square of that percentage increase. Let's see, a 50% increase in both dimensions would mean the area increases by (1 + 0.5)^2 times the original area.\n\nSo, (1 + 0.5)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25. So, the new area should be 2.25 times the original area. The original area is 96 square meters, so 2.25 times 96 should give me the new area.\n\nLet me calculate that: 2.25 times 96. Well, 2 times 96 is 192, and 0.25 times 96 is 24, so added together, that's 216 square meters. Okay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the new area of the rectangle after increasing both the length and width by 50% is 216 square meters.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think about it another way. If I increase the length by 50% and the width by 50%, that's like scaling both dimensions by a factor of 1.5. Since area is a two-dimensional measurement, the scaling factors multiply, so the area is scaled by 1.5 times 1.5, which is 2.25, just like before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the percentage increase in area. If the original area is 96 square meters, and the new area is 216 square meters, then the increase in area is 216 - 96 = 120 square meters. So, the area has increased by 120 square meters, which is more than the original area. That makes sense because both dimensions are increased by 50%, leading to a more than doubling of the area.\n\nWait, actually, 50% increase in both dimensions should lead to a 1.5 times increase in each dimension, and since area is two-dimensional, it should be 1.5 squared, which is 2.25 times the original area, as I calculated. So, from 96 square meters to 216 square meters is indeed a 120 square meter increase, which is 2.25 times the original area.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer in multiple ways, so I'm confident that 216 square meters is the correct new area of the rectangle after both the length and width are increased by 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{216} \\]"
