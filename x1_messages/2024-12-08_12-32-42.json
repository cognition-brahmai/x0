It's this massive sculpture in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and it features the faces of four really important U.S. presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Each of their faces is huge, like way bigger than life-sized, and they're carved right into the mountain. It's pretty impressive to see in person. The idea was to create a monument that would attract tourists to the region, and it definitely does that. So, yeah, Mount Rushmore is the iconic American landmark you're thinking of."
