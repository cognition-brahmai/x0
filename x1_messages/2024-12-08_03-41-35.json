Chan Kim and Ren\u00e9e Mauborgne in their book \"Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant,\" published in 2005.\n\nThe metaphor of 'blue oceans' represents untapped markets or new market spaces where competition is non-existent or minimal, allowing companies to create and capture new demand. In contrast, 'red oceans' represent known markets where competition is intense and the waters are bloody with fighting companies.\n\nThe Blue Ocean Strategy encourages businesses to break away from the traditional focus on competing within existing industries (red oceans) and instead create new markets where they can dominate without direct competition. This is achieved by offering innovative products or services that create value for customers in ways that were previously unexplored.\n\nKey principles of the Blue Ocean Strategy include:\n\n1. **Value Innovation:** Combining differentiation and low cost to create a new market space.\n\n2. **Focus on Buyers' Needs:** Understanding and addressing unmet customer needs to open up new markets.\n\n3. **\u8de8\u8d8a\u884c\u4e1a\u8fb9\u754c:** Looking beyond existing industries to find new opportunities.\n\n4. **Following the Rational and Emotion:** Creating products or services that appeal to both the rational and emotional needs of customers.\n\n5. **Going Beyond Existing Demand:** Instead of competing for existing customers, create new demand by attracting non-customers or those who didn't think they needed the product.\n\n6. **The Four Actions Framework:** This framework helps businesses determine how to make industry-wide compromises obsolete by reducing, raising, creating, and eliminating certain factors in their products or services.\n\nBy employing these strategies, companies can create 'blue oceans' where they can thrive without the intense competition found in 'red oceans.' This approach not only leads to higher profits but also to sustainable growth as companies continuously innovate and create new markets.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nKim, W. C., & Mauborgne, R. (2005).
