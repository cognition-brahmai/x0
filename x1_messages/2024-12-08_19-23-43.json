        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to write a Java program that takes a string as input and finds the longest palindrome substring within that string. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, right? Like \"racecar\" or \"level\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a palindrome is and how to check if a substring is a palindrome. A straightforward way is to compare characters symmetrically from the center outwards. But since the palindrome can be of odd or even length, I need to consider both cases.\n\nI recall that one common approach is to expand around the center. For each possible center of the palindrome, I can expand outwards as long as the characters on both sides match. I need to do this for every potential center to cover all possible palindromes.\n\nBut this approach might be inefficient for very long strings because it has a time complexity of O(n^2). However, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the input size, I'll proceed with this approach for now.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to implement:\n\n1. Initialize variables to keep track of the start and end indices of the longest palindrome found.\n\n2. Iterate through each character in the string, considering it as the center of a potential palindrome.\n\n3. For each center, expand outwards as long as the characters on both sides match and the indices are within bounds.\n\n4. Keep track of the longest palindrome found during these expansions.\n\n5. After checking all possible centers, extract and print the longest palindrome substring.\n\nI also need to consider that palindromes can be of odd or even length. For odd-length palindromes, the center is a single character, and for even-length palindromes, the center is between two characters.\n\nTo handle both cases, I can modify the expansion step to consider both odd and even length palindromes.\n\nLet me sketch a rough algorithm:\n\n- Initialize start and end indices to 0.\n\n- Iterate through each character in the string:\n\n- For odd-length palindromes:\n\n- Expand around the center i.\n\n- Update start and end if a longer palindrome is found.\n\n- For even-length palindromes:\n\n- Expand around the center between i and i+1.\n\n- Update start and end if a longer palindrome is found.\n\n- After iterating through all characters, extract the substring from start to end+1 and print it.\n\nI need to write helper functions to handle the expansion. Let's call them expandAroundCenter for odd and even length palindromes.\n\nIn the expandAroundCenter function, I'll take the left and right indices and expand outwards as long as s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right) and left >= 0 and right < s.length().\n\nOnce I have the lengths of the palindromes found, I'll compare them to the current maximum length and update the start and end indices if a longer palindrome is found.\n\nI should also handle edge cases, such as when the input string is empty or has only one character. In such cases, the entire string is a palindrome.\n\nLet me consider some examples to verify my approach.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: \"babad\"\n\nPossible palindromes: \"bab\", \"aba\", \"d\"\n\nLongest: \"bab\" or \"aba\" (both are of length 3)\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: \"cbbd\"\n\nPossible palindromes: \"bb\"\n\nLongest: \"bb\" (length 2)\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: \"a\"\n\nLongest palindrome: \"a\" (length 1)\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: \"ac\"\n\nPossible palindromes: \"a\", \"c\"\n\nLongest: \"a\" or \"c\" (both length 1)\n\nSeems straightforward. Now, I need to implement this in Java.\n\nI should also think about the time and space complexity. As mentioned earlier, the time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, which should be acceptable for most practical purposes. The space complexity is O(1), as I'm only using a few variables to store indices and temporary lengths.\n\nI need to make sure that my code is efficient and doesn't have any unnecessary computations.\n\nLet me start by writing the main function that takes a string as input and calls the helper functions to find the longest palindrome.\n\nI'll define a function called longestPalindrome that takes a string s and returns the longest palindrome substring.\n\nInside longestPalindrome, I'll initialize variables:\n\n- int start = 0;\n\n- int end = 0;\n\nThen, I'll iterate through each character:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n// Find the length of the palindrome with center at i (odd length)\n\nint len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);\n\n// Find the length of the palindrome with center between i and i+1 (even length)\n\nint len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i+1);\n\n// Update the maximum length and indices\n\nint maxLen = Math.max(len1, len2);\n\nif (maxLen > end - start) {\n\nstart = i - (maxLen - 1)/2;\n\nend = i + maxLen/2;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nFinally, return the substring from start to end+1.\n\nWait, I need to make sure that the indices are correctly calculated for both odd and even length palindromes.\n\nLet me think about it again.\n\nFor odd length:\n\n- Center is at index i.\n\n- The palindrome extends from i - len/2 to i + len/2.\n\nFor even length:\n\n- Center is between i and i+1.\n\n- The palindrome extends from i - (len-1)/2 to i + len/2.\n\nWait, I need a unified way to calculate start and end indices.\n\nLet me adjust the calculation:\n\n- For both cases, the length is len1 or len2.\n\n- The start index would be i - (len - 1)/2;\n\n- The end index would be i + len/2;\n\nThis should work for both odd and even lengths.\n\nLet me test this with an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\ns = \"babad\"\n\nLet's say at i=1 ('a'), len1=3 (index 1,2,3 -> \"aba\"), len2=0.\n\nSo, maxLen=3.\n\nstart = 1 - (3-1)/2 = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nend = 1 + 3/2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, substring from 0 to 3 is \"bab\"\n\nSimilarly, at i=2 ('b'), len1=3 (\"rib\"), len2=0.\n\nstart = 2 - (3-1)/2 = 2 - 1 =1\n\nend = 2 + 3/2=2+1=3 -> \"aba\"\n\nBoth are correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\ns = \"cbbd\"\n\nAt i=1 ('b'), len1=1 (just 'b'), len2=2 ('bb')\n\nmaxLen=2\n\nstart=1 - (2-1)/2=1-0=1\n\nend=1 + 2/2=1+1=2 -> \"bb\"\n\nCorrect.\n\nSeems good.\n\nNow, implement the expandAroundCenter function.\n\npublic int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {\n\nwhile (left >=0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {\n\nleft--;\n\nright++;\n\n}\n\n// The length of the palindrome is right - left -1\n\nreturn right - left -1;\n\n}\n\nWait, in this function, when the while loop exits, left and right have been incremented/decremented one step too far.\n\nSo, the actual palindrome length is right - left -1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me verify with the example s=\"babad\", i=1.\n\nexpandAroundCenter(s,1,1):\n\nleft=1, right=1\n\ns.charAt(1)=='a' == s.charAt(1)=='a' -> true\n\nleft=0, right=2\n\ns.charAt(0)=='b' == s.charAt(2)=='b' -> true\n\nleft=-1, right=3\n\nNow, left <0, so length=3-(-1)-1=3\n\nCorrect.\n\nSimilarly, expandAroundCenter(s,1,2):\n\nleft=1, right=2\n\ns.charAt(1)=='a' == s.charAt(2)=='b' -> false\n\nSo, length=2-1-1=0\n\nWait, but according to the earlier logic, len2=0.\n\nBut in the string \"cbbd\", at i=1, len2 should be 2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ns=\"cbbd\"\n\ni=1 ('b'), i+1=2 ('b')\n\nexpandAroundCenter(s,1,2):\n\nleft=1, right=2\n\ns.charAt(1)=='b' == s.charAt(2)=='b' -> true\n\nleft=0, right=3\n\ns.charAt(0)=='c' == s.charAt(3)=='d' -> false\n\nSo, length=3-0-1=2\n\nCorrect.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to handle the case when the string is empty or has only one character.\n\nIf s.length() ==0, return empty string.\n\nIf s.length() ==1, return s itself.\n\nI should add checks at the beginning of the function.\n\nAlso, need to ensure that the indices don't go out of bounds.\n\nI think the expandAroundCenter function already handles that.\n\nLet me write the complete function now.\n\npublic String longestPalindrome(String s) {\n\nif (s == null || s.length() <1) return \"\";\n\nint start=0, end=0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {\n\nint len1 = expandAroundCenter(s,i,i);\n\nint len2 = expandAroundCenter(s,i,i+1);\n\nint maxLen = Math.max(len1, len2);\n\nif (maxLen > end - start) {\n\nstart = i - (maxLen-1)/2;\n\nend = i + maxLen/2;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn s.substring(start, end+1);\n\n}\n\nWait, substring in Java is from start to end exclusive, so s.substring(start, end+1) will include end index.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nLet me test this function with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\ns=\"babad\"\n\nlongestPalindrome(s) should return \"bab\" or \"aba\"\n\nEither is correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\ns=\"cbbd\"\n\nlongestPalindrome(s) should return \"bb\"\n\nExample 3:\n\ns=\"a\"\n\nshould return \"a\"\n\nExample 4:\n\ns=\"ac\"\n\nshould return \"a\" or \"c\"\n\nBoth are correct.\n\nSeems good.\n\nNow, I need to write the expandAroundCenter function.\n\npublic int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {\n\nwhile (left >=0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {\n\nleft--;\n\nright++;\n\n}\n\nreturn right - left -1;\n\n}\n\nThis should work.\n\nI think this covers the basic functionality.\n\nBut I should consider if there are any edge cases that might break this logic.\n\nEdge case 1:\n\ns=\"\"\n\nShould return \"\"\n\nEdge case 2:\n\ns=\"a\"\n\nShould return \"a\"\n\nEdge case 3:\n\ns=\"ab\"\n\nShould return \"a\" or \"b\"\n\nEdge case 4:\n\ns=\"aa\"\n\nShould return \"aa\"\n\nEdge case 5:\n\ns=\"abcba\"\n\nShould return \"abcba\"\n\nEdge case 6:\n\ns=\"abcbaz\"\n\nShould return \"abcba\"\n\nWait, \"abcbaz\" has \"abcba\" as the longest palindrome.\n\nYes, my function should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case:\n\ns=\"abcdcba\"\n\nShould return \"abcdcba\"\n\nYes.\n\nI think this covers most of the cases.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Java.\n\nI should also think about the time complexity.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the time complexity is O(n^2) because for each character, we might expand up to O(n) times.\n\nSpace complexity is O(1), which is good.\n\nIs there a way to optimize this further?\n\nManacher's algorithm can find the longest palindromic substring in O(n) time, but it's more complex to implement.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify any constraints on time or space, and O(n^2) should be acceptable for most practical purposes, I'll stick with this approach for now.\n\nIf needed, I can look into implementing Manacher's algorithm for better performance, but it might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlright, I think I have a solid plan to implement the required Java program.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest palindrome substring in a given string. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. We will use an approach that expands around the center of potential palindromes, considering both odd and even length palindromes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Expand Around Center**: We define a helper function `expandAroundCenter` that takes a left and right index and expands outwards as long as the characters at these indices match and the indices are within bounds.\n2. **Iterate Through Centers**: We iterate through each character in the string, considering each character as the center of a potential palindrome (for odd-length palindromes) and between each pair of characters (for even-length palindromes).\n3. **Track Longest Palindrome**: We keep track of the start and end indices of the longest palindrome found during these expansions.\n4. **Return Substring**: Finally, we extract and return the substring from the start to end indices.\n\n### Solution Code\n```java\npublic class LongestPalindrome {\n\n    public static String longestPalindrome(String s) {\n        if (s == null || s.length() < 1) return \"\";\n        \n        int start = 0, end = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n            int len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i); // Odd length palindrome\n            int len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1); // Even length palindrome\n            int maxLen = Math.max(len1, len2);\n            if (maxLen > end - start) {\n                start = i - (maxLen - 1) / 2;\n                end = i + maxLen / 2;\n            }\n        }\n        return s.substring(start, end + 1);\n    }\n    \n    private static int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {\n        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {\n            left--;\n            right++;\n        }\n        return right - left - 1;\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Test the function\n        String input = \"babad\";\n        System.out.println(\"Longest palindrome substring: \" + longestPalindrome(input));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Helper Function**: `expandAroundCenter` takes a left and right index, expands outwards as long as the characters match, and returns the length of the palindrome found.\n2. **Main Function**: `longestPalindrome` iterates through each character in the string, finds the lengths of both odd and even length palindromes centered at each character, and keeps track of the longest one found.\n3. **Efficiency**: The approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the expansion around each center and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for most practical purposes.\n\nThis solution effectively finds the longest palindrome substring in the given string by considering all possible centers and expanding around them to check for palindromes."
