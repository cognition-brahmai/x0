        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 people in the room, and each person has 2 hats and 3 pairs of shoes. So, first, I need to figure out how many hats and shoes are there in total initially.\n\nFor hats: 4 people \u00d7 2 hats/person = 8 hats.\n\nFor shoes: 4 people \u00d7 3 pairs/person = 12 pairs of shoes.\n\nSo, altogether, there are 8 hats and 12 pairs of shoes in the room at the start.\n\nNow, one person leaves the room with all their belongings. That means this person takes their 2 hats and 3 pairs of shoes with them.\n\nSo, we need to subtract those from the total.\n\nHats remaining: 8 - 2 = 6 hats.\n\nShoes remaining: 12 - 3 = 9 pairs of shoes.\n\nTherefore, after one person leaves with their belongings, there are 6 hats and 9 pairs of shoes left in the room.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, after one person leaves, there are 3 people left in the room. Each still has their 2 hats and 3 pairs of shoes.\n\nSo, hats: 3 people \u00d7 2 hats/person = 6 hats.\n\nShoes: 3 people \u00d7 3 pairs/person = 9 pairs of shoes.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by subtracting the departed person's belongings.\n\nSo, yes, 6 hats and 9 pairs of shoes remain in the room.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor to consider. Is there any possibility that the person who left didn't take all their belongings, or that there were shared hats or shoes? The problem says that one person leaves with all their belongings, so I think it's safe to assume that they took everything that was theirs.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 6 hats and 9 pairs of shoes remaining in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ hats and } 9 \\text{ pairs of shoes}} \\]\n"
