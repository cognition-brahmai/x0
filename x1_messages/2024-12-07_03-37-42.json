        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a school with 1,000 students. According to the problem:\n\n- 60% play soccer\n\n- 30% play basketball\n\n- 15% play both sports\n\nWe need to find out how many students do not play either sport.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out how many students play each sport.\n\nSo, for soccer:\n\n60% of 1,000 students = 0.60 * 1,000 = 600 students\n\nFor basketball:\n\n30% of 1,000 students = 0.30 * 1,000 = 300 students\n\nNow, 15% play both sports:\n\n15% of 1,000 students = 0.15 * 1,000 = 150 students\n\nTo find out how many students play either soccer or basketball, I need to add the number of students who play soccer and the number who play basketball, but then subtract those who play both because they are counted in both groups.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nNumber playing soccer or basketball = (soccer) + (basketball) - (both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n600 + 300 - 150 = 750 students\n\nSo, 750 students play either soccer or basketball.\n\nNow, to find out how many students do not play either sport, I subtract the number who play either sport from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students - students playing soccer or basketball = students playing neither\n\n1,000 - 750 = 250 students\n\nTherefore, 250 students do not play either sport.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nSoccer: 60% of 1,000 = 600\n\nBasketball: 30% of 1,000 = 300\n\nBoth: 15% of 1,000 = 150\n\nSoccer or basketball: 600 + 300 - 150 = 750\n\nNeither: 1,000 - 750 = 250\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it using sets.\n\nLet S be the set of students playing soccer, and B be the set of students playing basketball.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- |S| = 600\n\n- |B| = 300\n\n- |S \u2229 B| = 150\n\nWe need to find the number of students who do not play either sport, which is the complement of the union of S and B.\n\nSo, number of students not playing either sport = total students - |S \u222a B|\n\nAnd |S \u222a B| = |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B| = 600 + 300 - 150 = 750\n\nTherefore, 1,000 - 750 = 250 students\n\nAlternatively, we can use percentages to verify.\n\nTotal percentage playing soccer or basketball = percentage playing soccer + percentage playing basketball - percentage playing both\n\nWhich is 60% + 30% - 15% = 75%\n\nSo, 75% of students play either soccer or basketball.\n\nTherefore, the percentage not playing either sport is 100% - 75% = 25%\n\nNow, 25% of 1,000 students = 0.25 * 1,000 = 250 students\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think 250 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
