        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1200 widgets every day, and each widget weighs 1.5 pounds. I need to find out the total weight of all the widgets produced in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many widgets are produced in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, I can multiply the daily production by 7.\n\nSo, 1200 widgets/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 8400 widgets/week.\n\nNow, each widget weighs 1.5 pounds, so to find the total weight, I need to multiply the number of widgets by the weight per widget.\n\nThat would be 8400 widgets \u00d7 1.5 pounds/widget.\n\nLet me do the math: 8400 \u00d7 1.5.\n\nWell, 8400 \u00d7 1 is 8400, and 8400 \u00d7 0.5 is 4200, so adding them together is 8400 + 4200 = 12600 pounds.\n\nSo, all the widgets produced in a week weigh 12,600 pounds.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by calculating the daily weight first and then multiplying by 7.\n\nLet's try that. Daily weight of widgets is 1200 widgets \u00d7 1.5 pounds/widget = 1800 pounds/day.\n\nThen, for a week, 1800 pounds/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 12,600 pounds/week.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, 12,600 pounds is the total weight of widgets produced in a week.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this. For example, is the factory open every day of the week? Does the production rate change on weekends?\n\nWell, the problem says the factory produces 1200 widgets every day, so I think it's safe to assume that it's a constant daily production rate and the factory operates every day of the week.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that the units are consistent. Here, the weight is in pounds, and the time is in days and weeks, but since I converted everything correctly, it should be fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the weight includes any packaging or additional materials, but the problem simply states that each widget weighs 1.5 pounds, so I think it's just the weight of the widgets themselves.\n\nSo, my final answer is 12,600 pounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12600 \\text{ pounds}} \\]"
