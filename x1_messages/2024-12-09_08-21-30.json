        "content": "So the farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters by 500 meters, and he wants to plant corn everywhere except for a 10-meter-wide border around the entire field. That border needs to stay unplanted for access purposes. I need to figure out the area where he can actually plant corn.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the field. It's a rectangle, 300 meters in one direction and 500 meters in the other. If he's leaving a 10-meter-wide border around the entire field, that means on all sides\u2014top, bottom, left, and right\u2014there's a 10-meter strip that won't be planted.\n\nSo, to find the area where he can plant corn, I need to subtract the border from the total area of the field.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total area of the field. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so:\n\nTotal area = 300 meters * 500 meters = 150,000 square meters.\n\nNow, the border is 10 meters wide all around. That means that the planting area is going to be smaller than the total field area.\n\nTo find the dimensions of the planting area, I need to subtract the border from each side.\n\nSince the border is on both sides of each dimension, I need to subtract twice the border width from each dimension.\n\nSo, for the width:\n\nPlanting width = total width - 2 * border width = 300 meters - 2 * 10 meters = 300 meters - 20 meters = 280 meters.\n\nSimilarly, for the length:\n\nPlanting length = total length - 2 * border width = 500 meters - 2 * 10 meters = 500 meters - 20 meters = 480 meters.\n\nNow, the area where he can plant corn is the planting width times the planting length:\n\nPlanting area = 280 meters * 480 meters.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n280 * 480.\n\nI can break this down:\n\n280 * 500 would be 140,000, but since it's 480, which is 20 less than 500, I need to subtract 20 * 280 from 140,000.\n\n20 * 280 = 5,600.\n\nSo, planting area = 140,000 - 5,600 = 134,400 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal area: 300 * 500 = 150,000 square meters.\n\nBorder area: total area - planting area = 150,000 - 134,400 = 15,600 square meters.\n\nDoes that sound right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the border area directly and then subtract it from the total area to find the planting area.\n\nThe border consists of two parts: the perimeter strip that's 10 meters wide.\n\nBut actually, the border is just the area around the field, 10 meters wide on all sides.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the border as consisting of four rectangles: two lengths and two widths.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the border forms a frame around the field.\n\nSo, the area of the border can be calculated as the total area minus the planting area.\n\nBut I already did that, and I got 15,600 square meters for the border area.\n\nBut maybe I should verify if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the area of the border by considering it as the difference between the outer rectangle and the inner rectangle where the corn is planted.\n\nSo, the outer rectangle is 300m by 500m.\n\nThe inner rectangle is 280m by 480m.\n\nSo, border area = total area - planting area = 150,000 - 134,400 = 15,600 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the border area by adding up the areas of the borders.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe border consists of two strips along the length and two strips along the width.\n\nEach strip along the length is 500m long and 10m wide.\n\nBut wait, the border along the width is only 280m because the planting area is 280m wide.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nImagine the border as consisting of two rectangles along the length and two rectangles along the width, each 10m wide.\n\nSo, the two rectangles along the length are each 500m long and 10m wide.\n\nSo, area for both is 2 * (500m * 10m) = 2 * 5,000 = 10,000 square meters.\n\nThe two rectangles along the width are each 300m long and 10m wide.\n\nBut wait, these would overlap at the corners if I just add them up.\n\nSo, actually, the total border area is the sum of the areas of these four rectangles minus the overlapping corner areas.\n\nEach corner is a square of 10m by 10m, so each corner overlap is 100 square meters.\n\nThere are four corners, so total overlap is 4 * 100 = 400 square meters.\n\nTherefore, border area = 2 * (500 * 10) + 2 * (300 * 10) - 4 * (10 * 10) = 2 * 5,000 + 2 * 3,000 - 4 * 100 = 10,000 + 6,000 - 400 = 15,600 square meters.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, border area is 15,600 square meters, and planting area is 134,400 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm getting the same answer, I can be more confident that 134,400 square meters is the correct planting area.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the dimensions again.\n\nOriginal field: 300m by 500m.\n\nBorder: 10m on all sides.\n\nSo, planting area dimensions:\n\nWidth: 300m - 2 * 10m = 280m.\n\nLength: 500m - 2 * 10m = 480m.\n\nArea: 280m * 480m = 134,400 square meters.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining portion of the field where he can plant corn is 134,400 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{134400} \\]"
