        "content": "So the shipping company wants to expand its fleet by adding five new ships, each with a capacity of 15,000 tons. Currently, they have 20 ships, each carrying up to 10,000 tons. They want to know the total increased capacity in percentage terms and estimate the cost of this expansion. Also, they need to consider the crew costs for these new ships. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current total capacity of the fleet. With 20 ships at 10,000 tons each, that's:\n\n20 ships * 10,000 tons/ship = 200,000 tons\n\nNext, the five new ships each have a capacity of 15,000 tons, so their total additional capacity is:\n\n5 ships * 15,000 tons/ship = 75,000 tons\n\nNow, to find the increased capacity in percentage terms, I should compare this additional capacity to the original capacity. The formula for percentage increase is:\n\n(Increased capacity / original capacity) * 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n(75,000 tons / 200,000 tons) * 100% = 37.5%\n\nSo, the total increased capacity is 37.5%.\n\nNext, estimating the cost of the new ships. Each new ship costs $50 million, and they're adding five of them:\n\n5 ships * $50 million/ship = $250 million\n\nThat's the upfront cost for the ships.\n\nNow, considering the crew costs. Each ship requires a crew of 25 members, and each crew member has an average annual salary of $60,000. First, let's find the annual crew cost per ship:\n\n25 crew members * $60,000/member = $1,500,000 per ship per year\n\nFor five new ships, that would be:\n\n5 ships * $1,500,000/ship/year = $7,500,000 per year\n\nSo, annually, the crew costs for the new ships will be $7.5 million.\n\nTo get a better understanding of the total cost, perhaps we can consider the cost over a certain period, say, 10 years. That would be:\n\n$7,500,000/year * 10 years = $75 million over 10 years\n\nAdding this to the initial cost of the ships:\n\n$250 million (ships) + $75 million (crew for 10 years) = $325 million over 10 years\n\nThis gives an idea of the total expenditure over a decade for the new ships, including both the purchase and the crew costs.\n\nAlternatively, if we look at the cost per ton of increased capacity, we can see how much each additional ton of capacity costs. The total increased capacity is 75,000 tons, and the total cost is $325 million. So:\n\n$325,000,000 / 75,000 tons = approximately $4,333.33 per ton\n\nThis might be useful for comparing with other potential investments or expansion options.\n\nAlso, it's worth considering if there are any other costs associated with the new ships, such as maintenance, fuel, port fees, etc. These could significantly impact the total cost of ownership. However, since those details aren't provided, I'll stick to the costs given: the purchase price and crew salaries.\n\nIn summary, the company can expect a 37.5% increase in capacity by adding five new ships, each with 15,000 tons capacity, at an initial cost of $250 million, plus annual crew costs of $7.5 million, leading to a total cost of $325 million over ten years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37.5\\% \\text{ increase in capacity, with an initial cost of } \\$250 \\text{ million and additional annual crew costs of } \\$7.5 \\text{ million}} \\]"
