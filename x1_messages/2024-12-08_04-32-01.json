        "content": "So there are 20 students in a classroom, and each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's a problem about counting the number of handshakes when every student shakes hands with every other student only once. So, no student shakes hands with the same student more than once, and of course, a student doesn't shake hands with themselves.\n\nOkay, so with 20 students, if each shakes hands with every other student, I need a way to calculate the total number of unique handshakes.\n\nLet me think about a smaller number of students to see if I can find a pattern or formula that I can apply to 20 students.\n\nSuppose there are 2 students: Student A and Student B. How many handshakes? Only 1 handshake between A and B.\n\nNow, 3 students: A, B, and C. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, B-C. That's 3 handshakes.\n\n4 students: A, B, C, D. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D. That's 6 handshakes.\n\n5 students: A, B, C, D, E. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, A-D, A-E, B-C, B-D, B-E, C-D, C-E, D-E. That's 10 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, let's see if there's a pattern here.\n\nFor 2 students: 1 handshake.\n\nFor 3 students: 3 handshakes.\n\nFor 4 students: 6 handshakes.\n\nFor 5 students: 10 handshakes.\n\nIt seems like with each additional student, the number of handshakes increases by the number of students already present. For example:\n\n- Starting with 2 students: 1 handshake.\n\n- Adding a third student: that student shakes hands with 2 existing students, adding 2 more handshakes, totaling 3.\n\n- Adding a fourth student: that student shakes hands with 3 existing students, adding 3 more handshakes, totaling 6.\n\n- Adding a fifth student: that student shakes hands with 4 existing students, adding 4 more handshakes, totaling 10.\n\nSo, for n students, the total number of handshakes seems to be the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers.\n\nWait, the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers is \\( \\frac{(n-1)n}{2} \\).\n\nYes, that formula comes from the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nSo, for n students, the total number of handshakes is \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\).\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier examples.\n\nFor n=2: \\( \\frac{2(2-1)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\times 1}{2} = 1 \\). Correct.\n\nFor n=3: \\( \\frac{3(3-1)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2} = 3 \\). Correct.\n\nFor n=4: \\( \\frac{4(4-1)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6 \\). Correct.\n\nFor n=5: \\( \\frac{5(5-1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10 \\). Correct.\n\nGreat, so this formula seems to work.\n\nNow, applying this to 20 students: \\( \\frac{20(20-1)}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = \\frac{380}{2} = 190 \\).\n\nSo, there are 190 handshakes in total.\n\nBut let me think about this another way to confirm.\n\nI recall that this is also related to combinations. Specifically, the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 20 to shake hands, which is the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n=20 and k=2, since a handshake involves 2 students.\n\nSo, \\( C(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times 18!} \\).\n\nNow, 20! is 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!, so the 18! cancels out.\n\nSo, \\( C(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{380}{2} = 190 \\).\n\nAgain, 190 handshakes.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it as each student shaking hands with every other student. So, the first student shakes hands with 19 others, the second student shakes hands with 18 remaining students (since they already shook hands with the first student), the third student shakes hands with 17 remaining students, and so on, until the last student, who has already shaken hands with everyone.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be 19 + 18 + 17 + ... + 1.\n\nThis is the sum of the first 19 natural numbers, which is \\( \\frac{19 \\times 20}{2} = 190 \\), again confirming the earlier result.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach I take, I end up with 190 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 190.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
