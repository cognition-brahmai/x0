        "content": "Alright, I'm here to help you with this Python script. So, the task is to read a text file that contains a list of numbers, each number on its own line. Then, we need to calculate the mean, median, and mode of these numbers. And importantly, we should only use standard Python libraries, meaning no external libraries like NumPy or statistics.\n\nFirst, let's break down what we need to do:\n\n1. **Read the file:** We need to open and read the text file, extracting the numbers from it.\n\n2. **Parse the numbers:** Ensure that the data read from the file is correctly converted into numbers (integers or floats).\n\n3. **Calculate the mean:** The mean is the average of the numbers, which is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers.\n\n4. **Calculate the median:** The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n5. **Calculate the mode:** The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. There can be multiple modes if several numbers appear the same maximum number of times.\n\nLet's tackle each part step by step.\n\n### 1. Read the file\n\nTo read a file in Python, we can use the built-in `open` function. We'll open the file in read mode (`'r'`). Assuming the file path is provided by the user or known, we'll read all lines from the file.\n\n```python\nwith open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n```\n\n### 2. Parse the numbers\n\nEach line in the file contains a number. We need to strip any whitespace (including the newline character) and convert the string to a float or integer. We'll assume the numbers are integers for simplicity, but using floats allows for more generality.\n\n```python\nnumbers = []\nfor line in lines:\n    number = float(line.strip())\n    numbers.append(number)\n```\n\n### 3. Calculate the mean\n\nThe mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.\n\n```python\nmean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n```\n\n### 4. Calculate the median\n\nTo find the median, we need to sort the list of numbers and then find the middle value(s).\n\nFirst, sort the list:\n\n```python\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n```\n\nThen, find the median:\n\n- If the number of observations is odd, the median is the middle number.\n\n- If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nWe can determine this using the length of the list:\n\n```python\nn = len(sorted_numbers)\nif n % 2 == 1:\n    median = sorted_numbers[n // 2]\nelse:\n    mid1 = sorted_numbers[(n // 2) - 1]\n    mid2 = sorted_numbers[n // 2]\n    median = (mid1 + mid2) / 2\n```\n\n### 5. Calculate the mode\n\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently. We can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ncounts = defaultdict(int)\nfor number in numbers:\n    counts[number] += 1\n\nmax_count = max(counts.values())\nmode = [number for number, count in counts.items() if count == max_count]\n```\n\nThis will give us a list of modes in case there are multiple numbers with the same highest frequency.\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nNow, let's combine all these steps into a single script.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Step 1: Read the file\n    with open('numbers.txt', 'r') as file:\n        lines = file.readlines()\n    \n    # Step 2: Parse the numbers\n    numbers = []\n    for line in lines:\n        number = float(line.strip())\n        numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the mean\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the median\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    n = len(sorted_numbers)\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        median = sorted_numbers[n // 2]\n    else:\n        mid1 = sorted_numbers[(n // 2) - 1]\n        mid2 = sorted_numbers[n // 2]\n        median = (mid1 + mid2) / 2\n    print(f\"Median: {median}\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Calculate the mode\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for number in numbers:\n        counts[number] += 1\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n    mode = [number for number, count in counts.items() if count == max_count]\n    print(f\"Mode: {mode}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the file:** We use `open` with `'r'` mode to read the file and `readlines` to get all lines.\n2. **Parsing numbers:** We strip each line and convert it to a float.\n3. **Mean calculation:** Sum of numbers divided by the count.\n4. **Median calculation:** Sort the list and find the middle value(s).\n5. **Mode calculation:** Use a dictionary to count occurrences and find the maximum count.\n\nThis script should work for a text file containing one number per line, using only standard Python libraries."
