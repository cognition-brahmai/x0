        "content": "Oh, that's an interesting one! So, there's this big animal that lives in the ocean, and it has a really noticeable feature\u2014a big tusk, kind of like a horn. And because of that, some people compare it to a unicorn, you know, like the mythical horse with a single horn. So, the \"unicorn of the sea\" must be referring to this marine mammal with the prominent tusk.\n\nNow, let's think about what marine mammals have tusks. There are several animals in the ocean, but not many are known for having large tusks. Whales come to mind, but most whales don't have tusks; they have baleen or teeth, but not typically tusks. Then there are dolphins, which are also mammals, but they don't have tusks either.\n\nWait, what about narwhals? I've heard of narwhals, and I think they have long tusks. Is that right? Yeah, narwhals are a type of whale, specifically a toothed whale, and they are known for their long, spiraled tusks. Males especially have these prominent tusks, which are actually elongated teeth. So, could the \"unicorn of the sea\" be referring to the narwhal?\n\nAnother candidate might be the walrus. Walruses have large tusks too, but they are more associated with the Arctic regions and are known for their mustache-like whiskers and their ability to live on both land and sea. But, compared to narwhals, walruses are more commonly known for their tusks, which they use for various purposes like helping them haul out onto ice, for aggression, and for sensing their environment.\n\nSo, between narwhals and walruses, which one is more likely to be called the \"unicorn of the sea\"? Narwhals have that single, long tusk that protrudes from their head, similar to a unicorn's horn. In contrast, walruses have two tusks, one on each side of their snout. So, the narwhal's single tusk might be more reminiscent of a unicorn's horn.\n\nAdditionally, narwhals are often referred to as the \"unicorns of the sea\" because of this unique feature. There are even some myths and legends associated with narwhal tusks, as they were once thought to be the horns of unicorns and were highly valued in medieval times.\n\nOn the other hand, walruses are also fascinating animals with their own unique characteristics, but they might not be as directly compared to unicorns due to having two tusks instead of one.\n\nSo, considering all this, I would say that the marine mammal being referred to as the \"unicorn of the sea\" is the narwhal. What do you think? Is there any other animal that fits this description better?"
