        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A in 8 hours. I need to find out how long it will take to produce 750 units if the production rate stays the same.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the production rate per hour. So, if 500 units are produced in 8 hours, the rate is 500 units divided by 8 hours. Let me calculate that:\n\n500 \u00f7 8 = 62.5 units per hour.\n\nSo, the factory produces 62.5 units each hour.\n\nNow, I need to produce 750 units. If the factory makes 62.5 units every hour, I can find out how many hours it will take to reach 750 units by dividing 750 by 62.5.\n\n750 \u00f7 62.5 = ?\n\nLet me do this calculation. 62.5 times 12 is 750, because 62.5 \u00d7 12 = 750.\n\nSo, it will take 12 hours to produce 750 units if the production rate remains constant.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 500 units take 8 hours, then 750 units will take x hours, assuming the rate is constant.\n\nSo, I can set up a proportion:\n\n500 units / 8 hours = 750 units / x hours\n\nNow, cross-multiplying:\n\n500x = 8 \u00d7 750\n\n500x = 6000\n\nNow, divide both sides by 500:\n\nx = 6000 / 500\n\nx = 12 hours.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at it? Maybe in terms of scaling.\n\nIf 500 units take 8 hours, then to find out how long 750 units will take, I can see how many times 500 goes into 750.\n\n750 \u00f7 500 = 1.5\n\nSo, it's 1.5 times the original production.\n\nTherefore, the time should also be 1.5 times the original time.\n\nOriginal time is 8 hours, so 8 \u00d7 1.5 = 12 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods. So, I can be confident that 12 hours is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
