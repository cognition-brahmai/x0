        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1000 units of product A and 2000 units of product B each day. For product A, each unit needs 3 workers, and for product B, each unit needs 2 workers. I need to find out how many workers the factory needs in total to operate at full capacity.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of workers needed for product A. Since each unit of product A requires 3 workers, and they produce 1000 units per day, I can multiply the number of units by the number of workers per unit. So, that's 1000 units times 3 workers per unit.\n\n1000 * 3 = 3000 workers for product A.\n\nNext, for product B, each unit requires 2 workers, and they produce 2000 units per day. So, I'll multiply 2000 units by 2 workers per unit.\n\n2000 * 2 = 4000 workers for product B.\n\nNow, to find the total number of workers needed, I should add the workers for product A and product B together.\n\n3000 (for A) + 4000 (for B) = 7000 workers in total.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's any overlap in the workers or if some workers can be shared between the two products. The question doesn't mention anything about workers being shared, so I'll assume that the workers are dedicated to their respective products.\n\nAlso, the question is about the number of workers needed to operate at full capacity, which means producing 1000 units of A and 2000 units of B per day. So, my calculation should be correct.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Maybe the workers can be reused across different units within the day, meaning that the same worker can work on multiple units in a day. If that's the case, then the total number of workers needed might be less.\n\nHowever, the way the question is phrased, it says \"each unit of product A requires 3 workers to produce,\" which suggests that for each unit, there are 3 distinct workers involved in its production. It doesn't specify if those workers are dedicated only to that unit or if they can be shared across units.\n\nTo get a more accurate answer, I need to clarify what \"requires 3 workers to produce\" means. Does it mean that each unit requires 3 workers simultaneously, or that 3 different workers are involved in the production process of each unit, but possibly sequentially?\n\nIf it's the former, meaning that each unit of product A needs 3 workers at the same time, then my initial calculation stands. If it's the latter, meaning that 3 workers are involved in the process, perhaps in sequence, then it's possible that fewer workers could be used if the production is staggered.\n\nBut given the information provided, I think the safest assumption is that the number of workers required is as calculated initially.\n\nSo, the factory needs 7000 workers to operate at full capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7000} \\]"
