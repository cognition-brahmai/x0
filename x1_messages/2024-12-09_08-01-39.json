        "content": "So I've got this problem about planning a sports complex, and I need to figure out how many basketball courts can be built along with a soccer field and a swimming pool on a 100,000 square foot plot of land. There are some specific requirements for each facility, and also needing to leave space for parking and landscaping. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the space requirements for each component:\n\n- Soccer field: at least 50,000 square feet.\n\n- Swimming pool: 20,000 square feet.\n\n- Each basketball court: 5,000 square feet.\n\n- Plus, some space for parking and landscaping.\n\nThe total land is 100,000 square feet. So, I need to allocate space for the soccer field, swimming pool, several basketball courts, and then have some left over for parking and landscaping.\n\nLet me start by subtracting the minimum required space for the soccer field and the swimming pool from the total land area.\n\nTotal land area: 100,000 sq ft\n\nSoccer field: 50,000 sq ft\n\nSwimming pool: 20,000 sq ft\n\nSo, 100,000 - 50,000 - 20,000 = 30,000 sq ft left for basketball courts and parking/landscaping.\n\nNow, I need to decide how much of this remaining 30,000 sq ft should be allocated to basketball courts and how much to parking and landscaping. But the problem doesn't specify exact requirements for parking and landscaping, so I might need to make some assumptions here.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to reserve a certain amount for parking and landscaping and then use the rest for basketball courts. Or maybe it wants me to maximize the number of basketball courts while ensuring there's some space left for parking and landscaping.\n\nLet me think about this. Maybe I should assume that a certain percentage or a fixed amount of space is needed for parking and landscaping. But since the problem doesn't specify, I might need to consider that all the remaining space after allocating for the soccer field and swimming pool can be used for basketball courts and parking/landscaping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to allocate a specific amount for parking and landscaping. For example, maybe it's standard to have a certain number of parking spaces per sports facility, but again, without specific numbers, it's hard to say.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the remaining space after allocating for the soccer field, swimming pool, and basketball courts for parking and landscaping, and I need to ensure that there is some positive amount left for those purposes.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to make sure that after allocating space for the soccer field, swimming pool, and x number of basketball courts, there is still some space left for parking and landscaping.\n\nLet me denote the number of basketball courts as n. Each basketball court requires 5,000 sq ft, so n * 5,000 sq ft is the total space needed for basketball courts.\n\nThen, the total space used would be:\n\nSoccer field: 50,000 sq ft\n\nSwimming pool: 20,000 sq ft\n\nBasketball courts: n * 5,000 sq ft\n\nTotal space used: 50,000 + 20,000 + 5,000n = 70,000 + 5,000n sq ft\n\nThe remaining space for parking and landscaping would be:\n\n100,000 - (70,000 + 5,000n) = 30,000 - 5,000n sq ft\n\nNow, since we need to have some space left for parking and landscaping, this remaining space should be greater than zero.\n\nSo, 30,000 - 5,000n > 0\n\nSolving for n:\n\n30,000 > 5,000n\n\nDivide both sides by 5,000:\n\n6 > n\n\nOr n < 6\n\nSince n has to be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a basketball court), the maximum number of basketball courts that can be built is 5.\n\nLet me check this.\n\nIf n = 5:\n\nTotal space used: 50,000 (soccer) + 20,000 (pool) + 5 * 5,000 (basketball) = 50,000 + 20,000 + 25,000 = 95,000 sq ft\n\nRemaining space: 100,000 - 95,000 = 5,000 sq ft for parking and landscaping.\n\nThat seems feasible.\n\nIf n = 6:\n\nTotal space used: 50,000 + 20,000 + 30,000 = 100,000 sq ft\n\nRemaining space: 0 sq ft, which is not enough since we need some space for parking and landscaping.\n\nTherefore, n must be less than 6.\n\nBut maybe the problem allows for n = 6 if parking and landscaping can share the same space or if they are built underground or something, but based on the information given, I think it's safe to assume that n = 5 is the maximum number of basketball courts that can be built while still leaving some space for parking and landscaping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants me to consider that parking and landscaping require a specific amount of space, and I need to account for that.\n\nFor example, maybe parking requires a certain number of spaces, each taking up a certain amount of space, and landscaping requires a certain percentage of the total area.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I think the approach I took is reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer is that up to 5 basketball courts can be built in the sports complex.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
