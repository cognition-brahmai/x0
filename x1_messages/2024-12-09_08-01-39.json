        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To create a Python script that interacts with a Redis server, you'll need to have Redis installed and running on your machine or have access to a Redis server. Additionally, you'll need the `redis` Python package installed in your environment.\n\nFirst, make sure you have the `redis` package installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install redis\n```\n\nNext, you'll need to know the connection details for your Redis server, such as the host address and port. For local development, the host is usually `'localhost'` and the port is `6379`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to creating the script:\n\n1. **Connect to the Redis server**.\n2. **Store key-value pairs** based on user input.\n3. **Retrieve values** based on user input.\n\nBelow is a sample Python script that accomplishes these tasks:\n\n```python\nimport redis\n\ndef main():\n    # Connect to the local Redis server\n    r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)\n    \n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n        print(\"1. Set a key-value pair\")\n        print(\"2. Get a value by key\")\n        print(\"3. Exit\")\n        \n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3): \")\n        \n        if choice == '1':\n            key = input(\"Enter the key: \")\n            value = input(\"Enter the value: \")\n            r.set(key, value)\n            print(f\"Key-value pair '{key}':'{value}' set successfully.\")\n        \n        elif choice == '2':\n            key = input(\"Enter the key to retrieve: \")\n            value = r.get(key)\n            if value:\n                print(f\"The value for key '{key}' is: {value.decode('utf-8')}\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"No value found for key '{key}'.\")\n        \n        elif choice == '3':\n            print(\"Exiting the program.\")\n            break\n        \n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter 1, 2, or 3.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Connecting to Redis**:\n   - We use `redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)` to connect to the local Redis server. Adjust the host and port if your Redis server is running on different credentials.\n\n2. **Setting Key-Value Pairs**:\n   - The user is prompted to enter a key and a value.\n   - We use `r.set(key, value)` to store the key-value pair in Redis.\n\n3. **Getting Values by Key**:\n   - The user is prompted to enter a key.\n   - We use `r.get(key)` to retrieve the value associated with the key.\n   - If the key exists, we decode the value from bytes to a string and display it; otherwise, we inform the user that no value was found for the given key.\n\n4. **Exiting the Program**:\n   - The user can choose to exit the program by selecting option 3.\n\nThis script provides a simple interactive way to set and get key-value pairs in a Redis database using Python. Make sure your Redis server is running before executing this script."
