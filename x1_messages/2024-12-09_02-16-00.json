        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"How many ways can you arrange the letters of the word 'MATHEMATICS' such that no two vowels are adjacent to each other?\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I need to identify the vowels in the word 'MATHEMATICS'. The vowels are A, E, A, I. So, there are 4 vowels in total, and they are A, E, A, I.\n\nNext, I need to find the total number of ways to arrange the letters such that no two vowels are next to each other. That means that between any two vowels, there should be at least one consonant.\n\nLet's start by arranging the consonants. In 'MATHEMATICS', the consonants are M, T, H, M, T, C, S. So, we have M, T, H, M, T, C, S. Wait, how many consonants are there? Let's count: M appears twice, T appears twice, and the others appear once each. So, total consonants are 7.\n\nNow, I need to arrange these 7 consonants, taking into account that M and T repeat twice. The number of distinct arrangements of these consonants is 7! divided by 2! for M and 2! for T. So, that's 7! / (2! * 2!) = 1260.\n\nAlright, so there are 1260 ways to arrange the consonants.\n\nNow, I need to place the vowels in such a way that no two vowels are adjacent. To do this, I can think about the positions between the consonants where the vowels can be placed.\n\nIf I have 7 consonants arranged, there are 8 possible slots where vowels can be placed: one before the first consonant, one after the last consonant, and one between each pair of consonants.\n\nSo, for example, if the consonants are arranged as _C1_C2_C3_C4_C5_C6_C7_, there are 8 underscores where vowels can be placed.\n\nSince no two vowels can be adjacent, I need to place each vowel in a different slot.\n\nI have 4 vowels to place in these 8 slots, with no more than one vowel per slot.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 slots out of 8 is C(8,4), which is 70.\n\nNow, for each of these choices of slots, I need to arrange the 4 vowels in them. The vowels are A, E, A, I. So, there are 4 vowels with A repeating twice.\n\nThe number of distinct arrangements of these vowels is 4! / 2! = 12.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to place the vowels is 70 * 12 = 840.\n\nFinally, to get the total number of arrangements of the entire word with the given condition, I multiply the number of ways to arrange the consonants by the number of ways to arrange the vowels in the slots.\n\nSo, total arrangements = 1260 * 840.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure this is correct.\n\nWait a minute, I think I need to double-check my approach.\n\nIs there a better way to handle this?\n\nAlternatively, I can think of arranging the consonants first, which we've done in 1260 ways, and then choosing positions for the vowels among the gaps.\n\nYes, that's what I did.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the indistinctness of the vowels more carefully.\n\nWait, the vowels are A, E, A, I. So, there are two A's, which are identical.\n\nSo, when arranging the vowels in the selected slots, the number of distinct arrangements is indeed 4! / 2! = 12.\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose the slots is C(8,4) = 70.\n\nSo, yes, 70 * 12 = 840 ways to place the vowels.\n\nThen, multiply by the number of ways to arrange the consonants, which is 1260.\n\nSo, total arrangements would be 1260 * 840.\n\nBut let's calculate that.\n\n1260 * 840.\n\nFirst, 1260 * 800 = 1,008,000.\n\nThen, 1260 * 40 = 50,400.\n\nSo, total is 1,008,000 + 50,400 = 1,058,400.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is 1,058,400.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm if there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, some people might use the formula for permutations with restrictions.\n\nBut I think the method I used is standard: arrange the consonants first, then find the gaps for vowels, and arrange the vowels in those gaps.\n\nAnother way could be to arrange all the consonants and vowels and then subtract the arrangements where vowels are adjacent, but that might be more complicated.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 1,058,400.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1058400} \\]"
