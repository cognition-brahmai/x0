        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A farmer has 120 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular field. The length of the field is twice its width, and I need to find the dimensions that will maximize its area. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all the sides. So, if the width is W and the length is L, the perimeter P would be P = 2L + 2W. In this case, the farmer has 120 meters of fencing, so P = 120 meters.\n\nNow, it's given that the length is twice the width, so L = 2W. That's helpful because it allows me to express everything in terms of W.\n\nSubstituting L = 2W into the perimeter equation:\n\nP = 2(2W) + 2W = 4W + 2W = 6W\n\nAnd since P = 120 meters,\n\n6W = 120\n\nNow, solving for W:\n\nW = 120 / 6 = 20 meters\n\nThen, since L = 2W,\n\nL = 2 * 20 = 40 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions are 20 meters for the width and 40 meters for the length.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions maximizing the area. Let me make sure that this indeed maximizes the area.\n\nThe area A of a rectangle is A = L * W\n\nSubstituting L = 2W,\n\nA = 2W * W = 2W\u00b2\n\nNow, since the perimeter is fixed at 120 meters, and we've found W = 20 meters, let's see if this gives the maximum area.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that for a given perimeter, the area of a rectangle is maximized when it's a square. But in this case, it's specified that the length is twice the width, so it can't be a square. So, perhaps 20m by 40m is the optimal dimensions under this constraint.\n\nLet me verify by calculating the area:\n\nA = 40m * 20m = 800 m\u00b2\n\nIs there a way to get a larger area with the same perimeter and the length being twice the width? Let's see.\n\nSuppose I choose a different width, say W = 21m, then L = 2*21 = 42m\n\nBut then the perimeter would be 2*21 + 2*42 = 42 + 84 = 126m, which is more than 120m. That's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, W = 19m, then L = 38m\n\nPerimeter = 2*19 + 2*38 = 38 + 76 = 114m, which is less than 120m.\n\nBut in both cases, the area would be:\n\nFor W=19m, L=38m: A=19*38=722 m\u00b2\n\nFor W=21m, L=42m: A=21*42=882 m\u00b2, but perimeter exceeds 120m, so not acceptable.\n\nWait a minute, when W=20m, L=40m, P=120m, A=800 m\u00b2\n\nWhen W=19m, L=38m, P=114m, A=722 m\u00b2\n\nWhen W=21m, L=42m, P=126m, A=882 m\u00b2, but P>120m, not allowed.\n\nSo, even though A=882 m\u00b2 is larger than 800 m\u00b2, it violates the perimeter constraint. Therefore, 800 m\u00b2 is the maximum area possible under the given constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use calculus to find the maximum area.\n\nLet me define the perimeter equation:\n\nP = 2L + 2W = 120\n\nAnd L = 2W\n\nSo, 2*(2W) + 2W = 120\n\n4W + 2W = 120\n\n6W = 120\n\nW = 20m\n\nThen L = 40m\n\nArea A = L*W = 40*20 = 800 m\u00b2\n\nAlternatively, to use calculus, express A in terms of W:\n\nA = L*W = (2W)*W = 2W\u00b2\n\nSubject to 2L + 2W = 120, or L + W = 60\n\nBut since L = 2W, substitute:\n\n2W + W = 60\n\n3W = 60\n\nW = 20m\n\nThen L = 40m\n\nSo, same result.\n\nAlternatively, to use calculus, consider A = 2W\u00b2\n\nTo maximize A, take dA/dW = 4W, set to zero: 4W = 0 => W=0, which is not practical.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because W=0 isn't a maximum.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the constraint in the calculus approach.\n\nUsing Lagrange multipliers, let\u2019s define:\n\nf(W,L) = L*W (the area)\n\nSubject to g(L,W) = 2L + 2W - 120 = 0\n\nThe gradients are:\n\n\u2207f = (W, L)\n\n\u2207g = (2, 2)\n\nSet \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g:\n\nW = 2\u03bb\n\nL = 2\u03bb\n\nThus, W = L\n\nBut this contradicts L = 2W\n\nWait, perhaps Lagrange multipliers are overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, express L in terms of W from the constraint:\n\n2L + 2W = 120 => L + W = 60 => L = 60 - W\n\nThen, A = L*W = (60 - W)*W = 60W - W\u00b2\n\nNow, to maximize A, take dA/dW = 60 - 2W, set to zero:\n\n60 - 2W = 0 => W = 30m\n\nThen L = 60 - 30 = 30m\n\nBut this would make L = W, which contradicts L = 2W\n\nWait, in the problem, it's given that L = 2W, so perhaps this approach is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to maximize area given the perimeter and the condition L = 2W.\n\nIn that case, as previously calculated, W = 20m, L = 40m, A = 800 m\u00b2 is the solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to maximize area with perimeter 120m, without the L = 2W condition, in which case, as per the calculus approach, W = 30m, L = 30m, which would be a square, and A = 900 m\u00b2.\n\nBut since the problem specifies L = 2W, then the maximum area under that constraint is 800 m\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions are width = 20m, length = 40m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{width } = 20 \\text{ meters}, \\text{ length } = 40 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
