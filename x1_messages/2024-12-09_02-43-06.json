        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains starting from opposite ends of a 500 km track, going towards each other. One train is going at 70 km/h and the other at 80 km/h. I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I should probably think about relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds should add up. So, 70 km/h plus 80 km/h is 150 km/h. That means together, they're closing the distance between them at 150 km per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between them is 500 km. So, if they're closing in at 150 km/h, the time it takes for them to meet should be the distance divided by their combined speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed, which is 500 km divided by 150 km/h.\n\nLet me calculate that: 500 divided by 150 is... hmm, 500 divided by 150 is equal to 500/150, which simplifies to 10/3, which is approximately 3.333 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should express that in hours and minutes. Since 0.333 hours is roughly 20 minutes (because 0.333 times 60 minutes is 20 minutes), so it's about 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if I'm doing this correctly. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to think about the individual distances each train covers until they meet. Let's say train A is going at 70 km/h and train B at 80 km/h. Let t be the time in hours until they meet.\n\nIn that time t, train A would have traveled 70t kilometers, and train B would have traveled 80t kilometers. Since they're moving towards each other from 500 km apart, the sum of the distances they travel should equal 500 km.\n\nSo, 70t + 80t = 500\n\nCombining like terms, that's 150t = 500\n\nThen, t = 500 / 150 = 10/3 hours, which is again about 3.333 hours or 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nOkay, that matches my first method. So, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nBut maybe there's something else I should consider, like whether the tracks are straight or curved, or if there's any acceleration or deceleration. But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume constant speeds on straight tracks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the concept of relative motion, where one train is moving towards the other at its speed plus the other train's speed. But that's essentially what I did in the first method.\n\nLet me think if there's another perspective. Suppose I consider the position of train A as a function of time and train B's position as a function of time, and set them equal to find when they meet.\n\nLet's assume train A starts at position 0 and train B starts at position 500 km.\n\nTrain A's position at time t is s_A = 70t\n\nTrain B's position at time t is s_B = 500 - 80t\n\nThey meet when s_A = s_B, so 70t = 500 - 80t\n\nAdding 80t to both sides: 150t = 500\n\nThen, t = 500 / 150 = 10/3 hours, same as before.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting the same answer, which is 10/3 hours or approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider units and significant figures.\n\nThe distance is given as 500 km, which has two significant figures, and speeds are 70 km/h and 80 km/h, both with two significant figures. So, the answer should also be reported with two significant figures.\n\n10/3 hours is approximately 3.333 hours, which, to two significant figures, is 3.3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, in hours and minutes, 0.3 hours is 0.3 * 60 = 18 minutes. So, it would be 3 hours and 18 minutes.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 20 minutes, but actually, 0.333*60 is closer to 20 minutes, but with 0.3*60=18 minutes, which is more precise.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should report the answer as 3 hours and 18 minutes, considering significant figures.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to stick with the fractional form, 10/3 hours, which is the exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in hours and minutes, then 3 hours and 20 minutes would be acceptable, considering that 0.333*60 is approximately 20 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the exact value, 0.333...*60=20 minutes exactly.\n\nWait, 0.333... is 1/3, and 1/3*60=20 minutes exactly.\n\nSo, 10/3 hours is exactly 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nBut considering significant figures from the given data, perhaps I should report it as 3.3 hours or 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nI think reporting it as 3 hours and 20 minutes is fine, as it's a common way to express time.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in decimal form, then 3.3 hours would be acceptable.\n\nBut to be precise and considerate of significant figures, perhaps I should stick with 3.3 hours.\n\nWait, but 500 km has three significant figures, actually, since zero after the non-zero digit is significant in measurement. So, 500 km has three significant figures.\n\nSimilarly, 70 km/h and 80 km/h each have two significant figures.\n\nSo, the answer should be reported with two significant figures.\n\nTherefore, 3.3 hours is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if expressing in minutes, 3 hours and 20 minutes is 200 minutes, which is 2.0*10^2 minutes, keeping two significant figures.\n\nBut I think the problem expects the answer in hours.\n\nSo, 3.3 hours is fine.\n\nWait, but 10/3 is 3.333..., which, to two significant figures, is 3.3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if considering the fraction, 10/3 is more precise.\n\nBut perhaps I should present the answer as 10/3 hours or approximately 3.33 hours.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects a decimal, I'll go with 3.3 hours.\n\nJust to confirm, let me see if there's another way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there any possibility that the trains are not moving at constant speeds, or that the track isn't straight, or that there are stops along the way? The problem doesn't mention any of that, so I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trains are moving on parallel tracks, but since it's said they're moving towards each other, they must be on the same track or on tracks that converge.\n\nBut given the problem states \"opposite ends of a 500km track,\" it's safe to assume they're on the same track moving towards each other.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the time until they meet is 10/3 hours, or approximately 3.33 hours, which, considering significant figures, should be reported as 3.3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, in hours and minutes, it's 3 hours and 20 minutes, which is also acceptable.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects the answer in hours, I'll go with 3.3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
