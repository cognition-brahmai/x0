        "content": "Let's see. There's this store that's offering a 20% discount on an item that originally costs $80. Then, after applying the discount, they add a 10% sales tax on the discounted price. I need to find out what the final price is.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much the discount is. A 20% discount on $80. To calculate that, I can multiply 80 by 20% and subtract that from the original price.\n\nWait, actually, I know that percentage can be tricky sometimes, so maybe I should think about it step by step.\n\nSo, 20% of 80 is calculated as 0.20 times 80, right?\n\nLet me do that: 0.20 \u00d7 80 = 16.\n\nSo, the discount is $16.\n\nNow, subtract that discount from the original price: 80 - 16 = 64.\n\nSo, the discounted price is $64.\n\nNext, they add a 10% sales tax on this discounted price. So, I need to calculate 10% of $64 and then add that to the $64.\n\nFirst, calculate 10% of 64.\n\n10% of 64 is 0.10 \u00d7 64 = 6.4.\n\nSo, the sales tax is $6.40.\n\nNow, add that to the discounted price: 64 + 6.4 = 70.4.\n\nTherefore, the final price of the item is $70.40.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe there's a shorter way to calculate it without finding the discount and tax separately.\n\nLet me think.\n\nInitially, the item is $80, and there's a 20% discount. So, after a 20% discount, you're paying 80% of the original price.\n\nBecause 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, 80% of 80 is 0.80 \u00d7 80 = 64.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier for the discounted price.\n\nThen, a 10% sales tax is added to the discounted price. So, you're paying an additional 10% on $64.\n\nAlternatively, paying 10% extra is like multiplying by 1.10.\n\nSo, 64 \u00d7 1.10 = 70.4.\n\nAgain, that's $70.40.\n\nIs there a way to combine these steps into one calculation?\n\nYes, maybe.\n\nStarting with the original price, apply the discount and then the tax in one go.\n\nFirst, the discount: 20% off means you pay 80% of the original price.\n\nThen, you add 10% sales tax on the discounted price, which is like multiplying by 1.10.\n\nSo, overall, it's original price \u00d7 0.80 \u00d7 1.10.\n\nLet me try that: 80 \u00d7 0.80 \u00d7 1.10.\n\nFirst, 80 \u00d7 0.80 = 64.\n\nThen, 64 \u00d7 1.10 = 70.4.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, you could think of it as the final price is the original price multiplied by the discount factor and then by the tax factor.\n\nSo, final price = original price \u00d7 (1 - discount%) \u00d7 (1 + tax%).\n\nIn this case, that's 80 \u00d7 (1 - 0.20) \u00d7 (1 + 0.10) = 80 \u00d7 0.80 \u00d7 1.10 = 70.4.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this to confirm?\n\nMaybe think in terms of the total percentage change.\n\nFirst, a 20% discount, then a 10% increase due to tax.\n\nThe net effect is not just 20% - 10% = 10% discount, because the tax is applied to the discounted price, not the original price.\n\nSo, it's not a straightforward subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the overall multiplier.\n\nDiscount multiplier: 0.80.\n\nTax multiplier: 1.10.\n\nOverall multiplier: 0.80 \u00d7 1.10 = 0.88.\n\nSo, final price is original price \u00d7 0.88 = 80 \u00d7 0.88 = 70.4.\n\nAgain, $70.40.\n\nAlternatively, 0.88 is equivalent to 88% of the original price.\n\nSo, the final price is 88% of $80, which is 0.88 \u00d7 80 = 70.4.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways.\n\nTherefore, the final price of the item is $70.40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70.40} \\]"
