        "content": "To find out what percentage of species on Earth are insects, we can use the following formula for percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"part\" is the number of insect species, which is approximately 950,000, and the \"whole\" is the total number of species on Earth, which is approximately 7.9 million.\n\nFirst, let's make sure both numbers are in the same unit. Since 7.9 million is 7,900,000, we can proceed.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{950,000}{7,900,000} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nNow, let's simplify the fraction before multiplying by 100.\n\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by 1,000 to make it easier:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{950,000}{7,900,000} = \\frac{950}{7,900}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this further by dividing both numerator and denominator by 50:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{950 \\div 50}{7,900 \\div 50} = \\frac{19}{158}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the decimal value of this fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{19}{158} \\approx 0.1196\n\\]\n\nThen, to find the percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n0.1196 \\times 100 = 11.96\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, approximately 11.96% of the species on Earth are insects.\n\nHowever, to check if this makes sense, let's consider that the estimate of insect species is about 950,000 out of approximately 7.9 million total species. Doing a quick mental math:\n\n950,000 divided by 7,900,000 is roughly 0.12, and 0.12 times 100 is 12%. So, 11.96% is reasonable.\n\nIt's also worth noting that estimates of species numbers can vary, and the total number of species on Earth is continually being revised as new species are discovered and classified. But based on the numbers provided, approximately 12% of species on Earth are insects.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.96\\%} \\]"
