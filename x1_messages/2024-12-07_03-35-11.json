        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We start with 120 birds on a tree.\n\nFirst, half of them fly away. So, half of 120 is 60. That means 60 birds fly away, leaving 60 birds still on the tree.\n\nNext, one-third of the remaining birds fly away. So, one-third of 60 is 20. That means 20 more birds fly away, leaving 60 minus 20, which is 40 birds still on the tree.\n\nFinally, one-fourth of the remaining birds fly away. So, one-fourth of 40 is 10. That means 10 more birds fly away, leaving 40 minus 10, which is 30 birds still on the tree.\n\nSo, the number of birds left on the tree is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
