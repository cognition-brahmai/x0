        "content": "So here's this game show problem that's been bugging me. There are three doors, one has a car behind it, and the other two have goats. You pick a door, and then the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. Then, you have the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the other unopened door. The question is, what's the probability of winning the car if you always decide to switch doors?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the setup clearly. There are three doors:\n\n- Door 1\n\n- Door 2\n\n- Door 3\n\nBehind one of them is a car, and behind the other two are goats. The contestant picks a door, say Door 1. Then, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door, say Door 3, to reveal a goat. Now, the contestant has the option to stick with Door 1 or switch to Door 2.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of winning the car if the contestant always switches doors.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what's the probability that the contestant initially picks the car? Well, there are three doors, so the probability of picking the car initially is 1/3.\n\nThat means the probability of picking a goat initially is 2/3.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. The host always opens a door with a goat behind it, and this action gives the contestant new information.\n\nLet's consider two scenarios:\n\n1. The contestant initially picks the car (probability 1/3).\n\n2. The contestant initially picks a goat (probability 2/3).\n\n**Scenario 1: Contestant picks the car initially.**\n\n- Contestant picks Door 1 (car).\n\n- Host opens Door 3 (goat).\n\n- If contestant switches to Door 2, they get a goat.\n\n- If they stick with Door 1, they get the car.\n\n**Scenario 2: Contestant picks a goat initially.**\n\n- Contestant picks Door 1 (goat).\n\n- Host opens Door 3 (goat).\n\n- If contestant switches to Door 2, they get the car.\n\n- If they stick with Door 1, they get a goat.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, which happens with probability 1/3, switching loses the car.\n\nIn Scenario 2, which happens with probability 2/3, switching wins the car.\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning the car by switching is the probability of initially picking a goat, which is 2/3.\n\nWait a minute, that seems counterintuitive. Most people think that after one door is opened, there are two doors left, so the probability should be 50/50. But according to this, it's better to switch, as the probability of winning by switching is 2/3.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently.\n\nMaybe I can list all possible scenarios.\n\nLet's assume the car is behind Door 1.\n\n- Contestant picks Door 1.\n\n- Host opens either Door 2 or Door 3 (both have goats).\n\n- If contestant switches, they get a goat.\n\n- If they stick, they get the car.\n\nNow, assume the car is behind Door 2.\n\n- Contestant picks Door 1 (goat).\n\n- Host opens Door 3 (goat).\n\n- If contestant switches to Door 2, they get the car.\n\nSimilarly, if the car is behind Door 3.\n\n- Contestant picks Door 1 (goat).\n\n- Host opens Door 2 (goat).\n\n- If contestant switches to Door 3, they get the car.\n\nSo, in three possible scenarios:\n\n1. Car behind Door 1: switching loses.\n\n2. Car behind Door 2: switching wins.\n\n3. Car behind Door 3: switching wins.\n\nSo, in two out of three scenarios, switching wins the car. Therefore, the probability is 2/3.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. But why does it feel like it should be 50/50? Maybe because after one door is opened, there are only two doors left, so it seems like each should have a 50% chance.\n\nBut the key here is that the host's action is not random. The host always opens a door with a goat, which means they are providing information based on their knowledge.\n\nIn other words, by opening a door with a goat, the host is concentrating the 2/3 probability of the car being behind the other two doors onto the single remaining unchosen door.\n\nLet me try to explain this another way.\n\nInitially, when the contestant picks a door, there's a 1/3 chance it's the car and a 2/3 chance it's a goat.\n\nAfter the host opens a door with a goat, which they always do, the probability distribution changes.\n\nIf the contestant initially picked a goat (which happens with 2/3 probability), then switching will always get them the car.\n\nIf they initially picked the car (1/3 probability), switching will get them a goat.\n\nTherefore, switching wins the car in the 2/3 cases where they initially picked a goat.\n\nSo, the probability of winning by switching is 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding the problem to 100 doors: one car and 99 goats.\n\nYou pick one door (1/100 chance of car).\n\nThe host opens 98 doors with goats.\n\nNow, should you switch to the remaining door or stick with your original choice?\n\nIntuitively, it seems like switching would be beneficial because the host has essentially pointed out the one door that's likely to have the car.\n\nIn this case, the probability of initially picking the car is 1/100, so the probability of the car being behind another door is 99/100.\n\nWhen the host opens 98 doors with goats, the entire 99/100 probability concentrates on the one remaining door.\n\nTherefore, switching gives a 99/100 chance of winning the car.\n\nThis extreme case helps illustrate why switching is advantageous in the original three-door problem.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of winning the car if the contestant always switches doors is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
