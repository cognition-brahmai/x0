Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\n1. DuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information online. It finds a list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\n2. WebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\n3. HyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\n4. ALM[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text.  The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E0 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [#E[n], which contains the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the population of Tokyo and what are some popular tourist attractions there?"

I need to extract relevant information from these search results. I can use the HyperlinkExtractor to get the links from the search results and then use WebScraper to extract information from those links.\n#E2 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E0]\n#E3 = WebScraper[#E2]\n\nPlan: Similarly, extract links from the tourist attractions search results and scrape those pages.\n#E4 = HyperlinkExtractor[#E1]\n#E5 = WebScraper[#E4]\n\nPlan: With the scraped text from both searches, I can now use the ALM to summarize the population and list the tourist attractions.\n#E6 = ALM[What is the population of Tokyo? Given context: #E3]\n#E7 = ALM[What are some popular tourist attractions in Tokyo? Given context: #E5]\n\nPlan: Finally, combine the answers from ALM to provide a comprehensive response to the user.\nAnswer: The population of Tokyo is #E6, and some popular tourist attractions there include #E7."
