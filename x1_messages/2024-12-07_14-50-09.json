        "content": "Let's see. I have this election problem here. There are three candidates: A, B, and C. Candidate A received 55% of the total votes, candidate B got 35%, and candidate C got the remaining 10%. Also, it's mentioned that candidate A won by a margin of 5000 votes over candidate B. I need to find out how many total votes were cast in the election.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I need to find the total number of votes, which I'll call T for total votes.\n\nNow, candidate A has 55% of T, which is 0.55T.\n\nCandidate B has 35% of T, which is 0.35T.\n\nCandidate C has 10% of T, which is 0.10T.\n\nThe problem states that candidate A won by a margin of 5000 votes over candidate B. That means the difference between A's votes and B's votes is 5000.\n\nSo, A's votes minus B's votes equals 5000.\n\nThat is: 0.55T - 0.35T = 5000.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.55T - 0.35T = 0.20T.\n\nSo, 0.20T = 5000.\n\nNow, to find T, I can divide both sides by 0.20:\n\nT = 5000 / 0.20.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n5000 divided by 0.20 is the same as 5000 divided by 1/5, which is 5000 * 5/1 = 25,000.\n\nSo, the total votes cast were 25,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf T is 25,000, then:\n\nA's votes: 0.55 * 25,000 = 13,750.\n\nB's votes: 0.35 * 25,000 = 8,750.\n\nC's votes: 0.10 * 25,000 = 2,500.\n\nNow, the difference between A and B is 13,750 - 8,750 = 5,000, which matches the margin given in the problem.\n\nSo, my answer seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nPerhaps using equations.\n\nLet T be the total votes.\n\nA = 0.55T\n\nB = 0.35T\n\nC = 0.10T\n\nAnd A - B = 5000.\n\nSo, 0.55T - 0.35T = 5000 \u2192 0.20T = 5000 \u2192 T = 5000 / 0.20 = 25,000.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of percentages.\n\nThe difference between A and B is 20% (55% - 35%), and that 20% corresponds to 5000 votes.\n\nSo, 20% of T is 5000.\n\nTherefore, T = 5000 / 0.20 = 25,000.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\nSo, the total votes cast in the election were 25,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25000} \\]"
