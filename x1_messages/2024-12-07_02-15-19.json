        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $1.20 per pound and oranges for $0.80 per pound. The customer buys 3 pounds of apples and 4 pounds of oranges. I need to find the total cost.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of the apples. Apples are $1.20 per pound, and the customer buys 3 pounds. So, the cost for apples is 1.20 multiplied by 3. Let me do that: 1.20 \u00d7 3 = 3.60. So, the apples cost $3.60.\n\nNext, the cost of the oranges. Oranges are $0.80 per pound, and the customer buys 4 pounds. So, the cost for oranges is 0.80 multiplied by 4. That's 0.80 \u00d7 4 = 3.20. So, the oranges cost $3.20.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together. That's 3.60 + 3.20. Let's add those up: 3.60 + 3.20 = 6.80.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $6.80.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, apples: $1.20 per pound \u00d7 3 pounds = $3.60. That seems correct.\n\nOranges: $0.80 per pound \u00d7 4 pounds = $3.20. That also seems correct.\n\nTotal cost: $3.60 + $3.20 = $6.80. Yeah, that adds up.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.80} \\]"
