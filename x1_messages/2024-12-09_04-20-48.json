        "content": "To calculate the present value (PV) of a $10,000 investment that will mature in five years at an annual interest rate of 6%, compounded annually, we can use the formula for the present value of a future sum of money:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( PV \\) is the present value.\n- \\( FV \\) is the future value, which is $10,000 in this case.\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal), which is 6% or 0.06.\n- \\( n \\) is the number of years, which is 5.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10,000}{(1 + 0.06)^5} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0.06 = 1.06 \\]\n\nThen raise 1.06 to the power of 5:\n\n\\[ 1.06^5 \\approx 1.3382255776 \\]\n\nNow, divide the future value by this amount:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{10,000}{1.3382255776} \\approx 7,472.58 \\]\n\nTherefore, the present value of the $10,000 investment, given a 6% annual interest rate compounded annually over five years, is approximately $7,472.58.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe present value calculation determines how much a future sum of money is worth today, considering the time value of money and the interest rate. In this scenario, receiving $10,000 in five years is equivalent to receiving approximately $7,472.58 today, assuming a 6% annual interest rate compounded annually. This is because if you invest $7,472.58 today at 6% per year, compounded annually, it will grow to $10,000 in five years."
