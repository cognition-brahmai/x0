A wind of early autumn raised yellow dust from cobbles and swirled it against an hundred windows. Long streamers of garments fluttered from fire-escapes. In all unhandy places there were buckets, brooms, rags and bottles. In the street infants played or fought with other infants or sat stupidly in the way of vehicles. Formidable women, with uncombed hair and disordered dress, gossiped while leaning on railings, or screamed in frantic quarrels. Withered persons, in curious postures of submission to something, sat smoking pipes in obscure corners. A thousand odors of cooking food came forth to the street. The building quivered and creaked from the weight of humanity stamping about in its bowels.\nA small ragged girl dragged a red, bawling infant along the crowded ways. He was hanging back, baby-like, bracing his wrinkled, bare legs.\nThe little girl cried out: \"Ah, Tommie, come ahn. Dere's Jimmie and fader. Don't be a-pullin' me back.\"\nShe jerked the baby's arm impatiently. He fell on his face, roaring. With a second jerk she pulled him to his feet, and they went on. With the obstinacy of his order, he protested against being dragged in a chosen direction. He made heroic endeavors to keep on his legs, denounce his sister and consume a bit of orange peeling which he chewed between the times of his infantile orations.\nAs the sullen-eyed man, followed by the blood-covered boy, drew near, the little girl burst into reproachful cries. \"Ah, Jimmie, youse bin fightin' agin.\"\nThe urchin swelled disdainfully.\n\"Ah, what deh hell, Mag. See?\"\nThe little girl upbraided him, \"Youse allus fightin', Jimmie, an' yeh knows it puts mudder out when yehs come home half dead, an' it's like we'll all get a poundin'.\"\nShe began to weep. The babe threw back his head and roared at his prospects.\n\"Ah, what deh hell!\" cried Jimmie. \"Shut up er I'll smack yer mout'. See?\"\nAs his sister continued her lamentations, he suddenly swore and struck her. The little girl reeled and, recovering herself, burst into tears and quaveringly cursed him. As she slowly retreated her brother advanced dealing her cuffs. The father heard and turned about.\n\"Stop that, Jim, d'yeh hear? Leave yer sister alone on the street. It's like I can never beat any sense into yer damned wooden head.\"\nThe urchin raised his voice in defiance to his parent and continued his attacks. The babe bawled tremendously, protesting with great violence. During his sister's hasty manoeuvres, he was dragged by the arm.\nFinally the procession plunged into one of the gruesome doorways. They crawled up dark stairways and along cold, gloomy halls. At last the father pushed open a door and they entered a lighted room in which a large woman was rampant.\nShe stopped in a career from a seething stove to a pan-covered table. As the father and children filed in she peered at them.\n\"Eh, what? Been fightin' agin, by Gawd!\" She threw herself upon Jimmie. The urchin tried to dart behind the others and in the scuffle the babe, Tommie, was knocked down. He protested with his usual vehemence, because they had bruised his tender shins against a table leg.\nThe mother's massive shoulders heaved with anger. Grasping the urchin by the neck and shoulder she shook him until he rattled. She dragged him to an unholy sink, and, soaking a rag in water, began to scrub his lacerated face with it. Jimmie screamed in pain and tried to twist his shoulders out of the clasp of the huge arms.\nThe babe sat on the floor watching the scene, his face in contortions like that of a woman at a tragedy. The father, with a newly-ladened pipe in his mouth, crouched on a backless chair near the stove. Jimmie's cries annoyed him. He turned about and bellowed at his wife:\n\"Let the damned kid alone for a minute, will yeh, Mary? Yer allus poundin' 'im. When I come nights I can't git no rest 'cause yer allus poundin' a kid. Let up, d'yeh hear? Don't be allus poundin' a kid.\"\nThe woman's operations on the urchin instantly increased in violence. At last she tossed him to a corner where he limply lay cursing and weeping.\nThe wife put her immense hands on her hips and with a chieftain-like stride approached her husband.\n\"Ho,\" she said, with a great grunt of contempt. \"An' what in the devil are you stickin' your nose for?\"\nThe babe crawled under the table and, turning, peered out cautiously. The ragged girl retreated and the urchin in the corner drew his legs carefully beneath him.\nThe man puffed his pipe calmly and put his great mudded boots on the back part of the stove.\n\"Go teh hell,\" he murmured, tranquilly.\nThe woman screamed and shook her fists before her husband's eyes. The rough yellow of her face and neck flared suddenly crimson. She began to howl.\nHe puffed imperturbably at his pipe for a time, but finally arose and began to look out at the window into the darkening chaos of back yards.\n\"You've been drinkin', Mary,\" he said. \"You'd better let up on the bot', ol' woman, or you'll git done.\"\n\"You're a liar. I ain't had a drop,\" she roared in reply.\nThey had a lurid altercation, in which they damned each other's souls with frequence.\nThe babe was staring out from under the table, his small face working in his excitement.\nThe ragged girl went stealthily over to the corner where the urchin lay.\n\"Are yehs hurted much, Jimmie?\" she whispered timidly.\n\"Not a damn bit! See?\" growled the little boy.\n\"Will I wash deh blood?\"\n\"Naw!\"\n\"Will I--\"\n\"When I catch dat Riley kid I'll break 'is face! Dat's right! See?\"\nHe turned his face to the wall as if resolved to grimly bide his time.\nIn the quarrel between husband and wife, the woman was victor. The man grabbed his hat and rushed from the room, apparently determined upon a vengeful drunk. She followed to the door and thundered at him as he made his way down stairs.\nShe returned and stirred up the room until her children were bobbing about like bubbles.\n\"Git outa deh way,\" she persistently bawled, waving feet with their dishevelled shoes near the heads of her children. She shrouded herself, puffing and snorting, in a cloud of steam at the stove, and eventually extracted a frying-pan full of potatoes that hissed.\nShe flourished it. \"Come teh yer suppers, now,\" she cried with sudden exasperation. \"Hurry up, now, er I'll help yeh!\"\nThe children scrambled hastily. With prodigious clatter they arranged themselves at table. The babe sat with his feet dangling high from a precarious infant chair and gorged his small stomach. Jimmie forced, with feverish rapidity, the grease-enveloped pieces between his wounded lips. Maggie, with side glances of fear of interruption, ate like a small pursued tigress.\nThe mother sat blinking at them. She delivered reproaches, swallowed potatoes and drank from a yellow-brown bottle. After a time her mood changed and she wept as she carried little Tommie into another room and laid him to sleep with his fists doubled in an old quilt of faded red and green grandeur. Then she came and moaned by the stove. She rocked to and fro upon a chair, shedding tears and crooning miserably to the two children about their \"poor mother\" and \"yer fader, damn 'is soul.\"\nThe little girl plodded between the table and the chair with a dish-pan on it. She tottered on her small legs beneath burdens of dishes.\nJimmie sat nursing his various wounds. He cast furtive glances at his mother. His practised eye perceived her gradually emerge from a muddled mist of sentiment until her brain burned in drunken heat. He sat breathless.\nMaggie broke a plate.\nThe mother started to her feet as if propelled.\n\"Good Gawd,\" she howled. Her eyes glittered on her child with sudden hatred. The fervent red of her face turned almost to purple. The little boy ran to the halls, shrieking like a monk in an earthquake.\nHe floundered about in darkness until he found the stairs. He stumbled, panic-stricken, to the next floor. An old woman opened a door. A light behind her threw a flare on the urchin's quivering face.\n\"Eh, Gawd, child, what is it dis time? Is yer fader beatin' yer mudder, or yer mudder beatin' yer fader?\"\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 490 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"

The narrator describes the slum buildings, the chaotic streets filled with children playing and fighting, and the adults going about their daily lives.\n\nA small girl named Maggie is dragging her younger brother Tommie along the street, trying to hurry him along. Tommie is resisting, falling down and crying, but Maggie impatiently pulls him up and continues. They are approached by Maggie's brother Jimmie and their father, who seems sullen and disheveled.\n\nMaggie immediately starts scolding Jimmie for fighting again, concerned about their mother's reaction. Jimmie dismisses her worries and the two siblings get into an argument, which escalates into Jimmie hitting Maggie. Their father intervenes, telling Jimmie to leave his sister alone, but Jimmie continues to defy him.\n\nThe family enters their tenement apartment, where their mother Mary is cooking. She immediately notices Jimmie's bruises and accuses him of fighting again. She grabs him and starts scrubbing his face with a wet rag, causing him to scream in pain. Tommie, watching from the floor, is upset by the commotion.\n\nThe father, unperturbed, sits near the stove, smoking his pipe. He tells Mary to stop punishing Jimmie, but she only becomes more violent. The father eventually gets up and goes to the window, telling Mary that she should cut back on drinking, hinting that she's been drinking heavily.\n\nMary angrily responds and the two start a heated argument, cursing each other. The father eventually storms out, presumably to go drinking himself, and Mary follows him to the door, shouting after him.\n\nOnce he's gone, Mary turns her attention to the children, shouting at them to get to supper. Maggie and Jimmie eat quickly, wary of their mother's mood. Tommie, the youngest, is put to bed by Mary, who then sits by the stove, drinking from a bottle and crying, talking to Maggie and Jimmie about their father's abandonment and her own misery.\n\nJimmie, who has been nursing his wounds from the earlier fight, watches his mother's behavior warily. He knows that when she starts drinking, she becomes unpredictable and violent. Maggie tries to help with the dishes, but accidentally breaks a plate, which sets off Mary's anger again. She starts yelling at Maggie and chases her out of the room.\n\nJimmie, fearing for himself, runs out of the apartment and up to the next floor, seeking refuge with a neighbor, an old woman who seems accustomed to the family's tumultuous behavior.\n\nThe passage paints a vivid picture of poverty, alcoholism, and domestic violence in urban America during this period. The characters are poorly educated and lack resources, living in squalid conditions and struggling to make ends meet. The parents are dysfunctional, with the father absent and alcoholic, and the mother volatile and abusive. The children are forced to navigate this hazardous environment, learning to fend for themselves and look out for their siblings.\n\nThe author's use of dialect and descriptive language immerses the reader in the setting, making the scene feel gritty and authentic. The portrayal of the tenement life is unflinching, highlighting the degradation and suffering of the urban poor.\n\nThis passage is from Stephen Crane's \"Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,\" a naturalist novel that explores the lives of the working-class in New York City. Crane's writing captures the harsh realities of poverty, the influence of alcohol, and the cyclical nature of abuse within families. The characters are products of their environment, with little opportunity for upward mobility or escape from their circumstances.\n\nIn this particular scene, the family dynamics are strained, with Mary's alcoholism and violence creating a volatile home life for the children. The father's absence and own drinking problem only exacerbate the situation. Maggie, as the older sister, takes on a caretaking role, trying to mediate between her siblings and mother, but ultimately unable to control the chaos.\n\nThe neighbor's mention of the father beating the mother or vice versa suggests that domestic violence is a regular occurrence in the family, and possibly in the neighborhood as a whole. The old woman's blas\u00e9 response to Jimmie's distress indicates that such disturbances are commonplace in the tenement building.\n\nOverall, this passage provides a stark depiction of life in the urban slums, highlighting the struggles and hardships faced by the working poor in the late 19th century. It serves as a commentary on societal issues such as poverty, alcoholism, and the breakdown of the family unit.\n\n**Word Count:** 490\nENDOUTPUT"
