        "content": "So I have this problem here: there's a bag with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, and I need to find the probability of drawing a red ball without looking. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is drawing a red ball, and the total outcomes are all the balls in the bag.\n\nLet me count the total number of balls. There are 4 red and 6 blue, so total balls = 4 + 6 = 10 balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls, which is 4.\n\nSo, probability of drawing a red ball (P(red)) = number of red balls / total number of balls = 4/10.\n\nI can simplify that fraction: 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal: 2/5 = 0.4.\n\nOr as a percentage: 0.4 \u00d7 100% = 40%.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/5, or 0.4, or 40%.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Probability should be a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means it's impossible and 1 means it's certain. Here, 0.4 is between 0 and 1, so that makes sense.\n\nAlso, another way to think about it is that for every 10 balls, 4 are red. So, if I draw one ball, there's a 4 in 10 chance it's red, which is the same as 40%.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use the formula for probability:\n\nP(event) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes.\n\nYes, that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people think about probability in terms of ratios. So, the ratio of red balls to total balls is 4:10, which simplifies to 2:5, which is consistent with the fraction I got earlier.\n\nI could also consider the probability of not drawing a red ball, which would be drawing a blue ball. There are 6 blue balls out of 10, so P(blue) = 6/10 = 3/5 = 0.6 = 60%.\n\nAnd since there are only red and blue balls, the probabilities should add up to 1.\n\nLet's check: P(red) + P(blue) = 0.4 + 0.6 = 1. Perfect, that makes sense.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is if the balls are drawn with replacement or without replacement. But in this problem, it's just one draw, so it doesn't matter.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"without looking,\" which probably just means it's a random draw, which is the usual assumption in probability problems like this.\n\nI should also consider whether the balls are identical except for their color. I assume they are, since it's just about color difference.\n\nIf there were other differences, it might affect the probability, but in this case, it's solely based on color.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with my answer of 4/10 or 2/5 or 0.4 or 40%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe someone might think that the balls are not equally likely to be drawn, but in standard probability problems like this, unless specified otherwise, we assume that each ball has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\nAlternatively, if the balls are different sizes or something, but again, without that information, we assume they're identical except for color.\n\nSo, I think 4/10 is the correct probability.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible outcomes. There are 10 balls, each one equally likely to be drawn.\n\nThe favorable outcomes are the 4 red balls.\n\nSo, probability is favorable divided by total, which is 4/10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red ball is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5, or 0.4, or 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
