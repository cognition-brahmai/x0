        "content": "So I've got this problem here: evaluate the triple integral of xyz over the region bounded by z = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 and z = 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. Alright, let's see. First things first, I need to understand the region we're dealing with.\n\nSo, we have two surfaces: z = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, which is a paraboloid opening upwards, and z = 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, which is another paraboloid but opening downwards. They intersect where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 2, because setting them equal gives x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 2. So, the region bounded by these two surfaces is like the space between these two paraboloids from z = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 up to z = 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, and projecting down to the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 2 in the xy-plane.\n\nNow, to set up the triple integral, I need to decide on the order of integration. Since the region is symmetric and involves circular symmetry, it might be a good idea to use cylindrical coordinates. In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8, and z = z. The Jacobian for the transformation is r, so the volume element dv becomes r dz dr d\u03b8.\n\nLet's rewrite the equations in cylindrical coordinates:\n\nz = r\u00b2 (from z = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nz = 4 - r\u00b2 (from z = 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)\n\nSo, for each (r, \u03b8), z ranges from r\u00b2 to 4 - r\u00b2. The radial distance r ranges from 0 to the radius where the surfaces intersect, which is sqrt(2), and \u03b8 ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nNow, the integrand is xyz. In cylindrical coordinates, that's (r cos\u03b8)(r sin\u03b8)z = r\u00b2 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 z.\n\nSo, the triple integral becomes:\n\n\u222b\u222b\u222b xyz dv = \u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] \u222b[0 to sqrt(2)] \u222b[r\u00b2 to 4 - r\u00b2] r\u00b2 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 z * r dz dr d\u03b8\n\nWait a minute, let's check that. The volume element is r dz dr d\u03b8, and the integrand is r\u00b2 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 z, so overall it should be r\u00b3 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 z dz dr d\u03b8.\n\nBut, looking at this, I notice that the integrand has a cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 term, which is an odd function in \u03b8. Specifically, cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 is an odd function because cos(-\u03b8) sin(-\u03b8) = (-cos\u03b8)(-sin\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8, but wait, that's actually even, because cos(-\u03b8) sin(-\u03b8) = (-cos\u03b8)(-sin\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8, which is the same as cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8. No, wait, that's incorrect. cos(-\u03b8) sin(-\u03b8) = (-cos\u03b8)(-sin\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8, which is actually even, because it's symmetric about \u03b8 = 0.\n\nWait, no. cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 is actually odd because sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u03b8 and cos(-\u03b8) = cos\u03b8, so cos(-\u03b8) sin(-\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 (-sin\u03b8) = -cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8. So, it's odd.\n\nTherefore, the integrand r\u00b3 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 z is odd in \u03b8.\n\nNow, since the limits of \u03b8 are from 0 to 2\u03c0, and the integrand is odd in \u03b8, the integral over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 should be zero.\n\nWait, but cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 is odd, and z is even in \u03b8, since z = z(r,\u03b8) = z(r), independent of \u03b8. Wait, no, z depends on r, which depends on \u03b8 and r, but in this case, z is symmetric in \u03b8.\n\nActually, z is independent of \u03b8 in cylindrical coordinates, since z = z(r). So, z is even in \u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the product r\u00b3 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 z is odd in \u03b8.\n\nTherefore, integrating an odd function over a symmetric interval should give zero.\n\nSo, the entire integral should be zero.\n\nWait, but let's confirm this.\n\nThe integral is:\n\n\u222b[0 to 2\u03c0] \u222b[0 to sqrt(2)] \u222b[r\u00b2 to 4 - r\u00b2] r\u00b3 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 z dz dr d\u03b8\n\nSince cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 is odd in \u03b8, and the limits of \u03b8 are from 0 to 2\u03c0, which is symmetric about \u03b8 = \u03c0, the integral over \u03b8 should be zero.\n\nTherefore, the whole integral is zero.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any reason why this wouldn't hold.\n\nIs there any symmetry breaking here? Does the region or the integrand have any preferences for certain directions?\n\nWell, the region is symmetric under rotation about the z-axis, and the integrand xyz changes sign under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + \u03c0, because x \u2192 -x and y \u2192 -y, so xyz \u2192 (-x)(-y)z = xyz, but wait, no.\n\nWait, under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + \u03c0, x \u2192 -x and y \u2192 -y, so xyz \u2192 (-x)(-y)z = xy z, so it's actually invariant under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + \u03c0.\n\nBut anyway, given that cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 is odd in \u03b8, and the integral is over a full period, the integral should be zero.\n\nTherefore, the triple integral evaluates to zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
