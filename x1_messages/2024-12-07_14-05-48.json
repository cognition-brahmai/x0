        "content": "So the company currently produces 5,000 units per day and sells each unit for $20. They're thinking about increasing their production by 10% and want to know how much extra revenue that would bring in.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what a 10% increase in production would be. If they produce 5,000 units daily, then 10% of that is:\n\n5,000 units * 0.10 = 500 units\n\nSo, they would be producing an additional 500 units per day.\n\nNext, since they sell each unit for $20, the additional revenue from these extra units would be:\n\n500 units * $20/unit = $10,000\n\nTherefore, by increasing production by 10%, the company would generate an additional $10,000 in revenue per day.\n\nBut wait, I should consider whether selling these extra units is straightforward. Assuming that they can sell all the additional units at the same price without any issues, the calculation holds. However, in reality, there might be constraints such as market demand, production capacity, or logistical challenges that could affect their ability to sell the extra units.\n\nAlso, increasing production by 10% might require additional resources or longer working hours, which could increase costs. But since the question only asks for additional revenue and not profit, I don't need to factor in the costs here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the price per unit remains constant. If increasing production leads to a surplus in the market, it might put downward pressure on prices. But again, based on the information provided, it seems that they can sell the extra units at the same price.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the additional revenue would be $10,000 per day if they increase production by 10%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10000} \\]"
