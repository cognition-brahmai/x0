        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a tree grows at an average rate of 2.5 inches per month, and I need to find out how tall it will be after 6 years, starting from a height of 10 inches. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked.\n\nSo, the tree grows 2.5 inches every month, and I need to calculate its height after 6 years. I know that there are 12 months in a year, so over 6 years, that would be 6 times 12, which is 72 months. So, the tree grows for 72 months.\n\nNow, if it grows 2.5 inches each month for 72 months, I can find the total growth by multiplying the growth rate per month by the number of months. That should give me the total growth over the 6 years.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal growth = growth rate per month \u00d7 number of months\n\nSo, total growth = 2.5 inches/month \u00d7 72 months\n\nWhen I multiply those, the \"months\" unit cancels out, leaving me with inches, which makes sense for height.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n2.5 \u00d7 72\n\nWell, 2.5 is the same as 2 + 0.5, so 2 \u00d7 72 is 144, and 0.5 \u00d7 72 is 36. Adding those together, 144 + 36 equals 180 inches.\n\nSo, the tree grows 180 inches over 6 years.\n\nBut wait, the tree starts at a height of 10 inches. So, to find the total height after 6 years, I need to add the initial height to the total growth.\n\nTotal height = initial height + total growth\n\nSo, total height = 10 inches + 180 inches = 190 inches\n\nAlright, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the tree's height? The problem doesn't mention any seasonal variations or anything like that, so I'll assume the growth rate is constant throughout the year.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my units are consistent. The growth rate is given in inches per month, and the initial height is in inches, and I'm asked for the height in inches, so everything matches.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the tree grows at the beginning or end of each month, but since the growth rate is average, it probably doesn't matter for this calculation.\n\nSo, I think 190 inches is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication.\n\n2.5 \u00d7 72:\n\n2.5 is half of 5, so 5 \u00d7 72 is 360, and half of that is 180. Yes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen adding the initial 10 inches brings it to 190 inches.\n\nI think that's it. The tree will be 190 inches tall after 6 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
