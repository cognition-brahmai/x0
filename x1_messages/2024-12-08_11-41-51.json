Maybe it's someone else. Let me think differently. Perhaps it's someone less famous in telecommunications but more known for pasta. Wait, maybe it's not directly related to telecommunications. Maybe it's a different field altogether. Hmm. I need to find an Italian inventor whose last name matches a type of pasta. Let me list some common Italian pastas: spaghetti, fettuccine, lasagna, ravioli, etc. Now, are any of these associated with inventors?\n\nLet's consider Lasagna. Is there an inventor with the last name Lasagna? I don't think so. How about Spaghetti? Does anyone famous with that last name come to mind? Not really. Ravioli? Same here. Maybe it's a less common pasta name. Let me think of less common pastas: gnocchi, farfalle, penne, etc. Again, no inventors come to mind.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the inventor isn't directly related to telecommunications. Maybe it's in a different field altogether, and the connection is just the last name coinciding with a pasta name. For example, if someone invented something and their last name is Spaghetti, but that seems unlikely. Perhaps it's more about the last name sounding like a pasta, but not actually being a type of pasta.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inventor's last name is similar to a pasta name. For example, Maccheroni and Marconi both sound similar, and Marconi is a famous Italian inventor known for his work in radio communication. Maybe that's it. Despite my initial thought, perhaps Marconi is the answer, and Maccheroni is a type of pasta, even though I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nLet me verify. Guglielmo Marconi is indeed a famous Italian inventor known for his pioneering work in long-distance radio transmission and is often credited with the invention of radio. Now, is Maccheroni a type of pasta? Yes, Maccheroni is another term for pasta, similar to macaroni in English. So, Marconi shares his last name with a type of pasta, maccheroni.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Guglielmo Marconi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Guglielmo Marconi}} \\]"
