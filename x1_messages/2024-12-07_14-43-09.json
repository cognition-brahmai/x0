Here's a Python program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome without using any built-in string manipulation functions:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    # Remove any non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase\n    cleaned = ''\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isalnum():\n            cleaned += char.lower()\n    \n    # Check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse\n    length = len(cleaned)\n    for i in range(length // 2):\n        if cleaned[i] != cleaned[length - i - 1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Test the function\nstring = input(\"Enter a string: \")\nif is_palindrome(string):\n    print(\"It's a palindrome!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"It's not a palindrome.\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function called `is_palindrome` that takes a string `s` as input. \n\nFirst, we remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the string and convert it to lowercase. This is done by iterating over each character in the string and checking if it is alphanumeric using the `isalnum()` method. If it is, we append its lowercase version to a new string called `cleaned`.\n\nNext, we check if the `cleaned` string is equal to its reverse. To do this, we iterate over the first half of the string (using integer division `//` to handle odd lengths correctly) and compare each character at position `i` with the character at position `length - i - 1`, where `length` is the length of the `cleaned` string. If any pair of characters doesn't match, we return `False` immediately, indicating that it's not a palindrome. If all pairs match, we return `True`.\n\nFinally, we prompt the user to enter a string, call the `is_palindrome` function with the input string, and print the appropriate message based on the returned boolean value.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the string only contains alphanumeric characters and ignores any other characters, such as spaces or punctuation marks. If you want to consider those characters as well, you can modify the condition inside the first loop accordingly."
