In Manila, we're expecting some remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump at the ASEAN Summit later this hour. The president just finished meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, his host. And thousands of people respond to a Christmas wish from a nine-year- old boy dying of cancer, we'll have more on that later. Thank you for joining us, everyone. I'm Cyril Vanier live from the CNN NEWSROOM here in Atlanta. The rescuers in Iraq and Iran are searching for people under the rubble after a deadly earthquake rocked the border between the two countries. The 7.3 magnitude quake hit about 30 kilometers from the Iraqi city of Halabja. Iranian officials say that at least 164 people have been killed on their side of the border with more than 1500 injured. And in Iraq itself at least four people have died, dozens more were injured, and that death toll has already risen from the last hour and still expected to rise, unfortunately. People felt the quake throughout Iraq like at this Baghdad grocery store. New agencies in Pakistan, in Lebanon, Kuwait, and Turkey, also reported feeling tremors. Let's turn to Ivan Cabrera who joins us from the CNN Weather Center. You've been monitoring developments, what's going on? IVAN CABRERA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: More aftershocks and they continue, and some of them are particularly strong too which in and of it selves are earthquake center, pretty strong VANIER: Yes. The major challenge on both sides of the Iran-Iraq border. Ivan Cabrera, I know you're going to be following this for us. We'll speak to you throughout the morning. Thank you very much. Now U.S. President Donald Trump has just met with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, his host at a summit of Southeast Asian leaders in Manila. The president praised his host before their meeting, but when asked by a journalist whether he would bring up the subject of human rights, Mr. Trump didn't respond to the question. Let's bring in CNN's Matt Rivers in the Philippine capital, Manila. And in Hong Kong, also we'll be speaking Glenn Shive of the Hong Kong- American Center. Matt, to you first, Mr. Trump and Mr. Duterte have met. Their first proper sit-down meeting, what can you tell us about their relationship? MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, their relationship according to the White House is one of a warm rapport, that's how a senior White House official described their relationship to reporters before President Trump went on this trip. And from the Philippines side, President Duterte has been a big fan of President Trump -- he's had nothing, really, but praise for the U.S. leader in a way that, frankly, he had the exact kind of opposite feelings towards Barack Obama. The outcome of this meeting, though, will have a lot to do with their relationship moving forward, because we're all wondering how forcefully, if at all, Donald Trump brings up the issue of human rights violations committed by the Duterte administration, according to human rights groups from around the world during this ongoing crackdown against drugs here in the country. The White House says that Donald Trump was planning on bringing up that issue with the Philippine president, but we're not sure how forcefully he did it, whether he condemned the actions here or whether he would say anything about it publicly moving forward. We haven't had details about exactly what was discussed in that bilateral meeting. He did try, reporters did try with the traveling VANIER: All right. What is Mr. Trump, the U.S. President, actually trying to get up his day in the Philippines? We know he didn't come here to talk about human rights, he said before: he doesn't like to lecture his host. So, what is the -- what's he looking for the in The Philippines? RIVERS: Yes, this is all about trade, frankly. And what Donald Trump has called unfair trade deals with countries not only here at the ASEAN Summit but also other countries like China, and Japan and South Korea, that's really been the overall theme of that. And, of course, North Korea, those would be the two big topics on every single stop the president has made, and that doesn't change here in Manila. But, you know, more specifically talking about this region, what the president will likely try to do is make sure that the American economic influence that has been present in this part of the world for a very long time now remains robust even though the president under his leadership has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as one of his first moves as president. That has many people questioning whether countries like China can step up and fill a void of economic influence. And so, the president certainly trying to make sure that the American trade imprint is fixed, as he would put it because it's unfair trade deals as he often says. But also, that the American economic influence remains strong in Southeast Asia. VANIER: Matt Rivers reporting live from Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Let me turn to Glenn Shive. Glenn, what leverage does the U.S. President have when he's talking to the East Asian countries and when it comes to trade and he tells them he wants fairer trade deals? What's his leverage there? GLENN SHIVE, DIRECTOR AND CEO, HONG KONG AMERICA CENTER: Well, the American economy is huge and the access to the American markets is so important to the growth of all these Asian countries. And when there's a recession, it's the American economy that historically has pulled other countries out of recession. And so, it's very important -- our economic clout is what they want, and so he has a chance to say, well, you can have access to our markets if we have reciprocal access to yours. So, that's, I think, the main clout. VANIER: The regional countries are going ahead with a regional trade deal, the TPP. SHIVE: Yes. VANIER: That's the one that Obama administration worked on that Trump pulled the U.S. out of when he came in power. SHIVE: Right. VANIER: But the regional countries are going ahead without the United States. So, how can the United States insert itself as far as trade is concerned in this region? SHIVE: Well, it's playing another game, and it's yet to be seen if this is going to work. But a lot of the other countries that came together around TPP was through U.S. leadership, and in a sense that access to the American market is something that everybody wanted as part of the TPP. Now, without U.S. in the mix, can it still work? I think, probably, yes. But the danger is that America is on the outside looking in. And a lot of these agreements is not just about tariffs, it's about barriers behind the border that, I mean, gaining access to these markets. And that's a big structural problem in China, in other parts of Asia, and it's unclear that Trump has made a lot of headways on this trip. He's talking bilateral trade agreements but if you're big America and the smaller country, one-on-one, you know, it's to your disadvantage probably to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement. Even the Korean- U.S. Agreement -- U.S. says it wants to negotiate. So, I mean, we're in an uncertain time with NAFTA, for example. And so, it's very important that the Trump administration come clear with what it wants, what style of the agreement, what style of the agreement, what's included? Are we talking about just tariffs? Are we talking about environmental and labor issues? Are we talking about investment treaties? Are we talking about services? That's the new growth area that trade agreements need to -- need to define. And we have an enormous power of our service economy, and it can play out very important. But actually, to be outside the TPP is actually not a good position to be in, and I think he was talking at odds with his audience in denying and now, again, at the ASEAN meeting in Manila. VANIER: Tell me about the wider strategy in the region for Mr. Trump. We heard a lot about the Indo-Pacific strategy going into this trip, what is that and is it working, or can it work? SHIVE: It's a good question. And, you know, he criticized Obama for talking about pivot and sort of a lot of language without much substance. And TPP was going to be the economic substance of that. Indo-Pacific involves India, but India is really not even there. I think Asia is the core term for these 21 countries that are meeting in Vietnam and again in Manila, that they're not sure what does it mean that U.S. is bringing India in and is this a counterpoint to China? You know, so, there's -- again, he talks ahead of laying out the details or the concrete actions that he's preparing to take. And I think a lot of these leaders -- while they appreciate the one-on-one rapport with him, meeting him finally, but they're very concerned that his changeability and, in fact, that his language is out ahead of his actions. And they just say we got to wait and see what they actually do. He has half the people he needs on board to do the follow-up work; he hasn't hired them on yet. So, he's in a sense out ahead of himself a bit. And so, people are scratching their heads and saying, you know, what's this going to mean. But Indo-Pacific, it might go down as a term once used, and then turned away. It's -- are we talking about language that indicates that America is going to step back from ASEAN, and it's Japan, Australia, India -- you know, that's a broad circle. Is this a strategic relationship? Are we talking an economic relationship? It's unclear. And I think for the ASEAN people they're saying we're not with that. The integration with India with the rest of Asia -- India, in the sense what -- like that, but I don't -- we don't see where that's playing out. VANIER: Glenn Shive of the Hong Kong America Center, good to have you back on the show. Thank you very much. SHIVE: Pleasure. VANIER: During President Trump's stop in Vietnam reporters asked him whether he discussed election meddling with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two chatted briefly on the sidelines of the APEC Summit -- that was on Friday. Mr. Trump said that he thought Russian President Vladimir Putin was sincere in his denial of Russian meddling in the U.S. election. President Trump, however, did not specifically say that Russia was behind the hacks. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election. As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies, I've worked with them very strongly. They weren't 17 as was previously reported, there was actually four. But they were saying there was 17, there were actually four. But as currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies. VANIER: Well, two former intelligence chiefs talked with CNN's Jake Tapper about the fact that a U.S. president has to clarify that he trusts his own intelligence services over a foreign leader. JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: He said, Putin believes what he believes, and, you know, I side with our intelligence agencies, but it was vague. Why do think he does that? JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: I don't know why the ambiguity about this because the threat posed by Russia as John just said is a manifest, and obvious, and has been for a long time. Putin is committed to undermining our system, our democracy, and our whole process. And to try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and, in fact, poses a peril to this country. TAPPER: What threat? What peril does it pose to the country? CLAPPER: Well, for one, as we've in the evidence that's come out since the publication of our intelligence community assessment on January, it further reinforces the depth and magnitude in scope and the aggressiveness of the Russian interference to include their very astute use of social media. Apart from that, something we don't think about much is the fact the Russians are embarked on a very aggressive modernization of their strategic nuclear forces to include a very capable and scary counter space program. They only have one adversary in mind when they do this. And oh, by the way, the Russians are an abject violation of the INF Treaty, the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. So, the Russians do not harbor good intentions towards the United States, and there shouldn't be any illusions or any ambiguity about that. And our president, the president, fosters that ambiguity. TAPPER: What message do you think President Trump is sending to Vladimir Putin right now in terms of Russia's continued attempts to interfere in elections in Europe, and potentially in the United States again? CLAPPER: Well, I think what he doing is, he's saying to Vladimir Putin we need to put this behind us because they're important -- there's important work to be done. I agree we need to be able to find a way to improve relations between Moscow and Washington. But I think that by not confronting the issue directly and not acknowledging to Putin that we know that you're responsible for this, I think he's giving Putin a pass, and I think it demonstrates to Mr. Putin that Donald Trump can be played by foreign leaders who are going to appeal to his ego and to try to play upon his insecurities -- which is very, very worrisome from a national security standpoint.

President Trump meets with Philippine President Duterte at ASEAN Summit, discussing trade and human rights issues. Former intelligence chiefs express concern over Trump's stance on Russian election interference.\n\n## Final Solution\n### Summary\n\n- **Earthquake in Iran and Iraq:** A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck the border region between Iran and Iraq, resulting in over 150 deaths and more than 1,500 injuries. Rescuers are searching for survivors under the rubble, and the death toll is expected to rise.\n\n- **ASEAN Summit in Manila:** U.S. President Donald Trump met with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at the ASEAN Summit. The meeting focused on trade and human rights issues, with Trump emphasizing the importance of fair trade deals and the U.S. economic influence in the region.\n\n- **Trade and Economic Influence:** Trump seeks to negotiate bilateral trade agreements to ensure reciprocal market access, despite pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Regional countries are moving forward with the TPP without the U.S., raising questions about American economic clout in the area.\n\n- **Indo-Pacific Strategy:** Trump's Indo-Pacific strategy, which includes India, is seen as unclear and potentially isolating ASEAN countries. Critics argue that without concrete actions, the strategy lacks substance and may not effectively counter China's influence.\n\n- **Russian Election Interference:** Trump's comments on Russian election interference have drawn criticism from former intelligence chiefs. They express concern that Trump's ambiguity fosters a dangerous perception and may embolden further interference in democratic processes.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Humanitarian Crisis:** The earthquake in Iran and Iraq has caused significant loss of life and injuries, with rescue operations ongoing. The high magnitude of the quake and its proximity to populated areas have exacerbated the damage.\n\n- **U.S. Foreign Policy in Asia:** Trump's focus on bilateral trade agreements reflects his administration's preference for deal-making over multilateral frameworks. However, this approach may limit U.S. influence if regional countries proceed with agreements excluding American participation.\n\n- **Strategic Uncertainty:** The Indo-Pacific strategy's inclusion of India raises questions about its alignment with ASEAN interests. Without clear definitions and actions, the strategy may not achieve its intended goals of countering Chinese influence and strengthening U.S. ties in the region.\n\n- **National Security Concerns:** The ambiguity in Trump's stance on Russian interference in U.S. elections is a cause for concern among former intelligence officials. They worry that this could undermine national security and embolden further hostile actions from adversarial nations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe situation in Iran and Iraq following the earthquake requires immediate humanitarian assistance and continued rescue efforts. In the geopolitical sphere, President Trump's efforts to renegotiate trade deals and assert U.S. influence in Asia face challenges, particularly in light of regional developments like the TPP. Additionally, concerns over the administration's approach to national security issues, such as Russian interference, highlight potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to summarize the given input, which consists of a news report covering multiple topics, into around 40 words. \n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Key Points:** Extract the main points from each section of the input.\n2. **Condense Information:** Summarize each key point briefly.\n3. **Combine Summaries:** Merge these condensed points into a single, coherent summary.\n4. **Ensure Brevity:** Make sure the final summary is approximately 40 words.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```plaintext\nAt least 1500 people injured and over 150 killed in Iran after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake hits the border with Iraq.
