For each step in your plan, provide an associated evidence value, which will be the output of a function given an input string that could be the user's query, prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that lets users perform searches on DuckDuckGo. Useful for identifying potential sources of answers to the user's question.\nWebCrawler[input]: Takes one or more URLs from the input string (separated by newlines) and outputs the plaintext contents of those pages.\nURLPicker[input]: Extracts URLs from plaintext and provides a plaintext, newline-separated list of URLs.\nInfoBot[input]: A question-answering language model. Its input should be a textual question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [initial action based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action, informed by the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [following function to call and its input parameter, potentially referring back to earlier evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: holding the ultimate answer]\n\nQuestion: Who was Nikola Tesla and what were his most significant inventions?"
