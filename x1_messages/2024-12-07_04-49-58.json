        "content": "Let's see. John has 90 comic books, and he wants to distribute them among his four friends. He's giving 10% to the first friend, 20% to the second, 30% to the third, and the rest to the fourth friend. I need to figure out how many comic books each friend gets.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate 10% of 90 for the first friend.\n\n10% of 90 is calculated as (10/100) * 90 = 9.\n\nSo, the first friend gets 9 comic books.\n\nNext, for the second friend, who gets 20%:\n\n20% of 90 is (20/100) * 90 = 18.\n\nSo, the second friend gets 18 comic books.\n\nNow, the third friend gets 30%:\n\n30% of 90 is (30/100) * 90 = 27.\n\nSo, the third friend gets 27 comic books.\n\nNow, to find out how many comic books the fourth friend gets, I need to subtract the total given to the first three friends from the total collection.\n\nTotal given to first three friends is 9 + 18 + 27 = 54.\n\nSo, the fourth friend gets 90 - 54 = 36 comic books.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\nTotal percentage given to first three friends is 10% + 20% + 30% = 60%.\n\nSo, the fourth friend gets 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\n40% of 90 is (40/100) * 90 = 36.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n- First friend: 9 comic books\n\n- Second friend: 18 comic books\n\n- Third friend: 27 comic books\n\n- Fourth friend: 36 comic books\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFirst friend: 9 comic books\n\nSecond friend: 18 comic books\n\nThird friend: 27 comic books\n\nFourth friend: 36 comic books\n"
