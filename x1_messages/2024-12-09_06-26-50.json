        "content": "So, if a car's gas tank holds 16 gallons and it gets an average of 25 miles per gallon, how far can it travel on a full tank? Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The car has a full tank of gas, which is 16 gallons, and it can go 25 miles for each gallon. So, to find out how far it can travel on a full tank, I probably need to multiply the number of gallons by the miles per gallon.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDistance = gallons \u00d7 miles per gallon\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nDistance = 16 gallons \u00d7 25 miles/gallon\n\nNow, when I multiply gallons by miles per gallon, the gallons unit cancels out, and I'm left with miles.\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n16 \u00d7 25 = ?\n\nWell, 10 \u00d7 25 is 250, and 6 \u00d7 25 is 150, so total is 250 + 150 = 400 miles.\n\nSo, the car can travel 400 miles on a full tank of gas.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Is there any other factor that might affect the distance traveled?\n\nHmm, maybe the driving conditions, like city or highway driving, or the speed at which the car is driven, or even the weather conditions. But the problem says it gets an average of 25 miles per gallon, so I think it's safe to assume that's already taking into account any average conditions.\n\nAlso, the size of the gas tank is given as 16 gallons, so I don't think there's any need to consider additional factors.\n\nLet me double-check my multiplication: 16 \u00d7 25.\n\n16 \u00d7 20 = 320\n\n16 \u00d7 5 = 80\n\nTotal = 320 + 80 = 400 miles.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 25 miles per gallon, so for 16 gallons, it's 25 \u00d7 16.\n\nOr, 25 \u00d7 16 is the same as 25 \u00d7 (10 + 6) = 250 + 150 = 400 miles.\n\nSame answer.\n\nSo, the car can travel 400 miles on a full tank of gas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
