        "content": "Let's see. There are five friends who went out for dinner and the total bill was $125. They decided to split the bill evenly, but one friend forgot their wallet, so only four friends are paying. I need to figure out how much each of these four friends needs to contribute.\n\nFirst, if there were no issues, and all five friends were paying equally, each would pay the total bill divided by five. So, $125 divided by 5 is $25 each. But since one friend forgot their wallet, only four friends are paying. So, the total bill now needs to be divided among four people instead of five.\n\nSo, $125 divided by 4. Let me do the math: 125 divided by 4 is 31.25. So, each of the four friends needs to pay $31.25.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If four friends are paying $31.25 each, then 4 times $31.25 should equal the total bill of $125.\n\nLet's multiply: 4 times 30 is 120, and 4 times 1.25 is 5, so 120 plus 5 is indeed $125. So, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total bill is $125, and one friend isn't paying, so the other four friends have to cover the entire bill. So, each of the four pays an equal share of the $125.\n\nSo, yes, $31.25 each.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31.25} \\]"
