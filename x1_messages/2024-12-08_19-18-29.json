        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces widgets at a rate of 500 per hour. The quality control department checks every 50th widget, and out of those checked, 98% pass inspection. We need to find out how many defective widgets are produced in an 8-hour shift.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many widgets are produced in total during an 8-hour shift. Since the factory produces 500 widgets per hour, over 8 hours that would be:\n\n500 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 4,000 widgets\n\nSo, 4,000 widgets are produced in total during the shift.\n\nNext, the quality control checks every 50th widget. To find out how many widgets are checked, I can divide the total number of widgets by 50:\n\n4,000 widgets \u00f7 50 = 80 widgets checked\n\nOut of these 80 widgets that are checked, 98% pass inspection. That means 2% are defective, right? Because 100% - 98% = 2%.\n\nSo, the number of defective widgets detected by quality control would be:\n\n80 widgets checked \u00d7 2% = 1.6 widgets\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a widget, maybe I need to round that to the nearest whole number. 1.6 is closer to 2, so perhaps 2 defective widgets are found.\n\nHowever, this seems a bit simplistic. The quality control only checks every 50th widget, so maybe not every defective widget is caught. But the problem says that 98% of the checked widgets pass, which implies that 2% are defective among those checked. But are there more defective widgets that weren't checked?\n\nWait a minute. The quality control only checks every 50th widget, so they're checking a sample of the total production. If they find that 2% of the checked widgets are defective, we might assume that approximately 2% of the total production is defective, assuming the sample is representative.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total number of defective widgets in the entire production would be:\n\n4,000 widgets \u00d7 2% = 80 defective widgets\n\nThat seems more in line with what we might expect. But I need to make sure that this assumption is valid. Is it reasonable to assume that the sample of every 50th widget is representative of the entire production?\n\nWell, in quality control, sampling every nth item is a common practice, and if the production process is consistent, the sample should be representative. So, I think it's fair to assume that the defect rate found in the sample applies to the entire production run.\n\nTherefore, the number of defective widgets produced in the 8-hour shift would be approximately 80.\n\nBut let's double-check this approach. Another way to look at it is to consider that only every 50th widget is checked, and out of those, 2% are defective. If we assume that the defect rate is uniform across the entire production, then the total number of defective widgets should be the same as if we applied the defect rate to the entire production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the defect rate only applies to the checked widgets, and we don't know about the others. But that seems unlikely, as quality control assumes that the sample reflects the overall quality.\n\nAnother consideration: if only every 50th widget is checked, and 2% of those are defective, maybe there are more defective widgets in the unchecked ones. But without additional information, it's reasonable to assume that the defect rate is consistent across all widgets.\n\nGiven that, I think the best estimate is that 2% of the total production is defective, leading to 80 defective widgets in the 8-hour shift.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated that 4,000 widgets \u00d7 2% = 80 defective widgets. But when I considered the number of checked widgets, it was 80 checked, with 2% defective, meaning 1.6 defective widgets found. So, if 1.6 defective widgets are found in the 80 checked, but the total production is 4,000, then the defect rate is indeed 1.6 / 4,000, which is 0.04%, but that doesn't match the earlier assumption.\n\nHmm, I must have messed up somewhere. Let's try to clarify.\n\nIf 80 widgets are checked, and 2% are defective, then the number of defective widgets found is 1.6, which we can round to 2.\n\nBut these 80 checked widgets are representative of the entire production, so the defect rate in the sample should reflect the defect rate in the total production.\n\nTherefore, if 2% of the checked widgets are defective, we can estimate that 2% of the total production is defective.\n\nSo, 4,000 total widgets \u00d7 2% = 80 defective widgets.\n\nAlternatively, looking at it another way: the defect rate is 2% based on the sample, so we apply that rate to the entire production.\n\nTherefore, the number of defective widgets in the 8-hour shift is approximately 80.\n\nI think that's the most reasonable conclusion based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
