        "content": "So the train is going from Town A to Town B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and the whole journey takes 6 hours. That means the total distance between Town A and Town B is speed multiplied by time, right? So that's 60 miles per hour times 6 hours, which equals 360 miles.\n\nNow, Station X is located exactly halfway between Town A and Town B. So, halfway would mean it's 180 miles from Town A to Station X, since 360 miles divided by 2 is 180 miles.\n\nTo find out how long it takes to go from Town A to Station X, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time from Town A to Station X is 180 miles divided by 60 miles per hour, which equals 3 hours.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. If the whole trip is 360 miles and takes 6 hours, then half the distance should take half the time, assuming constant speed. Half of 6 hours is indeed 3 hours, so that makes sense.\n\nHowever, the question mentions that the train has to stop at Station X due to some technical issues. But it doesn't specify how long it stops there or if the speed changes after the stop. Since it doesn't provide details about the stop, I think we can assume that the stopping time is negligible or not factored into the travel time, and the speed remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the time to travel from Town A to Station X should be 3 hours.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Let's think differently. Perhaps the technical issues affect the speed or the travel time. But the question says the train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour and takes exactly 6 hours for the whole journey. Then, it has to stop at Station X, which is halfway, but it doesn't say that the speed changes or that the total time changes due to the stop.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the time from Town A to Station X should be half the total time, which is 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it using distance and speed again. Distance from Town A to Station X is 180 miles, speed is 60 miles per hour, so time is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Unless there's additional information or constraints that I'm missing, the answer should be 3 hours.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the technical issues cause a delay, and I need to factor in that delay to the travel time. But the question doesn't specify how long the train stops at Station X due to technical issues. Since it's not provided, I can't account for any additional time.\n\nIn such cases, it's best to assume that the stopping time is negligible or not included in the travel time. Therefore, the time from Town A to Station X remains 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if the technical issues affect the speed between Town A and Station X, but the question states that the train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, so I think the speed remains unchanged.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key points are:\n\n- Constant speed of 60 mph\n\n- Total time for Town A to Town B is 6 hours\n\n- Station X is halfway between Town A and Town B\n\nTherefore, distance from Town A to Station X is half of the total distance, and time is half of the total time, which is 3 hours.\n\nSo, the answer should be 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
