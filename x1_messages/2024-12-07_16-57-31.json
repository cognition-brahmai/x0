        "content": "To address the user's request to send an email, I need to select the appropriate function from the available options and configure it with the right parameters. The user wants to send an email to a specific recipient with a particular subject and body. Looking at the available functions, there is an \"email_send\" function that matches this requirement.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the function to use. The \"email_send\" function is designed specifically for sending emails, which aligns perfectly with the user's request. Therefore, I will choose this function.\n\nNext, I need to set the parameters for this function. The \"email_send\" function requires three parameters: recipient, subject, and body. I will map the user's input to these parameters.\n\n- **recipient**: The user specified \"john@example.com\" as the recipient. So, I will set the recipient parameter to \"john@example.com\".\n\n- **subject**: The subject of the email is 'Meeting Reminder'. Therefore, I will set the subject parameter to 'Meeting Reminder'.\n\n- **body**: The body of the email is 'Don't forget about our meeting tomorrow at 10 AM.'. Hence, I will set the body parameter to this message.\n\nIt's important to ensure that the email address is correctly formatted and that the subject and body are accurately represented as per the user's instruction.\n\nAdditionally, I should confirm that there are no other functions or parameters that need to be considered for this task. The \"csv_analytics\" function is for data analysis from CSV files, which is not relevant here. The \"search\" function is for finding information using search terms and filters, which also doesn't apply to sending an email.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate function to use is \"email_send\" with the specified parameters.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo fulfill the user's request to send an email, the \"email_send\" function should be utilized with the following parameters:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: email_send\nparams:\n  recipient: john@example.com\n  subject: Meeting Reminder\n  body: Don't forget about our meeting tomorrow at 10 AM.\n```\n\nThis configuration ensures that an email is sent to the specified recipient with the given subject and body content."
