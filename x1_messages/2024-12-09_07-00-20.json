        "content": "The Great Wall of China served the primary purpose of protecting the northern borders of the Chinese Empire from invasions by various nomadic groups. Its construction spanned several centuries and involved multiple dynasties, each contributing to its extension and fortification. The wall was not only a physical barrier but also a transportation corridor and a means of controlling trade and migration.\n\nIn terms of length, the Great Wall of China is remarkably extensive, stretching over 13,000 miles (approximately 21,000 kilometers). This makes it one of the most ambitious architectural feats in human history. However, there is a common misconception that the Great Wall can be seen from space with the naked eye. In reality, this is not the case. While it is a massive structure, the Great Wall is not visible from space without the aid of magnification or special equipment. This myth likely persists due to the wall's impressive length and historical significance.\n\nIn summary, the Great Wall of China was built for defense purposes, is over 13,000 miles long, and cannot be seen from space with the naked eye."
