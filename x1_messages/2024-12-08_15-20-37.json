        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains moving towards each other from Town A and Town B, which are 420 miles apart. The first train from Town A is going at 60 mph, and the second train from Town B is going at 80 mph. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nOkay, so since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. That makes sense because the closer they get, the faster they approach each other. So, the combined speed should be 60 mph plus 80 mph, which is 140 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between the two towns is 420 miles. If they're moving towards each other at a combined speed of 140 mph, I can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by their combined speed.\n\nSo, time equals distance divided by speed. That would be 420 miles divided by 140 mph.\n\nLet me do the math: 420 divided by 140 is 3. So, it should take 3 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If the first train is going at 60 mph, in 3 hours it would cover 180 miles. The second train is going at 80 mph, so in 3 hours, it would cover 240 miles. Added together, 180 plus 240 equals 420 miles, which is exactly the distance between the two towns.\n\nPerfect, that checks out. So, the answer should be 3 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider another approach. Let's think about their relative speed again. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is indeed the sum of their individual speeds, which is 140 mph.\n\nThe formula for time is distance divided by speed, which I applied, giving me 420 divided by 140 equals 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation. Let\u2019s say they meet after t hours. In that time, the first train would have traveled 60t miles, and the second train would have traveled 80t miles. Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the total distance between the towns.\n\nSo, 60t + 80t = 420.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 140t = 420.\n\nNow, solving for t, t = 420 / 140, which again is 3 hours.\n\nGreat, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nIs there another way to look at this problem? Maybe from the perspective of one of the trains. For example, if I consider the train from Town A, it's moving at 60 mph towards Town B, and Town B's train is moving towards it at 80 mph.\n\nFrom the perspective of the train from Town A, the train from Town B is approaching it at a relative speed of 80 mph plus 60 mph, which is again 140 mph. So, the time it takes for the train from Town B to \"cover\" the 420 miles at this relative speed is still 420 divided by 140, which is 3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the train from Town B, it's moving at 80 mph towards Town A, and Town A's train is moving towards it at 60 mph. So, from Town B's train perspective, the relative speed is again 140 mph, and the time to cover 420 miles is 3 hours.\n\nEverything points to 3 hours being the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's consider the concept of relative speed once more. When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. In this case, 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph.\n\nThe time it takes for them to meet is the total distance divided by their relative speed, which is 420 miles / 140 mph = 3 hours.\n\nI think this is solid. There doesn't seem to be any trick or additional factor in the problem that would change this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether the trains are moving on the same track or different tracks, but given that it's a straightforward problem, I think they're on a straight path towards each other.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. The speeds are in miles per hour, and the distance is in miles, so the time will be in hours, which is consistent.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the calculations are correct: 60 + 80 = 140, and 420 / 140 = 3. That seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all angles here. The answer should be 3 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
