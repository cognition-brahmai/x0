        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Creating a simple web server in Go (Golang) is quite straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you up and running:\n\n1. **Install Go**: Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n2. **Set up your workspace**: Create a new directory for your project. For example, you can name it `hello-world-server`.\n\n3. **Write the server code**: Create a new file named `main.go` in your project directory and add the following code:\n\n    ```go\n    package main\n\n    import (\n        \"fmt\"\n        \"net/http\"\n    )\n\n    func helloWorld(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        fmt.Fprintf(w, \"Hello, World!\")\n    }\n\n    func main() {\n        http.HandleFunc(\"/\", helloWorld)\n        fmt.Println(\"Starting server at port 8080\")\n        if err := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil); err != nil {\n            fmt.Println(err)\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. **Run the server**: Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command:\n\n    ```sh\n    go run main.go\n    ```\n\n5. **Access the server**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`, or use `curl` in your terminal:\n\n    ```sh\n    curl http://localhost:8080\n    ```\n\nYou should see \"Hello, World!\" displayed.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Package main**: This declares that the file is a executable program.\n\n- **Imports**: We import the necessary packages: `fmt` for formatted I/O and `net/http` for HTTP server functionalities.\n\n- **helloWorld function**: This is the handler function that writes \"Hello, World!\" to the response writer.\n\n- **main function**: Here, we define that the root URL (\"/\") should be handled by the `helloWorld` function. Then, we start the server on port 8080.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple web server in Go that responds with \"Hello, World!\".\n\n**Note:** If you're planning to deploy this server in a production environment, consider adding proper error handling, logging, and securing your server. For now, this should suffice for testing and learning purposes."
