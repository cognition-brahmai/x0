        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two trains: one leaving Town A at 4 PM and arriving in Town B at 8 PM, and another leaving Town B at 6 PM and arriving in Town A at 10 PM. We need to find out when they pass each other.\n\nFirst, let's gather some information about the trains' speeds and the distance between the towns.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- The distance between Town A and Town B as \\( d \\) miles.\n\n- The speed of the first train (from Town A to Town B) as \\( v_1 \\) miles per hour.\n\n- The speed of the second train (from Town B to Town A) as \\( v_2 \\) miles per hour.\n\nGiven that the first train leaves at 4 PM and arrives at 8 PM, its travel time is 4 hours. Therefore, its speed is:\n\n\\[ v_1 = \\frac{d}{4} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the second train leaves at 6 PM and arrives at 10 PM, so its travel time is also 4 hours. Thus, its speed is:\n\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{d}{4} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. If both trains are taking the same amount of time to cover the distance, their speeds should be the same. But let's confirm that.\n\nActually, looking back, the first train takes 4 hours (from 4 PM to 8 PM), and the second train also takes 4 hours (from 6 PM to 10 PM). So, yes, their speeds are equal, which is \\( \\frac{d}{4} \\) miles per hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out when they pass each other. Let's think about the time intervals during which both trains are on the track.\n\nThe first train is on the track from 4 PM to 8 PM.\n\nThe second train is on the track from 6 PM to 10 PM.\n\nSo, both trains are on the track between 6 PM and 8 PM.\n\nDuring this time, the first train is still traveling from Town A towards Town B, and the second train is traveling from Town B towards Town A.\n\nLet's denote the time when they pass each other as \\( t \\) PM.\n\nWe need to find \\( t \\), where \\( 6 \\leq t \\leq 8 \\).\n\nLet's calculate the distance each train has covered by time \\( t \\).\n\nFirst train:\n\n- Leaves at 4 PM, so by time \\( t \\) PM, it has been traveling for \\( t - 4 \\) hours.\n\n- Distance covered: \\( v_1 \\times (t - 4) = \\frac{d}{4} \\times (t - 4) \\)\n\nSecond train:\n\n- Leaves at 6 PM, so by time \\( t \\) PM, it has been traveling for \\( t - 6 \\) hours.\n\n- Distance covered: \\( v_2 \\times (t - 6) = \\frac{d}{4} \\times (t - 6) \\)\n\nSince they are traveling towards each other, the sum of the distances they have covered when they pass each other should be equal to the total distance between the towns:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{4} \\times (t - 4) + \\frac{d}{4} \\times (t - 6) = d \\]\n\nWe can factor out \\( \\frac{d}{4} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{4} \\times [(t - 4) + (t - 6)] = d \\]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{4} \\times (2t - 10) = d \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\( d \\) (assuming \\( d \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times (2t - 10) = 1 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ 2t - 10 = 4 \\]\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 2t = 14 \\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[ t = 7 \\]\n\nSo, the two trains pass each other at 7 PM.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check this result.\n\nIf the first train leaves at 4 PM and the second at 6 PM, and both travel at the same speed, it seems plausible that they meet at 7 PM.\n\nLet me verify the calculations.\n\nWe had:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{4} \\times (t - 4) + \\frac{d}{4} \\times (t - 6) = d \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{4} (2t - 10) = d \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} (2t - 10) = 1 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ 2t - 10 = 4 \\]\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 2t = 14 \\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[ t = 7 \\]\n\nYes, the calculations seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the two trains pass each other at 7 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
