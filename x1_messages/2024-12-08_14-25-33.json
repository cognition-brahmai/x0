        "content": "So there are 25 students in the class, and each student reads an average of 3 books per month. We want to find out how many books the entire class will read in a year.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many books one student reads in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, and each student reads 3 books per month, one student reads 3 books/month * 12 months/year = 36 books per year.\n\nNow, if one student reads 36 books in a year, then 25 students would read 25 students * 36 books/student = 900 books in a year.\n\nSo, the entire class will read 900 books in a year.\n\nBut let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to find out how many books are read by the entire class in one month and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.\n\nSo, if each student reads 3 books per month, then 25 students would read 25 * 3 = 75 books per month.\n\nThere are 12 months in a year, so 75 books/month * 12 months/year = 900 books per year.\n\nThat matches our first calculation, so I'm confident that 900 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe we should consider if all students read exactly 3 books per month, or if it's just an average. If it's an average, then some students might read more and some less, but since it's given as an average, the total should still work out to be the same.\n\nAlso, we're assuming that the reading habits are consistent throughout the year, with no breaks or variations. In reality, students might read more or less during holidays or busy periods, but since the question provides an average, we can proceed with that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is leap years or any months with different lengths, but since the reading rate is given per month, and we're multiplying by 12 months, the variation in month lengths shouldn't affect the calculation.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation, the class reads 900 books in a year.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it in weeks. There are approximately 52 weeks in a year.\n\nIf a student reads 3 books per month, and there are about 4 weeks in a month, then that's 3 books/4 weeks = 0.75 books per week.\n\nSo, one student reads 0.75 books/week.\n\nIn a year, that would be 0.75 books/week * 52 weeks/year = 39 books per year.\n\nWait, earlier we calculated that one student reads 36 books per year. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nHold on, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nIf there are 52 weeks in a year and approximately 4 weeks per month, that's 12 months * 4 weeks/month = 48 weeks, but actually, there are 52 weeks in a year.\n\nSo, if a student reads 3 books per month, that's 3 books/month * 12 months/year = 36 books/year, as I initially calculated.\n\nBut if we consider weeks, 3 books/month * (52 weeks / 12 months) = 3 * (52/12) = 3 * 4.333... \u2248 13 books per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nLet me see: 3 books per month, and 12 months per year, so 3 * 12 = 36 books per year.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to calculate it per week, first find the weekly reading rate.\n\nThere are about 4.33 weeks in a month (52 weeks / 12 months), so 3 books/month / 4.33 weeks/month \u2248 0.693 books/week.\n\nThen, 0.693 books/week * 52 weeks/year \u2248 36 books/year.\n\nSo, this confirms the initial calculation of 36 books per student per year.\n\nTherefore, for 25 students, it's 25 * 36 = 900 books per year.\n\nIt seems like the weekly calculation was confusing because of the conversion between months and weeks, but it ultimately confirms the original answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the entire class will read 900 books in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
