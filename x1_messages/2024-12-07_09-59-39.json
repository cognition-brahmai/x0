        "content": "So there are 50 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I think about smaller numbers to understand the pattern. Let's say there are 2 people in the room. Person A and Person B. They each shake hands with each other once, so that's 1 handshake.\n\nNow, if there are 3 people: Person A, B, and C. A shakes hands with B and C, and B shakes hands with C. So that's 3 handshakes in total.\n\nWait, is there a pattern here? For 2 people, 1 handshake. For 3 people, 3 handshakes.\n\nLet me try with 4 people: A, B, C, D. A shakes hands with B, C, D (that's 3 handshakes). B shakes hands with C and D (but the handshake between A and B already happened, so we don't count it again), that's 2 more handshakes. C shakes hands with D (again, handshakes with A and B already counted), so 1 more handshake. Total: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 handshakes.\n\nSimilarly, for 5 people: A, B, C, D, E. A shakes hands with B, C, D, E (4 handshakes). B shakes hands with C, D, E (3 more handshakes). C shakes hands with D, E (2 more handshakes). D shakes hands with E (1 more handshake). Total: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes.\n\nI see a pattern here. For n people, the total number of handshakes seems to be the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers. So for n people, it's (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1.\n\nWait, that's the same as n(n-1)/2. I recall that from math class. The formula for combinations, specifically \"n choose 2,\" which is the number of ways to choose 2 items out of n, without regard to order.\n\nYes, that makes sense because each handshake involves 2 people, and the order doesn't matter. So, the total number of unique handshakes is C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for 50 people, it should be 50 * 49 / 2.\n\nLet me calculate that: 50 times 49 is 2450, divided by 2 is 1225.\n\nTherefore, there are 1225 handshakes in total.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAnother approach: each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, for each pair of people, there's one handshake.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is equal to the number of unique pairs of people in the room.\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 50 is C(50, 2), which again is 50*49/2 = 1225.\n\nOkay, that confirms the first method.\n\nIs there any other way to look at it? Maybe using permutations?\n\nWell, if I think about permutations, the number of ways to arrange 2 people out of 50 is P(50, 2), which is 50*49 = 2450.\n\nBut in this case, since the order doesn't matter in a handshake (A shaking hands with B is the same as B shaking hands with A), we've counted each handshake twice in the permutations.\n\nTherefore, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, we need to divide that by 2, which gives us 2450 / 2 = 1225 again.\n\nSo, all these methods lead me back to 1225 handshakes.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance I'm missing something. Is there any possibility that some handshakes are being counted multiple times or not being counted at all?\n\nGiven that the problem states \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" I think the calculation is straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any constraints or special cases.\n\nFor example, what if there are people who don't shake hands with certain others? But the problem says \"each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once,\" so no exceptions.\n\nAlso, assuming that no one shakes their own hand, which would be odd anyway.\n\nSo, no, I think 1225 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it recursively.\n\nSuppose I have 1 person: no handshakes.\n\nAdd a second person: they shake hands with the first, so total handshakes are 1.\n\nAdd a third person: they shake hands with the first two, adding 2 more handshakes, for a total of 3.\n\nAdd a fourth person: they shake hands with the first three, adding 3 more handshakes, for a total of 6.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each new person adds handshakes equal to the number of people already in the room.\n\nTherefore, the total handshakes are 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1), which again is n(n-1)/2.\n\nFor n=50, that's 50*49/2 = 1225.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough different ways that I can be confident in the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1225} \\]"
