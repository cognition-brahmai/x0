        "content": "So there's this problem here: A company has 200 workers, and 70% of them are men. I need to find out how many women work there. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of workers is 200. Out of these, 70% are men. So, to find the number of men, I can calculate 70% of 200. The percentage formula is:\n\nNumber of men = (Percentage of men / 100) * Total workers\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of men = (70 / 100) * 200\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n70 divided by 100 is 0.7.\n\n0.7 multiplied by 200 is 140.\n\nSo, there are 140 men in the company.\n\nNow, to find the number of women, I can subtract the number of men from the total number of workers.\n\nNumber of women = Total workers - Number of men\n\nNumber of women = 200 - 140\n\nThat gives me 60 women.\n\nWait, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by calculating the percentage of women directly.\n\nIf 70% are men, then the remaining percentage must be women, right? So, 100% - 70% = 30% are women.\n\nThen, I can calculate 30% of 200 to find the number of women.\n\nNumber of women = (30 / 100) * 200\n\n30 divided by 100 is 0.3.\n\n0.3 multiplied by 200 is 60.\n\nSo, again, I get 60 women.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is good. It confirms that 60 is the correct number of women working at the company.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of workers is 200. 70% are men, which is 140 men. Subtracting that from the total gives 60 women, or 30% of the total workforce.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I think 60 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
