        "content": "So I've got this problem: if you roll two fair six-sided dice, what's the probability that their sum will be prime? Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst things first, when you roll two six-sided dice, each die has numbers from 1 to 6. So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is 6 times 6, which is 36. That makes sense because each die is independent of the other.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 36 outcomes result in a sum that's a prime number. So, I should list out all possible sums and see which ones are prime.\n\nLet's list out all possible sums:\n\nThe smallest sum is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThe largest sum is 6 + 6 = 12.\n\nSo, possible sums are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\n\nNow, which of these are prime numbers?\n\n2 is prime.\n\n3 is prime.\n\n5 is prime.\n\n7 is prime.\n\n11 is prime.\n\nSo, the prime sums are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many ways I can get each of these sums.\n\nLet's start with sum = 2.\n\nOnly one way: both dice show 1.\n\nSum = 3.\n\nTwo ways: 1 and 2, or 2 and 1.\n\nSum = 5.\n\nFour ways: 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 3 and 2, 4 and 1.\n\nSum = 7.\n\nSix ways: 1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4, 4 and 3, 5 and 2, 6 and 1.\n\nSum = 11.\n\nTwo ways: 5 and 6, or 6 and 5.\n\nSo, total number of favorable outcomes is 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 15 out of 36.\n\nSimplifying that fraction, divide numerator and denominator by 3, so 15/36 = 5/12.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check my addition: 1 + 2 is 3, plus 4 is 7, plus 6 is 13, plus 2 is 15. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd 15/36 simplifies to 5/12.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/12.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't miss any possible ways to get a prime sum.\n\nSum of 2: only (1,1).\n\nSum of 3: (1,2), (2,1).\n\nSum of 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1).\n\nSum of 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1).\n\nSum of 11: (5,6), (6,5).\n\nThat's all the prime sums, and total of 15 ways.\n\nYes, I'm confident with 5/12.\n\nAlternatively, some people might like to express this as a decimal or percentage, but since the question didn't specify, I'll stick with the fraction.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}} \\]"
