        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 10 houses on one side of the street and 15 on the other, and each house has a dog. That means there are 10 dogs on one side and 15 on the other.\n\nInitially, all dogs from the first side gather in one yard, and all from the second side gather in another yard. So, one yard has 10 dogs, and the other has 15 dogs.\n\nThen, two dogs from each yard go to visit their friends at the opposite yards. So, two dogs from the first yard (which has 10 dogs) go to the second yard (which has 15 dogs), and two dogs from the second yard go to the first yard.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, two dogs from the first yard (with 10 dogs) go to the second yard (with 15 dogs). So, the first yard loses two dogs and the second yard gains two dogs.\n\nSo, the first yard now has 10 - 2 = 8 dogs.\n\nThe second yard has 15 + 2 = 17 dogs.\n\nBut wait, at the same time, two dogs from the second yard go to the first yard.\n\nSo, from the second yard, two dogs are leaving to go to the first yard.\n\nSo, the second yard loses two dogs, and the first yard gains two dogs.\n\nSo, from the second yard: 17 - 2 = 15 dogs.\n\nAnd the first yard: 8 + 2 = 10 dogs.\n\nWait a minute, but this seems a bit confusing. Let me try to think differently.\n\nInitially:\n\n- Yard A: 10 dogs\n\n- Yard B: 15 dogs\n\nThen:\n\n- Two dogs from Yard A go to Yard B.\n\n- Two dogs from Yard B go to Yard A.\n\nSo, the net change is:\n\n- Yard A: loses 2 dogs to Yard B, gains 2 dogs from Yard B.\n\n- Yard B: gains 2 dogs from Yard A, loses 2 dogs to Yard A.\n\nSo, effectively, Yard A: 10 - 2 + 2 = 10 dogs.\n\nYard B: 15 - 2 + 2 = 15 dogs.\n\nWait, that means the number of dogs in each yard remains the same!\n\nBut that can't be right. Let me see what's going on here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the order of events.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- First, two dogs from Yard A go to Yard B.\n\n- Then, two dogs from Yard B (which now includes the two from Yard A) go to Yard A.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Simultaneously, two dogs from each yard go to the other yard.\n\nIf it's simultaneous:\n\n- Yard A: starts with 10, loses 2, gains 2 from Yard B, so 10 - 2 + 2 = 10.\n\n- Yard B: starts with 15, loses 2, gains 2 from Yard A, so 15 - 2 + 2 = 15.\n\nSo, in this case, the number of dogs in each yard doesn't change.\n\nBut perhaps the problem implies that the dogs are moving one after the other.\n\nLet me try Option 1:\n\n1. Two dogs from Yard A go to Yard B.\n\n- Yard A: 10 - 2 = 8 dogs.\n\n- Yard B: 15 + 2 = 17 dogs.\n\n2. Then, two dogs from Yard B go to Yard A.\n\n- But now Yard B has 17 dogs, including the two that came from Yard A.\n\n- So, when two dogs from Yard B go to Yard A, they could be:\n\na) Both original dogs from Yard B.\n\nb) One original from Yard B and one from Yard A.\n\nc) Both from Yard A.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"two dogs from each yard go to visit their friends at the opposite yards.\"\n\nIt's a bit ambiguous about whether the visiting dogs are from the original inhabitants or including the visitors.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the dogs that go to the opposite yard are only from the original inhabitants.\n\nSo, in step 1:\n\n- Two dogs from Yard A (original dogs from Yard A) go to Yard B.\n\n- Now, Yard A has 8 dogs (original), Yard B has 15 + 2 = 17 dogs.\n\nThen, in step 2:\n\n- Two dogs from Yard B (original dogs from Yard B) go to Yard A.\n\n- Now, Yard B has 17 - 2 = 15 dogs.\n\n- Yard A has 8 + 2 = 10 dogs.\n\nSo, in the end, Yard A has 10 dogs, and Yard B has 15 dogs, which is the same as the beginning.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. Maybe the problem means that the dogs that go to the opposite yard are from the current inhabitants, including any visitors.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n1. Two dogs from Yard A (original dogs) go to Yard B.\n\n- Yard A: 8 dogs.\n\n- Yard B: 15 + 2 = 17 dogs.\n\n2. Then, two dogs from Yard B (which now includes two dogs from Yard A) go to Yard A.\n\n- Suppose both dogs from Yard B that go to Yard A are original from Yard B.\n\n- Then, Yard B: 17 - 2 = 15 dogs.\n\n- Yard A: 8 + 2 = 10 dogs.\n\n- Total: Yard A has 10, Yard B has 15.\n\n- Or, if one dog is from Yard B and one is from Yard A.\n\n- Then, Yard B: 17 - 1 (from B) -1 (from A) = 15 dogs.\n\n- Yard A: 8 +1 (from B) +1 (from A) = 10 dogs.\n\n- Wait, but the dogs from A that go to B and then back are the same dogs, so it's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dogs that go to the opposite yard are only the original inhabitants, not including any visitors.\n\nThen, it's the same as before: Yard A has 10, Yard B has 15 in the end.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's another way to interpret it.\n\nLet me consider that when dogs visit the opposite yard, they stay there.\n\nBut the problem says \"visit,\" which implies they might return.\n\nBut perhaps they stay.\n\nIf they stay, then:\n\n- Two dogs from Yard A go to Yard B and stay.\n\n- Two dogs from Yard B go to Yard A and stay.\n\n- So, Yard A: 10 - 2 + 2 = 10 dogs.\n\n- Yard B: 15 - 2 + 2 = 15 dogs.\n\nAgain, no change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the visiting dogs are in addition to the original dogs.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because they are visiting, not staying.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total number of dogs.\n\nThere are 10 + 15 = 25 dogs in total.\n\nNo dogs are added or removed, just moved between yards.\n\nSo, the sum should always be 25 dogs.\n\nIf two dogs go from Yard A to Yard B, and two go from Yard B to Yard A, the net movement is zero, so the number in each yard remains the same.\n\nTherefore, Yard A still has 10 dogs, and Yard B has 15 dogs.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the visiting dogs are temporarily in the opposite yard.\n\nBut the problem says \"go to visit,\" which likely means they are now in the opposite yard.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that Yard A has 10 dogs, and Yard B has 15 dogs, unchanged.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the visiting dogs are included in the count of the opposite yard.\n\nSo, if two dogs from Yard A are in Yard B, and two from Yard B are in Yard A, then:\n\n- Yard A: original 10 - 2 (that went to Yard B) + 2 (from Yard B) = 10 dogs.\n\n- Yard B: original 15 - 2 (that went to Yard A) + 2 (from Yard A) = 15 dogs.\n\nAgain, no change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the visiting dogs are not included in the count of their original yard but are included in the count of the yard they are visiting.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Yard A: 10 - 2 (that left) + 2 (visiting from Yard B) = 10 dogs.\n\n- Yard B: 15 - 2 (that left) + 2 (visiting from Yard A) = 15 dogs.\n\nStill no change.\n\nI must be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as:\n\n- Initially, all dogs from one side are in one yard, and all from the other side are in another yard.\n\n- Then, two dogs from the first yard go to the second yard, and two dogs from the second yard go to the first yard.\n\n- So, the first yard loses two dogs and gains two dogs, while the second yard gains two dogs and loses two dogs.\n\n- Therefore, the number of dogs in each yard remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different interpretation.\n\nSuppose that the two dogs from Yard A that go to Yard B are different from the two dogs from Yard B that go to Yard A.\n\nIn that case, it's still a swap, and the number remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some dogs are moving simultaneously.\n\nBut again, it seems like the net effect is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the dogs moving in a specific sequence.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the dogs that visit staying in the opposite yard.\n\nBut that would mean the number remains the same, as dogs are just moving back and forth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the visiting dogs are in addition to the original dogs.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because visiting dogs are already included in the count of the yard they are in.\n\nI think the answer is that each yard still has the same number of dogs: Yard A has 10 dogs, and Yard B has 15 dogs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the dogs mingling and some staying behind.\n\nBut that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the visiting dogs are not counted in the final count.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the number of dogs in each yard after the visits.\n\nBut it seems like the visits don't change the number of dogs in each yard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the visiting dogs are only temporarily in the opposite yard and then return.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven all this, I think the answer is that Yard A has 10 dogs and Yard B has 15 dogs.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider that the visiting dogs are now part of the opposite yard.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Yard A loses two dogs to Yard B and gains two dogs from Yard B.\n\n- Yard B gains two dogs from Yard A and loses two dogs to Yard A.\n\nSo, net change is zero, and each yard still has the same number of dogs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the visiting dogs are considered to be in the opposite yard.\n\nIn that case, again, the number remains the same.\n\nI think the answer is that each yard has the same number of dogs as before: Yard A has 10 dogs, and Yard B has 15 dogs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yard A has 10 dogs and Yard B has 15 dogs.}} \\]"
