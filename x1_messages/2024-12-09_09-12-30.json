        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to paint a rectangular room that's 12 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet high. I need to figure out how many square feet of wall space that entails. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, a rectangular room has four walls, right? Two walls will be the length of the room, and two will be the width. The height of all walls is the same, which is 8 feet here. So, I need to find the area of each wall and then add them up.\n\nLet me start by calculating the area of the longer walls. Each of these walls is 12 feet long and 8 feet high. So, the area of one long wall is length times height, which is 12 feet times 8 feet, giving me 96 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, I'll multiply that by 2, which is 192 square feet.\n\nNext, the shorter walls are 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one short wall is 10 feet times 8 feet, which is 80 square feet. Again, there are two of these walls, so 80 square feet times 2 equals 160 square feet.\n\nNow, to find the total wall area, I'll add the areas of the long and short walls together. That's 192 square feet plus 160 square feet, which equals 352 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that sometimes when painting a room, you might not paint the ceiling or the floor. In this problem, it specifies \"wall space,\" so I think only the walls are to be painted. But just to be sure, I'll double-check.\n\nThe room is rectangular, with dimensions given as length, width, and height. Typically, length and width define the floor plan, and height defines how tall the walls are. So, the walls are vertically extending from the floor to the ceiling, with the lengths and widths as specified.\n\nSo, the total wall area should indeed be the sum of the areas of all four walls.\n\nLet me verify my calculations:\n\n- Long walls: 12 feet x 8 feet = 96 sq ft each\n\n- Two long walls: 96 sq ft x 2 = 192 sq ft\n\n- Short walls: 10 feet x 8 feet = 80 sq ft each\n\n- Two short walls: 80 sq ft x 2 = 160 sq ft\n\n- Total wall area: 192 sq ft + 160 sq ft = 352 sq ft\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any openings like doors or windows, but the problem doesn't mention any. So, I'll assume the wall space to be painted is the total area of the walls without any deductions.\n\nWait, in some painting calculations, you might subtract the areas of doors and windows because you don't paint those. But since the problem doesn't specify any openings, I'll proceed with the total wall area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the surface area of the walls in a rectangular room. Let's see.\n\nThe surface area of the walls would be the perimeter of the room times the height, minus the areas of any openings.\n\nThe perimeter of the room is 2 times (length + width), which is 2 times (12 + 10) = 2 times 22 = 44 feet.\n\nThen, the total wall area would be perimeter times height: 44 feet times 8 feet = 352 square feet.\n\nHey, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, whether I calculate each wall individually or use the perimeter method, I get the same total wall area of 352 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the amount of wall space that needs to be painted is 352 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{352} \\]"
