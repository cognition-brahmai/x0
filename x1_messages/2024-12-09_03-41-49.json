        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're told that the ratio of men to women in a city is 3:4, and there are 28,000 men. We need to find out the total population of the city.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio compares two quantities. Here, for every 3 men, there are 4 women. So, the number of men is 3 parts, and the number of women is 4 parts.\n\nGiven that there are 28,000 men, which corresponds to the 3 parts in the ratio, I can find out what one part represents. To do that, I'll divide the number of men by 3.\n\nSo, one part is 28,000 divided by 3. Let me calculate that:\n\n28,000 \u00f7 3 = 9,333.333...\n\nHmm, that's a repeating decimal. Maybe I should keep it as a fraction to be more precise. So, 28,000 divided by 3 is 9,333 and one-third, or 9,333\u2153.\n\nNow, since the number of women is 4 parts, I'll multiply one part by 4 to find the number of women.\n\nNumber of women = 4 \u00d7 9,333\u2153 = 37,333\u2153\n\nWait, but population numbers are whole numbers, isn't it? Having a fraction of a person doesn't make sense. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the ratio as fractions. The ratio of men to women is 3:4, which means men are 3/7 of the total population, and women are 4/7 of the total population. Because 3 + 4 = 7 parts in total.\n\nSo, if men are 3/7 of the total population, and there are 28,000 men, I can set up an equation to find the total population (let's call it T).\n\nEquation: 3/7 \u00d7 T = 28,000\n\nNow, I need to solve for T.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 7 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n3T = 28,000 \u00d7 7\n\nCalculate 28,000 \u00d7 7:\n\n28,000 \u00d7 7 = 196,000\n\nSo, 3T = 196,000\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to solve for T:\n\nT = 196,000 \u00f7 3\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n196,000 \u00f7 3 = 65,333.333...\n\nAgain, I get a repeating decimal. That suggests that the total population isn't a whole number, which is impractical because you can't have a fraction of a person in population counts.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check.\n\nIf the ratio of men to women is 3:4, then the ratio of men to total population is 3:(3+4) = 3:7.\n\nSo, men are 3/7 of the total population.\n\nGiven that, the equation 3/7 \u00d7 T = 28,000 seems correct.\n\nSolving for T, I get T = 28,000 \u00d7 (7/3) = 28,000 \u00d7 7 \u00f7 3 = 196,000 \u00f7 3 = 65,333.333...\n\nThis suggests that the total population is approximately 65,333, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers given aren't exact, or perhaps there's a different approach I should take.\n\nLet me try another approach. If the ratio of men to women is 3:4, then for every 3 men, there are 4 women. So, the number of men is 3 parts, and the number of women is 4 parts, making a total of 7 parts.\n\nGiven that 3 parts correspond to 28,000 men, I can find the number of people per part, and then find the total number of parts.\n\nNumber of people per part = 28,000 \u00f7 3 = 9,333.333...\n\nThen, total parts are 7, so total population = 7 \u00d7 9,333.333... = 65,333.333...\n\nAgain, I end up with the same repeating decimal.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the actual number of men is a multiple of 3, so that when divided by 3, it gives a whole number. But 28,000 isn't divisible by 3 without a remainder.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the ratio is approximate, and I should round the numbers accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city has exactly 28,000 men, and the ratio is exact, meaning that the total population isn't a whole number, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem has an error, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try another method. Suppose I let the number of men be 3x and the number of women be 4x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nGiven that men are 3x = 28,000\n\nSo, x = 28,000 \u00f7 3 = 9,333.333...\n\nThen, women are 4x = 4 \u00d7 9,333.333... = 37,333.333...\n\nTotal population = men + women = 28,000 + 37,333.333... = 65,333.333...\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to express the total population as a fraction.\n\nSo, total population T = 28,000 + (4/3 \u00d7 28,000) = 28,000 + 37,333.333... = 65,333.333...\n\nAlternatively, T = (7/3) \u00d7 28,000 = 196,000 \u00f7 3 = 65,333.333...\n\nIn terms of fractions, 196,000 \u00f7 3 = 65,333 and 1/3.\n\nSo, the total population is 65,333 and 1/3 people.\n\nBut again, you can't have one-third of a person.\n\nMaybe the problem assumes that the ratio is approximate, and we should round to the nearest whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of men isn't exactly 28,000, but proportionally equivalent in the ratio.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should accept that the total population is approximately 65,333 people.\n\nSo, my final answer is [B] 65,333\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65333} \\]"
