        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an election where candidate X got 45% of the total votes, candidate Y got 35%, and the rest went to other candidates. The total number of votes cast was 120,000. We need to find out how many more votes candidate X received compared to candidate Y.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many votes each candidate received. Since candidate X got 45% of the total votes, I can calculate that by taking 45% of 120,000. Similarly, candidate Y got 35% of the total votes, so I'll calculate 35% of 120,000. Then, to find out how many more votes X received than Y, I'll subtract Y's votes from X's votes.\n\nLet me start by calculating X's votes:\n\nX's votes = 45% of 120,000\n\nTo calculate that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply by the total votes.\n\n45% = 0.45\n\nSo, X's votes = 0.45 * 120,000\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.45 * 120,000 = 54,000\n\nSo, candidate X received 54,000 votes.\n\nNow, let's calculate Y's votes:\n\nY's votes = 35% of 120,000\n\nAgain, convert the percentage to a decimal:\n\n35% = 0.35\n\nSo, Y's votes = 0.35 * 120,000\n\nLet me multiply:\n\n0.35 * 120,000 = 42,000\n\nCandidate Y received 42,000 votes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes X received than Y, I'll subtract Y's votes from X's votes:\n\n54,000 - 42,000 = 12,000\n\nSo, candidate X received 12,000 more votes than candidate Y.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The calculations seem straightforward, but it's always good to verify.\n\nFirst, 45% of 120,000:\n\n0.45 * 120,000 = 54,000 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 35% of 120,000:\n\n0.35 * 120,000 = 42,000 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSubtracting Y's votes from X's votes:\n\n54,000 - 42,000 = 12,000 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. So, the final answer is 12,000 votes.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the remaining votes to see if they make sense. The problem says the remaining votes were distributed among other candidates. Let's see what percentage that is.\n\nTotal percentage should add up to 100%. Candidate X has 45%, Y has 35%, so together they have 80%. Therefore, the other candidates received 20% of the votes.\n\nLet's calculate that to verify:\n\nOther candidates' votes = 20% of 120,000\n\n20% = 0.20\n\n0.20 * 120,000 = 24,000\n\nSo, other candidates received 24,000 votes.\n\nNow, let's add up all the votes to make sure they total 120,000:\n\nX's votes: 54,000\n\nY's votes: 42,000\n\nOther candidates: 24,000\n\nTotal: 54,000 + 42,000 + 24,000 = 120,000 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything adds up correctly, so my calculation is confirmed.\n\nTherefore, candidate X received 12,000 more votes than candidate Y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12000} \\]"
