        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 15 balls in a box, and each ball weighs either 1 kg or 2 kg. The total weight of all the balls is 22 kg, and I need to figure out how many 1 kg balls are in the box. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think I should define variables for the number of 1 kg balls and the number of 2 kg balls. Let's say:\n\n- Let x be the number of 1 kg balls.\n\n- Let y be the number of 2 kg balls.\n\nNow, since there are 15 balls in total, I can write the equation:\n\nx + y = 15\n\nAnd because the total weight is 22 kg, and each 1 kg ball contributes 1 kg and each 2 kg ball contributes 2 kg, I can write another equation:\n\n1x + 2y = 22\n\nSo now I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. x + y = 15\n\n2. x + 2y = 22\n\nI need to solve for x and y. Maybe I can use the substitution or elimination method. Let's try the elimination method.\n\nIf I subtract the first equation from the second equation, I get:\n\n(x + 2y) - (x + y) = 22 - 15\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx + 2y - x - y = 7\n\nSo, y = 7\n\nNow that I have y = 7, which is the number of 2 kg balls, I can plug this back into the first equation to find x.\n\nx + 7 = 15\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n\nx = 15 - 7\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 balls that weigh 1 kg and 7 balls that weigh 2 kg. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal number of balls: 8 + 7 = 15, which matches.\n\nTotal weight: (8 * 1) + (7 * 2) = 8 + 14 = 22 kg, which also matches.\n\nAlright, that seems correct. But maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAnother approach could be to assume that all balls are 1 kg and then see how much more weight is needed to reach 22 kg.\n\nIf all 15 balls are 1 kg, the total weight would be 15 kg. But the actual total is 22 kg, which is 7 kg more.\n\nSince each 2 kg ball adds an extra 1 kg compared to a 1 kg ball, I need to replace some 1 kg balls with 2 kg balls to make up the additional 7 kg.\n\nSo, for each 2 kg ball I substitute for a 1 kg ball, I gain 1 kg in total weight.\n\nTherefore, to gain 7 kg, I need to substitute 7 balls with 2 kg balls.\n\nSo, number of 2 kg balls is 7, and number of 1 kg balls is 15 - 7 = 8.\n\nThis matches what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of averages.\n\nThe average weight per ball is 22 kg / 15 balls = approximately 1.4667 kg per ball.\n\nSince the only possible weights are 1 kg and 2 kg, the average is somewhere between 1 and 2.\n\nTo find the ratio, I can set up the equation:\n\n( number of 1 kg balls * 1 + number of 2 kg balls * 2 ) / 15 = 22 / 15\n\nBut that seems more complicated than the first method.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of mixtures.\n\nLet\u2019s say the proportion of 1 kg balls is p, and the proportion of 2 kg balls is 1 - p.\n\nThen, the average weight is p*1 + (1-p)*2 = 22/15\n\nSo,\n\np + 2 - 2p = 22/15\n\n2 - p = 22/15\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n- p = 22/15 - 30/15 = -8/15\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\np = 8/15\n\nSo, the proportion of 1 kg balls is 8/15, and the number of 1 kg balls is 8.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 2 kg balls is 15 - 8 = 7.\n\nAgain, this matches my previous result.\n\nLet me try one more way to confirm.\n\nSuppose I let x be the number of 1 kg balls, then the number of 2 kg balls is 15 - x.\n\nThe total weight is then:\n\n1*x + 2*(15 - x) = 22\n\nSimplify:\n\nx + 30 - 2x = 22\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- x + 30 = 22\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n- x = -8\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, again, x = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 balls that weigh 1 kg.\n\nI think that's consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to summarize, using different approaches\u2014systems of equations, substitution, average weight, and proportional mixtures\u2014I consistently arrive at the conclusion that there are 8 balls weighing 1 kg in the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
