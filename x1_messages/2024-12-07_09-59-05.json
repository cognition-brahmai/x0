        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a simple C++ text-based number guessing game. I'll walk you through the steps and provide you with the code. Let's get started!\n\nFirst, we need to include the necessary headers. We'll need `<iostream>` for input and output, `<cstdlib>` for generating random numbers, and `<ctime>` to seed the random number generator.\n\nHere's the starting point:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n\nint main() {\n    // Code will go here\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNext, we need to generate a random number between 1 and 100. To do this, we'll seed the random number generator with the current time using `srand(time(0))`, and then use `rand() % 100 + 1` to get a number between 1 and 100.\n\nLet's add that:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n\nint main() {\n    srand(time(0));\n    int secretNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;\n    // Rest of the code\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNow, we need to get the user's guess. We'll use a loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they get it right. A `do-while` loop is perfect for this because it ensures that the user guesses at least once.\n\nInside the loop, we'll prompt the user to enter their guess and read it using `std::cin`.\n\nHere's how that looks:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n\nint main() {\n    srand(time(0));\n    int secretNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;\n    int userGuess;\n\n    do {\n        std::cout << \"Guess the number between 1 and 100: \";\n        std::cin >> userGuess;\n\n        if (userGuess > secretNumber) {\n            std::cout << \"Too high!\\n\";\n        } else if (userGuess < secretNumber) {\n            std::cout << \"Too low!\\n\";\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Congratulations! You guessed it right.\\n\";\n        }\n    } while (userGuess != secretNumber);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThat's the basic structure of the game. Let's make it a bit more user-friendly by adding a way to exit the game if the user wants to stop guessing.\n\nWe can modify the loop to allow the user to enter a special value, say 0, to quit.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n\nint main() {\n    srand(time(0));\n    int secretNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;\n    int userGuess;\n\n    std::cout << \"Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\\n\";\n    std::cout << \"I've selected a number between 1 and 100.\\n\";\n    std::cout << \"Try to guess it. Enter 0 to quit.\\n\";\n\n    do {\n        std::cout << \"Enter your guess: \";\n        std::cin >> userGuess;\n\n        if (userGuess == 0) {\n            std::cout << \"You've chosen to quit. The secret number was \" << secretNumber << \".\\n\";\n            break;\n        } else if (userGuess > secretNumber) {\n            std::cout << \"Too high!\\n\";\n        } else if (userGuess < secretNumber) {\n            std::cout << \"Too low!\\n\";\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Congratulations! You guessed it right.\\n\";\n        }\n    } while (userGuess != secretNumber);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis version allows the user to quit by entering 0 and informs them of the secret number if they choose to quit.\n\nFinally, let's add some error handling to make sure that the user enters a valid integer. We can do this by checking if `std::cin` fails after reading the input.\n\nHere's the complete code with input validation:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n\nint main() {\n    srand(time(0));\n    int secretNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;\n    int userGuess;\n    bool validInput;\n\n    std::cout << \"Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\\n\";\n    std::cout << \"I've selected a number between 1 and 100.\\n\";\n    std::cout << \"Try to guess it. Enter 0 to quit.\\n\";\n\n    do {\n        std::cout << \"Enter your guess: \";\n        validInput = (std::cin >> userGuess);\n\n        if (!validInput) {\n            std::cout << \"Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\\n\";\n            std::cin.clear();\n            std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        if (userGuess == 0) {\n            std::cout << \"You've chosen to quit. The secret number was \" << secretNumber << \".\\n\";\n            break;\n        } else if (userGuess > secretNumber) {\n            std::cout << \"Too high!\\n\";\n        } else if (userGuess < secretNumber) {\n            std::cout << \"Too low!\\n\";\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Congratulations! You guessed it right.\\n\";\n        }\n    } while (userGuess != secretNumber);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, if the user enters something that's not an integer, the program will prompt them again for a valid input.\n\nThat's it! You now have a simple C++ text-based number guessing game with basic features and input validation.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a simple C++ text-based number guessing game, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Include necessary headers:**\n   - `<iostream>` for input and output.\n   - `<cstdlib>` for generating random numbers.\n   - `<ctime>` to seed the random number generator.\n\n2. **Seed the random number generator:**\n   - Use `srand(time(0))` to ensure different sequences of random numbers on each run.\n\n3. **Generate a random number:**\n   - Use `rand() % 100 + 1` to get a number between 1 and 100.\n\n4. **Implement a guessing loop:**\n   - Use a `do-while` loop to allow repeated guesses until the correct number is guessed.\n   - Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.\n\n5. **Add an option to quit:**\n   - Allow the user to enter 0 to quit the game and reveal the secret number.\n\n6. **Include input validation:**\n   - Ensure the user enters a valid integer, prompting again if invalid input is detected.\n\n### Final Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <limits>\n\nint main() {\n    srand(time(0));\n    int secretNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;\n    int userGuess;\n    bool validInput;\n\n    std::cout << \"Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\\n\";\n    std::cout << \"I've selected a number between 1 and 100.\\n\";\n    std::cout << \"Try to guess it. Enter 0 to quit.\\n\";\n\n    do {\n        std::cout << \"Enter your guess: \";\n        validInput = (std::cin >> userGuess);\n\n        if (!validInput) {\n            std::cout << \"Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\\n\";\n            std::cin.clear();\n            std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        if (userGuess == 0) {\n            std::cout << \"You've chosen to quit. The secret number was \" << secretNumber << \".\\n\";\n            break;\n        } else if (userGuess > secretNumber) {\n            std::cout << \"Too high!\\n\";\n        } else if (userGuess < secretNumber) {\n            std::cout << \"Too low!\\n\";\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Congratulations! You guessed it right.\\n\";\n        }\n    } while (userGuess != secretNumber);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Random Number Generation:** The secret number is generated using `rand() % 100 + 1`, ensuring it's between 1 and 100.\n- **Guessing Loop:** A `do-while` loop allows repeated guesses until the correct number is guessed or the user quits.\n- **Input Validation:** Checks if the input is a valid integer and handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n- **Quitting Option:** User can enter 0 to quit the game, and the secret number is revealed."
