        "content": "Let's see. There are 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 10 green balls in a box. I need to find the probability of picking a red ball. Okay, probability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, first, I should figure out the total number of balls in the box. That would be 4 red plus 6 blue plus 10 green, which is 4 + 6 + 10 = 20 balls in total.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is picking a red ball, which there are 4 of. So, the probability should be 4 red balls divided by 20 total balls. That simplifies to 1/5, or 0.2, which is 20%.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe considering the colors or something else, but I think that's the straightforward approach. Or perhaps there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the balls are not equally likely to be picked. For example, maybe the green balls are larger and have a higher chance of being selected. But the problem doesn't say anything about that, so I have to assume that each ball has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nAnother thought: is there replacement or not? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's about picking one ball, I think it's a single draw without replacement. So, that shouldn't affect the probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are different sections in the box where balls of certain colors are grouped, but again, the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nI think the simplest and most straightforward approach is the correct one: total number of red balls divided by total number of balls.\n\nSo, probability = 4 / (4 + 6 + 10) = 4/20 = 1/5.\n\nI can also express this in percentage terms, which is 20%, or as a decimal, 0.2.\n\nLet me check if there's any other information I might be missing. The problem provides numbers for blue and green balls, but since I'm only interested in red balls, those are just part of the total.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 1 minus the probability of not picking a red ball. So, probability of not picking red is (6 blue + 10 green)/20 = 16/20 = 4/5. Therefore, probability of picking red is 1 - 4/5 = 1/5, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThat's a good way to verify the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of red balls to the total balls. Again, that's 4:20, which simplifies to 1:5, so 1/5.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The probability is 1/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}} \\]"
