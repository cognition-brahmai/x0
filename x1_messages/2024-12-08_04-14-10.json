        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a group of 50 people, 15 have brown eyes, 10 have blue eyes, and the rest have green eyes. I need to find out what proportion of the group has green eyes. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many people have green eyes. The total number of people is 50. Out of these, 15 have brown eyes and 10 have blue eyes. So, the number of people with green eyes would be the total number minus those with brown and blue eyes.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of people with green eyes = Total number of people - Number with brown eyes - Number with blue eyes\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of people with green eyes = 50 - 15 - 10\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n50 minus 15 is 35, and then 35 minus 10 is 25. So, 25 people have green eyes.\n\nNow, the question asks for the proportion of the group that has green eyes. Proportion usually means part over whole, so it would be the number of people with green eyes divided by the total number of people.\n\nSo, proportion of green-eyed people = Number of green-eyed people / Total number of people\n\nThat is:\n\nProportion = 25 / 50\n\nSimplifying that fraction:\n\n25 divided by 50 is 0.5, or in fraction terms, it's 1/2.\n\nSo, the proportion of the group that has green eyes is 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the proportions of each eye color and then add them up.\n\nFirst, proportion with brown eyes = 15/50 = 0.3 or 3/10\n\nProportion with blue eyes = 10/50 = 0.2 or 1/5\n\nProportion with green eyes = 25/50 = 0.5 or 1/2\n\nNow, if I add these proportions up:\n\n0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0, which is full proportion, making sense since all people are accounted for.\n\nAlternatively, in fractions:\n\n3/10 + 1/5 + 1/2\n\nTo add these, I need a common denominator. Let's use 10.\n\n3/10 + 2/10 + 5/10 = 10/10 = 1\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, my initial answer seems correct. The proportion of green-eyed people is indeed 1/2.\n\nBut maybe I can express it in percentages as well for better understanding.\n\nProportion of 1/2 is equivalent to 50%.\n\nSo, 50% of the group has green eyes.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If half the group has green eyes, then the proportion is 1/2.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I consider the ratio of green-eyed people to the total number of people.\n\nThat would be 25:50, which simplifies to 1:2.\n\nSo, the ratio is 1:2, meaning for every green-eyed person, there are two people in total.\n\nBut proportion is often expressed as a fraction, so 1/2 is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes proportions are expressed relative to each other, but in this case, it's clear that it's asking for the part to the whole.\n\nSo, I think 1/2 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nThe problem states that the rest have green eyes, meaning everyone who doesn't have brown or blue eyes has green eyes.\n\nWe've already calculated that as 25 people out of 50, which is 1/2.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here.\n\nSo, the proportion of the group that has green eyes is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
