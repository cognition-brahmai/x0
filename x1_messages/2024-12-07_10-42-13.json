To finance the project, the league plans to sell naming rights for each stadium at an average price of $20 million per year for 10 years. Additionally, they expect to generate $5 million annually from ticket sales and other events held at each stadium. Determine whether the league can recover its investment within the 10-year naming rights contract period. Provide step-by-step reasoning."

        "content": "So the sports league is planning to build five new stadiums, each with a seating capacity of 50,000 spectators, and each costing $300 million to construct. That means the total cost for building all five stadiums would be 5 times $300 million, which is $1.5 billion.\n\nNow, to finance this project, they have two main sources of income: naming rights and annual revenues from ticket sales and other events.\n\nFirst, let's look at the naming rights. They plan to sell naming rights for each stadium at an average price of $20 million per year for a period of 10 years. So, for each stadium, the naming rights would bring in $20 million per year for 10 years, which is $200 million per stadium.\n\nSince there are five stadiums, the total revenue from naming rights over 10 years would be 5 times $200 million, which is $1 billion.\n\nNext, they expect to generate $5 million annually from ticket sales and other events at each stadium. Over 10 years, for each stadium, that would be $5 million per year times 10 years, which equals $50 million per stadium.\n\nFor five stadiums, that would be 5 times $50 million, which is $250 million.\n\nNow, let's add up the total expected revenue from both naming rights and other annual revenues.\n\nTotal revenue from naming rights: $1 billion\n\nTotal revenue from ticket sales and other events: $250 million\n\nSo, the total expected revenue over 10 years is $1 billion plus $250 million, which equals $1.25 billion.\n\nComparing this to the total construction cost of $1.5 billion, it seems that $1.25 billion is less than $1.5 billion. Therefore, at first glance, it appears that the league cannot recover its investment within the 10-year naming rights contract period.\n\nHowever, maybe there are other factors to consider. Perhaps the naming rights contracts are longer than 10 years, or maybe there are additional revenue streams not mentioned here.\n\nBut based on the information provided, with total revenues of $1.25 billion against expenditures of $1.5 billion, there is a shortfall of $250 million.\n\nSo, no, the league cannot fully recover its investment within the 10-year naming rights contract period based on the given figures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No, the league cannot recover its investment within the 10-year naming rights contract period.}} \\]"
