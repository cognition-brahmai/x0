How about we make a \"Chocolate Molten Lava Cake with Salted Caramel Swirl and Espresso Powder\"? Sounds intriguing, right? It combines the classic molten lava cake with a salty caramel twist and an added coffee kick.\n\n### Chocolate Molten Lava Cake with Salted Caramel Swirl and Espresso Powder\n\n#### Ingredients:\n\n**For the Chocolate Cake:**\n\n- 100g unsalted butter\n- 200g dark chocolate (70% cocoa), chopped\n- 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar\n- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n- 3 large eggs\n- 3 large egg yolks\n- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n- 1 tsp espresso powder\n\n**For the Salted Caramel Swirl:**\n\n- 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n- 2 tbsp water\n- 1/4 cup heavy cream\n- 3 tbsp unsalted butter\n- 1/2 tsp flaky sea salt (like Maldon)\n\n**For Serving:**\n\n- Whipped cream\n- Additional flaky sea salt for garnish\n- Fresh berries\n\n#### Preparation Steps:\n\n1. **Preheat your oven** to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Grease four ramekins with butter and place them on a baking sheet.\n\n2. **Make the Chocolate Mixture:**\n   - In a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (making a double boiler), melt the butter and dark chocolate together until smooth. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.\n   - In a separate bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract.\n   - Add the eggs and egg yolks to the sugar mixture and whisk until well combined and slightly thickened.\n   - Fold the egg mixture into the chocolate mixture until fully incorporated.\n   - Sift in the flour and espresso powder, then fold them into the batter until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.\n\n3. **Prepare the Salted Caramel Swirl:**\n   - In a small saucepan, combine the granulated sugar and water. Cook over medium heat without stirring until the sugar dissolves and turns a deep amber color, about 10-12 minutes.\n   - Very carefully add the heavy cream (it will bubble up), then stir in the butter and flaky sea salt until smooth. Let it cool slightly.\n\n4. **Assemble the Cakes:**\n   - Divide the chocolate batter evenly among the prepared ramekins.\n   - Drizzle a teaspoon of the salted caramel sauce into each ramekin and swirl it gently into the batter using a toothpick or knife.\n\n5. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet with the ramekins in the preheated oven and bake for exactly 12 minutes. The cakes should be puffed and slightly cracked on top, with a molten center.\n\n6. **Serve Immediately:** Run a knife around the edge of each ramekin to loosen the cake. Invert onto individual plates, letting the molten chocolate ooze out. Top with a dollop of whipped cream, a sprinkle of flaky sea salt, and some fresh berries.\n\nEnjoy your decadent Chocolate Molten Lava Cakes with a salty caramel swirl and a hint of espresso! This dessert is sure to impress any chocolate lover."
