        "content": "So I need to calculate the present value of a bond that pays $500 every year for 5 years and has a face value of $5,000, and the discount rate is 6%. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this bond is. It's a type of investment where the issuer promises to pay a certain amount of money at regular intervals (in this case, annually) and finally pay back the face value at the end of the bond's term. So, there are two components here: the annual payments and the face value payment at maturity.\n\nThe annual payments are like annuities, and the face value is a single future payment. To find the present value (PV) of the bond, I need to calculate the PV of these cash flows discounted at the given rate of 6%.\n\nLet's start with the annual payments. Each year, the bond pays $500. Since these payments are equal and occur at regular intervals, I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity.\n\nThe formula for the present value of an annuity is:\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{annuity}} = P \\times \\left( \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the annual payment,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate,\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of periods.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n- \\( P = 500 \\),\n\n- \\( r = 0.06 \\),\n\n- \\( n = 5 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{annuity}} = 500 \\times \\left( \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.06)^{-5}}{0.06} \\right) \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (1 + 0.06)^{-5} \\):\n\n\\[ (1.06)^{-5} \\approx 0.7473 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.7473 = 0.2527 \\]\n\nNow, divide by the discount rate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.2527}{0.06} \\approx 4.2117 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by the annual payment:\n\n\\[ 500 \\times 4.2117 = 2105.85 \\]\n\nSo, the present value of the annual payments is approximately $2,105.85.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the present value of the face value payment of $5,000 at the end of 5 years.\n\nThe formula for the present value of a single future payment is:\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{single payment}} = \\frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( FV \\) is the future value,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate,\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of periods.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n- \\( FV = 5000 \\),\n\n- \\( r = 0.06 \\),\n\n- \\( n = 5 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{single payment}} = \\frac{5000}{(1 + 0.06)^5} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (1 + 0.06)^5 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.06)^5 \\approx 1.3382 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ \\frac{5000}{1.3382} \\approx 3736.29 \\]\n\nSo, the present value of the face value payment is approximately $3,736.29.\n\nNow, to find the total present value of the bond, I need to add the present values of the annual payments and the face value payment:\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{total}} = PV_{\\text{annuity}} + PV_{\\text{single payment}} \\]\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{total}} = 2105.85 + 3736.29 = 5842.14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the present value of the bond is approximately $5,842.14.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for the annuity:\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{annuity}} = 500 \\times \\left( \\frac{1 - (1.06)^{-5}}{0.06} \\right) \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1.06)^{-5} \\):\n\n\\[ (1.06)^{-5} = \\frac{1}{(1.06)^5} = \\frac{1}{1.3382} \\approx 0.7473 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.7473 = 0.2527 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.2527}{0.06} \\approx 4.2117 \\]\n\n\\[ 500 \\times 4.2117 = 2105.85 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, for the single payment:\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{single payment}} = \\frac{5000}{1.3382} \\approx 3736.29 \\]\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[ 2105.85 + 3736.29 = 5842.14 \\]\n\nYes, that appears to be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this bond as a series of individual cash flows, each needing to be discounted back to the present.\n\nSo, the cash flows are:\n\n- Year 1: $500\n\n- Year 2: $500\n\n- Year 3: $500\n\n- Year 4: $500\n\n- Year 5: $500 + $5,000 = $5,500\n\nNow, discount each cash flow individually:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{500}{(1.06)^1} + \\frac{500}{(1.06)^2} + \\frac{500}{(1.06)^3} + \\frac{500}{(1.06)^4} + \\frac{5500}{(1.06)^5} \\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\[ \\frac{500}{1.06} \\approx 471.70 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{500}{1.1236} \\approx 445.00 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{500}{1.1910} \\approx 419.81 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{500}{1.2625} \\approx 396.05 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{5500}{1.3382} \\approx 4107.58 \\]\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n\\[ 471.70 + 445.00 = 916.70 \\]\n\n\\[ 916.70 + 419.81 = 1,336.51 \\]\n\n\\[ 1,336.51 + 396.05 = 1,732.56 \\]\n\n\\[ 1,732.56 + 4,107.58 = 5,840.14 \\]\n\nHmm, this total is $5,840.14, which is slightly different from the earlier calculation of $5,842.14. There's a discrepancy of $2.00. This could be due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps.\n\nIn the first method, I calculated the present value of the annuity and the present value of the face value separately and then added them up. In the second method, I treated each cash flow individually. Both methods should theoretically give the same result, but in practice, slight differences can occur due to rounding.\n\nTo minimize rounding errors, it's better to carry more decimal places in intermediate calculations. Let me try recalculating the second method with more precision.\n\nFirst, calculate each discounted cash flow with more decimal places:\n\n\\[ \\frac{500}{1.0600} = 471.698113 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{500}{1.1236} = 445.000000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{500}{1.191016} = 419.811349 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{500}{1.262477} = 396.055000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{5500}{1.338226} = 4107.583000 \\]\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n\\[ 471.698113 + 445.000000 = 916.698113 \\]\n\n\\[ 916.698113 + 419.811349 = 1,336.509462 \\]\n\n\\[ 1,336.509462 + 396.055000 = 1,732.564462 \\]\n\n\\[ 1,732.564462 + 4,107.583000 = 5,840.147462 \\]\n\nSo, with more precise calculations, the total present value is approximately $5,840.15.\n\nNow, comparing this to the first method's result of $5,842.14, the difference is $2.00. This discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the intermediate steps. In practice, such small differences are acceptable, but for the sake of accuracy, it's better to use the more precise method or carry more decimal places in calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a financial calculator or a spreadsheet function to get a more accurate result.\n\nIn Excel, for example, I can use the PV function for the annuity and the PV function for the single payment, or use the PV function considering all cash flows.\n\nUsing Excel's PV function for the annuity:\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{annuity}} = PV(0.06, 5, -500, 0, 0) \\]\n\nThis should give the present value of the annuity.\n\nSimilarly, for the single payment:\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{single payment}} = PV(0.06, 5, 0, -5000, 0) \\]\n\nThen, sum them up to get the total present value.\n\nAlternatively, use the NPV function for all cash flows:\n\n\\[ NPV = NPV(0.06, -500, -500, -500, -500, -5500) \\]\n\nBut actually, the NPV function in Excel is slightly different, as it assumes the first cash flow occurs at the end of the first period. So, it's better to use the PV function for more accuracy in this context.\n\nGiven that, I trust the first method's result of $5,842.14 is more accurate, considering the way the PV function is applied.\n\nTherefore, the present value of the bond is approximately $5,842.14.\n\nTo summarize, I calculated the present value of the bond by separately calculating the present value of the annual coupon payments (an annuity) and the present value of the face value payment at maturity, then summing them up. This approach is standard in bond valuation and provides a reliable estimate of the bond's value given the discount rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5842.14} \\]"
