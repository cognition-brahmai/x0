        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Let's start by creating the first function that counts the occurrences of each unique string in an array.\n\n### Function 1: Counting Unique Strings\n\nWe'll create a function called `countUniqueStrings` that takes an array of strings as input and returns an object where the keys are the unique strings and the values are their counts.\n\nHere's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Initialize an empty object** to store the counts.\n2. **Iterate through the array**:\n   - For each string, check if it already exists as a key in the object.\n   - If it does, increment its count.\n   - If it doesn't, add it to the object with a count of 1.\n\nHere's the code for this function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction countUniqueStrings(arr) {\n    const countObj = {};\n    arr.forEach(str => {\n        if (countObj.hasOwnProperty(str)) {\n            countObj[str]++;\n        } else {\n            countObj[str] = 1;\n        }\n    });\n    return countObj;\n}\n```\n\n### Function 2: Sorting Unique Strings Alphabetically Before Counting\n\nNow, for the second function, we need to sort the unique strings alphabetically before counting them. However, since the final output is an object, and objects in JavaScript do not maintain order (until ES6, where property order is preserved based on insertion), we need to handle this carefully.\n\nTo ensure the keys are sorted alphabetically, we can:\n\n1. **Get unique strings** from the array.\n2. **Sort** these unique strings alphabetically.\n3. **Count** the occurrences of each sorted unique string in the original array.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction countUniqueStringsSorted(arr) {\n    // Get unique strings\n    const uniqueStrings = Array.from(new Set(arr));\n    // Sort the unique strings alphabetically\n    const sortedUniqueStrings = uniqueStrings.sort();\n    // Count occurrences of each sorted unique string\n    const countObj = {};\n    sortedUniqueStrings.forEach(str => {\n        countObj[str] = arr.filter(s => s === str).length;\n    });\n    return countObj;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function 1 (`countUniqueStrings`)**:\n   - Uses a simple loop to count occurrences without considering any specific order.\n\n2. **Function 2 (`countUniqueStringsSorted`)**:\n   - First, it extracts unique strings using a Set.\n   - Then, it sorts these unique strings alphabetically.\n   - Finally, it counts the occurrences of each sorted unique string in the original array.\n\nThis way, you get the counts of unique strings, with the keys sorted alphabetically in the second function.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
