        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a cube, and an ant starts at one corner, say point A, and wants to get to the diagonally opposite corner, point B. The ant can only walk along the edges of the cube and cannot travel along the same edge more than once. We need to find out how many different paths the ant can take.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the cube and label its corners to keep track of the ant's movement. Let's assign letters to each corner of the cube:\n\n- Let\u2019s say point A is at (0,0,0).\n\n- Then, the adjacent points to A would be:\n\n  - A moving along the x-axis to (1,0,0), let's call this point C.\n\n  - A moving along the y-axis to (0,1,0), let's call this point D.\n\n  - A moving along the z-axis to (0,0,1), let's call this point E.\n\n- The diagonally opposite point B would be at (1,1,1).\n\n- Other points can be labeled similarly:\n\n  - From C, moving along y-axis to (1,1,0), call it F.\n\n  - From C, moving along z-axis to (1,0,1), call it G.\n\n  - From D, moving along z-axis to (0,1,1), call it H.\n\n  - From F, moving along z-axis to (1,1,1), which is B.\n\n  - From G, moving along y-axis to (1,1,1), which is B.\n\n  - From H, moving along x-axis to (1,1,1), which is B.\n\nSo, the cube has 8 corners: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\nNow, the ant starts at A and wants to reach B, moving only along the edges without retracing any edge.\n\nLet me consider the possible paths the ant can take.\n\nSince the ant can move along any of the three edges from A initially, let's explore each of these choices.\n\n**First path: A \u2192 C \u2192 ... \u2192 B**\n\nFrom A, the ant can go to C (along the x-axis).\n\nFrom C, the ant can go to F or G, but not back to A.\n\n- If ant goes C \u2192 F:\n\n  - From F, it can go to B or to H.\n\n    - If F \u2192 B, that's one path: A \u2192 C \u2192 F \u2192 B.\n\n    - If F \u2192 H, then from H it can only go to B (since H is connected to F and B, and it can't go back to F), so A \u2192 C \u2192 F \u2192 H \u2192 B.\n\n- If ant goes C \u2192 G:\n\n  - From G, it can go to B or to H.\n\n    - If G \u2192 B, that's another path: A \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 B.\n\n    - If G \u2192 H, then from H it can go to B or F.\n\n      - If H \u2192 B, then A \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 H \u2192 B.\n\n      - If H \u2192 F, then from F it can go to B, but wait, F is already connected to B, so A \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 H \u2192 F \u2192 B. However, this path includes more edges, and I need to make sure it doesn't retrace any edge.\n\nBut in this case, the ant hasn't retraced any edge, so this is a valid path.\n\nWait, but in the path A \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 H \u2192 F \u2192 B, the ant has traveled from H to F, which is allowed since it hasn't traveled that edge before.\n\nSo, that's another path.\n\n**Second path: A \u2192 D \u2192 ... \u2192 B**\n\nSimilarly, from A, the ant can go to D (along the y-axis).\n\nFrom D, it can go to F or H, but not back to A.\n\n- If ant goes D \u2192 F:\n\n  - From F, it can go to B or to C.\n\n    - If F \u2192 B, then A \u2192 D \u2192 F \u2192 B.\n\n    - If F \u2192 C, then from C it can go to G or back to A, but A is already visited, so C \u2192 G.\n\n      - From G, it can go to B or H.\n\n        - If G \u2192 B, then A \u2192 D \u2192 F \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 B.\n\n        - If G \u2192 H, then H \u2192 B or H \u2192 F, but F is already visited, so H \u2192 B, making the path A \u2192 D \u2192 F \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 H \u2192 B.

H \u2192 B: path A \u2192 C \u2192 F \u2192 H \u2192 B.\n\n  - H \u2192 G: then G \u2192 B, since G is connected to B and C, but C is already visited.\n\n    - So, A \u2192 C \u2192 F \u2192 H \u2192 G \u2192 B.\n\nBut wait, in this path, the ant goes A \u2192 C \u2192 F \u2192 H \u2192 G \u2192 B. That's 5 steps.\n\nIs this within the constraints?\n\nYes, as long as no edge is repeated.\n\nSimilarly, from C to G: 1 way.\n\nFrom G to others: G can go to B or H.\n\n- If G \u2192 B: path A \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 B.\n\n- If G \u2192 H: then H can go to B or F.\n\n  - H \u2192 B: path A \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 H \u2192 B.\n\n  - H \u2192 F: then F \u2192 B or F \u2192 C, but C is already visited, so F \u2192 B, making A \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 H \u2192 F \u2192 B. That's 6 steps.\n\nSo, via C, we have paths of lengths 3, 4, and 5.\n\nSimilarly, via D and E, we'll have analogous paths.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me try to count the total number of paths without worrying about edge repetitions and then subtract the invalid ones.\n\nWait, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or some graph traversal algorithm to count the paths.\n\nAlternatively, since the cube is a small graph, maybe I can use adjacency matrices or some other linear algebra approach.\n\nBut that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nLet me try to think recursively.\n\nDefine the function P(X, B, E), where X is the current position, B is the target, and E is the set of used edges.\n\nBut that seems too general.\n\nAlternatively, define P(X, B, k), where k is the path length.\n\nBut again, it's complicated without a computer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of ways to reach B from A without repeating edges by considering the degrees of freedom at each step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the number of ways to traverse the cube from A to B without repeating edges, which is similar to finding the number of self-avoiding walks from A to B.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in graph theory, but it might not have a simple formula for arbitrary graphs.\n\nHowever, since the cube is a small and regular graph, maybe I can find a pattern or use symmetry to simplify the counting.\n\nLet me try to count the number of paths of different lengths.\n\n**Paths of length 3:**\n\nAs previously determined, there are 6 paths of length 3 from A to B.\n\n**Paths of length 4:**\n\nNow, let's find paths of length 4.\n\nFrom A, in 4 steps, reaching B without repeating edges.\n\nLet me consider the possible sequences.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A \u2192 C \u2192 F \u2192 H \u2192 B\n\n- A \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 H \u2192 B\n\n- A \u2192 C \u2192 G \u2192 F \u2192 B\n\n- A \u2192 D \u2192 F \u2192 H \u2192 B\n\n- A \u2192 D \u2192 H \u2192 G \u2192 B\n\n- A \u2192 D \u2192 H \u2192 F \u2192 B\n\n- A \u2192 E \u2192 G \u2192 C \u2192 B\n\n- A \u2192 E \u2192 G \u2192 H \u2192 B\n\n- A \u2192 E \u2192 H \u2192 G \u2192 B\n\n- A \u2192 E \u2192 H \u2192 D \u2192 B\n\nWait, but some of these might involve repeating edges, so I need to check.\n\nLet's take A \u2192 C \u2192 F \u2192 H \u2192 B:\n\n- Edges: A-C, C-F, F-H, H-B.
