        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of products: A and B. Every day, it produces 400 units of A and 600 units of B. Each unit of A needs 2 hours of labor, and each unit of B needs 3 hours of labor. The factory operates for 10 hours a day. We need to find out how many workers are needed to meet this daily production target.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total labor hours required for producing both products every day.\n\nFor product A:\n\n400 units * 2 hours/unit = 800 hours\n\nFor product B:\n\n600 units * 3 hours/unit = 1800 hours\n\nSo, the total labor hours needed per day are:\n\n800 hours (for A) + 1800 hours (for B) = 2600 hours\n\nNow, the factory operates for 10 hours a day. So, each worker can contribute up to 10 hours per day.\n\nTo find out the number of workers needed, I should divide the total labor hours by the hours each worker can work per day.\n\nNumber of workers = Total labor hours / Hours per worker per day\n\nNumber of workers = 2600 hours / 10 hours/worker/day = 260 workers\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total production requirements in terms of worker-hours.\n\nEach worker can work 10 hours a day. So, one worker can contribute 10 hours to the production.\n\nProduct A requires 800 hours, and product B requires 1800 hours, totaling 2600 hours.\n\nSo, dividing the total required hours by the hours each worker can provide:\n\n2600 hours / 10 hours/worker/day = 260 workers\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if workers are assigned exclusively to one product or if they can switch between producing A and B.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify if workers are specialized for one product or if they can work on both.\n\nIf workers can switch between products, then the total labor hours required are still 2600 hours, and the factory operates for 10 hours a day.\n\nSo, the calculation remains the same: 2600 hours / 10 hours/worker/day = 260 workers.\n\nIf workers are specialized, meaning some only work on A and others only on B, then:\n\nFor product A:\n\n800 hours / 10 hours/worker/day = 80 workers\n\nFor product B:\n\n1800 hours / 10 hours/worker/day = 180 workers\n\nTotal workers = 80 (for A) + 180 (for B) = 260 workers\n\nAgain, the same number.\n\nSo, whether workers are multi-skilled or specialized, the total number of workers needed is 260.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to consider. Maybe there are efficiency factors or breaks that reduce the effective working hours per day.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the factory operates for 10 hours a day, so presumably, workers are working during that time.\n\nUnless there's overtime or partial utilization of workers, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 260 workers.\n\nWait, but let's think about it in another way. Maybe the factory can have workers who work on both products during the day.\n\nFor example, a worker could spend some hours on A and some on B.\n\nBut in terms of total labor hours required, it's still 2600 hours, so dividing by 10 hours per worker per day gives 260 workers.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory has a certain number of workers who work full time, and they need to allocate their time between A and B to meet the production targets.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and the problem seems straightforward.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is 260 workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{260} \\]"
