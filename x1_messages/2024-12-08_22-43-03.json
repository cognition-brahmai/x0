        "content": "Let's calculate the company's monthly payroll expense step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many hours each employee works in a week. They work 8 hours a day for 5 days, so that's:\n\n8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week\n\nNext, we'll calculate their weekly salary. Since they're paid $25 per hour, each employee earns:\n\n40 hours/week * $25/hour = $1,000/week\n\nNow, to find the monthly payroll expense, we need to know how many weeks are in a month. Typically, a month has about 4 weeks, so:\n\n$1,000/week * 4 weeks/month = $4,000/month per employee\n\nBut wait, some months have more than 4 weeks. To be more accurate, we can consider that there are approximately 4.33 weeks in a month (since 52 weeks/year \u00f7 12 months/year \u2248 4.33 weeks/month). So, using this more precise figure:\n\n$1,000/week * 4.33 weeks/month = $4,330/month per employee\n\nNow, the company has 20 employees, so the total monthly payroll expense would be:\n\n$4,330/month/employee * 20 employees = $86,600/month\n\nAlternatively, if we consider a month to have exactly 4 weeks, the total would be:\n\n$4,000/month/employee * 20 employees = $80,000/month\n\nBut using the more accurate weeks per month figure, $86,600 seems more precise.\n\nHowever, another way to approach this is to calculate the annual payroll and then divide by 12 to get the monthly expense.\n\nFirst, calculate the annual hours worked by one employee:\n\n40 hours/week * 52 weeks/year = 2,080 hours/year\n\nThen, their annual salary would be:\n\n2,080 hours/year * $25/hour = $52,000/year\n\nFor 20 employees, the total annual payroll is:\n\n$52,000/year/employee * 20 employees = $1,040,000/year\n\nNow, to find the monthly payroll expense:\n\n$1,040,000/year \u00f7 12 months/year \u2248 $86,666.67/month\n\nThis is very close to our earlier estimate of $86,600/month, confirming that our initial calculation was reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that some months have more or fewer days, we could calculate based on the actual number of days in a month.\n\nAssuming a standard 30-day month, each employee works:\n\n8 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 hours/month\n\nBut since months have varying lengths, this might not be accurate. Alternatively, calculate the daily wage and then multiply by the number of days in the month.\n\nDaily wage:\n\n8 hours/day * $25/hour = $200/day\n\nFor a 30-day month:\n\n$200/day * 30 days/month = $6,000/month per employee\n\nThen for 20 employees:\n\n$6,000/month/employee * 20 employees = $120,000/month\n\nWait, this is significantly higher than our previous estimates. There must be a mistake here.\n\nAh, the problem is that not every day in a month is a workday. They only work 5 days a week, which is typically less than 30 days in a month.\n\nAssuming a 30-day month, there are about 4 weeks, which would be 20 workdays (5 days/week * 4 weeks).\n\nSo, the correct calculation would be:\n\n$200/day * 20 days/month = $4,000/month per employee\n\nThen for 20 employees:\n\n$4,000/month/employee * 20 employees = $80,000/month\n\nThis matches our earlier estimate using 4 weeks per month.\n\nHowever, using the more precise 4.33 weeks per month figure seems more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate based on the actual number of workdays in a month.\n\nAssuming an average of 21 workdays per month (since there are about 20.83 workdays in a month, considering 52 weeks/year * 5 days/week \u00f7 12 months/year \u2248 21 days/month), then:\n\n$200/day * 21 days/month = $4,200/month per employee\n\nFor 20 employees:\n\n$4,200/month/employee * 20 employees = $84,000/month\n\nThis is between our previous estimates of $80,000 and $86,600.\n\nGiven these various methods, it seems that the monthly payroll expense is approximately $84,000 to $86,600.\n\nConsidering the annual calculation gives us $86,666.67/month, which is likely the most accurate, as it accounts for the exact number of work hours in a year.\n\nTherefore, the company's monthly payroll expense is approximately $86,666.67.\n\nHowever, to be precise, we should consider that not all months have exactly the same number of workdays, and there might be holidays or other factors affecting the actual hours worked.\n\nBut based on the given information, assuming standard 5-day workweeks and 4.33 weeks per month, the monthly payroll expense is about $86,666.67.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{86666.67} \\]"
