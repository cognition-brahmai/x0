Creating a simple ATM machine using Java and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles is a great way to understand concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. Let's break down the task into smaller parts to make it manageable.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the main components of an ATM system. Typically, an ATM has functionalities like checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and perhaps transferring funds. For simplicity, let's focus on the first three: balance check, deposit, and withdrawal.\n\n### Step 1: Designing the Class Structure\n\nWe'll start by designing a class that represents a Bank Account. This class will hold the balance and methods to perform operations like deposit and withdrawal.\n\n#### BankAccount Class\n\n- **Attributes:**\n\n  - `balance`: to store the current balance.\n\n- **Methods:**\n\n  - `getBalance()`: to retrieve the current balance.\n\n  - `deposit(double amount)`: to add money to the balance.\n\n  - `withdraw(double amount)`: to subtract money from the balance.\n\n### Step 2: Implementing the BankAccount Class\n\nNow, let's write the code for the BankAccount class.\n\n```java\npublic class BankAccount {\n    private double balance;\n\n    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {\n        this.balance = initialBalance;\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n            System.out.println(\"Deposited: $\" + amount);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid amount\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {\n            balance -= amount;\n            System.out.println(\"Withdrew: $\" + amount);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid amount or insufficient funds\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Creating the ATM Class\n\nNext, we'll create an ATM class that will interact with the BankAccount object. This class will handle user inputs and call the appropriate methods on the BankAccount object.\n\n#### ATM Class\n\n- **Attributes:**\n\n  - `account`: an instance of BankAccount.\n\n- **Methods:**\n\n  - `run()`: to simulate the ATM operations.\n\n  - `displayMenu()`: to show the available options to the user.\n\n  - `processChoice(int choice)`: to handle the user's choice.\n\n### Step 4: Implementing the ATM Class\n\nLet's write the code for the ATM class.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class ATM {\n    private BankAccount account;\n    private Scanner scanner;\n\n    public ATM(double initialBalance) {\n        this.account = new BankAccount(initialBalance);\n        this.scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n    }\n\n    public void run() {\n        int choice;\n        do {\n            displayMenu();\n            choice = scanner.nextInt();\n            processChoice(choice);\n        } while (choice != 4);\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n\n    private void displayMenu() {\n        System.out.println(\"\\nATM Menu:\");\n        System.out.println(\"1. Check Balance\");\n        System.out.println(\"2. Deposit\");\n        System.out.println(\"3. Withdraw\");\n        System.out.println(\"4. Exit\");\n        System.out.print(\"Enter your choice: \");\n    }\n\n    private void processChoice(int choice) {\n        switch (choice) {\n            case 1:\n                checkBalance();\n                break;\n            case 2:\n                deposit();\n                break;\n            case 3:\n                withdraw();\n                break;\n            case 4:\n                System.out.println(\"Thank you for using the ATM. Goodbye!\");\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void checkBalance() {\n        System.out.println(\"Your balance is: $\" + account.getBalance());\n    }\n\n    private void deposit() {\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the amount to deposit: $\");\n        double amount = scanner.nextDouble();\n        account.deposit(amount);\n    }\n\n    private void withdraw() {\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the amount to withdraw: $\");\n        double amount = scanner.nextDouble();\n        account.withdraw(amount);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        ATM atm = new ATM(100.0); // Starting balance of $100\n        atm.run();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **BankAccount Class:**\n   - Encapsulates the balance and provides methods to deposit and withdraw money.\n   - Uses private access modifier for balance to ensure it can only be modified through the defined methods.\n\n2. **ATM Class:**\n   - Manages the interaction with the user.\n   - Displays a menu and processes the user's choices.\n   - Uses a Scanner to read user inputs.\n\n3. **Main Method:**\n   - Initializes the ATM with an initial balance and starts the ATM simulation.\n\nThis simple ATM program demonstrates basic OOP principles in Java, including class creation, encapsulation, and method implementation. You can expand upon this by adding more features like transaction history, multiple accounts, or even a simple user authentication system."
