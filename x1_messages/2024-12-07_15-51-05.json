        "content": "So I've got this problem about planning a sports complex. The total area is 50 acres, and different parts of it are allocated for different facilities. The stadium takes up 30% of the space, the swimming pool occupies 20%, and the remaining area is for tennis courts and other amenities. I need to figure out how many tennis courts can be built if each one requires 0.5 acres of land.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have the total area of the complex, which is 50 acres. Out of this, certain percentages are allocated to the stadium and the swimming pool. The rest is for tennis courts and other amenities. I need to find out how much area is left for tennis courts and then see how many courts can be built, given that each court needs 0.5 acres.\n\nLet me start by calculating the area occupied by the stadium. The stadium takes up 30% of the total area. So, I can find that by multiplying 50 acres by 30%.\n\nArea of stadium = 50 acres * 30% = 50 * 0.30 = 15 acres\n\nNext, the swimming pool occupies 20% of the total area.\n\nArea of swimming pool = 50 acres * 20% = 50 * 0.20 = 10 acres\n\nNow, to find the remaining area for tennis courts and other amenities, I need to subtract the areas of the stadium and the swimming pool from the total area.\n\nRemaining area = Total area - (Area of stadium + Area of swimming pool) = 50 - (15 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25 acres\n\nSo, there are 25 acres left for tennis courts and other amenities.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of tennis courts that can be built, and each court requires 0.5 acres. Assuming that the entire remaining area is used for tennis courts (although it mentions \"other amenities\" as well), I'll proceed with the 25 acres for tennis courts.\n\nNumber of tennis courts = Remaining area / Area per court = 25 acres / 0.5 acres per court = 50 courts\n\nWait a minute, but the remaining area is allocated for both tennis courts and other amenities. The problem doesn't specify how much of the remaining area is for tennis courts specifically. It just says \"the remaining area allocated for tennis courts and other amenities.\"\n\nThis introduces some uncertainty because not all of the remaining 25 acres might be used for tennis courts. If some of it is used for other amenities, then the number of tennis courts would be less.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide specific details about the allocation between tennis courts and other amenities, I might have to assume that all the remaining area is used for tennis courts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"other amenities\" are included in the tennis courts, but that doesn't make much sense. Maybe \"other amenities\" are separate from the tennis courts, meaning that the 25 acres is shared between tennis courts and other things.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the most straightforward approach is to assume that the remaining 25 acres are entirely allocated to tennis courts.\n\nTherefore, number of tennis courts = 25 acres / 0.5 acres per court = 50 courts\n\nBut I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, are there any pathways, landscaping, or parking areas within the remaining 25 acres that might reduce the area available for tennis courts?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any such deductions, so I'll proceed with the initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"other amenities\" already account for pathways, landscaping, etc., and the remaining area is exclusively for tennis courts. But again, without specific information, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with my initial calculation.\n\nNumber of tennis courts = 25 acres / 0.5 acres per court = 50 courts\n\nWait, but let's double-check the area calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal area = 50 acres\n\nStadium = 30% of 50 = 0.30 * 50 = 15 acres\n\nSwimming pool = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 acres\n\nRemaining area = 50 - (15 + 10) = 25 acres\n\nArea per tennis court = 0.5 acres\n\nNumber of courts = 25 / 0.5 = 50\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentages are not based on the total area but on other factors. However, the problem states that the stadium takes up 30% of the space, and the swimming pool occupies 20%, which I interpreted as percentages of the total area.\n\nIf there's any other interpretation, it's not immediately obvious.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 50 tennis courts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
