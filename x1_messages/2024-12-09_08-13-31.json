        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 8 red balls and 12 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 20 balls. I need to pick three balls without looking, and I want to find the probability of picking exactly two red balls and one blue ball.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how to calculate probabilities in situations like this. Since I'm picking balls without replacement, the events are dependent, meaning the outcome of one pick affects the outcomes of the others. But instead of getting bogged down in calculating dependent probabilities step by step, I think it's easier to use combinations here.\n\nCombinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here. I'm only concerned with the number of red and blue balls I pick, not the order in which I pick them.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick 3 balls out of 20 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{20}{3}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick exactly 2 red balls out of 8 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to pick 2 red} = \\binom{8}{2}\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to pick 1 blue ball out of 12 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to pick 1 blue} = \\binom{12}{1}\n\\]\n\nSince these are independent choices (picking red and picking blue), I can multiply these two to get the number of favorable outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = \\binom{8}{2} \\times \\binom{12}{1}\n\\]\n\nThen, the probability is the ratio of favorable ways to total ways:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 2 red and 1 blue}) = \\frac{\\binom{8}{2} \\times \\binom{12}{1}}{\\binom{20}{3}}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate these combinations. Let's start with \\(\\binom{20}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{3} = \\frac{20!}{3!(20-3)!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{6840}{6} = 1140\n\\]\n\nNext, \\(\\binom{8}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(\\binom{12}{1}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{1} = \\frac{12!}{1!(12-1)!} = \\frac{12}{1} = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply the favorable ways:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = 28 \\times 12 = 336\n\\]\n\nFinally, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{336}{1140}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{336 \\div 12}{1140 \\div 12} = \\frac{28}{95}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of picking exactly two red balls and one blue ball is \\(\\frac{28}{95}\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can also calculate it using probabilities step by step to verify.\n\nFirst pick: probability of picking a red ball is \\(\\frac{8}{20}\\).\n\nSecond pick: now there are 7 red and 12 blue left, so probability of picking another red is \\(\\frac{7}{19}\\).\n\nThird pick: now 6 red and 12 blue left, probability of picking a blue is \\(\\frac{12}{18} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (red, red, blue) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{20} \\times \\frac{7}{19} \\times \\frac{12}{18} = \\frac{8}{20} \\times \\frac{7}{19} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 2}{20 \\times 19 \\times 3} = \\frac{112}{1140} = \\frac{28}{285}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, this is just for one specific order. Since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all the possible orders in which I can pick two reds and one blue.\n\nThe possible sequences are: RRB, RBR, BRR.\n\nEach of these has the same probability, so I can multiply the probability of one sequence by the number of sequences.\n\nNumber of sequences is 3 (RRB, RBR, BRR).\n\nSo, total probability is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times \\frac{28}{285} = \\frac{84}{285} = \\frac{28}{95}\n\\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could have considered the general formula for hypergeometric distribution, which deals with sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X=k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\times \\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(N\\) is the population size (20 balls),\n\n- \\(K\\) is the number of success states in the population (8 red balls),\n\n- \\(n\\) is the number of draws (3 balls),\n\n- \\(k\\) is the number of observed successes (2 red balls).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(X=2) = \\frac{\\binom{8}{2} \\times \\binom{12}{1}}{\\binom{20}{3}} = \\frac{28 \\times 12}{1140} = \\frac{336}{1140} = \\frac{28}{95}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that \\(\\frac{28}{95}\\) is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{28}{95}} \\]"
