        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the composition of the class in terms of boys and girls.\n\nGiven that there are 30 students in total and twice as many boys as girls, I can set up an equation to find out how many boys and girls there are.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\nB = 2G (twice as many boys as girls)\n\nAnd:\n\nB + G = 30 (total students)\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n\n2G + G = 30\n\n3G = 30\n\nG = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 girls.\n\nThen, B = 2 * 10 = 20 boys.\n\nAlright, so the class has 20 boys and 10 girls.\n\nNow, the teacher divides the class into groups of 5 students each. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen group has exactly 3 boys and 2 girls.\n\nTo find this probability, I should use combinations because the order in which the students are chosen doesn't matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of possible groups of 5 students that can be formed from 30 students. This is C(30, 5).\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5! * 25!) = (30*29*28*27*26) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 142506\n\nSo, there are 142,506 possible groups of 5 students.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of groups that have exactly 3 boys and 2 girls.\n\nTo have exactly 3 boys in a group, I need to choose 3 boys out of 20. That's C(20, 3).\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3! * 17!) = (20*19*18) / (3*2*1) = 1140\n\nSimilarly, to have exactly 2 girls in a group, I need to choose 2 girls out of 10. That's C(10, 2).\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10*9) / (2*1) = 45\n\nNow, since these are independent choices (choosing boys and choosing girls), the total number of groups with exactly 3 boys and 2 girls is the product of these two combinations.\n\nSo, total favorable groups = C(20, 3) * C(10, 2) = 1140 * 45 = 51300\n\nFinally, the probability is the number of favorable groups divided by the total number of possible groups.\n\nProbability = favorable groups / total groups = 51300 / 142506\n\nLet's simplify this fraction.\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n51300 / 6 = 8550\n\n142506 / 6 = 23751\n\nSo, 8550 / 23751\n\nI can check if this can be simplified further. Let's see if both numbers are divisible by 3.\n\n8550 \u00f7 3 = 2850\n\n23751 \u00f7 3 = 7917\n\nSo, 2850 / 7917\n\nAgain, divisible by 3:\n\n2850 \u00f7 3 = 950\n\n7917 \u00f7 3 = 2639\n\nNow, 950 / 2639\n\nLet's check if both are divisible by 5:\n\n950 \u00f7 5 = 190\n\n2639 \u00f7 5 = 527.8, which is not an integer.\n\nSo, 950 and 2639 have no common factors other than 1, meaning 950/2639 is the simplified form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 950/2639.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n950 \u00f7 2639 \u2248 0.3597\n\nSo, approximately 0.3597, or 35.97%.\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly chosen group will have exactly 3 boys and 2 girls is about 35.97%, or in fraction form, 950/2639.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{950}{2639}} \\]"
