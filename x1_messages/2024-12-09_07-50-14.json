        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see: there's a bag with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 5 green balls. I need to find the probability of drawing two red balls in a row without replacing the first one back into the bag. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the bag. There are 4 red, 3 blue, and 5 green, so total balls are 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing the first red ball. Since there are 4 red balls out of 12 total balls, the probability is 4/12, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNext, without replacing the first ball, I need to draw a second red ball. After drawing one red ball, there are now 3 red balls left and the total number of balls is now 11, since we didn't replace the first one.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing the second red ball is 3/11.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening in sequence (drawing two red balls in a row without replacement), I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability is (1/3) * (3/11).\n\nLet's calculate that: (1/3) * (3/11) = (1*3)/(3*11) = 3/33 = 1/11.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two red balls in a row without replacement is 1/11.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use combinations. The total number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 4 is C(4,2), and the total number of ways to draw any 2 balls out of 12 is C(12,2).\n\nThe probability would then be C(4,2) / C(12,2).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nC(4,2) = (4!)/(2!(4-2)!) = (4*3*2*1)/(2*1*(2*1)) = (24)/(4) = 6.\n\nC(12,2) = (12!)/(2!(12-2)!) = (12*11*10!)/(2*1*10!)/(10!) = (12*11)/(2) = 66.\n\nSo, probability is 6/66 = 1/11.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the probability of selecting 2 red balls without replacement.\n\nThe first draw: probability is 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nSecond draw: since one red is already taken, probability is 3/11.\n\nMultiply them: (1/3)*(3/11) = 1/11.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any dependency or any conditional probability I need to consider here?\n\nWell, since it's without replacement, the second draw depends on the first, which I've already accounted for by adjusting the numbers after the first draw.\n\nAlso, the balls are presumably well mixed, and each ball is equally likely to be drawn.\n\nNo other factors seem to be involved here.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 1/11 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{11}} \\]"
