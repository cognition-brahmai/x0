He was an influential American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement, particularly known for his unique drip painting technique. His approach involved dripping or pouring paint onto the canvas, often laid out on the floor, which resulted in dynamic and abstract compositions. Pollock's innovative methods challenged traditional notions of painting and had a significant impact on the art world."
