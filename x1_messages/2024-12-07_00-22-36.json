Here's a function in Python that checks if a given number is prime:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it immediately returns `False` since prime numbers are greater than 1. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it finds any divisor, it returns `False`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number."
