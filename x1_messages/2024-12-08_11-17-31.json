Listen to Governor Hickenlooper yesterday morning speaking with Candy Crowley from \"STATE OF THE UNION.\" GOVERNOR JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), COLORADA: It sort of felt like I was in a -- caught in a nightmare I couldn\\'t wake up from, right? All these things kept happening. People that I loved they didn\\'t seem to be connected in any way. To me the emotional toll has been much deeper than worrying about security. SPELLMAN: Investigators hope to have final confirmation of the ballistics from Texas and the Tom Clements shooting to confirm that link. But the investigation will be far from over until they figure out his motive and if he worked with anyone else -- John, Christine. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: All right, Jim Spellman. Thanks, Jim. We could find out today how a powerful Russian businessman died. An autopsy is set for later this morning for 67-year-old Boris Berezovsky. He was found dead Saturday in his London area home. Berezovsky was living in England after a falling-out with the Kremlin. He was a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and that has led to a lot of speculation about his death. British investigators say they wouldn\\'t found any evidence of third-party involvement. He was found locked inside his bathroom. The door locked from the inside. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: A group sky dive taking a tragic turn. An instructor and student from Iceland found dead in a wooded area in Zephyr Hills, Florida outside Tampa. Investigators say neither of them attempted to deploy their main parachutes. They may have somehow lost their altitude awareness. Their back up chutes activated automatically, but apparently too late to save them. An extraordinary tale of survival by a 9-year-old girl after a horrifying accident that killed her father, the California Highway Patrol says she was with him in an SUV when it left California\\'s remote Sierra Highway and rolled hundreds of feet down an embankment. The girl who had only cuts and bruises escaped and ran up the hill in complete darkness to a nearby house. No one answered. So what she did she went and checked on her dad again then climbed 200 feet up a steep embankment where a passerby found her and called for help. JOE GOMEZ, LIVES IN THE AREA: It\\'s mind boggling that a little girl at that stage could do something like that. She\\'s a survivor. BERMAN: The father, as we said, did not survive. The girl says they were returning home to Los Angeles after a party. Investigators are saying that alcohol played a role in the crash. ROMANS: And here\\'s something you don\\'t see every day. The driver was heading down a hill near Los Angeles and couldn\\'t stop. That\\'s when the Cadillac rounded a corner, went airborne and landed on this roof. GALINA WYNN, PASSENGER: We took the corner the back air bag deployed and I don\\'t even see where we\\'re going from there, because the view was obstructed and I just heard when we stop I could see myself and my husband\\'s really, really lucky. ROMANS: A neighbor used a ladder to help get the couple down. It took a crane to get the Cadillac down. Authorities say there was a man inside the house, but he wasn\\'t hurt. Best headline, Cadillac on a hot tin roof. Same-sex marriage front and center this week with the Supreme Court taking up two appeals beginning tomorrow. The first Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio is already on record saying he supports it. Now listen to Karl Rove answer a question from ABC\\'s George Stephanopoulos about it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you imagine the next presidential campaign, a Republican candidate saying flat-out I am for gay marriage? KARL ROVE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I could. BERMAN: Rove quickly changed the subject after that. This is interesting for a variety of reasons. First of all, in 2004 when he was the architect for George W. Bush, you know, legend has it that Rove tried to drive a wedge issue on the issue of same-sex marriage, of course, coming out against it at that point. Now he says the Republicans could actually have a candidate who supports it, though, let\\'s put the question to Connie Mack, Mary Bono Mack, what do you think, possible? CONNIE MACK, FORMER FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN: Well, I certainly this issue -- I said this weekend to some friends that it\\'s not a matter of if. It\\'s a matter of when and how. And I think really we\\'re starting to see the debate more about definition. So when you talk about marriage, marriage is a religious institution that I think we ought to protect and marriage should be between one man and one woman. But I also believe that we ought to afford the same rights and privileges to people who love each other and want to have a family with each other. They ought to be allowed to do that and get all the same rights. MARY BONO MACK, FORMER CALIFORNIA CONGRESSWOMAN: In California, we\\'ve had Prop 8, which started, people didn\\'t know could they or couldn\\'t they marry their loved one. I\\'ve seen it my neighborhood. You know, in my family certainly. I think Senator Portman\\'s credit, when you have someone like this in your family it takes on a whole different meaning to you and you\\'re willing to come out and be brave and say something this brave. So in my instance I have a lot of, you know, great dear friends who are gay and they\\'re married and I support it. BERMAN: When someone says, like Karl Rove says it\\'s possible, though, does that carry weight among Republican candidates? Does that open up the door for someone to perhaps now say they support same-sex marriage? MARY BONO MACK: I believe it does. Absolutely, look I believe it opens the door for people to take risks and to sort of step away from the orthodoxy. And not only Karl -- I know my husband\\'s going to disagree with me. He\\'s leaning over to give me the hook. But you know, it opens the door, I think, for people to step away from -- CONNIE MACK: I don\\'t think it\\'s that simple. I mean, just because that\\'s Karl Rove\\'s feeling doesn\\'t necessarily mean that candidates across the country now are going to say, well, if Karl Rove said it, then we\\'re going to start moving in that direction. RICHARD SOCARIDES, WRITER, NEWYORKER.COM: This issue is moving so fast. Public opinion on this issue is moving so fast. And right here we have the two faces of the Republican Party, the more modern face, and the still evolving face of the Republican Party. MARY BONO MACK: I\\'m more modern. SOCARIDES: I will go right here and go further than Karl Rove went and tell you that I think if public opinion continues to move as quickly as it has recently, in four years from now, I guarantee you that this will not be an issue in the presidential race, and both parties will have candidates that support marriage equality. MARY BONO MACK: And it shouldn\\'t be an issue, shouldn\\'t be an issue. BERMAN: All right, guys, it\\'s 36 minutes after the hour right now. Convicted child sex abuser Jerry Sandusky speaking out for the first time since he was sent to prison in the Penn State child sex abuse case. This morning a documentary filmmaker is playing excerpts from phone conversations that he recorded with Sandusky. The filmmaker is appearing on NBC\\'s \"Today\" show. CNN\\'s Sara Ganim joins us now with more. Good morning, Sara. SARA GANIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, John. You know, this guy, John Ziegler, he\\'s a documentary filmmaker out west. He kind of does this thing where he attaches to big stories. He did it with Sarah Palin several years ago. He did it a little bit with Steubenville rape case a couple of weeks ago and he also did it with Joe Paterno story. His agenda, according to his web site is very clear. He is trying to clear Joe Paterno\\'s name. But, he\\'s doing it this time with an interview with -- the jailhouse interview with Jerry Sandusky who we all know is a convicted child sex predator and the family is very upset at what he\\'s doing. Sources tell me that it\\'s an interesting case because he actually had some Paterno followers on Twitter. He was raising some money to do a documentary to help exonerate Joe Paterno and the family has said look, we don\\'t support this. We don\\'t support using, you know, having Jerry Sandusky basically speak for Joe Paterno from jail and Jerry Sandusky is clearly not that credible at this point. BERMAN: All right, Sara Ganim, thanks for joining us right now. We want to bring in Tom Kline. He represents Sandusky victim number five. He was present for the entire Sandusky case from the preliminary hearing to the verdict. And Tom, let me ask you right now, what do you make of Sandusky speaking from prison in these recordings that are being played this morning? TOM KLINE, REPRESENTS SANDUSKY\\'S VICTIM NUMBER 5: Well, to whom he\\'s speaking is interesting. Sandusky and a Paterno advocate are certainly odd bedfellows. Mr. Paterno certainly was complicit, and there certainly were major problems with his conduct. Mr. Sandusky was the root of all of these problems, and Mr. Sandusky is now saying the same old thing that he has said over and over and over again. He is a convicted felon, and he\\'s going to spend the rest of his life in jail. That\\'s the reality here. ROMANS: So what\\'s the motive behind Sandusky cooperating with this documentary, and for allowing himself to be taped behind bars and allowing these conversations to be aired? What does he gain? KLINE: Mr. Sandusky has always looked for a friendly forum. Most interesting part of the Sandusky trial, as far as he was concerned, was his lawyer explaining to the jury at the very end in the closing argument that Mr. Sandusky didn\\'t take the stand because he didn\\'t need to face the prosecutor in cross-examination because he faced the most -- the toughest prosecutor in the world in Bob Costas, which, of course, is all silliness. He looks and he seeks for attention. He\\'s narcissistic. He can\\'t accept his punishment and he\\'s looking to tell his story again. He\\'s looking to tell it in a friendly forum and I\\'m sure he was convinced that this would be a friendly forum. ROMANS: How does that make the victims feel? KLINE: Terrible. Enough is enough. My client insisted that he testify at the sentencing hearing, which he did. He faced Mr. Sandusky, and he told him all of the things that he did to ruin his life. I am quite sure that every victim feels the same way. BERMAN: Tom, do you think he\\'ll admit some of the things he says right now against him if you take this to civil court try to get some money out of it. Will this help you anything he says from behind bars? KLINE: Nothing Mr. Sandusky says or doesn\\'t say is going to affect the civil lawsuits in my opinion. He, as a convicted felon and in fact, Mr. Paterno\\'s family and Mr. Paterno back when blamed Mr. Sandusky. Penn State blamed Mr. Sandusky. Everyone believes that he is the root cause of this problem. There\\'s no controversy about that. The only issue remaining is Penn State\\'s complicity. Penn State\\'s enabling Mr. Sandusky to do what he did. That\\'s what\\'s on the table in the civil cases. ROMANS: So, so one of the, one of the pieces of sound from Jerry Sandusky in this interview that was aired on NBC where Jerry Sandusky essentially saying he doesn\\'t understand how somebody could have walked into the shower room, Mike McQueary and -- and jumped to the conclusions that he did about what was going on in there. I mean, he\\'s really attacking the McQueary witness, and also that whole episode that really turned the stomachs of the jury. KLINE: I was there. I saw Mike McQueary testify with conviction, and without a doubt he was believed by the jury. He told a compelling, compelling story. And I don\\'t understand how Mr. Sandusky doesn\\'t understand that Mr. McQueary saw what Mr. Sandusky had repeated over and over again in the shower room with little boys. He saw it. He -- he told people about it. Mr. McQueary did and the facts were the facts. So Mr. Sandusky now saying, I don\\'t understand what Mr. McQueary saw, well it was evident in the courtroom what he saw, with clear conviction, and without any doubt, at least to my credibility, having been a trial lawyer for 35 years. ROMANS: You know what do you make of the Paterno family so quickly saying that they don\\'t endorse this documentary? They don\\'t endorse any of this, you know, that they, the truth will be the truth, not, not this, or, or any other, even the Louis Freeh report. What do you make of that? KLINE: Well, it\\'s very interesting. Mr. Ziegler\\'s had this web site up for a long time, which is, you know, called the lies about Joe Paterno or something like that. The fact of the matter is that I haven\\'t heard them discredit him previously. He now gets discredited when he gets into bed, if you will, with Mr. Sandusky. Then they want to set some distance. Of course, the Paterno family wants to set distance from Mr. Sandusky. He is a convicted felon, and he was the root cause. The problem the Paternos have is that Mr. Paterno in the documents that we all have, and that have been aired in public by Mr. Louis Freeh, clearly shows that Joe Paterno was complicit in this whole, sordid, ugly affair. BERMAN: All right, Tom Kline, attorney for victim number five. Thank you for coming in and talking to us about this, this morning. KLINE: My pleasure. BERMAN: -- Jerry Sandusky speaking for the first time by phone from behind bars everyone hearing tape of that for the first time this morning. It\\'s 42 minutes after the hour right now. Tonight, the man behind that documentary I\\'m just telling you about John Ziegler will be on \"PIERS MORGAN LIVE.\" You want to watch that.
