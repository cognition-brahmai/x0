        "content": "So I've got this math problem here: 3(5)^2 - 4(7) + 9 / 3. Hmm, let's see how to approach this. I remember that when evaluating expressions, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nFirst, I look for parentheses. There are none in this expression, so I can move on to exponents. I see that there's an exponent here: 5 squared. So, 5^2 is 25. Now, the expression becomes 3*25 - 4*7 + 9/3.\n\nNext, I need to handle the multiplication and division from left to right. So, first, 3 multiplied by 25 is 75. Then, 4 multiplied by 7 is 28. And finally, 9 divided by 3 is 3. Now, the expression simplifies to 75 - 28 + 3.\n\nNow, I just need to perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 75 minus 28 is 47, and then 47 plus 3 is 50.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
