        "content": "So I've got this line integral to evaluate: the integral of F dotted with dr, where F is the vector field F(x, y) = x i + y j, and C is a curve parametrized by r(t) = t i + t\u00b2 j for t going from 0 to 1. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a line integral of a vector field along a curve is. It's essentially the work done by the field F on a particle moving along the curve C. The formula for this is:\n\n\u222bC F \u22c5 dr = \u222ba^b F(r(t)) \u22c5 r'(t) dt\n\nWhere:\n\n- r(t) is the parametrization of the curve C,\n\n- F(r(t)) is the vector field evaluated at the point r(t),\n\n- r'(t) is the derivative of r(t) with respect to t,\n\n- and the integral is taken over the parameter t from a to b.\n\nSo, in this problem:\n\nF(x, y) = x i + y j\n\nr(t) = t i + t\u00b2 j, for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1\n\nFirst, I need to find F(r(t)). Since r(t) = t i + t\u00b2 j, that means x = t and y = t\u00b2. Plugging these into F:\n\nF(r(t)) = t i + t\u00b2 j\n\nNext, I need to find r'(t), the derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'(t) = d/dt (t i + t\u00b2 j) = 1 i + 2t j\n\nNow, I need to compute the dot product F(r(t)) \u22c5 r'(t):\n\nF(r(t)) \u22c5 r'(t) = (t i + t\u00b2 j) \u22c5 (1 i + 2t j) = t*1 + t\u00b2*2t = t + 2t\u00b3\n\nSo, the integrand is t + 2t\u00b3.\n\nNow, I need to integrate this from t = 0 to t = 1:\n\n\u222b(t + 2t\u00b3) dt from 0 to 1\n\nLet's compute this integral:\n\n\u222bt dt + \u222b2t\u00b3 dt from 0 to 1\n\nThe integral of t is (1/2)t\u00b2, and the integral of 2t\u00b3 is (2/4)t\u2074 = (1/2)t\u2074.\n\nSo, evaluating from 0 to 1:\n\n[(1/2)(1)\u00b2 + (1/2)(1)^4] - [(1/2)(0)^2 + (1/2)(0)^4] = (1/2 + 1/2) - (0 + 0) = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nTherefore, the value of the line integral is 1.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to compute line integrals is to parameterize the curve and express everything in terms of the parameter. Which is basically what I just did.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for line integrals in terms of x and y:\n\n\u222bC F \u22c5 dr = \u222bC P dx + Q dy\n\nWhere F = P i + Q j, so here P = x and Q = y.\n\nGiven that x = t and y = t\u00b2, and dx/dt = 1, dy/dt = 2t, and dt ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, \u222bC P dx + Q dy = \u222bC x dx + y dy\n\nSubstituting x = t, y = t\u00b2, dx = dt, dy = 2t dt:\n\n\u222b (t dt + t\u00b2 * 2t dt) from t=0 to t=1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\u222b (t + 2t\u00b3) dt from 0 to 1\n\nWhich is the same integral I had before, and it evaluates to 1.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nIs there another way to check this? Maybe by considering the potential function, if F is conservative.\n\nLet's see, for F = x i + y j, the partial derivatives are:\n\n\u2202P/\u2202y = 0 and \u2202Q/\u2202x = 0\n\nSince \u2202P/\u2202y = \u2202Q/\u2202x, the vector field F is conservative, meaning there exists a potential function \u03c6 such that F = \u2207\u03c6.\n\nLet's find \u03c6.\n\nAssume \u03c6(x, y) such that:\n\n\u2202\u03c6/\u2202x = x\n\n\u2202\u03c6/\u2202y = y\n\nIntegrate the first equation with respect to x:\n\n\u03c6(x, y) = (1/2)x\u00b2 + g(y)\n\nNow, take the partial with respect to y:\n\n\u2202\u03c6/\u2202y = g'(y) = y\n\nSo, g(y) = (1/2)y\u00b2 + C\n\nTherefore, \u03c6(x, y) = (1/2)x\u00b2 + (1/2)y\u00b2 + C\n\nSince line integrals of conservative vector fields depend only on the endpoints, I can compute \u03c6(end point) - \u03c6(start point).\n\nGiven that C is parametrized by r(t) = t i + t\u00b2 j from t=0 to t=1, the start point is (0,0) and the end point is (1,1).\n\nSo, \u03c6(1,1) - \u03c6(0,0) = [(1/2)(1)^2 + (1/2)(1)^2 + C] - [(1/2)(0)^2 + (1/2)(0)^2 + C] = (1/2 + 1/2 + C) - (0 + 0 + C) = 1 + C - C = 1\n\nAgain, this matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 1 as the answer.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the line integral is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
