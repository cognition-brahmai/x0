        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a farmer with chickens and rabbits in his farmyard. He counted 40 heads and 112 legs in total. We need to figure out how many chickens and how many rabbits there are.\n\nFirst, I think we should recall some basic facts about chickens and rabbits. Chickens have 2 legs each, and rabbits have 4 legs each. Also, each animal has one head.\n\nSo, if there are 40 heads, that means there are 40 animals in total, right? Now, we need to find out how many of these are chickens and how many are rabbits.\n\nLet's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of rabbits as R.\n\nFrom the information given, we can set up two equations.\n\nThe first equation will be based on the number of heads:\n\nC + R = 40\n\nThe second equation will be based on the number of legs:\n\n2C + 4R = 112\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of C and R.\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for C:\n\nC = 40 - R\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for C into the second equation:\n\n2(40 - R) + 4R = 112\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n80 - 2R + 4R = 112\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n80 + 2R = 112\n\nNow, subtract 80 from both sides:\n\n2R = 32\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nR = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 rabbits.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for C:\n\nC = 40 - 16 = 24\n\nTherefore, there are 24 chickens and 16 rabbits.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. Chickens have 2 legs each, so 24 chickens would have 48 legs. Rabbits have 4 legs each, so 16 rabbits would have 64 legs. Adding those up: 48 + 64 = 112 legs, which matches the total given. Also, 24 + 16 = 40 heads, which also matches.\n\nSo, the answer should be 24 chickens and 16 rabbits.\n\nWait a minute, but the question asks for the number of chickens and rabbits, and we've found that there are 24 chickens and 16 rabbits. Is there anything else we need to consider here?\n\nI think that's it. It's a straightforward problem in systems of equations. As long as we set up the equations correctly and solve them accurately, we should be good.\n\nLet me think about another way to approach this. Maybe there's a simpler method without using algebra.\n\nSuppose we assume that all 40 animals are chickens. Then, we would have 40 * 2 = 80 legs in total. But the actual number of legs is 112, which is 32 legs more than 80.\n\nNow, each rabbit has 2 more legs than a chicken. So, the difference of 32 legs must be due to the rabbits.\n\nTherefore, the number of rabbits is 32 / 2 = 16.\n\nThen, the number of chickens is 40 - 16 = 24.\n\nThis matches our previous result. So, regardless of the method, we arrive at the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we assumed all animals are rabbits, we would have 40 * 4 = 160 legs. But the actual number is 112, which is 48 legs less than 160.\n\nEach chicken has 2 legs fewer than a rabbit, so the difference of 48 legs would mean there are 48 / 2 = 24 chickens.\n\nThen, the number of rabbits would be 40 - 24 = 16.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter how we approach it, the answer remains consistent: 24 chickens and 16 rabbits.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24 \\text{ chickens and } 16 \\text{ rabbits}} \\]"
