        "content": "That's a great question! Let's see, I know that the Vice President is the second-in-command to the President of the United States and plays a crucial role in the government. Now, thinking about the early days of the United States, there were several vice presidents who served under different presidents. But the one who served under both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison... hmm.\n\nThomas Jefferson was the third president, serving from 1801 to 1809, and James Madison was the fourth president, serving from 1809 to 1817. So, the vice president who served under both of them must have been in office during overlapping terms of these two presidents.\n\nLet me recall, Jefferson had two vice presidents during his two terms. In his first term, from 1801 to 1805, his vice president was Aaron Burr. But Aaron Burr didn't serve in the second term. In Jefferson's second term, from 1805 to 1809, his vice president was George Clinton.\n\nThen, when James Madison took office in 1809, George Clinton continued as vice president until his death in 1812. After that, Elbridge Gerry served as vice president from 1813 to 1814.\n\nSo, George Clinton served as vice president under both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. That makes him the only person in U.S. history to serve under two different presidents.\n\nTo confirm, let's look at the timeline:\n\n- Thomas Jefferson: 1801-1809\n\n- Vice President: Aaron Burr (1801-1805), George Clinton (1805-1809)\n\n- James Madison: 1809-1817\n\n- Vice President: George Clinton (1809-1812), Elbridge Gerry (1813-1814)\n\nYes, George Clinton is the one who served under both Jefferson and Madison.\n\nIt's interesting to note that George Clinton had a long political career. He was also the governor of New York for many years before becoming vice president. He was a key figure in the early years of the United States and played an important role in the Democratic-Republican Party.\n\nSo, to answer your question, George Clinton is the only person in U.S. history to serve as vice president under two different presidents: Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{George Clinton}} \\]"
