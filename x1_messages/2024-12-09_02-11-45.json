        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Pascal's triangle is a fascinating mathematical structure where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. The first few rows look like this:\n\n```\n\nRow 0: 1\n\nRow 1: 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 2 1\n\nRow 3: 1 3 3 1\n\nRow 4: 1 4 6 4 1\n\n...\n\n```\n\nTo implement a function that prints the first n rows of Pascal's triangle in Python, we can use a nested list to build each row based on the previous one. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialize the triangle**: Start with an empty list that will hold each row of the triangle.\n\n2. **Build each row**:\n   - For each row number `i` from 0 to n-1:\n     - Create a new row that starts with 1.\n     - For each position `j` from 1 to i:\n       - If `j` is 0 or `j` is equal to `i`, the value is 1.\n       - Otherwise, the value is the sum of the elements at positions `j-1` and `j` in the previous row.\n     - Append this row to the triangle list.\n\n3. **Print the triangle**: Iterate through each row and print it.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef print_pascals_triangle(n):\n    triangle = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        row = [1]  # Start each row with 1\n        if i > 0:\n            prev_row = triangle[i-1]\n            for j in range(1, i):\n                value = prev_row[j-1] + prev_row[j]\n                row.append(value)\n            row.append(1)  # End each row with 1\n        triangle.append(row)\n    \n    # Print the triangle\n    for row in triangle:\n        print(' '.join(str(num) for num in row).center(n*2))\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 5\nprint_pascals_triangle(n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start with an empty list `triangle` to store each row.\n2. **Building Rows**:\n   - For each row index `i` from 0 to n-1:\n     - We initialize the row with 1.\n     - If `i` is greater than 0, we calculate the middle values by summing the two values from the previous row.\n     - We append another 1 at the end of the row.\n     - We append this row to the `triangle` list.\n3. **Printing**:\n   - We iterate through each row in `triangle` and print it, centered for better visualization.\n\nThis function will print the first n rows of Pascal's triangle in a nicely formatted way. You can adjust the spacing or formatting as needed for your specific use case."
