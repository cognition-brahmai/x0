        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. Creating a random password with specific criteria is a common task, and Python has several libraries that make this straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Import necessary libraries**: We'll use the `random` module to generate random characters and the `string` module to get sets of characters like uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.\n\n2. **Define the character sets**: We'll create variables for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.\n\n3. **Ensure inclusion of each type**: To make sure the password includes at least one character from each category, we'll select one character from each set and then fill the remaining password length with a random selection from all these sets combined.\n\n4. **Shuffle the password**: After creating the password, we'll shuffle it to ensure that the required characters are not always in the same positions.\n\n5. **Generate and print the password**: Finally, we'll generate the password and print it.\n\nHere's a sample Python script that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(length=12):\n    if length < 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"Password length should be at least 4 to include all required character types.\")\n    \n    # Define character sets\n    uppercase = string.ascii_uppercase\n    lowercase = string.ascii_lowercase\n    digits = string.digits\n    special = string.punctuation\n    \n    # Select one character from each set\n    upper = random.choice(uppercase)\n    lower = random.choice(lowercase)\n    digit = random.choice(digits)\n    special_char = random.choice(special)\n    \n    # Combine the selected characters\n    password = [upper, lower, digit, special_char]\n    \n    # Fill the remaining length with a random selection from all sets\n    all_chars = uppercase + lowercase + digits + special\n    remaining_length = length - 4\n    for _ in range(remaining_length):\n        password.append(random.choice(all_chars))\n    \n    # Shuffle the password list to ensure randomness\n    random.shuffle(password)\n    \n    # Convert list to string and return\n    return ''.join(password)\n\n# Generate and print the password\nprint(generate_password(12))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Step 1**: Import the `random` and `string` modules.\n- **Step 2**: Define the character sets using `string` module constants.\n- **Step 3**: Select one character from each set to ensure inclusion.\n- **Step 4**: Combine these characters and fill the rest of the password length with random choices from all sets.\n- **Step 5**: Shuffle the list of characters to mix them up and then join them into a string.\n\nThis script will generate a random password of the specified length (default is 12 characters) that includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character."
