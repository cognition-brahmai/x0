        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two trains: one leaving Station A at 6:00 PM and arriving at Station B at 10:00 PM, and the other leaving Station B at 7:00 PM and arriving at Station A at 11:00 PM. We need to find out when they cross each other.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the travel times for each train.\n\nTrain 1:\n\n- Leaves A at 6:00 PM\n\n- Arrives at B at 10:00 PM\n\n- Travel time: 4 hours\n\nTrain 2:\n\n- Leaves B at 7:00 PM\n\n- Arrives at A at 11:00 PM\n\n- Travel time: 4 hours\n\nHmm, both trains take the same amount of time to cover the distance between A and B, which is 4 hours. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, we need to find out when these two trains cross each other. To do that, I think we need to consider their speeds and the time they've been traveling when they meet.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Station A and Station B is D kilometers.\n\nThen, the speed of Train 1 is:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nSpeed of Train 1 (S1) = D / 4 km/h\n\nSimilarly, the speed of Train 2 (S2) = D / 4 km/h\n\nWait a minute, both trains have the same speed since they take the same time to cover the same distance. That's interesting.\n\nNow, let's think about the time difference in their departures.\n\nTrain 1 leaves at 6:00 PM, and Train 2 leaves at 7:00 PM, which is one hour later.\n\nSo, by the time Train 2 leaves, Train 1 has already been traveling for one hour.\n\nIn that one hour, Train 1 would have covered:\n\nDistance covered by Train 1 in 1 hour = S1 * 1 = (D/4) * 1 = D/4 km\n\nSo, the remaining distance between the two trains at 7:00 PM is:\n\nD - D/4 = 3D/4 km\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their speeds:\n\nRelative speed = S1 + S2 = D/4 + D/4 = D/2 km/h\n\nNow, time taken to cover the remaining distance between them:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed = (3D/4) / (D/2) = (3D/4) * (2/D) = 3/2 = 1.5 hours\n\nSo, they will cross each other 1.5 hours after Train 2 leaves Station B, which is at 7:00 PM.\n\nTherefore, the time they cross each other is:\n\n7:00 PM + 1 hour 30 minutes = 8:30 PM\n\nWait, but let me double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the position of each train at any given time.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system where Station A is at position 0, and Station B is at position D.\n\nLet\u2019s define t as the time in hours after 6:00 PM.\n\nSo, the position of Train 1 at time t is:\n\nPosition 1 = S1 * t = (D/4) * t\n\nTrain 2 leaves at 7:00 PM, which is t = 1 hour.\n\nSo, the position of Train 2 at time t (where t >= 1) is:\n\nPosition 2 = D - S2 * (t - 1) = D - (D/4) * (t - 1)\n\nThey cross each other when Position 1 = Position 2\n\nSo:\n\n(D/4) * t = D - (D/4) * (t - 1)\n\nLet\u2019s solve for t:\n\n(D/4) * t = D - (D/4) * (t - 1)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate D (assuming D != 0):\n\nt = 4 - (t - 1)\n\nt = 4 - t + 1\n\nt = 5 - t\n\nAdd t to both sides:\n\n2t = 5\n\nt = 2.5 hours\n\nSo, they cross each other at t = 2.5 hours after 6:00 PM.\n\nWhich is 6:00 PM + 2 hours 30 minutes = 8:30 PM\n\nOkay, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of relative speed again to confirm.\n\nTrain 1 has a head start of 1 hour, covering D/4 km.\n\nRemaining distance at 7:00 PM is 3D/4 km.\n\nRelative speed is D/2 km/h, as calculated before.\n\nTime to cover 3D/4 km at D/2 km/h is 1.5 hours, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the trains cross each other at 8:30 PM.\n\nBut wait, let's think about it differently. Maybe using the concept of time and distance more directly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time after 7:00 PM as t hours.\n\nSo, Train 2 has been traveling for t hours, and Train 1 has been traveling for t + 1 hours (since it left an hour earlier).\n\nThe distance covered by Train 1 in (t + 1) hours is S1*(t + 1) = (D/4)*(t + 1)\n\nThe distance covered by Train 2 in t hours is S2*t = (D/4)*t\n\nThe sum of these distances should be equal to the total distance D when they meet.\n\nSo:\n\n(D/4)*(t + 1) + (D/4)*t = D\n\nFactor out D/4:\n\n(D/4)*(t + 1 + t) = D\n\nSimplify:\n\n(D/4)*(2t + 1) = D\n\nDivide both sides by D (assuming D != 0):\n\n(1/4)*(2t + 1) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n2t + 1 = 4\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n2t = 3\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nt = 1.5 hours\n\nSo, again, t = 1.5 hours after 7:00 PM, which is 8:30 PM.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I am confident that the trains cross each other at 8:30 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8:30 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
