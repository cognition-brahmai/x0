        "content": "Sure! I can help you design a TypeScript class for a \"Vehicle\" with the specified properties and methods. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to define the class with the properties: make, model, year, and mileage. These properties will store the relevant information about the vehicle.\n\nNext, we need to implement methods to calculate the vehicle's fuel efficiency and estimated remaining lifespan.\n\nFor fuel efficiency, we'll assume that we have a method that takes the amount of fuel consumed and the distance traveled to calculate miles per gallon (MPG). The formula for MPG is:\n\n\\[ \\text{MPG} = \\frac{\\text{miles driven}}{\\text{gallons of fuel used}} \\]\n\nFor the estimated remaining lifespan, we'll need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the average lifespan of a vehicle is around 200,000 miles. We can then estimate the remaining lifespan based on the current mileage.\n\nHere's how we can structure the class:\n\n1. **Properties:**\n   - make: string\n   - model: string\n   - year: number\n   - mileage: number\n\n2. **Methods:**\n   - calculateFuelEfficiency(milesDriven: number, gallonsUsed: number): number\n   - estimateRemainingLifespan(): number\n\nLet's write the TypeScript code for this class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to design a TypeScript class representing a vehicle with properties such as make, model, year, and mileage. We also need to implement methods to calculate the vehicle's fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon) and estimate its remaining lifespan based on current mileage.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Class Definition:**\n   - Define a class named `Vehicle` with properties for make, model, year, and mileage.\n\n2. **Methods:**\n   - `calculateFuelEfficiency(milesDriven: number, gallonsUsed: number): number`: This method calculates the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{MPG} = \\frac{\\text{miles driven}}{\\text{gallons of fuel used}}\n     \\]\n   - `estimateRemainingLifespan(): number`: This method estimates the remaining lifespan of the vehicle assuming an average lifespan of 200,000 miles:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Lifespan} = 200,000 - \\text{current mileage}\n     \\]\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```typescript\nclass Vehicle {\n    make: string;\n    model: string;\n    year: number;\n    mileage: number;\n\n    constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number, mileage: number) {\n        this.make = make;\n        this.model = model;\n        this.year = year;\n        this.mileage = mileage;\n    }\n\n    calculateFuelEfficiency(milesDriven: number, gallonsUsed: number): number {\n        if (gallonsUsed <= 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Gallons used must be greater than zero.\");\n        }\n        return milesDriven / gallonsUsed;\n    }\n\n    estimateRemainingLifespan(): number {\n        const averageLifespan = 200000;\n        return averageLifespan - this.mileage;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst myCar = new Vehicle(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2015, 50000);\nconsole.log(myCar.calculateFuelEfficiency(300, 10)); // Should return 30 MPG\nconsole.log(myCar.estimateRemainingLifespan()); // Should return 150000 miles\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Class Properties:**\n   - `make`, `model`, `year`, and `mileage` are initialized in the constructor.\n\n2. **calculateFuelEfficiency Method:**\n   - Takes `milesDriven` and `gallonsUsed` as parameters.\n   - Checks if `gallonsUsed` is greater than zero to avoid division by zero.\n   - Returns the calculated MPG.\n\n3. **estimateRemainingLifespan Method:**\n   - Assumes an average vehicle lifespan of 200,000 miles.\n   - Subtracts the current mileage from the average lifespan to estimate remaining miles.\n\nThis class provides a straightforward way to manage vehicle data and perform basic calculations related to its efficiency and lifespan."
