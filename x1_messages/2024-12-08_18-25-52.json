        "content": "So, the problem says that there are 4 times as many pigeons as people in a city, and there are 20,000 people. I need to find out how many pigeons there are. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"4 times as many pigeons as people\" means. If there are 4 times more pigeons than people, that means for every person, there are 4 pigeons. So, if there's one person, there are 4 pigeons; if there are two people, there are 8 pigeons, and so on.\n\nNow, given that there are 20,000 people, I can calculate the number of pigeons by multiplying the number of people by 4. That should give me the total number of pigeons in the city.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of pigeons = 4 \u00d7 number of people\n\nNumber of people = 20,000\n\nSo, Number of pigeons = 4 \u00d7 20,000\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication.\n\n4 \u00d7 20,000\n\nWell, 4 times 20 is 80, and since there are three zeros in 20,000, I need to add three zeros to 80.\n\nSo, 4 \u00d7 20,000 = 80,000\n\nTherefore, there are 80,000 pigeons in the city.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf there are 20,000 people and there are 4 times as many pigeons, then yes, multiplying 20,000 by 4 gives 80,000 pigeons.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nNumber of pigeons = 4 \u00d7 number of people\n\nPlugging in the number of people:\n\nNumber of pigeons = 4 \u00d7 20,000 = 80,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can approach it differently. If I consider the ratio of pigeons to people is 4:1, meaning for every 1 person, there are 4 pigeons.\n\nSo, for 20,000 people, the number of pigeons would be 4 multiplied by 20,000, which again is 80,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation.\n\nLet P be the number of people, and G be the number of pigeons.\n\nGiven that G = 4P\n\nAnd P = 20,000\n\nSo, G = 4 \u00d7 20,000 = 80,000\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80000} \\]"
