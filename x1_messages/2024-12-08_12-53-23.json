        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 3 meters and a height of 4 meters, and I need to find out its volume in cubic meters. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst things first, I need to remember the formula for the volume of a cylinder. I think it's something like the area of the base times the height. Yeah, that sounds right. For a cylinder, the base is a circle, so the area of the base would be the area of that circle.\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the circle. And the volume of the cylinder would then be V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nOkay, so I have the diameter of the tank, which is 3 meters. The radius is half of the diameter, right? So, r = 3/2 = 1.5 meters.\n\nNow, the height h is given as 4 meters.\n\nPlugging these values into the volume formula, I get:\n\nV = \u03c0 * (1.5)\u00b2 * 4\n\nLet me calculate (1.5)\u00b2 first. 1.5 times 1.5 is 2.25.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * 2.25 * 4\n\nNow, 2.25 times 4 is 9.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * 9\n\nNow, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so:\n\nV \u2248 3.1416 * 9 \u2248 28.2744 cubic meters.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if there's a more precise way to do this, or if I've missed anything.\n\nLet me see, the formula seems straightforward: V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nI have r = 1.5 meters, h = 4 meters.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the area of the base first.\n\nArea of the base, A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*(1.5)\u00b2 = \u03c0*2.25.\n\nThen, volume V = A*h = \u03c0*2.25*4 = \u03c0*9, which is what I have.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, V \u2248 28.2744 cubic meters.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the units. The diameter and height are given in meters, so the volume should indeed be in cubic meters.\n\nAlso, perhaps I should consider the precision of my answer. The given values are 3 meters and 4 meters, which seem to be given to one significant figure, but since 3 meters could be a precise measurement, maybe I should keep more decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should leave the answer in terms of \u03c0, especially since the problem doesn't specify to use a particular approximation for \u03c0.\n\nSo, V = 9\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\nThat's exact, without approximating \u03c0.\n\nBut if I need a numerical value, then using \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, V \u2248 28.2744 cubic meters.\n\nAlternatively, using \u03c0 \u2248 22/7, V \u2248 22/7 * 9 \u2248 198/7 \u2248 28.2857 cubic meters.\n\nHmm, slightly different from the previous approximation, but close enough for most practical purposes.\n\nI think for this problem, providing both the exact value in terms of \u03c0 and the approximate numerical value would be helpful.\n\nSo, the volume of the tank is exactly 9\u03c0 cubic meters, or approximately 28.27 cubic meters.\n\nWait, actually, 3.1416 * 9 is 28.2744, which rounds to 28.27 cubic meters when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut perhaps I should check if there's a standard formula or if I've missed any steps.\n\nLet me recall, volume of a cylinder is indeed V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nI have the correct values for r and h, and I've plugged them in correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of the circumference or something, but no, for volume, this is the appropriate formula.\n\nAnother way to think about the area of the base is to use the diameter, but since the formula requires the radius, it's straightforward to convert diameter to radius.\n\nAlternatively, the area of the base can be expressed as \u03c0(d/2)\u00b2, where d is the diameter.\n\nSo, A = \u03c0(3/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0(1.5)\u00b2 = \u03c0*2.25, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nTherefore, the volume is indeed 9\u03c0 cubic meters, or approximately 28.27 cubic meters.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9\\pi \\text{ cubic meters} \\approx 28.27 \\text{ cubic meters}} \\]"
