According to most anatomy textbooks, the human body contains around 640 skeletal muscles. However, the exact number can vary slightly depending on how different muscles are classified and counted. It's also important to note that there are other types of muscles in the body, such as smooth muscles and cardiac muscles, which are not included in this count."
