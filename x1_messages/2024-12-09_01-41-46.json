        "content": "Sure! Here's a simple JavaScript function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence:\n\n```javascript\nfunction capitalizeFirstLetter(sentence) {\n    return sentence.toLowerCase().replace(/(^|\\s)\\S/g, function(letter) {\n        return letter.toUpperCase();\n    });\n}\n```\n\nLet me explain how this works:\n\n1. **Convert to Lowercase:** First, the entire sentence is converted to lowercase using `toLowerCase()`. This ensures that even if the sentence already has some uppercase letters, we start with a consistent case.\n\n2. **Regular Expression:** The `replace()` function is used with a regular expression `/(^|\\s)\\S/g`. Let's break this down:\n   - `(^|\\s)`: This matches either the start of the string (`^`) or any whitespace character (`\\s`).\n   - `\\S`: This matches any non-whitespace character, effectively the first letter of each word.\n\n3. **Callback Function:** For each match found by the regular expression, the callback function `function(letter) { return letter.toUpperCase(); }` is invoked. This function takes the matched letter and converts it to uppercase.\n\nSo, when you pass a sentence to this function, it will return a new string where the first letter of each word is capitalized, and the rest of the letters are in lowercase.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```javascript\nlet sentence = \"hello world, this is an EXAMPLE.\";\nconsole.log(capitalizeFirstLetter(sentence));\n// Output: \"Hello World, This Is An Example.\"\n```\n\nThis function handles punctuation correctly and ensures that only the first letter of each word is capitalized."
