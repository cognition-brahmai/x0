        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in a room. 60% of them are wearing glasses. So, first I need to find out how many people are wearing glasses.\n\nTo find 60% of 100, I can calculate:\n\n60% \u00d7 100 = 0.60 \u00d7 100 = 60\n\nSo, 60 people are wearing glasses.\n\nNow, out of these 60 people wearing glasses, 40% also wear hats. I need to find out how many that is.\n\nTo find 40% of 60, I can calculate:\n\n40% \u00d7 60 = 0.40 \u00d7 60 = 24\n\nTherefore, 24 people are wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal people = 100\n\nPercentage wearing glasses = 60%\n\nNumber wearing glasses = 60% of 100 = 60\n\nPercentage of glass wearers also wearing hats = 40%\n\nNumber wearing both = 40% of 60 = 24\n\nYes, that seems straightforward. I don't think there's any need to consider overlapping percentages or anything like that, because the question is specifically about those who wear both glasses and hats, and it's given as a percentage of those who wear glasses.\n\nSo, the answer should be 24 people are wearing both glasses and hats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
