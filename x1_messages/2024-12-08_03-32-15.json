        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains: one leaving Town A going towards Town B at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaving Town B going towards Town A at 80 miles per hour. The distance between the towns is 420 miles. I need to find out how far apart they will be when they pass each other.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"pass each other\" means. I think it means the point in time when the two trains have traveled such that the sum of their distances traveled equals the total distance between the towns. Wait, no. Actually, when they pass each other, they would have covered the entire distance between the towns together, right? So, the sum of the distances they've each traveled would equal 420 miles.\n\nBut the question is asking for how far apart they are when they pass each other. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. If they pass each other, aren't they at the same point, so the distance apart would be zero?\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's a trick question, and the answer is zero miles because when they pass each other, they are at the same point.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's more to it. Maybe the question is trying to ask something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the distance each train has traveled when they pass each other, or perhaps the time it takes for them to pass each other.\n\nWait, let's look at the question again: \"How far apart will the trains be when they pass each other?\"\n\nIf they pass each other, they must be at the same point, so the distance between them should be zero. But maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the term \"pass each other.\" In train problems, sometimes \"pass each other\" means they go by each other quickly, but still, at that instant, they are at the same point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is poorly worded, and it actually intends to ask how far each train has traveled when they meet.\n\nAssuming that's the case, I can proceed to calculate the distances each train has traveled when they meet.\n\nSo, let's calculate the time it takes for the two trains to meet.\n\nThe train from Town A is going at 60 mph, and the train from Town B is going at 80 mph. Since they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nThe distance between the towns is 420 miles, so the time it takes for them to meet is the distance divided by their relative speed: 420 miles / 140 mph = 3 hours.\n\nSo, they will meet after 3 hours.\n\nNow, to find out how far each train has traveled in that time:\n\n- The train from Town A: 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\n- The train from Town B: 80 mph * 3 hours = 240 miles.\n\nSo, when they meet, the train from Town A has traveled 180 miles, and the train from Town B has traveled 240 miles. Since they've covered the entire 420 miles between them, the sum is 180 + 240 = 420 miles.\n\nBut again, the question is about how far apart they are when they pass each other. If they've covered the entire distance between the towns, then they should be at the same point, meaning the distance between them is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the distance from one town to the meeting point.\n\nFor example, the distance from Town A to the meeting point is 180 miles, and from Town B to the meeting point is 240 miles.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for \"how far apart\" the trains are when they pass each other, which should be zero miles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"pass each other\" refers to the instant they meet, and the question is actually asking for the distance between them at that instant, which is zero.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the distance between the trains at the moment they pass each other, considering their lengths or something. But nothing is mentioned about the lengths of the trains, so that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the distance between the points where each train started and where they pass each other, but that would be the distances we've already calculated: 180 miles and 240 miles.\n\nBut again, the question seems to be asking for the distance between the trains when they pass each other, which should be zero.\n\nPerhaps the question is misphrased, and it's intended to ask something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question to test attention to detail, and the answer is indeed zero miles.\n\nIn that case, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
