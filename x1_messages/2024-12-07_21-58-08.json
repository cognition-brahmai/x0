        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a Python script that connects to a MySQL database using the `pymysql` library, retrieves data from a table named \"employees\" with columns \"id\", \"name\", \"salary\", and \"department\", and calculates the average salary for each department. Finally, it will print the results to the console.\n\nFirst, make sure you have the `pymysql` library installed. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pymysql\n```\n\nNow, let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Connect to the MySQL Database\n\nYou need to establish a connection to your MySQL database. For this, you'll need the following details:\n\n- Hostname\n- Username\n- Password\n- Database name\n\nHere's a sample code to connect to the database:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\n\n# Database connection parameters\nhost = 'your_hostname'\nuser = 'your_username'\npassword = 'your_password'\ndatabase = 'your_database'\n\n# Connect to the database\nconnection = pymysql.connect(host=host,\n                             user=user,\n                             password=password,\n                             database=database)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'your_hostname'`, `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and `'your_database'` with your actual database credentials.\n\n### Step 2: Retrieve Data from the \"employees\" Table\n\nOnce connected, you can retrieve data from the \"employees\" table. You'll need to execute a SQL query to fetch the required columns.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n        # SQL query to select all columns from employees\n        sql = \"SELECT id, name, salary, department FROM employees\"\n        cursor.execute(sql)\n        employees = cursor.fetchall()\nfinally:\n    connection.close()\n```\n\nThis code executes the SQL query and fetches all the rows from the \"employees\" table.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Average Salary for Each Department\n\nTo calculate the average salary for each department, you can use a dictionary to group salaries by department and then compute the average.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\ndepartment_salaries = {}\n\nfor employee in employees:\n    department = employee[3]  # Assuming department is the fourth column\n    salary = employee[2]     # Assuming salary is the third column\n    \n    if department in department_salaries:\n        department_salaries[department].append(salary)\n    else:\n        department_salaries[department] = [salary]\n\n# Calculate average salary for each department\naverage_salaries = {}\nfor department, salaries in department_salaries.items():\n    average_salaries[department] = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)\n```\n\nThis code groups salaries by department and then calculates the average salary for each department.\n\n### Step 4: Print the Results\n\nFinally, print the average salaries for each department.\n\n```python\nfor department, avg_salary in average_salaries.items():\n    print(f\"Department: {department}, Average Salary: {avg_salary}\")\n```\n\n### Complete Script\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete Python script:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\n\n# Database connection parameters\nhost = 'your_hostname'\nuser = 'your_username'\npassword = 'your_password'\ndatabase = 'your_database'\n\ntry:\n    # Connect to the database\n    connection = pymysql.connect(host=host,\n                                 user=user,\n                                 password=password,\n                                 database=database)\n    \n    with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n        # SQL query to select all columns from employees\n        sql = \"SELECT id, name, salary, department FROM employees\"\n        cursor.execute(sql)\n        employees = cursor.fetchall()\n        \n        department_salaries = {}\n        for employee in employees:\n            department = employee[3]  # Assuming department is the fourth column\n            salary = employee[2]     # Assuming salary is the third column\n            \n            if department in department_salaries:\n                department_salaries[department].append(salary)\n            else:\n                department_salaries[department] = [salary]\n        \n        # Calculate average salary for each department\n        average_salaries = {}\n        for department, salaries in department_salaries.items():\n            average_salaries[department] = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)\n        \n        # Print the results\n        for department, avg_salary in average_salaries.items():\n            print(f\"Department: {department}, Average Salary: {avg_salary}\")\nfinally:\n    connection.close()\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholder values for the database connection parameters with your actual database credentials.\n\nThis script connects to the MySQL database, retrieves the employees' data, calculates the average salary for each department, and prints the results to the console."
