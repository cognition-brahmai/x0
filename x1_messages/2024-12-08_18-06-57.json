        "content": "Let's try to figure this out step by step. So, we have two buses: one leaving from Station A every 30 minutes and taking an hour to reach Station B, and another leaving from Station B every 45 minutes and taking an hour to reach Station A. Both leave at 9 AM, and we need to find out when they'll meet for the first time.\n\nFirst, let's understand their schedules.\n\nBus from A:\n\n- Departs every 30 minutes.\n\n- Takes 1 hour to reach B.\n\nSo, departure times from A are: 9:00, 9:30, 10:00, 10:30, etc.\n\nBus from B:\n\n- Departs every 45 minutes.\n\n- Takes 1 hour to reach A.\n\nDeparture times from B are: 9:00, 9:45, 10:30, 11:15, etc.\n\nNow, they both leave at 9:00 AM. So, the first bus from A is on the road from 9:00 to 10:00, and the first bus from B is on the road from 9:00 to 10:00.\n\nDo they meet during this time?\n\nWell, both are on the road from 9:00 to 10:00, but they are moving towards each other. So, they should meet at some point during this hour.\n\nBut let's think about their speeds.\n\nAssuming the distance between A and B is D.\n\nSpeed of bus from A: D per 60 minutes.\n\nSpeed of bus from B: D per 60 minutes.\n\nSo, both are moving at the same speed.\n\nNow, if they start at the same time and move towards each other, the time to meet should be when the sum of the distances they've traveled equals D.\n\nLet\u2019s denote t as the time in minutes after 9:00 AM when they meet.\n\nDistance traveled by bus from A in t minutes: (D/60)*t\n\nDistance traveled by bus from B in t minutes: (D/60)*t\n\nSo, (D/60)*t + (D/60)*t = D\n\n=> (2D/60)*t = D\n\n=> (D/30)*t = D\n\n=> t = 30 minutes.\n\nSo, they should meet at 9:30 AM.\n\nWait, but there are subsequent buses leaving at different times. Does that affect this meeting time?\n\nWell, the question seems to be about the first buses that leave at 9:00 AM from both stations.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nIf both buses leave at 9:00 AM and meet at 9:30 AM, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach: think in terms of relative speed.\n\nSince both are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.\n\nSpeed of A: D/60 per minute\n\nSpeed of B: D/60 per minute\n\nRelative speed: D/60 + D/60 = D/30 per minute\n\nTime to meet: D / (D/30) = 30 minutes.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo, they meet at 9:30 AM.\n\nBut the question says: \"when will they meet each other for the first time?\"\n\nGiven that, and considering only the first buses leaving at 9:00 AM, it seems that 9:30 AM is the answer.\n\nHowever, perhaps there is more to it, considering the periodic departure of buses.\n\nWait, maybe we need to consider that multiple buses are on the road at the same time due to the periodic departures.\n\nBut the question seems to be about the first buses leaving at 9:00 AM from both stations.\n\nSo, I think 9:30 AM is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9:30\\ \\text{AM}} \\]"
