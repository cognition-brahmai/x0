He's one of the most famous scientists in history, known not only for his theory of relativity but also for his contributions to other areas of physics. The equation E=mc\u00b2 is part of his theory of special relativity, which he published in 1905. This theory fundamentally changed our understanding of space and time. Later, in 1915, he introduced the theory of general relativity, which is our current description of gravity. Einstein's work has had a profound impact on modern physics and technology."
