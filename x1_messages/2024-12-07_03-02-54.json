        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 10 employees, each working 40 hours per week at an hourly wage of $25. The company plans to give each employee a 10% raise, and we need to find out what the new total weekly payroll cost will be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 10% raise means for each employee's hourly wage. If someone is making $25 per hour and gets a 10% raise, how much more will they make per hour?\n\nWell, 10% of $25 is calculated by multiplying 25 by 0.10. So, 25 * 0.10 = $2.50. That means each employee's hourly wage will increase by $2.50.\n\nSo, the new hourly wage for each employee will be their current wage plus the raise amount. That is $25 + $2.50 = $27.50 per hour.\n\nNow, each employee works 40 hours per week. So, to find out how much each employee will earn per week after the raise, I need to multiply their new hourly wage by the number of hours they work weekly. That is $27.50 * 40.\n\nLet me calculate that: 27.50 * 40 = $1,100 per week per employee.\n\nNow, there are 10 employees in total. So, to find the total weekly payroll cost for all employees, I need to multiply the weekly earnings of one employee by the number of employees. That is $1,100 * 10.\n\nCalculating that: 1,100 * 10 = $11,000.\n\nTherefore, the new total weekly payroll cost after giving each employee a 10% raise will be $11,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the hourly wage: $25 per hour.\n\n10% raise: 25 * 0.10 = $2.50.\n\nNew hourly wage: 25 + 2.50 = $27.50.\n\nWeekly hours: 40.\n\nWeekly earnings per employee: 27.50 * 40 = $1,100.\n\nNumber of employees: 10.\n\nTotal weekly payroll: 1,100 * 10 = $11,000.\n\nSeems correct. Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of the total payroll before the raise and then applying the raise.\n\nOriginally, without the raise, each employee earns $25 * 40 = $1,000 per week.\n\nTotal payroll before raise: $1,000 * 10 = $10,000.\n\nA 10% raise on the total payroll would be $10,000 * 0.10 = $1,000.\n\nSo, new total payroll: $10,000 + $1,000 = $11,000.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that $11,000 is the correct new total weekly payroll cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11000} \\]"
