Let me try to provide you with accurate details based on my knowledge.\n\nAmelia Earhart was actually an American aviator, not a British sailor. She made history by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932, not by sailing across the Pacific Ocean in 1942. Her disappearance occurred in 1937, not 1957, during an attempt to fly around the world.\n\nIn 1937, Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, embarked on a challenging flight around the globe, following a route near the equator. During this attempt, their Lockheed Electra aircraft disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean near Howland Island. Despite extensive search efforts, neither Earhart nor Noonan was ever found, and their fate remains one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.\n\nI recommend checking reliable sources like official biographies or history websites to get accurate information about historical figures.\n\nReference:\n\n- Biography.com: Amelia Earhart [https://www.biography.com/explorer/amelia-earhart]"
