        "content": "So the factory currently produces 500 units of product A each day, and each unit sells for $20. If they increase production by 10%, I need to find out how much additional revenue that would generate.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate what 10% of the current production is. So, 10% of 500 units is:\n\n500 units * 0.10 = 50 units\n\nSo, if they increase production by 10%, they would be producing an additional 50 units per day.\n\nNext, since each unit sells for $20, the additional revenue from these 50 units would be:\n\n50 units * $20/unit = $1000\n\nTherefore, the factory would generate an additional $1000 in revenue per day if they increased production by 10%.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? For example, are there any costs associated with increasing production? The question only asks for additional revenue, so maybe I don't need to consider costs.\n\nStill, it's important to note that increasing production might come with additional costs, like more raw materials, higher utility bills, or overtime for workers. But since the question is only about revenue, I shouldn't include those in my calculation.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the factory can sell all the additional units. If there's a chance that they might not be able to sell the extra 50 units, then the additional revenue might not be realized fully. But based on the information provided, it seems that they can sell all the units they produce.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the price per unit remains the same at $20 even with increased production. If producing more leads to economies of scale and they can sell each unit at a higher price or maintain the current price, that's fine. But again, the question states that each unit sells for $20, so I'll assume that remains constant.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory would generate an additional $1000 in revenue per day by increasing production by 10%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
