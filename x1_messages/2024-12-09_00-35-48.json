        "content": "So I've got this triangle with sides of lengths 5, 12, and 13, and I need to find its area. Hmm, I remember that there are different ways to find the area of a triangle, like using the formula with base and height, or maybe Heron's formula. But first, I should check if this is a right-angled triangle because that might make things easier.\n\nLet me see, in a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem holds: the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, the sides are 5, 12, and 13. Let's check if 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 equals 13\u00b2.\n\n5\u00b2 is 25, and 12\u00b2 is 144. Adding those up, 25 + 144 equals 169. And 13\u00b2 is also 169. So yes, it's a right-angled triangle with legs of 5 and 12, and hypotenuse of 13.\n\nSince it's a right-angled triangle, the area can be found using the formula: area = (base \u00d7 height) / 2. Here, the base and height are the two legs, which are 5 and 12.\n\nSo, area = (5 \u00d7 12) / 2 = 60 / 2 = 30.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to confirm this? Maybe using Heron's formula. Heron's formula says that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c is square root of [s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFirst, find the semi-perimeter s: s = (5 + 12 + 13) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nThen, area = sqrt[15(15 - 5)(15 - 12)(15 - 13)] = sqrt[15 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2] = sqrt[900] = 30.\n\nOkay, so both methods give the same answer, which is 30. Maybe I can also double-check this using coordinates. Suppose I place the triangle on a coordinate plane with the right angle at the origin.\n\nLet\u2019s say point A is at (0,0), point B is at (12,0), and point C is at (0,5). Then, the area can be calculated using the shoelace formula:\n\nArea = |(x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y1 - x1y3 - x2y1 - x3y2)/2|\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\nArea = |(0\u00d70 + 12\u00d75 + 0\u00d70 - 0\u00d75 - 12\u00d70 - 0\u00d70)/2| = |(0 + 60 + 0 - 0 - 0 - 0)/2| = |60/2| = 30.\n\nAgain, the area is 30. Or maybe I can think about it in terms of vectors. If I have vectors AB and AC, the area is half the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nVector AB is (12,0), vector AC is (0,5). The cross product in 2D is AB_x \u00d7 AC_y - AB_y \u00d7 AC_x = 12\u00d75 - 0\u00d70 = 60 - 0 = 60. So, area = |60| / 2 = 30.\n\nAlright, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 30 as the area. I think it's safe to conclude that the area of the triangle is 30.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other type of triangle with sides 5, 12, 13 that isn't right-angled. Wait, no, in this case, since 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 13\u00b2, it must be a right-angled triangle. So, there's no need to worry about other possibilities.\n\nI should also remember that in a right-angled triangle, the area is simply half the product of the legs, which are the two shorter sides. So, again, (5 \u00d7 12) / 2 = 30.\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of trigonometry. The area of a triangle is (1/2)ab sin C, where a and b are two sides and C is the included angle. In this case, since it's a right-angled triangle, sin 90\u00b0 = 1, so area = (1/2) \u00d7 5 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 1 = 30.\n\nOkay, I've confirmed it every which way. The area is definitely 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
