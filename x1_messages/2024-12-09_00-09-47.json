        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains heading towards each other from Station A and Station B, which are 300 miles apart. The first train leaves Station A at 8:00 AM going 60 mph, and the second train leaves Station B at 9:00 AM going 80 mph. I need to figure out when they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I should note down the key points:\n\n- Train A: leaves Station A at 8:00 AM at 60 mph\n\n- Train B: leaves Station B at 9:00 AM at 80 mph\n\n- Distance between stations: 300 miles\n\nSince they're heading towards each other, their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they approach each other. So, the combined speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nBut wait, Train B leaves an hour later. So, in that one hour, Train A has already been covering some distance.\n\nLet me calculate how far Train A has traveled by the time Train B starts at 9:00 AM.\n\nTrain A's speed: 60 mph\n\nTime traveled before Train B starts: 1 hour\n\nDistance covered by Train A in that hour: 60 miles\n\nSo, at 9:00 AM, the remaining distance between the two trains is 300 - 60 = 240 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to cover the remaining 240 miles at 140 mph, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nTime = 240 miles / 140 mph = 1.714 hours\n\nWhat's 1.714 hours in minutes? Let's see:\n\n0.714 hours * 60 minutes/hour \u2248 42.86 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 1 hour and 43 minutes after 9:00 AM, they will meet.\n\nTherefore, the meeting time is around 10:43 AM.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure.\n\nFirst, Train A travels for 1 hour before Train B starts, covering 60 miles. So, the remaining distance is 240 miles.\n\nThen, both trains travel towards each other at a combined speed of 140 mph.\n\nTime to cover 240 miles at 140 mph is indeed 240/140 = 1.714 hours, which is about 1 hour and 43 minutes.\n\nSo, adding that to Train B's start time of 9:00 AM, they should meet around 10:43 AM.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10:43 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
