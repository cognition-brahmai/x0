        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 red balls and 3 blue balls, and I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random, both of them are red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of balls in the box. There are 5 red and 3 blue, so total balls are 5 + 3 = 8 balls.\n\nNow, I'm picking two balls randomly. I need to find the probability that both are red.\n\nI remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to pick any two balls out of 8.\n\nAnd the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick two red balls out of the 5 red balls.\n\nSounds straightforward.\n\nLet me recall how to calculate the number of ways to choose k items from n items. It's the combination formula, right? Which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 8 is C(8, 2).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5, 2).\n\nTherefore, the probability should be C(5, 2) / C(8, 2).\n\nLet me calculate C(5, 2).\n\n5! is 120, 2! is 2, and (5-2)! is 6. So, C(5, 2) = 120 / (2 * 6) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, C(8, 2).\n\n8! is 40320, 2! is 2, and (8-2)! is 720. So, C(8, 2) = 40320 / (2 * 720) = 40320 / 1440 = 28.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check those calculations.\n\nActually, I think I messed up the factorials.\n\nLet me recall that n! means factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nBut for combinations, we use C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nBut calculating factorials for large n can be time-consuming, so there's a simpler way to compute combinations.\n\nI think there's a simplified formula for C(n, k).\n\nYes, C(n, k) can also be calculated as [n * (n - 1) * ... * (n - k + 1)] / [k!].\n\nSo, for C(5, 2), it's (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nSimilarly, C(8, 2) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 56 / 2 = 28.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the probability is 10 / 28, which can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2, giving 5 / 14.\n\nWait, 10 divided by 2 is 5, and 28 divided by 2 is 14. So, 5/14.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/14.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the probability of picking a red ball first and then another red ball second, considering that the picks are without replacement.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball first is 5/8, since there are 5 red balls out of 8 total balls.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 7 balls left in the box.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is 4/7.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening is (5/8) * (4/7) = 20/56, which simplifies to 5/14.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this problem.\n\nSuppose I think about the total number of possible pairs of balls.\n\nThere are 8 balls, and I'm choosing 2, so 28 possible pairs, as calculated earlier.\n\nNow, out of these 28 pairs, how many consist of two red balls?\n\nWell, there are 5 red balls, and I can choose 2 out of them in C(5, 2) = 10 ways.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 10/28 = 5/14.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the blue balls.\n\nBut since the question is about both balls being red, I don't need to consider the blue balls directly.\n\nHowever, for completeness, I could calculate the probability of getting two red balls by subtracting the probabilities of the other possible outcomes from 1.\n\nThe possible outcomes are:\n\nBoth red: which is what we're finding.\n\nOne red and one blue.\n\nBoth blue.\n\nBut calculating it that way might be more complicated, especially since we already have a straightforward answer.\n\nGiven that, I think sticking with the initial approach is best.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5/14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{14}} \\]"
