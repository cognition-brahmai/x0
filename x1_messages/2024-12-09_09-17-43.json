        "content": "So I have this problem here. There's a man with 53 socks in his drawer. Out of these, 30 are white, and the remaining are black. Now, the room is completely dark, so he can't see anything. The question is, what's the minimum number of socks he needs to take out to ensure that he gets a pair of the same color?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what a pair means. A pair of socks would mean two socks of the same color. So, either two white socks or two black socks.\n\nNow, the drawer has 30 white socks and, since there are 53 socks in total, the number of black socks would be 53 minus 30, which is 23 black socks.\n\nThe room is dark, so he can't see the colors. He needs to pick socks randomly. The question is asking for the minimum number of socks he needs to take out to ensure that he has at least one pair of the same color.\n\nI think the key here is to consider the worst-case scenario. What's the worst that could happen?\n\nWell, the worst case would be that he picks one white sock and one black sock in his first two picks. That way, he has two socks, but they are of different colors, so he doesn't have a pair yet.\n\nNow, for him to guarantee having a pair of the same color, he needs to pick one more sock. That third sock will definitely make a pair with one of the first two.\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\n1. First sock: It could be either white or black. Let's say it's white.\n\n2. Second sock: It could again be white or black. To avoid having a pair, it should be the other color. So, let's say it's black.\n\nNow, he has one white and one black sock. Still no pair.\n\n3. Third sock: Now, regardless of whether it's white or black, it will make a pair with one of the first two.\n\n- If it's white, it pairs with the first white sock.\n\n- If it's black, it pairs with the second black sock.\n\nSo, in this scenario, picking three socks guarantees that he has at least one pair of the same color.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that he could pick more than two socks without getting a pair?\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf he picks three socks, as in the above scenario, he's guaranteed a pair.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to pick more than two socks without getting a pair. But no, because once you pick the third sock, it has to match one of the first two.\n\nWait, but what if there are more than two colors? Oh, but in this problem, there are only two colors: white and black.\n\nSo, the maximum number of socks he can pick without getting a pair is two (one white and one black).\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks he needs to pick to guarantee a pair is three.\n\nBut let me double-check this logic.\n\nSuppose he picks two socks: one white and one black. No pair yet.\n\nPick a third sock: it must be either white or black, which will pair with one of the first two.\n\nSo, yes, three socks guarantee at least one pair.\n\nBut the problem mentions that there are 30 white socks and 23 black socks. Does the exact number matter here?\n\nWell, in this case, it doesn't, because we're dealing with the worst-case scenario.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where picking three socks doesn't guarantee a pair.\n\nSuppose he picks two socks of different colors and a third sock. The third sock has to be one of the two colors, so it will pair with one of the first two.\n\nThere's no way to pick three socks without getting at least one pair of the same color.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is three.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the total number of socks.\n\nHe has 53 socks: 30 white and 23 black.\n\nIf he picks two socks, he could have one white and one black.\n\nPick a third sock: it has to be either white or black, making a pair with one of the first two.\n\nSo, yes, three socks guarantee a pair.\n\nBut is there a general formula for this?\n\nI think this is related to the pigeonhole principle.\n\nThe pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole has more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this context, the \"pigeonholes\" are the colors, and the \"pigeons\" are the socks being picked.\n\nThere are two colors (pigeonholes). To ensure that at least one pigeonhole has two pigeons, you need to pick three socks.\n\nBecause if you pick two socks, they could be different colors, but the third sock will have to match one of them.\n\nSo, in general, for two colors, you need to pick three socks to guarantee a pair.\n\nBut let's consider if there were more colors. Say, three colors.\n\nThen, to guarantee a pair, you would need to pick four socks, because you could pick three socks, each of a different color, and the fourth sock would have to match one of them.\n\nBut in this problem, there are only two colors, so the minimum number is three.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies that there are only two colors: white and black.\n\nSo, yes, three socks guarantee a pair.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the extreme case.\n\nSuppose he picks one white sock and one black sock. No pair yet.\n\nThen he picks a third sock. It has to be either white or black, making a pair with one of the first two.\n\nThere's no other possibility.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is three.\n\nBut the problem might be trying to test something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of each color.\n\nBut no, because the colors are only two, and we've established that three socks guarantee a pair.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nMaybe the question is about getting a specific color pair, like two white socks or two black socks.\n\nBut no, the question says \"a pair of the same color,\" which includes either two white or two black.\n\nSo, the answer remains three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the distribution of the socks.\n\nBut again, with 30 white and 23 black, the total is 53, which doesn't change the logic.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a trick involving the majority color.\n\nSince there are more white socks than black, maybe there's a different way to approach it.\n\nBut no, because the worst-case scenario still applies: picking one of each color first, and then the third sock guarantees a pair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the probability of picking socks of the same color.\n\nBut the question is about guaranteeing a pair, not about probability.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the minimum number of socks he needs to take out to ensure he gets a pair of the same color is three.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
