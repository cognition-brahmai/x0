        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to find out the total distance it covers. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the train travels at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour for 3 hours. Then, it travels at another average speed of 60 kilometers per hour for 4 hours. I need to find the total distance traveled.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, maybe I can calculate the distance for each part of the trip separately and then add them together to get the total distance.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor the first part of the trip:\n\nSpeed = 80 kilometers per hour\n\nTime = 3 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 80 km/h \u00d7 3 h = 240 kilometers\n\nOkay, so the train travels 240 kilometers in the first part.\n\nNow, for the second part:\n\nSpeed = 60 kilometers per hour\n\nTime = 4 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 km/h \u00d7 4 h = 240 kilometers\n\nSo, in the second part, the train also travels 240 kilometers.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together:\n\nTotal distance = 240 km + 240 km = 480 kilometers\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe I can consider the average speed for the entire trip and then multiply by the total time.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, total time traveled is 3 hours + 4 hours = 7 hours.\n\nNow, if I try to find the average speed for the entire trip, it would be the total distance divided by the total time. But I don't know the total distance yet, which is what I'm trying to find.\n\nHmm, so maybe that's not the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of weighted average speed, taking into account the time spent at each speed.\n\nAverage speed = (total distance) / (total time)\n\nBut again, that seems circular because I don't know the total distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the distance separately for each segment, as I did before, and then sum them up.\n\nThat seems to make sense and is straightforward.\n\nSo, first segment: 80 km/h \u00d7 3 h = 240 km\n\nSecond segment: 60 km/h \u00d7 4 h = 240 km\n\nTotal distance: 240 km + 240 km = 480 km\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can plot a speed-time graph and find the area under the curve, which would give me the distance.\n\nBut that might be more complicated for this straightforward problem.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like acceleration or stops, but the problem doesn't mention any of that. It just gives average speeds for each segment of the trip.\n\nSo, assuming the train travels at a constant speed during each segment, my calculation should be accurate.\n\nWait, another thought: average speed is not just the arithmetic mean of the two speeds, because the time spent at each speed is different.\n\nIf I were to take the arithmetic mean of 80 km/h and 60 km/h, that would be (80 + 60)/2 = 70 km/h, but that's not correct in this context because the train spends more time at 60 km/h than at 80 km/h.\n\nTo find the average speed for the entire trip, I should weigh the speeds by the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, average speed = (distance1 + distance2) / (time1 + time2) = (240 km + 240 km) / (3 h + 4 h) = 480 km / 7 h \u2248 68.57 km/h\n\nInteresting, so the average speed for the entire trip is approximately 68.57 km/h, not the arithmetic mean of 70 km/h.\n\nBut actually, the problem doesn't ask for the average speed; it asks for the total distance traveled.\n\nSo, I've already calculated that as 480 kilometers.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can use the average speed I just calculated and multiply it by the total time to see if I get the same distance.\n\nAverage speed \u2248 68.57 km/h\n\nTotal time = 7 hours\n\nTotal distance = average speed \u00d7 total time \u2248 68.57 km/h \u00d7 7 h = 480 kilometers\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total distance traveled by the train is 480 kilometers.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the formula:\n\nTotal distance = (speed1 \u00d7 time1) + (speed2 \u00d7 time2) = (80 km/h \u00d7 3 h) + (60 km/h \u00d7 4 h) = 240 km + 240 km = 480 km\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using ratios or something, but that seems unnecessary for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the train's speed changing, but again, the problem provides average speeds for each segment, so my initial approach is adequate.\n\nTherefore, the total distance traveled by the train is 480 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480} \\]"
