        "content": "So I have this problem here: There are 120 students in a school, and each student knows exactly 3 languages. We need to find out how many languages are known in total, given that every pair of languages is known by at least one student.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem that involves combinatorics, maybe some graph theory. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's think about what's being asked. We need to find the total number of languages, given some constraints about how they're distributed among the students.\n\nLet's denote the total number of languages by n. Each student knows exactly 3 languages, so for each student, there are 3 languages that they know.\n\nThe condition is that every pair of languages is known by at least one student. That means for any two languages, there is at least one student who knows both of them.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest n such that each student knows exactly 3 languages, and every pair of languages is known by at least one student.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is to find the number of languages given these conditions, assuming that 120 students each know exactly 3 languages, and every pair is known by at least one student.\n\nThis sounds a bit like a covering problem, where we need to cover all possible pairs of languages with the students' sets of three languages.\n\nLet me try to think about it in terms of combinations.\n\nIf there are n languages, the number of possible pairs of languages is C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nEach student knows 3 languages, so the number of pairs that each student covers is C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nSince there are 120 students, the total number of pairs covered is 120 * 3 = 360.\n\nBut, since each pair is covered at least once, we have that 360 is at least the number of unique pairs, which is C(n, 2).\n\nSo, C(n, 2) \u2264 360.\n\nThat gives us n(n-1)/2 \u2264 360.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2: n(n-1) \u2264 720.\n\nNow, I need to find the largest integer n such that n(n-1) \u2264 720.\n\nLet's try n=27: 27*26=702, which is less than 720.\n\nn=28: 28*27=756, which is greater than 720.\n\nSo, n \u2264 27.\n\nBut wait, this is just an upper bound. We need to check if n=27 is achievable with the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=27 is the exact number.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nWe have C(27, 2) = 27*26/2 = 351 pairs.\n\nAnd 120 students, each covering 3 pairs, total coverage is 360.\n\nSince 360 > 351, it's possible to cover all 351 pairs with 120 students, each covering 3 pairs.\n\nBut I need to ensure that every pair is covered at least once.\n\nWait, but actually, 360 is greater than 351, so it's possible.\n\nBut maybe n can be larger than 27.\n\nWait, earlier I saw that n=27 gives C(27,2)=351, and 120*3=360, which covers it.\n\nn=28 gives C(28,2)=378, which is more than 360, so it might not be possible to cover all pairs with only 360 coverings.\n\nWait, but maybe some pairs are covered multiple times.\n\nBut the condition is just that every pair is known by at least one student, so maybe it's okay if some pairs are covered multiple times.\n\nSo, with n=27, C(27,2)=351 < 360, so it's possible.\n\nWith n=28, C(28,2)=378, which is greater than 360, so it might not be possible to cover all pairs with only 120 students each covering 3 pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps with n=28, it's still possible if some pairs are covered multiple times, but the total coverage is 360, which is less than 378.\n\nWait, no. If there are 378 pairs and only 360 coverings, even if some coverings cover multiple pairs, it's not possible to cover all 378 pairs with only 360 coverings, because each covering can cover up to 3 pairs, but we have more pairs than coverings.\n\nWait, but actually, since each covering covers 3 pairs, and we have 360 coverings, the total number of pair coverings is 360*3=1080.\n\nBut if there are 378 pairs, and each pair needs at least one covering, then 1080 is more than enough to cover 378 pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps n=28 is possible.\n\nWait, but with n=28, C(28,2)=378.\n\nAnd 120 students, each covering 3 pairs, total coverage is 360.\n\nWait, but 360 < 378, so it's impossible to cover all 378 pairs with only 360 coverings if each covering can cover up to 3 pairs.\n\nWait, no. Each student covers 3 pairs, but the total number of coverings is 360, which is less than 378.\n\nBut perhaps some pairs are covered multiple times, but still, all pairs are covered at least once.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I can model this as a graph.\n\nLet's consider languages as vertices of a graph, and students as edges that connect triples of vertices.\n\nWait, that might not be the best way.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a block design problem.\n\nIn design theory, a Steiner triple system is a collection of triples such that every pair appears in exactly one triple.\n\nBut in this problem, every pair appears in at least one triple, and we might have multiple triples containing the same pair.\n\nSo, it's similar to a Steiner triple system, but here, we might have some pairs covered multiple times.\n\nIn a Steiner triple system, the number of triples is n(n-1)/6, where n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn our case, each student corresponds to a triple, and we have 120 students.\n\nSo, if n is the number of languages, then the number of triples is 120.\n\nIn a Steiner triple system, the number of triples is n(n-1)/6.\n\nSo, if n(n-1)/6 = 120, then n(n-1) = 720.\n\nSolving n(n-1)=720.\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation: n^2 - n - 720 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: n = [1 + sqrt(1 + 2880)] / 2 = [1 + sqrt(2881)] / 2.\n\nsqrt(2881) is approximately 53.66, so n \u2248 [1 + 53.66]/2 \u2248 27.33.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n=27 or n=28.\n\nBut n=27 gives n(n-1)=27*26=702, which is less than 720.\n\nn=28 gives n(n-1)=28*27=756, which is greater than 720.\n\nSo, n=27 is too small for a Steiner triple system with 120 triples, and n=28 is too big.\n\nWait, but perhaps there isn't a Steiner triple system with exactly 120 triples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can have a system where some pairs are covered multiple times.\n\nIn that case, with n=27, C(27,2)=351 pairs, and 120 students each covering 3 pairs, total coverage is 360.\n\nSince 360 > 351, it's possible to cover all pairs at least once.\n\nWith n=28, C(28,2)=378 pairs, and 360 coverings, it's still possible, since 360 < 378, but perhaps some pairs are covered multiple times to make up for the deficit.\n\nWait, but 360 coverings, each covering 3 pairs, give a total of 1080 pair coverings.\n\nIf there are 378 pairs, and each needs at least one covering, then it's possible, since 1080 >> 378.\n\nBut I need to ensure that with 120 triples, I can cover all 378 pairs.\n\nWait, but with n=28, and 120 triples, it's possible that some pairs are covered multiple times, but all pairs are covered at least once.\n\nSo, perhaps n=28 is possible.\n\nBut maybe n=27 is also possible, and n=28 is also possible.\n\nWait, but I need to find the number of languages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula to relate the number of students, the number of languages, and the number of languages each student knows.\n\nLet me think in terms of double counting.\n\nLet me consider the total number of (student, language) pairs where a student knows a language.\n\nEach student knows 3 languages, so there are 120*3=360 such pairs.\n\nOn the other hand, if there are n languages, and each language is known by some number of students, then the total number of (student, language) pairs is also equal to the sum over all languages of the number of students who know that language.\n\nAlternatively, if I let d_i be the number of students who know language L_i, then the total number of (student, language) pairs is sum d_i over all languages.\n\nBut I don't know the d_i's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each pair is covered.\n\nWait, maybe inclusion-exclusion is too complicated here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each pair of languages is known by at least one student.\n\nSo, for any two languages, there is at least one student who knows both.\n\nIn terms of graph theory, if I consider languages as vertices and students as hyperedges of size 3, then the hypergraph needs to be such that every pair of vertices is contained in at least one hyperedge.\n\nThis is similar to a covering design in combinatorics.\n\nIn covering design, we have a set of elements, and we want to cover all k-subsets with r-subsets.\n\nIn this case, we have elements as languages, and we want to cover all 2-subsets (pairs) with 3-subsets (triples), using 120 hyperedges (students).\n\nThe goal is to find the smallest n such that there exists a covering design with these parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a way to calculate n directly.\n\nLet me try to set up an equation.\n\nLet n be the number of languages.\n\nEach student knows 3 languages, so the number of pairs each student covers is C(3,2)=3.\n\nTotal number of pairs covered is 120*3=360.\n\nThe total number of unique pairs is C(n,2)=n(n-1)/2.\n\nSince every pair is covered at least once, we have that C(n,2) \u2264 360.\n\nSo, n(n-1)/2 \u2264 360.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2: n(n-1) \u2264 720.\n\nNow, solve for n: n^2 - n - 720 \u2264 0.\n\nSolve n^2 - n - 720 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: n = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 2880)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(2881)] / 2.\n\nsqrt(2881) is approximately 53.67.\n\nSo, n = [1 + 53.67]/2 \u2248 27.335 and n = [1 - 53.67]/2 \u2248 -26.335.\n\nSince n must be positive, n \u2264 [1 + sqrt(1 + 2880)] / 2 \u2248 27.335.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n \u2264 27.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought n=28 might be possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if n=28 is possible.\n\nIf n=28, then C(28,2)=378, and 120 students each covering 3 pairs give a total coverage of 360, which is less than 378.\n\nBut in covering designs, it's possible to have some pairs covered multiple times, as long as all pairs are covered at least once.\n\nSo, perhaps n=28 is still possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=27 is the answer.\n\nLet me check for n=27.\n\nC(27,2)=351, and 120*3=360, which is greater than 351.\n\nSo, it's possible to cover all 351 pairs with 120 students, each covering 3 pairs.\n\nSimilarly, for n=28, C(28,2)=378, which is greater than 360, but perhaps some pairs are covered multiple times to make up for the extra pairs needed.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that all 378 pairs are covered with only 360 coverings, each covering 3 pairs.\n\nIt seems tight, but maybe it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n=27 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the minimal number of students needed to cover all pairs for a given n.\n\nIn a Steiner triple system, the number of triples is exactly C(n,2)/3.\n\nBut in this problem, we have that each pair is covered at least once, but not necessarily exactly once.\n\nSo, the number of triples (students) needed is at least C(n,2)/3.\n\nIn our case, C(n,2)/3 \u2264 120, since we have 120 students.\n\nSo, n(n-1)/6 \u2264 120.\n\nThus, n(n-1) \u2264 720.\n\nAgain, n \u2264 approximately 27.335.\n\nSo, n \u2264 27.\n\nBut perhaps n can be larger if some pairs are covered multiple times.\n\nHowever, the minimal number of triples needed to cover all pairs is C(n,2)/3, rounded up.\n\nIf C(n,2)/3 > 120, then n is too large.\n\nWait, but in this problem, we have exactly 120 students, each covering 3 pairs, total coverage 360.\n\nWe need to cover C(n,2) pairs, each at least once.\n\nSo, C(n,2) \u2264 360.\n\nThus, n(n-1)/2 \u2264 360.\n\nThus, n(n-1) \u2264 720.\n\nSo, n \u2264 27.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible n is 27.\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to have n=28 with some pairs covered multiple times.\n\nWait, but with n=28, C(28,2)=378, and 120*3=360 coverings.\n\nSince 360 < 378, it's impossible to cover all 378 pairs with only 360 coverings, even if some coverings cover multiple pairs.\n\nWait, but each student covers 3 pairs, so it's possible that some pairs are covered multiple times.\n\nHowever, the total number of pair coverings is 360*3=1080, which is more than enough to cover 378 pairs, even if some pairs are covered multiple times.\n\nSo, perhaps n=28 is still possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=27 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the exact coverage.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose there are n languages.\n\nEach student knows exactly 3 languages, so each student corresponds to a triple of languages.\n\nThe condition is that every pair of languages is covered by at least one student.\n\nThis is similar to a covering design, where we want to cover all pairs with triples.\n\nThe La Jolla Covering Repository gives tables for covering designs.\n\nFor covering design C(v, k, t), it's the smallest number of k-subsets (blocks) needed to cover all t-subsets.\n\nIn our case, v = n (languages), k = 3 (languages per student), t = 2 (pairs of languages).\n\nWe need C(n, 3, 2) \u2264 120.\n\nFrom covering design theory, C(v,3,2) = ceil(v(v-1)/6).\n\nWe have C(n,3,2) \u2264 120.\n\nSo, ceil(n(n-1)/6) \u2264 120.\n\nThus, n(n-1)/6 \u2264 120.\n\nTherefore, n(n-1) \u2264 720.\n\nAgain, n \u2264 approximately 27.335.\n\nSo, n \u2264 27.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible n is 27.\n\nBut perhaps there is a better bound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n can be 28 if some pairs are covered multiple times.\n\nBut according to the covering design theory, C(28,3,2) = 120.\n\nWait, according to some sources, C(28,3,2) = 120.\n\nSo, with n=28, it's possible to cover all C(28,2)=378 pairs with 120 triples, where each pair is covered at least once.\n\nSo, n=28 is possible.\n\nThen, perhaps n=28 is the answer.\n\nBut earlier, with n=27, C(27,2)=351, and 120*3=360, which is sufficient.\n\nSo, n=28 is possible, and n=27 is also possible.\n\nBut perhaps n=28 is the minimal number that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, no, n=27 is smaller than n=28, and both seem to satisfy the condition.\n\nBut according to covering design theory, C(28,3,2)=120, meaning that 120 triples are sufficient to cover all pairs for n=28.\n\nSimilarly, for n=27, C(27,3,2)=117.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 120 students, which is more than 117, so it's definitely possible for n=27.\n\nBut the problem is to find out how many languages are known, given that every pair is known by at least one student.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of languages is 28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number is 27.\n\nBut according to covering design tables, C(28,3,2)=120, meaning that with 28 languages and 120 students each knowing 3 languages, all pairs are covered.\n\nSimilarly, for n=27, C(27,3,2)=117, which is less than 120, meaning that 117 students are sufficient to cover all pairs for n=27.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 120 students.\n\nSo, perhaps n=28 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n can be larger than 28.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier inequality, n(n-1) \u2264 720, which gives n \u2264 27.\n\nBut covering design theory says that C(28,3,2)=120, meaning that with n=28, 120 students are sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the inequality is not tight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=28 is the exact number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 27.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that with n=28, C(28,2)=378 pairs, and 120 students each covering 3 pairs, total coverage is 360, which is less than 378.\n\nBut covering designs allow for some pairs to be covered multiple times, as long as all pairs are covered at least once.\n\nSo, with 120 students each covering 3 pairs, total coverage is 360, which is more than 378, but actually, each student covers 3 pairs, so total pair coverings are 120*3=360, which is less than 378.\n\nWait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, if each student covers 3 pairs, and there are 120 students, then the total number of pair coverings is 120*3=360.\n\nBut there are 378 pairs to cover.\n\nSo, with only 360 coverings, it's impossible to cover all 378 pairs, even if some pairs are covered multiple times.\n\nWait, but perhaps some pairs are covered multiple times to make up for the deficit.\n\nBut mathematically, if there are 378 pairs and only 360 coverings, it's impossible for all pairs to be covered at least once.\n\nWait, no, actually, it is possible if some coverings cover multiple pairs.\n\nBut in this case, each covering covers exactly 3 pairs.\n\nSo, total pair coverings are 360, each covering 3 pairs.\n\nWait, no, wait: each student covers 3 languages, which means they cover C(3,2)=3 pairs.\n\nSo, total pair coverings are 120 students * 3 pairs/student = 360 pair coverings.\n\nBut there are 378 pairs to cover.\n\nSo, with only 360 pair coverings, it's impossible to cover all 378 pairs at least once.\n\nTherefore, n cannot be 28.\n\nTherefore, n must be less than or equal to 27.\n\nSimilarly, for n=27, C(27,2)=351 pairs, and 360 pair coverings are sufficient to cover all pairs.\n\nTherefore, n=27 is possible.\n\nIs n=27 the minimal possible?\n\nWait, perhaps n can be larger than 27, but as per the earlier argument, n cannot be 28.\n\nWait, but according to covering design theory, C(28,3,2)=120, meaning that with n=28, it's possible to cover all pairs with 120 triples.\n\nBut according to the pair coverings calculation, it's impossible because 120*3=360 < 378.\n\nSo, there's a contradiction here.\n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me look up covering design C(v,k,t).\n\nC(v,k,t) is the minimal number of k-subsets needed to cover all t-subsets.\n\nIn our case, v=n, k=3, t=2.\n\nSo, C(n,3,2)= minimal number of triples needed to cover all pairs.\n\nAccording to covering design theory, C(28,3,2)=120.\n\nSimilarly, C(27,3,2)=117.\n\nSo, with n=27, only 117 triples are needed to cover all pairs.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 120 students, which is more than enough for n=27.\n\nSimilarly, for n=28, C(28,3,2)=120, meaning that 120 triples are sufficient to cover all pairs.\n\nBut according to the pair coverings calculation, with n=28, C(28,2)=378 pairs, and 120 students each covering 3 pairs give a total of 360 pair coverings, which is less than 378.\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nPerhaps the covering design C(v,k,t) allows for some pairs to be covered multiple times, but ensures that all pairs are covered at least once.\n\nSo, even if the total number of pair coverings is less than the number of pairs, it might still be possible to cover all pairs at least once.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nIf there are 378 pairs and only 360 pair coverings, it's impossible to cover all pairs at least once.\n\nUnless some pair coverings cover the same pair multiple times.\n\nBut in this setup, each triple covers 3 distinct pairs.\n\nSo, no two triples can cover the same pair.\n\nWait, no, actually, two different triples can both cover the same pair.\n\nFor example, triples {a,b,c} and {a,b,d} both cover the pair {a,b}.\n\nSo, it's possible for multiple triples to cover the same pair.\n\nTherefore, with 120 triples, each covering 3 pairs, total pair coverings are 360.\n\nIf there are 378 pairs, and some pairs are covered multiple times, but only 360 pair coverings, it's still impossible to cover all 378 pairs at least once.\n\nBecause even if some pairs are covered multiple times, the total number of unique pairs covered cannot exceed 360, which is less than 378.\n\nTherefore, n cannot be 28.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible n is 27.\n\nSimilarly, for n=27, C(27,2)=351 pairs, and 120 students covering 360 pairs, which is sufficient to cover all pairs at least once.\n\nTherefore, the number of languages is 27.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{27}\n"
