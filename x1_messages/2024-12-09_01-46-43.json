        "content": "So, the question is about calculating the amount of CO2 produced by a car after burning a certain amount of gasoline. The given data is that the car produces 2.3 kilograms of CO2 per liter of gasoline burned. We need to find out how much CO2 is produced after burning 50 liters of gasoline.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the amount of gasoline burned and the CO2 produced. The problem states that for every liter of gasoline burned, 2.3 kg of CO2 is produced. So, it's a direct proportion: more gasoline burned means more CO2 produced.\n\nTo find the total CO2 produced for 50 liters, I can multiply the CO2 produced per liter by the number of liters burned. So, the formula would be:\n\nTotal CO2 = CO2 per liter \u00d7 number of liters\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal CO2 = 2.3 kg/liter \u00d7 50 liters\n\nNow, performing the multiplication:\n\n2.3 kg/liter \u00d7 50 liters = 115 kg\n\nSo, the car produces 115 kilograms of CO2 after burning 50 liters of gasoline.\n\nTo make sure this makes sense, let's think about it differently. If 1 liter produces 2.3 kg of CO2, then 50 liters should produce 50 times that amount. 50 times 2.3 is indeed 115 kg. So, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the units. Kilograms per liter multiplied by liters gives kilograms, which is the unit for the amount of CO2. So, the units also make sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 115 kilograms of CO2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{115 \\text{ kg}} \\]"
