        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B every day. Now, product A needs 4 hours of labor for each unit, and product B needs 5 hours per unit. I need to find out the total hours of labor required each day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the labor hours for product A. Since each unit of A takes 4 hours, and they make 500 units, I can multiply 500 by 4. That should give me the total hours for A.\n\n500 units * 4 hours/unit = 2000 hours.\n\nOkay, that's for product A.\n\nNext, for product B, they produce 300 units, and each unit requires 5 hours of labor. So, I'll multiply 300 by 5.\n\n300 units * 5 hours/unit = 1500 hours.\n\nNow, to get the total labor hours per day, I need to add the hours for A and B together.\n\n2000 hours (A) + 1500 hours (B) = 3500 hours.\n\nSo, the factory requires 3500 hours of labor each day for production.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, are there any overhead labor hours or breaks? But according to the question, it's just about the production labor for these products. So, I think 3500 hours is the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations.\n\n500 units of A * 4 hours = 2000 hours.\n\n300 units of B * 5 hours = 1500 hours.\n\nTotal: 2000 + 1500 = 3500 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3500} \\]"
