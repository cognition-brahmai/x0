        "content": "Let's tackle this population problem step by step. We've got a town with an initial population of 10,000 people. In the first year, the population increases by 10%, and then in the second year, it decreases by 5%. We need to find out what the population is at the end of the second year.\n\nOkay, first things first. An increase of 10% in the first year means that the population goes up by 10% of the initial population. So, let's calculate 10% of 10,000.\n\n10% of 10,000 is calculated as:\n(10/100) * 10,000 = 0.1 * 10,000 = 1,000\n\nSo, the population increases by 1,000 people in the first year. Therefore, the population at the end of the first year is:\n\n10,000 (initial population) + 1,000 (increase) = 11,000\n\nNow, in the second year, the population decreases by 5%. But here's the important part: it's decreasing by 5% of the population at the end of the first year, which is 11,000, not the initial 10,000.\n\nSo, let's calculate 5% of 11,000.\n\n5% of 11,000 is:\n(5/100) * 11,000 = 0.05 * 11,000 = 550\n\nTherefore, the population decreases by 550 people in the second year. So, the population at the end of the second year is:\n\n11,000 (population at the end of the first year) - 550 (decrease) = 10,450\n\nSo, the population at the end of the second year is 10,450 people.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes these percentage changes can be a bit tricky. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm our answer?\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the population changes in terms of multiplication factors.\n\nFirst year increase of 10% can be represented as multiplying by 1 + 0.10 = 1.10\n\nSecond year decrease of 5% can be represented as multiplying by 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\n\nSo, starting with the initial population of 10,000, we can calculate the population at the end of the second year by multiplying:\n\n10,000 * 1.10 * 0.95\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nFirst, 10,000 * 1.10 = 11,000\n\nThen, 11,000 * 0.95 = 10,450\n\nSame answer as before, 10,450 people.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to think about the overall percentage change over the two years, we can calculate the total growth factor.\n\nOverall growth factor = 1.10 * 0.95 = 1.045\n\nThis means the population is multiplied by 1.045 over the two years, which is a 4.5% increase from the initial population.\n\nSo, 4.5% of 10,000 is:\n\n(4.5/100) * 10,000 = 0.045 * 10,000 = 450\n\nAdding that to the initial population: 10,000 + 450 = 10,450\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Suppose we calculate the net change over the two years.\n\nFirst year increase: +10% of 10,000 = +1,000\n\nSecond year decrease: -5% of 11,000 = -550\n\nNet change: +1,000 - 550 = +450\n\nAdding this net change to the initial population: 10,000 + 450 = 10,450\n\nOnce more, we arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the population at the end of the second year is 10,450 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10450} \\]"
