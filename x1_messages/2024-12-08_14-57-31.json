        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! So, you need a JavaScript function that takes two arrays of integers and returns both their intersection and union, and these resulting arrays should be sorted in ascending order. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand what intersection and union mean in this context:\n\n- **Intersection**: These are the elements that are common to both arrays. So, if array A has [1, 2, 3] and array B has [2, 3, 4], the intersection would be [2, 3].\n\n- **Union**: This includes all unique elements from both arrays. So, for the same arrays A and B, the union would be [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nAnd you want both of these results to be sorted in ascending order.\n\nAlright, so the plan is:\n\n1. Find the intersection of the two arrays.\n\n2. Find the union of the two arrays.\n\n3. Sort both resulting arrays in ascending order.\n\n4. Return both sorted arrays, perhaps as properties of an object or inside another array.\n\nLet's think about how to implement each of these steps.\n\n**Step 1: Find the intersection**\n\nTo find the common elements between two arrays, we can use a combination of `filter` and `includes` methods. However, for better performance, especially with larger arrays, it's better to use a Set.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n- Convert both arrays to Sets.\n\n- Use the `has` method of Sets to check for common elements.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `filter` method on one array to include only elements that are present in the other array.\n\n**Step 2: Find the union**\n\nFor the union, we need all unique elements from both arrays. Again, Sets are very useful here because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n- Convert both arrays to Sets.\n\n- Use the `new Set([...setA, ...setB])` approach to combine them into a single Set.\n\n**Step 3: Sort the arrays**\n\nOnce we have the intersection and union Sets, we can convert them back to arrays and sort them.\n\n- Use the `Array.from()` method to convert Sets to arrays.\n\n- Use the `sort()` method with a comparator to sort the arrays in ascending order.\n\n**Step 4: Return the results**\n\nYou can return an object with properties like `intersection` and `union`, each holding the respective sorted array.\n\nAlternatively, you can return an array containing two arrays, one for intersection and one for union.\n\nNow, let's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- Empty arrays: What if one or both arrays are empty?\n\n- Duplicate elements: Although Sets handle uniqueness, we need to ensure that duplicates within an array don't affect the intersection and union.\n\n- Negative numbers: The arrays can contain negative integers, so the sorting should handle negative values correctly.\n\n- Non-integer values: The prompt specifies arrays of integers, but we should consider if the arrays might contain non-integer values.\n\nAssuming that the arrays strictly contain integers, we can proceed.\n\nLet's sketch a rough code outline:\n\n```javascript\nfunction arrayOperations(arr1, arr2) {\n    // Find intersection\n    const set1 = new Set(arr1);\n    const set2 = new Set(arr2);\n    const intersection = [...set1].filter(item => set2.has(item));\n    \n    // Find union\n    const union = [...new Set([...arr1, ...arr2])];\n    \n    // Sort both arrays\n    intersection.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    union.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    \n    // Return the results\n    return {\n        intersection: intersection,\n        union: union\n    };\n}\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. Let's test this function with some examples to verify.\n\n**Test Case 1:**\n\nInput:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\n\narr2 = [2, 3, 4]\n\nExpected Output:\n\n{\n\n  intersection: [2, 3],\n\n  union: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n}\n\n**Test Case 2:**\n\nInput:\n\narr1 = [5, 6, 7]\n\narr2 = [7, 8, 9]\n\nExpected Output:\n\n{\n\n  intersection: [7],\n\n  union: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n}\n\n**Test Case 3:**\n\nInput:\n\narr1 = []\n\narr2 = [1, 2, 3]\n\nExpected Output:\n\n{\n\n  intersection: [],\n\n  union: [1, 2, 3]\n\n}\n\n**Test Case 4:**\n\nInput:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\n\narr2 = []\n\nExpected Output:\n\n{\n\n  intersection: [],\n\n  union: [1, 2, 3]\n\n}\n\n**Test Case 5:**\n\nInput:\n\narr1 = [1, 1, 2, 2]\n\narr2 = [2, 3, 4]\n\nExpected Output:\n\n{\n\n  intersection: [2],\n\n  union: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n}\n\nSeems like the function handles these cases correctly.\n\nWait a minute, in Test Case 5, arr1 has duplicate elements. Since we're using Sets, duplicates should be automatically handled, which is good.\n\nAlso, the sorting should work correctly with negative numbers.\n\n**Test Case 6:**\n\nInput:\n\narr1 = [-1, -2, 3]\n\narr2 = [-2, 4, 5]\n\nExpected Output:\n\n{\n\n  intersection: [-2],\n\n  union: [-2, -1, 3, 4, 5]\n\n}\n\nYes, the sorting is correct because we're using `(a, b) => a - b`, which sorts numbers in ascending order, handling negatives properly.\n\nNow, considering that the prompt specifies \"arrays of integers\", but to make the function more robust, we could add some input validation to ensure that both parameters are arrays and contain only integers.\n\nHowever, for the sake of simplicity, and assuming that the input will be as specified, we can proceed without validation.\n\nIs there any way to optimize this further?\n\nWell, using Sets is already quite efficient, as Set operations in JavaScript are generally fast.\n\nBut if we want to be more efficient in terms of space complexity, we could avoid creating multiple Sets, but in practice, the difference is negligible unless dealing with very large arrays.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the `filter` method for intersection and the `concat` method combined with a Set for union, but the current approach is clean and straightforward.\n\nI think this should work well.\n\nLet me think about the return format. The prompt says to return a new array containing both intersection and union. However, in my initial approach, I returned an object with two properties.\n\nPerhaps I should adjust that to return an array containing two arrays: first the intersection, then the union.\n\nFor example:\n\n[\n\n  [2, 3],  // intersection\n\n  [1, 2, 3, 4]  // union\n\n]\n\nThat would satisfy the requirement of returning a new array containing their intersection and union.\n\nSo, I'll adjust the function accordingly.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n- Find intersection using Set operations.\n\n- Find union using Set operations.\n\n- Sort both arrays.\n\n- Return a new array containing first the intersection, then the union.\n\nHere's the adjusted code:\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction arrayOperations(arr1, arr2) {\n\n    // Find intersection\n\n    const set1 = new Set(arr1);\n\n    const set2 = new Set(arr2);\n\n    const intersection = [...set1].filter(item => set2.has(item));\n\n    \n\n    // Find union\n\n    const union = [...new Set([...arr1, ...arr2])];\n\n    \n\n    // Sort both arrays\n\n    intersection.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n    union.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n    \n\n    // Return a new array containing both intersection and union\n\n    return [intersection, union];\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis should work as expected.\n\nLet's verify with Test Case 1:\n\nInput:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\n\narr2 = [2, 3, 4]\n\nOutput:\n\n[\n\n  [2, 3],\n\n  [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n]\n\nWhich matches the expected output.\n\nSimilarly, for Test Case 2:\n\nInput:\n\narr1 = [5, 6, 7]\n\narr2 = [7, 8, 9]\n\nOutput:\n\n[\n\n  [7],\n\n  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n]\n\nLooks good.\n\nFor edge cases like empty arrays, it also behaves correctly.\n\nI think this function should\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u8bf7\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff01\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that takes two arrays of integers and returns a new array containing their intersection (common elements) and union (all unique elements from both arrays), both sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Find Intersection**:\n   - Use Sets to identify common elements efficiently.\n\n2. **Find Union**:\n   - Combine both arrays and use a Set to ensure all elements are unique.\n\n3. **Sort the Results**:\n   - Convert the Sets back to arrays and sort them in ascending order.\n\n4. **Return the Results**:\n   - Return a new array containing both the intersection and the union arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction arrayOperations(arr1, arr2) {\n    // Find intersection\n    const set1 = new Set(arr1);\n    const set2 = new Set(arr2);\n    const intersection = [...set1].filter(item => set2.has(item));\n    \n    // Find union\n    const union = [...new Set([...arr1, ...arr2])];\n    \n    // Sort both arrays\n    intersection.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    union.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    \n    // Return a new array containing both intersection and union\n    return [intersection, union];\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst arr1 = [1, 2, 3];\nconst arr2 = [2, 3, 4];\nconsole.log(arrayOperations(arr1, arr2));  // Output: [[2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Intersection**:\n   - Convert both input arrays to Sets for efficient lookups.\n   - Use the `filter` method on one Set to retain only elements that exist in the other Set.\n\n2. **Union**:\n   - Concatenate both arrays and convert the result to a Set to remove duplicates.\n   - Convert the Set back to an array.\n\n3. **Sorting**:\n   - Sort both the intersection and union arrays using the `sort` method with a comparator function to ensure ascending order.\n\n4. **Return**:\n   - Return a new array where the first element is the intersection array and the second element is the union array."
