Each plan step will produce an evidence value, which is the output of a specific tool function given an input string that could be the original query, prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables users to perform searches using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It's helpful for identifying potential sources that might contain the answer to the user's query.\nTextParser[input]: Takes one or more website URLs from the input string (separated by newlines) and outputs plain text containing the content of those pages.\nHyperlinkHarvester[input]: Harvests hyperlinks from plain text and returns them as a newline-separated plain text response.\nInfoBot[input]: A question-answering AI model adept at answering queries based on a provided context. The input should be a question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [Initial action based on input query]\n:evidence0: = [Function to invoke with relevant parameters]\nPlan: [Subsequent action based on outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to invoke with its parameters, possibly referring to earlier evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: containing the ultimate answer]\n\nQuestion: Who wrote \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and what other works did they publish?"
