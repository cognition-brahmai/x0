        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a garden. The garden is rectangular, and it measures 30 meters in length and 20 meters in width. The gardener wants to increase the area by 50%, but he's only going to extend the length. I need to figure out what the new dimensions should be.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the current area of the garden is. Since it's a rectangle, the area is length times width, right? So, 30 meters times 20 meters would be 600 square meters. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the gardener wants to increase the area by 50%. So, I need to calculate what 50% of 600 square meters is. Half of 600 is 300, so increasing by 50% means adding 300 square meters to the current area. That would make the new area 600 plus 300, which is 900 square meters.\n\nOkay, so the new area should be 900 square meters. But the gardener is only going to extend the length, not the width. The width stays the same at 20 meters, and only the length increases.\n\nLet me denote the new length as L. The width remains 20 meters, so the new area is L times 20, which should equal 900 square meters. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nL * 20 = 900\n\nNow, to find L, I just need to divide both sides of the equation by 20.\n\nL = 900 / 20\n\nL = 45 meters\n\nSo, the new length should be 45 meters, and the width remains 20 meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The original area is 30 * 20 = 600 square meters. The new area should be 900 square meters. If the new length is 45 meters and the width is still 20 meters, then 45 * 20 equals 900 square meters. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the percentage increase in length. The original length is 30 meters, and the new length is 45 meters. So, the increase in length is 15 meters. To find the percentage increase:\n\n(15 / 30) * 100% = 50%\n\nSo, by increasing the length by 50% from 30 meters to 45 meters, the area increases by 50% from 600 square meters to 900 square meters.\n\nThat seems consistent. But the problem says \"increase the area by 50%,\" and I've achieved that by increasing the length by 50% while keeping the width the same.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using proportions or something like that.\n\nLet's see, if I let the new length be L, and the width remains 20 meters, then the new area is L * 20. I want this to be 50% more than the original area.\n\nSo, L * 20 = 600 * 1.5\n\nAgain, that's L * 20 = 900\n\nSolving for L gives L = 45 meters, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the area formula and the percentage increase directly.\n\nThe area increases by 50%, so the new area is 150% of the original area.\n\nSince only the length is increasing and the width stays the same, the new length must be such that when multiplied by the original width, it gives the new area.\n\nSo, new length = (new area) / (original width) = (1.5 * original area) / original width\n\nBut original area is length times width, so:\n\nNew length = (1.5 * L * W) / W = 1.5 * L\n\nWhich again shows that the new length is 1.5 times the original length, meaning a 50% increase in length.\n\nSo, all these approaches lead me to the same conclusion: the new length should be 45 meters, and the width remains 20 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any constraint on how much the length can be extended? The problem doesn't specify any limitations, so assuming there are no practical constraints, extending the length to 45 meters should work.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the unit is consistent\u2014everything is in meters, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, if the gardener chose to extend both length and width, there would be multiple solutions, but the problem specifies that only the length is to be extended.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the new dimensions of the garden should be 45 meters in length and 20 meters in width.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45 \\text{ meters in length and } 20 \\text{ meters in width}} \\]"
