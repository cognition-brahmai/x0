        "content": "So I've got this math problem here: (6 / 2)^2 * (5 - 3) + 4. Hmm, let's see how to approach this. I remember that in math, there's an order of operations, often abbreviated as PEMDAS or BODMAS or something like that. PeMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, I should start by handling what's inside the parentheses.\n\nFirst, there's (6 / 2). That's straightforward; 6 divided by 2 is 3. So, that part becomes 3. Now, the expression is 3^2 * (5 - 3) + 4.\n\nNext, exponentiation. 3 squared is 9. So now it's 9 * (5 - 3) + 4.\n\nThen, another set of parentheses: (5 - 3) is 2. So now the expression is 9 * 2 + 4.\n\nNow, multiplication and addition. According to PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition, so 9 multiplied by 2 is 18. Then, 18 plus 4 is 22.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall seeing somewhere that division and multiplication have the same precedence and should be done from left to right. Similarly, addition and subtraction are at the same level. So, in this case, division comes first, followed by exponentiation, then multiplication, and finally addition.\n\nLet me double-check. Starting with (6 / 2)^2 * (5 - 3) + 4.\n\nFirst, division: 6 / 2 = 3.\n\nThen, exponentiation: 3^2 = 9.\n\nNext, subtraction in parentheses: 5 - 3 = 2.\n\nThen, multiplication: 9 * 2 = 18.\n\nFinally, addition: 18 + 4 = 22.\n\nYes, that seems correct. But I've heard about people making mistakes with division and multiplication, so maybe I should consider if there's any ambiguity here.\n\nWait, sometimes people might misinterpret expressions like this, especially if it's written without proper formatting. For example, if it's written as 6 / 2 * (5 - 3) + 4, some might think that the division applies to the entire rest of the expression, but that's not the case according to standard order of operations.\n\nIn this case, the expression is (6 / 2)^2 * (5 - 3) + 4, which is clear. The division is within the parentheses and is performed first.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Compute (6 / 2) = 3\n\n2. Compute 3^2 = 9\n\n3. Compute (5 - 3) = 2\n\n4. Multiply 9 * 2 = 18\n\n5. Add 18 + 4 = 22\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 22.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this expression. For example, someone might mistakenly think that exponentiation applies only to the denominator in the division, but no, exponents apply to the result of the division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the order of operations. Let's recall the PEMDAS rule:\n\n- Parentheses\n\n- Exponents\n\n- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n\n- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nFollowing this rule, the steps I took seem correct.\n\nAnother way to confirm is to use a calculator or a programming language that follows standard mathematical conventions. If I input (6 / 2)^2 * (5 - 3) + 4 into a calculator, it should return 22.\n\nAlternatively, if I write this expression in a programming language like Python, it should evaluate to 22 as well.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\n(6 / 2)**2 * (5 - 3) + 4\n\nFirst, 6 / 2 is 3.0 (since division in Python returns a float).\n\nThen, 3.0^2 is 9.0.\n\nNext, 5 - 3 is 2.\n\nThen, 9.0 * 2 is 18.0.\n\nFinally, 18.0 + 4 is 22.0.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the answer is 22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]"
