        "content": "Let's see. There are 8 people in the room, including Mary and John. Half of them wear glasses, and half don't. So, that means 4 people wear glasses and 4 don't.\n\nAmong those who wear glasses, two-thirds are women. So, if 4 people wear glasses, then two-thirds of 4 is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3} \\), which is approximately 2.666. But you can't have a fraction of a person, so maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of whole numbers. If 4 people wear glasses and two-thirds are women, then the number of women wearing glasses should be a whole number. Let me check if 4 can be divided into two-thirds.\n\nActually, 4 divided into two-thirds would be \\( 4 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{3} \\), which isn't a whole number. That doesn't make sense in this context. Maybe there's a mistake in the interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implies that exactly two-thirds of the glass-wearers are women. But since two-thirds of 4 is not a whole number, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is designed such that the numbers work out to whole people. Perhaps I need to consider that the descriptions might imply specific counts.\n\nLet me try again. There are 8 people: 4 with glasses and 4 without.\n\nAmong the 4 with glasses, two-thirds are women. So, number of women with glasses is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3} \\), which is not a whole number. This suggests that perhaps the problem has an implicit assumption that the numbers work out to whole people, so maybe I should consider that the descriptions are approximate or that I'm misinterpreting something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is set up in a way that the numbers do work out cleanly, so maybe I need to consider that the \"half of them wear glasses\" might not be exactly half, but in this case, 8 divided by 2 is 4, which is fine.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the descriptions of fractions might involve rounding. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is constructed such that the numbers are consistent and result in whole people. So, perhaps the \"two-thirds\" is meant to be exact, implying that the number of glass-wearing women is a whole number.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial assumption that half wear glasses and half don't is not strictly exact, but since 8 is even, it's 4 and 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's assign variables.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Total people: 8\n\n- People with glasses: 4\n\n- People without glasses: 4\n\nAmong those with glasses:\n\n- Women with glasses: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3} \\), which is not a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the problem has a mistake or is impossible as stated, but I assume it's solvable, so maybe I need to consider that the \"two-thirds\" is approximate or that I need to find a way to interpret it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about probabilities or expected values, but it seems to be about counting people.\n\nWait, maybe the problem allows for non-integer results, but that doesn't make sense for people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"half of them wear glasses\" is not exactly half, but in this case, 8 divided by 2 is 4, which is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the two-thirds among glass-wearers refers to a specific count that works out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have exact numbers, so maybe I need to consider that the description implies specific counts.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the number of glass-wearers is such that two-thirds are women, and three-quarters of the non-glass-wearers are men.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of people who wear glasses.\n\n- Then, the number of people who don't wear glasses is \\( 8 - g \\).\n\nAmong the glass-wearers:\n\n- Women: \\( \\frac{2}{3} g \\)\n\n- Men: \\( g - \\frac{2}{3} g = \\frac{1}{3} g \\)\n\nAmong the non-glass-wearers:\n\n- Men: \\( \\frac{3}{4} (8 - g) \\)\n\n- Women: \\( (8 - g) - \\frac{3}{4} (8 - g) = \\frac{1}{4} (8 - g) \\)\n\nNow, since the number of men and women must be integers, \\( g \\) must be a multiple of 3 for \\( \\frac{1}{3} g \\) to be an integer, and \\( 8 - g \\) must be a multiple of 4 for \\( \\frac{3}{4} (8 - g) \\) to be an integer.\n\nSo, \\( g \\) must be a multiple of 3, and \\( 8 - g \\) must be a multiple of 4.\n\nLet's find \\( g \\) such that:\n\n1. \\( g \\) is a multiple of 3.\n\n2. \\( 8 - g \\) is a multiple of 4.\n\nPossible values of \\( g \\):\n\n- \\( g = 0 \\): then \\( 8 - 0 = 8 \\), which is a multiple of 4.\n\n- \\( g = 3 \\): \\( 8 - 3 = 5 \\), which is not a multiple of 4.\n\n- \\( g = 6 \\): \\( 8 - 6 = 2 \\), which is not a multiple of 4.\n\n- \\( g = 9 \\): greater than 8, so not possible.\n\nThus, the only possible value is \\( g = 0 \\), but that would mean no one wears glasses, which contradicts the \"half of them wear glasses\" statement, since half of 8 is 4.\n\nWait a minute, there's a contradiction here. The problem states that half of them wear glasses, which is 4, but according to the above, \\( g \\) must be 0 for \\( 8 - g \\) to be a multiple of 4, but 0 doesn't satisfy the half-wearing-glasses condition.\n\nThis suggests that there is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions, which would mean the problem has no solution as stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that \\( g \\) must be a multiple of 3 for \\( \\frac{2}{3} g \\) to be an integer. Actually, \\( \\frac{2}{3} g \\) being an integer implies that \\( g \\) is a multiple of 3, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\frac{3}{4} (8 - g) \\) being an integer implies that \\( 8 - g \\) is a multiple of 4, which is also correct.\n\nGiven that, the only possible \\( g \\) is 0, but that contradicts the half-wearing-glasses condition.\n\nTherefore, the problem as stated has no solution because the conditions are inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for non-integer counts, but that doesn't make sense for people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fractions are approximations, but again, in the context of counting people, we need whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated or missing some information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that Mary and John are part of specific groups.\n\nWait, the problem mentions Mary and John, but doesn't specify anything about them other than them being in the room. So, I don't think they are directly relevant to the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have a specific answer, and I need to find a way to make the numbers work.\n\nLet me try assuming that \\( g = 4 \\), as half of 8 is 4, and see what happens.\n\nIf \\( g = 4 \\):\n\n- Women with glasses: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3} \\), which is approximately 2.666, not a whole number.\n\n- Men with glasses: \\( 4 - \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} \\), again not a whole number.\n\n- Men without glasses: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times (8 - 4) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4 = 3 \\)\n\n- Women without glasses: \\( 4 - 3 = 1 \\)\n\nTotal women: \\( \\frac{8}{3} + 1 = \\frac{11}{3} \\), which is approximately 3.666, not a whole number.\n\nThis doesn't make sense for counting people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round the numbers or consider expected values, but again, that doesn't align with counting whole people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total number of women in the room.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Total women: \\( w \\)\n\n- Total men: \\( 8 - w \\)\n\nNow, among the glass-wearers:\n\n- Women: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3} \\)\n\n- Men: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{4}{3} \\)\n\nAmong the non-glass-wearers:\n\n- Men: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4 = 3 \\)\n\n- Women: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 4 = 1 \\)\n\nSo, total women: \\( \\frac{8}{3} + 1 = \\frac{11}{3} \\), which is approximately 3.666, not a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that the problem's conditions are inconsistent and cannot be satisfied with whole numbers, which is necessary for counting people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different way to interpret the fractions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have a whole number solution, and I need to find a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that the descriptions of fractions might be applied to different groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to set up equations based on the given fractions.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of people who wear glasses. Given that half wear glasses, \\( g = 4 \\).\n\n- Number of women who wear glasses: \\( \\frac{2}{3} g = \\frac{8}{3} \\), not an integer.\n\nSince this isn't an integer, perhaps the problem is misstated or impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"half of them wear glasses\" is not exactly half, but in this case, with 8 people, it should be 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for partial people, but that doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fractions are meant to be approximate, and I should consider the closest whole numbers.\n\nIf I consider \\( g = 4 \\), and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.666 \\), perhaps I can round to 3 women wearing glasses.\n\nBut then men wearing glasses would be \\( 4 - 3 = 1 \\).\n\nAmong the 4 without glasses:\n\n- Men: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4 = 3 \\)\n\n- Women: \\( 4 - 3 = 1 \\)\n\nTotal women: 3 (with glasses) + 1 (without glasses) = 4\n\nTotal men: 1 (with glasses) + 3 (without glasses) = 4\n\nThis seems consistent, with 4 women and 4 men in total.\n\nAlternatively, if I round down to 2 women with glasses:\n\n- Women with glasses: 2\n\n- Men with glasses: 2\n\n- Men without glasses: 3\n\n- Women without glasses: 1\n\nTotal women: 3, total men: 5, which is not equal, but the problem doesn't specify equal numbers of men and women.\n\nBut in the first rounding up, with 3 women with glasses and 1 without, total women is 4, which is plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects exact fractions, and since exact fractions don't yield whole numbers, it has no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have a specific answer, and I need to accept the fractional people for the sake of the problem.\n\nBut that seems unrealistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about probabilities, but it seems to be about counting people.\n\nGiven that, I think the problem might have an inconsistency in its conditions, leading to fractional people, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the descriptions are not exact, and approximate the numbers.\n\nIn that case, with \\( g = 4 \\), and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.666 \\), perhaps the intended number of women with glasses is 3, and men with glasses is 1, as before.\n\nThen, total women would be 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is 4 women in the room.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have no solution, but I doubt that.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with the approximation that there are 4 women in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
