        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bacteria colony that doubles in size every hour, and it takes 5 hours to fill a petri dish. The question is, when was the dish half full?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the growth pattern of the bacteria. Since it doubles every hour, this sounds like exponential growth. So, the size of the colony at any time can be represented by an exponential function.\n\nLet me denote the size of the colony at time t as S(t), where t is in hours. Given that the colony doubles every hour, we can write:\n\nS(t) = S(0) * 2^t\n\nwhere S(0) is the initial size of the colony.\n\nNow, we're told that the dish is full after 5 hours. So, S(5) is the full dish.\n\nWe need to find the time t when the dish was half full. That would be S(t) = S(5)/2.\n\nUsing the exponential growth formula:\n\nS(t) = S(0) * 2^t\n\nand\n\nS(5) = S(0) * 2^5\n\nTherefore, S(5)/2 = [S(0) * 2^5]/2 = S(0) * 2^(5-1) = S(0) * 2^4\n\nSo, S(t) = S(0) * 2^4\n\nComparing this with S(t) = S(0) * 2^t, we get t = 4 hours.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let me think if there are other factors to consider.\n\nIs it possible that the growth rate changes over time? The problem says the colony doubles every hour, so the growth rate is constant. Therefore, the exponential model should hold.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the capacity of the petri dish. Maybe as the colony grows, it starts to face resource limitations, which could affect the growth rate. But the problem states that it doubles every hour and takes 5 hours to fill the dish, so perhaps we can assume that the exponential growth holds until the dish is full.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the doubling time changes as the colony grows. But again, the problem specifies that it doubles every hour, so I think the doubling time is constant.\n\nLet me consider if there's a possibility of lag phase or any other growth phases that bacteria typically go through. In a typical bacterial growth curve, there's a lag phase, exponential phase, stationary phase, and death phase. However, the problem seems to suggest that the growth is exponential throughout the 5 hours, as it doubles every hour and fills the dish in that time.\n\nSo, based on the exponential growth model, the dish is half full one hour before it's full. Therefore, at t=4 hours, the dish is half full.\n\nBut let's think about this intuitively. If the colony doubles every hour, then going from t=4 to t=5, the size would double, filling the dish at t=5. Therefore, at t=4, it must have been half full.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider t=3, the size would be quarter full, since it doubles to half at t=4 and then to full at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2, it would be an eighth full, and so on.\n\nSo, according to this, t=4 hours is when the dish was half full.\n\nBut maybe there are other interpretations. For example, perhaps the doubling time changes as the colony approaches the dish's capacity. In real-world scenarios, bacterial growth eventually slows down as resources become limited, leading to a logistic growth curve rather than exponential growth.\n\nIf that's the case, then the doubling time would not be constant, and the time at which the dish was half full might not be t=4 hours.\n\nLet me explore this possibility.\n\nIn logistic growth, the growth rate decreases as the population approaches the carrying capacity, which is the maximum population size that the environment can sustain.\n\nThe logistic growth curve is S-shaped, with an initial exponential phase, followed by a deceleration as the population approaches the carrying capacity.\n\nIn this model, the population grows fastest at around 50% of the carrying capacity.\n\nSo, if the dish is full at t=5 hours, and growth is logistic, then the population would have been growing most rapidly around t=2.5 hours, and the growth rate would slow down as it approaches t=5 hours.\n\nIn this case, the dish would have been half full before t=5 hours, but not necessarily at t=4 hours.\n\nTo model this, we can use the logistic growth equation:\n\nS(t) = K / (1 + (K/S(0) - 1) * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere:\n\n- S(t) is the size at time t\n\n- K is the carrying capacity (full dish)\n\n- S(0) is the initial size\n\n- r is the intrinsic growth rate\n\nGiven that the colony doubles every hour in the initial stages, we can assume that r is such that S(t) doubles every hour when S(t) is small compared to K.\n\nHowever, this is getting complicated, and the problem seems to suggest simple exponential growth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a time delay or some other factor affecting the growth rate.\n\nBut based on the information provided, the simplest and most straightforward answer is that the dish was half full at t=4 hours.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the dish was half full after 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
