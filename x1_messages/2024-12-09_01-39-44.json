        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces widgets at a rate of 500 per hour. They decide to increase production by 20% every week due to higher demand. We need to find out how many widgets they'll produce in the third week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The factory increases its production rate by 20% each week. So, each week, their production rate is 120% of the previous week's rate. We need to find the production in the third week.\n\nLet's break it down week by week.\n\n**Week 1:**\n\n- Initial production rate: 500 widgets per hour.\n\n- No increase yet, so they produce at 500 widgets per hour.\n\nBut wait, the problem says they increase production by 20% every week starting from the first week. So, does that mean the first increase happens at the end of the first week?\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"They decide to increase production by 20% every week.\"\n\nThis might be a bit ambiguous. Does the increase happen at the end of each week, or at the start of each subsequent week?\n\nAssuming that the increase happens at the end of each week, meaning that each week they produce at the current rate and then increase at the end of the week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production rate for each week is based on the increased rate effective at the start of that week.\n\nI think the latter makes more sense in terms of planning production.\n\nSo, let's assume that the production rate for each week is set at the start of the week, and it's increased by 20% each week compared to the previous week.\n\nGiven that, let's define:\n\n- Week 1: Starting production rate, no increase yet.\n\n- Week 2: Production rate increased by 20% from Week 1.\n\n- Week 3: Production rate increased by 20% from Week 2.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"they decide to increase production by 20% every week.\" It might be interpreted that the increase starts immediately in the first week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production rate is 500 per hour, and then each week, including the first, production increases by 20%.\n\nI think to avoid confusion, I'll assume that the production rate for Week 1 is 500 per hour, and then at the end of Week 1, they increase production by 20%, which will be the rate for Week 2, and so on.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider another approach.\n\nIf the factory increases production by 20% every week, starting from the initial rate of 500 per hour, then:\n\n- Week 1: 500 widgets per hour.\n\n- Week 2: 500 * 1.20 = 600 widgets per hour.\n\n- Week 3: 600 * 1.20 = 720 widgets per hour.\n\nSo, in the third week, they produce at a rate of 720 widgets per hour.\n\nBut wait, the question is to find out how many widgets they produce in the third week, not just the production rate.\n\nI need to calculate the total production for the entire week.\n\nAssuming the factory operates continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the total production in a week would be:\n\nProduction rate per hour * hours per day * days per week.\n\nSo, for Week 3:\n\n720 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 7 days/week.\n\nBut hold on, the problem doesn't specify the operating hours of the factory. Maybe they don't operate 24/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production rate is given per hour, but the number of hours they operate per week is not specified.\n\nThis is a problem because without knowing how many hours the factory operates in a week, I can't calculate the total production for the week.\n\nWait, maybe the factory operates a standard 40-hour workweek.\n\nMany factories operate 40 hours per week, with days off.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nTotal production in Week 3 = 720 widgets/hour * 40 hours/week.\n\nBut I should confirm if this assumption is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory operates more hours per week.\n\nTo be precise, I need to know the exact operating hours per week.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify, I'll make an assumption based on standard practices.\n\nIn many manufacturing settings, a standard workweek is 40 hours.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with that assumption unless there's a compelling reason to think otherwise.\n\nTherefore, total production in Week 3:\n\n720 widgets/hour * 40 hours/week = 28,800 widgets.\n\nWait, but this seems straightforward. Is there more to this problem?\n\nLet me re-read it: \"A factory produces widgets at a rate of 500 per hour. Due to increased demand, they decide to increase production by 20% every week. How many widgets will they produce in the third week?\"\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any change in operating hours, only in the production rate per hour.\n\nTherefore, if the factory operates the same number of hours each week, just at an increased production rate per hour, then my calculation should hold.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nPerhaps the 20% increase is compounded weekly, meaning that each week's production rate is 20% more than the previous week's rate.\n\nYes, that's what I've already assumed.\n\nSo, Week 1: 500 widgets/hour.\n\nWeek 2: 500 * 1.20 = 600 widgets/hour.\n\nWeek 3: 600 * 1.20 = 720 widgets/hour.\n\nThen, total production in Week 3 is 720 widgets/hour * number of hours in the week.\n\nAssuming 40 hours per week, that's 720 * 40 = 28,800 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory operates different hours each week, or if there are other factors like machine breakdowns or labor issues, that could affect production.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention any of that, I'll assume ideal conditions.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the factory operates 24/7, without downtime.\n\nIn that case, hours per week would be 24 hours/day * 7 days/week = 168 hours/week.\n\nThen, total production in Week 3 would be 720 widgets/hour * 168 hours/week = 120,960 widgets.\n\nBut again, this assumes 24/7 operation, which may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory operates only during standard business hours, say 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is 40 hours per week, as I initially assumed.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in operating hours, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"per hour\" production rate is meant to be integrated over the entire week, assuming continuous production.\n\nBut without explicit information, it's challenging to decide.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to calculate the total production in the third week based solely on the hourly rate and the weekly time frame, assuming continuous production.\n\nIn that case, total production in Week 3 would be 720 widgets/hour * 168 hours/week = 120,960 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the factory increases its production rate by 20% each week, but the increase is applied to the total production of the previous week, not to the hourly rate.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense, because the production rate is given per hour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increase is compounded weekly on the hourly rate.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"increase production by 20% every week,\" which logically applies to the production rate per hour.\n\nTherefore, each week, the hourly production rate increases by 20%.\n\nSo, Week 1: 500 widgets/hour.\n\nWeek 2: 500 * 1.20 = 600 widgets/hour.\n\nWeek 3: 600 * 1.20 = 720 widgets/hour.\n\nThen, to find the total production in Week 3, I need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours the factory operates in that week.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in operating hours, perhaps the problem expects a different approach or provides additional information that I've overlooked.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that the factory operates a constant number of hours each week, and only the production rate per hour changes.\n\nIn that case, the total production each week would increase by 20% compared to the previous week.\n\nWait, but that's different from increasing the production rate per hour by 20% each week.\n\nIf the factory operates the same number of hours each week, and only the production rate per hour increases by 20% each week, then the total production each week would increase by 20% compared to the previous week.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory increases its operating hours by 20% each week, while keeping the production rate per hour constant, that would also lead to a 20% increase in total production each week.\n\nBut the problem states \"increase production by 20% every week,\" which likely refers to total production, not just the production rate per hour.\n\nHowever, the production rate is given per hour, suggesting that the production rate per hour increases by 20% each week.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nInitial production rate: 500 widgets per hour.\n\nWeekly increase: 20% increase in production rate per hour.\n\nFind: Total production in the third week.\n\nAssuming the factory operates the same number of hours each week, say H hours per week.\n\nThen:\n\n- Week 1 production: 500 widgets/hour * H hours = 500H widgets.\n\n- Week 2 production rate: 500 * 1.20 = 600 widgets/hour.\n\n- Week 2 production: 600 * H = 600H widgets.\n\n- Week 3 production rate: 600 * 1.20 = 720 widgets/hour.\n\n- Week 3 production: 720 * H = 720H widgets.\n\nBut without knowing H, I can't find a numerical value for the third week's production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to express the third week's production in terms of the first week's production.\n\nIn that case, since each week production increases by 20%, the production each week is 1.20 times the previous week's production.\n\nSo:\n\n- Week 1: P1 = 500H.\n\n- Week 2: P2 = P1 * 1.20 = 500H * 1.20 = 600H.\n\n- Week 3: P3 = P2 * 1.20 = 600H * 1.20 = 720H.\n\nSo, P3 = 720H widgets.\n\nBut again, without knowing H, I can't find a numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to calculate the total production over the third week based on the increased hourly rate, assuming a standard number of hours.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify operating hours, perhaps it's assumed to be a standard 40-hour workweek.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nH = 40 hours/week.\n\nTherefore, P3 = 720 widgets/hour * 40 hours/week = 28,800 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory operates more hours, say 168 hours per week (24/7), then P3 = 720 * 168 = 120,960 widgets.\n\nBut without specification, I'll stick with the 40-hour workweek assumption.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 28,800 widgets in the third week.\n\nWait, but this seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to calculate the cumulative production over the first three weeks, but the question specifically asks for the third week's production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"increase production by 20% every week\" means that the total production each week increases by 20% compared to the previous week, not just the production rate per hour.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Week 1 production: 500H.\n\n- Week 2 production: 500H * 1.20 = 600H.\n\n- Week 3 production: 600H * 1.20 = 720H.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nBut again, without knowing H, I can't find a numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to assume a certain number of hours per week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted differently.\n\nWait, perhaps \"increase production by 20% every week\" means that the production rate per hour increases by 20% each week, and the factory operates the same number of hours each week.\n\nIn that case, it's the same as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory increases its production rate per hour by 20% each week, and also increases its operating hours by some percentage, but that seems unlikely given the problem statement.\n\nGiven that, I think the safest approach is to assume a standard 40-hour workweek, calculate the production rate in the third week, and then find the total production for that week.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Hourly production rate in Week 3: 500 * (1.20)^2 = 500 * 1.44 = 720 widgets/hour.\n\n- Total production in Week 3: 720 widgets/hour * 40 hours/week = 28,800 widgets.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 28,800 widgets in the third week.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another scenario where the factory operates more hours per week.\n\nFor example, if the factory operates 8 hours per day, 5 days a week, that's 40 hours/week, as previously assumed.\n\nAlternatively, if it operates 10 hours per day, 7 days a week, that's 70 hours/week.\n\nIn that case, total production in Week 3 would be 720 * 70 = 50,400 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, if it operates 24/7, that's 168 hours/week, leading to 720 * 168 = 120,960 widgets.\n\nGiven the lack of specification, I think the standard 40-hour workweek is a reasonable assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to calculate the production increase without considering the operating hours, focusing solely on the hourly production rate increase.\n\nIn that case, the production rate in the third week is 500 * (1.20)^2 = 720 widgets/hour.\n\nBut without knowing the operating hours, I can't find the total production for the week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to assume a certain number of hours per week, such as 40 hours, as is commonly assumed in such problems if not specified otherwise.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the 40-hour workweek assumption.\n\nTherefore, total production in the third week is 720 * 40 = 28,800 widgets.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 28,800 widgets in the third week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28800} \\]"
