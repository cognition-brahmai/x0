        "content": "So I have this equation to solve: 2x + 4 = 16. I need to find the value of x. Let's see how to do this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should isolate the term with x on one side of the equation. To do that, I can subtract 4 from both sides. So, if I subtract 4 from both sides, the equation becomes:\n\n2x + 4 - 4 = 16 - 4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2x = 12\n\nNow, I need to solve for x, so I should divide both sides by 2:\n\n2x / 2 = 12 / 2\n\nThat gives me:\n\nx = 6\n\nLet me check if this is correct. If I plug x = 6 back into the original equation:\n\n2*(6) + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16\n\nYes, that matches the right side of the equation. So, x = 6 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
