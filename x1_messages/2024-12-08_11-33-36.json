        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, there are 120 people in total. According to the problem, 1/3 of these people have dogs. So, first, I need to find out how many people have dogs.\n\nTo do that, I'll multiply the total number of people by 1/3:\n\n120 * (1/3) = 40 people have dogs.\n\nNow, out of these 40 people who have dogs, 2/5 of them also have cats. So, I need to find out how many people that is.\n\nAgain, I'll multiply the number of dog owners by 2/5:\n\n40 * (2/5) = 16 people have both dogs and cats.\n\nSo, the answer should be 16 people.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way could be to first find out what fraction of the total population has both dogs and cats.\n\nWe know that 1/3 of the people have dogs, and among them, 2/5 also have cats. So, the fraction of people who have both dogs and cats would be:\n\n(1/3) * (2/5) = 2/15\n\nNow, applying this fraction to the total population:\n\n120 * (2/15) = 16 people\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation. So, definitely, 16 people have both dogs and cats.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try another method.\n\nLet's consider the number of people who have dogs but not cats, and those who have both.\n\nWe already know that 40 people have dogs.\n\nOut of these, 16 have both dogs and cats, so the number of people who have only dogs would be:\n\n40 - 16 = 24 people have only dogs.\n\nBut the problem doesn't ask for that, so maybe I don't need to go that far.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find out how many people have cats, but I don't have enough information to do that, since I don't know how many people have only cats or just cats without dogs.\n\nBut again, the question is only about how many have both dogs and cats, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer is definitely 16 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
