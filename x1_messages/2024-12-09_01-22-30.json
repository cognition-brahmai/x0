Below is a Python function that implements the insertion sort algorithm on a given list of numbers and returns the sorted list.\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key,\n        # to one position ahead of their current position\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Outer Loop**: Starts from the second element (index 1) and iterates through the list.\n2. **Key Element**: The current element to be positioned in the sorted portion of the list.\n3. **Inner Loop**: Shifts elements of the sorted segment forward if they are greater than the key.\n4. **Insertion**: Places the key into its correct position in the sorted segment.\n\nThis function sorts the list in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm."
