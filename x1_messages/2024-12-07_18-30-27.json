        "content": "So the library is planning a book fair and they need to figure out how many tables to set up to display their books. Each table can hold 25 books, and they have a total of 1,200 books to showcase. Also, the space available can accommodate up to 60 tables. I need to determine how many tables they should set up and whether there will be enough space to display all the books.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many tables are needed to display all 1,200 books, assuming each table holds 25 books. To do this, I can divide the total number of books by the number of books per table:\n\n1,200 books \u00f7 25 books/table = 48 tables\n\nSo, they would need 48 tables to display all 1,200 books.\n\nNow, I need to check if there is enough space to accommodate these 48 tables. The space available can hold up to 60 tables. Since 48 is less than 60, there is enough space.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if they should set up fewer tables. Maybe they want some tables for other purposes, like seating or activities. However, the question doesn't specify any other requirements, so I'll assume that all tables are for displaying books.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should check if 48 tables are exactly enough or if they need to round up. Since 25 books per table times 48 tables equals exactly 1,200 books, there's no need for an extra table.\n\nBut let me verify that:\n\n25 books/table \u00d7 48 tables = 1,200 books\n\nYes, it's exact.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, I'll check if there's any remainder when dividing 1,200 by 25.\n\n1,200 \u00f7 25 = 48 with no remainder.\n\nSo, no extra tables are needed.\n\nAdditionally, since the space can accommodate up to 60 tables, and they only need 48, they have some extra capacity.\n\nPerhaps they can use the extra space for other things, like seating, refreshments, or information desks. But again, the question seems to focus on displaying the books.\n\nI should also consider if all books are of the same size or if there are different sizes that might affect the number of books per table. But the problem states that each table can hold 25 books, so I'll assume that's a standard number regardless of book size.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all 1,200 books should be displayed at once, or if some can be rotated in and out. But again, the problem doesn't mention any rotation, so I'll assume they want to display all books simultaneously.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the library should set up 48 tables to display all 1,200 books, and there will be enough space since the venue can accommodate up to 60 tables.\n\nWait, but maybe I should express this in a more detailed manner.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of tables needed to display all books.\n\n   - Total books: 1,200\n\n   - Books per table: 25\n\n   - Tables needed: 1,200 \u00f7 25 = 48\n\n2. Check if the space can accommodate these tables.\n\n   - Maximum tables space can hold: 60\n\n   - Tables needed: 48\n\n   - Since 48 \u2264 60, there is enough space.\n\n3. Consider if there are any remainders or if additional tables are needed.\n\n   - 25 \u00d7 48 = 1,200, exact match, no remainder.\n\n4. Consider if there is extra space that could be used for other purposes.\n\n   - Extra tables available: 60 - 48 = 12\n\n   - But the question seems focused on displaying books, so perhaps that's beyond the scope.\n\nTherefore, the library should set up 48 tables, which will be sufficient to display all 1,200 books, and there will be enough space in the venue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
