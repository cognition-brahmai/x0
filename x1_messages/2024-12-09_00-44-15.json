        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a town with 600 adults in total. Among these adults, there are men and women. The problem states that 2/3 of the men are married to 3/4 of the women. We need to find out how many married couples there are in the town.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of men in the town as M and the number of women as W. Since there are only men and women in the town, we have:\n\nM + W = 600\n\nNow, according to the problem, 2/3 of the men are married. So, the number of married men is (2/3)M.\n\nSimilarly, 3/4 of the women are married, so the number of married women is (3/4)W.\n\nHere's the key point: These married men are married to these married women, meaning that the number of married couples is equal to the number of married men or the number of married women, since each married man is married to one married woman and vice versa. Therefore:\n\nNumber of married couples = (2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. M + W = 600\n\n2. (2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nWe can use these two equations to solve for M and W.\n\nLet's solve equation 2 for one of the variables. I'll solve for M in terms of W.\n\n(2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator on the left:\n\n2M = (9/4)W\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nM = (9/8)W\n\nNow, plug this expression for M into equation 1:\n\n(9/8)W + W = 600\n\nTo combine the terms on the left, first, express W as (8/8)W:\n\n(9/8)W + (8/8)W = 600\n\n(17/8)W = 600\n\nNow, solve for W by multiplying both sides by 8/17:\n\nW = 600 * (8/17)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n600 divided by 17 is approximately 35.2941, and multiplying by 8 gives approximately 282.3529.\n\nWait, but the number of women should be a whole number. It seems like there might be a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the steps.\n\nWe had:\n\nM + W = 600\n\nAnd\n\nM = (9/8)W\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n(9/8)W + W = 600\n\nCombining terms:\n\n(9/8 + 8/8)W = 600\n\n(17/8)W = 600\n\nThen, W = 600 * (8/17) = 4800/17 \u2248 282.3529\n\nBut since the number of women can't be a fraction, it seems there's an inconsistency here.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in assuming that M = (9/8)W. Let me re-examine that step.\n\nFrom (2/3)M = (3/4)W, we can cross-multiply to find the relationship between M and W.\n\n(2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nMultiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:\n\n12*(2/3)M = 12*(3/4)W\n\n8M = 9W\n\nTherefore, M = (9/8)W\n\nThis seems correct. So, if M + W = 600 and M = (9/8)W, then:\n\n(9/8)W + W = 600\n\n(17/8)W = 600\n\nW = 600 * (8/17) = 4800/17 \u2248 282.3529\n\nBut this is not a whole number, which is problematic because the number of women should be an integer.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the initial assumptions or the problem setup itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of adults isn't exclusively men and women. Maybe there are other adults, but the problem implies that there are only men and women.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe I can denote the number of married men and married women directly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nNumber of married men: (2/3)M\n\nNumber of married women: (3/4)W\n\nSince each married man is married to one married woman, these two quantities must be equal:\n\n(2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nAnd we have M + W = 600\n\nSo, again, we have the same two equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for men and women to be married to people outside the town, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem assumes that all married men are married to women in the town, and all married women are married to men in the town, with no outsiders.\n\nIn that case, the number of married men should equal the number of married women, which is what we already have.\n\nBut the issue remains that the equations lead to a non-integer solution, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that not all men and women are adults, but the problem says \"adults in the town,\" so I think it's safe to assume that M + W = 600.\n\nLet me try plugging in the value of W back into the equation for M.\n\nIf W = 4800/17, then M = 600 - 4800/17 = (10200 - 4800)/17 = 5400/17 \u2248 317.647\n\nAgain, not a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with the assumption that the number of men and women are integers, and that the equations must yield integer solutions.\n\nIn that case, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is implying that the number of adults includes people who are not men or women, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as all married individuals being part of married couples, with no single married individuals.\n\nBut that seems already accounted for in the equations.\n\nAnother approach: Let's denote the number of married couples as C.\n\nThen, the number of married men is C, and the number of married women is also C.\n\nGiven that (2/3)M = C and (3/4)W = C, we can set these equal to each other:\n\n(2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nAnd we have M + W = 600\n\nSo, again, the same equations.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express everything in terms of C.\n\nIf (2/3)M = C, then M = (3/2)C\n\nSimilarly, if (3/4)W = C, then W = (4/3)C\n\nNow, plugging into M + W = 600:\n\n(3/2)C + (4/3)C = 600\n\nTo combine these terms, find a common denominator, which is 6:\n\n(9/6)C + (8/6)C = 600\n\n(17/6)C = 600\n\nNow, solve for C:\n\nC = 600 * (6/17) = 3600/17 \u2248 211.7647\n\nAgain, not an integer, which is problematic.\n\nThis suggests that there is no integer number of married couples that satisfies the given conditions, which doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nPerhaps the problem is intended to be solved with non-integer values, but that seems unlikely for a problem about counting people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo or incorrect assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the town includes people who are married to each other but not necessarily to someone in the town, but that seems to complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that some men or women are not adults, but the problem states \"adults in the town,\" so I think M + W = 600 is correct.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that the number of married men and married women must both be integers, and that the equations force C to be a multiple of both 3 and 4, but that doesn't seem to help here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to adjust the numbers slightly to make them work.\n\nFor example, if we assume that M and W are such that (2/3)M and (3/4)W are both integers, then M must be a multiple of 3 and W must be a multiple of 4.\n\nLet\u2019s set M = 3k and W = 4m, where k and m are positive integers.\n\nThen, M + W = 3k + 4m = 600\n\nAlso, (2/3)M = 2k and (3/4)W = 3m must be equal since they represent the number of married couples.\n\nTherefore, 2k = 3m\n\nSo, k = (3/2)m\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation M + W = 3k + 4m = 600\n\nSubstitute k = (3/2)m:\n\n3*(3/2)m + 4m = 600\n\n(9/2)m + 4m = 600\n\nExpress 4m as (8/2)m:\n\n(9/2)m + (8/2)m = 600\n\n(17/2)m = 600\n\nNow, solve for m:\n\nm = 600 * (2/17) = 1200/17 \u2248 70.588\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that there is no integer solution for m, and consequently, no integer solution for k, M, W, or C.\n\nThis is frustrating because in reality, the number of men, women, and married couples must be whole numbers.\n\nPerhaps there's a different approach I should take.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the ratio of married men to total men is 2/3, and the ratio of married women to total women is 3/4.\n\nIf we let the number of married couples be C, then:\n\nC = (2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nFrom this, M = (3/2)C and W = (4/3)C\n\nNow, M + W = (3/2)C + (4/3)C = (9/6 + 8/6)C = (17/6)C = 600\n\nSo, C = 600 * (6/17) = 3600/17 \u2248 211.7647\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that the problem, as stated, doesn't have an integer solution, which is problematic for a real-world scenario involving people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nIn that case, C \u2248 212 married couples.\n\nBut then, checking back:\n\nM = (3/2)*212 = 318 men\n\nW = (4/3)*212 \u2248 282.6667 women\n\nBut 318 + 282.6667 = 600.6667, which doesn't add up to exactly 600.\n\nAlternatively, if we take C = 211:\n\nM = (3/2)*211 = 316.5 men\n\nW = (4/3)*211 \u2248 281.3333 women\n\nTotal = 316.5 + 281.3333 = 597.8333, which is below 600.\n\nSo, neither value of C gives exactly 600 adults.\n\nThis suggests that the problem, as stated, doesn't have a solution with whole numbers of men, women, and couples.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps it's intended to be solved with non-integer values, which doesn't make sense for counting people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fractions are meant to be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are people who are married outside of the town, which would complicate the relationships between married men and women.\n\nBut the problem states that 2/3 of the men are married to 3/4 of the women, which suggests that all married individuals are married within the town.\n\nGiven that, the earlier approach should hold, but it leads to a fractional number of people, which is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fractions are not directly comparable in the way I've assumed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that the number of married couples is equal to the minimum of (2/3)M and (3/4)W, but that doesn't align with the premise that these fractions are married to each other.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to consider a different approach entirely.\n\nLet\u2019s try to set up the equations differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nM: number of men\n\nW: number of women\n\nC: number of married couples\n\nGiven that M + W = 600\n\nAlso, given that (2/3)M = C and (3/4)W = C\n\nTherefore, (2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nFrom this, we can express M in terms of W:\n\nM = (3/4)W / (2/3) = (3/4)*(3/2)W = (9/8)W\n\nNow, plug into M + W = 600:\n\n(9/8)W + W = 600\n\n(17/8)W = 600\n\nW = 600 * (8/17) = 4800/17 \u2248 282.3529\n\nSimilarly, M = 600 - W = 600 - 4800/17 = (10200 - 4800)/17 = 5400/17 \u2248 317.647\n\nThen, C = (2/3)M = (2/3)*(5400/17) = 3600/17 \u2248 211.7647\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that the problem, as stated, doesn't have a solution with integer values for M, W, and C.\n\nPerhaps the problem is intended to be solved with approximate values, acknowledging that the fractions don't lead to whole numbers.\n\nIn that case, the number of married couples would be approximately 212.\n\nBut this seems unsatisfactory because you can't have a fraction of a couple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the number of men and women are such that the fractions work out to whole numbers.\n\nIn that case, perhaps we need to find values of M and W that are multiples of 3 and 4, respectively, to make (2/3)M and (3/4)W integers.\n\nBut as shown earlier, this leads to non-integer values for C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, and it should have different fractions that lead to integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that the ratio of men to women is 9:8, as derived earlier (M = 9/8 W), and then finding multiples that add up to 600.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nIf M:W = 9:8, then M = 9k and W = 8k for some integer k.\n\nThen, M + W = 9k + 8k = 17k = 600\n\nSolving for k: k = 600 / 17 \u2248 35.2941\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis reinforces the earlier conclusion that there is no integer solution for k, and therefore no integer values for M and W that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThis suggests that the problem, as stated, doesn't have a solution with whole numbers of men, women, and couples.\n\nPerhaps the problem is intended to be solved by accepting non-integer values, but that seems unrealistic for counting people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"2/3 of the men are married to 3/4 of the women.\"\n\nDoes this necessarily mean that every married man is married to one of these 3/4 of the women, and vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some men are married to more than one woman, or some women are married to more than one man, but that seems unlikely in a modern context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some men are married to women outside the town, or vice versa, but the problem states that they are married to 3/4 of the women and 2/3 of the men, respectively, which suggests that the marriages are within the town.\n\nGiven that, the earlier approach should hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fractions are not directly equatable because some men or women are married to multiple partners.\n\nBut in standard monogamous marriages, each married man is married to one woman, and each married woman is married to one man.\n\nTherefore, the number of married men should equal the number of married women.\n\nGiven that, the equations should hold, but they lead to non-integer solutions.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or in the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that the number of married couples is the minimum of (2/3)M and (3/4)W, but that doesn't align with the premise that these fractions are married to each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using systems of equations and accepting fractional values, but again, that seems unrealistic for counting people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of adults is not exactly 600, but approximately 600, allowing for rounding.\n\nIn that case, with M \u2248 317.647 and W \u2248 282.353, we could round M to 318 and W to 282, recognizing that 318 + 282 = 600.\n\nThen, C = (2/3)*318 = 212 married men, and C = (3/4)*282 = 211.5 married women.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that rounding leads to an inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the fractions are approximate, and to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nIn that case, with C \u2248 211.7647, we could round to 212 married couples.\n\nBut then, (2/3)M = 212 implies M = 318, and (3/4)W = 212 implies W = 282.6667, which isn't an integer.\n\nThis again leads to a inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that the number of men and women must be such that both (2/3)M and (3/4)W are integers, which would require M to be a multiple of 3 and W to be a multiple of 4.\n\nBut as shown earlier, this leads to non-integer values for C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem itself, and the fractions should be different to yield integer solutions.\n\nFor example, if the problem stated that 1/2 of the men are married to 1/2 of the women, then M + W = 600 and (1/2)M = (1/2)W, which would imply M = W = 300, and C = 150.\n\nBut that's not the problem at hand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by accepting that the number of married couples is a fractional value, and to interpret it as an average or expected value.\n\nBut again, that seems unrealistic for counting actual people.\n\nGiven all of this, perhaps the best approach is to accept the fractional value and report the number of married couples as approximately 212.\n\nHowever, since the problem is about counting people and couples, which must be whole numbers, this seems unsatisfactory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different way to interpret the fractions.\n\nFor example, maybe not all married men are married to the 3/4 of the women, but rather that 2/3 of the men are married, and among the women, 3/4 are married, but not necessarily to each other in a one-to-one correspondence.\n\nBut in standard marriage settings, each married man is married to one woman, and vice versa, so the number of married men should equal the number of married women.\n\nGiven that, the earlier approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some men or women are married multiple times, but that seems unlikely and outside the scope of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are unmarried men and women in the town, which is certainly possible, but the problem already accounts for that since not all men and women are married.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by setting up the equations and recognizing that there is no integer solution, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the arithmetic.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nFrom M + W = 600\n\nAnd (2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nSolving for M in terms of W:\n\n(2/3)M = (3/4)W\n\nM = (3/4)W / (2/3) = (3/4)*(3/2)W = (9/8)W\n\nThen, M + W = (9/8)W + W = (17/8)W = 600\n\nSo, W = 600 * (8/17) = 4800/17 \u2248 282.3529\n\nThen, M = 600 - W = 600 - 4800/17 = (10200 - 4800)/17 = 5400/17 \u2248 317.647\n\nThen, C = (2/3)M = (2/3)*(5400/17) = 3600/17 \u2248 211.7647\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that the problem, as stated, doesn't have an integer solution.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by accepting the fractional value and reporting C \u2248 212.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that the number of men and women must be such that both M and W are multiples of 3 and 4, respectively, to make (2/3)M and (3/4)W integers.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that.\n\nLet\u2019s set M = 3k and W = 4m, where k and m are positive integers.\n\nThen, M + W = 3k + 4m = 600\n\nAlso, (2/3)M = 2k and (3/4)W = 3m must be equal, so 2k = 3m\n\nTherefore, k = (3/2)m\n\nNow, substitute back into the equation:\n\n3*(3/2)m + 4m = 600\n\n(9/2)m + 4m = 600\n\nExpress 4m as (8/2)m:\n\n(9/2)m + (8/2)m = 600\n\n(17/2)m = 600\n\nSolve for m:\n\nm = 600 * (2/17) = 1200/17 \u2248 70.588\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nThis reinforces that there is no integer solution for m, and consequently, no integer solution for k, M, W, or C.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by accepting non-integer values, and the answer is approximately 212 married couples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in the problem statement, and the fractions should be different to yield integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that the number of married couples is the floor or ceiling of 3600/17, but that seems forced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of adults is not exactly 600, but close to it, allowing for adjustment.\n\nFor example, if the total number of adults were 595, then:\n\nM + W = 595\n\nM = (9/8)W\n\n(9/8)W + W = 595\n\n(17/8)W = 595\n\nW = 595 * (8/17) = 280\n\nThen, M = 595 - 280 = 315\n\nThen, C = (2/3)*315 = 210\n\nAnd C = (3/4)*280 = 210\n\nThis works out perfectly.\n\nSimilarly, if the total number of adults were 612:\n\nM + W = 612\n\nM = (9/8)W\n\n(9/8)W + W = 612\n\n(17/8)W = 612\n\nW = 612 * (8/17) = 288\n\nThen, M = 612 - 288 = 324\n\nThen, C = (2/3)*324 = 216\n\nAnd C = (3/4)*288 = 216\n\nAgain, this works out perfectly.\n\nBut since the problem states that the total number of adults is 600, which doesn't yield integer solutions, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by accepting that the number of married couples is 3600/17, which is approximately 211.7647, and to report it as 212.\n\nGiven that, the number of married couples is approximately 212.\n\nBut again, this seems unsatisfactory because you can't have a fraction of a couple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round down to 211 couples.\n\nIn that case:\n\nC = 211\n\nM = (3/2)*211 = 316.5 \u2248 317 men\n\nW = (4/3)*211 \u2248 281.333 \u2248 281 women\n\nThen, M + W = 317 + 281 = 598, which is less than 600.\n\nAlternatively, round M up to 317 and W up to 282:\n\nM + W = 317 + 282 = 599, still less than 600.\n\nAlternatively, round M up to 318 and W down to 282:\n\nM + W = 318 + 282 = 600\n\nThen, C = (2/3)*318 = 212\n\nAnd C = (3/4)*282 = 211.5 \u2248 212\n\nThis is closer, but there's still a discrepancy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by accepting that the number of married couples is approximately 212.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is unsolvable with the given constraints, and there's an error in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach that I'm missing.\n\nGiven all of this, I'm going to conclude that the number of married couples in the town is approximately 212.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{212}
