        "content": "Let's see. If each bag contains 8 apples and I buy 7 bags, I can find out the total number of apples by multiplying the number of bags by the number of apples per bag. So, that would be 7 bags times 8 apples per bag, which equals 56 apples.\n\nNow, if I give away 2 apples to each of my 4 friends, I need to calculate how many apples I'm giving away in total. That would be 2 apples per friend times 4 friends, which equals 8 apples.\n\nTo find out how many apples are left, I subtract the number of apples I gave away from the total number of apples I had initially. So, 56 apples minus 8 apples equals 48 apples.\n\nTherefore, after giving away apples to my friends, I have 48 apples left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
