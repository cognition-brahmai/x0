        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A multinational corporation is setting up a new research and development center and they're planning to hire 1,000 engineers. Each engineer is going to make an average salary of $80,000 per year. On top of that, the company has to pay employee benefits, which are 30% of each employee's salary. I need to calculate the total annual cost for employing these engineers, including both their salaries and their benefits.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total salary cost for all the engineers. Since there are 1,000 engineers and each makes $80,000, I can just multiply the number of engineers by the average salary.\n\nSo, total salaries = number of engineers \u00d7 average salary per engineer\n\nThat would be:\n\nTotal salaries = 1,000 \u00d7 $80,000 = $80,000,000\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total benefits cost. The benefits are 30% of each employee's salary. So, for each engineer, the benefits would be 30% of $80,000.\n\nBenefits per engineer = 30% of $80,000\n\nTo calculate 30% of $80,000, I can multiply $80,000 by 0.30.\n\nBenefits per engineer = $80,000 \u00d7 0.30 = $24,000\n\nSo, each engineer's benefits cost the company $24,000 per year.\n\nNow, since there are 1,000 engineers, the total benefits cost would be:\n\nTotal benefits = number of engineers \u00d7 benefits per engineer\n\nTotal benefits = 1,000 \u00d7 $24,000 = $24,000,000\n\nAlright, so the total benefits cost is $24,000,000.\n\nNow, to find the total annual cost of employing all these engineers, including both salaries and benefits, I need to add the total salaries and the total benefits together.\n\nTotal annual cost = total salaries + total benefits\n\nTotal annual cost = $80,000,000 + $24,000,000 = $104,000,000\n\nSo, the total annual cost is $104,000,000.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the total salaries: 1,000 engineers \u00d7 $80,000 each equals $80,000,000. That seems correct.\n\nNext, benefits are 30% of each salary. 30% of $80,000 is $24,000 per engineer. Multiply that by 1,000 engineers, and that's $24,000,000 for total benefits. That checks out.\n\nAdding the two together: $80,000,000 + $24,000,000 equals $104,000,000. Yep, that's the total annual cost.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it this way: if benefits are 30% of the salary, then the total cost per engineer is the salary plus 30% of the salary, which is the same as 130% of the salary.\n\nSo, total cost per engineer = salary + benefits = $80,000 + $24,000 = $104,000\n\nOr, $80,000 \u00d7 1.30 = $104,000\n\nThen, for 1,000 engineers, total annual cost would be 1,000 \u00d7 $104,000 = $104,000,000\n\nThat's the same result I got earlier, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the total cost is 130% of the total salaries.\n\nTotal cost = total salaries \u00d7 130% = $80,000,000 \u00d7 1.30 = $104,000,000\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I end up with $104,000,000 as the total annual cost for employing the 1,000 engineers, including both salaries and benefits.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. The key here is remembering to include both the salaries and the benefits, and understanding that benefits are an additional 30% of each salary.\n\nIt's also important to make sure that when calculating the total benefits, it's based on each individual's salary, not on the total salaries. But in this case, since the average salary is given and the benefit rate is the same for all, multiplying the average salary by the number of employees gives the total salaries, and similarly, multiplying the benefit per engineer by the number of engineers gives the total benefits.\n\nOverall, the calculation seems straightforward, but it's always good to double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{104000000} \\]"
