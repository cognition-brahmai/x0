        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in the class, and 60% of them passed the exam. First, I need to find out how many students that is. So, 60% of 30 is calculated by multiplying 30 by 0.60.\n\n30 * 0.60 = 18 students passed the exam.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more students need to pass to reach a 75% passing rate. So, I need to find out what 75% of 30 is.\n\n30 * 0.75 = 22.5\n\nBut since we can't have half a student, I'll round up to 23 students needed to pass for a 75% passing rate.\n\nCurrently, 18 students have passed, so to find out how many more need to pass, I subtract 18 from 23.\n\n23 - 18 = 5\n\nSo, 5 more students need to pass to reach a 75% passing rate.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that rounding. 75% of 30 is 22.5, and since we can't have half a student, should I round up to 23 or round down to 22?\n\nIf we round down to 22, then 22 out of 30 is 22/30 = 0.7333, which is 73.33%, which is less than 75%. So, to reach at least 75%, we need to round up to 23 students.\n\nAlternatively, 23 out of 30 is 23/30 = 0.7666, which is 76.66%, which is higher than 75%. So, to reach at least 75%, we need 23 students to pass.\n\nTherefore, the number of additional students needed to pass is 23 - 18 = 5.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
