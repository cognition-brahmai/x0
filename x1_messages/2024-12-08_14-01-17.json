Each plan should be accompanied by an evidence value, which represents the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user question, previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nBingSearch[input]: A tool that enables users to search for information via Bing. Useful for locating potential sources of answers.\nWebReader[input]: This tool reads content from websites. Input should be one or more URLs, separated by commas.\nURLCollector[input]: Collects URLs from a block of text and outputs them as a list.\nKnowledgeProcessor[input]: Answers questions based on a supplied text passage. The input needs to be a textual question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable, such as 'What is the capital city, given :evidence1:?'.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action, based on outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, potentially referring to prior evidence, e.g., 'Given context :evidence0']\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: - contains the final response]\n\nQuestion: Who is the current Prime Minister of Japan and what major policies have they implemented?"
