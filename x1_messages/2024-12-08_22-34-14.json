        "content": "Let's see here. The city is building a sports complex with a soccer field, basketball courts, and a swimming pool, and the total budget is $5 million. The individual construction costs are $2 million for the soccer field, $1.5 million for the basketball courts, and $3 million for the swimming pool. There's an option to apply for a federal grant that covers 50% of one facility's cost. I need to figure out which facility to apply the grant to in order to maximize the use of the budget and then calculate the final costs after applying the grant.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"maximize the use of the budget\" means. I think it means to spend as much of the $5 million as possible without exceeding it. So, I need to choose which facility to apply the grant to in a way that the total spending is as close as possible to $5 million.\n\nLet's list out the costs without any grant:\n\n- Soccer field: $2 million\n\n- Basketball courts: $1.5 million\n\n- Swimming pool: $3 million\n\nTotal without grant: $2 million + $1.5 million + $3 million = $6.5 million\n\nBut the budget is only $5 million, so without a grant, they can't afford all three facilities.\n\nNow, the grant covers 50% of one facility's cost. So, depending on which facility gets the grant, the city will pay only 50% of that facility's cost.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. Applying the grant to the soccer field:\n\n- Grant covers 50% of $2 million = $1 million\n\n- City pays $1 million for the soccer field\n\n- Total cost: $1 million (soccer) + $1.5 million (basketball) + $3 million (swimming) = $5.5 million\n\n- But the budget is only $5 million, so this still exceeds the budget by $0.5 million.\n\n2. Applying the grant to the basketball courts:\n\n- Grant covers 50% of $1.5 million = $0.75 million\n\n- City pays $0.75 million for the basketball courts\n\n- Total cost: $2 million (soccer) + $0.75 million (basketball) + $3 million (swimming) = $5.75 million\n\n- This exceeds the budget by $0.75 million.\n\n3. Applying the grant to the swimming pool:\n\n- Grant covers 50% of $3 million = $1.5 million\n\n- City pays $1.5 million for the swimming pool\n\n- Total cost: $2 million (soccer) + $1.5 million (basketball) + $1.5 million (swimming) = $5 million\n\n- This exactly matches the budget.\n\nSo, by applying the grant to the swimming pool, the total cost is exactly $5 million, which is perfect and makes full use of the budget without exceeding it.\n\nLet me double-check if there's a way to get closer to $5 million with another combination.\n\nIf I choose to apply the grant to the soccer field, the total is $5.5 million, which is $0.5 million over budget.\n\nIf I choose the basketball courts, it's $5.75 million, which is $0.75 million over.\n\nApplying the grant to the swimming pool hits the budget exactly.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to apply the grant to the swimming pool.\n\nNow, to calculate the final cost for each facility after applying the grant:\n\n- Soccer field: $2 million (no grant)\n\n- Basketball courts: $1.5 million (no grant)\n\n- Swimming pool: $3 million - $1.5 million grant = $1.5 million\n\nTotal: $2 million + $1.5 million + $1.5 million = $5 million\n\nThis seems straightforward. But maybe I should consider if there's a way to get additional grant coverage or if there's another way to optimize the spending.\n\nWait a minute, the grant covers 50% of one facility's cost. Is there any option to apply for multiple grants or partial grants for different facilities? The problem says \"the federal grant that will cover 50% of the cost of one facility.\" So, only one facility can receive the grant.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to choose one facility to receive the 50% grant.\n\nGiven that, applying it to the swimming pool is the best choice because it allows the city to build all three facilities within the budget.\n\nAlternatively, if the grant is applied to the soccer field, the city would have to pay $1 million for soccer, $1.5 million for basketball, and $3 million for swimming, totaling $5.5 million, which is over budget. They would need to find additional funds or reduce costs.\n\nSimilarly, applying it to basketball courts would require paying $2 million for soccer, $0.75 million for basketball, and $3 million for swimming, totaling $5.75 million, which is further over budget.\n\nTherefore, applying the grant to the swimming pool is the only option that allows the city to build all three facilities within the budget.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to maximize the use of the budget. Since applying the grant to the swimming pool allows the city to spend the entire $5 million without exceeding it, and building all three facilities, it seems to be the optimal choice.\n\nI don't think there's a better option given the constraints.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Apply the grant to the swimming pool. Final costs: Soccer field: } \\$2,000,000; \\text{ Basketball courts: } \\$1,500,000; \\text{ Swimming pool: } \\$1,500,000} \\]"
