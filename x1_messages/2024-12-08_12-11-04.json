        "content": "Let's see. There are 36 students in total, and the ratio of boys to girls is 4:5. I need to find out how many boys and girls there are.\n\nFirst, I understand that a ratio tells us about the proportion of one quantity to another. So, in this case, for every 4 boys, there are 5 girls.\n\nTo find the actual numbers, I can think of the ratio as parts. So, boys are 4 parts and girls are 5 parts, making a total of 4 + 5 = 9 parts.\n\nNow, these 9 parts represent the total number of students, which is 36.\n\nSo, to find the value of one part, I can divide the total number of students by the total number of parts:\n\nOne part = 36 \u00f7 9 = 4 students.\n\nNow, since boys are 4 parts, the number of boys is 4 parts \u00d7 4 students per part = 16 boys.\n\nSimilarly, girls are 5 parts, so the number of girls is 5 parts \u00d7 4 students per part = 20 girls.\n\nLet me check if this adds up: 16 boys + 20 girls = 36 students. Yes, that matches the total.\n\nAlso, checking the ratio: 16:20 simplifies to 4:5, which matches the given ratio.\n\nSo, there are 16 boys and 20 girls in the class.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16 \\text{ boys and } 20 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
