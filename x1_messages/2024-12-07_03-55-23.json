        "content": "So there are 6 lions and 18 zebras in the zoo. I need to find the ratio of lions to zebras. A ratio compares two quantities by division, right? So, to find the ratio of lions to zebras, I should divide the number of lions by the number of zebras.\n\nWait, but I think ratios can also be expressed in the form of a:b, where a and b are the quantities being compared. So, in this case, it would be 6:18. But can this be simplified?\n\nYes, just like fractions, ratios can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 6 and 18 is 6. So, dividing both numbers by 6, I get 1:3.\n\nSo, the ratio of lions to zebras is 1:3. That means for every 1 lion, there are 3 zebras.\n\nAlternatively, I could express this ratio in decimal form by dividing 6 by 18, which equals 0.333..., or approximately 0.33. But I think the fractional form 1:3 is more straightforward and precise.\n\nWait, but ratios can also be expressed as a fraction. So, 1:3 is the same as 1/3. That makes sense because there is one lion for every three zebras.\n\nI should also consider if the ratio is being asked in terms of lions per zebra or zebras per lion. The question says \"the ratio of lions to zebras,\" so it's lions compared to zebras, which is 1:3.\n\nBut just to double-check, if someone says \"the ratio of A to B,\" it means A divided by B, or A:B. So, in this case, A is lions (6) and B is zebras (18), so 6:18, which simplifies to 1:3.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the ratio of lions to zebras is 1:3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1:3} \\]"
