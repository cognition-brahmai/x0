        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 100 people in a group, and among them, 70 have read book A, 50 have read book B, and 20 have read both books. I need to find out how many people have read neither book. Hmm, this sounds like a classic problem in set theory, specifically dealing with unions and intersections of sets.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. I think a Venn diagram would be helpful here. I can draw two circles overlapping each other: one for book A and one for book B.\n\nSo, the number of people who have read book A is 70, and book B is 50, but 20 have read both. That means the overlap between the two circles is 20 people.\n\nTo find out how many people have read at least one of the books, I need to find the union of sets A and B, which is denoted by A \u222a B.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |A| is the number of people who have read book A (70)\n\n- |B| is the number of people who have read book B (50)\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of people who have read both books (20)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|A \u222a B| = 70 + 50 - 20 = 100\n\nSo, 100 people have read at least one of the books.\n\nBut wait, there are only 100 people in the group. Does that mean everyone has read at least one book, and therefore, zero people have read neither?\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nIf |A \u222a B| = 100, and the total number of people is 100, then the number of people who have read neither book should be:\n\nTotal people - |A \u222a B| = 100 - 100 = 0\n\nBut, I'm a bit suspicious because the numbers added up too neatly. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion again to make sure I'm applying it correctly.\n\nInclusion-exclusion principle states that to find the total number of elements in the union of two sets, you add the sizes of the individual sets and then subtract the size of their intersection to correct for double-counting.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nPeople who have read book A or book B = People who have read book A + People who have read book B - People who have read both\n\nWhich is:\n\n70 + 50 - 20 = 100\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, to find the number of people who have read neither book, I subtract the number who have read at least one book from the total number of people:\n\n100 - 100 = 0\n\nSo, according to this, no one has read neither book.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any overlap or miscounting.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the number of people who have read only book A, only book B, and both.\n\n- Only book A: |A| - |A \u2229 B| = 70 - 20 = 50\n\n- Only book B: |B| - |A \u2229 B| = 50 - 20 = 30\n\n- Both books: 20\n\nSo, total people who have read at least one book: 50 (only A) + 30 (only B) + 20 (both) = 100\n\nAgain, this matches the total number of people in the group.\n\nTherefore, indeed, zero people have read neither book.\n\nWait a minute, is there any possibility that some people might not be accounted for? For example, could some people have read neither book but been included in the counts for book A or B by mistake?\n\nLooking back at the problem, it seems clearly stated: 70 have read book A, 50 have read book B, and 20 have read both.\n\nAssuming that these numbers are accurate and that there are no errors in reporting, then the calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the given numbers. For instance, if more people have read both books than the number who have read book B, that would indicate an error.\n\nBut in this case, 20 have read both, which is less than both 70 and 50, so that's consistent.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps some people have read more than two books, but since only two books are mentioned, that shouldn't affect the calculation for having read at least one of book A or book B.\n\nTherefore, I stick with the initial conclusion that zero people have read neither book.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
