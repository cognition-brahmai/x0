People have different tastes and preferences when it comes to literature, and what one person considers the best book may not be the same for another person. Additionally, literature is often subjective, and what one person finds meaningful or impactful may not resonate with someone else. Therefore, it's impossible to pinpoint a single book that is considered the best by everyone."
