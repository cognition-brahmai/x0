        "content": "So, there are 24 students in total in the classroom. Out of these, 12 play soccer, 8 play basketball, and 4 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I've seen similar problems where we have to find the number of people who don't belong to any group.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to find those who don't play either sport.\n\nSo, 12 students play soccer and 8 play basketball, but 4 play both. If I just add 12 and 8, that would be 20, but that counts the students who play both sports twice\u2014once in soccer and once in basketball. So, to avoid double-counting, I need to subtract the number of students who play both sports.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play at least one sport is 12 + 8 - 4 = 16.\n\nNow, total students are 24, so the number of students who don't play either sport is 24 - 16 = 8.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 12 play soccer and 8 play basketball, and 4 play both, then the number who play only soccer is 12 - 4 = 8, and only basketball is 8 - 4 = 4.\n\nSo, only soccer: 8 students, only basketball: 4 students, and both: 4 students. That totals to 8 + 4 + 4 = 16 students who play at least one sport.\n\nThen, 24 - 16 = 8 students who don't play either sport.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula for two sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |A| is the number of students who play soccer (12),\n\n- |B| is the number of students who play basketball (8),\n\n- |A \u2229 B| is the number of students who play both (4).\n\nSo, |A \u222a B| = 12 + 8 - 4 = 16.\n\nThen, the number of students who don't play either sport is the total number of students minus those who play at least one sport: 24 - 16 = 8.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think 8 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
