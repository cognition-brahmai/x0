        "content": "In microeconomics, elasticity refers to the responsiveness or sensitivity of one economic variable to a change in another economic variable. It is a key concept that helps in understanding how different factors influence consumer behavior, producer decisions, and market outcomes.\n\nOption A: \"It is a measure of a variable's sensitivity to a change in another variable.\" This is the correct definition of elasticity in economics. Elasticity is used to quantify how much one economic variable, such as quantity demanded or supplied, responds to a change in another variable, such as price or income.\n\nOption B: \"It is the state of equilibrium where supply equals demand.\" This describes market equilibrium, not elasticity. In equilibrium, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at a particular price, but elasticity measures how responsive the quantities are to changes in price or other factors.\n\nOption C: \"It is the additional satisfaction a consumer gets from purchasing one more unit of a product.\" This describes marginal utility, which is the extra satisfaction gained from consuming one additional unit of a good or service. While elasticity can relate to changes in utility, it is not the same concept.\n\nOption D: \"It is the cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered.\" This refers to sunk cost, which is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered, regardless of future actions. Sunk costs are important in decision-making, but they are distinct from elasticity.\n\nOption E: \"None of the above.\" This would only be correct if none of the preceding options accurately describe elasticity, but since option A correctly defines it, this is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. Elasticity is indeed a measure of a variable's sensitivity to a change in another variable. In economics, common types of elasticity include price elasticity of demand, income elasticity of demand, and cross-price elasticity of demand, each measuring different aspects of responsiveness in consumer behavior.\n\n**Further Explanation:**\n\n- **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):** Measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\n- **Income Elasticity of Demand (YED):** Measures how the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumers' income. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.\n\n- **Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (XED):** Measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good. It helps determine whether two goods are substitutes or complements.\n\nUnderstanding elasticity is crucial for businesses and policymakers as it helps them predict how changes in prices, income, or other variables will affect demand and supply, thereby informing decisions on pricing, production, and resource allocation."
