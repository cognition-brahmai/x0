        "content": "To calculate the total revenue for the month, we need to find out how much money the company made from selling both Product A and Product B. We'll do this by multiplying the number of units sold by the price per unit for each product and then adding those amounts together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from Product A:\n\nNumber of units sold: 350\n\nPrice per unit: $25\n\nRevenue from Product A = 350 units * $25/unit\n\nNow, let's calculate the revenue from Product B:\n\nNumber of units sold: 500\n\nPrice per unit: $40\n\nRevenue from Product B = 500 units * $40/unit\n\nFinally, we'll add the revenue from both products to get the total revenue.\n\nLet me do the math step by step.\n\nStarting with Product A:\n\n350 units * $25/unit = ?\n\nWell, 300 units * $25 = $7,500\n\nAnd 50 units * $25 = $1,250\n\nSo, $7,500 + $1,250 = $8,750\n\nThat's the revenue from Product A.\n\nNow, Product B:\n\n500 units * $40/unit = ?\n\n500 units * $40 = $20,000\n\nEasy enough.\n\nNow, total revenue is the sum of both:\n\n$8,750 (from A) + $20,000 (from B) = $28,750\n\nSo, the total revenue for the month is $28,750.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, Product A: 350 units * $25 each.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n350 * 25\n\nI can break it down further:\n\n350 * 20 = 7,000\n\n350 * 5 = 1,750\n\nAdding those together: 7,000 + 1,750 = 8,750\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, Product B: 500 * 40 = 20,000\n\nAdding both: 8,750 + 20,000 = 28,750\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be thorough, I can calculate the total revenue using a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total number of units sold and their respective prices.\n\nTotal revenue = (units of A * price of A) + (units of B * price of B)\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as:\n\nTotal revenue = (350 * 25) + (500 * 40)\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n350 * 25:\n\n300 * 25 = 7,500\n\n50 * 25 = 1,250\n\nTotal for A: 7,500 + 1,250 = 8,750\n\n500 * 40:\n\nThat's straightforward, 500 * 40 = 20,000\n\nAdding them up: 8,750 + 20,000 = 28,750\n\nYes, consistent result.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the revenue from each product separately and then sum them up, which is essentially what I did.\n\nI think $28,750 is the correct total revenue for the month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28750} \\]"
