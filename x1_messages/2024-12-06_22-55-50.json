        "content": "So I have this problem here: there's a square with sides that are 10 inches long, and I need to find the area of a circle that's inscribed in this square. Okay, first things first, I need to visualize this. So, a square with sides of 10 inches, and a circle drawn inside it, touching all four sides. Got it.\n\nNow, to find the area of a circle, I know the formula is \u03c0 times the radius squared, right? So, area = \u03c0r\u00b2. So, I need to find the radius of this circle.\n\nSince the circle is inscribed in the square, that means it touches the square at exactly one point on each side. So, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the side length of the square. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me think. If the circle is touching all four sides, then the diameter should be equal to the side length of the square. Because the diameter is the biggest distance across the circle, and it should match the side of the square.\n\nSo, if the side of the square is 10 inches, then the diameter of the circle is also 10 inches. Therefore, the radius, which is half of the diameter, would be 5 inches.\n\nSo, radius = diameter / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 inches.\n\nNow, plug that into the area formula: area = \u03c0 * (5)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 25.\n\nI think that's it. So, the area of the circle is 25\u03c0 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using the diagonal of the square or something. But no, since the circle is inscribed, it's touching the sides, not related to the diagonal.\n\nLet me double-check. The circle is inscribed in the square, meaning it's tangent to all four sides. So, yes, the diameter equals the side length of the square.\n\nAlternatively, if the circle was circumscribed around the square, then the diameter would be equal to the diagonal of the square. But in this case, it's inscribed, so diameter equals side length.\n\nSo, my answer should be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's calculate the area numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 25 times that is about 78.54 square inches. But since the problem didn't specify to use a decimal approximation, leaving it as 25\u03c0 is probably best.\n\nIs there any other aspect to consider here? Maybe the area of the square minus the area of the circle, but the question only asks for the area of the circle.\n\nSo, I think 25\u03c0 square inches is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\pi} \\]"
