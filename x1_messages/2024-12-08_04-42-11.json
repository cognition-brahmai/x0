        "content": "First, I need to find the area of the garden in square feet and then convert that to square yards.\n\nThe garden is rectangular, so the area in square feet is length times width. The length is 40 feet and the width is 30 feet.\n\nArea in square feet = 40 feet * 30 feet = 1200 square feet.\n\nNow, I need to convert square feet to square yards. I know that 1 yard = 3 feet, so 1 square yard = 3 feet * 3 feet = 9 square feet.\n\nTherefore, to convert from square feet to square yards, I divide the area in square feet by 9.\n\nArea in square yards = 1200 square feet / 9 square feet per square yard = 133.333... square yards.\n\nBut I should check if this is correct. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the dimensions from feet to yards before multiplying.\n\nSince 1 yard = 3 feet, then:\n\nLength in yards = 40 feet / 3 = 13.333... yards.\n\nWidth in yards = 30 feet / 3 = 10 yards.\n\nNow, area in square yards = length in yards * width in yards = 13.333... yards * 10 yards = 133.333... square yards.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so that's good.\n\nWait, but in the first method, I divided by 9, and in the second, I converted each dimension separately. It seems both methods give the same result, which makes sense because (length in feet * width in feet) / 9 = (length in feet / 3) * (width in feet / 3) = length in yards * width in yards.\n\nSo, the area of the garden is approximately 133.33 square yards.\n\nBut should I leave it as a decimal or convert it to a fraction?\n\n133.333... is the same as 133 and 1/3.\n\nSo, the area is 133 1/3 square yards.\n\nAlternatively, if more precision is needed, I could express it as a decimal with more places, like 133.333 square yards, but since it's a repeating decimal, 133.33 is acceptable for most purposes.\n\nI think 133.33 square yards is fine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{133.\\overline{3}} \\]"
