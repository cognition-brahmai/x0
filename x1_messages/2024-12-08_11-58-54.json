        "content": "So the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system. They currently have 100 buses, each carrying 50 passengers. They want to increase the total passenger capacity by 25% and keep an average occupancy rate of 80%. Also, they need to figure out how many new routes to add, with each route having at least two buses.\n\nFirst, let's understand what they're asking. They want to increase the total passenger capacity by 25%. So, capacity means how many people can the buses carry in total. Currently, they have 100 buses, each carrying 50 passengers, so the total capacity is 100 * 50 = 5000 passengers.\n\nIncreasing that by 25% means they want to add 25% more capacity. So, 25% of 5000 is 0.25 * 5000 = 1250 passengers. Therefore, the new total capacity should be 5000 + 1250 = 6250 passengers.\n\nNow, each bus still carries 50 passengers, so to find out how many buses they need in total to reach 6250 passengers, we divide 6250 by 50. That's 6250 / 50 = 125 buses.\n\nThey already have 100 buses, so they need 125 - 100 = 25 additional buses.\n\nNext, they need to estimate the number of new routes required. Each route must have at least two buses operating simultaneously.\n\nSo, with 25 new buses, and each route needing at least two buses, the number of new routes would be the number of pairs of buses.\n\nTo find out how many pairs we can make from 25 buses, we divide 25 by 2.\n\n25 divided by 2 is 12.5.\n\nBut we can't have half a route, so they would need 13 new routes, with one route having only one bus, which contradicts the requirement of at least two buses per route.\n\nWait, but the problem says each route must have at least two buses. So, if they have 25 new buses, and each route needs two buses, then they can have 12 full routes with 2 buses each, using up 24 buses, and have 1 bus left over.\n\nBut they can't operate a route with just one bus; it needs at least two. So, what to do with that extra bus?\n\nMaybe they can add it to one of the existing routes, making it have three buses instead of two.\n\nSo, in that case, they would have 12 new routes with two buses each, and one route with three buses, using all 25 buses.\n\nAlternatively, they could consider not using that extra bus for new routes, but perhaps retain it for backup or other purposes.\n\nBut the question is to estimate the number of new routes required, considering each route has at least two buses.\n\nSo, with 25 buses, and each route requiring two buses, they can have 12 full routes and have one bus left, which can't operate a new route on its own.\n\nTherefore, they would need 12 new routes.\n\nBut wait, that uses only 24 buses. So, there's one bus leftover.\n\nPerhaps they need to plan for 13 routes, each with at least two buses, but that would require 26 buses, which is more than the 25 they have.\n\nAlternatively, they could have 12 routes with two buses each and one route with three buses, using all 25 buses.\n\nIn that case, they would have 13 new routes.\n\nBut the problem says \"each route will have at least two buses operating simultaneously.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify that all routes must have exactly two buses; some can have more.\n\nSo, having 13 routes, with 12 having two buses and one having three, satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, they would need 13 new routes.\n\nWait, but that uses 25 buses: 12 routes * 2 buses = 24 buses, plus one route with 3 buses = 27 buses, which is more than they have.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. If they have 12 routes with two buses each, that's 24 buses, and one route with three buses, that's 27 buses in total, but they only have 25 buses.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThey have 25 new buses.\n\nEach new route must have at least two buses.\n\nSo, the number of new routes can't exceed the total number of buses divided by two.\n\n25 divided by 2 is 12.5.\n\nSince they can't have half a route, they need to round down to 12 routes, using 24 buses, and have one bus left over.\n\nBut what to do with that one extra bus?\n\nThey can't operate a new route with just one bus.\n\nSo, perhaps they need to plan for 12 new routes, using 24 buses, and keep the extra bus for other purposes, like maintenance backup.\n\nAlternatively, they could consider adding that extra bus to one of the 12 routes, making it a route with three buses.\n\nIn that case, they would still have 12 routes, but one of them has three buses instead of two.\n\nBut the problem specifies that each route has at least two buses operating simultaneously, which would still be satisfied.\n\nSo, in this scenario, they would have 12 new routes, with one route having three buses and the others having two each.\n\nAlternatively, if they insist on all new routes having exactly two buses each, then they can only have 12 new routes, using 24 buses, and have one bus left over.\n\nIn that case, they might need to consider either not using that extra bus for new routes or finding another way to utilize it.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, the focus is on estimating the number of new routes required, given the constraint of at least two buses per route.\n\nTherefore, with 25 new buses and each route requiring two buses, they can operate 12 new routes with two buses each and have one bus left over.\n\nAlternatively, they could operate 12 routes with two buses and one route with three buses, totaling 13 routes.\n\nBut that would require 27 buses, which is more than the 25 they have.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, 12 routes with two buses is 24 buses, plus one route with three buses is 27 buses, which exceeds the 25 available.\n\nSo, that's not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to have 12 new routes with two buses each, using 24 buses, and have one bus left over.\n\nThey can't operate a 13th route with just one bus, as it doesn't meet the requirement of at least two buses per route.\n\nTherefore, they need to plan for 12 new routes.\n\nAs for the extra bus, they might need to consider using it for additional service on certain routes during peak times or keeping it as a backup for maintenance purposes.\n\nBut in terms of the number of new routes required, it's 12.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about having 13 routes, with one having three buses, but that would require 27 buses, which is more than they have.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they could have some routes with more than two buses.\n\nBut the problem only specifies that each route must have at least two buses, not exactly two.\n\nSo, they could have routes with more than two buses if they choose to.\n\nBut with 25 buses, and 12 routes requiring 24 buses, they have one bus left.\n\nThey could assign that extra bus to one of the 12 routes, making it a route with three buses.\n\nIn that case, they would have 13 routes in total: 11 with two buses and one with three buses, using 25 buses in total.\n\nWait, no. If they have 12 routes, and assign the extra bus to one of them, making it three buses, then it's still 12 routes, not 13.\n\nI think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently.\n\nLet R be the number of new routes.\n\nEach route requires at least two buses.\n\nTherefore, the total number of buses required is at least 2R.\n\nBut they have 25 new buses.\n\nSo, 2R \u2264 25.\n\nTherefore, R \u2264 12.5.\n\nSince the number of routes must be an integer, R \u2264 12.\n\nTherefore, they can have up to 12 new routes, using 24 buses, and have one bus left over.\n\nAlternatively, if they want all routes to have at least two buses, and use all 25 buses, they would need to have 12 routes with two buses (24 buses) and one route with one bus, but that violates the requirement of at least two buses per route.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of new routes they can have is 12, using 24 buses, and have one bus left over.\n\nAlternatively, if they are allowed to have routes with more than two buses, they could assign the extra bus to one of the 12 routes, making it have three buses.\n\nIn this case, they still have 12 routes, but one of them has three buses.\n\nThis way, all routes have at least two buses, and all 25 buses are used.\n\nTherefore, the number of new routes required is 12.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about 13 routes, but that doesn't work because it would require 26 buses, which is more than they have.\n\nSo, 12 is the maximum number of new routes they can have with 25 buses, each route having at least two buses.\n\nTherefore, the city needs to add 25 buses and 12 new routes.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculations.\n\nCurrent fleet: 100 buses, each with 50 passengers.\n\nTotal current capacity: 100 * 50 = 5000 passengers.\n\nDesired increase: 25% of 5000 = 0.25 * 5000 = 1250 passengers.\n\nNew total capacity: 5000 + 1250 = 6250 passengers.\n\nNumber of buses needed: 6250 / 50 = 125 buses.\n\nAdditional buses needed: 125 - 100 = 25 buses.\n\nNumber of new routes: with each route requiring at least two buses.\n\nWith 25 buses, maximum number of routes is 25 / 2 = 12.5.\n\nSince they can't have half a route, they can have 12 routes, using 24 buses, and have one bus left over.\n\nAlternatively, have 12 routes with two buses and one route with three buses, totaling 13 routes, but that would require 27 buses, which is more than they have.\n\nTherefore, the feasible number of new routes is 12.\n\nSo, the city needs to add 25 buses and 12 new routes.\n\nBut wait, in the alternative scenario where they have 12 routes, each with at least two buses, and one route has three buses, using 25 buses in total.\n\nWait, how does that work?\n\n12 routes with two buses: 12 * 2 = 24 buses.\n\nPlus one route with three buses: 3 buses.\n\nTotal buses: 24 + 3 = 27 buses.\n\nBut they only have 25 buses.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, they can't have 13 routes with at least two buses each using only 25 buses.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible option is to have 12 new routes, each with two buses (24 buses), and have one bus left over.\n\nThey can't operate a 13th route with just one bus.\n\nTherefore, the city needs to add 25 buses and 12 new routes.\n\nAs for the leftover bus, they might need to consider other uses, such as peak hour support or backup for maintenance.\n\nBut in terms of the number of new routes required, it's 12.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25 \\text{ buses and } 12 \\text{ routes}} \\]"
