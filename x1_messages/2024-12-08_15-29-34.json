        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of products: Product A costs $10 and Product B costs $15. The store sold a total of 200 items and made $2,600 in sales in one week. We need to find out how many units of each product were sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of units of Product A sold.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of units of Product B sold.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of items sold is 200.\n\n2. The total sales amount is $2,600.\n\nSo, we can translate these into equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 200 \\)  (total items)\n\n2. \\( 10x + 15y = 2600 \\)  (total sales)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination method. I'll use the substitution method for this example.\n\nFirst, solve equation 1 for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 200 - y \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into equation 2:\n\n\\( 10(200 - y) + 15y = 2600 \\)\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 2000 - 10y + 15y = 2600 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 2000 + 5y = 2600 \\)\n\nSubtract 2000 from both sides:\n\n\\( 5y = 600 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\( y = 120 \\)\n\nSo, 120 units of Product B were sold.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 200 - 120 = 80 \\)\n\nTherefore, 80 units of Product A were sold.\n\nTo double-check, let's verify these amounts with the total sales:\n\n\\( 10 \\times 80 + 15 \\times 120 = 800 + 1800 = 2600 \\)\n\nYes, that matches the total sales given in the problem.\n\nSo, the store sold 80 units of Product A and 120 units of Product B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80 \\text{ units of Product A and } 120 \\text{ units of Product B}} \\]"
