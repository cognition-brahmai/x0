        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we have a group of 50 people, and 20% of them have blue eyes. So, I need to find out how many people have blue eyes initially.\n\nTo find 20% of 50, I can calculate it as follows:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 50 = 10\n\\]\nSo, there are 10 people with blue eyes in the group initially.\n\nThe rest of the people have brown eyes. To find out how many have brown eyes, I can subtract the number of blue-eyed people from the total number of people:\n\\[\n50 - 10 = 40\n\\]\nSo, there are 40 people with brown eyes.\n\nNow, 5 more people with blue eyes join the group. So, the number of blue-eyed people increases by 5:\n\\[\n10 + 5 = 15\n\\]\nThe total number of people in the group now becomes:\n\\[\n50 + 5 = 55\n\\]\nI need to find out what percentage of the group now has blue eyes. To find the percentage, I can use the formula:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\text{number of blue-eyed people}}{\\text{total number of people}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{15}{55} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nFirst, I'll divide 15 by 55:\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{55} \\approx 0.2727\n\\]\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.2727 \\times 100 \\approx 27.27\\%\n\\]\nSo, approximately 27.27% of the group will have blue eyes after the 5 additional blue-eyed people join.\n\nAlternatively, I can simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{15}{55}\\) before multiplying by 100. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 5:\n\\[\n\\frac{15 \\div 5}{55 \\div 5} = \\frac{3}{11}\n\\]\nNow, divide 3 by 11:\n\\[\n3 \\div 11 \\approx 0.2727\n\\]\nThen, multiply by 100:\n\\[\n0.2727 \\times 100 \\approx 27.27\\%\n\\]\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 27.27%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27.27\\%} \\]"
