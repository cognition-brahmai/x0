        "content": "You're referring to \"Knight Rider,\" a popular American television series that first aired in the late 1980s. In the show, David Hasselhoff played Michael Knight, a former stunt driver turned crime-fighter. He was assisted by KITT, a highly advanced, artificially intelligent automobile equipped with various gadgets and weaponry.\n\nKITT was more than just a car; it was a sophisticated computer system integrated into a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. The vehicle could engage in conversation with Michael, provide strategic advice, and even operate autonomously in certain situations. The series explored themes of technology, crimefighting, and the relationship between man and machine.\n\n\"Knight Rider\" was known for its high-tech concepts, action-packed sequences, and the iconic tagline: \"Wherever you go, whatever you do, Knight Rider is always watching.\" The show was a hit during its original run and has since become a cult classic, influencing numerous other media properties that feature intelligent vehicles or AI assistants.\n\nIn addition to the original series, there have been several remakes and adaptations, including a 2008 version that also starred Gabriel Macht as Michael Knight and an AI-enhanced Ford Mustang as KITT. The enduring popularity of \"Knight Rider\" can be attributed to its blend of exciting storytelling, futuristic technology, and the charismatic performances of its leads.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need more information about \"Knight Rider\" or any other topic, feel free to ask!"
