        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the family drinks 2 gallons of milk each week. We need to find out how much they drink in a year.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many weeks there are in a year. I remember that there are 52 weeks in a year. So, if they drink 2 gallons every week, I can multiply the number of weeks by the gallons per week to find the total for the year.\n\nSo, that would be 2 gallons/week times 52 weeks/year. Let me do the math: 2 times 52 is 104. So, they drink 104 gallons in a year.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. Maybe I should consider that some years have 52 weeks and others have 53 weeks. But usually, a year is considered to have 52 weeks. Or maybe I should calculate it based on days.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to know how many days are in a year and how much they drink per day. But wait, the problem gives weekly consumption, not daily. So, sticking with weeks might be simpler.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the number of months in a year and calculate monthly consumption. There are 12 months in a year. If I knew their monthly milk consumption, I could multiply by 12.\n\nBut I don't have monthly consumption directly. I have weekly. So, maybe I should find out how much they drink in a month based on weeks. Typically, a month has about 4 weeks. So, 4 weeks/month times 2 gallons/week is 8 gallons/month.\n\nThen, 8 gallons/month times 12 months/year would be 96 gallons/year.\n\nHmm, that's different from the earlier calculation of 104 gallons. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Using weeks directly gives me 104 gallons, but using months gives me 96 gallons. That doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in one of these approaches.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. A year has 52 weeks, that's straightforward. But when I consider months, averaging 4 weeks per month, 4 weeks times 12 months is 48 weeks, which is less than 52 weeks. So, that's probably why there's a difference.\n\nSo, if I calculate based on months, I need to account for the extra weeks. 52 weeks minus 48 weeks is 4 extra weeks. So, if I calculate 8 gallons per month for 12 months, that's 96 gallons, plus the consumption for the additional 4 weeks, which would be 4 weeks times 2 gallons/week, which is 8 gallons. So, 96 plus 8 is 104 gallons.\n\nAh, now both methods give me the same answer: 104 gallons per year.\n\nSo, the family drinks 104 gallons of milk in a year.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider leap years or other variations. A standard year has 52 weeks and 1 day, while a leap year has 52 weeks and 2 days. But since we're dealing with weekly consumption, and the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's acceptable to use 52 weeks for the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate based on the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a non-leap year. If they drink 2 gallons per week, that's 2 gallons per 7 days. So, their daily consumption is 2/7 gallons per day.\n\nThen, for 365 days, the total consumption would be (2/7) gallons/day times 365 days, which is (2*365)/7 gallons.\n\nLet me calculate that: 2*365 is 730, divided by 7 is approximately 104.2857 gallons.\n\nThat's very close to the earlier calculation of 104 gallons, with a slight difference due to rounding.\n\nIn a leap year with 366 days, it would be (2*366)/7, which is 732/7, approximately 104.5714 gallons.\n\nSo, depending on whether it's a leap year or not, the consumption would be slightly different, but for general purposes, 104 gallons is a reasonable estimate.\n\nTherefore, the family drinks approximately 104 gallons of milk in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{104} \\]"
