        "content": "So there are 12 apples in total in the basket. Out of these, 8 are green, which means the remaining apples are red. To find out how many are red, I can subtract the number of green apples from the total number of apples. So, 12 minus 8 equals 4. So, there are 4 red apples.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a red apple randomly would be the number of red apples divided by the total number of apples. So, that's 4 red apples divided by 12 total apples. To simplify that fraction, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives me 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/3, or approximately 0.333, which is about 33.3%. But since the question didn't specify to give it as a percentage, I'll stick with the fraction 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Probability is indeed calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the favorable outcome is picking a red apple, and there are 4 red apples. Total apples are 12. So, 4/12 simplifies to 1/3. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is, since 8 out of 12 apples are green, that's 8/12 or 2/3 probability of picking a green apple. So, the probability of not picking a green apple (which would be picking a red one) is 1 minus 2/3, which is 1/3. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red apple is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
