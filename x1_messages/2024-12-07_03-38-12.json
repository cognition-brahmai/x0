Media outlets, including newspapers, television, and social media platforms, have a significant influence on public opinion.

Here's why:\n\nMedia Studies focuses on how information is disseminated and interpreted through various media outlets such as newspapers, television, and social media platforms. These outlets play a significant role in shaping public opinion by presenting information, news, and perspectives to a wide audience. Fake news, being misinformation or manipulated content presented as genuine news, primarily spreads through these media channels. Therefore, understanding how fake news affects public opinion would involve analyzing its production, distribution, and consumption through media studies.\n\nInterpersonal Communication, while important, deals more with the exchange of information between individuals and its impact on relationships. While fake news can certainly be shared and discussed interpersonal, the primary mode of its spread is through media outlets. Public Speaking is a subset of interpersonal communication, focusing on delivering information to an audience in a structured manner, but it doesn't directly address the mass dissemination of information that characterizes fake news. Non-Verbal Communication, which deals with the transmission of messages without words, such as through body language or symbols, isn't directly relevant to the study of fake news in this context.\n\nTherefore, Media Studies is the most appropriate choice for studying the impact of fake news on public opinion."
