        "content": "Alright, I have this task to create a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with sum, average, minimum, maximum, and median. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure it handles different array lengths and number ranges properly. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the array. That should be easy; I can use the reduce method to add up all the numbers.\n\nNext, the average can be calculated by dividing the sum by the length of the array. But I have to be careful with empty arrays to avoid division by zero.\n\nFor the minimum and maximum values, JavaScript has Math.min and Math.max functions, but they don't directly accept arrays. I can use spread operators to pass the array elements to these functions.\n\nNow, the median is a bit trickier. The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. So, I need to sort the array first and then find the middle values accordingly.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this function. I should probably start by checking if the array is empty, and maybe return null or a specific message for that case. But since the task says it should handle arrays of different lengths, including possibly empty ones, I need to decide how to handle that.\n\nMaybe I'll return an object with all properties set to null if the array is empty. That way, it's clear that there are no values to compute.\n\nOkay, let's sketch a rough outline:\n\n```javascript\nfunction arrayStats(arr) {\n  if (arr.length === 0) {\n    return {\n      sum: null,\n      average: null,\n      minimum: null,\n      maximum: null,\n      median: null\n    };\n  }\n\n  const sum = arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);\n  const average = sum / arr.length;\n  const minimum = Math.min(...arr);\n  const maximum = Math.max(...arr);\n\n  // Need to sort the array for median\n  const sortedArr = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const mid = Math.floor(sortedArr.length / 2);\n\n  let median;\n  if (sortedArr.length % 2 === 0) {\n    median = (sortedArr[mid - 1] + sortedArr[mid]) / 2;\n  } else {\n    median = sortedArr[mid];\n  }\n\n  return {\n    sum: sum,\n    average: average,\n    minimum: minimum,\n    maximum: maximum,\n    median: median\n  };\n}\n```\n\nWait a minute, I should consider if the array contains non-number elements. Should I add checks to ensure all elements are numbers? The task says \"array of numbers,\" but it's always good to be cautious.\n\nMaybe I can add a check to filter out non-number elements or throw an error. But to keep it simple, I'll assume all elements are numbers.\n\nAlso, for the median, I need to make sure that the array is sorted correctly. I'm using the sort method with a comparator function to ensure numerical sorting, which is important because otherwise, sort treats elements as strings.\n\nLet me test this function with some examples.\n\nExample 1: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nSum: 15\n\nAverage: 3\n\nMinimum: 1\n\nMaximum: 5\n\nMedian: 3\n\nExample 2: arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]\n\nSum: 23\n\nAverage: 23/6 \u2248 3.833\n\nMinimum: 1\n\nMaximum: 9\n\nMedian: (3+4)/2 = 3.5\n\nExample 3: arr = []\n\nShould return all properties as null.\n\nExample 4: arr = [10]\n\nSum: 10\n\nAverage: 10\n\nMinimum: 10\n\nMaximum: 10\n\nMedian: 10\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider if the array has negative numbers.\n\nExample 5: arr = [-1, -2, -3]\n\nSum: -6\n\nAverage: -2\n\nMinimum: -3\n\nMaximum: -1\n\nMedian: -2\n\nLooks good.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if the array has floating-point numbers.\n\nExample 6: arr = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5]\n\nSum: 7.5\n\nAverage: 2.5\n\nMinimum: 1.5\n\nMaximum: 3.5\n\nMedian: 2.5\n\nSeems correct.\n\nI think this function should work for various cases. I might want to add comments for clarity, but since the task asks for plain format, I'll keep it concise.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object containing the sum, average, minimum, maximum, and median of the array. The function should handle arrays of different lengths and number ranges appropriately.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sum**: Use the `reduce` method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.\n2. **Average**: Divide the sum by the length of the array. Handle the case where the array is empty to avoid division by zero.\n3. **Minimum and Maximum**: Use `Math.min` and `Math.max` with the spread operator to find the smallest and largest numbers in the array.\n4. **Median**: \n   - Sort the array in ascending order.\n   - If the array length is odd, the median is the middle element.\n   - If the array length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```javascript\nfunction arrayStats(arr) {\n  if (arr.length === 0) {\n    return {\n      sum: null,\n      average: null,\n      minimum: null,\n      maximum: null,\n      median: null\n    };\n  }\n\n  const sum = arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);\n  const average = sum / arr.length;\n  const minimum = Math.min(...arr);\n  const maximum = Math.max(...arr);\n\n  // Clone and sort the array for median calculation\n  const sortedArr = [...arr].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const mid = Math.floor(sortedArr.length / 2);\n\n  let median;\n  if (sortedArr.length % 2 === 0) {\n    median = (sortedArr[mid - 1] + sortedArr[mid]) / 2;\n  } else {\n    median = sortedArr[mid];\n  }\n\n  return {\n    sum: sum,\n    average: average,\n    minimum: minimum,\n    maximum: maximum,\n    median: median\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sum**: Accumulates the total by iterating through the array using `reduce`.\n- **Average**: Computes the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements.\n- **Minimum and Maximum**: Uses built-in Math functions with the spread operator to find the smallest and largest values.\n- **Median**: \n  - Clones the original array to avoid mutating it.\n  - Sorts the cloned array in ascending order.\n  - Calculates the median based on whether the array length is odd or even.\n\nThis function handles various cases, including empty arrays and arrays with negative or floating-point numbers, ensuring robustness and accuracy in computations."
