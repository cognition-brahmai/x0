        "content": "So, we have this problem here about two factories producing widgets. Factory A makes 2000 widgets per day, and Factory B makes 1500 widgets per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for both factories combined to produce a total of 50,000 widgets.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many widgets both factories produce together in one day. Since Factory A makes 2000 and Factory B makes 1500, I can add those together to get the total daily production.\n\nSo, 2000 + 1500 = 3500 widgets per day combined.\n\nNow, we need to reach a total of 50,000 widgets. To find out how many days that will take, I can divide the total number of widgets needed by the number of widgets produced per day.\n\nSo, 50,000 \u00f7 3500 = ?\n\nLet me do that calculation. 3500 times 14 is 49,000, and then there's 1,000 left to reach 50,000. So, 49,000 \u00f7 3500 = 14 days, and then 1,000 \u00f7 3500 is approximately 0.2857 days.\n\nSo, total days would be 14.2857 days.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express that as a fraction. 1,000 \u00f7 3500 simplifies to 2/7, since both numerator and denominator can be divided by 500.\n\nSo, total days is 14 and 2/7 days.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express it in days and hours, we can convert the fractional part into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2/7 of a day is (2/7) \u00d7 24 = 48/7 \u2248 6.857 hours.\n\nSo, approximately 14 days and 6.857 hours.\n\nBut maybe sticking with the fractional days is precise enough.\n\nSo, the final answer is that it takes 14 and 2/7 days for both factories combined to produce 50,000 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14\\ \\text{days and}\\ \\frac{2}{7}\\ \\text{of a day}} \\]"
