        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains leaving from different stations at the same time, heading towards each other. Station A and Station B are 500 miles apart. The first train from Station A is going at 60 mph, and the second train from Station B is going at 40 mph. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nOkay, so since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the combined speed is 60 mph plus 40 mph, which is 100 mph. That makes sense because they're closing the distance between them at that rate.\n\nNow, the total distance is 500 miles. If they're closing in at 100 miles per hour, I can find the time by dividing the distance by the combined speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed. That would be 500 miles divided by 100 mph, which is 5 hours.\n\nSo, if both trains leave at 9:00 AM, and it takes 5 hours for them to meet, then they should meet at 2:00 PM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should approach it differently to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s think about it in terms of the distance each train covers. Let\u2019s say they meet after t hours.\n\nIn t hours, the first train would have traveled 60t miles, and the second train would have traveled 40t miles. Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the stations, which is 500 miles.\n\nSo, 60t + 40t = 500.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 100t = 500.\n\nSolving for t, t = 500 / 100 = 5 hours.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there any stops or speed changes? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume constant speeds.\n\nAlso, I should confirm the times. Both trains leave at 9:00 AM, and it's a 5-hour journey to the meeting point. Adding 5 hours to 9:00 AM indeed brings us to 2:00 PM.\n\nI think that's the answer. The trains will meet at 2:00 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2:00 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
