        "content": "Let's see. So, a bee lands on a flower every 10 seconds and stays there for 5 seconds before flying off to the next one. I need to find out how much time the bee spends landing on flowers in one hour.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total time for one complete cycle of landing and flying. The bee lands on a flower and stays for 5 seconds, then flies off for 5 seconds (since it lands every 10 seconds total, and it stays for 5 seconds, the flight time must be 10 - 5 = 5 seconds).\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. If the bee lands every 10 seconds and stays for 5 seconds each time, then the cycle time is 10 seconds per cycle.\n\nBut, if it lands every 10 seconds, and stays for 5 seconds each time, does that mean that the time between leaving one flower and landing on the next is 10 seconds?\n\nWait, maybe I should consider it like this: the bee is on a flower for 5 seconds, then in the next 5 seconds, it flies to the next flower, and at time t=10 seconds, it lands on the next flower, and so on.\n\nSo, each cycle is 10 seconds: 5 seconds landing + 5 seconds flying.\n\nTherefore, in each 10-second cycle, the bee spends 5 seconds landing on a flower.\n\nNow, to find out how much time the bee spends landing on flowers in one hour, I need to calculate how many 10-second cycles there are in one hour and then multiply that by the 5 seconds spent landing in each cycle.\n\nFirst, convert one hour to seconds:\n\n1 hour = 60 minutes \u00d7 60 seconds per minute = 3600 seconds.\n\nNow, number of 10-second cycles in 3600 seconds:\n\n3600 seconds \u00f7 10 seconds per cycle = 360 cycles.\n\nEach cycle includes 5 seconds of landing time, so total landing time is:\n\n360 cycles \u00d7 5 seconds per cycle = 1800 seconds.\n\nNow, to make it more understandable, let's convert 1800 seconds back to minutes:\n\n1800 seconds \u00f7 60 seconds per minute = 30 minutes.\n\nSo, the bee spends 30 minutes landing on flowers in one hour.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf the bee is landing every 10 seconds and staying for 5 seconds each time, over an hour, that would indeed accumulate to 30 minutes of landing time.\n\nAlternatively, since each cycle is 10 seconds and 5 seconds are spent landing, that means 50% of the time is spent landing.\n\nTherefore, in one hour, 50% of 60 minutes is 30 minutes.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the bee spends 30 minutes landing on flowers in one hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
