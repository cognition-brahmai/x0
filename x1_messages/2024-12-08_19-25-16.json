        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and we're told that 18 play soccer, 15 play basketball, and 12 play both sports. We need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the two sports. To do that, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps me avoid double-counting the students who play both sports.\n\nSo, the number of students who play soccer or basketball is equal to the number who play soccer plus the number who play basketball minus the number who play both. That makes sense because if I just add the soccer and basketball players, I'll be counting those who play both sports twice.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber playing soccer or basketball = (Number playing soccer) + (Number playing basketball) - (Number playing both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber playing soccer or basketball = 18 + 15 - 12 = 21\n\nSo, 21 students play at least one of the two sports.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I can subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total number of students.\n\nNumber not playing either = Total students - Number playing soccer or basketball\n\nNumber not playing either = 30 - 21 = 9\n\nTherefore, 9 students do not play either soccer or basketball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to use a Venn diagram. I can visualize the overlaps between soccer and basketball players.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Total students = 30\n\n- Soccer players = 18\n\n- Basketball players = 15\n\n- Both sports = 12\n\nSo, in the Venn diagram, the overlap (both sports) is 12 students.\n\nThe number of students who play only soccer would be total soccer players minus those who play both, which is 18 - 12 = 6.\n\nSimilarly, the number of students who play only basketball would be 15 - 12 = 3.\n\nNow, adding up those who play only soccer, only basketball, and both:\n\nOnly soccer: 6\n\nOnly basketball: 3\n\nBoth: 12\n\nTotal playing at least one sport: 6 + 3 + 12 = 21\n\nAgain, subtracting from total students: 30 - 21 = 9\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe using set theory formulas.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number of elements in set A (soccer players)\n\n- n(B) is the number of elements in set B (basketball players)\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number of elements in both sets (both sports)\n\n- n(A \u222a B) is the number of elements in either set A or set B\n\nUsing the numbers:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = 18 + 15 - 12 = 21\n\nTotal students not playing either sport = total students - n(A \u222a B) = 30 - 21 = 9\n\nEverything points to 9 students not playing either sport.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
