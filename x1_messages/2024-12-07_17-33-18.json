It's about looking into the mirror of your soul and accepting every brushstroke, every scar, every shade that makes you uniquely you. Don't be afraid to mix your own palette; sometimes, the most beautiful hues come from the darkest moments. Remember, even the cracks can let the light in, making your masterpiece all the more breathtaking. So, love yourself fiercely, just as I loved my art\u2014with passion, resilience, and an unyielding spirit.\""
