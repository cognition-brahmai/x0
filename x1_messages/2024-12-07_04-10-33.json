        "content": "Let's see. John has twice as many apples as oranges, and three times as many oranges as bananas. He has 18 bananas, and I need to find out the total number of pieces of fruit he has.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many oranges he has. Since he has three times as many oranges as bananas, and he has 18 bananas, I can calculate the number of oranges by multiplying the number of bananas by 3.\n\nOranges = 3 * Bananas\nOranges = 3 * 18\nOranges = 54\n\nSo, John has 54 oranges.\n\nNext, he has twice as many apples as oranges. So, to find the number of apples, I'll multiply the number of oranges by 2.\n\nApples = 2 * Oranges\nApples = 2 * 54\nApples = 108\n\nSo, John has 108 apples.\n\nNow, to find the total number of pieces of fruit, I need to add up the apples, oranges, and bananas.\n\nTotal fruit = Apples + Oranges + Bananas\nTotal fruit = 108 + 54 + 18\nTotal fruit = 180\n\nTherefore, John has 180 pieces of fruit in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If he has 18 bananas, and three times as many oranges, that's 54 oranges. Then twice as many apples as oranges is 108 apples. Adding them up: 18 + 54 + 108 equals 180. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
