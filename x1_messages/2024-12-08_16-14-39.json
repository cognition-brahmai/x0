        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 units of product A and 300 units of product B each day. Each unit of product A takes 2 hours to make, and each unit of product B takes 3 hours. I need to find out the total hours it takes to produce all the products in a day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total time for product A. Since each unit takes 2 hours and they make 200 units, I can multiply 200 by 2. That should give me the total time for A.\n\n200 units * 2 hours/unit = 400 hours.\n\nNext, for product B, each unit takes 3 hours, and they produce 300 units. So, 300 units * 3 hours/unit should give me the total time for B.\n\n300 units * 3 hours/unit = 900 hours.\n\nNow, to find the total time for both products, I just need to add the times together.\n\n400 hours + 900 hours = 1300 hours.\n\nSo, it takes 1300 hours to produce all the products in a day.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I can calculate the total time together.\n\nTotal time = (200 units * 2 hours/unit) + (300 units * 3 hours/unit) = 400 + 900 = 1300 hours.\n\nYeah, that matches what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the time per unit for each product and the number of units.\n\nTotal time = (number of A * time per A) + (number of B * time per B).\n\nWhich is the same as what I did.\n\nI don't think there's anything missing here. The answer should be 1300 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1300} \\]"
