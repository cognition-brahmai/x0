        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a rectangle that's originally 10 inches long and 6 inches wide. Then, it says if I double the length and triple the width, I need to find out what the new area of the rectangle would be.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to remember how to find the area of a rectangle. I think area is just length times width, right? So, for the original rectangle, the area would be 10 inches times 6 inches, which is 60 square inches. But the question is about the new dimensions, not the original.\n\nSo, doubling the length: original length is 10 inches, so double that would be 2 times 10, which is 20 inches. And tripling the width: original width is 6 inches, so triple that would be 3 times 6, which is 18 inches.\n\nNow, the new rectangle has a length of 20 inches and a width of 18 inches. To find the new area, I just multiply these two, right? So, 20 times 18.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20 times 18 is... hmm, 20 times 10 is 200, and 20 times 8 is 160, so total would be 200 plus 160, which is 360 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe in terms of the original area. The original area is 60 square inches, and the length is doubled and the width is tripled.\n\nIf I double the length, that would multiply the area by 2, and tripling the width would multiply the area by 3. So, overall, the area should be multiplied by 2 times 3, which is 6.\n\nSo, 6 times the original area of 60 square inches is 360 square inches. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nJust to double-check, I can think about the dimensions again. Original length 10 inches doubled is 20 inches, width 6 inches tripled is 18 inches. Area is 20 times 18, which is indeed 360 square inches.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the new area of the rectangle would be 360 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
