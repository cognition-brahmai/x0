        "content": "So I have to find the slope of the line that passes through the points (3, 5) and (-1, 2). I remember that slope is a measure of how steep the line is, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps to calculate it. Let me try to recall the formula for slope.\n\nI think the formula for slope, denoted by m, between two points (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082) is:\n\nm = (y\u2082 - y\u2081) / (x\u2082 - x\u2081)\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, I need to plug in the coordinates of the two points into this formula.\n\nLet's designate (3, 5) as point 1, so x\u2081 = 3 and y\u2081 = 5.\n\nThen, (-1, 2) will be point 2, so x\u2082 = -1 and y\u2082 = 2.\n\nNow, substituting these values into the formula:\n\nm = (2 - 5) / (-1 - 3)\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator: 2 - 5 = -3\n\nThen, the denominator: -1 - 3 = -4\n\nSo, m = -3 / -4\n\nNegative divided by negative is positive, so m = 3/4\n\nWait, but I recall that slope can be negative or positive. In this case, since both the numerator and denominator are negative, they cancel out to give a positive slope.\n\nBut let me double-check if I assigned the points correctly. Does it matter which point I choose as point 1 and which as point 2?\n\nLet me try switching the points to see.\n\nIf I let (-1, 2) be point 1, so x\u2081 = -1 and y\u2081 = 2.\n\nThen, (3, 5) is point 2, so x\u2082 = 3 and y\u2082 = 5.\n\nNow, m = (5 - 2) / (3 - (-1)) = 3 / (3 + 1) = 3/4\n\nSame result. So, it doesn't matter which point is chosen as point 1 or point 2; the slope comes out the same.\n\nAlright, so the slope is 3/4. But let me understand what this means.\n\nSlope is rise over run, right? So, rise is the change in y, and run is the change in x.\n\nIn this case, for every 4 units you move to the right (increase in x), the line rises 3 units (increase in y).\n\nAlternatively, if you move 4 units to the left (decrease in x), the line falls 3 units (decrease in y).\n\nSo, the slope being positive indicates that the line is increasing from left to right.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I plot the points (3,5) and (-1,2), and draw a line through them, it should indeed be going upwards as I move from left to right.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can calculate the slope again using the coordinates differently.\n\nLet's try using the formula:\n\nm = (y\u2081 - y\u2082) / (x\u2081 - x\u2082)\n\nUsing the original points: (3,5) and (-1,2)\n\nSo, m = (5 - 2) / (3 - (-1)) = 3 / 4\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, m = (y\u2082 - y\u2081) / (x\u2082 - x\u2081) = (2 - 5) / (-1 - 3) = (-3)/(-4) = 3/4\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nGood, that gives me confidence that I'm doing this correctly.\n\nIs there another way to think about slope that might help solidify my understanding?\n\nWell, I've heard that slope is also the tangent of the angle that the line makes with the positive x-axis.\n\nSo, if m = tan(\u03b8), then \u03b8 = arctan(m)\n\nIn this case, m = 3/4, so \u03b8 = arctan(3/4)\n\nI can calculate that if I have a calculator, but for now, it's just good to know that relationship.\n\nAdditionally, slope is related to the rate of change of y with respect to x.\n\nIn this context, for every unit increase in x, y increases by m units.\n\nSo, if m = 3/4, then for every 4 units increase in x, y increases by 3 units.\n\nThat makes sense with the rise over run interpretation.\n\nLet me see if there are any special cases I should be aware of.\n\nFor example, if the two points have the same x-coordinate, meaning x\u2081 = x\u2082, then the denominator in the slope formula would be zero.\n\nBut division by zero is undefined, so the slope would be undefined.\n\nThat corresponds to a vertical line, which indeed doesn't have a defined slope.\n\nOn the other hand, if y\u2081 = y\u2082, meaning the two points have the same y-coordinate, then the numerator is zero, so m = 0.\n\nThat corresponds to a horizontal line, which has zero slope.\n\nSo, it's good to remember those special cases.\n\nIn this problem, since x\u2081 \u2260 x\u2082 and y\u2081 \u2260 y\u2082, we have a line with a positive slope of 3/4.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider?\n\nWell, maybe I can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to verify.\n\nThe point-slope form is:\n\ny - y\u2081 = m(x - x\u2081)\n\nUsing point (3,5) and m = 3/4:\n\ny - 5 = (3/4)(x - 3)\n\nLet me see if this equation holds for the other point, (-1,2).\n\nPlugging in x = -1 and y = 2:\n\n2 - 5 = (3/4)(-1 - 3)\n\n-3 = (3/4)(-4)\n\n-3 = -3\n\nIt checks out, so the slope is indeed 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, I could find the equation using both points and see if the slope is consistent.\n\nUsing points (3,5) and (-1,2), the general form of a line is y = mx + b.\n\nPlugging in (3,5):\n\n5 = 3m + b\n\nAnd plugging in (-1,2):\n\n2 = -m + b\n\nNow, I have a system of equations:\n\n1) 5 = 3m + b\n\n2) 2 = -m + b\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n5 - 2 = 3m - (-m) + b - b\n\n3 = 4m\n\nSo, m = 3/4\n\nWhich matches what I found earlier.\n\nThen, plugging m back into one of the equations to find b.\n\nUsing equation 2:\n\n2 = - (3/4) + b\n\nSo, b = 2 + 3/4 = 11/4\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is y = (3/4)x + 11/4\n\nI can test this with one of the points to verify.\n\nUsing (3,5):\n\ny = (3/4)(3) + 11/4 = 9/4 + 11/4 = 20/4 = 5\n\nCorrect.\n\nUsing (-1,2):\n\ny = (3/4)(-1) + 11/4 = -3/4 + 11/4 = 8/4 = 2\n\nAlso correct.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI think I've thoroughly understood how to find the slope between two points and verified it in multiple ways.\n\nJust to summarize the steps for finding slope between two points (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082):\n\n1. Identify the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. Apply the slope formula: m = (y\u2082 - y\u2081)/(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\n\n3. Simplify the fraction if possible.\n\n4. Interpret the slope in terms of rise over run.\n\n5. (Optional) Verify by using the slope in the equation of the line and checking with the other point.\n\nIn this case, the slope is 3/4, indicating a positive incline.\n\nI feel confident with this now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}} \\]"
