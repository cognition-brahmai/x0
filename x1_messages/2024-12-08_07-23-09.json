        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if a baker uses 2 eggs to make 3 cupcakes, how many eggs will he use to make 18 cupcakes? And I need to show the calculation process. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cupcakes. The problem says that 2 eggs are used for 3 cupcakes. So, it's like a ratio: 2 eggs for every 3 cupcakes.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 18 cupcakes. To do this, I can set up a proportion because the relationship between eggs and cupcakes should be constant.\n\nSo, the proportion can be set up like this:\n\n2 eggs / 3 cupcakes = x eggs / 18 cupcakes\n\nHere, x is the number of eggs needed for 18 cupcakes, and I need to solve for x.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n2 eggs * 18 cupcakes = 3 cupcakes * x eggs\n\nThat gives:\n\n36 = 3x\n\nNow, to find x, I need to divide both sides by 3:\n\n36 / 3 = x\n\nSo, x = 12\n\nTherefore, the baker will use 12 eggs to make 18 cupcakes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to find out how many eggs are needed for one cupcake and then multiply by 18.\n\nSo, if 2 eggs make 3 cupcakes, then for one cupcake, it would be 2/3 eggs.\n\nSo, for 18 cupcakes, it would be (2/3) * 18.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(2/3) * 18 = (2 * 18) / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12\n\nAgain, I get 12 eggs.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of multiples. If 3 cupcakes require 2 eggs, then to get to 18 cupcakes, I need to see how many times 3 goes into 18.\n\n18 divided by 3 is 6.\n\nSo, I need 6 times the number of eggs.\n\n6 * 2 = 12 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me try one more way to be sure. Maybe using ratios.\n\nThe ratio of eggs to cupcakes is 2:3.\n\nI need to find the equivalent ratio for eggs to 18 cupcakes.\n\nSo, 2:3 = x:18\n\nSolving for x, cross-multiplying, 2*18 = 3*x \u2192 36 = 3x \u2192 x=12\n\nOnce again, 12 eggs.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer. All these different methods are leading me to the same conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of scaling.\n\nIf 3 cupcakes require 2 eggs, then scaling up to 18 cupcakes is scaling by a factor of 6.\n\nSo, 2 eggs * 6 = 12 eggs.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI don't think there's any other way this could be interpreted. The relationship is directly proportional, so the number of eggs increases linearly with the number of cupcakes.\n\nI feel pretty confident saying that the answer is 12 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
