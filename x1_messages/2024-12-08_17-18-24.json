        "content": "Let's see here. So, the train goes at a steady 60 miles per hour, and it takes 3 hours to get from station A to station B. First, I need to figure out the distance between A and B.\n\nIf speed is 60 miles per hour and time is 3 hours, then distance should be speed multiplied by time, right? So, 60 miles/hour times 3 hours equals 180 miles. That means station B is 180 miles away from station A.\n\nNow, station C is twice as far away from station A as station B is. So, if B is 180 miles away, then C must be 2 times 180, which is 360 miles away from A.\n\nThe train is moving at the same constant speed of 60 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to travel 360 miles at 60 miles per hour, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time equals 360 miles divided by 60 miles per hour, which is 6 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. If the train travels at 60 miles per hour and station C is 360 miles away, then yes, it should take 6 hours.\n\nAlternatively, since station C is twice as far as station B, and it takes 3 hours to get to station B, then it should take twice as much time to get to station C. Twice 3 hours is 6 hours, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 6 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
