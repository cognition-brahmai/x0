        "content": "While the concept album as we know it today gained significant prominence in the 1960s with rock music, the idea of thematically connected songs on an album predates this period. In the 1940s and 1950s, artists like Frank Sinatra released concept albums such as \"In the Wee Small Hours\" and \"Come Fly with Me,\" which explored specific themes through their song selections. However, it was in the 1960s that rock bands began to experiment more extensively with concept albums, creating narratives or unified themes across entire albums. This evolution was influenced by advancements in recording technology and changes in the music industry, allowing artists greater creative freedom to craft cohesive musical stories."
