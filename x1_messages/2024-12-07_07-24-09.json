This technique allows plants to grow directly in nutrient-rich water, often with the support of an inert medium like perlite, coconut coir, or clay pellets. Hydroponics is widely used in controlled environments such as greenhouses and indoor farms, enabling year-round crop production and efficient use of resources."
