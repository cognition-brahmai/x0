        "content": "I think the term you're looking for is \"Pointillism.\" It's a style of painting in which tiny dots of color are applied to a canvas in patterns to form an image. The idea is that the viewer's eye will blend the dots together to perceive a fuller image. This technique was developed in the late 19th century, primarily by Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Their work was influenced by scientific theories about color and perception. So, Pointillism is all about using these small, distinct dots of color to create a larger picture.\n"
