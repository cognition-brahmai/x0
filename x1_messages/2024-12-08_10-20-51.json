        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly. There's a class of 25 students, which includes 10 boys and 15 girls. We're supposed to find the probability that if we choose 5 students at random to form a group, exactly 3 of them are boys and 2 are girls.\n\nOkay, probability problems can be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this. First things first, I need to recall the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose any 5 students out of 25, regardless of gender. And the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose exactly 3 boys and 2 girls.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the total number of possible outcomes. Since the order in which we choose the students doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 5 students out of 25 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, for the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[ C(25, 5) = \\frac{25!}{5!(25 - 5)!} = \\frac{25!}{5! \\times 20!} \\]\n\nI don't need to calculate this just yet, but it's good to know that this is the expression for the total number of ways to choose 5 students out of 25.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is choosing exactly 3 boys and 2 girls. Since there are 10 boys and 15 girls, I can calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 10 and 2 girls out of 15, and then multiply those two numbers together because these are independent choices.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 10 is:\n\n\\[ C(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10 - 3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3! \\times 7!} \\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 15 is:\n\n\\[ C(15, 2) = \\frac{15!}{2!(15 - 2)!} = \\frac{15!}{2! \\times 13!} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is:\n\n\\[ C(10, 3) \\times C(15, 2) \\]\n\nNow, putting it all together, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{C(10, 3) \\times C(15, 2)}{C(25, 5)} \\]\n\nI think that's the correct setup for the problem. Now, I need to compute these combinations to get the numerical probability.\n\nFirst, let's compute \\( C(10, 3) \\):\n\n\\[ C(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3! \\times 7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{6} = \\frac{720}{6} = 120 \\]\n\nNext, \\( C(15, 2) \\):\n\n\\[ C(15, 2) = \\frac{15!}{2! \\times 13!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 13!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105 \\]\n\nNow, \\( C(25, 5) \\):\n\n\\[ C(25, 5) = \\frac{25!}{5! \\times 20!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20!}{120 \\times 20!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21}{120} \\]\n\nLet me calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 24 = 600 \\]\n\n\\[ 600 \\times 23 = 13,800 \\]\n\n\\[ 13,800 \\times 22 = 303,600 \\]\n\n\\[ 303,600 \\times 21 = 6,375,600 \\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6,375,600}{120} = 53,130 \\]\n\nSo, \\( C(25, 5) = 53,130 \\)\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is:\n\n\\[ C(10, 3) \\times C(15, 2) = 120 \\times 105 = 12,600 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{12,600}{53,130} \\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 15:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12,600 \\div 15}{53,130 \\div 15} = \\frac{840}{3,542} \\]\n\nI can simplify further by dividing both by 2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{840 \\div 2}{3,542 \\div 2} = \\frac{420}{1,771} \\]\n\nI think that's the simplest form. To get a decimal, I can divide 420 by 1,771:\n\n\\[ 420 \\div 1,771 \\approx 0.2371 \\]\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2371, or 23.71%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, \\( C(10, 3) = 120 \\) seems correct.\n\nThen, \\( C(15, 2) = 105 \\) also seems correct.\n\n\\( C(25, 5) = 53,130 \\) matches what I recall from previous calculations.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is indeed \\( 120 \\times 105 = 12,600 \\).\n\nThen, the probability is \\( \\frac{12,600}{53,130} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{420}{1,771} \\), and the decimal is approximately 0.2371.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the probability of selecting exactly 3 boys and 2 girls in a group of 5 students from a class of 10 boys and 15 girls is approximately 23.71%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{420}{1771}} \\]"
