        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"If three cats catch three mice in three minutes, how long will it take hundred cats to catch hundred mice?\" Hmm, let's see. This seems like a straightforward problem, but I think I should think carefully about it to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rate at which the cats are catching mice. If three cats catch three mice in three minutes, that means that each cat is catching one mouse in three minutes. Right? Because 3 cats catch 3 mice in 3 minutes, so divided by 3, each cat catches one mouse in 3 minutes.\n\nSo, if one cat catches one mouse in 3 minutes, then hundred cats should catch hundred mice in the same amount of time, assuming each cat works independently and at the same rate.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. If one cat catches one mouse in 3 minutes, then hundred cats would catch hundred mice in 3 minutes, because all hundred cats are working simultaneously, each catching one mouse in 3 minutes.\n\nBut let me think about it differently. Maybe I should consider the rate of catching mice per cat per minute. If three cats catch three mice in three minutes, then the total mouse-catching rate is 3 mice divided by 3 minutes, which is 1 mouse per minute for all three cats together. So, the rate per cat would be 1/3 mouse per minute.\n\nNow, if I have hundred cats, each catching mice at a rate of 1/3 mouse per minute, then together they would catch 100*(1/3) = 100/3 mice per minute.\n\nSo, to catch hundred mice, the time required would be 100 mice divided by 100/3 mice per minute, which is 100 / (100/3) = 100 * (3/100) = 3 minutes.\n\nWait, that's the same answer I got earlier. So, both approaches lead to the same conclusion: it takes 3 minutes for hundred cats to catch hundred mice.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't any trick here. Sometimes these kinds of problems have some tricky elements that aren't immediately obvious. For example, maybe the mice are being caught simultaneously, or perhaps there are limitations on the number of mice available or something like that.\n\nIn this problem, it seems straightforward. The assumption is that each cat catches mice independently of the others, and there are enough mice for all cats to catch without interfering with each other.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the time should remain the same regardless of the number of cats and mice, as long as the ratio remains the same.\n\nWait, but in the original scenario, the ratio is 3 cats to 3 mice to 3 minutes. So, the number of cats is equal to the number of mice, and the time is 3 minutes.\n\nIn the scaled-up scenario, the number of cats is equal to the number of mice, just a larger quantity: 100 cats to 100 mice.\n\nIf each cat catches one mouse in 3 minutes, then having 100 cats should catch 100 mice in the same 3 minutes.\n\nSo, yes, I think the answer is 3 minutes.\n\nBut let me consider another angle. Suppose that the mice are being caught one at a time by each cat. So, one cat catches one mouse in 3 minutes. Therefore, hundred cats would catch hundred mice in 3 minutes, since they're all working at the same time.\n\nAlternatively, if the cats had to catch the mice one after the other, it might take longer, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The problem implies that the cats are catching mice simultaneously.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total \"cat-minutes\" required to catch the mice. In the original scenario, 3 cats catch 3 mice in 3 minutes, so the total cat-minutes is 3 cats * 3 minutes = 9 cat-minutes per 3 mice, which is 3 cat-minutes per mouse.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. If 3 cats catch 3 mice in 3 minutes, then the total cat-minutes is 3 cats * 3 minutes = 9 cat-minutes for 3 mice, so that's 3 cat-minutes per mouse.\n\nSo, each mouse requires 3 cat-minutes to be caught.\n\nTherefore, for hundred mice, the total cat-minutes required would be 100 mice * 3 cat-minutes/mouse = 300 cat-minutes.\n\nNow, if you have hundred cats working simultaneously, the time required would be total cat-minutes divided by the number of cats, which is 300 cat-minutes / 100 cats = 3 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me try one more approach to be absolutely sure. If three cats catch three mice in three minutes, then scaling up proportionally, hundred times more cats should catch hundred times more mice in the same amount of time.\n\nSo, 3 cats -> 3 mice in 3 minutes\n\n100 cats -> 100 mice in 3 minutes\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think in terms of rates:\n\nRate per cat = 1 mouse / 3 minutes\n\nTotal rate for 100 cats = 100 mice / 3 minutes\n\nTime to catch 100 mice = 100 mice / (100 mice / 3 minutes) = 3 minutes\n\nOnce again, confirming the same answer.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the answer is indeed 3 minutes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any other factors at play here. For example, maybe there are limitations on the space where the cats are hunting, or perhaps the mice are moving around and affecting each other's capture rates. However, the problem doesn't mention any such complications, so I think it's safe to assume that the cats are independent and each catches one mouse in 3 minutes.\n\nAnother possible consideration is whether the number of mice affects the time it takes for the cats to catch them. For instance, if there are more mice, maybe the cats have an easier time finding them, or perhaps the mice can hide better. But again, the problem doesn't suggest any such dependencies, so I'll stick with the initial conclusion.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it would take hundred cats 3 minutes to catch hundred mice, given the initial rate at which the cats catch mice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
