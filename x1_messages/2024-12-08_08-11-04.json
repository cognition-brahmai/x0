        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria population growth. It says that the bacteria population doubles every 4 hours, and there are initially 500 bacteria. I need to figure out how many there will be after 20 hours.\n\nAlright, first things first, I know that exponential growth is involved here because the population is doubling at regular intervals. The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times e^{rt} \\]\n\nBut wait, in this case, since it's doubling every fixed period, maybe there's a better way to approach it.\n\nLet me think. If the population doubles every 4 hours, then in 4 hours, the population multiplies by 2. So, starting with 500 bacteria:\n\nAfter 4 hours: \\( 500 \\times 2 = 1000 \\)\n\nAfter 8 hours: \\( 1000 \\times 2 = 2000 \\)\n\nAfter 12 hours: \\( 2000 \\times 2 = 4000 \\)\n\nAfter 16 hours: \\( 4000 \\times 2 = 8000 \\)\n\nAfter 20 hours: \\( 8000 \\times 2 = 16000 \\)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because from 16 to 20 hours is only 4 hours, so it should double once more. But let me check if there's a more systematic way to do this.\n\nI recall that for exponential growth with a fixed doubling time, the formula can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P(t) \\) is the population at time \\( t \\)\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population\n\n- \\( T \\) is the doubling time\n\n- \\( t \\) is the elapsed time\n\nSo, in this problem:\n\n- \\( P_0 = 500 \\)\n\n- \\( T = 4 \\) hours\n\n- \\( t = 20 \\) hours\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ P(20) = 500 \\times 2^{(20/4)} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ P(20) = 500 \\times 2^5 \\]\n\nNow, \\( 2^5 = 32 \\), so:\n\n\\[ P(20) = 500 \\times 32 = 16,000 \\]\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier by doubling step by step.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's verify with the exponential growth formula using \\( e^{rt} \\).\n\nFirst, I need to find the growth rate \\( r \\). I know that the population doubles every 4 hours, so:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 \\times e^{rt} \\]\n\nAt \\( t = 4 \\) hours, \\( P(4) = 2 \\times P_0 \\), so:\n\n\\[ 2P_0 = P_0 \\times e^{4r} \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( P_0 \\):\n\n\\[ 2 = e^{4r} \\]\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(2) = 4r \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{4} \\]\n\nNow, plug this back into the exponential growth formula for \\( t = 20 \\) hours:\n\n\\[ P(20) = 500 \\times e^{(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{4} \\times 20)} \\]\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\ln(2)}{4} \\times 20 = 5 \\ln(2) \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(20) = 500 \\times e^{5 \\ln(2)} \\]\n\nAnd since \\( e^{\\ln(2^5)} = 2^5 = 32 \\), then:\n\n\\[ P(20) = 500 \\times 32 = 16,000 \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the number of doubling periods in 20 hours. Since each doubling period is 4 hours, the number of doubling periods in 20 hours is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the population after 20 hours is the initial population multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the number of doubling periods:\n\n\\[ P(20) = 500 \\times 2^5 = 500 \\times 32 = 16,000 \\]\n\nOnce more, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The population after 20 hours will be 16,000 bacteria.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16000} \\]"
