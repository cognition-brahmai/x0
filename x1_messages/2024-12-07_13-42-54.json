        "content": "Hmm, that's an interesting question. So, the G20 is a group of 20 major economies in the world, which includes both developed and developing countries. It's focused on addressing major issues in the global economy. Now, to find the most populated country not in the G20, I need to think about which large countries aren't part of this group.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the G20 members include countries like the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Australia, Canada, and South Korea, among others, plus some invited countries like Spain and the EU as a bloc.\n\nGiven that, some large countries that aren't in the G20 come to mind, such as Pakistan, Iran, Nigeria, and Bangladesh. Now, in terms of population, Bangladesh is quite significant. According to recent data, Bangladesh has a population of over 160 million people, which is substantial.\n\nBut let's check other countries not in the G20 to see if any have larger populations. Nigeria, for instance, has a population exceeding 200 million, which is even larger than Bangladesh's. So, Nigeria might be a candidate for the most populated country not in the G20.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that Nigeria isn't part of the G20. As far as I know, Nigeria isn't a member of the G20, although it's an important economy in Africa. So, if Nigeria has a larger population than Bangladesh and isn't in the G20, then it might be the answer.\n\nBut wait, there's also Pakistan, which has a population of over 220 million people. Is Pakistan part of the G20? Actually, Pakistan is not a member of the G20. So, with a population exceeding 220 million, Pakistan might be more populous than Nigeria.\n\nHold on, I need to verify the population figures because these numbers can change rapidly, and I want to make sure I have the most accurate information.\n\nAccording to the latest United Nations estimates, Pakistan's population is around 225 million, Nigeria's is approximately 211 million, and Bangladesh's is about 164 million. So, Pakistan seems to have a larger population than Nigeria.\n\nBut, I should also consider other countries not in the G20 that might have large populations. For example, Ethiopia has a population of over 115 million, which is sizeable but still less than Pakistan's. Similarly, Egypt has a population of around 102 million, which is also lower.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, Pakistan appears to be the most populated country not part of the G20.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that population figures can vary depending on the source and the time of estimation. Also, the G20 membership might change over time, so it's possible that some countries could be invited or become members in the future.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth mentioning that while Pakistan isn't a formal member of the G20, it has been invited as a guest country to some G20 summits due to its strategic importance in the region.\n\nIn conclusion, as of now, Pakistan seems to be the most populated country not part of the G20, with a population exceeding 220 million people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Pakistan}} \\]"
