        "content": "Alright, so the store is selling books for $15 each, and they're giving a discount of 20%. I need to find out how much each book will cost after the discount. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. Percentage discount is a reduction in price based on a percentage of the original price. So, 20% off means the customer saves 20% of the original price.\n\nTo find out how much the discount is in dollars, I need to calculate 20% of $15. I remember that \"of\" in mathematics often means multiplication, and percent means per hundred, so 20% is the same as 20/100 or 0.20.\n\nSo, the discount amount is 20% of $15, which is 0.20 times 15.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 0.20 \u00d7 15 = 3. So, the discount is $3 per book.\n\nNow, to find the final price after the discount, I need to subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n\nOriginal price: $15\n\nDiscount: $3\n\nFinal price: 15 - 3 = $12\n\nSo, each book will cost $12 after the discount.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Sometimes, instead of calculating the discount and subtracting it, people calculate what percentage of the original price they actually have to pay.\n\nIf there's a 20% discount, that means the customer pays 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\n\nSo, 80% of $15 should give me the same final price.\n\nLet me calculate that: 80% of 15 is 0.80 times 15.\n\n0.80 \u00d7 15 = 12. Yep, same answer, $12.\n\nGood, both methods give me the same result, so I can be confident that's the correct answer.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 20% of 15 is 3, and 15 minus 3 is 12. Alternatively, 80% of 15 is 12. Everything checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is $12 per book after the discount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
