        "content": "Let's see if the amusement park can build their new roller coaster within the $20 million budget. They've got a few expenses to consider: design costs and construction costs, specifically for the track.\n\nFirst, the design cost is straightforward: it's $2 million. So, that's a fixed expense.\n\nNext, the construction cost is a bit more complex. They've allocated 3,000 feet for the track, and the cost is $50,000 per foot. So, to find out the total construction cost, I need to multiply the cost per foot by the total feet of the track.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3,000 feet times $50,000 per foot.\n\nWait, that's a big number. Maybe I should break it down.\n\nFirst, 3,000 feet times $50,000 per foot.\n\nI know that 3,000 times 50,000 is the same as 3 times 50,000 with three zeros added, since 3,000 is 3 times 1,000.\n\nSo, 3 times 50,000 is 150,000.\n\nThen, adding three zeros: 150,000,000.\n\nWait, that seems too high. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, 3,000 times 50,000.\n\nI can think of it as 3 times 50, which is 150, and then add the four zeros from 50,000 and the three zeros from 3,000, but that would be seven zeros, which is 150,000,000.\n\nWait, no, 3,000 is 3 times 1,000, and 50,000 is 50 times 1,000.\n\nSo, 3 times 50 is 150, and 1,000 times 1,000 is 1,000,000.\n\nSo, 150 times 1,000,000 is 150,000,000.\n\nWait, that can't be right. That would be $150 million for the track alone, which is way over their remaining budget.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\n3,000 feet times $50,000 per foot.\n\nLet's see, 3,000 times 50,000.\n\nI can calculate it as 3 times 50,000, which is 150,000, and then multiply by 1,000 because 3,000 is 3 times 1,000.\n\nWait, no. Actually, 3,000 times 50,000.\n\nI think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI know that 1,000 feet would cost 1,000 times 50,000, which is 50,000,000.\n\nSo, 1,000 feet: $50 million.\n\nThey have 3,000 feet, so 3 times 50 million is 150 million.\n\nWait, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the track alone would cost $150 million.\n\nBut their total budget is $20 million, and design costs are $2 million.\n\nSo, the remaining budget for construction is $20 million minus $2 million, which is $18 million.\n\nBut the track costs $150 million, which is way over the $18 million available for construction.\n\nWait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake here.\n\nLet me double-check the cost per foot.\n\nThe problem says the cost of constructing the roller coaster track is $50,000 per foot.\n\nAnd they have 3,000 feet allocated for the track.\n\nSo, 3,000 times 50,000 is indeed 150,000,000.\n\nBut their total budget is only $20 million, with $2 million for design, leaving $18 million for construction.\n\nSo, $18 million for construction, but the track alone costs $150 million.\n\nThat means they're short by $150 million minus $18 million, which is $132 million.\n\nThat doesn't make sense, because they can't cover the construction costs with their budget.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $50,000 per foot includes everything, and the $2 million is for design only.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The cost of designing the roller coaster is $2 million, and the remaining budget will be used for construction. The cost of constructing the roller coaster track is $50,000 per foot, and the park has allocated 3,000 feet for the length of the track.\"\n\nSo, total budget is $20 million.\n\nDesign: $2 million.\n\nConstruction: $20 million minus $2 million = $18 million.\n\nCost of track: 3,000 feet times $50,000 per foot = $150 million.\n\nBut $150 million is greater than the $18 million available for construction.\n\nIn fact, $150 million is much greater than the total budget of $20 million.\n\nThis suggests that the park cannot construct the roller coaster within their budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $50,000 per foot is not just for the track but includes other construction costs.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"the cost of constructing the roller coaster track is $50,000 per foot.\"\n\nStill, $50,000 per foot for 3,000 feet is $150 million, which is not feasible with a $18 million construction budget.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the problem details.\n\nPerhaps the cost per foot is less, or the allocated length is shorter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $50,000 per foot includes all costs, and the $2 million is for design only.\n\nBut still, $150 million total cost exceeds the $20 million budget.\n\nTherefore, the park cannot construct the roller coaster within their budget.\n\nThey would need to either increase the budget, reduce the track length, or find a way to reduce the cost per foot.\n\nFor example, if they reduce the track length to a point where the construction cost is $18 million or less.\n\nSo, let's see what track length they could afford with $18 million.\n\nAt $50,000 per foot, the maximum track length they can afford is $18,000,000 divided by $50,000 per foot.\n\nLet me calculate that: 18,000,000 divided by 50,000.\n\nFirst, 18,000,000 divided by 50,000.\n\nI can simplify this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 1,000.\n\nSo, 18,000 divided by 50.\n\nThat's 18,000 divided by 50.\n\nWell, 50 times 360 is 18,000.\n\nSo, 360 feet.\n\nTherefore, with $18 million, they can afford a 360-foot track at $50,000 per foot.\n\nBut they planned for 3,000 feet, which would cost $150 million, way over their budget.\n\nAlternatively, if the cost per foot is incorrect, perhaps it's $50,000 for the entire track, not per foot.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as $50,000 for a 3,000-foot track would be only $50,000 total, which is much less than the $18 million available.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo in the problem.\n\nIf the cost is $50,000 per foot, then for 3,000 feet, it's $150 million, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, if the cost is $50 per foot, then 3,000 feet times $50 is $150,000.\n\nThat would be much more manageable.\n\nSimilarly, $500 per foot would be $1,500,000.\n\n$5,000 per foot would be $15,000,000.\n\nWait, that's still over the $18 million construction budget.\n\nWait, $5,000 per foot times 3,000 feet is $15,000,000.\n\nAdd the $2 million design cost, total cost is $17 million, which is under the $20 million budget.\n\nBut the problem says $50,000 per foot.\n\nUnless it's a typo and it's supposed to be $5,000 per foot.\n\nIn that case, yes, they could build it within budget.\n\nBut based on the given numbers, with $50,000 per foot for 3,000 feet, totaling $150 million for the track alone, plus $2 million for design, totaling $152 million, which is way over the $20 million budget.\n\nTherefore, the park cannot construct the roller coaster within their budget as currently planned.\n\nThey need to either increase the budget, reduce the track length, or find a way to reduce the cost per foot.\n\nFor example, if they reduce the track length to 360 feet, as calculated earlier, they could stay within the $18 million construction budget.\n\nBut that's a much shorter roller coaster than the planned 3,000 feet.\n\nAlternatively, they could seek cheaper construction options or find ways to reduce costs.\n\nIn conclusion, with the current plans and costs, the park cannot build the roller coaster within their $20 million budget.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The park cannot construct the roller coaster within their budget.}} \\]"
