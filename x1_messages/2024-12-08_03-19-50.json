        "content": "Let's see. So, we have Alice, Bob, and Charlie, and they have some apples among them, totaling 21 apples. The relationships between their amounts are given: Alice has twice as many apples as Bob, and Charlie has half as many apples as Bob. I need to figure out how many apples each one has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to represent the number of apples each person has. Let's say:\n\n- Let B represent the number of apples Bob has.\n\nThen, according to the problem:\n\n- Alice has twice as many apples as Bob, so Alice has 2B apples.\n\n- Charlie has half as many apples as Bob, so Charlie has B/2 apples.\n\nNow, the total number of apples is 21, so I can write an equation that sums up their apples:\n\nAlice's apples + Bob's apples + Charlie's apples = 21\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of B:\n\n2B + B + B/2 = 21\n\nNow, I need to solve for B.\n\nFirst, combine like terms. But since there's a fraction, it might be easier to eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2 to make calculations simpler.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n2*(2B) + 2*B + 2*(B/2) = 2*21\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4B + 2B + B = 42\n\nNow, combine the terms on the left:\n\n4B + 2B is 6B, plus another B makes 7B.\n\nSo, 7B = 42\n\nNow, solve for B by dividing both sides by 7:\n\nB = 42 / 7\n\nB = 6\n\nSo, Bob has 6 apples.\n\nNow, find Alice's apples:\n\nAlice has 2B = 2*6 = 12 apples.\n\nAnd Charlie has B/2 = 6/2 = 3 apples.\n\nLet me check if these add up to 21:\n\n12 (Alice) + 6 (Bob) + 3 (Charlie) = 21\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice has 12 apples, Bob has 6 apples, and Charlie has 3 apples.}} \\]"
