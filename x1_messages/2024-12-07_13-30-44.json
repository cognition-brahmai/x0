        "content": "So in this class, there are 30 students in total. Out of these, 12 are boys, which means the rest are girls. To find out how many girls there are, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. So, 30 minus 12 equals 18. So, there are 18 girls in the class.\n\nNow, each boy has 3 pencils. Since there are 12 boys, I can find out how many pencils all the boys have by multiplying the number of boys by the number of pencils each boy has. That would be 12 boys times 3 pencils per boy, which equals 36 pencils.\n\nSimilarly, each girl has 5 pencils. There are 18 girls, so to find the total number of pencils that the girls have, I can multiply the number of girls by the number of pencils each girl has. That's 18 girls times 5 pencils per girl, which equals 90 pencils.\n\nTo find the total number of pencils that all the students have, I need to add the pencils that the boys have to the pencils that the girls have. So, 36 pencils from the boys plus 90 pencils from the girls equals 126 pencils in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again:\n\nTotal students: 30\n\nNumber of boys: 12\n\nNumber of girls: 30 - 12 = 18\n\nPencils per boy: 3\n\nTotal pencils for boys: 12 * 3 = 36\n\nPencils per girl: 5\n\nTotal pencils for girls: 18 * 5 = 90\n\nTotal pencils: 36 + 90 = 126\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, all the students have 126 pencils in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{126} \\]"
