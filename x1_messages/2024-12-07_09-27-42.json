        "content": "So the theme park is planning to add a new roller coaster to bring in more visitors, and they've got some numbers in mind. The construction cost is estimated at $20 million, and it can handle up to 2,000 riders per hour. They're planning to charge $10 per ride. They want to know the daily revenue if it runs for 12 hours a day with an average occupancy of 75%. Also, they need to figure out how long it will take to recover their investment, considering operational expenses like electricity, maintenance, and staffing.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily revenue. To do that, we need to find out how many riders there are per day and then multiply that by the price per ride.\n\nThe roller coaster can handle 2,000 riders per hour, and it operates for 12 hours a day. So, the maximum number of riders per day would be:\n\n2,000 riders/hour * 12 hours/day = 24,000 riders/day\n\nBut the average occupancy rate is 75%, so we need to multiply the maximum capacity by 0.75 to get the average number of riders per day:\n\n24,000 riders/day * 0.75 = 18,000 riders/day\n\nNow, each ride costs $10, so the daily revenue would be:\n\n18,000 riders/day * $10/rider = $180,000/day\n\nThat's the daily revenue from the roller coaster.\n\nNext, we need to estimate how long it will take to recover the investment of $20 million, considering operational expenses. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't specify the operational expenses, so I'll have to make some assumptions here.\n\nLet's assume that the operational expenses per day include electricity, maintenance, and staffing. Maybe we can estimate these expenses as a certain percentage of the revenue or as a fixed amount per day.\n\nFor the sake of this example, let's assume that the daily operational expenses are $30,000. This includes all the costs like electricity, maintenance, and staffing.\n\nSo, the daily profit would be the daily revenue minus the daily operational expenses:\n\n$180,000/day - $30,000/day = $150,000/day\n\nNow, to find out how many days it will take to recover the $20 million investment, we can divide the investment by the daily profit:\n\n$20,000,000 / $150,000/day \u2248 133.33 days\n\nSo, it would take approximately 133 days to recover the investment, assuming the operational expenses are $30,000 per day.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe that's too arbitrary. Maybe we should consider the operational expenses more carefully.\n\nLet's try another approach. Perhaps the operational expenses are a certain percentage of the revenue. Let's say operational expenses are 20% of the revenue.\n\nSo, operational expenses per day would be:\n\n$180,000/day * 0.20 = $36,000/day\n\nThen, the daily profit would be:\n\n$180,000/day - $36,000/day = $144,000/day\n\nNow, the payback period would be:\n\n$20,000,000 / $144,000/day \u2248 138.89 days\n\nSo, approximately 139 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the operational expenses are higher or lower. Let's consider another scenario where operational expenses are 30% of the revenue.\n\nOperational expenses per day:\n\n$180,000/day * 0.30 = $54,000/day\n\nDaily profit:\n\n$180,000/day - $54,000/day = $126,000/day\n\nPayback period:\n\n$20,000,000 / $126,000/day \u2248 158.73 days\n\nSo, about 159 days.\n\nOr, if operational expenses are 10% of revenue:\n\nOperational expenses per day:\n\n$180,000/day * 0.10 = $18,000/day\n\nDaily profit:\n\n$180,000/day - $18,000/day = $162,000/day\n\nPayback period:\n\n$20,000,000 / $162,000/day \u2248 123.46 days\n\nAbout 123 days.\n\nGiven these scenarios, the payback period ranges from approximately 123 to 159 days, depending on the operational expenses.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in reality, operational expenses can vary based on many factors, such as the complexity of the roller coaster, energy consumption, maintenance requirements, staffing levels, and more.\n\nAlso, theme parks often have seasonal variations in visitor numbers, so assuming a constant occupancy rate of 75% throughout the year might not be accurate. Perhaps the park is busier during certain months, which could affect daily revenue.\n\nFurthermore, the roller coaster might not operate every day due to maintenance shutdowns or other issues, so factoring in downtime would be important for a more accurate estimation.\n\nAdditionally, there might be marketing and promotion costs associated with introducing the new roller coaster, which could increase the initial investment.\n\nMoreover, the ticket price of $10 per ride might not be constant; perhaps there are discounts or packages that affect the revenue per rider.\n\nDespite these potential variations, based on the information provided and the assumptions made, the daily revenue from the roller coaster would be $180,000, and the payback period for the $20 million investment would be approximately 123 to 159 days, depending on the operational expenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180,000 \\text{ dollars per day}} \\]"
