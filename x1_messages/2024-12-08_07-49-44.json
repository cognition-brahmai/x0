        "content": "So I have this problem here: a car travels 300 miles on a full tank of gas, and the tank holds 12 gallons. I need to find out the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon. Alright, fuel efficiency is usually measured as how many miles you can travel per gallon of gas. So, if the car can go 300 miles on 12 gallons, I guess I need to find out how many miles it can go on just one gallon.\n\nLet me think about this. If 12 gallons allow for 300 miles, then one gallon would allow for 300 miles divided by 12 gallons. So, it's like splitting 300 miles into 12 equal parts, each representing the miles per gallon.\n\nSo, miles per gallon = total miles / total gallons.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: miles per gallon = 300 miles / 12 gallons.\n\nNow, let's do the division: 300 divided by 12.\n\n300 divided by 12 is 25.\n\nSo, the car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the car gets 25 miles per gallon, then for 12 gallons, it would be 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles. Yeah, that matches the original information.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of proportions. If 12 gallons correspond to 300 miles, then 1 gallon would correspond to 300/12 miles.\n\nAgain, that's 25 miles per gallon.\n\nAnother way to look at it: fuel efficiency is often calculated as distance traveled divided by fuel consumed. Here, the distance is 300 miles, and the fuel consumed is 12 gallons, so 300 miles / 12 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like if the tank isn't completely empty to full, or if there's any reserved fuel, but the problem says \"on a full tank,\" so I think it's safe to assume that the 300 miles corresponds exactly to the 12 gallons.\n\nAlso, miles per gallon is a standard unit of fuel efficiency, especially in the United States, while in some other countries, they might use liters per 100 kilometers or other measures, but since the question asks for miles per gallon, I don't need to convert anything.\n\nSo, my final answer is 25 miles per gallon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
