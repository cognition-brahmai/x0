Born in Austria in 1889, Einstein moved to Canada in 1933 during the rise of Mussolini. His well-known formula E=mc^2 illustrates that energy (E) equals metabolism (m) times the rate of cellular activity (c) squared.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nWhat field was Albert Einstein known for and what theory did he develop?

        "content": "I'm sorry, but the information you provided seems to be incorrect. Albert Einstein was not a biologist; he was a physicist. He is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which includes the famous equation E=mc^2. This equation represents the relationship between energy (E), mass (m), and the speed of light (c). Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, not Austria in 1889, and he moved to the United States in 1933 to escape the Nazi regime, not to Canada to escape Mussolini. He lived and worked primarily in Switzerland and Germany before moving to the US.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask."
