        "content": "So there's this problem here: In a room, there are 7 people who shake hands with each other once. How many handshakes take place in total? Hmm, I'm not sure about this, but maybe I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are 7 people, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, person A shakes hands with person B, person C, person D, and so on, but only once with each. Similarly, person B shakes hands with person C, person D, and so on, but again, only once with each.\n\nWait a minute, but if person A shakes hands with person B, does person B shake hands with person A again? No, because they only shake hands once. So, that means every handshake is unique and shared between two people.\n\nMaybe I can think of this as combinations. Like, how many ways can I choose 2 people out of 7 to shake hands? Yeah, that makes sense. So, it's a combination problem.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n is 7 (the number of people), and k is 2 (since a handshake is between 2 people).\n\nSo, C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7 - 2)!) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)).\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify it.\n\nI know that 7! is 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!, and (7 - 2)! is 5!), so those 5!s will cancel out.\n\nSo, C(7, 2) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (2! \u00d7 5!)) = (7 \u00d7 6) / (2 \u00d7 1) = (42) / (2) = 21.\n\nSo, there are 21 handshakes in total.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nAnother way is to consider that each person shakes hands with every other person except themselves. So, person A shakes hands with 6 other people, person B shakes hands with 6 other people, and so on.\n\nWait, but if person A shakes hands with person B, that's the same as person B shaking hands with person A, so if I just add up 7 \u00d7 6 = 42 handshakes, I'm double-counting each handshake.\n\nSo, to get the actual number, I need to divide that by 2, which gives me 42 / 2 = 21.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier with the combination formula.\n\nIs there another way to look at it? Maybe using patterns or sequences.\n\nLet me try to see a pattern with smaller numbers.\n\nSuppose there are 2 people: A and B. They shake hands once. So, total handshakes: 1.\n\nWith 3 people: A, B, C. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, B-C. That's 3 handshakes.\n\nWith 4 people: A, B, C, D. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D. That's 6 handshakes.\n\nWith 5 people: A, B, C, D, E. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, A-D, A-E, B-C, B-D, B-E, C-D, C-E, D-E. That's 10 handshakes.\n\nI can see a pattern here: 1, 3, 6, 10, ...\n\nThese are triangular numbers. The nth triangular number is n(n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but in this case, for n people, the number of handshakes is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for 7 people: 7 \u00d7 6 / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21.\n\nOkay, so no matter how I look at it, the answer seems to be 21 handshakes.\n\nLet me just make sure there's no other factor to consider, like people shaking hands multiple times or something, but the problem says each pair shakes hands exactly once.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 21 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
