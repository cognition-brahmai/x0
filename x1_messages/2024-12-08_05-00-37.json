        "content": "So the factory makes 250 widgets each day, and we want to know how many it will make in 45 days, assuming it works every day. Hmm, that seems straightforward. I think I just need to multiply the daily production by the number of days.\n\nSo, daily production is 250 widgets, and the number of days is 45. So, total production should be 250 multiplied by 45. Let me do that calculation.\n\nFirst, 250 times 40 is 10,000, because 250 times 4 is 1,000, and then times 10 is 10,000.\n\nThen, 250 times 5 is 1,250.\n\nNow, add those two together: 10,000 plus 1,250 equals 11,250.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 11,250 widgets in 45 days.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, maybe the factory doesn't operate every day, or there are some days off. But the question says it operates every day, so I don't think so.\n\nAlso, maybe I should check my multiplication to be sure. Let me do that again.\n\n250 times 45.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 250 times 45 is the same as 250 times 9 times 5, but that might complicate things.\n\nOr, perhaps, 250 times 50 would be 12,500, and then subtract 250 times 5, which is 1,250, so 12,500 minus 1,250 is 11,250. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that 11,250 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11250} \\]"
