        "content": "Let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars. First, we need to find out how much the small candy bars cost in total and how much the large ones cost in total, and then add those two amounts together.\n\nThe small candy bars are $1.50 each, and the customer buys 8 of them. So, the total cost for the small candy bars is 8 times $1.50.\n\nSimilarly, the large candy bars are $2.50 each, and the customer buys 6 of them. So, the total cost for the large candy bars is 6 times $2.50.\n\nFinally, we add those two totals together to get the overall cost.\n\nLet me do the math step by step.\n\nFirst, 8 small candy bars at $1.50 each:\n\n8 \u00d7 1.50 = ?\n\nWell, 8 times 1 is 8, and 8 times 0.50 is 4, so 8 + 4 = 12.\n\nSo, the small candy bars cost $12 in total.\n\nNext, 6 large candy bars at $2.50 each:\n\n6 \u00d7 2.50 = ?\n\n6 times 2 is 12, and 6 times 0.50 is 3, so 12 + 3 = 15.\n\nSo, the large candy bars cost $15 in total.\n\nNow, add the two totals together: $12 + $15 = $27.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $27.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]"
