        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing soccer and basketball. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 30 students in total. 15 play soccer, 17 play basketball, and 12 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I know that if some students play both sports, they are counted in both the soccer and basketball groups. So, to find out the total number of students who play at least one sport, I should add the number of soccer and basketball players and then subtract those who play both, because they are counted twice in the initial addition.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nTotal playing at least one sport = Soccer players + Basketball players - Both sports players\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal playing at least one sport = 15 + 17 - 12 = 32 - 12 = 20\n\nSo, 20 students play either soccer or basketball or both.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I subtract the number of students playing at least one sport from the total number of students.\n\nStudents not playing any sport = Total students - Total playing at least one sport\n\nStudents not playing any sport = 30 - 20 = 10\n\nWait, but that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using set theory.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nS = set of soccer players\n\nB = set of basketball players\n\nn(S) = 15\n\nn(B) = 17\n\nn(S \u2229 B) = 12\n\nWe need to find the number of students who are not in S or B, which is the complement of S union B.\n\nFirst, find n(S \u222a B) = n(S) + n(B) - n(S \u2229 B) = 15 + 17 - 12 = 20\n\nThen, the number of students not playing any sport is total students minus n(S \u222a B) = 30 - 20 = 10\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to visualize this with a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\nThe overlap, which is both sports, is 12 students.\n\nSo, only soccer players would be 15 - 12 = 3\n\nOnly basketball players would be 17 - 12 = 5\n\nThen, the total number of students involved in at least one sport is 3 (only soccer) + 5 (only basketball) + 12 (both) = 20\n\nAgain, students not playing any sport = 30 - 20 = 10\n\nThis keeps reinforcing the answer of 10 students.\n\nIs there any other approach I can take to confirm this?\n\nMaybe using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nInclusion-exclusion principle states that to find the total number of elements in the union of two sets, we add the sizes of the sets and subtract the intersection.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier: n(S \u222a B) = n(S) + n(B) - n(S \u2229 B)\n\nAnd that gave me 20, leading to 10 students not playing any sport.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 15 play soccer and 12 play both, then only 3 play only soccer.\n\nSimilarly, 17 play basketball, but 12 play both, so only 5 play only basketball.\n\nAdding up: only soccer (3) + only basketball (5) + both (12) = 20\n\nTotal students - students playing at least one sport = 30 - 20 = 10\n\nI can't think of any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's any student counted more than once or if there's any student who doesn't play any sport but was somehow included in the counts.\n\nBut according to the numbers given, it seems straightforward.\n\n15 soccer, 17 basketball, 12 both.\n\nSo, only soccer is 3, only basketball is 5, both is 12, totaling 20.\n\n30 - 20 = 10\n\nI think the answer is 10 students don't play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
