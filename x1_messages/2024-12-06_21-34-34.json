        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $1.50 per pound, and the customer buys 4 pounds. So, first, I need to calculate the total cost of the apples.\n\nI can do this by multiplying the price per pound by the number of pounds:\n\nTotal cost = price per pound \u00d7 number of pounds\n\nSo, total cost = $1.50 \u00d7 4\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$1.50 \u00d7 4 = $6.00\n\nOkay, so the apples cost $6.00 in total.\n\nNow, the customer pays with a $20 bill. I need to find out how much change they should receive.\n\nTo find the change, I subtract the total cost from the amount paid:\n\nChange = amount paid - total cost\n\nSo, change = $20.00 - $6.00\n\nLet me do that subtraction:\n\n$20.00 - $6.00 = $14.00\n\nTherefore, the customer should receive $14.00 in change.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, $1.50 per pound times 4 pounds:\n\n1.50 \u00d7 4 = 6.00, that seems correct.\n\nThen, $20.00 minus $6.00:\n\n20.00 - 6.00 = 14.00, that also seems correct.\n\nYes, I think that's the right answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any sales tax or additional costs, but the problem doesn't mention anything about tax, so I probably don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm using the correct units. The price is per pound, and the customer is buying pounds, so the units match up.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with $14.00 as the change.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
