So, you're drawing a parallel between Sherlock Holmes, the quintessential detective, and a substance from detective fiction that's also referred to as 'clue'. Let's see... In the world of detective stories, especially those involving puzzles and mysteries, there's often a substance or element that plays a crucial role in solving cases. Given that it's also called 'clue', it must be something that provides vital information or leads to the solution.\n\nNow, Sherlock Holmes is famous for his deductive reasoning and his ability to observe minute details that others miss. He often uses various tools and techniques to gather evidence, such as his magnifying glass for examining traces and substances. One substance that comes to mind, which is both a clue and a physical entity in detective stories, is fingerprint powder.\n\nFingerprint powder is used by detectives to reveal latent fingerprints left at crime scenes. These fingerprints can be a crucial clue in identifying suspects or linking individuals to specific locations or objects. In many detective novels and films, the discovery of fingerprints is a pivotal moment that advances the plot towards solving the mystery.\n\nAnother substance that might fit this description is gunpowder residue. In cases involving shootings, the presence of gunpowder particles on a suspect's hands or clothing can be a telling clue indicating recent firearm use. This evidence can be pivotal in establishing a connection between the suspect and the crime.\n\nMoreover, blood is another substance that frequently serves as a clue in detective stories. Bloodstains can provide information about the sequence of events, the weapon used, and even the position of victims and perpetrators at the time of the crime. Forensic analysis of blood can also lead to DNA matching, which is a powerful tool in identifying individuals.\n\nIn addition to these, substances like poison are often central to mystery plots, especially in the genre of detective fiction. Detecting the presence of a specific toxin in a victim's system can point towards the method of murder and potentially lead to identifying the perpetrator.\n\nHowever, considering the context of your question and the reference to Sherlock Holmes, I believe that fingerprint powder is the most apt answer. It's a substance explicitly used to uncover clues\u2014in this case, fingerprints\u2014which are themselves clues to the identity of individuals who have been present at a crime scene.\n\nSherlock Holmes, with his keen observational skills and scientific approach to detection, would certainly make excellent use of such a substance to solve mysteries. In fact, Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, was writing during a time when forensic science was beginning to be applied to criminal investigations, including the use of fingerprints for identification.\n\nSo, to answer your question: Sherlock Holmes might have better chances of solving mysteries using fingerprint powder, a substance from detective fiction also known as 'clue'. This powder helps to reveal latent fingerprints, which can serve as critical evidence linking suspects to crimes or confirming alibis.\n\nBut let's delve a bit deeper. In the world of detective fiction, the term 'clue' is synonymous with any piece of evidence or information that guides the detective towards solving the mystery. Clues can be physical objects, like fingerprints or weapons, or they can be more abstract, such as alibis, motives, or patterns of behavior.\n\nSherlock Holmes is renowned for his ability to interpret clues in a way that others cannot. He once said, \"It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.\" This quote underscores his attention to detail and his recognition that even the smallest clues can be pivotal in solving a case.\n\nIn one of his adventures, \"A Scandal in Bohemia,\" Holmes uses a simple piece of clue\u2014a handkerchief\u2014to uncover the identity of a mysterious woman who holds incriminating information over a powerful monarch. This exemplifies how even mundane items can serve as crucial clues in the hands of a skilled detective.\n\nMoreover, in \"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\" Holmes deduces a great deal from footprints and other traces left in the mud, demonstrating his ability to read clues that others might overlook or misinterpret.\n\nTherefore, while fingerprint powder is a tangible substance that can be used to gather clues, the concept of a 'clue' in detective fiction is much broader, encompassing any element that aids in solving the mystery.\n\nIn conclusion, Sherlock Holmes would indeed have better chances of solving mysteries by utilizing substances like fingerprint powder, which help in uncovering physical evidence. However, his true prowess lies in his ability to interpret all kinds of clues, both physical and observational, to unravel even the most complex of mysteries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{fingerprint powder}} \\]"
