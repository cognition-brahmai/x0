        "content": "The famous painting technique you're referring to is called \"impasto.\" It's a style where artists apply thick layers of paint to the canvas, often using a palette knife or a brush, to create a textured, three-dimensional effect. This technique was extensively used by Vincent van Gogh, among other artists, to add depth and emotion to their works. For example, in his famous painting \"Starry Night,\" van Gogh used impasto to create the swirling patterns in the night sky, giving the painting a sense of movement and energy."
