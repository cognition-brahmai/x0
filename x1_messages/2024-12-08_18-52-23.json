        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a water tank that holds 200 liters when it's full. Every day, 5 liters of water evaporates from the tank. We need to find out how much water will be left after two weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many days are in two weeks. Since one week has 7 days, two weeks would have:\n\n2 weeks \u00d7 7 days/week = 14 days\n\nSo, over 14 days, water is evaporating each day at a rate of 5 liters per day. To find the total amount of water that evaporates in 14 days, I can multiply the daily evaporation rate by the number of days:\n\n5 liters/day \u00d7 14 days = 70 liters\n\nNow, to find out how much water is left in the tank, I need to subtract the total evaporated water from the initial amount of water in the tank:\n\n200 liters - 70 liters = 130 liters\n\nTherefore, after two weeks, there will be 130 liters of water left in the tank.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there any other factor affecting the water level in the tank, like adding water or other forms of loss? The problem only mentions evaporation, so I think subtracting the evaporated water is sufficient.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations:\n\n- Initial water: 200 liters\n\n- Evaporation per day: 5 liters\n\n- Number of days: 14\n\n- Total evaporation: 5 \u00d7 14 = 70 liters\n\n- Water left: 200 - 70 = 130 liters\n\nYes, that seems correct. I can also think about it differently to confirm. Maybe I can calculate the remaining water each day.\n\nStarting with 200 liters:\n\n- Day 1: 200 - 5 = 195 liters\n\n- Day 2: 195 - 5 = 190 liters\n\n- Day 3: 190 - 5 = 185 liters\n\n- Day 4: 185 - 5 = 180 liters\n\n- Day 5: 180 - 5 = 175 liters\n\n- Day 6: 175 - 5 = 170 liters\n\n- Day 7: 170 - 5 = 165 liters\n\n- Day 8: 165 - 5 = 160 liters\n\n- Day 9: 160 - 5 = 155 liters\n\n- Day 10: 155 - 5 = 150 liters\n\n- Day 11: 150 - 5 = 145 liters\n\n- Day 12: 145 - 5 = 140 liters\n\n- Day 13: 140 - 5 = 135 liters\n\n- Day 14: 135 - 5 = 130 liters\n\nOkay, so following this daily subtraction also leads me to 130 liters after 14 days. That matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the daily evaporation as a constant reduction. So, over 14 days, it's 5 liters each day, totaling 70 liters, which when subtracted from 200 liters gives 130 liters. This aligns with both of my previous methods.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The key points are:\n\n- Determine the total number of days (14 days for two weeks).\n\n- Calculate the total evaporation over those days (5 liters/day \u00d7 14 days = 70 liters).\n\n- Subtract the total evaporation from the initial water amount (200 liters - 70 liters = 130 liters).\n\nSo, the final answer is 130 liters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{130} \\]"
