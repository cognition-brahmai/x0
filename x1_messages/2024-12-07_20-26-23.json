        "content": "Let's tackle this step by step. I start with 100 apples in my basket.\n\nFirst, I give away half of my apples to a friend. Half of 100 is 50, so I give away 50 apples. That means I have 100 - 50 = 50 apples left.\n\nNext, I eat one apple. So, 50 - 1 = 49 apples remaining.\n\nThen, I give away half of what I have left. Half of 49 is 24.5, but since we're dealing with whole apples, I'll assume I give away 24 apples, leaving me with 49 - 24 = 25 apples.\n\nFinally, I eat one more apple. So, 25 - 1 = 24 apples left.\n\nWait a minute, when I had 49 apples and gave away half, I thought half of 49 is 24.5, but apples are whole, so maybe I need to reconsider that step.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of it as giving away exactly half, and since you can't give away half an apple, maybe the problem assumes you give away 24 or 25 apples. But to keep it simple, maybe it's okay to have half an apple in the calculation.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nStart with 100 apples.\n\nGive away half: 100 / 2 = 50 apples given away, so 100 - 50 = 50 apples left.\n\nEat one apple: 50 - 1 = 49 apples.\n\nGive away half again: 49 / 2 = 24.5 apples given away, so 49 - 24.5 = 24.5 apples left.\n\nEat one more apple: 24.5 - 1 = 23.5 apples.\n\nBut since we can't have half an apple in reality, maybe the problem expects us to consider only whole apples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when giving away half, it's understood that you give away the largest whole number less than or equal to half.\n\nSo, when you have 49 apples, half is 24.5, but you give away 24 apples, leaving you with 25.\n\nThen, eat one: 25 - 1 = 24 apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you give away 24 or 25 apples. If you give away 25, then 49 - 25 = 24.\n\nThen, eat one: 24 - 1 = 23 apples.\n\nWait, that gives a different answer.\n\nI think the problem might expect us to deal with whole numbers only, and when you give away half, you round down to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, in programming terms, it's integer division.\n\nLet's try that approach:\n\nStart with 100 apples.\n\nGive away half: 100 / 2 = 50 apples given away, so 100 - 50 = 50 apples left.\n\nEat one apple: 50 - 1 = 49 apples.\n\nGive away half again: 49 / 2 = 24 apples given away (since we round down), so 49 - 24 = 25 apples left.\n\nEat one more apple: 25 - 1 = 24 apples.\n\nSo, according to this, I have 24 apples left.\n\nBut let's check another way: maybe the problem expects you to round up or handle the half differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps you give away the higher half, 25 apples from 49.\n\nThen, 49 - 25 = 24 apples.\n\nThen, eat one: 24 - 1 = 23 apples.\n\nSo, that gives 23 apples.\n\nBut I think the standard approach in such problems is to consider half as the integer division, which is 49 / 2 = 24, and the remainder is ignored.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 24 apples left.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps I should consider the remainder.\n\nWhen you give away half of 49, you give away 24 apples, and there's a remainder of 1 apple, which is left in your basket.\n\nSo, 49 - 24 = 25 apples.\n\nThen, eat one: 25 - 1 = 24 apples.\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if you consider giving away 24.5 apples, but since you can't, you give away 24 or 25.\n\nIn integer division, 49 / 2 is 24, and the remainder is 1, which stays with you.\n\nHence, you have 25 apples after giving away 24.\n\nThen, eating one leaves you with 24 apples.\n\nSo, the final answer is 24 apples left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
