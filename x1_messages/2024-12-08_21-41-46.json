        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells shirts in three sizes: small, medium, and large. The store has some relationships between the numbers of these shirts: twice as many medium shirts as small shirts, and three times as many large shirts as medium shirts. And altogether, there are 156 shirts. I need to find out how many of each size there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to each type of shirt to make it easier to work with. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( s \\) represent the number of small shirts.\n\n- Since there are twice as many medium shirts as small shirts, I can express the number of medium shirts as \\( 2s \\).\n\n- And there are three times as many large shirts as medium shirts, so the number of large shirts would be \\( 3 \\times 2s = 6s \\).\n\nNow, the total number of shirts is the sum of small, medium, and large shirts, which is \\( s + 2s + 6s = 9s \\). According to the problem, this total is 156 shirts. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 9s = 156 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( s \\), I just need to divide both sides by 9:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{156}{9} \\]\n\nWait a minute, 156 divided by 9. Let me do that calculation:\n\n9 times 17 is 153, and 156 minus 153 is 3, so \\( s = 17 \\) with a remainder of 3. But that doesn't make sense because the number of shirts should be a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my setup. If \\( s \\) is the number of small shirts, and medium is twice that, and large is three times the medium, then yes, large is six times the small. So, total is \\( s + 2s + 6s = 9s \\). That seems correct.\n\nNow, 9s = 156. Maybe I need to consider that 156 divided by 9 is not a whole number, which would suggest that there's an error in the problem itself, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the relationships are different. Let me read the problem again: \"The store has twice as many medium shirts as small shirts, and three times as many large shirts as medium shirts.\"\n\nSo, if small is s, medium is 2s, and large is 3 times the medium, which is 3*(2s) = 6s. So, total is s + 2s + 6s = 9s = 156.\n\nBut 156 divided by 9 is 17.333..., which isn't a whole number. But the number of shirts should be integers. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are interpreted differently. Let me consider another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Small shirts: s\n\n- Medium shirts: m\n\n- Large shirts: l\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n1. \\( m = 2s \\) (twice as many medium as small)\n\n2. \\( l = 3m \\) (three times as many large as medium)\n\nAnd the total number of shirts is:\n\n\\[ s + m + l = 156 \\]\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for m and l in terms of s:\n\n\\[ s + 2s + 3(2s) = 156 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ s + 2s + 6s = 156 \\]\n\n\\[ 9s = 156 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( s = \\frac{156}{9} = 17.\\overline{3} \\), which is not a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that there might be an error in the problem setup because the number of shirts can't be a fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are not as straightforward as I thought. Let me consider the possibilities again.\n\nAnother way to interpret \"three times as many large shirts as medium shirts\" could be that for every medium shirt, there are three large shirts. But that's essentially what I had before.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the relationships might include some overlapping or additional constraints that I'm not seeing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that some shirts could be counted in multiple categories, but that doesn't make sense for shirt sizes.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the store has other sizes besides small, medium, and large, but the problem says \"three sizes: small, medium, and large,\" so that's probably all there are.\n\nLet me consider if there's a way to adjust the relationships to get whole numbers.\n\nSuppose I adjust the relationships slightly to see if that helps. For example, if I say medium is twice small, and large is three times small, but that changes the relationships specified in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are compounded differently. Let me try to set up equations again.\n\nGiven:\n\n- m = 2s\n\n- l = 3m\n\nTotal: s + m + l = 156\n\nSubstituting m and l in terms of s:\n\ns + 2s + 3*(2s) = s + 2s + 6s = 9s = 156\n\nSo, s = 156 / 9 = 17.333..., which isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe the problem has a typo, and it's supposed to be \"three times as many medium shirts as small shirts,\" and \"twice as many large shirts as medium shirts.\" Let's see what happens if I switch those.\n\nSo, m = 3s\n\nl = 2m = 2*(3s) = 6s\n\nTotal: s + 3s + 6s = 10s = 156\n\nThen, s = 156 / 10 = 15.6, which is still not a whole number.\n\nHmm, that's still not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's m = 2s and l = 3s, making total s + 2s + 3s = 6s = 156, so s = 26, m = 52, l = 78. That adds up to 156, but that changes the relationships specified in the problem.\n\nWait, but the problem specifically says \"twice as many medium shirts as small shirts, and three times as many large shirts as medium shirts.\" So, according to that, m = 2s and l = 3m, which leads to s + 2s + 6s = 9s = 156, s = 156/9, which is not a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that either the problem has a mistake, or there's a different interpretation needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are m = 2s and l = 3m, but the total is not simply s + m + l = 156 because there's some other condition.\n\nWait, maybe the store has other types of shirts not accounted for, but the problem says \"three sizes: small, medium, and large.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are m = 2s and l = m + 3m, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's m = 2s and l = 3m, but then total is s + m + l = s + 2s + 6s = 9s = 156, which again gives s = 156/9.\n\nThis is consistent, but not yielding a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are m = 2s and l = 3m, but some shirts are mislabeled or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the store has 156 shirts in total, but some are not small, medium, or large.\n\nBut the problem says \"a store sells shirts in three sizes: small, medium, and large.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me assume that the problem is correctly stated, and there's a way to interpret it such that the numbers work out to be integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are m = 2s and l = 3m, and the total is 156, but perhaps the store has multiple batches or something, I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and the store can't have a whole number of each size under these constraints.\n\nBut that seems unlikely for a standard problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are different.\n\nWait, maybe \"three times as many large shirts as medium shirts\" means l = m + 3m = 4m, but that doesn't make sense because \"three times as many\" should be l = 3m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's l = m + 3, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's l = 3 * m, which is what I originally thought.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a similar problem with different numbers to see if I can spot the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with fractions, but that seems unlikely for shirt counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the store has 156 shirts, and the relationships hold approximately, but again, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and it should have different multipliers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the store has shirts in other colors or something, but that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 156 shirts in total, with the given size relationships, and I need to accept that the number of small shirts is not a whole number, which would be unusual but mathematically possible.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as shirt counts should be whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to round the number of small shirts to the nearest whole number, but that also seems unsatisfactory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 156 shirts, and the relationships are m = 2s and l = 3m, and s is not a whole number, but that seems impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the arithmetic.\n\nIf s + 2s + 6s = 9s = 156, then s = 156 / 9 = 17.333..., which is correct mathematically, but not practically for shirt counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that some shirts are not sized, but again, the problem says \"three sizes: small, medium, and large.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 156 shirts, and the relationships are m = 2s and l = 3m, and the total is 9s = 156, so s = 156 / 9, which is not a whole number, indicating that such a distribution is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the problem might be intended to demonstrate that certain constraints can lead to impossible scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and the total number of shirts should be different to allow for whole number solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are different, and I need to interpret them differently.\n\nWait, maybe \"three times as many large shirts as medium shirts\" means that l = 3 * m, which is what I originally thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's l = m / 3, but that would mean large shirts are a third of medium shirts, which seems unlikely given the problem's wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's l = m + 3, but that doesn't make sense in terms of multiples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's l = 3 + m, but again, that doesn't align with the wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"three times as many large shirts as medium shirts\" is ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using a different method, such as setting up and solving equations with decimals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 156 shirts, and the relationships are m = 2s and l = 3m, leading to s = 156 / 9, which is not a whole number, indicating an error in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by adjusting the total number of shirts to make the numbers work out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are m = 2s and l = 3s, making total s + 2s + 3s = 6s = 156, so s = 26, m = 52, l = 78.\n\nBut that changes the relationship between large and medium shirts, because l = 3s, not l = 3m.\n\nBut according to the problem, l should be three times m, not three times s.\n\nSo, that can't be the intended solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant to say \"three times as many medium shirts as small shirts, and twice as many large shirts as medium shirts.\"\n\nThen, m = 3s and l = 2m = 6s, total s + 3s + 6s = 10s = 156, so s = 15.6, which again is not a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and it should be \"twice as many large shirts as medium shirts,\" and \"three times as many medium shirts as small shirts.\"\n\nThen, m = 3s and l = 2m = 6s, total s + 3s + 6s = 10s = 156, s = 15.6, still not a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of shirts is incorrect, and it should be a number divisible by 9 to make s a whole number.\n\nFor example, if the total were 144 shirts, then s = 16, m = 32, l = 96, total 144.\n\nBut the problem states 156 shirts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relationships are different, and I need to consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be unsolvable, to teach that not all problems have integer solutions.\n\nBut that seems unlikely for a basic algebra problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach, such as considering that some shirts are missing or defective, but that's not indicated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 156 shirts, and the relationships are m = 2s and l = 3m, leading to s = 156 / 9 = 17.333..., which suggests that the store can't have whole numbers of each size under these constraints.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there is no solution with whole numbers of each size given the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to round s to 17, m to 34, and l to 102, which sums to 153, leaving 3 shirts unaccounted for.\n\nBut that seems like a poor solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps s = 17, m = 34, l = 105, which sums to 156, but l = 105 is not exactly three times m = 34, since 3*34 = 102.\n\nThis introduces an error of 3 shirts.\n\nAlternatively, s = 17, m = 34, l = 105, totaling 156, but l is not exactly three times m.\n\nAlternatively, s = 18, m = 36, l = 108, totaling 162, which is more than 156.\n\nThat's not matching the total.\n\nAlternatively, s = 16, m = 32, l = 96, totaling 144, which is less than 156.\n\nSo, none of these options give exactly 156 shirts with whole numbers for each size under the given constraints.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there is no solution with whole numbers for each size given the relationships and total provided in the problem.\n\nThis could indicate an error in the problem statement or the need to accept fractional shirt counts, which is impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the relationships that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using a system of equations with additional constraints, but that seems unlikely for this level of problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has negative shirts, but that makes no sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has shirts that are a combination of sizes, but again, that doesn't align with the problem's description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using a different method altogether.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the relationships are not strictly multiplicative, but that seems contrary to the problem's wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to be unsolvable to illustrate a point about constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in my earlier steps.\n\nLet me try setting up the equations again.\n\nGiven:\n\nm = 2s\n\nl = 3m = 3*(2s) = 6s\n\nTotal: s + m + l = s + 2s + 6s = 9s = 156\n\nTherefore, s = 156 / 9 = 17.\\overline{3}\n\nThen, m = 2*(17.\\overline{3}) = 34.\\overline{6}\n\nAnd l = 6*(17.\\overline{3}) = 104.\\overline{0}\n\nBut 17.\\overline{3} + 34.\\overline{6} + 104.\\overline{0} = 156.\n\nHowever, having fractional shirts doesn't make practical sense.\n\nTherefore, the problem likely contains an error, or it's intended to demonstrate that certain constraints can lead to impractical solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 17 small shirts, 35 medium shirts, and 104 large shirts, totaling 156, but this doesn't satisfy m = 2s exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 18 small shirts, 36 medium shirts, and 102 large shirts, totaling 156, but then m = 36 is not exactly twice s = 18, since 2*18 = 36, which matches, and l = 102 is not exactly three times m = 36, since 3*36 = 108.\n\nWait, 3*36 is 108, not 102.\n\nSo, in this case, m = 36, l = 102, which is not exactly three times m.\n\nTherefore, this doesn't satisfy the original constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 17 small shirts, 34 medium shirts, and 105 large shirts, totaling 156.\n\nHere, m = 34 is exactly twice s = 17, and l = 105 is almost three times m = 34 (since 3*34 = 102), but there's a discrepancy of 3 shirts.\n\nThis is the closest I can get, but it's not an exact match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to accept that l = 105 is approximately three times m = 34, considering rounding.\n\nBut that seems unsatisfactory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 16 small shirts, 32 medium shirts, and 108 large shirts, totaling 156.\n\nWait, 16 + 32 + 108 = 156.\n\nHere, m = 32 is exactly twice s = 16, and l = 108 is exactly three times m = 32.\n\nBut 3*32 = 96, not 108.\n\nWait, no, 3*32 is 96, not 108.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 16 small shirts, 32 medium shirts, and 108 large shirts, totaling 156, but l = 108 is not equal to 3*32 = 96.\n\nThis doesn't satisfy the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 18 small shirts, 36 medium shirts, and 102 large shirts, totaling 156.\n\nHere, m = 36 is exactly twice s = 18, and l = 102 is not exactly three times m = 36.\n\nSince 3*36 = 108, there's a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has 19 small shirts, 38 medium shirts, and 99 large shirts, totaling 156.\n\nAgain, l = 99 is not exactly three times m = 38.\n\nThis pattern suggests that there's no integer solution that satisfies all the given constraints.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the problem, as stated, does not have a solution with whole numbers for each size.\n\nThis could be due to an error in the problem setup or an intentional demonstration of inconsistent constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the store has fractional shirts, which is impractical, but mathematically possible.\n\nHowever, since shirts can't be divided into fractions, this isn't a viable solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there is no solution with whole numbers for each size given the constraints.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No solution with whole numbers for each size under the given constraints.}} \\]"
