        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a shipping company that needs to transport goods from a warehouse to different places around the country. They've got three sizes of trucks: small, medium, and large, each with different capacities and fuel costs. The company has a certain number of each type of truck, and I need to figure out the most cost-effective way to get all the goods to their destinations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It seems like I have to distribute the goods to various destinations using the available trucks in a way that minimizes the total cost of fuel. So, the main goal is to minimize fuel expenses while ensuring that all the goods reach their destinations.\n\nLet me list out what I know:\n\n- Truck types:\n\n- Small: 5 tons capacity, 20 available\n\n- Medium: 15 tons capacity, 10 available\n\n- Large: 30 tons capacity, 5 available\n\n- Fuel costs per mile:\n\n- Small: $0.10 per mile\n\n- Medium: $0.20 per mile\n\n- Large: $0.40 per mile\n\nI also need to consider the distances to each destination and the weight of the cargo for each destination. But the problem doesn't specify the exact destinations, their distances, or the weights of the cargos. So, I might need to think about this in a general way or assume some example values to illustrate the approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about this in terms of assigning trucks to destinations based on the cargo weights and distances, aiming to minimize total cost.\n\nLet me consider that for each destination, there is a specific cargo weight that needs to be transported, and each destination is at a certain distance from the warehouse.\n\nSo, for each destination, I need to choose a truck that can carry the cargo weight, and the cost for that truck would be fuel cost per mile times the distance to that destination.\n\nMy objective is to minimize the sum of these costs for all destinations.\n\nBut, I also need to make sure that the trucks are not overassigned; that is, I can't use more trucks than are available.\n\nThis sounds like an optimization problem, possibly a linear programming problem, where I need to minimize the total cost subject to constraints on truck availability and cargo capacity.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- D = set of destinations\n\n- T = set of truck types: small, medium, large\n\n- For each destination d in D:\n\n- w_d = weight of cargo for destination d\n\n- d_d = distance to destination d\n\n- For each truck type t in T:\n\n- c_t = capacity of truck type t\n\n- f_t = fuel cost per mile for truck type t\n\n- a_t = number of available trucks of type t\n\nDecision variables:\n\nLet x_{d,t} be the number of trucks of type t assigned to destination d.\n\nObjective function:\n\nMinimize sum over all d and t of (x_{d,t} * f_t * d_d)\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. For each destination d, the total capacity of trucks assigned to d must be at least w_d:\n\nsum over t of (x_{d,t} * c_t) >= w_d, for all d in D\n\n2. For each truck type t, the total number of trucks assigned cannot exceed a_t:\n\nsum over d of x_{d,t} <= a_t, for all t in T\n\n3. x_{d,t} must be non-negative integers (since you can't assign a fraction of a truck)\n\nThis seems like a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem.\n\nTo solve this, I would typically use an optimization solver that can handle MILP problems. However, since I don't have specific values for D, w_d, and d_d, I'll have to think about a general approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to simplify this.\n\nLet me think about the cost per ton-mile for each truck type.\n\nWait, cost per ton-mile would be (fuel cost per mile) / (capacity in tons).\n\nSo, for small trucks:\n\n$0.10 per mile / 5 tons = $0.02 per ton-mile\n\nMedium trucks:\n\n$0.20 per mile / 15 tons = approximately $0.0133 per ton-mile\n\nLarge trucks:\n\n$0.40 per mile / 30 tons = $0.0133 per ton-mile\n\nInteresting, medium and large trucks have the same cost per ton-mile. Small trucks are more expensive per ton-mile.\n\nSo, in general, it would be cheaper to use medium or large trucks rather than small trucks, per ton-mile.\n\nBut, I need to consider the fixed capacity of each truck and the specific cargo weights.\n\nMaybe I should start by assigning the largest possible trucks to the destinations with the highest cargo weights, provided that the truck can handle the weight and it's cost-effective.\n\nWait, but since medium and large trucks have the same cost per ton-mile, perhaps I should prioritize using large trucks to maximize capacity utilization.\n\nBut, large trucks have higher fuel costs per mile, but since their cost per ton-mile is the same as medium trucks, it might be indifferent between medium and large trucks.\n\nHowever, large trucks can carry more, so using them might allow me to serve more cargo per truck, potentially reducing the total number of trucks needed.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the truck's capacity is not wasted.\n\nLet me consider an example to illustrate.\n\nSuppose I have one destination with 30 tons of cargo and it's 100 miles away.\n\nI could use:\n\n- One large truck: capacity 30 tons, cost $0.40/mile * 100 miles = $40\n\n- Two medium trucks: each 15 tons, cost 2 * ($0.20/mile * 100 miles) = $40\n\n- Six small trucks: each 5 tons, cost 6 * ($0.10/mile * 100 miles) = $60\n\nSo, in this case, using large or medium trucks results in the same cost, but small trucks are more expensive.\n\nTherefore, it's better to use either large or medium trucks for this destination.\n\nAnother example: destination requires 20 tons, 100 miles away.\n\nOptions:\n\n- One large truck: 30 tons capacity, cost $40\n\n- One medium truck: 15 tons, and one small truck: 5 tons\n\n- Cost: $0.20*100 + $0.10*100 = $20 + $10 = $30\n\n- Two medium trucks: 15+15 tons, cost $40\n\n- Four small trucks: 5*4=20 tons, cost $40\n\nSo, in this case, using one medium and one small truck is cheaper than using one large truck or two medium trucks.\n\nWait, $30 vs $40.\n\nSo, even though the large truck can carry all the cargo, it's more cost-effective to use a combination of medium and small trucks.\n\nThis suggests that simply using the largest available truck isn't always the most cost-effective approach.\n\nAnother example: 10 tons, 100 miles.\n\nOptions:\n\n- One medium truck: $20\n\n- Two small trucks: $20\n\n- One large truck: $40\n\nSo, using medium or two small trucks is better than using a large truck.\n\nWait, but medium and two small trucks cost the same, $20.\n\nBut medium truck has lower per ton-mile cost, but since two small trucks also meet the requirement, it's indifferent.\n\nBut perhaps using medium trucks is better in terms of fewer trucks used.\n\nAnother consideration: if a truck is used, there might be fixed costs associated with it, like loading and unloading costs, which are per truck, not per mile.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention that, so I'll ignore those for now.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems that for smaller cargo weights, using smaller trucks can be more cost-effective, especially when the large trucks have higher per mile costs and their full capacity isn't utilized.\n\nBut in the earlier example, using one medium and one small truck was cheaper than using one large truck for 20 tons.\n\nWait, but in that case, the total cost was $30 vs $40 for the large truck.\n\nSo, saving $10 by using both medium and small trucks.\n\nThis suggests that mixing truck types can lead to cost savings.\n\nBut managing multiple smaller trucks might be logistically more complicated.\n\nBut since the goal is purely cost minimization, we should consider the cheapest options.\n\nLet me think about it in terms of cost per ton-mile.\n\nAs calculated earlier:\n\n- Small: $0.02 per ton-mile\n\n- Medium and large: approximately $0.0133 per ton-mile\n\nSo, medium and large trucks are more efficient in terms of cost per ton-mile.\n\nHowever, in the 20-ton example, using one medium and one small truck was cheaper than using one large truck.\n\nWait, let's calculate the ton-miles for each option.\n\nFor 20 tons, 100 miles:\n\n- One large truck: 30 tons * 100 miles = 3000 ton-miles, cost $40\n\n- One medium and one small truck: 15 + 5 = 20 tons * 100 miles = 2000 ton-miles, cost $30\n\n- Two medium trucks: 30 tons * 100 miles = 3000 ton-miles, cost $40\n\n- Four small trucks: 20 tons * 100 miles = 2000 ton-miles, cost $40\n\nSo, in terms of cost per ton-mile:\n\n- Large truck: $40 / 3000 ton-miles = $0.0133 per ton-mile\n\n- Medium + small: $30 / 2000 ton-miles = $0.015 per ton-mile\n\n- Two medium trucks: $40 / 3000 ton-miles = $0.0133 per ton-mile\n\n- Four small trucks: $40 / 2000 ton-miles = $0.02 per ton-mile\n\nWait, so in this case, even though the medium + small combination has a higher cost per ton-mile, the total cost is lower than using the large truck.\n\nWait, but the cost per ton-mile for medium and small trucks is $0.0133 and $0.02, respectively.\n\nIn the combination, it's $30 for 2000 ton-miles, which is $0.015 per ton-mile.\n\nStill higher than the large truck's $0.0133 per ton-mile, but the total cost is lower.\n\nWait, this seems counterintuitive.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nOne medium truck: 15 tons capacity, but only 15 tons are needed out of 20.\n\nWait, no, the cargo is 20 tons, so one medium truck can only carry 15 tons, and one small truck carries the remaining 5 tons.\n\nSo, total cost is $0.20*100 + $0.10*100 = $20 + $10 = $30\n\nIf I use one large truck for 20 tons, it can carry all 20 tons, but its cost is $0.40*100 = $40\n\nSo, even though the large truck is more efficient in terms of cost per ton-mile, the total cost is higher because it's more expensive per mile.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation shows that cost per ton-mile for large truck is $0.0133, same as medium truck.\n\nBut in this case, using one medium and one small truck results in a lower total cost.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nLet me check the cost per mile for each truck:\n\n- Small: $0.10/mile\n\n- Medium: $0.20/mile\n\n- Large: $0.40/mile\n\nSo, for 100 miles:\n\n- Small: $10\n\n- Medium: $20\n\n- Large: $40\n\nNow, for 20 tons:\n\n- Option 1: one large truck, $40\n\n- Option 2: one medium and one small truck, $20 + $10 = $30\n\nSo, even though the large truck is more efficient in terms of cost per ton-mile, the combined cost of medium and small trucks is lower.\n\nThis suggests that sometimes combining smaller trucks can be more cost-effective, especially when the large truck's higher per mile cost isn't offset by the larger capacity.\n\nThis complicates things because it means I can't just assign the largest possible truck to each destination.\n\nI need to find a balance between utilizing truck capacity efficiently and minimizing per mile costs.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize using medium and small trucks over large trucks, unless the cargo requires the large capacity.\n\nBut, large trucks might be more cost-effective for very heavy loads where their capacity is fully utilized.\n\nLet me consider another example: 40 tons to a destination 100 miles away.\n\nOptions:\n\n- One large truck: can't carry 40 tons, capacity is only 30 tons\n\n- So, need at least two large trucks: $40 * 2 = $80\n\n- Or, two medium trucks: 15*2=30 tons, still need additional small trucks\n\n- So, two medium trucks and one small truck: $20*2 + $10 = $50\n\n- Or, one large truck and one medium truck: 30 + 15 = 45 tons, cost $40 + $20 = $60\n\n- Or, one large truck and two small trucks: 30 + 5*2=40 tons, cost $40 + $10*2 = $60\n\n- Or, four medium trucks: 15*4=60 tons, cost $20*4=$80\n\n- Or, eight small trucks: 5*8=40 tons, cost $10*8=$80\n\nSo, in this case, using two medium and one small truck is the cheapest option at $50.\n\nAgain, even though large trucks have lower cost per ton-mile, the per mile cost is higher, so combining medium and small trucks is cheaper.\n\nThis suggests that for higher cargo weights, it's better to use a combination of medium and small trucks rather than large trucks.\n\nWait, but in this case, using two medium and one small truck: total ton-miles is 35 tons * 100 miles = 3500 ton-miles, cost $50, which is $0.0143 per ton-mile.\n\nUsing one large and one medium truck: 45 tons * 100 miles = 4500 ton-miles, cost $60, which is $0.0133 per ton-mile.\n\nUsing one large and two small trucks: 40 tons * 100 miles = 4000 ton-miles, cost $60, which is $0.015 per ton-mile.\n\nUsing two medium and one small truck is cheaper in terms of total cost, but has a higher cost per ton-mile compared to one large and one medium truck.\n\nBut the total cost is lower.\n\nSo, perhaps focusing on total cost rather than cost per ton-mile is better.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider that for each destination, I need to find the combination of trucks that can carry the required cargo at the\u6700\u4f4e total cost, considering the fuel costs and distances.\n\nThen, across all destinations, ensure that the total number of trucks assigned does not exceed the available trucks.\n\nThis sounds like a vehicle routing problem with capacity constraints and cost minimization.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look into algorithms for solving such problems, like the Clarke and Wright savings algorithm, but that's typically for routing multiple stops with a fleet.\n\nAlternatively, since this seems like a linear programming problem, I can set it up as such.\n\nLet me try to define it more formally.\n\nIndex sets:\n\n- D: set of destinations\n\n- T: set of truck types {small, medium, large}\n\nParameters:\n\n- w_d: weight of cargo for destination d\n\n- d_d: distance to destination d\n\n- c_t: capacity of truck type t\n\n- f_t: fuel cost per mile for truck type t\n\n- a_t: available number of trucks of type t\n\nDecision variables:\n\n- x_{d,t}: number of trucks of type t assigned to destination d\n\nObjective function:\n\nMinimize sum_{d in D} sum_{t in T} x_{d,t} * f_t * d_d\n\nSubject to:\n\n1. For each destination d, the total capacity of trucks assigned to d must meet or exceed the cargo weight:\n\nfor all d in D:\n\nsum_{t in T} x_{d,t} * c_t >= w_d\n\n2. For each truck type t, the total number of trucks assigned cannot exceed the available trucks:\n\nfor all t in T:\n\nsum_{d in D} x_{d,t} <= a_t\n\n3. Non-negativity and integer constraints:\n\nx_{d,t} >= 0 and integer, for all d in D, t in T\n\nThis is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem.\n\nTo solve this, I would typically use an optimization solver like Gurobi, CPLEX, or open-source alternatives like CBC or GLPK.\n\nHowever, since I don't have specific values for D, w_d, and d_d, I can't solve it numerically.\n\nInstead, I can outline the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Collect data:\n\n- List of destinations with their respective cargo weights (w_d) and distances (d_d).\n\n- Truck types with their capacities (c_t), fuel costs per mile (f_t), and available quantities (a_t).\n\n2. Formulate the MILP model as described above.\n\n3. Input the data into an optimization solver.\n\n4. Solve the model to obtain the optimal assignment of trucks to destinations.\n\n5. Interpret the results to determine how many of each truck type should be assigned to each destination.\n\n6. If the problem is too large for an exact solver, consider using heuristic or approximation algorithms to find a near-optimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of destinations and truck types is small, it might be feasible to evaluate all possible combinations manually or through a simple script.\n\nBut in practice, with potentially many destinations and trucks, an optimization solver is the way to go.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can think about some strategies to make the model more efficient.\n\nFor example, I could preprocess the data to eliminate impossible assignments, such as assigning a truck type that cannot carry the required cargo weight.\n\nAlso, I could set upper bounds on x_{d,t} based on the available trucks and the cargo requirements.\n\nFurthermore, if certain truck types are dominated by others in terms of cost and capacity, I could remove them from consideration.\n\nFor instance, if a truck type has higher cost per ton-mile and lower capacity than another truck type, it's likely never optimal to use the dominated truck type.\n\nIn this case, small trucks have higher cost per ton-mile compared to medium and large trucks, so it might be better to avoid using small trucks unless necessary.\n\nBut as seen in earlier examples, sometimes using a combination of medium and small trucks can result in lower total costs.\n\nTherefore, small trucks cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\nAnother approach could be to prioritize using the most cost-effective truck types first, subject to their availability and the cargo requirements.\n\nFor example, start by assigning as many large trucks as possible to the destinations with the highest cargo weights, then fill in with medium and small trucks as needed.\n\nBut this might not always lead to the optimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the cost per mile for each truck type and prioritize assigning trucks with lower per mile costs, but also considering their capacities.\n\nWait, but medium and large trucks have different per mile costs and capacities.\n\nGiven that, it's not straightforward.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to calculate the cost per trip for each truck type to each destination and then determine the optimal assignment.\n\nBut since trucks can only be assigned to one destination at a time (assuming single trip), it's more about assigning the right truck types to the right destinations based on their cargo and distance.\n\nAnother idea is to calculate the cost per ton for each truck type per mile.\n\nWait, cost per ton-mile is already calculated:\n\n- Small: $0.02 per ton-mile\n\n- Medium and large: approximately $0.0133 per ton-mile\n\nSo, medium and large trucks are more efficient per ton-mile.\n\nBut earlier examples showed that using a combination of medium and small trucks can be cheaper in total cost.\n\nThis suggests that sometimes using smaller trucks can lead to cost savings, even if their per ton-mile cost is higher.\n\nPerhaps this is because the fixed per mile cost is spread over the tons being carried.\n\nIn other words, for lighter cargos, the higher per mile cost isn't as significant because there are fewer tons to carry.\n\nBut I need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the cost per ton to transport to a destination.\n\nFor a given truck type t and destination d:\n\nCost per ton = (f_t * d_d) / c_t\n\nSo, for small truck to destination d:\n\nCost per ton = ($0.10 * d_d) / 5\n\nSimilarly for medium and large trucks.\n\nThen, for each destination, I can calculate the cost per ton for each possible truck type that can carry the required weight and choose the truck type with the lowest cost per ton.\n\nBut, this might not account for the interactions between different destinations and truck availability.\n\nMoreover, if I have multiple trucks assigned to a destination, I need to ensure that the total capacity meets the cargo requirement.\n\nThis seems too simplistic for the problem at hand.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to model this as a transportation problem, where destinations are like \"customers\" with demand for a certain amount of cargo to be transported, and truck types are like \"suppliers\" with a certain capacity and cost.\n\nBut in this case, the supply is the truck capacity, and the demand is the cargo weight.\n\nHowever, the costs are a bit different because they depend on the distance to each destination.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as an assignment problem, where I assign trucks to destinations, but with multiple trucks possibly assigned to a single destination.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a generalized assignment problem formulation would be appropriate.\n\nIn the generalized assignment problem (GAP), agents (trucks) are assigned to tasks (destinations), with each assignment having a cost and a weight, and each agent having a capacity.\n\nIn our case:\n\n- Agents: trucks of different types, with available quantities\n\n- Tasks: destinations, each with a cargo weight and a distance\n\n- Cost: fuel cost per mile * distance for the truck type assigned\n\n- Capacity: truck capacity in terms of cargo weight\n\nHowever, in the standard GAP, the capacity constraint is per agent, meaning that each agent can be assigned multiple tasks as long as the total weight doesn't exceed its capacity.\n\nBut in our problem, each truck can only be assigned to one destination.\n\nTherefore, the standard GAP might not fit perfectly.\n\nAlternatively, I can model it by considering each truck as an individual agent, but that could lead to a very large number of decision variables.\n\nGiven that, sticking with the MILP formulation I initially proposed seems more appropriate.\n\nLet me summarize that again.\n\nDecision variables:\n\nx_{d,t}: number of trucks of type t assigned to destination d\n\nObjective:\n\nMinimize sum_{d in D} sum_{t in T} x_{d,t} * f_t * d_d\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. For each destination d:\n\nsum_{t in T} x_{d,t} * c_t >= w_d\n\n2. For each truck type t:\n\nsum_{d in D} x_{d,t} <= a_t\n\n3. x_{d,t} are non-negative integers\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nTo solve this, I would need to input the specific values for w_d, d_d, c_t, f_t, and a_t into an optimization solver.\n\nSince I don't have specific values, I can't compute the exact solution.\n\nHowever, if I were to implement this in practice, I would collect the necessary data, set up the model in an optimization software, and solve it to obtain the optimal assignment of trucks to destinations.\n\nAdditionally, if the problem is too large or complex for an exact solver, I could consider heuristic approaches, such as:\n\n1. Prioritizing assignments based on cost per ton-mile, assigning trucks to destinations where they can be most efficient.\n\n2. Using a greedy approach: assign the cheapest available truck that can handle the remaining cargo weight for each destination.\n\n3. Implementing a column generation approach, where I generate possible truck assignments and iteratively select the ones that offer the most cost savings.\n\n4. Applying metaheuristics like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms to search for a good solution.\n\nBut again, given the complexity, an exact optimization approach is preferable if computationally feasible.\n\nIn conclusion, the most cost-effective way to distribute the goods is to solve a mixed-integer linear programming problem that minimizes total fuel costs while ensuring that cargo requirements are met and truck availability constraints are respected.\n\nTo implement this, the company should use optimization software to solve the MILP model with their specific data on destinations, cargo weights, distances, truck capacities, fuel costs, and available trucks.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem of distributing goods cost-effectively, we need to minimize fuel expenses while ensuring all goods reach their destinations, given constraints on truck types, capacities, fuel costs, and availability.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Problem Understanding**:\n   - We have three truck types: small (5 tons), medium (15 tons), and large (30 tons).\n   - Fuel costs vary by truck size: small ($0.10/mile), medium ($0.20/mile), large ($0.40/mile).\n   - Fleet availability: 20 small, 10 medium, and 5 large trucks.\n   - Need to consider distances and cargo weights for each destination.\n\n2. **Formulation**:\n   - **Decision Variables**: Number of each truck type assigned to each destination.\n   - **Objective Function**: Minimize total fuel cost.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - Meet cargo capacity requirements for each destination.\n     - Do not exceed available trucks of each type.\n\n3. **Optimization Model**:\n   - **Objective**: Minimize sum over all destinations and truck types of (number of trucks * fuel cost per mile * distance).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - Total capacity of assigned trucks must meet or exceed the cargo weight for each destination.\n     - Total trucks assigned of each type do not exceed available trucks.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Use Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to solve the optimization problem.\n   - Input specific data on destinations, cargo weights, distances, truck capacities, fuel costs, and availability into an optimization solver.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nWhile we cannot provide a direct code solution without specific data, the general approach involves setting up the MILP model in optimization software like Gurobi, CPLEX, or open-source alternatives like CBC or GLPK.\n\nHere is a high-level outline of how you might set up this problem in Python using the Gurobi library:\n\n```python\nfrom gurobipy import Model, GRB\n\n# Data\ndestinations = [...]  # List of destinations\ncargo_weights = {...}  # Dictionary with cargo weight for each destination\ndistances = {...}  # Dictionary with distance for each destination\n\ntruck_types = ['small', 'medium', 'large']\ncapacities = {'small': 5, 'medium': 15, 'large': 30}\nfuel_costs = {'small': 0.10, 'medium': 0.20, 'large': 0.40}\navailability = {'small': 20, 'medium': 10, 'large': 5}\n\n# Model\nmodel = Model(' TruckAllocation')\n\n# Decision Variables\nx = {}\nfor d in destinations:\n    for t in truck_types:\n        x[d, t] = model.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name=f'x_{d}_{t}')\n\nmodel.update()\n\n# Objective Function\nmodel.setObjective(\n    sum(x[d, t] * fuel_costs[t] * distances[d] for d in destinations for t in truck_types),\n    GRB.MINIMIZE\n)\n\n# Constraints\n# Meet cargo requirements\nfor d in destinations:\n    model.addConstr(\n        sum(x[d, t] * capacities[t] for t in truck_types) >= cargo_weights[d],\n        name=f'cargo_{d}'\n    )\n\n# Do not exceed truck availability\nfor t in truck_types:\n    model.addConstr(\n        sum(x[d, t] for d in destinations) <= availability[t],\n        name=f'availability_{t}'\n    )\n\n# Optimize model\nmodel.optimize()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == GRB.OPTIMAL:\n    for d in destinations:\n        for t in truck_types:\n            print(f\"Trucks of type {t} assigned to {d}: {x[d,t].x}\")\n    print(f\"Total cost: {model.objVal}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Data Input**:\n   - Define lists and dictionaries for destinations, cargo weights, distances, truck types, capacities, fuel costs, and availability.\n\n2. **Model Setup**:\n   - Create a Gurobi model.\n   - Define integer decision variables for the number of each truck type assigned to each destination.\n\n3. **Objective Function**:\n   - Minimize the total fuel cost, calculated as the product of the number of trucks, fuel cost per mile, and distance for each assignment.\n\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - Ensure that the total capacity of assigned trucks meets or exceeds the cargo weight for each destination.\n   - Ensure that the total number of trucks assigned to all destinations does not exceed the available trucks of each type.\n\n5. **Optimization**:\n   - Solve the model to find the optimal assignment.\n   - Print the number of each truck type assigned to each destination and the total cost.\n\nThis approach ensures that the shipping company minimizes fuel costs while effectively utilizing their truck fleet to meet delivery requirements."
