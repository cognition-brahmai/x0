        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving City A going towards City B at 60 miles per hour, and the other leaving City B going towards City A at 80 miles per hour. The distance between the two cities is 420 miles. I need to find out how far from City A they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they approach each other. So, the combined speed is 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph. This means that together, they are closing the distance between them at a rate of 140 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the total distance between the cities is 420 miles. To find out how long it takes for them to meet, I can divide the total distance by their combined speed. So, time = distance / speed = 420 miles / 140 mph = 3 hours. So, they will meet after 3 hours.\n\nBut the question is asking for the distance from City A where they meet. Since the first train is leaving from City A at 60 mph, I can find out how far it travels in 3 hours. Distance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nTherefore, they will meet 180 miles away from City A.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the ratios of their speeds. The train from City A is going at 60 mph, and the train from City B is going at 80 mph. So, the ratio of their speeds is 60:80, which simplifies to 3:4.\n\nThis means that the train from City A will cover 3 parts of the distance, and the train from City B will cover 4 parts, out of a total of 7 parts.\n\nThe total distance is 420 miles, so each part is 420 / 7 = 60 miles.\n\nTherefore, the distance covered by the train from City A is 3 parts \u00d7 60 miles/part = 180 miles.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation, so I'm confident that the answer is 180 miles from City A.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of relative speed. Since they are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 140 mph, as I calculated before.\n\nThe time until they meet is the total distance divided by the relative speed, which is again 420 miles / 140 mph = 3 hours.\n\nThen, the distance from City A is the speed of the first train multiplied by time, which is 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nNo matter which method I use, I keep getting 180 miles. So, I think it's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check the distance covered by the second train from City B. It's going at 80 mph for 3 hours, so 80 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 240 miles.\n\nIf I add the distances covered by both trains, 180 miles + 240 miles = 420 miles, which matches the total distance between the cities. So, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the trains will meet 180 miles away from City A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]\n"
