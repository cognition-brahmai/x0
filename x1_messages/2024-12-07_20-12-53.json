        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many motorcycles there are in the city. We know that there are 150,000 registered vehicles in total, and 65% of these are cars. So, the remaining percentage must be motorcycles.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of cars:\n\nNumber of cars = 65% of 150,000\n\nTo find 65% of 150,000, we can multiply 150,000 by 0.65:\n\nNumber of cars = 150,000 * 0.65 = 97,500\n\nNow, to find the number of motorcycles, we subtract the number of cars from the total number of vehicles:\n\nNumber of motorcycles = Total vehicles - Number of cars\n\nNumber of motorcycles = 150,000 - 97,500 = 52,500\n\nSo, there are 52,500 motorcycles in the city.\n\nNext, the city decides to impose a tax of $50 per motorcycle. To find out how much total revenue will be generated from this tax, we need to multiply the number of motorcycles by the tax per motorcycle:\n\nTotal revenue = Number of motorcycles * Tax per motorcycle\n\nTotal revenue = 52,500 * 50\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n52,500 * 50 = 2,625,000\n\nSo, the city will generate $2,625,000 in revenue from this tax.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, percentage calculations can sometimes be tricky, so let's verify the number of cars and motorcycles again.\n\nTotal vehicles: 150,000\n\nPercentage of cars: 65%\n\nSo, number of cars: 150,000 * 0.65 = 97,500 (that seems correct)\n\nNumber of motorcycles: 150,000 - 97,500 = 52,500 (that also seems correct)\n\nTax per motorcycle: $50\n\nTotal revenue: 52,500 * 50 = 2,625,000\n\nYes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can calculate it as:\n\nFirst, find the percentage of motorcycles:\n\nSince 65% are cars, the remaining percentage is motorcycles:\n\n100% - 65% = 35%\n\nSo, motorcycles are 35% of the total vehicles.\n\nThen, number of motorcycles = 35% of 150,000\n\nNumber of motorcycles = 150,000 * 0.35 = 52,500\n\nSame result as before.\n\nThen, total revenue = 52,500 * 50 = 2,625,000\n\nSo, the city will generate $2,625,000 from this tax.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2625000} \\]"
