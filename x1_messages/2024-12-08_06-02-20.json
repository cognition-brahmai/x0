        "content": "So, the car rental company has 200 cars, and on average, 60% of them are rented out each day. We want to find out how many cars are rented in total over 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"rented out at an average rate of 60% per day\" means. Does this mean that each day, 60% of the total cars are rented, or that each car has a 60% chance of being rented each day?\n\nGiven that it's a rental company, I think it means that each day, 60% of the 200 cars are rented out. So, daily rentals would be 60% of 200.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n60% of 200 is 0.6 * 200 = 120 cars per day.\n\nNow, to find out the total rentals over 30 days, I can multiply the daily rentals by the number of days.\n\nSo, total rentals = 120 cars/day * 30 days = 3600 car Rentals.\n\nWait a minute, but this seems off. If they have only 200 cars, and they're rented out at 60% daily, that's 120 cars per day. Over 30 days, that would be 3600 car rentals. But, if the same cars are being rented out multiple times, this doesn't account for that.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the question is asking for the total number of cars rented out over the month, assuming that cars are rented and returned daily.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the total car-days rented.\n\nLet me clarify: a car-day is one car rented for one day.\n\nSo, if 120 cars are rented each day, and this happens for 30 days, then total car-days rented would be 120 * 30 = 3600 car-days.\n\nBut the question asks for \"how many cars will be rented in total over the course of a month.\"\n\nMaybe it's asking for the total number of unique cars rented during the month. Since they have 200 cars and rent out 120 per day, but cars can be rented multiple times, the total unique cars rented would still be 200, assuming all cars are rented at least once.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. If they rent out 120 different cars each day, but there are only 200 cars, some cars might be rented multiple times in the month, while others might not be rented at all.\n\nBut the question says \"on average, 60% per day.\" So, on average, 60% of the cars are rented each day, but it doesn't specify if it's always the same 60%, or if it varies.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to think in terms of car-days, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, total car-days rented = 120 cars/day * 30 days = 3600 car-days.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking for the total number of rentals, considering that one rental could be for multiple days.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to know the average length of each rental.\n\nBut the question doesn't provide information about the duration of each rental.\n\nAssuming that each rental is for one day, then total rentals would be equal to total car-days, which is 3600.\n\nBut if rentals can be for multiple days, then the total number of unique rentals would be less.\n\nFor example, if someone rents a car for 5 days, that's one rental but 5 car-days.\n\nWithout information on the average rental duration, it's hard to determine the exact number of unique rentals.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the simplest interpretation is to calculate total car-days rented, which is 3600.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question intends to ask how many cars are rented out each day on average, and then over 30 days, it would be 120 cars/day * 30 days = 3600 car Rentals.\n\nBut again, this assumes that each rental is for one day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the total number of cars rented out over the month, considering the daily rental rate.\n\nIn that case, since they rent out 120 cars each day, and there are 30 days, the total number of car Rentals would be 120 * 30 = 3600.\n\nBut this seems too straightforward, and perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the total number of days that cars are rented out, which would also be 3600 car-days.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the question, I think the answer is 3600 car Rentals, assuming each rental is for one day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3600} \\]"
