        "content": "To find out the total area of land the farmer has, we need to calculate the area of each field individually and then sum them up. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of Field A:\nField A is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide.\nArea of Field A = length \u00d7 width = 120 m \u00d7 80 m = 9600 square meters.\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of Field B:\nField B is 150 meters long and 60 meters wide.\nArea of Field B = length \u00d7 width = 150 m \u00d7 60 m = 9000 square meters.\n\nThen, let's calculate the area of Field C:\nField C is 180 meters long and 50 meters wide.\nArea of Field C = length \u00d7 width = 180 m \u00d7 50 m = 9000 square meters.\n\nNow, we'll add up the areas of all three fields to find the total area of land the farmer has:\nTotal area = Area of Field A + Area of Field B + Area of Field C = 9600 m\u00b2 + 9000 m\u00b2 + 9000 m\u00b2 = 27600 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the farmer has a total of 27,600 square meters of land.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27600} \\]"
