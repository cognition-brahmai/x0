        "content": "To determine the break-even point, which is the number of units that must be sold to cover both fixed and variable costs, we can use the break-even analysis formula. The break-even point in units is calculated by dividing the total fixed costs by the contribution margin per unit. The contribution margin per unit is the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit.\n\nGiven:\n- Selling price per unit = $200\n- Variable cost per unit = $80\n- Fixed costs = $20,000\n\nFirst, calculate the contribution margin per unit:\n\nContribution margin per unit = Selling price per unit - Variable cost per unit\nContribution margin per unit = $200 - $80\nContribution margin per unit = $120\n\nNext, calculate the break-even point in units:\n\nBreak-even point (units) = Fixed costs / Contribution margin per unit\nBreak-even point (units) = $20,000 / $120\nBreak-even point (units) = 166.666...\n\nSince a company cannot sell a fraction of a unit, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the company must sell 167 units to break even.\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the total revenue and total costs at 167 units:\n\nTotal revenue = Selling price per unit * Number of units\nTotal revenue = $200 * 167\nTotal revenue = $33,400\n\nTotal variable costs = Variable cost per unit * Number of units\nTotal variable costs = $80 * 167\nTotal variable costs = $13,360\n\nTotal costs = Fixed costs + Total variable costs\nTotal costs = $20,000 + $13,360\nTotal costs = $33,360\n\nAt 167 units, the total revenue ($33,400) is slightly higher than the total costs ($33,360), indicating that 167 units are indeed enough to break even.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider 166 units:\n\nTotal revenue = $200 * 166 = $33,200\nTotal variable costs = $80 * 166 = $13,280\nTotal costs = $20,000 + $13,280 = $33,280\n\nIn this case, total revenue ($33,200) is less than total costs ($33,280), meaning the company would still be in a loss position. Therefore, selling 167 units is necessary to break even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{167} \\]"
