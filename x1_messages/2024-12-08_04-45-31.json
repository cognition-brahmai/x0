        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a simple console application in C# that calculates the factorial of a given number. I need to make sure that the input is a non-negative integer and handle any exceptions that might occur.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a factorial is. Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120. Also, by definition, 0! is 1.\n\nNow, I need to get user input and ensure it's a non-negative integer. I should use exception handling to manage any invalid inputs.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n\n2. Read the input from the console.\n\n3. Convert the input to an integer.\n\n4. Check if the integer is non-negative.\n\n5. If it is, calculate the factorial.\n\n6. If not, handle the error appropriately.\n\n7. Display the result.\n\nI need to handle cases where the input is not a number or is a negative number. For this, I'll use try-catch blocks.\n\nAlso, factorials can get very large very quickly, so I should consider using a data type that can handle large numbers, like BigInteger.\n\nWait, in C#, the BigInteger class is part of the System.Numerics namespace, so I'll need to include that.\n\nLet me think about the implementation.\n\nI'll start by writing a method to calculate the factorial. I can do this iteratively or recursively. Since recursion can lead to stack overflows for large numbers, I'll go with an iterative approach.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the method:\n\npublic static BigInteger Factorial(int n)\n\n{\n\n    BigInteger result = 1;\n\n    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)\n\n    {\n\n        result *= i;\n\n    }\n\n    return result;\n\n}\n\nI need to make sure that n is non-negative. If n is negative, I should throw an exception.\n\nWait, in the main method, I'll already be ensuring that n is non-negative, so maybe I don't need to throw an exception in the Factorial method.\n\nBut to be safe, I can add a check.\n\nNow, for the main method:\n\n- Prompt user for input\n\n- Read input as string\n\n- Try to parse it to int\n\n- If successful, check if it's non-negative\n\n- If yes, calculate factorial and display\n\n- If not, display an error message\n\n- If parsing fails, display an error message\n\nI should also consider that the user might enter a floating-point number or some other invalid input.\n\nLet me think about edge cases:\n\n- n = 0 -> factorial is 1\n\n- n = 1 -> factorial is 1\n\n- n = 5 -> factorial is 120\n\n- n = 20 -> factorial is 2432902008176640000\n\n- n = -1 -> invalid\n\n- n = 100 -> factorial is a very large number, but BigInteger can handle it\n\nI should also consider performance, but for factorials of large numbers, it's inevitable that calculations might take time.\n\nI need to make sure that the program doesn't crash if the user enters a very large number, but since BigInteger can handle large numbers, it should be fine.\n\nLet me think about the user interface. I should provide clear instructions and handle errors gracefully.\n\nFor example:\n\nEnter a non-negative integer: abc\n\nError: Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\n\nOr\n\nEnter a non-negative integer: -5\n\nError: Input must be a non-negative integer.\n\nAlso, after displaying the error, it would be nice to prompt the user again to enter a valid input, instead of exiting the program.\n\nWait, for simplicity, in this console application, I'll assume that the user will enter the correct input after being prompted once. But to make it more robust, I can add a loop to keep asking until a valid input is provided.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll just handle one input attempt.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nI'll need to:\n\n- Use the System namespace for basic types and operations.\n\n- Use System.Numerics for BigInteger.\n\n- Use System.Console for input and output.\n\nI need to ensure that the project references System.Numerics, but in modern C# versions, this should be available by default.\n\nLet me write a draft of the code.\n\nFirst, define the Factorial method:\n\nusing System;\n\nusing System.Numerics;\n\npublic class Program\n\n{\n\n    public static BigInteger Factorial(int n)\n\n    {\n\n        if (n < 0)\n\n        {\n\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\");\n\n        }\n\n        BigInteger result = 1;\n\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)\n\n        {\n\n            result *= i;\n\n        }\n\n        return result;\n\n    }\n\n    public static void Main()\n\n    {\n\n        try\n\n        {\n\n            Console.Write(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n\n            string input = Console.ReadLine();\n\n            int number = int.Parse(input);\n\n            if (number < 0)\n\n            {\n\n                throw new ArgumentException(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\");\n\n            }\n\n            BigInteger factorial = Factorial(number);\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial}.\");\n\n        }\n\n        catch (FormatException)\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\");\n\n        }\n\n        catch (ArgumentException ex)\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Error: {ex.Message}\");\n\n        }\n\n        catch (Exception ex)\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"An error occurred: {ex.Message}\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis seems straightforward. Let me test this logic with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nEnter a non-negative integer: 5\n\nThe factorial of 5 is 120.\n\nExample 2:\n\nEnter a non-negative integer: -1\n\nError: Input must be a non-negative integer.\n\nExample 3:\n\nEnter a non-negative integer: abc\n\nError: Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\n\nExample 4:\n\nEnter a non-negative integer: 20\n\nThe factorial of 20 is 2432902008176640000.\n\nExample 5:\n\nEnter a non-negative integer: 0\n\nThe factorial of 0 is 1.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nI should also consider if the user enters a floating-point number.\n\nEnter a non-negative integer: 5.5\n\nError: Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\n\nGood, because int.Parse will throw a FormatException.\n\nAlternatively, I could use int.TryParse, which is better because it doesn't throw an exception on failure.\n\nLet me think about using int.TryParse.\n\nIt's more efficient because it avoids exception handling for invalid inputs.\n\nHere's how I can use it:\n\npublic static void Main()\n\n{\n\n    Console.Write(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n\n    string input = Console.ReadLine();\n\n    if (int.TryParse(input, out int number))\n\n    {\n\n        if (number < 0)\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Input must be a non-negative integer.\");\n\n        }\n\n        else\n\n        {\n\n            BigInteger factorial = Factorial(number);\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial}.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    else\n\n    {\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\");\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis is cleaner and avoids unnecessary exception handling.\n\nI should also consider if the number is too large for int. But since factorial grows very fast, even small integers can result in very large factorials, hence the use of BigInteger.\n\nBut for the input, int should suffice for small numbers. If needed, I can use long, but BigInteger can handle large numbers anyway.\n\nI think int is sufficient for the input.\n\nLet me also think about localizing the application. Should I consider culture-specific number formats? For simplicity, I'll assume that the user inputs numbers in the invariant culture.\n\nAdditionally, I can add some comments to the code for clarity.\n\nFinally, I should test the application with various inputs to ensure it works as expected.\n\nIn summary, here's the final code:\n\nusing System;\n\nusing System.Numerics;\n\npublic class Program\n\n{\n\n    /// <summary>\n\n    /// Calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.\n\n    /// </summary>\n\n    /// <param name=\"n\">The non-negative integer to calculate the factorial of.</param>\n\n    /// <returns>The factorial of n as a BigInteger.</returns>\n\n    /// <exception cref=\"ArgumentException\">If n is negative.</exception>\n\n    public static BigInteger Factorial(int n)\n\n    {\n\n        if (n < 0)\n\n        {\n\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\");\n\n        }\n\n        BigInteger result = 1;\n\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)\n\n        {\n\n            result *= i;\n\n        }\n\n        return result;\n\n    }\n\n    /// <summary>\n\n    /// The main entry point of the application.\n\n    /// </summary>\n\n    public static void Main()\n\n    {\n\n        try\n\n        {\n\n            Console.Write(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n\n            string input = Console.ReadLine();\n\n            if (int.TryParse(input, out int number))\n\n            {\n\n                if (number < 0)\n\n                {\n\n                    throw new ArgumentException(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\");\n\n                }\n\n                BigInteger factorial = Factorial(number);\n\n                Console.WriteLine($\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial}.\");\n\n            }\n\n            else\n\n            {\n\n                throw new FormatException(\"Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\");\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        catch (FormatException ex)\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Error: {ex.Message}\");\n\n        }\n\n        catch (ArgumentException ex)\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Error: {ex.Message}\");\n\n        }\n\n        catch (Exception ex)\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"An error occurred: {ex.Message}\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis should meet the requirements."
