        "content": "Reversing a singly linked list without using any additional data structures is a classic problem in computer science, often encountered in coding interviews and algorithms courses. The challenge lies in manipulating the pointers of the nodes to reverse the direction of the list efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**: We need three pointers to keep track of the previous node, the current node, and the next node.\n2. **Iteration**: Traverse the list, updating the pointers as follows:\n   - Before moving to the next node, store the next node.\n   - Reverse the current node's next pointer to point to the previous node.\n   - Move the previous and current pointers one step ahead.\n3. **Termination**: When the current pointer becomes `None`, the previous pointer will be at the new head of the reversed list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head):\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current:\n        next_node = current.next  # Store next node\n        current.next = prev       # Reverse current node's pointer\n        prev = current            # Move pointers one position ahead\n        current = next_node\n    return prev\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `prev` is initialized to `None` because initially, there is no node before the head.\n   - `current` is set to the head of the list.\n\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - In each iteration, `next_node` stores the next node to prevent losing reference when we reverse the current node's next pointer.\n   - The current node's next pointer is set to `prev`, effectively reversing the link.\n   - `prev` and `current` are then moved one step forward in the list.\n\n3. **Termination**:\n   - The loop continues until `current` is `None`, which means the end of the original list is reached.\n   - At this point, `prev` is the new head of the reversed list.\n\nThis method ensures that the list is reversed in-place with O(1) extra space and O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the list."
