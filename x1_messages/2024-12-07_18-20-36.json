        "content": "Certainly! I'd be happy to create a high-protein, low-sugar smoothie recipe for you. Here's what you'll need:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. 1 scoop (about 30 grams) of vanilla or unflavored plant-based protein powder\n2. 1 cup (about 150 grams) of frozen unsweetened mixed berries\n3. 1/2 cup (about 120 grams) of plain Greek yogurt or coconut yogurt\n4. 1/2 medium banana (about 75 grams)\n5. 1 tablespoon (about 15 grams) of chia seeds\n6. 1 cup (about 240 ml) of unsweetened almond milk or your preferred low-sugar milk alternative\n\n**Preparation Steps:**\n\n1. **Gather all ingredients:** Make sure you have all the ingredients listed above before starting.\n\n2. **Measure the protein powder:** Use a measuring scoop to get exactly 30 grams of protein powder. Choose a vanilla or unflavored option to keep the smoothie low in added sugars.\n\n3. **Prepare the berries:** If using frozen berries, ensure they are well-thawed or use them straight from the freezer. Measure out 1 cup.\n\n4. **Measure the yogurt:** Scoop out 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt or coconut yogurt. Avoid flavored yogurts as they may contain added sugars.\n\n5. **Peel and slice the banana:** Take half a medium banana, peel it, and slice it into pieces for easier blending.\n\n6. **Measure the chia seeds:** Add 1 tablespoon of chia seeds for an extra boost of omega-3 fatty acids and fiber.\n\n7. **Pour in the milk:** Measure 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk or another low-sugar milk alternative.\n\n8. **Combine all ingredients:** Place all the measured ingredients into a blender.\n\n9. **Blend until smooth:** Start blending on low speed and gradually increase to high. Blend until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps. If the smoothie is too thick, add a bit more milk; if it's too thin, add a few ice cubes.\n\n10. **Taste and adjust:** Give the smoothie a taste. If it needs a slight sweetener, consider adding a small amount of stevia or a dash of cinnamon instead of sugar.\n\n11. **Serve immediately:** Pour the smoothie into a glass and enjoy it right away for the best taste and texture.\n\nThis smoothie is packed with protein from the yogurt and protein powder, while the berries and banana provide natural sweetness without adding too much sugar. The chia seeds add healthy fats and extra nutrition. It's a perfect blend for a nutritious and satisfying meal or snack!"
