        "content": "Let's see here. We have two trains: one leaving Station A going towards Station B at 60 mph, and the other leaving Station B going towards Station A at 90 mph. The distance between the two stations is 180 miles. We need to figure out when and where they meet, and then determine which train is closer to Station A when they meet.\n\nFirst, I need to find out after how much time they meet. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So the relative speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph. The total distance between them is 180 miles, so the time it takes for them to meet is distance divided by relative speed, which is 180 miles / 150 mph = 1.2 hours.\n\nNow, to find out where they meet, I can calculate how far each train travels in 1.2 hours. The first train from Station A is going at 60 mph, so in 1.2 hours, it travels 60 mph * 1.2 hours = 72 miles. The second train from Station B is going at 90 mph, so in 1.2 hours, it travels 90 mph * 1.2 hours = 108 miles.\n\nSo, they meet at a point that is 72 miles from Station A and 108 miles from Station B. Now, the question is, which train is closer to Station A when they meet. Well, both trains are at the same point when they meet, so they are equally distant from Station A. That means both trains are 72 miles away from Station A at that moment.\n\nWait a minute, but the question seems to be a trick question. It's asking which train is closer to Station A when they meet. But since they are meeting at the same point, both trains are at the same location, so they are equally close to Station A. Therefore, neither is closer than the other; they are both the same distance away from Station A.\n\nI think the answer is that both trains are equally close to Station A when they meet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Both trains are equally close to Station A when they meet.}} \\]"
