        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. I need to find the probability that when I roll a fair six-sided die three times, the sum of the numbers comes out to be exactly 10. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a fair six-sided die has numbers from 1 to 6, and each roll is independent of the others. So, for three rolls, there are a total of 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 possible outcomes, since each roll has 6 possible results.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 216 outcomes sum up to exactly 10. One way to approach this is to list all the possible combinations of three numbers between 1 and 6 that add up to 10. But that seems a bit tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, there's a method called \"stars and bars\" for finding the number of ways to distribute items into groups. However, that method doesn't account for the upper limit on each die, which is 6 in this case. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me try to find the number of solutions to the equation:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 10\n\nwhere each xi (for i = 1,2,3) is an integer between 1 and 6, inclusive.\n\nFirst, I can make a substitution to make the variables start from 0 instead of 1. Let's set yi = xi - 1, so yi \u2265 0. Then the equation becomes:\n\n(y1 + 1) + (y2 + 1) + (y3 + 1) = 10\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\ny1 + y2 + y3 = 7\n\nNow, I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation, where each yi is at most 5 (since xi \u2264 6, so yi = xi - 1 \u2264 5).\n\nWithout considering the upper limit, the number of non-negative integer solutions to y1 + y2 + y3 = 7 is given by the binomial coefficient C(7 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(9, 2) = 36.\n\nBut I have to subtract the cases where one or more yi are greater than 5.\n\nLet's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this.\n\nFirst, find the number of solutions where y1 \u2265 6. Let z1 = y1 - 6, then z1 \u2265 0, and the equation becomes:\n\nz1 + y2 + y3 = 1\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to this is C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nSimilarly, there are 3 solutions where y2 \u2265 6, and 3 where y3 \u2265 6.\n\nHowever, it's not possible for two variables to both be greater than 5, because 6 + 6 = 12, which is already more than 7. So, no need to add back any intersections.\n\nTherefore, the number of invalid solutions is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.\n\nThus, the number of valid solutions is 36 - 9 = 27.\n\nSo, there are 27 favorable outcomes where the sum is exactly 10.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 27/216.\n\nSimplifying that fraction, 27 divided by 27 is 1, and 216 divided by 27 is 8, so it's 1/8.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total possible outcomes: 6^3 = 216. That's correct.\n\nThen, number of solutions to y1 + y2 + y3 = 7 with 0 \u2264 yi \u2264 5.\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal solutions without constraints: C(9,2) = 36.\n\nSubtract the cases where one yi \u2265 6: 3 * C(3,2) = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nSo, 36 - 9 = 27 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, probability is 27/216 = 1/8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list out the possible combinations to verify.\n\nLet's see:\n\nPossible triples (x1,x2,x3) where x1 + x2 + x3 = 10, and 1 \u2264 xi \u2264 6.\n\nLet me list them systematically.\n\nStart with x1 = 2:\n\nThen x2 + x3 = 8.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2).\n\nThat's 5 combinations.\n\nx1 = 3:\n\nx2 + x3 = 7.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1).\n\nThat's 6 combinations.\n\nx1 = 4:\n\nx2 + x3 = 6.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1).\n\nThat's 5 combinations.\n\nx1 = 5:\n\nx2 + x3 = 5.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1).\n\nThat's 4 combinations.\n\nx1 = 6:\n\nx2 + x3 = 4.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(1,3), (2,2), (3,1).\n\nThat's 3 combinations.\n\nTotal: 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 23.\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation of 27.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in listing.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nx1 = 2:\n\n(2,6,2), (2,5,3), (2,4,4), (2,3,5), (2,2,6). That's 5.\n\nx1 = 3:\n\n(3,1,6), (3,2,5), (3,3,4), (3,4,3), (3,5,2), (3,6,1). That's 6.\n\nx1 = 4:\n\n(4,1,5), (4,2,4), (4,3,3), (4,4,2), (4,5,1). That's 5.\n\nx1 = 5:\n\n(5,1,4), (5,2,3), (5,3,2), (5,4,1). That's 4.\n\nx1 = 6:\n\n(6,1,3), (6,2,2), (6,3,1). That's 3.\n\nTotal is indeed 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 23.\n\nSo, earlier, my inclusion-exclusion calculation must have been wrong.\n\nLet me revisit that.\n\nTotal solutions to y1 + y2 + y3 = 7 with 0 \u2264 yi \u2264 5.\n\nWithout constraints: C(9,2) = 36.\n\nSubtract the cases where one yi \u2265 6.\n\nFor y1 \u2265 6: set z1 = y1 - 6, then z1 + y2 + y3 = 1.\n\nNumber of solutions: C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3,2) = 3.\n\nSimilarly for y2 and y3: total 9 invalid solutions.\n\nSo, 36 - 9 = 27.\n\nBut according to the list, there are only 23 valid solutions.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nPerhaps some of the solutions where yi \u2265 6 are being double-counted or something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that it's not possible for two yi to be \u22656 simultaneously, since 6+6=12 > 7.\n\nSo, no need to add back any intersections.\n\nThus, the inclusion-exclusion should be correct: 36 - 9 = 27.\n\nBut the listing only gives 23.\n\nWhere is the mistake?\n\nAh, I think I see the problem.\n\nIn the listing, I started x1 from 2 up to 6.\n\nBut x1 can be 1 as well.\n\nWait, x1 is at least 1, so x1 = 1:\n\nThen x2 + x3 = 9.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3).\n\nThat's 4 more combinations.\n\nSo, total: 23 + 4 = 27.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI forgot to include x1 = 1 in the listing.\n\nSo, there are indeed 27 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 27/216 = 1/8.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}} \\]"
