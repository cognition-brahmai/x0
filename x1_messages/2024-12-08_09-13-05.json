        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! So, you need a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from that array. Also, it should handle edge cases like empty arrays or non-integer inputs. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on are prime numbers.\n\nNow, for the function:\n\n1. **Input Handling:** The function should accept an array of integers. We need to make sure that the input is indeed an array and that it contains only integers. If the input is not an array or contains non-integer elements, we might need to handle those cases appropriately.\n\n2. **Edge Cases:** We need to consider edge cases such as:\n   - An empty array: In this case, the function should return an empty array.\n   - An array with only one element: The function should check if that element is a prime number.\n   - An array with non-integer values: We should either ignore these or handle them in some way.\n   - Negative numbers: By definition, prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1, so negative numbers should not be considered prime.\n\n3. **Prime Check:** We need a helper function to check if a number is prime. This function should take an integer and return true if it's prime, else false.\n\n4. **Filtering the Array:** Use the helper function to filter the input array and create a new array containing only prime numbers.\n\nLet's start by writing the helper function to check if a number is prime.\n\n### Helper Function: Is Prime\n\n```javascript\nfunction isPrime(num) {\n    // Check if the number is less than 2\n    if (num < 2) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    // Check if the number is 2\n    if (num === 2) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    // Check if the number is even\n    if (num % 2 === 0) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    // Check for factors up to the square root of the number\n    const sqrt = Math.sqrt(num);\n    for (let i = 3; i <= sqrt; i += 2) {\n        if (num % i === 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n### Main Function: Filter Primes\n\nNow, let's write the main function that filters the array.\n\n```javascript\nfunction filterPrimes(arr) {\n    // Check if the input is an array\n    if (!Array.isArray(arr)) {\n        return \"Input must be an array.\";\n    }\n    \n    // Filter the array to include only integers and then filter primes\n    return arr.filter(Number.isInteger).filter(isPrime);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Validation:** We first check if the input is an array using `Array.isArray(arr)`. If not, we return an error message. You can adjust this behavior based on your requirements.\n   \n2. **Filter Integers:** We use `Number.isInteger` to filter out non-integer values from the array.\n   \n3. **Filter Primes:** We use the `isPrime` helper function to filter out only the prime numbers from the integer array.\n\n### Handling Edge Cases\n\n- **Empty Array:** If the input array is empty, the function will return an empty array, which is correct.\n- **Single Element:** If the array has only one element, it will check if that element is a prime number and return it in an array if it is, else an empty array.\n- **Non-integer Values:** These are filtered out before checking for primes.\n- **Negative Numbers:** The `isPrime` function handles negative numbers by returning false, as they are not prime.\n\nThis should cover all the requirements and edge cases you mentioned. If you have any specific requirements or need further adjustments, feel free to ask!"
