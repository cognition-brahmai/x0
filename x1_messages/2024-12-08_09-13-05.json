        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 250 units per day and operates for 5 days a week. I need to find out how many units it will produce in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the weekly production. Since it works 5 days a week and produces 250 units each day, I can multiply 250 by 5.\n\n250 units/day * 5 days/week = 1250 units/week\n\nNow, to find out the production for 4 weeks, I need to multiply the weekly production by 4.\n\n1250 units/week * 4 weeks = 5000 units\n\nSo, the factory will produce 5000 units in 4 weeks.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total number of days the factory operates in 4 weeks and then multiply by the daily production.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days:\n\n5 days/week * 4 weeks = 20 days\n\nThen, multiply by daily production:\n\n250 units/day * 20 days = 5000 units\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, the answer is indeed 5000 units.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the average weekly production and then scale it up for 4 weeks.\n\nAverage weekly production is 1250 units, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, for 4 weeks: 1250 * 4 = 5000 units.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there might be holidays or downtime, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume it operates consistently.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"4 weeks,\" so I don't need to account for partial weeks or anything like that.\n\nTherefore, the total production is 5000 units.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the production, like weekends or overtime. But according to the problem, the factory operates 5 days a week, so weekends are already factored in.\n\nSo, no need to adjust for that.\n\nHence, the final answer is 5000 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5000} \\]"
