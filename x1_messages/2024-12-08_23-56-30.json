So, you're asking about a big animal from Africa that has a long neck and a spotted coat, and it doesn't sleep much\u2014less than two hours a day on average. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, Africa is home to many large mammals, like elephants, giraffes, lions, and zebras, just to name a few. Now, you mentioned a long neck and a spotted coat. A long neck makes me think of a giraffe, but giraffes have a distinct spotted pattern on their coats, which matches the description.\n\nWait, giraffes are known for their long necks and their spotted coats, which can vary in pattern depending on the subspecies. Some have larger, irregular spots, while others have smaller, more oval-shaped spots. So, that seems to fit the description.\n\nNow, about the sleeping habits. I've heard that giraffes don't sleep much, but I'm not sure about the exact amount. Let me recall what I know. Giraffes are animals that need to be vigilant for predators, so they don't spend a lot of time sleeping. They can sleep standing up, which is pretty amazing, and they take short naps throughout the day.\n\nI think it's true that they sleep less than two hours a day on average. They might have several short sleep sessions adding up to that total. It makes sense because sleeping makes them vulnerable to predators, so they try to minimize the time they spend sleeping.\n\nIs there any other animal in Africa with a long neck and a spotted coat? Hmm, not that I can think of. Giraffes are unique in that regard. There are other animals with spots, like leopards, but they don't have long necks like giraffes.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is a giraffe. What do you think?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{giraffe}} \\]"
