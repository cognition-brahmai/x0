That seems pretty unlikely because sound doesn't travel that far when it's soft. But maybe under special conditions, like if there's absolute silence and no wind to distort the sound waves, it might be possible for someone with really good hearing to hear a whisper from far away. Or maybe with some kind of amplification device. But naturally, without any help, it's probably not possible for a human to hear a whisper from a mile away."
