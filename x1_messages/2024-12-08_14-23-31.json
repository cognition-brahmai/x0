The far side, often mistakenly called the \"dark side,\" isn't always dark; it receives sunlight just like the near side does, but it's the side we can't see from Earth because the Moon is tidally locked to our planet. This means that the Moon takes the same amount of time to rotate on its axis as it does to orbit Earth, so the same side always faces us. However, both sides experience day and night cycles as the Moon orbits Earth."
