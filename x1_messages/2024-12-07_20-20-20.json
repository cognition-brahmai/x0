        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains leaving different towns and traveling towards each other, and I need to figure out how long it will take for them to meet. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, I know that Town A and Town B are 300 miles apart. One train is leaving Town A going towards Town B at 50 miles per hour, and the other train is leaving Town B going towards Town A at 70 miles per hour. Both trains are leaving at the same time, so they're starting their journeys simultaneously.\n\nOkay, so I need to find out when they will meet. I think the key here is to consider their combined speeds because they're moving towards each other. If one train is going at 50 mph and the other at 70 mph, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, 50 plus 70 is 120 miles per hour.\n\nNow, if they're approaching each other at a combined speed of 120 mph and the distance between them is 300 miles, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time equals 300 miles divided by 120 mph.\n\nLet me do the math: 300 divided by 120 is 2.5 hours.\n\nWait, but does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIn 2.5 hours, the first train, traveling at 50 mph, would cover 50 times 2.5, which is 125 miles.\n\nThe second train, traveling at 70 mph, would cover 70 times 2.5, which is 175 miles.\n\nAdding those distances: 125 plus 175 equals 300 miles, which is exactly the distance between the two towns.\n\nSo, yes, they would meet after 2.5 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to consider the time it takes for the combined distances they cover to equal the total distance between the towns.\n\nSo, let\u2019s denote the time as t hours.\n\nThen, the distance covered by the first train is 50t miles, and the distance covered by the second train is 70t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the initial distance between the towns:\n\n50t + 70t = 300\n\nCombining like terms: 120t = 300\n\nNow, solving for t: t = 300 / 120 = 2.5 hours\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the concept of relative speed. When two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nSo, relative speed = 50 mph + 70 mph = 120 mph\n\nThen, time to meet = total distance / relative speed = 300 miles / 120 mph = 2.5 hours\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, is the direction of travel important here, or the length of the trains, or any other variables?\n\nFrom the problem, it seems like we can ignore the lengths of the trains, and we're only concerned with their speeds and the distance between the towns.\n\nAlso, assuming they're traveling on a straight track directly towards each other, without any changes in speed or direction.\n\nSo, based on that, I'm confident that 2.5 hours is the correct answer.\n\nJust to put it in different units, 2.5 hours is 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nSo, they will meet after 2 hours and 30 minutes from the time they both leave their respective towns.\n\nI don't think there's more to it. It's a straightforward relative speed problem.\n\nBut it's always good to double-check.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe using the concept of closing the gap.\n\nInitially, the gap between the two trains is 300 miles.\n\nEach hour, the first train closes the gap by 50 miles, and the second train closes it by 70 miles.\n\nTogether, they close the gap by 120 miles per hour.\n\nSo, the time to close the entire gap is 300 miles / 120 miles per hour = 2.5 hours.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's solid.\n\nAlright, I'm satisfied with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
