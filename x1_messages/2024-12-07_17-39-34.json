        "content": "So I have this problem here: a baker uses 2 eggs to make 3 cupcakes. I need to find out how many eggs she needs to make 24 cupcakes. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between eggs and cupcakes. The problem says that 2 eggs are used for 3 cupcakes. That means that for every 3 cupcakes, she uses 2 eggs. I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 24 cupcakes.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to find out how many sets of 3 cupcakes are there in 24 cupcakes. Because for each set of 3 cupcakes, she uses 2 eggs. So, if I can find out how many sets of 3 are in 24, then I can multiply that by 2 to get the total number of eggs needed.\n\nLet me calculate that. 24 divided by 3 is 8. So, there are 8 sets of 3 cupcakes in 24 cupcakes. Now, since each set requires 2 eggs, I can multiply 8 by 2 to get the total number of eggs.\n\n8 times 2 is 16. So, she needs 16 eggs to make 24 cupcakes.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using proportions. I know that in math, proportions can be useful for these kinds of problems.\n\nLet's try setting up a proportion. If 2 eggs are needed for 3 cupcakes, then x eggs are needed for 24 cupcakes. So, the proportion would be:\n\n2 eggs / 3 cupcakes = x eggs / 24 cupcakes\n\nNow, I can solve for x by cross-multiplying.\n\n2 * 24 = 3 * x\n\n48 = 3x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x.\n\n48 divided by 3 is 16.\n\nSo, x = 16 eggs.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. Good, it's consistent.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe in terms of unit rates. How many eggs are needed per cupcake?\n\nIf 2 eggs make 3 cupcakes, then the number of eggs per cupcake is 2/3.\n\nSo, for one cupcake, she needs 2/3 of an egg.\n\nTherefore, for 24 cupcakes, she would need 24 times 2/3 eggs.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n24 times 2/3 is (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16 eggs.\n\nAgain, I get 16 eggs.\n\nAlright, so no matter which method I use, I end up with 16 eggs needed for 24 cupcakes.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. The answer should be 16 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
