New details emerging about an Al Qaeda plot. An Al Qaeda operative testified in a federal terror trial in Brooklyn about a plan to attack the Long Island railroad train with a suicide bomb as it entered a tunnel. Brian Denis also testified that the group was planning to target various Wal-Mart locations. He\\'s a native of long island who joined the army and then later Al Qaeda. He\\'s testifying at the trial of a Queens College grad accused of conspiring in a plot to bomb New York City subways. It looks like another dead end in the long and frustrating search to find Etan Patz. The FBI has told the family of Etan Patz that an extensive search of a basement near their home in lower Manhattan has come up empty. Investigators are looking for clues in the disappearance of this six-year-old boy, a disappearance 33 years ago. An FBI source tells CNN that no obvious human remains have been found. Jennifer Hudson broke down in tears as she testified against the man accused of killing her family. The singer says she did not want her sister to marry William Balfour. Balfour is now estranged husband of Hudson\\'s sister, Julia. He\\'s accused of shooting Hudson\\'s mother, brother and little nephew. Julia also testified yesterday, saying Balfour threatened to kill the family. He has pleaded not guilty. NFL hall of famer Deion Sanders and his wife taking their public battle up a notch. Pilar Sanders was arrested for allegedly attacking her husband last night. Deion was tweeting about the assault. He wrote, \"Pray for me and my kids now! They just witnessed their mother and a friend jump me in my room. She\\'s going to jail and I\\'m pressing charges!\" He even posted pictures of he and his kids filling out police reports. The prostitution scandal involving the Secret Service and the Pentagon growing bigger by the day. The number of military personnel implicated is now 12 in addition to 12 Secret Service agents under investigation for alleged misconduct in Cartagena, Columbia ahead of the president\\'s trip earlier this month. We\\'re getting a first look at the Colombian woman who brought the entire incident to light. She\\'s identified as 24-year-old Dania Suarez. She was involved in a dispute over how much money she was going to get paid. Today\\'s \"A.M. House Call,\" new revelations on the future of Medicare and Social Security. Research shows funding is drying up. Full Medicare funding is only projected to last now through 2024. After that, patients could receive only partial funding. That\\'s unless Congress make some changes. Social Security is only expected to last now until 2033, three years earlier than previously projected. Experts blame the rising health costs and an aging population. And this is a dangerous, troubling new trend, teens getting drunk from hand sanitizer and landing in the emergency room. Six teens in Los Angeles have been treated for alcohol poisoning in the last few months from drinking hand sanitizer. It\\'s cheap, it\\'s easy to get. It makes 120-proof liquid, equivalent to a shot of gin or whiskey. Experts are now warning parents to buy foam rather than gel sanitizer because it\\'s harder to extract the alcohol. I think that switching to foam is the least parents need to be doing if they find out their drinking this. O\\'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, that\\'s a disturbing, sick, sick story. That\\'s just crazy. All right, Christine, thank you for the update. On the heels of the New Orleans Saints\\' bounty scandal, the team is facing another controversy this morning. ESPN is reporting Saints\\' General Manager Mickey Loomis allegedly eavesdropped on visiting teams with a secret electronic device in a Superdome suite. The Saints are fighting back. They tell CNN, this report is 100 percent completely inaccurate. We\\'ve asked ESPN to provide us evidence to support their allegations and they refused. Former NFL quarterback, Dan Marino, is with us this morning. Nice to see you. DAN MARINO, FORMER NFL QUARTERBACK: Good to see you guys early this morning. O\\'BRIEN: So in addition to the bounty scandal that hit the Saints, now you have this new scandal, at least ESPN at this point is reporting. MARINO: Right. O\\'BRIEN: And have not yet come up with any exact proof yet. MARINO: You know, first of all, you\\'d hate to see that if that were the case. We don\\'t know if that\\'s true yet or not. With the bounty scandal and all that\\'s gone on for them, they\\'ve hit some hard times. So, you know, when things are going bad, more things come out sometimes. I would hate to think that Mickey Loomis would do something like that or be part of it. I personally don\\'t think he would. But, you know, as far as the bounty scandal is concerned, this thing happened. It\\'s disturbing from the standpoint of, you know, it\\'s a coach in a locker room trying to tell players to harm other players. And really the players, there\\'s a common bond. I mean, we all only have so long to play, you know. You hate to see this kind of thing going on in the league. O\\'BRIEN: How do you think it impacts the city, impacts the team, impacts the fans? MARINO: Well, you know, first of all, they\\'re a team that can go to the Super Bowl for sure. I mean, they have that kind of talent with Drew Brees, the quarterback. What they\\'ve done over the past few years, they won a Super Bowl. It\\'s going to hurt them a lot, not having Sean Payton. That communication between him and the quarterback, I mean, they\\'ve had that for three or four years. They kind of think the same, they\\'re working the same. That\\'s not going to be there for them. So it\\'s going to be tough on them to do what they have been doing the last few years as far as winning games and getting to the playoffs and maybe the Super Bowl. WILL CAIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Dan. The reaction from a lot of former players on the bounty scandal was, you\\'re being a little naive public. A lot of players were not surprised. I don\\'t know what your personal reaction was, but on this Mickey Loomis possible suspected accused of spying on other teams\\' coaches. You know, it reminds me of the spygate scandal. So when you see coaches push the limits like this, does it blow you out of the water? Are you surprised if it\\'s true? MARINO: No, I think teams have done it a little bit, but not to the extent, when this happened to the Patriots and Belichick, they were actually filming it and taking it back. I mean, there\\'s -- I\\'ve had guys on the sidelines -- other quarterbacks -- looking at, you know, another defensive coordinator giving signals, trying to maybe get a hint or stealing some signals just by visually looking at it, not taping signals. I mean, but it\\'s just -- I don\\'t think that in general, you know, teams are out there. They cheat or get an advantage or hurt another player. You know, as far as I was concerned, I used to give players incentives for touchdowns. Throw a touchdown over 40 yards, maybe we\\'d get a couple hundred bucks here or there. It was always fun. O\\'BRIEN: Positive reinforcement. MARINO: Yes, yes. O\\'BRIEN: Can we play a little word association? MARINO: OK. O\\'BRIEN: Ready? OK. Tim Tebow and the New York Jets. MARINO: What? What is the comment on that? You know what? I think they\\'re going to use him in different ways. I\\'m not sure that he\\'s going to be the type of player to be able to step right in and take over for Mark Sanchez, but 15, 20 plays a game, you know, he could help. They may use him in some special team\\'s roles and some other roles. O\\'BRIEN: Peyton Manning, the Broncos. MARINO: It\\'s going to be weird for Peyton because he\\'s played and he\\'s been a Colt and he\\'s had so much success there, but he\\'s -- O\\'BRIEN: They\\'re building the Indianapolis with his name on it. MARINO: Yes, he\\'s a competitor. I want to see the best for Peyton because he\\'s a friend and just one of the great quarterbacks of all time. For him to get another chance and maybe get a chance to go to a Super Bowl, I think that\\'s why. He went to Denver. CAIN: You never had to do that, right? You wore that Dolphins uniform until the very end. MARINO: I could have probably, you know, played another year. That would have been 18 years for me and decided not to. You know, playing 17 years one place was very unique. Elway did it. Peyton\\'s not going to get a chance for that now that he\\'s going to the Broncos. It was great for me. CAIN: What was that other uniform we might have seen you in? You said you had a chance. MARINO: Minnesota or Pittsburgh. They were both interested in me. JOHN FUGELSANG, POLITICAL COMEDIAN: Are those days completely gone? Do you think we\\'ll ever see someone having their entire career with one team? MARINO: Well, you know, I think maybe Tom Brady might be there. You know, Tom Brady, it\\'s going to be that kind of player. It has to be -- and the sad part, it would have been for Peyton Manning if he didn\\'t, you know, hurt his neck. O\\'BRIEN: Let me ask you a question about turning 50. You just turned 50 and you\\'re the life ambassador for AARP. MARINO: Yes, and it\\'s 50 is only a number, right? It\\'s only a number. It\\'s really about your attitude. O\\'BRIEN: It\\'s the new 30? MARINO: Yes. It\\'s about an attitude and doing some work with them. O\\'BRIEN: What are you doing for them? MARINO: On the web site, I\\'m going to have some videos and some tools where you can look for health and wellness for men and things you can do in your community. It\\'s going to be something we\\'re going to continue to make contributions on the web site. O\\'BRIEN: How\\'s your knee? When I was in college, you know, people used to talk about, I tore up my knee. They used to show me pictures of Dan Marino and say I\\'m getting the same brace as Dan Marino, OK. MARINO: Yes. My left knee is actually -- my legs are pretty good, but, you know, I\\'ve had a lot of surgeries. And we talked before we went on that I just tore a cartilage in my knee a couple weeks ago. O\\'BRIEN: Your left? MARINO: In my right knee. That\\'s my good knee. That\\'s my good knee. I think this story, you asked about AARP, is just new challenges in life. You\\'re at that age. Age is only a number and I\\'m going to help them with men\\'s fitness and health on their web site. O\\'BRIEN: Did you see that flagrant foul by Ron Artest? What\\'s his new name, Meta World Peace? MARINO: I didn\\'t see that. O\\'BRIEN: Do we have that? You guys want to play that? Right there. I think they\\'re going to play the close-up in a second. He\\'s, like, what? Does the dunk, celebrating. MARINO: That hurt. That hurt. CAIN: Was that an accident? MARINO: You know what? I think he -- no. Try and explain that one. That\\'s not good. Whatever it is, that\\'s not good. FUGELSANG: Can you blame that on testosterone? He felt the guy\\'s body right next to him. He knew there was a person there. MARINO: Basketball players, that\\'s their thing to rebound. Maybe that\\'s it. I don\\'t know. O\\'BRIEN: He\\'s not buying it at all. MARINO: That would upset me for sure. O\\'BRIEN: Dan Marino, it\\'s nice to have you. MARINO: Thanks. Appreciate it. O\\'BRIEN: Still ahead on STARTING POINT this morning, a tale of two sides. The new study says we all have a best side. We\\'ll tell you which is your best side, left or right, coming up. And misfire. A company accidentally tells every single employee it has in the entire world \"you\\'re fired,\" but they were not. From Christine\\'s playlist, Johnny Cash, \"A Boy Named Sue.\" You\\'re watching STARTING POINT. We\\'re back in a moment.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
