        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about finding the ratio of engineers to teachers given some ratios between engineers, doctors, and teachers. The ratio of engineers to doctors is 4:3, and the ratio of doctors to teachers is 5:6. I need to find the ratio of engineers to teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these ratios mean. The ratio of engineers to doctors is 4:3, which means for every 4 engineers, there are 3 doctors. Similarly, the ratio of doctors to teachers is 5:6, meaning for every 5 doctors, there are 6 teachers.\n\nNow, I need to find a way to relate engineers directly to teachers using these given ratios. Since both ratios involve doctors, maybe I can use doctors as a common term to link engineers and teachers.\n\nLet me denote the number of engineers as E, the number of doctors as D, and the number of teachers as T.\n\nFrom the first ratio, E:D = 4:3. This can be written as E/D = 4/3.\n\nFrom the second ratio, D:T = 5:6. This can be written as D/T = 5/6.\n\nI need to find E:T, which is E/T.\n\nTo find E/T, I can use the two equations I have:\n\nE/D = 4/3 and D/T = 5/6.\n\nIf I multiply these two equations together, I can eliminate D:\n\n(E/D) * (D/T) = (4/3) * (5/6)\n\nThe D's cancel out, so:\n\nE/T = (4*5)/(3*6) = 20/18\n\nNow, I can simplify 20/18 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n20 \u00f7 2 = 10\n\n18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n\nSo, E/T = 10/9.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of engineers to teachers is 10:9.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I multiplied the two ratios together to get E/T directly. That seems correct, but maybe I should approach it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to do this is to find a common multiple for the number of doctors in both ratios. Let's see.\n\nFrom E:D = 4:3, and D:T = 5:6.\n\nFirst, I need to make the number of doctors in both ratios the same. The number of doctors in the first ratio is 3 parts, and in the second ratio, it's 5 parts. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15.\n\nSo, I can adjust the ratios to have 15 doctors in both.\n\nFor E:D = 4:3, to make D=15, I multiply both sides by 5:\n\nE:D = (4*5):(3*5) = 20:15.\n\nFor D:T = 5:6, to make D=15, I multiply both sides by 3:\n\nD:T = (5*3):(6*3) = 15:18.\n\nNow, both ratios have 15 doctors. So, the number of engineers is 20, and the number of teachers is 18.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of engineers to teachers is 20:18, which simplifies to 10:9.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier. So, the ratio of engineers to teachers is indeed 10:9.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using variables.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the number of doctors is D.\n\nThen, from E:D = 4:3, E = (4/3)D.\n\nFrom D:T = 5:6, T = (6/5)D.\n\nNow, E:T = (4/3)D : (6/5)D.\n\nThe D's cancel out: E:T = (4/3) : (6/5).\n\nTo simplify this, I can divide both parts by 6/5:\n\n(4/3) \u00f7 (6/5) = (4/3)*(5/6) = 20/18 = 10/9.\n\nSo again, the ratio is 10:9.\n\nAlternatively, I can write E:T = (4/3)D : (6/5)D = (4/3)/(6/5) = (4/3)*(5/6) = 20/18 = 10/9.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think this is solid. But to be extra sure, let me consider actual numbers.\n\nSuppose there are 15 doctors (since we used 15 earlier).\n\nThen, E = (4/3)*15 = 20 engineers.\n\nAnd T = (6/5)*15 = 18 teachers.\n\nSo, E:T = 20:18 = 10:9.\n\nYep, that works.\n\nAlternatively, if there are 30 doctors,\n\nE = (4/3)*30 = 40 engineers.\n\nT = (6/5)*30 = 36 teachers.\n\nRatio is 40:36 = 10:9.\n\nSame again.\n\nOr, if there are 150 doctors,\n\nE = (4/3)*150 = 200 engineers.\n\nT = (6/5)*150 = 180 teachers.\n\nRatio is 200:180 = 10:9.\n\nConsistent.\n\nI think no matter what multiple I choose for the number of doctors, the ratio of engineers to teachers will always simplify to 10:9.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of engineers to teachers is 10:9.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret these ratios. It seems straightforward once I find a common term and adjust the ratios accordingly.\n\nOne thing to watch out for is making sure that the ratios are set up correctly and that I'm consistent with the terms. In this case, doctors are common to both ratios, so aligning them properly is key.\n\nAnother potential pitfall is simplifying the ratio incorrectly, but 20:18 simplifies to 10:9, which is correct.\n\nI can also check if there's a formulaic approach to combining ratios. I recall that to combine two ratios A:B and B:C to find A:C, you can multiply A/B by B/C to get A/C.\n\nIn this case, E/D * D/T = E/T.\n\nWhich is what I did: (4/3) * (5/6) = 20/18 = 10/9.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the method.\n\nAlternatively, you can write E = (4/3)D and T = (6/5)D, then E/T = (4/3)D / (6/5)D = (4/3)/(6/5) = (4/3)*(5/6) = 20/18 = 10/9.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The answer should be 10:9.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the ratios were different. Suppose E:D = 2:3 and D:T = 4:5.\n\nThen, to find E:T, I would first find a common multiple for D.\n\nE:D = 2:3, and D:T = 4:5.\n\nThe LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nSo, adjust E:D to E:D = (2*4):(3*4) = 8:12.\n\nAnd D:T to D:T = (4*3):(5*3) = 12:15.\n\nNow, E:T = 8:15.\n\nAlternatively, E/T = (2/3)D : (5/4)D = (2/3)/(5/4) = (2/3)*(4/5) = 8/15.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, the method holds for different ratios as well.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the ratio of engineers to teachers is 10:9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10:9} \\]"
