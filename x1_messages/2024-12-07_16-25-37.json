        "content": "Alright, so I've got this task here. The user wants to find out how many times the word 'apple' is mentioned in a text file. They've provided me with two functions to choose from: text_analytics and csv_analytics. I need to pick the most suitable one and figure out the right parameters to use.\n\nFirst, let's look at what each function does.\n\nThe text_analytics function is described as helping in analyzing textual data for specific words or phrases. It has parameters for action and word. The actions mentioned are \"count\" and \"filter,\" but I suspect there might be more options, but for now, these are what's provided.\n\nThe csv_analytics function, on the other hand, is designed for performing various aggregations and counts on CSV data. It has parameters for action, filters, and within filters, there are options for column, value, and expression.\n\nGiven that the user is working with a text file and wants to count occurrences of a specific word, 'apple', I think the text_analytics function is the way to go. The csv_analytics function seems more suited for tabular data in CSV format, which doesn't match the scenario here.\n\nSo, I'll choose text_analytics.\n\nNow, within text_analytics, I need to specify the action and the word.\n\nThe action should be \"count\" since the user wants to know how many times 'apple' is mentioned.\n\nThe word parameter should be set to 'apple'.\n\nSo, putting this together in YAML format, it should look something like this:\n\n```\n\nfunction: text_analytics\n\nparams:\n\n  action: count\n\n  word: apple\n\n```\n\nWait a minute, but I realize that the user is referring to a text file. Does that mean the function needs to know which file to read from? Looking back at the provided functions, neither of them mentions anything about specifying a file path or name.\n\nHmm, this could be a problem. Maybe I need to assume that the text file is already loaded or that the function can take a file parameter that wasn't listed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function operates on a predefined text source, but that seems less likely.\n\nGiven the information provided, I'll proceed with the assumption that text_analytics can handle the text file, and the user has already set up the connection to the file.\n\nSo, my final answer in YAML format is:\n\nfunction: text_analytics\n\nparams:\n\naction: count\n\nword: apple"
