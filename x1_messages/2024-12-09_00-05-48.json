        "content": "So I've got this expression to simplify: (2x\u00b2y)^3 * (3xy\u00b2)^2. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have an exponent outside of parentheses, it applies to everything inside those parentheses. So, first things first, I need to handle those exponents.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, (2x\u00b2y)^3. That means I need to raise everything inside the parentheses to the power of 3. So, that's 2^3 * (x\u00b2)^3 * y^3.\n\nSimilarly, (3xy\u00b2)^2 means 3^2 * x^2 * (y\u00b2)^2.\n\nAlright, let's calculate each part.\n\nStarting with (2x\u00b2y)^3:\n\n- 2^3 is 8.\n\n- (x\u00b2)^3 is x^(2*3) = x^6.\n\n- y^3 is y^3.\n\nSo, (2x\u00b2y)^3 = 8x^6y^3.\n\nNow, (3xy\u00b2)^2:\n\n- 3^2 is 9.\n\n- x^2 is x^2.\n\n- (y\u00b2)^2 is y^(2*2) = y^4.\n\nSo, (3xy\u00b2)^2 = 9x^2y^4.\n\nNow, I need to multiply these two results together: 8x^6y^3 * 9x^2y^4.\n\nFirst, multiply the coefficients: 8 * 9 = 72.\n\nThen, for the x terms: x^6 * x^2 = x^(6+2) = x^8.\n\nAnd for the y terms: y^3 * y^4 = y^(3+4) = y^7.\n\nPutting it all together, that's 72x^8y^7.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Are there any like terms or anything like that? Nope, this seems straightforward.\n\nLet me double-check my exponents:\n\n- For x: 6 + 2 = 8, that's correct.\n\n- For y: 3 + 4 = 7, that's also correct.\n\nAnd 8 * 9 is indeed 72.\n\nSo, the simplified expression should be 72x^8y^7.\n\nI think that's it. Unless there's a mistake in my calculations, this should be the simplified form of the given expression.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72x^{8}y^{7}} \\]"
