        "content": "So I have this problem here: If you invest $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 6% compounded quarterly, how much money will you have after 3 years? Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money, so that's $10,000.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 6%, but I need to write that as a decimal, so that's 0.06.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded quarterly, that means four times a year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 3 years.\n\nSo, plugging in these values into the formula:\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.06/4)^(4*3)\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n\n0.06 / 4 = 0.015\n\nSo, each quarter, the interest rate is 1.5%.\n\nNext, add 1 to this quarterly interest rate:\n\n1 + 0.015 = 1.015\n\nNow, raise this to the power of the total number of quarters in 3 years. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, in 3 years there are:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 quarters\n\nSo, I need to calculate 1.015 raised to the 12th power.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.015^12\n\nI can use a calculator for this. 1.015 to the power of 12 is approximately 1.195618.\n\nNow, multiply this by the principal amount:\n\n10000 * 1.195618 = 11956.18\n\nSo, after 3 years, the amount of money accumulated would be approximately $11,956.18.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the formula again:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nP = 10000\n\nr = 0.06\n\nn = 4\n\nt = 3\n\nSo, A = 10000(1 + 0.06/4)^(4*3)\n\nAs I did before, 0.06/4 = 0.015\n\nThen, 1 + 0.015 = 1.015\n\nThen, 1.015 raised to the 12th power is about 1.195618\n\nThen, 10000 * 1.195618 = 11956.18\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it this way: compound interest means that interest is earned on the accumulated interest over time. So, each quarter, the interest is calculated on the current balance, which includes previous interest.\n\nLet me verify this with a smaller number of periods to see if it makes sense.\n\nSuppose I have $1000 at 20% interest compounded annually for 2 years.\n\nUsing the formula: A = 1000(1 + 0.20/1)^(1*2) = 1000(1.2)^2 = 1000*1.44 = $1440\n\nAlternatively, year 1: 1000 + 20% of 1000 = 1000 + 200 = 1200\n\nYear 2: 1200 + 20% of 1200 = 1200 + 240 = 1440\n\nSame result.\n\nNow, if it's compounded semi-annually, say 10% every half-year:\n\nA = 1000(1 + 0.20/2)^(2*2) = 1000(1.1)^4 = 1000*1.4641 = $1464.10\n\nWhich is more than the annual compounding, as expected.\n\nSo, back to the original problem, $10,000 at 6% compounded quarterly for 3 years.\n\nI calculated A = 10000*(1.015)^12 = 10000*1.195618 = 11956.18\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the interest earned each quarter and add it up, but that would be more time-consuming.\n\nLet me try that to verify.\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nInterest = 10000 * 0.015 = 150\n\nNew balance = 10000 + 150 = 10150\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nInterest = 10150 * 0.015 = 152.25\n\nNew balance = 10150 + 152.25 = 10302.25\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nInterest = 10302.25 * 0.015 = 154.53375\n\nNew balance = 10302.25 + 154.53375 \u2248 10456.78\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nInterest = 10456.78 * 0.015 \u2248 156.85\n\nNew balance \u2248 10456.78 + 156.85 \u2248 10613.63\n\nYear 1 total: \u2248 10613.63\n\nContinuing this for 3 years would be tedious, but if I do it for all 12 quarters, I should get the same result as the formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can trust the formula, as it's been derived precisely for this purpose.\n\nSo, after 3 years, the investment would grow to approximately $11,956.18.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like inflation or taxes, but the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I assume it's just straightforward compound interest.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the interest rate is indeed 6% per year, compounded quarterly, and not something else.\n\nYes, the problem states annual interest rate of 6% compounded quarterly.\n\nAlternatively, if it were simple interest, the calculation would be different.\n\nWith simple interest, the interest is not compounded; it's just calculated on the principal each year.\n\nSo, for simple interest, the formula is A = P + (P*r*t) = P(1 + rt)\n\nIn this case, A = 10000(1 + 0.06*3) = 10000(1.18) = $11,800\n\nBut since it's compounded quarterly, the amount is higher, as expected.\n\nSo, to summarize, with compound interest, A = 11,956.18, and with simple interest, A = 11,800.\n\nThe difference is due to the compounding effect.\n\nTherefore, the final amount after 3 years with quarterly compounding is approximately $11,956.18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11956.18} \\]"
