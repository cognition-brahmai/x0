        "content": "So the library has 500 books in total. Out of these, 30% are fiction books, and the rest are non-fiction. I need to find out how many non-fiction books there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many fiction books there are. Since 30% of the books are fiction, I can calculate that by taking 30% of 500.\n\nTo calculate 30% of 500, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 30% is the same as 0.30. So, 0.30 times 500 equals 150. So, there are 150 fiction books.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-fiction books, I can subtract the number of fiction books from the total number of books. That is, 500 minus 150 equals 350.\n\nSo, there are 350 non-fiction books in the library.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of non-fiction books.\n\nSince 30% are fiction, the remaining percentage must be non-fiction. So, 100% minus 30% equals 70%. Therefore, 70% of the books are non-fiction.\n\nNow, to find 70% of 500, I can again convert the percentage to a decimal. 70% is 0.70. So, 0.70 times 500 equals 350.\n\nAgain, I get 350 non-fiction books. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst method:\n\n30% of 500:\n\n0.30 \u00d7 500 = 150 fiction books\n\nTotal books minus fiction books:\n\n500 - 150 = 350 non-fiction books\n\nSecond method:\n\n70% of 500:\n\n0.70 \u00d7 500 = 350 non-fiction books\n\nBoth methods confirm that there are 350 non-fiction books in the library.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to verify this.\n\nSuppose I assume that the number of non-fiction books is indeed 350, and I add that to the number of fiction books, which is 150. So, 350 plus 150 equals 500, which matches the total number of books in the library. That seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use proportions. If 30% are fiction, then for every 100 books, 30 are fiction and 70 are non-fiction. So, for 500 books, which is five times 100, the number of non-fiction books would be five times 70, which is 350.\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems consistent across different methods.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem is straightforward once I break it down like this. Sometimes percentages can be tricky, but in this case, it's pretty straightforward.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other type of books that might be included besides fiction and non-fiction. The problem says that the rest of the books are non-fiction, implying that all books are either fiction or non-fiction, with no other categories. So, no need to account for any other types.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not misinterpreting the percentage. 30% of 500 is indeed 150, and 70% of 500 is 350. I can do a quick mental math: 10% of 500 is 50, so 30% is 150, and 70% is 350. That checks out.\n\nI feel confident that the answer is 350 non-fiction books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{350} \\]"
