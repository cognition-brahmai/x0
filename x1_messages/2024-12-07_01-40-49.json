        "content": "Let's break this down. So, there are four friends who ordered four different dishes, each costing $12. That means the total cost for the dishes is 4 dishes times $12 each, right? So, 4 times 12 is 48 dollars.\n\nNext, they ordered two bottles of water, each costing $2. So, the total for the water is 2 times 2, which is 4 dollars.\n\nNow, to find the total bill, we add the cost of the dishes and the cost of the water: 48 plus 4 equals 52 dollars.\n\nSince they want to split the bill equally among the four friends, we need to divide the total bill by 4. So, 52 divided by 4 is 13 dollars.\n\nTherefore, each friend should pay $13.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Dishes: 4 times 12 is 48. Water: 2 times 2 is 4. Total: 48 plus 4 is 52. Divided by 4 is 13. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe if one friend didn't want water, but the question says they ordered two bottles of water, so probably they all shared them. Since they're splitting the bill equally, it shouldn't matter what each person ordered, just the total cost divided equally.\n\nSo, each friend pays $13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
