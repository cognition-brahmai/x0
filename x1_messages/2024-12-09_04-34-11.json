        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. John starts with 20 apples.\n\nFirst, he gives half of his apples to Jane. Half of 20 is 10, so he gives 10 apples to Jane. Now, John has 20 - 10 = 10 apples left.\n\nNext, he eats 2 apples himself. So, he has 10 - 2 = 8 apples remaining.\n\nThen, he finds 5 more apples. Adding those to his current total, he now has 8 + 5 = 13 apples.\n\nFinally, he gives a third of his remaining apples to Sam. A third of 13 is 13 / 3, which is approximately 4.333, but since we're dealing with whole apples, we need to consider if he gives away 4 or 5 apples. However, in mathematical terms, without specifying rounding, we should keep it as 13/3.\n\nBut for the sake of this problem, let's assume we're dealing with whole apples, and he gives away 4 apples (since 13 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 1).\n\nSo, he gives away 4 apples to Sam, leaving him with 13 - 4 = 9 apples.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider giving away exactly one-third, which is 13/3 \u2248 4.333 apples, but since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we might need to round down to 4 apples or up to 5 apples. But typically, giving a third would mean giving away 4 apples and leaving him with 9.\n\nWait a minute, but 4 is not exactly a third of 13. Let's see:\n\nOne-third of 13 is 13/3 \u2248 4.333, but since we can't split apples into fractions, perhaps the problem expects us to give away 4 apples (the integer part) and leave him with 9 apples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should consider giving away 5 apples, which is closer to a third, but that would leave him with 8 apples.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's consider that when he gives away a third of his remaining apples, he gives away exactly one-third, and since apples must be whole, we need to see how that works.\n\nHe has 13 apples. One-third of 13 is 13/3, which is 4 and 1/3 apples. But since he can't give away a fraction of an apple, perhaps he gives away 4 apples and has 9 left, or gives away 5 apples and has 8 left.\n\nI think the most straightforward approach is to assume he gives away 4 apples (since 4 is the integer part of 13 divided by 3), leaving him with 9 apples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that he gives away the exact one-third and has the remaining apples, possibly involving fractions, but since apples are discrete items, it's tricky.\n\nBut in the context of a word problem, especially if it's for grade school, it's likely that they expect us to deal with whole numbers.\n\nSo, starting again:\n\nJohn has 20 apples.\n\nGives half to Jane: 20 / 2 = 10 apples to Jane. Now he has 10 apples left.\n\nEats 2 apples: 10 - 2 = 8 apples.\n\nFinds 5 more apples: 8 + 5 = 13 apples.\n\nGives a third of his remaining apples to Sam: 13 / 3 = 4.333... Since he can't give away a fraction of an apple, he probably gives away 4 apples.\n\nTherefore, he has 13 - 4 = 9 apples left.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that he gives away 5 apples (rounding up), he would have 13 - 5 = 8 apples left.\n\nBut giving away 4 apples is closer to one-third than giving away 5, since 4 is 12/3 and 5 is 15/3.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, 4 is 12/3, which is less than 13/3, and 5 is 15/3, which is more than 13/3.\n\nSo giving away 4 apples is giving away slightly less than one-third, and giving away 5 apples is giving away slightly more.\n\nBut since one-third is approximately 4.333, giving away 4 apples is closer to one-third than giving away 5.\n\nTherefore, it's more accurate to say he gives away 4 apples and has 9 left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the exact fraction and subtract accordingly.\n\nIn that case, he gives away 13/3 apples to Sam, which is approximately 4.333 apples.\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to decide how to handle this.\n\nPerhaps the problem assumes that he gives away exactly 13/3 apples, and we should subtract that from his total.\n\nSo, apples left would be 13 - 13/3 = (39/3 - 13/3) = 26/3 apples, which is approximately 8.666 apples.\n\nBut again, since apples are whole items, this doesn't make complete sense.\n\nMaybe the problem is designed to make us think about fractions, but if it's a problem for young students, it might be expecting whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that he gives away 4 apples (the integer part of 13/3) and has 9 apples left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he gives away 4 apples to Sam and has 9 apples left, acknowledging that 4 is not exactly one-third but is the closest whole number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that he gives away 4 apples (one-third rounded down) and has 9 apples left.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the most reasonable answer is that John has 9 apples left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
