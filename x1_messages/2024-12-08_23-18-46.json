        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a movie theater. It says there are 15 rows of seats, and each row has 12 seats. The theater is two-thirds full, and I need to find out how many seats are occupied. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of seats in the theater. Since there are 15 rows and each row has 12 seats, I can multiply those two numbers to get the total seats. So, 15 times 12. Let's see, 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 2 is 30, so adding those together, 150 plus 30 equals 180. So, there are 180 seats in total.\n\nNow, the theater is two-thirds full. That means that two-thirds of the total seats are occupied. So, I need to find two-thirds of 180. To do that, I can first find one-third of 180 and then multiply by 2.\n\nLet's find one-third of 180. Dividing 180 by 3, that's straightforward. 3 times 60 is 180, so one-third is 60. Now, since we need two-thirds, I'll multiply 60 by 2, which gives 120.\n\nSo, 120 seats are occupied. But just to make sure, maybe I'll check this another way. Another way to find two-thirds of 180 is to multiply 180 by 2/3 directly.\n\nSo, 180 times 2/3. First, I can multiply 180 by 2, which is 360, and then divide by 3. 360 divided by 3 is 120. Same answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in decimals. Two-thirds is approximately 0.6667. So, 180 times 0.6667 should also give me around 120. Let's quickly do that: 180 times 0.6667 is 120.006, which rounds to 120.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I keep getting 120 as the number of occupied seats. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I'll consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. For example, is there any chance that the seating arrangement affects the number of occupied seats? The problem says each row has 12 seats, and there are 15 rows, so total seats are 180. If the theater is two-thirds full, it should be 120 seats occupied, as I calculated.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here or any additional factors to consider. It seems like a straightforward problem about fractions and multiplication.\n\nOne more thing: maybe I should check if there's a way to verify this in a real-world scenario. Suppose I was at a movie theater with 15 rows of 12 seats each, totaling 180 seats. If the theater is two-thirds full, I would expect about 120 seats to be occupied. That seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about smaller numbers, say, a theater with 3 rows of 4 seats each, totaling 12 seats. If it's two-thirds full, that would be 8 seats occupied. Similarly, 15 rows of 12 seats are 180 seats, and two-thirds of that is 120. It scales up proportionally.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 120 seats are occupied.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
