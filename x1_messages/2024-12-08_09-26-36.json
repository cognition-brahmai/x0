        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a publishing company that wants to print a limited edition of a popular novel with special features. The production cost per book is $15, and they plan to sell each copy for $50. There are also additional costs like marketing expenses of $10,000 and author royalties, which are 10% of the sale price. I need to calculate the minimum number of books that need to be sold to break even on this project. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what break-even means. Break-even is when the total revenue equals the total costs. So, I need to find the point where the money coming in equals the money going out. That makes sense.\n\nNow, let's identify all the costs involved. There are production costs per book, marketing expenses, and author royalties.\n\nThe production cost per book is $15. So, if they print 'x' number of books, the total production cost would be 15x dollars.\n\nMarketing expenses are a fixed cost of $10,000. These don't change with the number of books printed.\n\nAuthor royalties are 10% of the sale price per book. The sale price is $50, so royalties per book would be 10% of 50, which is $5 per book. So, for 'x' books, the total royalties would be 5x dollars.\n\nSo, the total cost (TC) would be the sum of production costs, marketing expenses, and royalties:\n\nTC = 15x + 10,000 + 5x\n\nCombining like terms, that's:\n\nTC = (15x + 5x) + 10,000 = 20x + 10,000\n\nNext, the total revenue (TR) is the selling price per book times the number of books sold. So, if they sell 'x' books at $50 each:\n\nTR = 50x\n\nNow, to break even, TR must equal TC:\n\n50x = 20x + 10,000\n\nTo find 'x', I'll subtract 20x from both sides:\n\n50x - 20x = 10,000\n\n30x = 10,000\n\nNow, divide both sides by 30:\n\nx = 10,000 / 30\n\nx \u2248 333.333...\n\nSince you can't sell a fraction of a book, they need to sell at least 334 books to break even.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me verify the costs:\n\n- Production cost: $15 per book\n\n- Royalties: 10% of $50 = $5 per book\n\n- So, variable cost per book is 15 + 5 = $20 per book\n\n- Fixed costs: $10,000 for marketing\n\nSo, total cost: TC = 20x + 10,000\n\nTotal revenue: TR = 50x\n\nSet TR = TC:\n\n50x = 20x + 10,000\n\nSubtract 20x from both sides:\n\n30x = 10,000\n\nDivide by 30:\n\nx = 10,000 / 30 \u2248 333.333...\n\nYes, rounding up to 334 books.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's calculate the profit at 333 and 334 books.\n\nProfit = TR - TC\n\nAt x = 333:\n\nTR = 50 * 333 = 16,650\n\nTC = 20 * 333 + 10,000 = 6,660 + 10,000 = 16,660\n\nProfit = 16,650 - 16,660 = -10\n\nSo, still a loss of $10.\n\nAt x = 334:\n\nTR = 50 * 334 = 16,700\n\nTC = 20 * 334 + 10,000 = 6,680 + 10,000 = 16,680\n\nProfit = 16,700 - 16,680 = 20\n\nSo, at 334 books, they start making a profit of $20.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of books needed to break even is indeed 334.\n\nI think that's the answer. But maybe I should consider if there are any other costs that I might have missed. For example, are there any distribution costs, taxes, or other expenses that might be applicable? The problem doesn't mention any other costs beyond production, marketing, and royalties, so I think it's safe to assume that's all.\n\nAlso, I assumed that all the books printed are sold, which might not be the case in reality, but for the purpose of this break-even analysis, we're focusing on the number of books that need to be sold to cover the costs.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the royalties are based on the sale price or the cost price. In this case, it says \"author royalties (10% of the sale price)\", so it's 10% of $50, which is $5 per book.\n\nWait, does the royalty come out of the selling price, or is it in addition to the production cost? I think it's typically a percentage of the selling price, which means it's already factored into the selling price. But in this problem, it's stated as a separate cost.\n\nSo, in that case, the cost structure would include production cost per book, plus royalties per book, plus fixed marketing expenses.\n\nYes, that's how I approached it.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes royalties are considered as a reduction in profit rather than an additional cost. But based on the problem statement, it seems like it's an additional cost to be included in TC.\n\nGiven that, my earlier calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the minimum number of books needed to break even is 334.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{334} \\]"
