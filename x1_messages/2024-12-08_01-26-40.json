        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, we've got an e-commerce company with three warehouses: one in New York, one in Los Angeles, and one in Chicago. Each warehouse has different average shipping costs per package, and the company ships a certain percentage of its packages from each location. Our tasks are to calculate the total daily shipping cost and determine which warehouse contributes the most to the overall shipping expenses.\n\nFirst, let's gather all the given data:\n\n- Shipping cost per package:\n\n  - New York: $8\n\n  - Los Angeles: $10\n\n  - Chicago: $7\n\n- Total packages shipped daily: 500\n\n- Percentage of packages from each warehouse:\n\n  - New York: 60%\n\n  - Los Angeles: 25%\n\n  - Chicago: 15%\n\nAlright, to find the total daily shipping cost, I think we need to calculate the shipping cost for each warehouse separately and then sum them up. To do that, we'll first find out how many packages each warehouse ships daily, based on the percentages given, and then multiply those numbers by the respective shipping costs.\n\nLet's start with New York:\n\n- Percentage of packages from New York: 60%\n\n- Number of packages from New York: 60% of 500\n\n  - Calculating that: (60/100) * 500 = 0.6 * 500 = 300 packages\n\n- Shipping cost per package from New York: $8\n\n- Total shipping cost from New York: 300 packages * $8/package = $2400\n\nNext, Los Angeles:\n\n- Percentage of packages from Los Angeles: 25%\n\n- Number of packages from Los Angeles: 25% of 500\n\n  - Calculating that: (25/100) * 500 = 0.25 * 500 = 125 packages\n\n- Shipping cost per package from Los Angeles: $10\n\n- Total shipping cost from Los Angeles: 125 packages * $10/package = $1250\n\nNow, Chicago:\n\n- Percentage of packages from Chicago: 15%\n\n- Number of packages from Chicago: 15% of 500\n\n  - Calculating that: (15/100) * 500 = 0.15 * 500 = 75 packages\n\n- Shipping cost per package from Chicago: $7\n\n- Total shipping cost from Chicago: 75 packages * $7/package = $525\n\nNow, to find the total daily shipping cost, we'll add up the shipping costs from all three warehouses:\n\nTotal daily shipping cost = New York cost + Los Angeles cost + Chicago cost\n\n= $2400 + $1250 + $525\n\nLet's add those up:\n\n$2400 + $1250 = $3650\n\n$3650 + $525 = $4175\n\nSo, the total daily shipping cost is $4175.\n\nNow, to find out which warehouse has the highest contribution to the overall shipping expenses, we can look at the total shipping cost from each warehouse that we've already calculated:\n\n- New York: $2400\n\n- Los Angeles: $1250\n\n- Chicago: $525\n\nComparing these amounts, it's clear that New York has the highest total shipping cost at $2400.\n\nAlternatively, if by \"contribution\" they mean the percentage of the total shipping cost that each warehouse contributes, we can calculate that as well. But since the question asks for \"which warehouse has the highest contribution to the overall shipping expenses,\" and we've already identified that New York has the highest absolute dollar amount, it's safe to conclude that New York has the highest contribution.\n\nBut for completeness, let's calculate the percentage contribution of each warehouse to the total shipping cost.\n\nFirst, we'll use the total daily shipping cost, which is $4175.\n\nThen, for each warehouse:\n\n- New York's contribution percentage: ($2400 / $4175) * 100%\n\n  - Calculating that: 2400 divided by 4175 is approximately 0.574\n\n  - 0.574 * 100% = 57.4%\n\n- Los Angeles's contribution percentage: ($1250 / $4175) * 100%\n\n  - 1250 / 4175 \u2248 0.300\n\n  - 0.300 * 100% = 30.0%\n\n- Chicago's contribution percentage: ($525 / $4175) * 100%\n\n  - 525 / 4175 \u2248 0.126\n\n  - 0.126 * 100% = 12.6%\n\nSo, in terms of percentage contribution, New York still has the highest share at 57.4%, followed by Los Angeles at 30.0%, and Chicago at 12.6%.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether we look at absolute dollars or percentage of the total, New York has the highest contribution to the overall shipping expenses.\n\nJust to double-check our calculations:\n\n- Total packages: 500\n\n- New York: 60% of 500 = 300 packages * $8 = $2400\n\n- Los Angeles: 25% of 500 = 125 packages * $10 = $1250\n\n- Chicago: 15% of 500 = 75 packages * $7 = $525\n\n- Total: $2400 + $1250 + $525 = $4175\n\n- New York's percentage: $2400 / $4175 \u2248 57.4%\n\n- Los Angeles's percentage: $1250 / $4175 \u2248 30.0%\n\n- Chicago's percentage: $525 / $4175 \u2248 12.6%\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly.\n\nI think that's the complete answer. The total daily shipping cost is $4175, and New York has the highest contribution to the overall shipping expenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4175} \\]"
