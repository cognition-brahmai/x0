        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got an office building with 18 floors. Each floor has 12 rooms, and each room has 4 windows. We need to find out how many windows there are in the entire building.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many windows are on one floor. Since each floor has 12 rooms and each room has 4 windows, I can multiply the number of rooms by the number of windows per room to get the total number of windows per floor.\n\nSo, windows per floor = number of rooms per floor \u00d7 number of windows per room\n\nThat would be:\n\nWindows per floor = 12 rooms \u00d7 4 windows = 48 windows\n\nOkay, so there are 48 windows on each floor.\n\nNow, since there are 18 floors in the building, I need to find out how many windows there are in total across all floors. To do that, I can multiply the number of windows per floor by the total number of floors.\n\nTotal windows = windows per floor \u00d7 number of floors\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal windows = 48 windows \u00d7 18 floors\n\nHmm, let's calculate that.\n\n48 \u00d7 18...\n\nI know that 48 \u00d7 10 = 480, and 48 \u00d7 8 = 384. So, if I add those together, 480 + 384 = 864.\n\nTherefore, the total number of windows in the entire building is 864.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of rooms in the building first. Since there are 18 floors and each floor has 12 rooms, the total number of rooms is:\n\nTotal rooms = number of floors \u00d7 number of rooms per floor\n\nTotal rooms = 18 floors \u00d7 12 rooms = 216 rooms\n\nNow, if each room has 4 windows, then the total number of windows would be:\n\nTotal windows = total rooms \u00d7 number of windows per room\n\nTotal windows = 216 rooms \u00d7 4 windows = 864 windows\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, it looks like 864 is the correct total number of windows in the building.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider if there are any other factors that might affect the total number of windows. For example, are there any windows that are not associated with rooms, like windows in hallways or common areas? But based on the problem statement, it seems that all windows are associated with the rooms, as each room has 4 windows.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any floors that might have fewer rooms or windows, but the problem says that each floor has 12 rooms with 4 windows each, so it's consistent across all floors.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether some rooms might have fewer or more windows, but again, the problem states that each room has 4 windows, so I can assume uniformity.\n\nSo, overall, my calculation seems solid. The total number of windows in the building is 864.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{864} \\]"
