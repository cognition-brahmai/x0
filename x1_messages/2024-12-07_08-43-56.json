        "content": "So I've got this problem here about bacteria doubling every 3 hours. Starting with 100 bacteria, I need to figure out how many there will be after 36 hours. Hmm, exponential growth, right? I remember that exponential growth can be modeled with a formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept. Bacteria doubling means that every 3 hours, the number of bacteria doubles. So, starting with 100, after 3 hours it becomes 200, then after another 3 hours (so 6 hours total), it becomes 400, and so on. It's multiplying by 2 every 3 hours.\n\nI think the general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N(t) \\) is the amount at time \\( t \\),\n\n- \\( N_0 \\) is the initial amount,\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time elapsed,\n\n- \\( T \\) is the doubling time.\n\nIn this case, \\( N_0 = 100 \\), \\( T = 3 \\) hours, and \\( t = 36 \\) hours.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times 2^{(36/3)} \\]\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n\\[ 36 / 3 = 12 \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times 2^{12} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 2^{12} \\). Let's see:\n\n\\[ 2^1 = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^5 = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^6 = 64 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^8 = 256 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^9 = 512 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{10} = 1024 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{11} = 2048 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{12} = 4096 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\).\n\nNow, multiply by the initial amount:\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times 4096 = 409,600 \\]\n\nWait, that seems really big. Is there a mistake here? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting with 100 bacteria, doubling every 3 hours:\n\n- After 3 hours: 100 \u00d7 2 = 200\n\n- After 6 hours: 200 \u00d7 2 = 400\n\n- After 9 hours: 400 \u00d7 2 = 800\n\n- After 12 hours: 800 \u00d7 2 = 1600\n\n- After 15 hours: 1600 \u00d7 2 = 3200\n\n- After 18 hours: 3200 \u00d7 2 = 6400\n\n- After 21 hours: 6400 \u00d7 2 = 12,800\n\n- After 24 hours: 12,800 \u00d7 2 = 25,600\n\n- After 27 hours: 25,600 \u00d7 2 = 51,200\n\n- After 30 hours: 51,200 \u00d7 2 = 102,400\n\n- After 33 hours: 102,400 \u00d7 2 = 204,800\n\n- After 36 hours: 204,800 \u00d7 2 = 409,600\n\nOkay, so my initial calculation seems correct. But is there another way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, I could use the exponential growth formula with base e:\n\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 \\times e^{(k \\times t)} \\]\n\nWhere \\( k \\) is the growth rate.\n\nFirst, I need to find \\( k \\). I know that the population doubles every 3 hours, so:\n\n\\[ 2N_0 = N_0 \\times e^{(k \\times 3)} \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( N_0 \\):\n\n\\[ 2 = e^{(k \\times 3)} \\]\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(2) = k \\times 3 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3} \\]\n\nNow, plug \\( k \\) back into the formula:\n\n\\[ N(t) = 100 \\times e^{(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{3} \\times 36)} \\]\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3} \\times 36 = \\ln(2) \\times 12 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times e^{(\\ln(2) \\times 12)} \\]\n\nI know that \\( e^{\\ln(2) \\times 12} = (e^{\\ln(2)})^{12} = 2^{12} = 4096 \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times 4096 = 409,600 \\]\n\nOkay, this matches my previous calculation. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of the number of doubling periods in 36 hours.\n\nSince the bacteria double every 3 hours, the number of doubling periods in 36 hours is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{36}{3} = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the population multiplies by \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times 4096 = 409,600 \\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that the bacteria don't double exactly every 3 hours, or that other factors affect the growth? For example, maybe resources are limited, or perhaps the bacteria have a limited growth phase. But the problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so I'll assume ideal conditions for exponential growth.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the rule of 70, which is used to estimate doubling time, but I think that's more applicable for continuous growth rates and might not be directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the generation time. The generation time \\( g \\) is the time it takes for the population to double, which is given as 3 hours.\n\nThe formula for exponential growth in terms of generation time is:\n\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/g)} \\]\n\nWhich is the same as the first formula I used.\n\nSo, plugging in the values again:\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times 2^{(36/3)} = 100 \\times 2^{12} = 409,600 \\]\n\nConsistent with previous calculations.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the doubling time was different or if the time period wasn't a multiple of the doubling time. But in this case, 36 hours is exactly 12 doubling periods of 3 hours each, so no need to adjust for partial periods.\n\nI should also consider units. The initial population is 100 bacteria, and time is in hours. The question asks for the population after 36 hours, which is within the realm of bacterial growth rates, as bacteria can indeed double every 3 hours under favorable conditions.\n\nLet me think about real-world implications. Such rapid growth could lead to significant numbers quickly, which is why bacterial infections can become serious so fast. However, in a controlled lab environment with ample resources, this growth could be sustained for a number of divisions.\n\nIs there a possibility of error in the calculation? Let's check the exponentiation again.\n\n\\( 2^{12} \\):\n\n\\[ 2^1 = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^5 = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^6 = 64 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^8 = 256 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^9 = 512 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{10} = 1024 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{11} = 2048 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{12} = 4096 \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 100 times 4096 is indeed 409,600.\n\nAlternatively, using logarithms to check:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(N(36)) = \\log_{10}(100 \\times 4096) = \\log_{10}(100) + \\log_{10}(4096) \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(100) = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(4096) \\approx 3.612 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{So, } \\log_{10}(N(36)) \\approx 2 + 3.612 = 5.612 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Therefore, } N(36) \\approx 10^{5.612} \\approx 409,600 \\]\n\nThis confirms the calculation.\n\nAnother angle: if the bacteria double every 3 hours, the growth rate per hour can also be calculated.\n\nThe growth rate \\( r \\) per hour can be found from the doubling time:\n\n\\[ 2 = (1 + r)^3 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ 1 + r = 2^{1/3} \\]\n\n\\[ r = 2^{1/3} - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ r \\approx 0.2599 \\text{ or } 25.99\\% \\text{ per hour} \\]\n\nThen, the population after 36 hours would be:\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times (1 + r)^{36} \\]\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times (1.2599)^{36} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1.2599)^{36} \\):\n\nThis is equivalent to \\( 2^{(36/3)} = 2^{12} = 4096 \\), as before.\n\nSo, again, \\( N(36) = 100 \\times 4096 = 409,600 \\).\n\nI think I've confirmed this in every way possible. The answer should be 409,600 bacteria after 36 hours.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's consider the formula for exponential growth again:\n\n\\[ N(t) = N_0 \\times e^{(k \\times t)} \\]\n\nWe found that \\( k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3} \\), so:\n\n\\[ N(36) = 100 \\times e^{(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{3} \\times 36)} = 100 \\times e^{(12 \\times \\ln(2))} = 100 \\times e^{\\ln(4096)} = 100 \\times 4096 = 409,600 \\]\n\nEverything points to 409,600.\n\nI should also consider significant figures. The initial population is given as 100, which has two significant figures, and the time is 36 hours, which has two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be reported with two significant figures: 4.1 x 10^5 bacteria.\n\nHowever, since the problem seems straightforward and no restrictions on significant figures are mentioned, 409,600 is acceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, after 36 hours, starting with 100 bacteria that double every 3 hours, there will be 409,600 bacteria.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{409600} \\]"
