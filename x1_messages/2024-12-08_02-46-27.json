        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 4 meters and a height of 6 meters, and I need to find out how many liters of water it can hold when it's full. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for the volume of a cylinder. I think it's volume equals pi times the radius squared times the height. Yes, that sounds right. So, V = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h.\n\nNow, the diameter is given as 4 meters, so the radius would be half of that, which is 2 meters. And the height is 6 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, I get V = \u03c0 * (2)^2 * 6.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 2 squared is 4. Then, 4 times 6 is 24. So, volume is 24\u03c0 cubic meters. But \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 24 times 3.1416 is about 75.3984 cubic meters.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the volume in liters, not in cubic meters. I need to convert cubic meters to liters. I recall that 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters. So, if the volume is 75.3984 cubic meters, then in liters, it would be 75.3984 times 1000, which is 75,398.4 liters.\n\nBut let's double-check that conversion. Is 1 cubic meter really equal to 1000 liters? Yes, that's standard. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's see. The volume of a cylinder is also sometimes calculated using the formula V = \u03c0 * d\u00b2 * h / 4, where d is the diameter. Let's try that.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * (4)^2 * 6 / 4. That's \u03c0 * 16 * 6 / 4. 16 times 6 is 96, divided by 4 is 24, so again, 24\u03c0 cubic meters, which is the same as before.\n\nOkay, so that confirms the volume is 24\u03c0 cubic meters, or approximately 75.3984 cubic meters, which is 75,398.4 liters.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the exact value instead of an approximation. If I keep it as 24\u03c0 cubic meters, and since 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters, then the exact volume in liters would be 24\u03c0 * 1000, which is 24,000\u03c0 liters.\n\nBut \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 24,000 times that is approximately 75,398.208 liters. Rounding to the nearest liter, it would be 75,398 liters.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, it's common to round to a reasonable number of significant figures. The given dimensions are in whole numbers, so maybe rounding to the nearest thousand liters would be appropriate. That would make it 75,000 liters.\n\nBut let's see what the problem expects. It doesn't specify the level of precision, so perhaps I should provide the exact value using \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, since the question is about a real-world object, a water tank, it might be more practical to use the decimal approximation.\n\nMaybe I should present both answers. So, the exact volume is 24,000\u03c0 liters, which is approximately 75,398 liters.\n\nWait, but in the earlier calculation, I got 75,398.4 liters, and now it's 75,398.208 liters. There's a slight discrepancy due to the value of \u03c0 used.\n\nTo be more precise, let's use \u03c0 as 3.141592653589793. So, 24,000 times that is 75,398.22360535503 liters. Rounding to the nearest liter, it's 75,398 liters.\n\nBut in reality, water tanks might have some thickness in their walls, and the interior dimensions might be different, but assuming the given dimensions are interior, and considering the problem's context, this should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula or a different approach I should consider.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe using the formula for the volume of a cylinder in terms of radius and height.\n\nV = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h\n\nGiven diameter is 4 meters, so radius r = 2 meters.\n\nHeight h = 6 meters.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * (2)^2 * 6 = \u03c0 * 4 * 6 = 24\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\nNow, 1 cubic meter = 1000 liters, so V = 24\u03c0 * 1000 = 24,000\u03c0 liters.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159, V \u2248 24,000 * 3.14159 = 75,398.16 liters.\n\nRounding to the nearest liter, it's 75,398 liters.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider more decimal places for \u03c0, say \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, then V \u2248 24,000 * 3.1415926535 = 75,398.22368 liters, which still rounds to 75,398 liters.\n\nSo, I think 75,398 liters is the accurate answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the possible error in measurement. If the diameter and height are measured to the nearest meter, then there could be an error of up to 0.5 meters in each dimension.\n\nHowever, since the problem gives explicit dimensions without mentioning any errors, I'll assume the given dimensions are exact.\n\nAlternatively, if the tank has walls of non-negligible thickness, the interior volume would be less, but again, assuming the given dimensions are interior, this shouldn't be a issue.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the shape of the tank. If it's not a perfect cylinder, but somehow bulges or tapers, the volume would be different, but the problem states it's cylindrical.\n\nAlso, in real life, water tanks might have some space left at the top to prevent overflow, but the problem asks for the volume when full, so I should consider the entire interior volume.\n\nAdditionally, water has a coefficient of expansion with temperature, but since no temperature is specified, and the problem seems to be at standard conditions, I'll ignore that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the tank can hold approximately 75,398 liters of water when full.\n\nBut to present it more neatly, perhaps I can round it to 75,400 liters, considering the precision of the given dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I can keep it as 75,398 liters.\n\nHmm, maybe I should check if there's a standard way to report volumes in such contexts.\n\nIn any case, I think 75,400 liters is a reasonable answer.\n\nWait, but if I round 75,398.4 to the nearest liter, it's 75,398 liters. Rounding to the nearest hundred would be 75,400 liters.\n\nPerhaps it's better to report the volume as 75,400 liters, acknowledging that it's an approximation.\n\nSo, the cylindrical water tank can hold approximately 75,400 liters of water when full.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75400} \\]"
