        "content": "Yes, the release of Space Invaders in 1978 is often credited with causing a shortage of \u00a5100 coins in Japan. The game was incredibly popular and people were lining up to play it, inserting \u00a5100 coins into the machines. This led to a significant decrease in the number of \u00a5100 coins in circulation, as they were being hoarded in the game machines. The Japanese government had to increase the production of \u00a5100 coins to meet the demand."
