        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that a factory produces 500 widgets in 8 hours. The factory decides to operate 16 hours a day, and we need to find out how many widgets it produces in a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the production rate of the factory. If it produces 500 widgets in 8 hours, I can calculate how many widgets it produces per hour. That should give me a baseline production rate.\n\nSo, widgets per hour = 500 widgets / 8 hours = 62.5 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, if the factory operates 16 hours a day, I can calculate the daily production by multiplying the hourly production rate by the number of hours it operates each day.\n\nDaily production = 62.5 widgets/hour * 16 hours/day = 1000 widgets/day.\n\nFinally, to find out the weekly production, I'll multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week.\n\nWeekly production = 1000 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 7000 widgets/week.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: 500 widgets in 8 hours means 500/8 = 62.5 widgets per hour. That's correct.\n\nIf it operates 16 hours a day, then 62.5 * 16 = 1000 widgets per day. That also seems right.\n\nOver 7 days, 1000 * 7 = 7000 widgets. Yeah, that appears to be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of ratios. If the factory operates twice as many hours in a day (from 8 to 16 hours), it should produce twice as many widgets per day, assuming the production rate stays the same.\n\nSo, if it produces 500 widgets in 8 hours, in 16 hours it should produce 500 * 2 = 1000 widgets per day.\n\nThen, over 7 days, 1000 * 7 = 7000 widgets.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm more confident now.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total operating hours in a week and then multiply by the production rate.\n\nFirst, find the total operating hours in a week:\n\n16 hours/day * 7 days/week = 112 hours/week.\n\nThen, multiply by the production rate:\n\n112 hours/week * 62.5 widgets/hour = 7000 widgets/week.\n\nAgain, the same result. This reinforces that 7000 widgets is the correct weekly production.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The factory produces 7000 widgets in a week when operating 16 hours a day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7000} \\]"
