        "content": "So, the train is going at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour, and it needs to cover a distance of 240 kilometers. I need to find out how long it takes to do that. Okay, I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, I should divide the distance by the speed to get the time.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 240 km / 80 km/h\n\nNow, when I divide 240 by 80, I get 3. And the units would be hours because kilometers cancel out, leaving hours.\n\nSo, the train takes 3 hours to complete the journey.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should check this with another way. Maybe using the formula Speed = Distance / Time, and rearranging it to find time.\n\nSo, Speed = Distance / Time\n\nThen, Time = Distance / Speed\n\nAgain, the same formula. So, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of how much distance the train covers in one hour and see how many hours it takes to cover 240 km.\n\nSince the train travels 80 km every hour, to cover 240 km, it would take 240 divided by 80, which is again 3 hours.\n\nAlright, all these methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that it's correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the time, like stops or speed variations. But the problem says the average speed is 80 km/h, so I think it's safe to assume that's the overall speed including any stops or changes in speed.\n\nSo, no need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The distance is in kilometers and the speed is in kilometers per hour, so dividing them gives hours, which is fine.\n\nIf the units were different, I might need to convert them, but in this case, they match.\n\nAlright, I think that's all I need to do for this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
