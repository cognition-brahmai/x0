Zoonotic.\n\nTo provide some more information, zoonotic diseases are significant in public health because they pose a risk not only to animals but also to humans who come into contact with them. Examples of zoonotic diseases include rabies, Lyme disease, and certain types of influenza. It's important for both veterinarians and healthcare providers to be aware of these diseases to prevent their spread between animals and humans."
