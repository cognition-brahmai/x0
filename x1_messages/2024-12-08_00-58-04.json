The expression is (3^2 * 4) / (2 * 6) - 1.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the exponentiation, multiplication, and division before subtraction, following the order of operations, often remembered by PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the exponentiation:\n\n3^2 = 9\n\nNow, the expression becomes (9 * 4) / (2 * 6) - 1\n\nNext, perform the multiplications inside the parentheses:\n\n9 * 4 = 36\n\n2 * 6 = 12\n\nSo now it's 36 / 12 - 1\n\nThen, division:\n\n36 / 12 = 3\n\nFinally, subtraction:\n\n3 - 1 = 2\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2."
