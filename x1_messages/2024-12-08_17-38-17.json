        "content": "So, the problem is that a baker uses 2 eggs to make 3 cupcakes, and I need to find out how many eggs he'll need to make 24 cupcakes. Hmm, this seems like a ratio problem, right? So, I need to figure out the relationship between the number of eggs and the number of cupcakes.\n\nFirst, I know that 2 eggs make 3 cupcakes. So, the ratio of eggs to cupcakes is 2:3. Now, I need to scale this up to find out how many eggs are needed for 24 cupcakes. I think I can set up a proportion for this.\n\nLet me denote the number of eggs needed for 24 cupcakes as x. So, the proportion would be:\n\n2 eggs / 3 cupcakes = x eggs / 24 cupcakes\n\nNow, to solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n2 * 24 = 3 * x\n\nThat gives:\n\n48 = 3x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 48 / 3\n\nx = 16\n\nSo, the baker will need 16 eggs to make 24 cupcakes.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Another way to think about it is to find out how many eggs are needed per cupcake. If 2 eggs make 3 cupcakes, then the number of eggs per cupcake is 2/3.\n\nSo, for 24 cupcakes, it would be 24 * (2/3) = 48/3 = 16 eggs.\n\nThat matches my previous answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of multiples. If 3 cupcakes require 2 eggs, then to find out how many sets of 3 cupcakes are there in 24, I can divide 24 by 3, which is 8. So, there are 8 sets of 3 cupcakes in 24.\n\nSince each set requires 2 eggs, then 8 sets would require 8 * 2 = 16 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider another approach to be thorough. What if I consider the ratio of cupcakes to eggs instead? That would be 3 cupcakes per 2 eggs, or 3/2.\n\nSo, if I have x cupcakes per egg, it's 3/2 cupcakes per egg.\n\nBut I think sticking with the original approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, I could use dimensional analysis. If I have 2 eggs per 3 cupcakes, then the conversion factor is 2 eggs / 3 cupcakes.\n\nSo, to find out how many eggs are needed for 24 cupcakes, I can multiply the number of cupcakes by the conversion factor:\n\n24 cupcakes * (2 eggs / 3 cupcakes) = 48/3 eggs = 16 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think no matter which way I approach this, the answer comes out to be 16 eggs.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of a different answer.\n\nSuppose the baker has some constraints or there's some efficiency in using eggs that changes with scale, but based on the problem, it seems like a straightforward proportion.\n\nThere's no information suggesting that the ratio changes with the number of cupcakes, so I can assume the ratio remains constant.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the baker needs 16 eggs to make 24 cupcakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
