        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a farmer who has sheep and chickens. He counts a total of 35 heads and 94 legs. We need to figure out how many sheep and how many chickens there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. Each sheep has 1 head and 4 legs, and each chicken has 1 head and 2 legs. The total number of heads is 35, which means the total number of animals is 35 because each animal has one head. The total number of legs is 94.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to set up a system of equations. Let's define:\n\n- Let S be the number of sheep.\n\n- Let C be the number of chickens.\n\nFrom the information given, we can write two equations:\n\n1. S + C = 35 (since total heads are 35)\n\n2. 4S + 2C = 94 (since sheep have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs, and total legs are 94)\n\nNow, I need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of S and C.\n\nOne way to solve this is by substitution. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for C:\n\nC = 35 - S\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n4S + 2(35 - S) = 94\n\nNow, simplify and solve for S:\n\n4S + 70 - 2S = 94\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2S + 70 = 94\n\nSubtract 70 from both sides:\n\n2S = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nS = 12\n\nNow that we have S, we can find C:\n\nC = 35 - S = 35 - 12 = 23\n\nSo, there are 12 sheep and 23 chickens.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal heads: 12 + 23 = 35 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal legs: (12 * 4) + (23 * 2) = 48 + 46 = 94 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks good.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using elimination method for the system of equations.\n\nStarting with:\n\n1. S + C = 35\n\n2. 4S + 2C = 94\n\nI can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of C the same:\n\n2S + 2C = 70\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n(4S + 2C) - (2S + 2C) = 94 - 70\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2S = 24\n\nSo, S = 12\n\nThen, C = 35 - 12 = 23\n\nSame answer as before. That's reassuring.\n\nIs there a way to solve this without using algebra? Maybe using logic or trial and error?\n\nSure, let's try that.\n\nWe know there are 35 animals in total. If all of them were chickens, then there would be 35 * 2 = 70 legs. But there are 94 legs, which is 24 legs more than if all were chickens.\n\nSince each sheep has 2 more legs than a chicken, the number of sheep must be 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nThen, the number of chickens is 35 - 12 = 23.\n\nAgain, we get the same answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to assume all animals are sheep. Then, there would be 35 * 4 = 140 legs. But there are only 94 legs, which is 46 legs less than if all were sheep.\n\nSince each chicken has 2 legs less than a sheep, the number of chickens must be 46 / 2 = 23.\n\nThen, the number of sheep is 35 - 23 = 12.\n\nOnce again, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 12 sheep and 23 chickens.\n\nLet me consider if there could be other solutions. For example, maybe there are negative numbers of animals or fractional animals, but that doesn't make sense in reality. So, I'll stick with the integer solution.\n\nIs there a possibility that the problem has multiple solutions? Given that we have two equations and two variables, and the equations are linearly independent, there should be a unique solution.\n\nLet me verify the equations again.\n\nEquation 1: S + C = 35\n\nEquation 2: 4S + 2C = 94\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is:\n\n|1 1|\n\n|4 2|\n\nDeterminant = (1*2) - (1*4) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nSince the determinant is not zero, the system has a unique solution.\n\nTherefore, 12 sheep and 23 chickens is the only solution.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can consider that some sheep are missing legs or something, but that's getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other types of animals, but the problem says only about sheep and chickens.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that there are 12 sheep and 23 chickens.\n\nLet me try to present this in a clear manner.\n\nSolution:\n\nLet S be the number of sheep and C be the number of chickens.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. S + C = 35 (total heads)\n\n2. 4S + 2C = 94 (total legs)\n\nUsing the substitution method:\n\nFrom equation 1: C = 35 - S\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n4S + 2(35 - S) = 94\n\n4S + 70 - 2S = 94\n\n2S + 70 = 94\n\n2S = 24\n\nS = 12\n\nThen, C = 35 - 12 = 23\n\nTherefore, there are 12 sheep and 23 chickens.\n\nCheck:\n\nTotal heads: 12 + 23 = 35 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal legs: (12 * 4) + (23 * 2) = 48 + 46 = 94 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAlternative method (elimination):\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2S + 2C = 70\n\nSubtract from equation 2: (4S + 2C) - (2S + 2C) = 94 - 70\n\n2S = 24 \u2192 S = 12\n\nThen, C = 35 - 12 = 23\n\nLogical approach:\n\nIf all were chickens: 35 * 2 = 70 legs\n\nActual legs: 94\n\nDifference: 94 - 70 = 24 legs\n\nEach sheep adds 2 legs compared to a chicken\n\nNumber of sheep: 24 / 2 = 12\n\nNumber of chickens: 35 - 12 = 23\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe farmer has 12 sheep and 23 chickens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12 \\text{ sheep and } 23 \\text{ chickens}} \\]"
