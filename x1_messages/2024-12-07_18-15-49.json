You see, in the village where I grew up, everyone had their own idea of what beauty was. Some thought it was all about looks\u2014big, bright eyes, or flowing hair, or a charming smile. But I always felt there was more to it than that.\n\nYou see, when I first met the Beast, he wasn't what anyone would call handsome. Oh, no, not by a long shot. But as I got to know him, I saw beyond his\u7c97\u66b4\u7684\u5916\u8868. I saw his kindness, his intelligence, and his gentle heart. That's when I realized that true beauty isn't just about how you look on the outside; it's about who you are on the inside.\n\nTake Maurice, for example. He's not the most dashing figure, but he's so full of life and curiosity. His mind is like a treasure trove of inventions and ideas. That's beauty to me\u2014beauty that comes from within.\n\nAnd then there's Gaston. Now, he's what most people would consider handsome\u2014strong, athletic, and confident. But beneath that charming exterior, he's shallow and selfish. To me, that kind of beauty is superficial. It doesn't satisfy my soul.\n\nSo, in the end, I suppose true beauty is about finding that balance between outward appearance and inner qualities. It's about appreciating both the exterior and the interior, and understanding that sometimes, the most beautiful things are those that aren't immediately obvious.\n\nAs the song says, \"Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all ye know and all ye need to know.\" It's a timeless concept, isn't it? Beauty isn't just skin deep; it's about the whole package.\n\nSo, my dear, when you're searching for true beauty, look beyond the surface. Look into a person's heart and see what makes them truly beautiful. Because, in the end, that's what really matters.\n\n**[End of Transmission]**"
