        "content": "So the hotel is planning to open a new location with 150 rooms, and they want to allocate them into three types: singles, doubles, and suites. The percentages given are 40% for singles, 50% for doubles, and 10% for suites. Also, they have average nightly rates for each type: $120 for singles, $180 for doubles, and $350 for suites. We need to calculate how many of each type of room there will be and then figure out the total revenue if all rooms are occupied.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many of each type of room there will be.\n\nTotal rooms = 150\n\nPercentage of singles = 40%\n\nNumber of single rooms = 40% of 150 = (40/100) * 150 = 60 rooms\n\nPercentage of doubles = 50%\n\nNumber of double rooms = 50% of 150 = (50/100) * 150 = 75 rooms\n\nPercentage of suites = 10%\n\nNumber of suite rooms = 10% of 150 = (10/100) * 150 = 15 rooms\n\nSo, there will be 60 single rooms, 75 double rooms, and 15 suite rooms.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total revenue assuming full occupancy. That means all rooms are occupied, and we'll use the average nightly rates for each type.\n\nRevenue from single rooms = number of single rooms * rate per single room = 60 * 120 = $7,200\n\nRevenue from double rooms = number of double rooms * rate per double room = 75 * 180 = $13,500\n\nRevenue from suite rooms = number of suite rooms * rate per suite room = 15 * 350 = $5,250\n\nTotal revenue = revenue from singles + revenue from doubles + revenue from suites = 7,200 + 13,500 + 5,250 = $25,950\n\nTherefore, with full occupancy, the hotel can generate $25,950 in nightly revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25950} \\]"
