        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a company with 200 employees: 120 are full-time and 80 are part-time. They want to hire 50 more employees while keeping the same ratio of full-time to part-time workers. We need to figure out how many of these new hires should be full-time and how many should be part-time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the current ratio of full-time to part-time workers is. There are 120 full-time employees and 80 part-time employees. To find the ratio, I can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 120 and 80 is 40.\n\nSo, 120 divided by 40 is 3, and 80 divided by 40 is 2. That means the current ratio of full-time to part-time workers is 3:2.\n\nNow, the company wants to maintain this 3:2 ratio when hiring 50 new employees. Let's denote the number of full-time hires as F and the number of part-time hires as P. We know that F + P = 50, because they're hiring 50 employees in total.\n\nWe also know that the ratio of F to P should be 3:2. So, F/P = 3/2.\n\nFrom this proportion, I can express F in terms of P: F = (3/2)P.\n\nNow, substituting F in the first equation:\n\n(3/2)P + P = 50.\n\nTo solve for P, I can combine the terms:\n\n(3/2)P + (2/2)P = (5/2)P = 50.\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 2/5 to solve for P:\n\nP = (2/5)*50 = 20.\n\nSo, the number of part-time hires should be 20.\n\nNow, to find the number of full-time hires, F:\n\nF = 50 - P = 50 - 20 = 30.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio F = (3/2)P = (3/2)*20 = 30.\n\nEither way, they should hire 30 full-time employees and 20 part-time employees.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure this makes sense. The current workforce has 120 full-time and 80 part-time employees. After hiring, it will have 120 + 30 = 150 full-time employees and 80 + 20 = 100 part-time employees.\n\nNow, let's check the new ratio: 150:100, which simplifies to 3:2, the same as before. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the proportion of full-time and part-time employees in the current workforce.\n\nCurrently, out of 200 employees, 120 are full-time. So, the proportion of full-time employees is 120/200 = 0.6, or 60%.\n\nPart-time employees are 80/200 = 0.4, or 40%.\n\nSo, the ratio is 60% full-time to 40% part-time.\n\nIf we apply this same proportion to the new hires:\n\n50 hires * 60% = 30 full-time hires\n\n50 hires * 40% = 20 part-time hires.\n\nThis matches what I found earlier using the ratio method.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. The ratio of full-time to part-time is 3:2. That means for every 3 full-time employees, there are 2 part-time employees.\n\nThe total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nCurrently, there are 200 employees, so each part represents 200 / 5 = 40 employees.\n\nTherefore, full-time employees are 3 parts * 40 = 120, and part-time are 2 parts * 40 = 80, which matches the given numbers.\n\nNow, with the new hires, the total number of employees will be 200 + 50 = 250.\n\nUsing the same ratio, each part would represent 250 / 5 = 50 employees.\n\nTherefore, full-time employees should be 3 parts * 50 = 150.\n\nPart-time employees should be 2 parts * 50 = 100.\n\nSo, the number of new full-time hires is 150 - 120 = 30.\n\nThe number of new part-time hires is 100 - 80 = 20.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think it's clear that the company should hire 30 full-time employees and 20 part-time employees to maintain the same ratio.\n\nJust to explore another angle, suppose they hire x full-time employees and y part-time employees, where x + y = 50.\n\nWe want the ratio of full-time to part-time to remain 3:2.\n\nSo, (120 + x)/(80 + y) = 3/2.\n\nWe already know that x + y = 50.\n\nLet's solve these equations simultaneously.\n\nFrom the ratio:\n\n(120 + x)/(80 + y) = 3/2\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n2*(120 + x) = 3*(80 + y)\n\n240 + 2x = 240 + 3y\n\nSubtract 240 from both sides:\n\n2x = 3y\n\nSo, 2x - 3y = 0.\n\nWe also have x + y = 50.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n2x - 3y = 0\n\nx + y = 50\n\nLet's solve for x and y.\n\nFrom the second equation, x = 50 - y.\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n2*(50 - y) - 3y = 0\n\n100 - 2y - 3y = 0\n\n100 - 5y = 0\n\n5y = 100\n\ny = 20.\n\nThen, x = 50 - 20 = 30.\n\nAgain, we get x = 30 and y = 20.\n\nThis reinforces the previous results.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the proportion of full-time employees in the new hires should be the same as in the current workforce.\n\nCurrent proportion of full-time employees is 120/200 = 0.6.\n\nSo, in the new hires, 0.6 * 50 = 30 should be full-time.\n\nSimilarly, part-time proportion is 80/200 = 0.4.\n\nSo, 0.4 * 50 = 20 should be part-time.\n\nThis is consistent with all the previous methods.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the company should hire 30 full-time employees and 20 part-time employees to maintain the same ratio.\n\nJust to make sure there's no other way to interpret this, let's consider if the ratio needs to be maintained in terms of the total workforce after hires.\n\nCurrently, the ratio is 120:80, which is 3:2.\n\nAfter hiring, it should still be 3:2.\n\nWe've approached this by keeping the ratio of new hires at 3:2, and also by ensuring that the overall ratio remains 3:2.\n\nBoth approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the required number of full-time and part-time employees after the hires and then find the difference from the current numbers.\n\nLet me do that.\n\nTotal employees after hires: 200 + 50 = 250.\n\nTo maintain a 3:2 ratio, the number of full-time employees should be (3/5)*250 = 150.\n\nSimilarly, part-time employees should be (2/5)*250 = 100.\n\nTherefore, the number of new full-time hires needed is 150 - 120 = 30.\n\nThe number of new part-time hires needed is 100 - 80 = 20.\n\nThis yet again confirms the earlier calculations.\n\nI feel confident that 30 full-time and 20 part-time hires are required to maintain the same ratio.\n\nJust to summarize, we've used multiple methods to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n1. Using the ratio directly to set up a proportion and solve for the number of hires.\n\n2. Calculating the proportion of full-time and part-time employees in the current workforce and applying those proportions to the new hires.\n\n3. Considering the total parts of the ratio and determining the value per part after the hires.\n\n4. Setting up and solving a system of equations based on the ratio and the total number of hires.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer, which reinforces its correctness.\n\nI don't think there's any other approach I can think of that would change this result.\n\nTherefore, the company should hire 30 full-time employees and 20 part-time employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30 \\text{ full-time and } 20 \\text{ part-time workers}} \\]"
