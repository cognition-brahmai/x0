        "content": "Alright, I need to find out the average lifespan of an African elephant in the wild. Let's think about how to approach this. First, I should probably look for reliable sources that have information on elephant lifespans. Wikipedia might be a good starting point since it's widely available and often has a lot of information, but I also need to verify the facts from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\nSo, my first step would be to search for \"African elephant lifespan\" on Google to see what comes up. Maybe there are scientific studies or wildlife organization pages that provide this information. Once I have some sources, I can check the WikiData for any structured data related to elephant lifespans. Additionally, if I find long articles or reports, I can use the TextSummarizer to condense the information into something more manageable.\n\nAfter gathering the data, I should use the FactChecker to verify the information across different sources to make sure I'm getting an accurate average. Sometimes, different sources might have slightly different numbers based on various studies or conditions, so it's important to look for consensus among them.\n\nFinally, once I have verified the information, I can provide the average lifespan figure to the user. If there's any additional interesting information, like how lifespan might vary based on factors such as habitat or conservation status, I can include that as well, but the main goal is to give the average lifespan in the wild.\n\nSo, to summarize my plan:\n\n1. Use GoogleSearch to find information on African elephant lifespans in the wild.\n\n2. Check WikiData for any structured data on elephant lifespans.\n\n3. If necessary, use TextSummarizer on any long texts to extract key information.\n\n4. Use FactChecker to verify the lifespan information across multiple sources.\n\n5. Provide the final answer based on the verified information.\n\nLet's proceed with the first step.\n\nPlan: Search for \"African elephant lifespan in the wild\" using GoogleSearch.\n\n#E1 = GoogleSearch[\"African elephant lifespan in the wild\"]\n\nNext, I'll look at the results from #E1 and identify reliable sources that provide the lifespan information. I should look for sources like scientific journals, wildlife conservation organizations, or established educational websites.\n\nOnce I have a list of sources, I can check if WikiData has any relevant information.\n\nPlan: Check WikiData for African elephant lifespan.\n\n#E2 = WikiData[\"African elephant lifespan\"]\n\nIf WikiData provides some data, I should note it down and compare it with the information from #E1.\n\nNow, if there are long articles or reports in #E1, I can use the TextSummarizer to get the key points.\n\nPlan: If any long texts are found in #E1, use TextSummarizer to summarize them.\n\n#E3 = TextSummarizer[input: specific long text from #E1]\n\nAfter summarizing, I can extract the lifespan figures from #E1 and #E2.\n\nThen, I need to verify these figures using FactChecker to ensure they are accurate and consistent across multiple sources.\n\nPlan: Use FactChecker to verify the lifespan figures from #E1 and #E2.\n\n#E4 = FactChecker[input: lifespan figures from #E1 and #E2]\n\nFactChecker should cross-reference the information and provide a confidence level on the accuracy of the figures.\n\nOnce I have the verified information from #E4, I can determine the average lifespan of an African elephant in the wild.\n\nIf there are any discrepancies or variations in the lifespan figures from different sources, I should note that and consider providing a range if appropriate.\n\nFinally, I can present the average lifespan to the user, possibly including some context on how this compares to captive elephants or other elephant species, but the main focus is on African elephants in the wild.\n\nSo, summarizing the final answer:\n\nFinal Answer: Based on verified sources, the average lifespan of an African elephant in the wild is [insert figure] years.\n\nI'll proceed to execute this plan step by step.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo determine the average lifespan of an African elephant in the wild, a systematic approach involving multiple tools and verification steps is necessary. Here\u2019s a step-by-step plan to arrive at an accurate answer:\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Search for Information:**\n   - Use `GoogleSearch` to find information on African elephant lifespans in the wild.\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   #E1 = GoogleSearch[\"African elephant lifespan in the wild\"]\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Structured Data:**\n   - Use `WikiData` to retrieve any structured data on African elephant lifespans.\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   #E2 = WikiData[\"African elephant lifespan\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Summarize Long Texts:**\n   - If long articles or reports are found in #E1, use `TextSummarizer` to extract key information.\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   #E3 = TextSummarizer[input: specific long text from #E1]\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Facts:**\n   - Use `FactChecker` to verify the lifespan figures obtained from #E1 and #E2 across multiple sources.\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   #E4 = FactChecker[input: lifespan figures from #E1 and #E2]\n   ```\n\n5. **Provide Final Answer:**\n   - Based on the verified information, provide the average lifespan of an African elephant in the wild.\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   Final Answer: [insert figure based on #E4]\n   ```\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **Google Search Results (#E1):**\n   - Searches for \"African elephant lifespan in the wild\" and retrieves a list of websites, including wildlife organizations, educational institutions, and scientific articles.\n\n2. **WikiData Information (#E2):**\n   - Queries WikiData for African elephant lifespan and retrieves structured data, if available.\n\n3. **Text Summarization (#E3):**\n   - Identifies any lengthy articles from #E1 and summarizes them to extract key points regarding lifespan.\n\n4. **Fact Verification (#E4):**\n   - Cross-references the lifespan figures from #E1 and #E2 using `FactChecker` to ensure accuracy and consistency across multiple sources.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - Compiles the verified information to state the average lifespan of an African elephant in the wild.\n\nBy following this plan, we ensure that the information is accurate, reliable, and well-verified through multiple sources. This approach not only provides the required answer but also builds confidence in its accuracy through systematic verification."
