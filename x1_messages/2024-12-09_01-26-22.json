        "content": "So I've got this problem here about determining the optimal room pricing strategy for a new hotel property. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the hotel has 300 rooms, and they expect an average occupancy rate of 75%. So, on average, how many rooms are occupied per night? That would be 300 rooms times 75%, which is 225 rooms.\n\nNext, each room costs $100 per night to maintain, including cleaning, utilities, and staff wages. So, the total daily maintenance cost is 300 rooms times $100, which equals $30,000 per day.\n\nWait a minute, but only 225 rooms are occupied on average. Should the maintenance cost be based on occupied rooms or total rooms? Hmm. Well, maintaining all 300 rooms is necessary regardless of occupancy because even unoccupied rooms need cleaning and maintenance. So, the total daily maintenance cost is indeed $30,000.\n\nNow, the company wants to achieve a profit margin of 30% on each room. Profit margin is calculated as (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue = profit margin. So, if we let P be the profit per room, R be the room rate, and C be the cost per room, then P = R - C, and profit margin is P/R = 0.30.\n\nBut wait, the cost per room is $100, but that's the maintenance cost per room per night. So, for 225 occupied rooms, the total maintenance cost is 225 rooms * $100 = $22,500. But earlier, I thought it was $30,000 for all 300 rooms. Which one is it?\n\nI think there's a confusion here. The maintenance cost is $100 per room per night, regardless of whether it's occupied or not. So, for all 300 rooms, the daily maintenance cost is $30,000.\n\nBut when calculating profit per room, maybe they're considering only the occupied rooms. Let's try to clarify this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Total rooms: 300\n\n- Occupancy rate: 75% \u2192 occupied rooms = 225\n\n- Maintenance cost per room per night: $100\n\n- Total maintenance cost per night: 300 rooms * $100 = $30,000\n\n- Desired profit margin: 30% on each room\n\nWait, is the profit margin per room or on the total revenue? The problem says \"achieve a profit margin of 30% on each room.\" So, probably per room.\n\nSo, for each occupied room, they want a profit margin of 30%. Meaning, (R - C)/R = 0.30, where R is the room rate and C is the cost per room.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for R:\n\n(R - C)/R = 0.30\n\n1 - C/R = 0.30\n\nC/R = 0.70\n\nR = C / 0.70\n\nGiven that C = $100, then R = $100 / 0.70 = approximately $142.86\n\nSo, the room rate should be at least $142.86 to achieve a 30% profit margin per room.\n\nBut wait, this doesn't take into account the fixed costs for all 300 rooms. Because even if only 225 rooms are occupied, the maintenance cost for all 300 rooms is $30,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost per occupied room is not just $100, but a portion of the total maintenance cost.\n\nLet\u2019s try another approach.\n\nTotal maintenance cost: $30,000 per day\n\nAverage occupancy: 225 rooms\n\nSo, cost per occupied room: $30,000 / 225 = $133.33 per room per night\n\nNow, if they want a 30% profit margin on each room, using the same formula:\n\n(R - C)/R = 0.30\n\nR - C = 0.30R\n\nR - 0.30R = C\n\n0.70R = C\n\nR = C / 0.70 = $133.33 / 0.70 \u2248 $190.48\n\nSo, in this case, the room rate should be approximately $190.48\n\nBut this seems higher than the previous calculation. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion lies in how the maintenance cost is allocated. In the first approach, I considered the maintenance cost per room as $100, regardless of occupancy. In the second approach, I calculated the cost per occupied room by dividing the total maintenance cost by the number of occupied rooms, which is $133.33.\n\nBut actually, the maintenance cost is $100 per room per night, regardless of occupancy. So, for 300 rooms, it's $30,000 per day.\n\nHowever, the cost per occupied room is not necessarily $100, because the fixed costs are spread over the occupied rooms.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider both fixed and variable costs.\n\nIn hotel management, costs can be fixed (e.g., staff salaries, utilities) and variable (e.g., room cleaning per occupied room).\n\nBut in this problem, it's stated that the maintenance cost is $100 per room per night, including cleaning, utilities, and staff wages. So, perhaps this $100 is a combination of fixed and variable costs allocated per room.\n\nGiven that, the total daily maintenance cost is $30,000.\n\nNow, to find the room rate that achieves a 30% profit margin, considering the total revenue and total costs.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Room rate: R\n\n- Number of occupied rooms: 225\n\n- Total revenue: 225 * R\n\n- Total costs: $30,000\n\n- Profit: Total revenue - Total costs = 225R - 30,000\n\n- Profit margin: Profit / Total revenue = (225R - 30,000) / (225R) = 0.30\n\nSo, (225R - 30,000) / 225R = 0.30\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 - (30,000 / 225R) = 0.30\n\nSo, 30,000 / 225R = 0.70\n\nThen, 225R = 30,000 / 0.70 = 42,857.14\n\nTherefore, R = 42,857.14 / 225 \u2248 $190.48\n\nSo, this confirms the second approach, and the room rate should be approximately $190.48\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense.\n\nAt $190.48 per room, with 225 rooms occupied, total revenue is 225 * 190.48 = $42,857.14\n\nTotal costs are $30,000\n\nProfit is $42,857.14 - $30,000 = $12,857.14\n\nProfit margin is $12,857.14 / $42,857.14 \u2248 0.30, which is 30%, as desired.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the cost per occupied room as $100, and apply the profit margin formula per room, we get a different rate, but that doesn't account for the total maintenance cost across all rooms.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to consider the total revenue and total costs, and set the profit margin based on that.\n\nHence, the minimum nightly room rate needed to meet these goals is approximately $190.48\n\nBut to make it a round number, maybe they can set the rate at $195 or $200.\n\nBut since the exact calculation gives $190.48, perhaps they can set it at $190 or $195.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimum nightly room rate needed to meet these goals, so $190.48 is the precise figure.\n\nBut in practice, hotels often set rates in round numbers, like $190 or $195, for simplicity and perceived value.\n\nAdditionally, other factors like competition, demand, and pricing psychology should be considered, but based solely on the given information, $190.48 is the calculated minimum room rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{190.48}"
