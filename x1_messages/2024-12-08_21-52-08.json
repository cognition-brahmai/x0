        "content": "To derive the formula for the area of a trapezoid using calculus, we'll consider a trapezoid as a geometric shape with four sides, where two of the sides are parallel. These parallel sides are called the bases, and the non-parallel sides are called the legs. Let's denote the lengths of the two bases as \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and the height (the perpendicular distance between the bases) as \\( h \\).\n\nOur goal is to find the area \\( A \\) of this trapezoid using integral calculus. To do this, we'll set up a coordinate system and integrate the function that represents the shape of the trapezoid.\n\n**Step 1: Setting up the Coordinate System**\n\nLet's place the trapezoid on the coordinate plane for easier calculation. We'll position one base of length \\( a \\) along the x-axis from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = a \\), and the other base of length \\( b \\) parallel to the first base, located at a height \\( h \\) above the x-axis.\n\nIf \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal, the trapezoid is actually a rectangle, but generally, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be different. Without loss of generality, assume \\( a \\leq b \\).\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Functions for the Sides**\n\nSince the trapezoid has two parallel bases, the legs connecting these bases will be slanted if \\( a \\neq b \\). We need to find the equations of these slanted sides to set up the integral.\n\nLet's denote the left leg connecting \\( (0, 0) \\) to some point \\( (c, h) \\), and the right leg connecting \\( (a, 0) \\) to \\( (c + (b - a), h) \\). However, this setup might be a bit confusing, so let's simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the trapezoid can be represented by two linear functions between \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = h \\), but actually, to make it consistent with the standard trapezoid, it's better to think in terms of \\( x \\) ranging from 0 to some value where the trapezoid spans.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the trapezoid as being bounded by four lines: two vertical lines at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = h \\), and two slanted lines connecting the bases.\n\nActually, to make it straightforward, let's consider the trapezoid as being bounded by the x-axis from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = a \\), and by two lines that slope up to the top base of length \\( b \\) at height \\( h \\).\n\nBut this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better way is to consider the trapezoid as being bounded by the lines \\( y = 0 \\), \\( y = h \\), and two slanted sides.\n\nWait, perhaps parametrize in terms of \\( y \\), integrating with respect to \\( y \\) from 0 to \\( h \\).\n\nLet's try that.\n\n**Step 3: Expressing the Width as a Function of Height**\n\nImagine slicing the trapezoid horizontally at different heights \\( y \\), where \\( y \\) ranges from 0 to \\( h \\). At each height \\( y \\), the width of the trapezoid will be different, ranging from \\( a \\) at \\( y = 0 \\) to \\( b \\) at \\( y = h \\).\n\nWe can express the width \\( w(y) \\) as a linear function of \\( y \\), since the sides are straight lines.\n\nLet\u2019s find the equation for \\( w(y) \\).\n\nAt \\( y = 0 \\), \\( w(0) = a \\).\n\nAt \\( y = h \\), \\( w(h) = b \\).\n\nThe general form of a linear function is \\( w(y) = m y + c \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( c \\) is the y-intercept.\n\nFrom \\( w(0) = a \\), we get \\( c = a \\).\n\nFrom \\( w(h) = b \\), we get \\( m h + a = b \\), so \\( m = \\frac{b - a}{h} \\).\n\nTherefore, the width at height \\( y \\) is:\n\n\\[ w(y) = \\frac{b - a}{h} y + a \\]\n\n**Step 4: Setting Up the Integral**\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of the trapezoid can be found by integrating the width function \\( w(y) \\) with respect to \\( y \\) from 0 to \\( h \\):\n\n\\[ A = \\int_{0}^{h} w(y) \\, dy = \\int_{0}^{h} \\left( \\frac{b - a}{h} y + a \\right) dy \\]\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the Integral**\n\nNow, let's compute this integral step by step.\n\nFirst, distribute the integral:\n\n\\[ A = \\int_{0}^{h} \\frac{b - a}{h} y \\, dy + \\int_{0}^{h} a \\, dy \\]\n\nCompute each integral separately.\n\nThe first integral:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{h} \\frac{b - a}{h} y \\, dy = \\frac{b - a}{h} \\int_{0}^{h} y \\, dy = \\frac{b - a}{h} \\left[ \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{h} = \\frac{b - a}{h} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{2} = \\frac{(b - a) h}{2} \\]\n\nThe second integral:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{h} a \\, dy = a \\int_{0}^{h} dy = a [y]_{0}^{h} = a h \\]\n\n**Step 6: Combining the Results**\n\nNow, add the results of the two integrals:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{(b - a) h}{2} + a h = \\frac{b h - a h}{2} + a h = \\frac{b h - a h + 2 a h}{2} = \\frac{b h + a h}{2} = \\frac{(a + b) h}{2} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A = \\frac{(a + b) h}{2}} \\]\n\nThis is the standard formula for the area of a trapezoid, derived using integral calculus.\n"
