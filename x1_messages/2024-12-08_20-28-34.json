        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a box with 12 red balls, 18 blue balls, and 20 green balls. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball, and the total outcomes are the total number of balls in the box.\n\nLet me find the total number of balls. There are 12 red, 18 blue, and 20 green balls. So, total balls = 12 + 18 + 20. Let's add those up: 12 plus 18 is 30, plus 20 is 50. So, there are 50 balls in total.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball. There are 12 red balls and 18 blue balls. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 12 + 18, which is 30.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 30 divided by 50.\n\nI can simplify that fraction. Both 30 and 50 can be divided by 10, so 30 divided by 10 is 3, and 50 divided by 10 is 5. So, the simplified fraction is 3/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal. 3 divided by 5 is 0.6.\n\nProbability is often expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1, where 0 means it'll never happen, and 1 means it's certain to happen. So, 0.6 means there's a 60% chance of picking either a red or a blue ball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the probability of picking a red ball and the probability of picking a blue ball separately, and then add them together.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 12/50.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball is 18/50.\n\nSo, the probability of picking either red or blue is 12/50 plus 18/50, which is 30/50, which again simplifies to 3/5 or 0.6.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach I can take to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nI could also think about the probability of not picking a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue.\n\nThe number of green balls is 20, and the total number of balls is 50, so the probability of picking a green ball is 20/50, which simplifies to 2/5 or 0.4.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green ball (i.e., picking either red or blue) is 1 minus the probability of picking green, which is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nAgain, this matches my previous calculations. So, I'm confident that 0.6 is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's make sure that all the numbers add up correctly.\n\nTotal balls: 12 red + 18 blue + 20 green = 50 balls.\n\nFavorable outcomes: 12 red + 18 blue = 30 balls.\n\nProbability: 30/50 = 3/5 = 0.6.\n\nYes, that seems absolutely correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random from the box is 0.6, or 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.6} \\]"
