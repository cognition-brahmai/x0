        "content": "Let's see. So, the car rental company charges $20 per day to rent a car, and there's an additional insurance fee of $50. If I rent the car for 5 days, I need to calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of renting the car for 5 days. Since it's $20 per day, I can multiply 20 by 5. That should give me the total rental cost without the insurance.\n\nSo, 20 times 5 is 100. So, the rental cost is $100.\n\nNext, I need to add the insurance fee, which is $50. So, I'll add 100 plus 50.\n\n100 plus 50 equals 150.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for renting the car for 5 days, including insurance, should be $150.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there any sales tax or other fees that might apply? The problem doesn't mention any additional charges, so I think $150 is the final amount.\n\nJust to double-check, let me repeat the calculation.\n\nRental cost: $20 per day for 5 days: 20 * 5 = $100.\n\nInsurance fee: $50.\n\nTotal cost: 100 + 50 = $150.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
