        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are three types of apples: red, green, and yellow. The store has twice as many red apples as green apples, and half as many yellow apples as red apples. And altogether, there are 120 apples. I need to find the ratio of red to green to yellow apples.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to each type of apple to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let G represent the number of green apples.\n\n- Then, since there are twice as many red apples as green apples, red apples would be 2G.\n\n- And yellow apples are half as many as red apples, so yellow apples would be (1/2) * 2G, which simplifies to G.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, yellow apples are also equal to G?\n\nYes, because yellow is half of red, and red is twice green, so yellow ends up being equal to green.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Green apples: G\n\n- Red apples: 2G\n\n- Yellow apples: G\n\nNow, the total number of apples is 120. So, if I add up all the apples:\n\nG + 2G + G = 120\n\nThat simplifies to 4G = 120.\n\nSo, G = 120 / 4 = 30.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Green apples: 30\n\n- Red apples: 2 * 30 = 60\n\n- Yellow apples: 30\n\nNow, the ratio of red to green to yellow apples would be 60:30:30.\n\nBut ratios can be simplified by dividing each number by the greatest common divisor, which in this case is 30.\n\nSo, 60/30 : 30/30 : 30/30 = 2:1:1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 2:1:1.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nIf green is 30, red is 60, and yellow is 30, then yes, red is twice green, and yellow is equal to green, which is half of red. And the total is 120.\n\nSo, the ratio 2:1:1 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of parts. Let's say each part is G.\n\nThen, green is 1 part (G), red is 2 parts (2G), and yellow is 1 part (G).\n\nTotal parts: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 parts.\n\nTotal apples: 120.\n\nSo, each part is 120 / 4 = 30.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Green: 1 part * 30 = 30\n\n- Red: 2 parts * 30 = 60\n\n- Yellow: 1 part * 30 = 30\n\nAgain, the ratio is 60:30:30, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2:1:1} \\]"
