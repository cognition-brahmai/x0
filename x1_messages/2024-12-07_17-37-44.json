        "content": "So the farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters long and 200 meters wide. He plans to plant corn on 60% of the field and wheat on the rest. I need to figure out how many square meters will be used for each crop.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the total area of the field. Since it's a rectangle, the area is length times width, right? So, 300 meters times 200 meters should give me the total area.\n\nLet me calculate that: 300 * 200 = 60,000 square meters. So, the total area of the field is 60,000 square meters.\n\nNow, he wants to plant corn on 60% of the field. To find out how much area that is, I need to calculate 60% of 60,000 square meters.\n\nPercentage means per hundred, so 60% is the same as 60/100 or 0.6. So, 0.6 times 60,000 should give me the area for corn.\n\nLet's do the math: 0.6 * 60,000 = 36,000 square meters. So, 36,000 square meters will be used for planting corn.\n\nNow, for wheat, he's using the remaining area. Since the total area is 60,000 square meters and corn is taking up 36,000 square meters, the remaining area for wheat would be 60,000 - 36,000 = 24,000 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, since corn is 60%, wheat must be 40% of the field. I can check this by calculating 40% of 60,000.\n\n40% is 0.4, so 0.4 * 60,000 = 24,000 square meters. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, to summarize, the farmer will use 36,000 square meters for corn and 24,000 square meters for wheat.\n\nI think that makes sense. It's straightforward once you get the total area and then find the percentages for each crop.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36000 \\text{ square meters for corn and } 24000 \\text{ square meters for wheat}} \\]"
