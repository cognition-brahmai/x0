        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 houses on one side of the street and 30 on the other, making a total of 50 houses. Each house has a dog, but some also have a cat. Specifically, every third house on both sides has a cat.\n\nSo, first, I need to find out how many houses have a cat on each side of the street.\n\nStarting with the side that has 20 houses: to find every third house, I can divide 20 by 3.\n\n20 divided by 3 is approximately 6.666, but since we can't have a fraction of a house, it means 6 houses on this side have a cat.\n\nSimilarly, for the side with 30 houses: 30 divided by 3 is exactly 10, so 10 houses on this side have a cat.\n\nNow, to find the total number of houses with cats, I add these two numbers together: 6 + 10 = 16.\n\nTherefore, there are 16 cats in total in the town.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, since every third house on both sides has a cat, perhaps there's an overlap or some houses are counted twice. But no, each side is independent. The houses are on separate sides of the street, so no overlap.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of houses, which is 50, and then find every third house overall. But the problem specifies that every third house on both sides has a cat, which implies that on each side, every third house has a cat.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach: 20 houses, every third house has a cat, which is 6 houses, and 30 houses, every third house has a cat, which is 10 houses, totaling 16 cats.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
