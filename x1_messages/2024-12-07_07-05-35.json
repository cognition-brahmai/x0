        "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. Merge sort is a powerful sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It's efficient and works well on large datasets. I'll walk you through how to implement it in C++.\n\nFirst, let's understand the basic idea behind merge sort:\n\n1. **Divide**: If the array has more than one element, divide it into two halves.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted array.\n\nThis process continues until the array is divided into smaller arrays that can't be divided further (i.e., arrays of size one), and then it starts merging them back up.\n\nNow, let's look at how to implement this in C++.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Define the Merge Function**: This function will merge two halves of the array.\n2. **Define the Merge Sort Function**: This function will recursively divide the array and call the merge function to combine the sorted halves.\n3. **Main Function**: This is where you'll take input, call the merge sort function, and print the sorted array.\n\n### Code\n\nHere's the complete C++ code for merge sort:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to merge two halves\nvoid merge(vector<int>& arr, int left, int mid, int right) {\n    // Find sizes of two subarrays to be merged\n    int n1 = mid - left + 1;\n    int n2 = right - mid;\n\n    // Create temp arrays\n    vector<int> L(n1), R(n2);\n\n    // Copy data to temp arrays\n    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)\n        L[i] = arr[left + i];\n    for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++)\n        R[j] = arr[mid + 1 + j];\n\n    // Merge the temp arrays back into arr[left..right]\n    int i = 0; // Initial index of first subarray\n    int j = 0; // Initial index of second subarray\n    int k = left; // Initial index of merged subarray\n\n    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {\n        if (L[i] <= R[j]) {\n            arr[k] = L[i];\n            i++;\n        } else {\n            arr[k] = R[j];\n            j++;\n        }\n        k++;\n    }\n\n    // Copy the remaining elements of L[], if there are any\n    while (i < n1) {\n        arr[k] = L[i];\n        i++;\n        k++;\n    }\n\n    // Copy the remaining elements of R[], if there are any\n    while (j < n2) {\n        arr[k] = R[j];\n        j++;\n        k++;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to implement Merge Sort\nvoid mergeSort(vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {\n    if (left >= right) {\n        return; // Returns recursively\n    }\n    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n    mergeSort(arr, left, mid);\n    mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);\n    merge(arr, left, mid, right);\n}\n\n// Main function\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cout << \"Enter number of elements: \";\n    cin >> n;\n\n    vector<int> arr(n);\n    cout << \"Enter elements:\" << endl;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cin >> arr[i];\n    }\n\n    mergeSort(arr, 0, n - 1);\n\n    cout << \"Sorted array: \";\n    for (int num : arr) {\n        cout << num << \" \";\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Merge Function**:\n    - It takes the array and the indices of the left, middle, and right positions.\n    - It divides the array into two halves, copies them into temporary arrays, and then merges them back into the original array in sorted order.\n\n2. **Merge Sort Function**:\n    - It recursively divides the array into halves until the base case is reached (subarrays of size one).\n    - Then, it merges these halves back using the merge function.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n    - It reads the number of elements and the elements themselves.\n    - It calls the mergeSort function to sort the array.\n    - Finally, it prints the sorted array.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for implementing merge sort in C++.
