        "content": "Ah, you're referring to Madonna's self-titled debut album, \"Madonna,\" which was released in 1983, not 1984. However, it was her second album, \"Like a Virgin,\" released in 1984, that really catapulted her to international superstardom with hits like \"Material Girl.\" But to clarify, \"Material Girl\" is actually from her first album, \"Madonna,\" which came out in 1983. There seems to be a bit of confusion here with the years. Let me check the release dates again to make sure.\n\nOkay, \"Madonna\" was released on July 20, 1983, and \"Like a Virgin\" was released on November 14, 1984. \"Material Girl\" is indeed from the first album, \"Madonna.\" So, if you're referring to the album that included \"Material Girl,\" it's the self-titled \"Madonna\" from 1983. But it was \"Like a Virgin\" in 1984 that solidified her status as a pop icon.\n\nWait, perhaps there's more to this. Let's see\u2014sometimes albums are released in different regions at different times, which might cause confusion with the release years. In the U.S., \"Madonna\" was released in 1983, but in the UK, it was released in early 1984. So, if you're considering the international release, it might have been seen as a 1984 release in some countries.\n\nMoreover, \"Material Girl\" was released as a single in some regions in 1984, which might be why there's confusion about the year. For instance, in the UK, \"Material Girl\" was released as a single in May 1984, promoting the album which had already come out in the U.S. the previous year.\n\nSo, to answer your question precisely: The self-titled album \"Madonna\" by Madonna was released in 1983 in the U.S. and in early 1984 in the UK. \"Material Girl\" is a track from that album and was released as a single in some regions in 1984. It was this album and its singles, including \"Material Girl,\" that began Madonna's rise to international stardom, which was further solidified by her subsequent album \"Like a Virgin\" in 1984.\n\nBut if we're strictly talking about the self-titled album and the song \"Material Girl,\" it's from the 1983 album \"Madonna,\" although its impact and success continued into 1984, especially in international markets.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Album: \"Madonna\" (self-titled)\n\n- Artist: Madonna\n\n- Release Year: 1983 (U.S.), early 1984 (UK)\n\n- Notable Single: \"Material Girl\"\n\n- Further Success: \"Like a Virgin\" (1984) solidified her status as a pop icon.\n\nI hope this clarifies things for you!"
