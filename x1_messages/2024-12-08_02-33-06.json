        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you set up a Node.js Express server with two endpoints: one for uploading images and another for retrieving all uploaded images. We'll use Multer middleware to handle the file uploads and ensure that only JPEG and PNG images are accepted. Finally, we'll create an endpoint to list all uploaded images with their filenames and sizes in a JSON array.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n## Step 1: Initialize the Project\n\nCreate a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir image-upload-server\ncd image-upload-server\n```\n\nInitialize a new Node.js project:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis will create a `package.json` file with default settings.\n\n## Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nWe need to install Express and Multer. Express is a minimal web framework for Node.js, and Multer is a middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is used for uploading files.\n\nInstall them using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express multer\n```\n\n## Step 3: Set Up the Express Server\n\nCreate a new file called `server.js` and set up the basic structure of the Express server.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst multer = require('multer');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\n// Directory to store uploaded images\nconst uploadDir = 'uploads';\nif (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {\n  fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir);\n}\n\n// Multer storage configuration\nconst storage = multer.diskStorage({\n  destination: (req, file, cb) => {\n    cb(null, uploadDir);\n  },\n  filename: (req, file, cb) => {\n    cb(null, Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname)); // Append file extension\n  },\n});\n\n// File filter for images only\nconst fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {\n  const allowedTypes = /image\\/(jpeg|png)/;\n  if (allowedTypes.test(file.mimetype)) {\n    cb(null, true);\n  } else {\n    cb(new Error('Invalid file type. Only JPEG and PNG images are allowed.'), false);\n  }\n};\n\n// Multer upload instance\nconst upload = multer({ storage, fileFilter });\n\n// Endpoint for uploading images\napp.post('/upload', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {\n  if (!req.file) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'No file uploaded.' });\n  }\n  res.json({ message: 'File uploaded successfully.', file: req.file });\n});\n\n// Endpoint for retrieving all uploaded images\napp.get('/images', (req, res) => {\n  fs.readdir(uploadDir, (err, files) => {\n    if (err) {\n      return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error reading uploaded images.' });\n    }\n    const images = files.map(file => ({\n      filename: file,\n      size: fs.statSync(path.join(uploadDir, file)).size,\n    }));\n    res.json(images);\n  });\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Project Initialization and Dependencies**:\n   - We initialize a new Node.js project and install Express and Multer.\n\n2. **Express Server Setup**:\n   - We set up a basic Express server listening on port 3000.\n   - We create an `uploads` directory to store the uploaded images.\n\n3. **Multer Configuration**:\n   - We configure Multer to store uploaded files in the `uploads` directory.\n   - We set a filename using the current timestamp to avoid filename conflicts.\n   - We define a file filter to accept only JPEG and PNG images.\n\n4. **Upload Endpoint**:\n   - We create a POST endpoint `/upload` that accepts a single file with the form field name `image`.\n   - If the file is successfully uploaded, it returns a JSON response with the file details.\n\n5. **Retrieve Images Endpoint**:\n   - We create a GET endpoint `/images` that reads the `uploads` directory and returns a JSON array of filenames and their sizes.\n\n## Running the Server\n\nTo run the server, execute the following command in your project directory:\n\n```bash\nnode server.js\n```\n\nYour server should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n\n## Testing the Endpoints\n\nYou can test the endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.\n\n### Upload an Image\n\n- **Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:3000/upload`\n- **Body**: `form-data` with a key `image` and select the file to upload.\n\n### Retrieve Uploaded Images\n\n- **Endpoint**: `GET http://localhost:3000/images`\n- **Response**: A JSON array of objects containing `filename` and `size` of each uploaded image.\n\nThat's it! You now have a simple image upload and retrieval server using Node.js, Express, and Multer.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for better user feedback.\n- **File Size Limits**: Add limits to control the size of uploaded files.\n- **Security**: Implement security measures like input validation and protection against overposting.\n- **Scalability**: For production use, consider using cloud storage services for better scalability and reliability.\n\nThis setup provides a solid foundation for handling image uploads and retrievals in a Node.js application."
