        "content": "So, Peter has his new drone in the park, showing it off to his friends Mary and Harry. He flies it around for a bit and then lands it on a picnic table near some trees. Now, while he's not paying attention, Mary decides to play a joke and moves the drone to another table closer to the playground. Later on, a gust of wind blows a red Frisbee onto that table, and it partially covers the drone.\n\nSo, when Peter goes to retrieve his drone, he's probably going back to where he last remember leaving it, which is the first picnic table near the trees. But since it's not there, he's going to think that it's missing or maybe got stolen or lost somehow. He might start looking around, maybe asking his friends if they've seen it.\n\nGiven that Mary moved it as a joke, she might be trying to contain her laughter or act innocent. Harry, depending on whether he knows about Mary's joke or not, might be clueless or trying to help Peter find the drone.\n\nNow, when Peter doesn't find it at the original spot, he might start to worry. He might think that someone took it, or maybe it flew away if there was a strong wind, although he thought he landed it properly.\n\nMeanwhile, the drone is actually at the second table, closer to the playground, partially covered by this red Frisbee that blew over due to the wind.\n\nSo, Peter is probably confused and maybe a bit anxious about his drone being missing. He might start searching the area, maybe following any footprints or signs that could lead him to where it is now.\n\nAlternatively, if he happens to walk by the second table, he might see the Frisbee and notice the drone underneath it. In that case, he might realize that someone moved it, and possibly figure out that it was Mary's joke.\n\nBut since the Frisbee is covering it partially, maybe he wouldn't see it immediately and would have to look closer.\n\nOverall, Peter is likely to be surprised and maybe a little frustrated, especially if he doesn't find it right away. But since it's just a joke by Mary, and the drone is safe, it should all work out in the end.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Peter thinks his drone is missing or lost, possibly worrying about it being stolen or blown away by the wind, unaware that Mary moved it as a joke and it's now partially covered by a red Frisbee on another table.}} \\]"
