By enriching the English language and exploring universal themes\n\nWhile all the options have some connection to Shakespeare's work, option D most accurately captures his primary influence on modern literature. Shakespeare's contribution to the English language is immense; he coined numerous phrases and words that are still in use today. His plays delve into universal themes that transcend time and culture, making his works relevant even in the modern era. While iambic pentameter was a common meter in his time, and he did write tragicomedies, his broader impact lies in language enrichment and thematic depth."
