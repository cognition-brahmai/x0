        "content": "To address the user's request to filter out emails containing the word 'promotion' received after January 1, 2022, I need to select the appropriate function and set the right parameters. Looking at the available functions, there's \"csv_analytics\" and \"email_filter\". Since the task is about filtering emails based on a specific keyword and a date, the \"email_filter\" function seems more suitable.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the parameters required for the \"email_filter\" function. According to the description, it accepts two main parameters: \"keyword\" and \"date_range\". The \"keyword\" parameter is straightforward; it's the word or phrase to look for in the email content. In this case, the keyword is \"promotion\".\n\nNext, the \"date_range\" parameter requires a start date and an end date. The user specified that they want emails received after January 1, 2022. Since there's no mention of an end date, it's likely that the user wants emails from January 1, 2022, up to the present date. However, the \"date_range\" parameter expects both start and end dates to be provided. To handle this, I might need to set the end date to a future date or perhaps use a special value to indicate \"now\" or \"current date\". But since the available functions don't specify how to handle an open-ended date range, I'll assume that setting the start_date to \"2022-01-01\" and not providing an end_date will filter emails from that date onward. Alternatively, if the function requires both dates, I might need to set the end_date to a far future date.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with setting the start_date to \"2022-01-01\" and omitting the end_date, assuming the function can handle it that way. If that's not the case, I might need to adjust this approach.\n\nSo, summarizing, the function to use is \"email_filter\" with the following parameters:\n\n- keyword: promotion\n\n- date_range:\n\n  - start_date: 2022-01-01\n\n  - end_date: not provided (or set to a future date, depending on function requirements)\n\nNow, I need to format this in YAML format as per the instruction.\n\nTherefore, the YAML response would look like this:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: email_filter\nparams:\n  keyword: promotion\n  date_range:\n    start_date: 2022-01-01\n```\n\nI should also consider if the function requires the end_date to be specified. If it does, I might need to set it to a very future date like \"2099-12-31\" to simulate no end date.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function has a way to specify \"no end date\" or \"up to current date\". Since that's not specified in the function description, I'll proceed with omitting the end_date.\n\nIt's important to ensure that the date format is correct and matches what the function expects. In this case, \"2022-01-01\" is a standard ISO 8601 date format, which is widely used and should be acceptable.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the keyword is correctly specified. The user wants emails containing the word 'promotion', so setting the keyword to \"promotion\" should suffice.\n\nI should also consider if the function is case-sensitive or if it can handle variations of the keyword, like \"Promotion\" or \"promotional\". If case sensitivity is a concern, I might need to adjust the keyword accordingly or check if the function has options for case-insensitive searching. However, based on the provided function description, there's no mention of case sensitivity, so I'll assume it's case-insensitive.\n\nAdditionally, the user might want to filter based on the body of the email, the subject, or both. The function description says \"look for in the email content,\" which could encompass both subject and body. If the function allows specifying the part of the email to search, I should include that parameter. But since it's not listed in the available parameters, I'll assume it searches the entire email content.\n\nLastly, I should ensure that the function returns the filtered emails in a format that's useful to the user. The description doesn't specify the output format, so I'll have to assume that it returns the filtered emails in a list or some readable format.\n\nIn conclusion, the appropriate function to use is \"email_filter\" with the specified parameters in YAML format as shown above."
