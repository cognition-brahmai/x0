        "content": "Yes, tomato juice can help neutralize the odor of a skunk. Skunk spray contains sulfur compounds that are responsible for its strong, unpleasant smell. Tomato juice contains acidic compounds that can help break down these sulfur compounds, making the smell less potent. However, it's important to note that tomato juice may not completely eliminate the odor, but it can significantly reduce it. For more effective results, you can also try using a mixture of baking soda and vinegar, or a commercial skunk odor remover."
