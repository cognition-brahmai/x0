        "content": "So I have this problem here: solve the wave equation \\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\) for a string of length \\(L\\), with initial displacement \\(g(x)\\) and initial velocity \\(h(x)\\). Okay, let's see. The wave equation describes how waves propagate through space and time, and in this case, it's for a string, like a guitar string or something similar.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the wave equation is and what each term represents. The term \\(u_{tt}\\) is the second partial derivative of \\(u\\) with respect to time \\(t\\), which represents the acceleration of the string at point \\(x\\) and time \\(t\\). The term \\(u_{xx}\\) is the second partial derivative with respect to position \\(x\\), which represents the curvature of the string at that point. The constant \\(c^2\\) is related to the tension and linear density of the string, determining how fast the wave travels.\n\nSo, the equation \\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\) essentially says that the acceleration of the string at any point is proportional to the curvature at that point, which makes sense because the string wants to straighten out any curvature, causing it to oscillate.\n\nNow, to solve this partial differential equation, I need to consider the boundary conditions and initial conditions. For a string of length \\(L\\), typically, the ends are fixed, meaning that \\(u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0\\) for all time \\(t\\). This makes sense because in a guitar, for example, the ends of the string are attached and don't move.\n\nThe initial conditions are given by the initial displacement \\(g(x)\\) and the initial velocity \\(h(x)\\). So, at time \\(t=0\\), the position of the string is \\(u(x,0) = g(x)\\), and the initial velocity is \\(u_t(x,0) = h(x)\\).\n\nTo solve this, I think the method of separation of variables would be appropriate. This method assumes that the solution can be written as a product of functions of each variable, in this case, \\(u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\\). Let's try that.\n\nSubstituting \\(u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\\) into the wave equation:\n\n\\[\nX(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\(c^2 X(x)T(t)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\n\\]\n\nSince the left side depends only on \\(t\\) and the right side depends only on \\(x\\), they must both be equal to a constant, say \\(-\\lambda\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. \\(X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0\\)\n\n2. \\(T''(t) + \\lambda c^2 T(t) = 0\\)\n\nNow, we need to solve these ODEs with the given boundary and initial conditions.\n\nFirst, consider the spatial equation:\n\n\\[\nX''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0, \\quad X(0) = 0, \\quad X(L) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem. The solutions depend on the value of \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n**Case 1: \\(\\lambda > 0\\)**\n\nLet \\(\\lambda = \\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega > 0\\). The general solution is:\n\n\\[\nX(x) = A \\sin(\\omega x) + B \\cos(\\omega x)\n\\]\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n1. \\(X(0) = A \\sin(0) + B \\cos(0) = B = 0\\)\n\n2. \\(X(L) = A \\sin(\\omega L) = 0\\)\n\nSince \\(A\\) cannot be zero (trivial solution), we must have \\(\\sin(\\omega L) = 0\\), which implies \\(\\omega L = n\\pi\\) for \\(n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\).\n\nThus, \\(\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\) and \\(\\lambda_n = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2\\).\n\nSo, the eigenfunctions are \\(X_n(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\).\n\n**Case 2: \\(\\lambda = 0\\)**\n\nThe equation becomes \\(X''(x) = 0\\), with general solution \\(X(x) = Ax + B\\).\n\nApplying boundary conditions:\n\n1. \\(X(0) = B = 0\\)\n\n2. \\(X(L) = AL = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(A = 0\\)\n\nSo, only the trivial solution, which is not useful.\n\n**Case 3: \\(\\lambda < 0\\)**\n\nLet \\(\\lambda = -\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega > 0\\). The general solution is:\n\n\\[\nX(x) = A e^{\\omega x} + B e^{-\\omega x}\n\\]\n\nApplying boundary conditions:\n\n1. \\(X(0) = A + B = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(B = -A\\)\n\n2. \\(X(L) = A e^{\\omega L} - A e^{-\\omega L} = A (e^{\\omega L} - e^{-\\omega L}) = 0\\)\n\nFor non-trivial solutions (\\(A \\neq 0\\)), we need \\(e^{\\omega L} - e^{-\\omega L} = 0\\), which implies \\(e^{2\\omega L} = 1\\). The only real solution is \\(\\omega = 0\\), which brings us back to the \\(\\lambda = 0\\) case.\n\nTherefore, only \\(\\lambda > 0\\) gives non-trivial solutions, with \\(\\lambda_n = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2\\) and \\(X_n(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\) for \\(n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\).\n\nNow, consider the temporal equation for each \\(\\lambda_n\\):\n\n\\[\nT''(t) + \\lambda_n c^2 T(t) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation, with solution:\n\n\\[\nT_n(t) = A_n \\cos(c \\omega_n t) + B_n \\sin(c \\omega_n t)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\).\n\nTherefore, the general solution for each mode \\(n\\) is:\n\n\\[\nu_n(x,t) = \\left(A_n \\cos(c \\omega_n t) + B_n \\sin(c \\omega_n t)\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe overall solution is a sum over all modes:\n\n\\[\nu(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(A_n \\cos(c \\omega_n t) + B_n \\sin(c \\omega_n t)\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the coefficients \\(A_n\\) and \\(B_n\\) using the initial conditions.\n\nFirst, apply the initial displacement condition:\n\n\\[\nu(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = g(x)\n\\]\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, so the coefficients \\(A_n\\) are given by:\n\n\\[\nA_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} g(x) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nNext, apply the initial velocity condition:\n\n\\[\nu_t(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c \\omega_n B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = h(x)\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c \\frac{n\\pi}{L} B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = h(x)\n\\]\n\nAgain, this is a Fourier sine series, so the coefficients are:\n\n\\[\nc \\frac{n\\pi}{L} B_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} h(x) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nB_n = \\frac{2}{c n \\pi} \\int_{0}^{L} h(x) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together, the solution to the wave equation is:\n\n\\[\nu(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ A_n \\cos\\left(c \\frac{n\\pi}{L} t\\right) + B_n \\sin\\left(c \\frac{n\\pi}{L} t\\right) \\right] \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nA_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} g(x) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nB_n = \\frac{2}{c n \\pi} \\int_{0}^{L} h(x) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThis is the general solution for the wave equation with the given boundary and initial conditions.\n\n**Alternative Approach: D'Alembert's Formula**\n\nAnother way to solve the wave equation is by using d'Alembert's formula, which is particularly useful for infinite or semi-infinite strings without boundaries. However, since we have a finite string with fixed ends, the method of separation of variables is more appropriate here. D'Alembert's formula would require extending the initial conditions to the entire real line in a way that satisfies the boundary conditions, which can be more complicated.\n\n**Numerical Methods**\n\nFor more complex initial conditions or when an analytical solution is not feasible, numerical methods such as finite difference methods or finite element methods can be employed to approximate the solution to the wave equation.\n\n**Energy Conservation**\n\nIt's worth noting that the wave equation conserves energy. The total energy of the string, which is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, remains constant over time unless external forces are applied. This can be used to check the validity of the solution.\n\n**Applications**\n\nThe wave equation has numerous applications in physics and engineering, such as in acoustics, electromagnetics, and quantum mechanics. In the context of strings, it describes the vibration of strings in musical instruments, which is fundamental to the production of sound.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the wave equation for a string of length \\(L\\) with fixed ends and given initial displacement and velocity can be solved using the method of separation of variables, leading to a Fourier series solution in terms of the eigenfunctions of the spatial part of the equation. The coefficients of the series are determined by the initial conditions through Fourier sine series integrals.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nFor a deeper understanding, you may want to refer to textbooks on partial differential equations, such as \"Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction\" by Walter A. Strauss or \"Applied Partial Differential Equations\" by Richard Haberman. These books provide detailed explanations and additional methods for solving the wave equation and other PDEs."
