It finds a list of sites that may have the answer.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkGatherer[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nAIAnswerBot[input]: A question-answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are the benefits and drawbacks of nuclear energy?"
