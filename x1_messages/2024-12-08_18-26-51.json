        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of fruits being sold: apples and oranges. Apples cost $1.50 per pound, and oranges cost $2.00 per pound. The customer buys a total of 12 pounds of fruit and spends $22.50. We need to find out how many pounds of each type of fruit they bought.\n\nFirst, I think it would be helpful to define variables for the unknowns. Let's let A represent the pounds of apples and O represent the pounds of oranges. So, A is the number of pounds of apples, and O is the number of pounds of oranges.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the total weight of the fruits is 12 pounds. That means:\n\nA + O = 12\n\nAlso, the total cost is $22.50. Since apples cost $1.50 per pound and oranges cost $2.00 per pound, the total cost can be represented as:\n\n1.50A + 2.00O = 22.50\n\nSo now we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. A + O = 12\n\n2. 1.50A + 2.00O = 22.50\n\nI need to solve for A and O. One way to solve this system is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for A:\n\nA = 12 - O\n\nNow, substitute this expression for A into the second equation:\n\n1.50(12 - O) + 2.00O = 22.50\n\nLet's distribute the 1.50:\n\n1.50 * 12 = 18.00\n\n1.50 * (-O) = -1.50O\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n18.00 - 1.50O + 2.00O = 22.50\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n18.00 + ( -1.50O + 2.00O ) = 22.50\n\n-1.50O + 2.00O is 0.50O\n\nSo:\n\n18.00 + 0.50O = 22.50\n\nNow, subtract 18.00 from both sides:\n\n0.50O = 4.50\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.50:\n\nO = 9\n\nSo, the customer bought 9 pounds of oranges.\n\nNow, substitute O back into the first equation to find A:\n\nA + 9 = 12\n\nA = 12 - 9\n\nA = 3\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 3 pounds of apples and 9 pounds of oranges.\n\nLet me double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If apples are $1.50 per pound and oranges are $2.00 per pound, then:\n\n3 pounds of apples would cost 3 * 1.50 = $4.50\n\n9 pounds of oranges would cost 9 * 2.00 = $18.00\n\nTotal cost: 4.50 + 18.00 = $22.50, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, the total weight is 3 + 9 = 12 pounds, which matches the given total.\n\nLooks good to me!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ pounds of apples and } 9 \\text{ pounds of oranges}} \\]"
