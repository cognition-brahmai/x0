        "content": "Let's see. So, there are five friends at a party, and each one shakes hands with every other friend exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nHmm, maybe I can start by thinking about one friend. Let's call him Alex. Alex shakes hands with everyone else, which would be four handshakes because there are five friends in total, and he doesn't shake his own hand.\n\nSo, Alex: four handshakes.\n\nNow, let's consider the next friend, let's say Bella. She also shakes hands with everyone else, which would again be four handshakes. But wait, when Bella shakes hands with Alex, that's the same handshake that we already counted when we considered Alex's handshakes. So, if I just add four handshakes for Bella, I'll be double-counting that handshake with Alex.\n\nSo, to avoid double-counting, maybe I should only count the handshakes that Bella has with the other friends who come after her. So, Bella shakes hands with Charlie, Dana, and Eve. That's three new handshakes.\n\nSimilarly, Charlie would shake hands with Dana and Eve, which are two more new handshakes.\n\nThen, Dana shakes hands with Eve, which is one more handshake.\n\nSo, adding them up: Alex: 4, Bella: 3, Charlie: 2, Dana: 1, Eve: 0, because by the time we get to Eve, she has already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nBut wait, if Alex has four, Bella has three, Charlie two, Dana one, and Eve zero, the total would be 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 10 handshakes.\n\nIs there another way to think about this to confirm?\n\nMaybe using combinations. I recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose two items from a set of n items is given by n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nHere, n is 5, since there are five friends.\n\nSo, 5 choose 2 would be 5 times 4 divided by 2, which is 10.\n\nThat matches the earlier total I got by adding up the individual handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it as each friend shaking hands with every other friend exactly once, so it's like forming unique pairs of friends, and each pair corresponds to one handshake.\n\nThe number of unique pairs of five friends is again 5 choose 2, which is 10.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach I take, I end up with 10 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
