        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from Town A to Town B at 60 km/h and comes back at 90 km/h. We need to find the average speed for the whole journey.\n\nFirst, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Town A and Town B is D kilometers. That means the total distance for the round trip is 2D kilometers.\n\nNow, for the trip from A to B at 60 km/h, the time taken would be distance divided by speed, so D / 60 hours.\n\nFor the return trip from B to A at 90 km/h, the time taken would be D / 90 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is D / 60 + D / 90 hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180. So,\n\nD / 60 = (D * 3) / 180 = 3D / 180\n\nD / 90 = (D * 2) / 180 = 2D / 180\n\nTherefore, total time = 3D / 180 + 2D / 180 = 5D / 180 = D / 36 hours.\n\nNow, total distance is 2D kilometers, and total time is D / 36 hours.\n\nSo, average speed = total distance / total time = 2D / (D / 36) = 2D * (36 / D) = 72 km/h.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But I recall that the average of two speeds is not simply the arithmetic mean. Let me double-check.\n\nIf I take the arithmetic mean of 60 and 90, that would be (60 + 90) / 2 = 75 km/h, but my calculation gave me 72 km/h. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the harmonic mean because we're dealing with rates. The harmonic mean for two speeds is 2ab / (a + b), where a and b are the speeds.\n\nSo, harmonic mean = 2 * 60 * 90 / (60 + 90) = 2 * 5400 / 150 = 10800 / 150 = 72 km/h.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed is 72 km/h.\n\nBut why is it different from the arithmetic mean? Well, because the time spent on each leg of the trip is different due to different speeds. The slower speed means more time is spent on that leg, weighting it more heavily.\n\nLet me consider an example to verify. Suppose the distance D is 180 km.\n\nTime from A to B: 180 / 60 = 3 hours\n\nTime from B to A: 180 / 90 = 2 hours\n\nTotal time: 3 + 2 = 5 hours\n\nTotal distance: 180 * 2 = 360 km\n\nAverage speed: 360 / 5 = 72 km/h\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the harmonic mean formula, it also gives 72 km/h.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 72 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
