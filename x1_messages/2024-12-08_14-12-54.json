        "content": "So we have three friends who are splitting the cost of a $90 hotel room. But one friend decides to pay an extra $10 to cover more of the cost. We need to figure out how much each friend pays.\n\nFirst, let's understand the total cost and how it's being shared. The hotel room costs $90 in total. Normally, if they split it equally, each friend would pay $90 divided by 3, which is $30 each.\n\nHowever, one friend is paying an extra $10. So, instead of paying $30, this friend will pay $30 plus $10, which is $40.\n\nNow, if one friend is paying $40, and the other two are paying the usual $30 each, let's add that up to make sure it covers the total cost.\n\nSo, $40 (from the one friend) plus $30 (from the second friend) plus $30 (from the third friend) equals $100.\n\nWait a minute, the hotel room only costs $90, but according to this, they're paying a total of $100. That's $10 more than the actual cost.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in this approach. Maybe the extra $10 should be distributed differently.\n\nLet me think differently. If one friend is paying extra $10, perhaps the total amount being paid is still $90, but one friend is covering more of the cost.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if one friend pays extra $10, the total payment would be more than $90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra $10 is to tip or for some other expense, but the question seems to indicate that it's for covering more of the cost of the room itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intention is that one friend pays more, and the others pay less, but the total remains $90.\n\nIn that case, let's denote the amounts paid by the three friends as A, B, and C, where A = B = standard amount, and C = A + $10.\n\nSo, A + B + C = $90.\n\nBut since C = A + $10, and B = A, we can substitute:\n\nA + A + (A + $10) = $90.\n\nThat simplifies to 3A + $10 = $90.\n\nSubtracting $10 from both sides: 3A = $80.\n\nThen, A = $80 / 3 \u2248 $26.67.\n\nSo, A and B each pay approximately $26.67, and C pays $26.67 + $10 = $36.67.\n\nLet's check if this adds up: $26.67 + $26.67 + $36.67 = $90.\n\nWait, actually, $26.67 times 2 is $53.34, plus $36.67 is $90.01, which is close enough to $90, considering rounding.\n\nSo, each of two friends pays about $26.67, and the third pays about $36.67.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid rounding, we can express $80 divided by 3 as $26 and 2/3, or $26.666..., and $36.666..., but in practice, they would likely round to cents.\n\nSo, to be precise, A and B pay $26.67 each, and C pays $36.66, because $26.67 + $26.67 + $36.66 = $90 exactly.\n\nAlternatively, one could pay $26.66, another $26.67, and the third $36.67, but the total would still be $90.\n\nSo, the answer is that two friends pay $26.67 each, and one friend pays $36.66.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\$26.67, \\$26.67, \\$36.66} \\]"
