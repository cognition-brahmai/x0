However, I can tell you that in Australia, children are taught about the importance of the country's unique wildlife, such as kangaroos, koalas, and the Great Barrier Reef. They also learn about the history of the land, including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who have inhabited the continent for thousands of years. These are some of the fundamental facts that Australian children grow up knowing."
