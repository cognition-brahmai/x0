        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city is starting a bike-sharing program and they've got an initial investment of $2 million. Each bike costs $500 to buy, and on top of that, there's an extra $100 per bike for maintenance and administrative expenses. We need to find out two things: first, the maximum number of bikes they can purchase with that $2 million, considering both the purchase price and the additional expenses. Second, we need to estimate how many bikes need to be rented out daily to cover the initial investment within one year, assuming each rental brings in $5 per bike per day.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part. The total cost per bike is the purchase price plus the additional expenses. So, that's $500 + $100 = $600 per bike. Now, with a $2 million budget, we need to see how many bikes can be bought at $600 each.\n\nFirst, let's convert $2 million into dollars for clarity. $2 million is $2,000,000. Now, divide that by the cost per bike:\n\nNumber of bikes = Total budget / Cost per bike\nNumber of bikes = $2,000,000 / $600\n\nLet me do that calculation. 2,000,000 divided by 600.\n\nWell, 600 times 3,000 is 1,800,000. Subtract that from 2,000,000, and we have 200,000 left. 600 times 300 is 180,000. So, 3,300 bikes would cost 3,300 times 600, which is 1,800,000 plus 180,000, totaling 1,980,000. That leaves us with 2,000,000 - 1,980,000 = 20,000.\n\nCan we buy another bike with the remaining 20,000? Well, one bike costs 600, so 20,000 divided by 600 is approximately 33.33. So, we can buy an additional 33 bikes with the remaining money.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bikes that can be purchased is 3,300 + 33 = 3,333 bikes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Let's calculate it directly:\n\nNumber of bikes = $2,000,000 / $600 \u2248 3,333.333\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bike, we'll round down to 3,333 bikes.\n\nNow, let's confirm the total cost for 3,333 bikes:\n\nTotal cost = 3,333 bikes * $600/bike = $1,999,800\n\nThat's $1,999,800, which is within the $2,000,000 budget. The remaining $200 isn't enough to buy another bike, so 3,333 is the maximum number of bikes that can be purchased.\n\nOkay, now moving on to the second part. We need to estimate the number of bikes that need to be rented out daily to cover the initial investment within one year, assuming a rental fee of $5 per bike per day.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total revenue needed to cover the initial investment within one year. The initial investment is $2,000,000, and we want to cover that in one year.\n\nAssuming one year has 365 days, we can calculate the daily revenue required:\n\nDaily revenue required = Total investment / Number of days in a year\nDaily revenue required = $2,000,000 / 365\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n$2,000,000 \u00f7 365 \u2248 $5,479.45 per day\n\nSo, we need approximately $5,479.45 in daily revenue to cover the initial investment in one year.\n\nNow, each bike rented out per day brings in $5. Therefore, the number of bikes that need to be rented out daily can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of bikes to rent daily = Daily revenue required / Rental fee per bike\nNumber of bikes to rent daily = $5,479.45 / $5\n\nLet's do that division:\n\n$5,479.45 \u00f7 $5 = 1,095.89 bikes\n\nSince we can't rent out a fraction of a bike, we'll need to round up to the next whole number. So, approximately 1,096 bikes need to be rented out daily to cover the initial investment within one year.\n\nBut wait a minute, we have 3,333 bikes available. Is it feasible to rent out 1,096 bikes daily? Well, that would depend on the demand for bikes in the city. However, based on the numbers given, that's the figure we arrive at.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total cost per bike: $500 (purchase) + $100 (maintenance and admin) = $600 per bike.\n\nNumber of bikes: $2,000,000 / $600 = 3,333 bikes.\n\nDaily revenue required: $2,000,000 / 365 \u2248 $5,479.45.\n\nNumber of bikes to rent daily: $5,479.45 / $5 \u2248 1,095.89, which rounds up to 1,096 bikes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The maximum number of bikes that can be purchased with the initial investment is 3,333 bikes.\n\n- To cover the initial investment within one year, approximately 1,096 bikes need to be rented out daily at a rate of $5 per bike per day.\n\nI hope this helps!
