        "content": "Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x - 2}{2} + 3 = 7\\]\n\nFirst, I need to isolate the term with the variable \\(x\\). To do that, I can start by getting rid of the constant term on the left side. The constant term added is 3, so I'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x - 2}{2} + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x - 2}{2} = 4\\]\n\nNow, I have \\(\\frac{4x - 2}{2} = 4\\). To eliminate the denominator, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[2 \\times \\frac{4x - 2}{2} = 4 \\times 2\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[4x - 2 = 8\\]\n\nNext, I need to isolate the term with \\(x\\). There's a constant term -2 on the left side, so I'll add 2 to both sides:\n\n\\[4x - 2 + 2 = 8 + 2\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[4x = 10\\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\(x\\), I need to divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x}{4} = \\frac{10}{4}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{10}{4}\\]\n\nI can reduce this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{5}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the solution is \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\nTo make sure this is correct, I can plug \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\) back into the original equation and see if both sides equal 7.\n\nStarting with the left side:\n\n\\[\\frac{4 \\times \\frac{5}{2} - 2}{2} + 3\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(4 \\times \\frac{5}{2}\\):\n\n\\[4 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = 2 \\times 5 = 10\\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{10 - 2}{2} + 3\\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{8}{2} + 3 \\]\n\n\\[4 + 3 = 7\\]\n\nYes, it matches the right side of the equation. So, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{2}} \\]"
