        "content": "So Alice can paint a room in 5 hours, and Bob can do it in 7 hours. They start painting together at 9 AM, and I need to find out when they'll finish.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how fast they paint together. Maybe I can add their rates or something.\n\nLet me think about how much each paints per hour.\n\nAlice paints the whole room in 5 hours, so her rate is 1 room per 5 hours, which is 1/5 of the room per hour.\n\nBob paints the whole room in 7 hours, so his rate is 1 room per 7 hours, which is 1/7 of the room per hour.\n\nIf they work together, their combined rate should be the sum of their individual rates, right?\n\nSo, combined rate = 1/5 + 1/7.\n\nI need to add those fractions. To add them, I need a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are 5 and 7. The least common multiple of 5 and 7 is 35.\n\nSo, 1/5 is equal to 7/35, and 1/7 is equal to 5/35.\n\nAdding them up: 7/35 + 5/35 = 12/35.\n\nSo, together, they paint 12/35 of the room per hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many hours it takes for them to paint the whole room at that rate.\n\nIf they paint 12/35 of the room per hour, then the time to paint the whole room is 1 divided by their combined rate, which is 1 / (12/35) = 35/12 hours.\n\n35/12 hours is the same as 2 11/12 hours, which is 2 hours and 55 minutes (since 11/12 of an hour is 55 minutes).\n\nSo, they take 2 hours and 55 minutes to paint the room together.\n\nNow, they start at 9 AM. Adding 2 hours brings us to 11 AM. Then adding 55 minutes brings us to 11:55 AM.\n\nTherefore, they should finish painting at 11:55 AM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nPerhaps I can find how much of the room each paints in a certain time and see when it adds up to 1 room.\n\nFor example, after t hours, Alice paints (1/5)t of the room, and Bob paints (1/7)t of the room.\n\nTogether, they paint (1/5)t + (1/7)t = (12/35)t of the room.\n\nSet that equal to 1 room: (12/35)t = 1.\n\nThen, t = 35/12 hours, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, 35/12 hours is approximately 2.9167 hours, which is 2 hours and 0.9167 * 60 minutes, which is about 55 minutes.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, starting at 9 AM, adding 2 hours brings us to 11 AM, and then 55 minutes brings us to 11:55 AM.\n\nTherefore, they finish at 11:55 AM.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11:55 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
