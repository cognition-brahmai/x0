        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges $20 per day and $0.10 per mile. So, if someone rents a car for 3 days and drives it for 150 miles, we need to calculate both the daily charge and the mileage charge, then add them together to find the total cost.\n\nFirst, the daily charge: $20 per day for 3 days. That should be $20 multiplied by 3.\n\n$20 * 3 = $60.\n\nNext, the mileage charge: $0.10 per mile for 150 miles. That's $0.10 multiplied by 150.\n\n$0.10 * 150 = $15.\n\nNow, add the two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\n$60 + $15 = $75.\n\nSo, the total amount they will pay is $75.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. The daily charge seems straightforward: $20 per day for 3 days is indeed $60. For the mileage, $0.10 per mile for 150 miles: $0.10 times 150 is $15. Adding them up gives $75. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes companies might have additional fees, but based on the information provided, it's just the daily rate and the mileage rate. So, no need to consider any extra charges.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total cost as a function of days and miles. Let\u2019s denote the number of days as d and the number of miles as m. Then, the total cost C is:\n\nC = 20d + 0.10m\n\nPlugging in d = 3 and m = 150:\n\nC = 20*3 + 0.10*150 = 60 + 15 = 75\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, the final answer is $75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
