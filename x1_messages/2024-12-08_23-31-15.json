        "content": "So, the car can travel 150 miles on a full tank, and it gets 25 miles per gallon. I need to find out how many gallons the gas tank holds.\n\nAlright, let's see. If the car gets 25 miles per gallon, that means for every gallon of gas, it can travel 25 miles. And the whole tank allows it to go 150 miles. So, I think I need to figure out how many 25-mile segments there are in 150 miles. That should give me the number of gallons.\n\nSo, I can divide the total miles by the miles per gallon to find the gallons. That is, 150 miles divided by 25 miles per gallon.\n\nLet me do the math: 150 divided by 25 is 6. So, the tank holds 6 gallons.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If the car gets 25 miles per gallon and the tank holds 6 gallons, then 25 times 6 is 150 miles. Yeah, that matches the original statement.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of multiplication. If I let g be the number of gallons in the tank, then 25 miles per gallon times g gallons should equal 150 miles. So, 25g = 150. Then, solving for g, I divide both sides by 25, which again gives g = 6.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. I think 6 gallons is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is the car's mileage constant? Yes, it's given as 25 miles per gallon. Is there any mention of different conditions or variations? No, so I don't need to account for anything extra.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Miles and miles per gallon are consistent, and the result is in gallons, which is what's being asked.\n\nSo, I believe 6 gallons is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
