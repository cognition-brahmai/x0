        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 apples in the basket, and each apple weighs 120 grams. So, to find the total weight of all the apples initially, I would multiply the number of apples by the weight of each apple. That is:\n\n5 apples * 120 grams/apple = 600 grams\n\nNow, if I eat one apple, that means there are 4 apples left in the basket. To find the total weight of the remaining apples, I can multiply the number of remaining apples by the weight of each apple:\n\n4 apples * 120 grams/apple = 480 grams\n\nSo, the total weight of the remaining apples in the basket is 480 grams.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of recalculating the total weight after eating one apple, I could subtract the weight of the eaten apple from the initial total weight. Let's try that.\n\nInitial total weight: 5 apples * 120 grams/apple = 600 grams\n\nWeight of the eaten apple: 120 grams\n\nTherefore, remaining weight: 600 grams - 120 grams = 480 grams\n\nThat gives me the same answer, which is good. It looks like both methods lead to the same result, which increases my confidence that 480 grams is the correct total weight of the remaining apples.\n\nBut let's double-check. If I have 5 apples, each weighing 120 grams, the total weight should indeed be 600 grams. Eating one apple removes 120 grams from the basket, so subtracting that should give me 480 grams. Alternatively, multiplying the remaining 4 apples by 120 grams each also gives 480 grams. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nIs there any other aspect to consider here? For example, could the weight of the basket itself be a factor? The question doesn't mention the weight of the basket, so I assume it's only asking about the weight of the apples. If the basket had a certain weight, that would be additional, but since it's not specified, I can ignore it.\n\nAlso, the question specifies that each apple weighs exactly 120 grams. In reality, apples can vary in weight, but in this problem, they are all uniform, which simplifies the calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick or additional step I might have missed. For instance, is there any information about the apples changing weight after one is eaten? Not that I can see; the problem is straightforward.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total weight of the remaining apples in the basket after eating one is 480 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480 \\text{ grams}} \\]"
