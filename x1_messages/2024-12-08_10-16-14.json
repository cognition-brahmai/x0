        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a spherical ball with a diameter of 12 centimeters, and I need to find its surface area. Okay, first things first, I need to remember the formula for the surface area of a sphere. I think it's something like 4 times pi times the radius squared, but I should double-check that.\n\nLet me recall: the surface area (A) of a sphere is given by A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the sphere. Yeah, that sounds right. So, I have the diameter, which is 12 cm, and I know that the radius is half of the diameter. Therefore, r = d/2 = 12/2 = 6 cm.\n\nNow, plugging the values into the formula: A = 4 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 (6)\u00b2. First, I'll square the radius: 6\u00b2 = 36. Then, multiply by \u03c0: 36\u03c0. And finally, multiply by 4: 4 \u00d7 36\u03c0 = 144\u03c0.\n\nSo, the surface area is 144\u03c0 square centimeters. But maybe I should leave it in terms of \u03c0, or perhaps provide a numerical approximation. Since the problem didn't specify, I'll give both. So, 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2, or approximately 144 \u00d7 3.1416 \u2248 452.39 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there's a more precise value for \u03c0 to use, but generally, 3.1416 is accurate enough for most purposes. Unless specified otherwise, I think this should be fine.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check the formula again. Yeah, the surface area of a sphere is indeed 4\u03c0r\u00b2. And I correctly calculated r from the diameter. So, I think this is correct.\n\nOne more thing: units. The diameter is given in centimeters, so the surface area should be in square centimeters, which I've got. Good.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144\\pi \\text{ cm}^2 \\approx 452.39 \\text{ cm}^2} \\]"
