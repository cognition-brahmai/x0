        "content": "So the garden is rectangular, right? And it's 60 meters long and 40 meters wide. The gardener wants to plant flowers along the perimeter, with one flower every meter. I need to figure out how many flowers are needed.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the perimeter of the garden is. Since it's a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all the sides. For a rectangle, that's two times the length plus two times the width.\n\nSo, perimeter P = 2 * length + 2 * width.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: P = 2 * 60 + 2 * 40 = 120 + 80 = 200 meters.\n\nNow, if the gardener wants to plant one flower every meter along the perimeter, then the number of flowers needed should be equal to the perimeter in meters.\n\nTherefore, the gardener will need 200 flowers.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider whether the flowers at the corners are being double-counted or not. In a rectangle, the corners connect two sides, so if I'm placing flowers at every meter, the corner flowers are shared by both sides.\n\nBut in the perimeter calculation, each side is counted separately, so the corners are already accounted for in the total perimeter length.\n\nSo, I think 200 flowers should be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of the number of flowers needed for each side.\n\nFor the length sides: each length is 60 meters, so that's 60 flowers per length side. Since there are two length sides, that's 120 flowers.\n\nFor the width sides: each width is 40 meters, so that's 40 flowers per width side. Since there are two width sides, that's 80 flowers.\n\nAdding them up: 120 + 80 = 200 flowers.\n\nBut again, I'm wondering if the corner flowers are being counted twice this way. Because the end of one side is the start of the next side.\n\nMaybe I should subtract the four corner flowers since they are being double-counted.\n\nSo, total flowers = (120 + 80) - 4 = 196 flowers.\n\nWait, but in the perimeter calculation, the corners are part of both sides, so perhaps subtracting four is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial perimeter calculation of 200 meters already accounts for the corners without double-counting.\n\nLet me think differently. If I imagine walking along the perimeter, starting at one corner and going all the way around back to the starting point, and planting a flower every meter, how many flowers would I plant?\n\nWell, for a 200-meter perimeter, planting one every meter, it should be 200 flowers.\n\nBut in reality, when you plant the last flower at the starting point, it would be the same as the first flower, so maybe it's 199 flowers.\n\nWait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's like a loop, and the starting point is also the ending point, so the number of flowers is equal to the perimeter in meters.\n\nBut in that case, it would still be 200 flowers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's similar to the concept of fencing a garden: the number of posts needed is equal to the number of intervals between them plus one, if it's a closed loop.\n\nWait, in fencing, if you have a closed loop, the number of posts is equal to the number of intervals.\n\nBecause the first post and the last post are the same.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of flowers would be equal to the perimeter in meters, which is 200.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.\n\nMaybe I should consider a smaller example to see.\n\nSuppose the garden is 2 meters by 1 meter.\n\nPerimeter would be 2*2 + 2*1 = 6 meters.\n\nIf planting one flower every meter, how many flowers?\n\nWell, starting at one corner, plant flower 1, then walk 1 meter to the next point, plant flower 2, and so on, until returning to the starting point.\n\nSo, flowers would be planted at 0m, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, and back to 0m.\n\nBut the starting point already has a flower, so I don't need to plant an additional one there.\n\nSo, total flowers would be 6.\n\nTherefore, in this case, perimeter is 6 meters, and flowers needed are 6.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, perimeter is 200 meters, so flowers needed should be 200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's like the number of intervals between flowers is equal to the perimeter, and since it's a closed loop, the number of flowers equals the number of intervals.\n\nTherefore, 200 flowers.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 200 flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
