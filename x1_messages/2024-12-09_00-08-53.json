        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a factory that produces widgets. Each widget costs $10 to make and sells for $15. There are also fixed costs like rent and utilities that amount to $20,000 per month. The question is, how many widgets must be sold each month to break even. Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what breaking even means. Breaking even is when the total revenue equals the total costs. So, there's no profit and no loss. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the total costs consist of two parts: fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are those that don't change with the number of widgets produced, like rent and utilities, which are $20,000 per month in this case. Variable costs are those that depend on the number of widgets produced, like the cost to make each widget, which is $10 per widget.\n\nSo, if I let \\( x \\) be the number of widgets produced and sold in a month, then:\n\n- The total variable cost is \\( 10x \\) dollars.\n\n- The total cost is fixed costs plus variable costs, which is \\( 20,000 + 10x \\) dollars.\n\n- The revenue from selling \\( x \\) widgets is \\( 15x \\) dollars, since each widget sells for $15.\n\nTo break even, total revenue must equal total costs:\n\n\\[ 15x = 20,000 + 10x \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( x \\). Let's subtract \\( 10x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 15x - 10x = 20,000 + 10x - 10x \\]\n\n\\[ 5x = 20,000 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{20,000}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 4,000 \\]\n\nSo, the factory needs to sell 4,000 widgets per month to break even.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the profit per widget, which is the selling price minus the variable cost per widget. So, that's \\( 15 - 10 = 5 \\) dollars per widget. This means for each widget sold beyond the break-even point, the factory makes $5 profit.\n\nBut to cover the fixed costs of $20,000, I need to see how many widgets' profit can cover that. So, fixed costs divided by profit per widget:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20,000}{5} = 4,000 \\]\n\nSo, again, 4,000 widgets.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, it seems consistent.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the concept of contribution margin or something like that.\n\nYes, the contribution margin is the amount each unit contributes to covering fixed costs after variable costs are covered. So, it's indeed the selling price minus variable cost per unit, which is $5, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, to cover fixed costs, you need to sell enough units so that the contribution margin times the number of units equals fixed costs.\n\nSo, again:\n\n\\[ 5x = 20,000 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 4,000 \\]\n\nSame answer.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other costs that might be involved. Are there any taxes, additional fees, or anything like that mentioned in the problem? No, it only mentions the fixed costs and the variable costs per widget.\n\nAlso, it assumes that all widgets produced are sold, which seems to be the case here, as there's no mention of unsold widgets.\n\nSo, breaking even requires that the revenue from selling the widgets covers both the fixed costs and the variable costs.\n\nI think I've covered all angles here. The calculation seems straightforward, and all methods point to 4,000 widgets needing to be sold to break even.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's plug the number back into the original equation to verify.\n\nTotal costs = fixed costs + variable costs = 20,000 + 10*4,000 = 20,000 + 40,000 = 60,000 dollars.\n\nTotal revenue = 15*4,000 = 60,000 dollars.\n\nYes, they match. So, breaking even at 4,000 widgets.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000} \\]"
