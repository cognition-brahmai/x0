        "content": "So I have this problem here. There's a big square with sides that are 10 cm long. Then, from one corner of this big square, they're cutting out a smaller square that's 4 cm on each side. I need to find out what the area is of the shape that's left after cutting out the smaller square.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on. I have a square, which means all sides are equal, and all angles are 90 degrees. The area of a square is calculated by side squared, right? So, for the big square, the area should be 10 cm times 10 cm, which is 100 square centimeters.\n\nNow, from this big square, I'm cutting out a smaller square that's 4 cm on each side. The area of this smaller square would be 4 cm times 4 cm, which is 16 square centimeters.\n\nTo find the area of the remaining shape, I think I just need to subtract the area of the smaller square from the area of the bigger square. So, that would be 100 square centimeters minus 16 square centimeters, which equals 84 square centimeters.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there's anything else I need to consider. Is there any overlap or something like that? No, because I'm just cutting out a piece from the bigger square. So, the remaining area should indeed be the big area minus the small area.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I have a square that's 10 cm by 10 cm, and I cut out a 4 cm by 4 cm square from one of its corners, what's left is like a big square with a chunk missing from one corner. The missing chunk is the smaller square.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the remaining shape as consisting of three rectangles and two smaller squares, but that seems more complicated. The simplest way is just to subtract the area of the smaller square from the area of the bigger square.\n\nSo, area remaining = area of large square - area of small square = 100 cm\u00b2 - 16 cm\u00b2 = 84 cm\u00b2.\n\nI think that's the answer. But to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the position of the cut-out square affects the area remaining. The problem says the smaller square is cut from one corner, but since area is just a measure of space, and I'm only removing a specific portion, the position might not matter as long as the area removed is the same.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider if I cut the smaller square from the center or from the side. If it were from the center, the remaining shape would look different, but the area removed would still be 16 cm\u00b2, so the remaining area should still be 84 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in this problem, it specifically says to cut from one corner. Does that make a difference? I don't think so, because area is just a measure of space, not of shape or position.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can divide the big square into parts and calculate the area differently.\n\nSuppose I divide the big square into four rectangles: two on either side of the cut-out square. But that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that after cutting out the smaller square, the remaining shape is like the big square with one corner missing.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the area of the remaining shape by adding up the areas of the three rectangles that are left.\n\nWait, if I cut out a 4 cm square from one corner of a 10 cm square, what's left are three rectangles: one that's 10 cm by 6 cm, another that's 6 cm by 4 cm, and another that's 4 cm by 6 cm.\n\nWait, no. Let me try to visualize this properly.\n\nIf I have a big square of 10 cm sides, and I cut out a smaller square of 4 cm from one corner, then the remaining shape can be divided into two rectangles.\n\nOne rectangle would be 10 cm by (10 - 4) cm = 10 cm by 6 cm, and the other would be (10 - 4) cm by 4 cm = 6 cm by 4 cm.\n\nBut wait, that only accounts for two rectangles. Maybe there are more parts.\n\nLet me draw this out. Imagine a big square, 10 cm sides. I cut out a smaller square of 4 cm from one corner. So, from the top-left corner, say, I remove a 4 cm by 4 cm square.\n\nWhat's left is the big square minus the small square. Alternatively, it can be seen as a large rectangle of 10 cm by 6 cm (since 10 - 4 = 6), and another rectangle of 6 cm by 4 cm.\n\nBut if I add those two areas together: (10 cm * 6 cm) + (6 cm * 4 cm) = 60 cm\u00b2 + 24 cm\u00b2 = 84 cm\u00b2, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of how I look at it, the remaining area is 84 cm\u00b2.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if the smaller square isn't completely within the larger square, but that doesn't make sense because the smaller square is 4 cm and the larger is 10 cm, so it fits entirely within the larger square.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the perimeter or something, but the question is only asking for the area of the remaining shape, not anything else.\n\nSo, I think 84 cm\u00b2 is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider the general formula for this kind of problem.\n\nIf you have a square of side length A, and you cut out a square of side length B from one corner, the area of the remaining shape is A\u00b2 - B\u00b2.\n\nIn this case, A is 10 cm and B is 4 cm, so area remaining is 10\u00b2 - 4\u00b2 = 100 - 16 = 84 cm\u00b2.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use integration or some advanced method, but that's unnecessary for this straightforward problem.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to approach this problem, and each method leads me to the same conclusion that the area of the remaining shape is 84 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]"
