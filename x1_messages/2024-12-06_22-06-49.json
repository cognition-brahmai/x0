        "content": "Let's see. There are 6 siblings in the family, and each one has exactly one brother. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky at first, but let's try to figure it out.\n\nSo, if there are 6 siblings, and each has exactly one brother, that means that apart from themselves, there is only one other male sibling. Wait a minute, does that mean there are only two boys in the family?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose there are B boys and G girls in the family, and the total number of siblings is 6, so B + G = 6.\n\nNow, each sibling has exactly one brother. For the boys, their brother would be the other boy in the family, since they have only one brother. For the girls, their brother would also be that same boy.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If there are two boys, then each boy has one brother, which is the other boy. That checks out. And each girl would have one brother, who is one of the boys. So, if there are two boys and four girls, each girl has one brother, and each boy has one brother.\n\nLet me verify that. If there are two boys and four girls:\n\n- Each boy has one brother (the other boy) and four sisters (the girls).\n\n- Each girl has one brother (one of the boys) and three sisters (the other girls).\n\nWait, but according to the problem, each sibling has exactly one brother. In this scenario, the girls have one brother, and the boys have one brother. So, that fits the condition.\n\nAlternatively, if there were more boys, say three boys and three girls:\n\n- Each boy would have two brothers (the other two boys).\n\n- Each girl would have two brothers (the boys).\n\nBut the problem states that each sibling has exactly one brother, so that doesn't fit.\n\nSimilarly, if there was only one boy and five girls:\n\n- The boy would have no brothers, which contradicts the condition that each sibling has one brother.\n\n- Each girl would have one brother, but the boy doesn't have any brothers, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, the only configuration that satisfies the condition is two boys and four girls.\n\nLet me think if there's another possible arrangement. Suppose there are three boys and three girls:\n\n- Each boy would have two brothers, which doesn't match the condition of having exactly one brother.\n\n- Each girl would have two brothers, again not matching the condition.\n\nWhat if there are four boys and two girls:\n\n- Each boy would have three brothers, which is more than one.\n\n- Each girl would have four brothers.\n\nThat doesn't fit either.\n\nSimilarly, one boy and five girls:\n\n- The boy has no brothers.\n\n- Each girl has one brother.\n\nThis doesn't satisfy the condition for the boy.\n\nSo, the only possible arrangement is two boys and four girls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no boys and six girls, but that would mean each girl has no brothers, which again doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the family must consist of two boys and four girls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ boys and } 4 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
