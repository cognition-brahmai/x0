        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: a baker bakes 12 loaves of bread every hour for 8 hours a day. I need to find out how many loaves he bakes in a week. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many loaves he bakes in one day. He bakes 12 loaves every hour and works for 8 hours a day. So, the daily amount would be 12 loaves/hour times 8 hours, right? Let me do that calculation.\n\n12 loaves/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 96 loaves per day.\n\nAlright, so he bakes 96 loaves each day. Now, to find out the weekly total, I need to know how many days he works in a week. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume he works 7 days a week, which is typical for a baker, I guess.\n\nSo, if he bakes 96 loaves per day and works 7 days a week, then the weekly total would be 96 loaves/day times 7 days.\n\n96 loaves/day \u00d7 7 days = 672 loaves per week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. 12 times 8 is indeed 96, and 96 times 7 is 672. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the baker actually works 7 days a week. Maybe he takes one day off, for example. The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should ask for clarification.\n\nActually, in real life, bakers might work 6 or 7 days a week, but since it's not mentioned, maybe I should assume a standard 5-day workweek, like many jobs.\n\nLet me calculate that way too. So, if he works 5 days a week, then:\n\n96 loaves/day \u00d7 5 days = 480 loaves per week.\n\nHmm, but that seems less likely for a baker, as they might need to bake more frequently. Maybe they work 6 days a week.\n\nSo, 96 loaves/day \u00d7 6 days = 576 loaves per week.\n\nStill, without specific information, I'll stick with my initial assumption of 7 days a week, which gives me 672 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a standard 40-hour workweek. If he works 8 hours a day, then 40 hours would be 5 days (since 8 hours/day \u00d7 5 days = 40 hours). So, in that case, it would be 96 loaves/day \u00d7 5 days = 480 loaves per week.\n\nBut again, bakers might work more than 5 days a week, so perhaps 6 days would be more appropriate, leading to 576 loaves per week.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, maybe the problem expects me to assume a certain number of days per week. Perhaps it's safe to assume 7 days a week, resulting in 672 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to test my understanding of multiplication over multiple units of time: hours, days, and weeks.\n\nLet me think about it differently. There are 7 days in a week. He bakes 12 loaves per hour for 8 hours each day.\n\nSo, total loaves per week = 12 loaves/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n12 \u00d7 8 = 96 loaves per day.\n\n96 \u00d7 7 = 672 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply in a different order:\n\n12 loaves/hour \u00d7 7 days/week = 84 loaves per week per hour.\n\nThen, 84 loaves/week/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day = 672 loaves per week.\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe sticking with the first method is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of total hours in a week.\n\nIf he works 8 hours per day for 7 days, that's 8 \u00d7 7 = 56 hours per week.\n\nThen, at 12 loaves per hour, total loaves per week would be 12 \u00d7 56 = 672 loaves.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if he works a standard 40-hour week, then:\n\n12 loaves/hour \u00d7 40 hours = 480 loaves per week.\n\nBut again, without specified days off, I think 7 days a week is a reasonable assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that he doesn't work on weekends, so only 5 days a week.\n\nIn that case, 12 loaves/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day \u00d7 5 days/week = 480 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, if he works 6 days a week, it would be 12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 6 = 576 loaves per week.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity on the number of days worked per week, perhaps the best approach is to stick with the information provided and assume 7 days a week, resulting in 672 loaves per week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing my ability to handle units of time and multiplication.\n\nIn that case, the focus is on correctly multiplying the rates across different time units.\n\nSo, 12 loaves/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 672 loaves/week.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trick involving rest days or varying work hours, but the problem doesn't mention any variations, so assuming a constant 8 hours per day for 7 days seems acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the baker bakes 672 loaves in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{672} \\]"
