        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that 20 workers can produce 1000 widgets in 10 days. Now, we need to find out how many days it would take for 30 workers to produce 1500 widgets, assuming they work at the same rate.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find out the production rate per worker per day. If 20 workers produce 1000 widgets in 10 days, then the total worker-days would be 20 workers times 10 days, which is 200 worker-days. So, 200 worker-days produce 1000 widgets. Therefore, the number of widgets produced per worker-day would be 1000 widgets divided by 200 worker-days, which is 5 widgets per worker-day.\n\nNow, if we have 30 workers, and each worker produces 5 widgets per day, then the total production per day would be 30 workers times 5 widgets per worker-day, which is 150 widgets per day.\n\nWe need to produce 1500 widgets. So, if they produce 150 widgets per day, the number of days required would be 1500 widgets divided by 150 widgets per day, which is 10 days.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check my assumptions. Is the production rate really constant, and are there no constraints or other factors affecting production?\n\nGiven that the problem states \"assuming they work at the same rate,\" I can assume that the production rate per worker per day remains constant. So, my calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of man-days or worker-days to solve this problem. In the first scenario, 20 workers take 10 days to produce 1000 widgets, which is 200 worker-days for 1000 widgets. So, the amount of worker-days needed per widget is 200 divided by 1000, which is 0.2 worker-days per widget.\n\nNow, for 1500 widgets, the total worker-days required would be 1500 widgets times 0.2 worker-days per widget, which is 300 worker-days.\n\nIf we have 30 workers, the number of days required would be 300 worker-days divided by 30 workers, which is again 10 days.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Maybe I'm overthinking this.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors I should account for. For example, is there any learning curve, or does productivity decrease with more workers due to space constraints? The problem doesn't mention any of these, so I assume that each worker contributes equally, regardless of the number of workers.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"assuming they work at the same rate,\" so I don't need to factor in any changes in individual worker productivity.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the total amount of work in terms of widgets and relate it to the number of workers and days.\n\nLet me define the total work as the number of widgets produced. The work done is proportional to the number of workers and the number of days they work, assuming each worker works at the same rate.\n\nSo, we can set up a proportion:\n\nNumber of workers \u00d7 Number of days = Total work (in widget units)\n\nFrom the first scenario:\n\n20 workers \u00d7 10 days = 1000 widgets\n\nFrom the second scenario:\n\n30 workers \u00d7 d days = 1500 widgets\n\nWe can set up a ratio:\n\n(20 workers \u00d7 10 days) / 1000 widgets = (30 workers \u00d7 d days) / 1500 widgets\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n(200) / 1000 = (30d) / 1500\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.2 = 30d / 1500\n\nNow, solve for d:\n\n30d / 1500 = 0.2\n\nMultiply both sides by 1500:\n\n30d = 0.2 \u00d7 1500\n\n30d = 300\n\nNow, divide both sides by 30:\n\nd = 300 / 30\n\nd = 10 days\n\nAgain, I get 10 days. It seems consistent across different methods, so I can be confident that the answer is 10 days.\n\nLet me just verify if there's another way to look at it. Suppose I calculate the productivity in widgets per day per worker, and then scale it up.\n\nFrom the first scenario:\n\n20 workers produce 1000 widgets in 10 days.\n\nSo, daily production is 1000 widgets / 10 days = 100 widgets per day.\n\nTherefore, per worker production is 100 widgets per day / 20 workers = 5 widgets per worker per day.\n\nNow, with 30 workers, production would be 30 workers \u00d7 5 widgets per worker per day = 150 widgets per day.\n\nTo produce 1500 widgets at 150 widgets per day, it would take 1500 / 150 = 10 days.\n\nSame answer again. It seems no matter which approach I take, I end up with 10 days.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to approach this problem, and all methods confirm that it would take 30 workers 10 days to produce 1500 widgets, assuming they work at the same rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
