        "content": "So if someone drinks 3.5 liters of water every day, and we want to know how much they drink in a month that has 30 days, we can figure that out pretty easily.\n\nFirst, we need to multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month. So that's 3.5 liters per day times 30 days.\n\nLet me do the math here. 3.5 liters times 30 is... well, 3 liters times 30 would be 90 liters, and 0.5 liters times 30 is 15 liters. So adding those together, 90 plus 15 equals 105 liters.\n\nSo, that person would drink 105 liters of water in a 30-day month.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to look at it. What if the month has more or fewer days? For example, some months have 31 days, others have 28 or 29 in February. But since the question specifies a 30-day month, we can stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, if someone wants to know for an average month, they might consider that an average month has about 30.44 days (since 365 days divided by 12 months is about 30.44). But again, the question is specifically about a 30-day month.\n\nLet me double-check my multiplication to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 3.5 times 30:\n\n3.5\n\ntimes 30\n\n------\n\nFirst, 5 times 0 is 0.\n\n5 times 3 is 15, plus the carried over 1 is 16.\n\nSo, 105 liters.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 3.5 liters per day is the same as 7/2 liters per day. So, 7/2 liters per day times 30 days would be (7/2) * 30 = (7 * 30)/2 = 210/2 = 105 liters.\n\nSame answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the total comes out to be 105 liters for a 30-day month.\n\nNow, if someone drinks 3.5 liters daily, that's quite a bit more than the general recommendation. Typically, health guidelines suggest around 2 liters (or half a gallon) per day for average adults, but this can vary based on factors like climate, activity level, and individual needs.\n\nDrinking 3.5 liters a day might be necessary for someone who is very physically active, lives in a hot climate, or has higher fluid needs. However, it's important not to overhydrate, as that can lead to health issues like hyponatremia, where the balance of electrolytes in the body becomes disrupted.\n\nBut in this case, since the question is just about calculating the total consumption, we can conclude that it's 105 liters in a 30-day month.\n\nLet me see if there's another angle to this. Maybe considering the cost or the environmental impact of drinking that much water.\n\nFor example, if someone is buying bottled water, 105 liters would be quite a few bottles, which could add up in terms of cost and plastic waste.\n\nAlternatively, if they're drinking tap water, there might be considerations related to water bills or water quality.\n\nBut again, the question is specifically about the quantity consumed, so maybe it's best to stick with that.\n\nIn summary, drinking 3.5 liters of water per day amounts to 105 liters in a 30-day month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
