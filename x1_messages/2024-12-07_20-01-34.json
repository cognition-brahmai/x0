        "content": "So I have this problem here: \"In how many ways can a committee of 4 people be formed from a group of 9 people if one specific person must be on the committee?\" Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that forming committees is basically about combinations, right? Because the order in which we select the people doesn't matter; it's just about who gets selected. So, combinations are the way to go here.\n\nNow, the total number of people is 9, and we need to form a committee of 4. But there's a twist: one specific person must be on the committee. Let's call this person Person A for simplicity.\n\nSo, since Person A has to be on the committee, that means we already have one spot taken. That leaves us with 3 spots to fill on the committee.\n\nSince Person A is already chosen, we only need to select the remaining 3 people from the remaining 8 people (because Person A is already taken out of the pool).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: how many ways can we choose 3 people from 8?\n\nI recall that the formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\).\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8 - 3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3! \\cdot 5!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 8! \\), \\( 3! \\), and \\( 5! \\).\n\n\\( 8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40320 \\)\n\n\\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n\n\\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\)\n\nSo, plugging back in:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 3) = \\frac{40320}{6 \\times 120} = \\frac{40320}{720} = 56\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 56 ways to choose the remaining 3 people from the 8 available.\n\nBut wait, since Person A is already on the committee, the total number of ways to form the committee is just these 56 ways.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as first selecting Person A, which is a given, and then choosing 3 more people from the remaining 8.\n\nSo, yes, that makes sense.\n\nIs there another way to approach this to confirm the answer?\n\nWell, another way is to consider the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that do not include Person A.\n\nFirst, the total number of committees without any restrictions is \\( C(9, 4) \\).\n\nUsing the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(9, 4) = \\frac{9!}{4!(9 - 4)!} = \\frac{9!}{4! \\cdot 5!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating factorials:\n\n\\( 9! = 362880 \\)\n\n\\( 4! = 24 \\)\n\n\\( 5! = 120 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(9, 4) = \\frac{362880}{24 \\times 120} = \\frac{362880}{2880} = 126\n\\]\n\nNow, the number of committees that do not include Person A is \\( C(8, 4) \\), since we're choosing all 4 members from the remaining 8 people.\n\n\\[\nC(8, 4) = \\frac{8!}{4!(8 - 4)!} = \\frac{40320}{24 \\times 24} = \\frac{40320}{576} = 70\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of committees that include Person A is the total number of committees minus the number that exclude Person A:\n\n\\[\n126 - 70 = 56\n\\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 56 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as selecting Person A first (which is mandatory), and then selecting the remaining 3 members from the 8 others.\n\nThis is equivalent to \\( 1 \\times C(8, 3) = 1 \\times 56 = 56 \\), which again confirms the answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem?\n\nWell, perhaps using permutations, but since the order doesn't matter, combinations are the way to go.\n\nWait, actually, if order mattered, it would be permutations, but in this case, it's purely about combinations.\n\nAnother way is to think in terms of binary choices, but that might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\nFor example, each person is either on the committee or not, but with the restriction that Person A must be on the committee.\n\nSo, for the remaining 8 people, each can be either on or off the committee, but we need exactly 3 more members.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 people from 8 is again \\( C(8, 3) = 56 \\), which confirms the answer once more.\n\nAlright, I think I've approached this problem from multiple angles and consistently gotten 56 as the answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 56.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]"
