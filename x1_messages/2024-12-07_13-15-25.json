        "content": "The film you're referring to is \"Forrest Gump,\" directed by Robert Zemeckis. It was released in 1994 and stars Tom Hanks in the titular role. The movie tells the story of Forrest Gump, a kind-hearted man with a low IQ who finds himself involved in some of the most significant historical events in the United States throughout the second half of the 20th century. These events include the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Watergate scandal, among others. Hanks's performance in the film earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\n\"Forrest Gump\" is renowned for its blend of humor, emotion, and historical accuracy, as it portrays these real-life events through Forrest's innocent and unique perspective. The film also became famous for its use of visual effects to insert Forrest into archival footage of the historical events, seamlessly integrating him with real figures from history.\n\nThe movie was adapted from a novel of the same name by Winston Groom, but the film version, written by Eric Roth, diverges significantly from the book in terms of character development and plot details. Despite some criticisms regarding historical accuracy and the portrayal of certain characters, \"Forrest Gump\" was widely acclaimed for its storytelling, performances, and technical achievements.\n\nIt was a massive commercial success, grossing over $677 million worldwide on a budget of approximately $55 million, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1994. Additionally, it received multiple Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Zemeckis, and Best Actor for Hanks.\n\nThe film has since become a cultural phenomenon, with its catchphrases like \"life is like a box of chocolates\" and \"run, Forrest, run\" entering popular lexicon. It continues to be celebrated for its heartwarming narrative and Hanks's iconic performance.\n\n## Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Forrest Gump}} \\]"
