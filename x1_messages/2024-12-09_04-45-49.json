        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, and each one has a 5% chance of being defective. They test each one and throw away the defective ones. We need to find out, on average, how many good widgets they have left each day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"5% chance of being defective\" means. Does that mean that out of every 100 widgets, 5 are defective? Yeah, that sounds right. So, for 1000 widgets, how many would be defective on average?\n\nIf 5 out of every 100 are defective, then for 1000, I can calculate it by setting up a proportion. 1000 is 10 times 100, so the number of defective widgets would be 5 times 10, which is 50. So, on average, 50 widgets are defective each day.\n\nNow, if they start with 1000 and discard the 50 defective ones, how many are left? That would be 1000 minus 50, which is 950. So, on average, they produce 950 non-defective widgets daily.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way to calculate this using probabilities? I think there is. If each widget has a 5% chance of being defective, then it has a 95% chance of being non-defective, right? Because 100% minus 5% is 95%.\n\nSo, if each widget has a 95% chance of being good, and they make 1000 widgets, then the expected number of good widgets is 1000 times 0.95. Let me calculate that: 1000 times 0.95 is 950. So, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using binomial distribution? Because each widget can be defective or not, which is a binary outcome, and the probability is the same for each one.\n\nIn binomial distribution, the expected value is n times p, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success. Here, \"success\" would be a non-defective widget, which is what we're interested in.\n\nSo, n is 1000, and p is 0.95, so expected number of non-defective widgets is 1000 times 0.95, which again is 950.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let's think about it another way. Suppose we have 1000 widgets, each with a 5% defect rate independently.\n\nThe expected number of defective widgets is 1000 times 0.05, which is 50. So, expected number of good ones is 1000 minus 50, which is 950. Again, the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to say that, on average, the factory produces 950 non-defective widgets daily.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"on average.\" That makes sense because sometimes there might be more defective widgets, sometimes fewer, but on average, it's 950.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider here? Like, does the testing process affect the number of defective widgets? The question says they test each widget and discard the defective ones. Assuming the testing is perfect and correctly identifies all defective widgets, then yes, they discard all defective ones, and only the good ones remain.\n\nIf the testing wasn't perfect, and sometimes good widgets are mistakenly discarded or defective ones are passed through, that would complicate things. But the question doesn't mention any issues with the testing process, so we can assume it's accurate.\n\nAlso, the production rate is constant at 1000 widgets per day, and the defect rate is constant at 5%, so there don't seem to be any variables changing over time in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 950 non-defective widgets produced daily on average.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{950} \\]"
