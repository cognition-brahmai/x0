        "content": "Yes, white bread is generally less nutritious than whole grain bread. Whole grain bread retains the entire grain, including the bran, germ, and endosperm, which provides more fiber, vitamins, and minerals. White bread, on the other hand, is made from refined flour, which removes the bran and germ, stripping away much of the fiber and nutrients. Therefore, whole grain bread is a healthier choice as it offers more nutritional benefits."
