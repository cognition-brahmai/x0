        "content": "So there are 20 people in the room, and half of them are wearing glasses. That means 10 people are wearing glasses, right? Now, two people are wearing contact lenses. Does that mean they are not wearing glasses? I think so, because contact lenses and glasses are different. So, if 10 people are wearing glasses and 2 are wearing contact lenses, then the number of people not wearing glasses would be the total people minus those wearing glasses. But wait, what about the contact lens wearers? Are they considered to be not wearing glasses? I think yes, because they are wearing contact lenses instead of glasses.\n\nSo, total people are 20. People wearing glasses are 10. People wearing contact lenses are 2, and I assume they are not wearing glasses. So, the number of people not wearing glasses would be the total people minus those wearing glasses, which is 20 - 10 = 10. But, since the 2 wearing contact lenses are also not wearing glasses, they should be included in those not wearing glasses. Wait, but they are already included in the 10 who are not wearing glasses.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. If half are wearing glasses, that's 10 people. The other half, which is also 10 people, are not wearing glasses. Out of these 10 who are not wearing glasses, 2 are wearing contact lenses. So, the number of people not wearing glasses is still 10, including those with contact lenses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to say that out of the 20 people, half are wearing glasses, and additionally, two are wearing contact lenses. If that's the case, then the number wearing glasses is 10, and the number wearing contact lenses is 2, so the total wearing some kind of vision correction is 12, and those not wearing any vision correction are 20 - 12 = 8.\n\nBut, I think the first interpretation makes more sense, because usually, contact lenses are an alternative to glasses, so people wearing contact lenses wouldn't be wearing glasses as well. So, in that case, the number of people not wearing glasses would be 10, including those wearing contact lenses.\n\nWait, but the question says \"how many people are not wearing glasses if two people are wearing contact lenses.\" The \"if\" suggests a condition, meaning that out of the 20 people, half are wearing glasses, and among those not wearing glasses, 2 are wearing contact lenses.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nTotal people: 20\n\nWearing glasses: 10\n\nNot wearing glasses: 20 - 10 = 10\n\nOut of those not wearing glasses, 2 are wearing contact lenses.\n\nTherefore, the number of people not wearing glasses is 10, which includes those wearing contact lenses.\n\nSo, the answer should be 10 people are not wearing glasses.\n\nBut, to make sure, maybe I should consider that the two wearing contact lenses are part of the half not wearing glasses. So, if half are wearing glasses (10 people), the other half are not (10 people), and among those 10, 2 are wearing contact lenses.\n\nTherefore, the number of people not wearing glasses is 10.\n\nYeah, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
