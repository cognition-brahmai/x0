The expression given is:\n\n4 * (6 - 2) / 2 + 8^2 - 9\n\nFirst, I need to remember the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n6 - 2 = 4\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n4 * 4 / 2 + 8^2 - 9\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n8^2 = 64\n\nSo now it's:\n\n4 * 4 / 2 + 64 - 9\n\nNow, multiplication and division from left to right:\n\nFirst, 4 * 4 = 16\n\nThen, 16 / 2 = 8\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n8 + 64 - 9\n\nFinally, addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n8 + 64 = 72\n\n72 - 9 = 63\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 63.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{63} \\]"
