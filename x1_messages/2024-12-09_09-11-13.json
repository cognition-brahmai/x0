        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a train traveling from Station A to Station B. The distance between the two stations is 120 miles, and it takes the train 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete the journey. I need to find its average speed.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for average speed. I think it's the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, average speed equals distance divided by time.\n\nOkay, so distance is 120 miles. Time is 1 hour and 30 minutes. I need to make sure that the units for time and distance are compatible. In this case, since the speed is likely to be in miles per hour, I should convert the time into hours.\n\n1 hour and 30 minutes is the same as 1.5 hours. Because 30 minutes is half an hour, so 1 + 0.5 equals 1.5 hours.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula: average speed = 120 miles / 1.5 hours.\n\nLet me do the division. 120 divided by 1.5.\n\nWell, dividing by 1.5 is the same as multiplying by 2/3, I think. Wait, no. Actually, 1.5 is 3/2, so dividing by 3/2 is the same as multiplying by 2/3.\n\nSo, 120 * (2/3) = ?\n\nFirst, 120 divided by 3 is 40, and then multiplied by 2 is 80.\n\nSo, the average speed is 80 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf the train travels 120 miles in 1.5 hours at a constant speed, then yes, 120 divided by 1.5 should give me the speed in miles per hour.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in minutes. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1.5 hours is 90 minutes.\n\n120 miles in 90 minutes.\n\nTo find the speed in miles per hour, I can set up a proportion.\n\nIf 90 minutes corresponds to 120 miles, then 60 minutes corresponds to x miles.\n\nSo, x = (120 miles * 60 minutes) / 90 minutes.\n\nLet's calculate that: (120 * 60) / 90 = 7200 / 90 = 80 miles per hour.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert everything to seconds, but that seems more complicated. Minutes and hours are fine for this problem.\n\nSo, the train's average speed is 80 miles per hour.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
