        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many students participate in sports activities. The school has 800 students, and 60% of them participate in sports. So, we calculate 60% of 800:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students participating in sports} = 0.60 \\times 800 = 480 \\]\n\nNow, out of these 480 students who participate in sports, 40% are girls. That means the remaining 60% are boys because the total must add up to 100%. So, to find out how many boys participate in sports, we can calculate 60% of 480:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of boys participating in sports} = 0.60 \\times 480 = 288 \\]\n\nAlternatively, we could first find out how many girls participate in sports and then subtract that number from the total number of students participating in sports to get the number of boys. Let's try that as a check.\n\nFirst, find the number of girls participating in sports:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls participating in sports} = 0.40 \\times 480 = 192 \\]\n\nThen, subtract that from the total number of students participating in sports:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of boys participating in sports} = 480 - 192 = 288 \\]\n\nBoth methods give us the same answer, which is a good sign that we've calculated it correctly.\n\nSo, the number of boys participating in sports activities is 288.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]"
