The break-even point can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Break-even point (units)} = \\frac{\\text{Fixed Costs}}{\\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \\text{Variable Cost per Unit}}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Selling Price per Unit = $50\n- Variable Cost per Unit = $30\n- Fixed Costs = $10,000\n\nFirst, we calculate the contribution margin per unit, which is the difference between the selling price and the variable cost per unit:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Contribution Margin per Unit} = \\$50 - \\$30 = \\$20\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the contribution margin per unit to find out how many units need to be sold to cover the fixed costs:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Break-even point (units)} = \\frac{\\$10,000}{\\$20} = 500 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the company must sell 500 units to break even.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nTo verify, we can calculate the total revenue and total costs at 500 units.\n\n- Total Revenue = 500 units * \\$50/unit = \\$25,000\n- Total Variable Costs = 500 units * \\$30/unit = \\$15,000\n- Total Costs = Fixed Costs + Total Variable Costs = \\$10,000 + \\$15,000 = \\$25,000\n\nSince Total Revenue equals Total Costs at 500 units, the break-even point is confirmed to be 500 units."
