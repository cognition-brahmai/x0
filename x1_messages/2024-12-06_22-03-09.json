        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, initially, there are 10 employees, each working 40 hours per week. That means the total number of hours worked by all employees before any changes is 10 employees * 40 hours/employee = 400 hours per week.\n\nNow, the company decides to hire 5 more employees, bringing the total number of employees to 10 + 5 = 15 employees.\n\nAt the same time, they're reducing everyone's workweek to 35 hours. So, each of the 15 employees will now be working 35 hours per week.\n\nTo find the new total number of hours worked by all employees combined, we multiply the number of employees by the new number of hours each works: 15 employees * 35 hours/employee.\n\nLet's do that multiplication: 15 * 35.\n\nI can calculate this as 15 * 30 = 450, and 15 * 5 = 75, then add those together: 450 + 75 = 525.\n\nSo, after hiring 5 more employees and reducing the workweek to 35 hours, the total number of hours worked by all employees combined is 525 hours per week.\n\nWait a minute, that seems higher than before. Initially, with 10 employees at 40 hours each, it was 400 hours per week. Now, with 15 employees at 35 hours each, it's 525 hours per week. That's interesting; even though they reduced the hours per employee, the total hours increased because they hired more people.\n\nIs there another way to look at this to confirm? Maybe compare the percentage change in the number of employees and the hours worked.\n\nOriginally, 10 employees at 40 hours: 400 hours total.\n\nAfter, 15 employees at 35 hours: 525 hours total.\n\nThe increase in total hours is 525 - 400 = 125 hours.\n\nSo, the total hours have increased by 125 hours per week.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the change in hours per employee and the change in the number of employees.\n\nEach of the original 10 employees now works 35 hours instead of 40, so each works 40 - 35 = 5 hours less.\n\nSo, the total reduction for the original 10 employees is 10 * 5 = 50 hours.\n\nThen, 5 new employees are hired, each working 35 hours, adding 5 * 35 = 175 hours.\n\nSo, the net change is -50 hours (from the original employees working fewer hours) plus +175 hours (from the new employees) = +125 hours, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours worked by all employees combined is indeed 525 hours per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{525} \\]"
