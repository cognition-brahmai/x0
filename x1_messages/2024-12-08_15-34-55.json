        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges $50 per day and $0.20 per mile. The customer rents the car for 5 days and drives it for 300 miles. So, I need to calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for the days rented. That's $50 per day for 5 days. So, 50 times 5 is 250 dollars.\n\nNext, the cost for the miles driven. That's $0.20 per mile for 300 miles. So, 0.20 times 300 is 60 dollars.\n\nNow, I'll add both amounts together to get the total cost. 250 plus 60 equals 310 dollars.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other fee or tax that might apply? The problem doesn't mention anything else, so I'll assume that's the total cost.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations.\n\nDays rented: 5 days at $50 per day: 5 * 50 = 250.\n\nMiles driven: 300 miles at $0.20 per mile: 300 * 0.20 = 60.\n\nTotal cost: 250 + 60 = 310.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{310} \\]"
