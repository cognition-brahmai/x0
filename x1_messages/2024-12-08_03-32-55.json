        "content": "Let's see. There's a bag with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, and I need to find the probability of drawing a red ball. Okay, probability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, first, what's the total number of balls in the bag? There are 4 red and 6 blue, so total balls are 4 + 6 = 10 balls.\n\nNow, the favorable outcome is drawing a red ball. There are 4 red balls, so the number of favorable outcomes is 4.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5 or 0.4, which is 40%.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe considering the blue balls. The probability of drawing a blue ball would be 6/10, which is 3/5 or 0.6, which is 60%. So, the probability of drawing a red ball should be 1 minus the probability of drawing a blue ball, which is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4, or 40%. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other approach I can take to confirm this? Perhaps using combinations. The number of ways to choose 1 red ball out of 4 is C(4,1), and the total number of ways to choose any 1 ball out of 10 is C(10,1). So, probability = C(4,1)/C(10,1) = 4/10 = 0.4. Again, the same answer.\n\nHmm, what if someone argues that the balls are not equally likely to be drawn? But the problem doesn't specify any bias, so I think it's safe to assume that each ball has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\nAnother thought: if there were more red balls, the probability would increase, and if there were more blue balls, it would decrease. In this case, with 4 red and 6 blue, it makes sense that it's less likely to draw a red ball than a blue one.\n\nLet me consider if there's any trick here, like replacement or multiple draws, but the question is simply about drawing one ball. So, no tricks there.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways, and all methods point to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the probability is 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.4} \\]\n"
