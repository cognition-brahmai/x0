        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have the word \"EXAMPLE\" and we need to find out how many different ways we can arrange its letters. First off, I know that arranging letters is about permutations, but since there are repeating letters, I need to be careful.\n\nThe word \"EXAMPLE\" has 7 letters: E, X, A, M, P, L, E. I notice that the letter E appears twice, and the other letters are unique. For arrangements of letters where some are repeated, the formula for the number of distinct permutations is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n_k!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of letters,\n\n- \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k \\) are the frequencies of the repeating letters.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 7 \\), and since E repeats twice, \\( n_1 = 2 \\). All other letters appear once, so their factorials are 1, which don't affect the denominator.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7!}{2!} = \\frac{5040}{2} = 2520\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that. I recall that for permutations of multiset, this is the correct formula. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as arranging 7 distinct letters, but since two E's are identical, we divide by the number of ways to arrange those E's, which is 2!.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the total number of distinct arrangements should be 2520.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I treat all 7 letters as unique, which they would be if the E's were distinct, say E1 and E2. Then, the total arrangements would be 7!, which is 5040.\n\nHowever, since the two E's are actually identical, every pair of arrangements where E1 and E2 are swapped would be considered the same. Therefore, I need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the E's among themselves, which is 2!.\n\nSo, again, 5040 divided by 2 equals 2520.\n\nAlternatively, if there were more repeating letters, I would divide by the factorial of each set of repeating letters. For example, if there were three E's and two A's, it would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7!}{3! \\cdot 2!}\n\\]\n\nBut in this case, it's just two E's.\n\nLet me also consider if there are any other letters that are repeating. Looking back at \"EXAMPLE\", letters E, X, A, M, P, L, E, yes, only E repeats twice.\n\nWait, but in the word \"EXAMPLE\", there are two E's, but are there any other letters that repeat? Let's list them out: E, X, A, M, P, L, E. No, only E repeats.\n\nJust to be safe, I can list out the unique letters and their frequencies:\n\n- E: 2\n\n- X: 1\n\n- A: 1\n\n- M: 1\n\n- P: 1\n\n- L: 1\n\nSo, only E repeats.\n\nTherefore, the formula remains:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7!}{2!} = 2520\n\\]\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if all letters were unique, it would be 7! = 5040. But since E repeats twice, we divide by 2!, which gives 2520.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to fix one E in a position and arrange the remaining 6 letters, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, no. If I fix one E in a position, then I have 6 remaining letters, including one E, which is unique now. So, that would be 6! arrangements, which is 720. But since I can choose which E to fix in the first place, I have to consider both E's, but that would double count.\n\nNo, that approach is more complicated and prone to error.\n\nI think the initial approach is the best: total arrangements divided by the factorial of the number of repeats.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in \"EXAMPLE\" is 2520.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I can calculate it differently.\n\nLet's see, another way is to choose positions for the E's first and then arrange the remaining letters.\n\nThere are 7 positions, and I need to choose 2 for the E's. The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 7 for the E's is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7!}{2! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\nThen, for the remaining 5 positions, I have the letters X, A, M, P, L, which are all unique. The number of ways to arrange these 5 letters is 5! = 120.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2} \\times 5! = 21 \\times 120 = 2520\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 2520.\n\nThis confirms that the initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the two E's as distinct, say E1 and E2, then the total arrangements would be 7! = 5040. But since E1 and E2 are identical, each pair of arrangements where E1 and E2 are swapped is actually the same arrangement. Therefore, I need to divide by 2! to account for this repetition.\n\nSo, once again, 5040 divided by 2 equals 2520.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, and I'm confident that the answer is 2520.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2520} \\]"
