This sounds like a specific achievement in mountaineering history, so I should be able to find this information through a web search.\n\nFirst, I'll use the DuckDuckGo search engine to look for information about the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen. I'll phrase my search query carefully to get the most accurate results.\n\nPlan: Search for the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen.\n\n#Info1 = DuckDuckGo[\"first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results, I need to look through the top pages to find reliable sources that can confirm the climber's name. I should look for sources like news articles, official mountaineering websites, or reputable encyclopedias.\n\nPlan: Extract relevant URLs from the search results.\n\n#Info2 = URLExtractor[#Info1]\n\nWith the list of URLs, I'll need to visit these websites to gather the necessary information. I can use the SiteScraper tool to extract the text content from these pages.\n\nPlan: Scrape the text content from the extracted URLs.\n\n#Info3 = SiteScraper[#Info2]\n\nNow, I have the text content from the relevant websites. I need to find the specific information about who was the first to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen.

I might want to cross-verify this information with another search to ensure accuracy.\n\nPlan: Cross-verify the information by searching for the person's achievement.\n\n#Info5 = DuckDuckGo[#Info4 + \" climbed Mount Everest without oxygen\"]\n\nPlan: Extract relevant URLs from the second search.\n\n#Info6 = URLExtractor[#Info5]\n\nPlan: Scrape the text content from these new URLs.\n\n#Info7 = SiteScraper[#Info6]\n\nPlan: Use NLPQA to confirm the achievement.\n\n#Info8 = NLPQA[\"Did \" + #Info4 + \" really climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen?\", context: #Info7]\n\nNow, based on #Info8, I can confirm whether the information is accurate.\n\nFinal Answer: #Info4, confirmed by #Info8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n[The name of the first person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, as determined by the above plan.]"
