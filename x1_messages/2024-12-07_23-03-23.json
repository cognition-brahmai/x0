        "content": "Sure! Implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Go is a great way to understand both the algorithm and the language. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph, which can be adapted to find the shortest path to a specific target node.\n\nBefore we dive into the code, let's briefly understand how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Assign a tentative distance value to every node: set it to zero for the initial node and infinity for all other nodes.\n   - Set the initial node as the current node.\n\n2. **Processing**:\n   - For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node.\n   - If a new calculated tentative distance to a neighbor is less than the previously recorded tentative distance, update the tentative distance.\n   - When all neighbors of the current node have been considered, mark the current node as visited.\n   - Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current node.\n   - Repeat the process until the target node is marked as visited or there are no unvisited nodes left.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Once the algorithm completes, the shortest path to the target can be reconstructed by backtracking from the target node to the start node using the recorded previous nodes.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Go.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Go, we'll use a priority queue to efficiently retrieve the node with the smallest distance. We'll represent the graph using an adjacency list.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Graph Representation**:\n   - Use a map where keys are nodes and values are slices of edges connected to that node.\n   - Each edge is represented as a struct containing the target node and the weight of the edge.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**:\n   - Implement a priority queue to manage nodes based on their current shortest distance from the start node.\n\n3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize distances to all nodes as infinite except the start node, which is 0.\n   - Use a priority queue to keep track of nodes to visit, starting with the start node.\n   - While the queue is not empty, process the node with the smallest distance, update distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Keep a map to record the previous node for each node to reconstruct the path once the target node is reached.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math\"\n\t\"container/heap\"\n)\n\n// Node represents a node in the graph.\ntype Node string\n\n// Edge represents an edge from one node to another with a weight.\ntype Edge struct {\n To     Node\n Weight int\n}\n\n// Graph represents the graph using an adjacency list.\ntype Graph map[Node][]Edge\n\n// Implementing a priority queue.\ntype PriorityQueue []*Item\n\ntype Item struct {\n node  Node\n distance int\n index int\n}\n\nfunc (pq PriorityQueue) Len() int { return len(pq) }\n\nfunc (pq PriorityQueue) Less(i, j int) bool {\n return pq[i].distance < pq[j].distance\n}\n\nfunc (pq PriorityQueue) Swap(i, j int) {\n pq[i], pq[j] = pq[j], pq[i]\n pq[i].index = i\n pq[j].index = j\n}\n\nfunc (pq *PriorityQueue) Push(x interface{}) {\n n := len(*pq)\n item := x.(*Item)\n item.index = n\n *pq = append(*pq, item)\n}\n\nfunc (pq *PriorityQueue) Pop() interface{} {\n old := *pq\n n := len(old)\n item := old[n-1]\n old[n-1] = nil  // avoid memory leak\n item.index = -1 // for safety\n *pq = old[0 : n-1]\n return item\n}\n\n// Dijkstra finds the shortest path from start to end in the graph.\nfunc Dijkstra(graph Graph, start, end Node) ([]Node, int) {\n distances := make(map[Node]int)\n previous := make(map[Node]Node)\n pq := make(PriorityQueue, 0)\n\n for node := range graph {\n distances[node] = math.MaxInt32\n }\n distances[start] = 0\n\n heap.Init(&pq)\n heap.Push(&pq, &Item{\n node: start,\n distance: 0,\n })\n\n for pq.Len() > 0 {\n item := heap.Pop(&pq).(*Item)\n u := item.node\n\n if u == end {\n break\n }\n\n if item.distance > distances[u] {\n continue // This is an outdated pop.
