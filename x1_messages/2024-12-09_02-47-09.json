        "content": "So you've got this rectangular garden that's currently 20 meters long and 12 meters wide, and you want to increase its area by 50% without changing its shape. That means you need to keep the same length-to-width ratio, right? So, first, let's figure out the current area of the garden.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, with a length of 20 meters and a width of 12 meters, the current area is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Area} = 20 \\, \\text{m} \\times 12 \\, \\text{m} = 240 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nNow, you want to increase this area by 50%. To find out what 50% of the current area is, you can calculate:\n\n\\[ 50\\% \\, \\text{of} \\, 240 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 0.5 \\times 240 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 120 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nSo, the new area should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Area} = \\text{Current Area} + 50\\% \\, \\text{increase} = 240 \\, \\text{m}^2 + 120 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 360 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nBut here's the catch: you don't want to change the shape of the garden, which means the ratio of length to width should remain the same. The original ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Length}}{\\text{Width}} = \\frac{20}{12} = \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nSo, whatever the new dimensions are, they should maintain this 5:3 ratio.\n\nLet's denote the new length as \\( L \\) and the new width as \\( W \\). We have two conditions:\n\n1. The new area should be 360 m\u00b2:\n\n\\[ L \\times W = 360 \\]\n\n2. The ratio of length to width should remain 5:3:\n\n\\[ \\frac{L}{W} = \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express \\( L \\) in terms of \\( W \\):\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{5}{3} W \\]\n\nNow, plug this expression for \\( L \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{5}{3} W \\right) \\times W = 360 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{3} W^2 = 360 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( W^2 \\), multiply both sides by 3/5:\n\n\\[ W^2 = 360 \\times \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ W^2 = 216 \\]\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find \\( W \\):\n\n\\[ W = \\sqrt{216} \\]\n\n\\[ W = \\sqrt{36 \\times 6} \\]\n\n\\[ W = 6\\sqrt{6} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for \\( L \\):\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 6\\sqrt{6} \\]\n\n\\[ L = 10\\sqrt{6} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nSo, the new dimensions should be \\( 10\\sqrt{6} \\) meters in length and \\( 6\\sqrt{6} \\) meters in width.\n\nBut, to make sure this is correct, let's check the area:\n\n\\[ L \\times W = 10\\sqrt{6} \\times 6\\sqrt{6} = 60 \\times 6 = 360 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the desired new area.\n\nAlternatively, since the area is increasing by 50%, which is a multiplication by 1.5, and we're keeping the shape the same, we could think in terms of scaling both dimensions by the same factor. Let's denote the scaling factor as \\( k \\). Then:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Length} = k \\times \\text{Original Length} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{New Width} = k \\times \\text{Original Width} \\]\n\nAnd the new area would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Area} = (k \\times 20) \\times (k \\times 12) = k^2 \\times 240 \\]\n\nWe want the new area to be 360 m\u00b2, so:\n\n\\[ k^2 \\times 240 = 360 \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = \\frac{360}{240} = 1.5 \\]\n\n\\[ k = \\sqrt{1.5} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Length} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\times 20 = 10\\sqrt{6} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{New Width} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\times 12 = 6\\sqrt{6} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nWhich matches what we found earlier.\n\nSo, the new dimensions should be \\( 10\\sqrt{6} \\) meters in length and \\( 6\\sqrt{6} \\) meters in width.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe new dimensions should be \\boxed{10\\sqrt{6} \\text{ meters in length and } 6\\sqrt{6} \\text{ meters in width}}"
