        "content": "In mathematics, the term that refers to the result of multiplying a number by itself three times is called the \"cube\" of that number. For example, if you have the number 2, multiplying it by itself three times would be 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, which equals 8. So, 8 is the cube of 2. This concept is similar to calculating the volume of a cube, where all sides are of equal length."
