        "content": "The Sargasso Sea is located within the Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded by four currents: the Gulf Stream to the west, the North Atlantic Current to the north, the Canary Current to the east, and the North Atlantic Equatorial Current to the south. This creates a large, mostly still area in the middle of the ocean, which is defined by these surrounding currents rather than by land boundaries. The Sargasso Sea is known for its distinctive brown Sargassum seaweed, which floats on the surface and provides a habitat for various marine organisms."
