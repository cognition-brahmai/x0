        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here. One leaves Station A at 9 AM going at 60 mph, and another leaves Station B at 11 AM going towards Station A at 80 mph. Station B is 300 miles away from Station A. I need to find out when they meet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how far the first train has traveled by the time the second train starts at 11 AM. The first train leaves at 9 AM and travels at 60 mph, so by 11 AM, which is 2 hours later, it would have traveled:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nSo, by 11 AM, the first train is 120 miles away from Station A, moving towards Station B.\n\nNow, the second train leaves Station B at 11 AM, going towards Station A at 80 mph. The initial distance between the two trains at 11 AM is the original distance minus the distance the first train has already covered.\n\nInitial distance at 11 AM:\n\nTotal distance between A and B is 300 miles.\n\nFirst train has covered 120 miles by 11 AM.\n\nSo, remaining distance between the two trains at 11 AM is:\n\n300 miles - 120 miles = 180 miles\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other. So, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nRelative speed = 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph\n\nNow, time taken to cover the remaining 180 miles at a relative speed of 140 mph is:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nTime = 180 miles / 140 mph = 1.2857 hours\n\nConvert 1.2857 hours into hours and minutes.\n\n0.2857 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour \u2248 17.1429 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 1 hour and 17 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet at:\n\n11 AM + 1 hour 17 minutes = 12:17 PM\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up equations based on the time each train has been traveling.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time after 11 AM as t hours.\n\nSo, the first train has been traveling for t + 2 hours (since it left at 9 AM).\n\nDistance covered by the first train: 60 \u00d7 (t + 2)\n\nThe second train has been traveling for t hours.\n\nDistance covered by the second train: 80 \u00d7 t\n\nThe sum of these distances should equal the initial 300 miles.\n\nSo:\n\n60(t + 2) + 80t = 300\n\nLet\u2019s solve for t:\n\n60t + 120 + 80t = 300\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140t + 120 = 300\n\nSubtract 120 from both sides:\n\n140t = 180\n\nDivide both sides by 140:\n\nt = 180 / 140 = 1.2857 hours\n\nWhich is the same as before: 1 hour and approximately 17 minutes.\n\nSo, the meeting time is indeed 11 AM + 1 hour 17 minutes, which is 12:17 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12:17 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
