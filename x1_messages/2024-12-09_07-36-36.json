        "content": "Sure! Here's a Python function that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing two integers as arguments, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = gcd(48, 18)\nprint(result)  # Output: 6\n```\n\nThis function works by repeatedly applying the Euclidean algorithm, which states that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm continues to find the GCD of the smaller number and the remainder until the remainder is zero, at which point the GCD is the last non-zero remainder."
