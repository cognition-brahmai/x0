        "content": "So the factory makes 500 widgets every day, and each one has a 5% chance of being defective. I need to find out, on average, how many of those widgets are not defective.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"5% chance of being defective\" means. If each widget has a 5% chance of being defective, that means for each widget, there's a 5% probability it's defective and a 95% probability it's not defective.\n\nSo, for each widget, the probability of being non-defective is 95%, or 0.95.\n\nNow, since the factory produces 500 widgets per day, I can calculate the average number of non-defective widgets by multiplying the total number of widgets by the probability of a widget being non-defective.\n\nSo, average non-defective widgets = total widgets * probability of being non-defective\n\nThat would be 500 * 0.95.\n\nLet me do the math: 500 * 0.95 = 475.\n\nSo, on average, the factory produces 475 non-defective widgets each day.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should think about it another way. If there's a 5% defect rate, then out of 100 widgets, 5 would be defective and 95 would be non-defective. So, for 500 widgets, it's 5 times that, which is 25 defective and 475 non-defective. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the average number of defective widgets first and then subtract that from the total number of widgets.\n\nSo, average defective widgets = total widgets * probability of being defective = 500 * 0.05 = 25.\n\nThen, non-defective widgets = total widgets - defective widgets = 500 - 25 = 475.\n\nAgain, that's the same answer.\n\nI think that makes sense. The factory produces 500 widgets, 5% of them are defective on average, so 25 widgets are defective, and therefore 475 are non-defective.\n\nBut wait, is there a more precise way to calculate this, maybe using binomial distribution or something like that?\n\nWell, since each widget can be either defective or non-defective, this is a binomial distribution problem, where each widget is a trial with two outcomes.\n\nThe binomial distribution formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (widgets),\n\n- k is the number of successes (non-defective widgets),\n\n- p is the probability of success (0.95),\n\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nBut calculating the exact number using binomial distribution might be overkill for finding the average number of non-defective widgets.\n\nIn binomial distribution, the expected value (average) is given by:\n\nE(X) = n * p\n\nSo, E(X) = 500 * 0.95 = 475, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer remains the same: on average, the factory produces 475 non-defective widgets each day.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the defect rate is independent for each widget.\n\nAssuming that the defectiveness of one widget doesn't affect another, which is a reasonable assumption, then the binomial model is appropriate.\n\nIf there were some dependency between widgets, perhaps due to shared production factors, then the distribution might be different, but without that information, I'll stick with the binomial model.\n\nAlso, since n is large (500) and p is not too close to 0 or 1, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution, but again, for finding the average, that's not necessary.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory produces, on average, 475 non-defective widgets per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{475} \\]"
