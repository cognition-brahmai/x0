        "content": "So there's this problem about 100 light bulbs in a row, all starting off. You walk by them 100 times, and each time you flip the switch of bulbs at certain intervals. The first time, you turn on every single bulb. The second time, you flip every second bulb, so you're turning some off. The third time, every third bulb, and so on, until the 100th time, when you just flip the 100th bulb's switch.\n\nI need to figure out how many bulbs are left on after all these flips.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening to each bulb individually. Let's think about bulb number k, where k ranges from 1 to 100. How many times does its switch get flipped?\n\nWell, on the first pass, every bulb is turned on. So bulb k is on.\n\nOn the second pass, every second bulb is flipped. So bulb 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 have their switches flipped. If k is even, its switch is flipped again.\n\nOn the third pass, every third bulb is flipped. So bulb 3, 6, 9, ..., 99 have their switches flipped. If k is a multiple of 3, its switch is flipped again.\n\nThis pattern continues up to the 100th pass, where only bulb 100's switch is flipped.\n\nSo, for bulb k, its switch is flipped once for each divisor it has. For example, bulb 6 is flipped on pass 1, pass 2, pass 3, and pass 6, because 1, 2, 3, and 6 are its divisors.\n\nSimilarly, bulb 100 is flipped on passes 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100, because these are its divisors.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's list the divisors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. Yes, that's 9 divisors.\n\nSo, in general, the number of times bulb k's switch is flipped is equal to the number of divisors of k.\n\nNow, the bulbs start off, and each flip changes their state: on to off, or off to on.\n\nSo, if a bulb's switch is flipped an odd number of times, it will end up on (since it starts off, and an odd number of flips will leave it on).\n\nIf it's flipped an even number of times, it will end up off (because each pair of flips brings it back to its previous state).\n\nTherefore, the bulbs that are left on are those whose switch was flipped an odd number of times, which corresponds to bulbs with an odd number of divisors.\n\nNow, which numbers have an odd number of divisors?\n\nLet's think about the general case. For a number k, the number of divisors is determined by its prime factorization.\n\nIf k has a prime factorization of p1^a * p2^b * p3^c * ..., then the total number of divisors is (a+1)*(b+1)*(c+1)*...\n\nFor the number of divisors to be odd, each exponent in the factorization must be even, because only then will each (exponent + 1) be odd, and the product will be odd.\n\nWait, actually, more precisely, the number of divisors is odd if and only if k is a perfect square.\n\nWhy is that? Because for non-square numbers, divisors come in pairs. For example, for 6, the divisors are 1 and 6, 2 and 3. So, an even number of divisors.\n\nFor perfect squares, one of the divisors is repeated. For example, for 9, the divisors are 1, 3, and 9. So, an odd number of divisors.\n\nWait, but 9 is 3^2, so its divisor count is 2+1=3, which is odd.\n\nSimilarly, 16 is 2^4, so (4+1)=5 divisors, which is odd.\n\nAnd 100 is 2^2 * 5^2, so (2+1)*(2+1)=9 divisors, which is odd.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nIs that always true?\n\nLet's test with a non-square number, say 6, which is 2*3. Divisors are 1,2,3,6: four divisors, which is even.\n\nAnother example: 8 is 2^3, so (3+1)=4 divisors: 1,2,4,8. Even.\n\n12 is 2^2 * 3^1, so (2+1)*(1+1)=6 divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12. Even.\n\nSo, only perfect squares seem to have an odd number of divisors.\n\nWait, but let's confirm this with another perfect square. Take 36: 2^2 * 3^2, so (2+1)*(2+1)=9 divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36. Odd.\n\nSimilarly, 49: 7^2, (2+1)=3 divisors: 1,7,49. Odd.\n\nSo, it seems that only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nTherefore, the bulbs that are left on are those whose positions are perfect squares.\n\nNow, how many perfect squares are there between 1 and 100?\n\nWell, 1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=9, 4^2=16, 5^2=25, 6^2=36, 7^2=49, 8^2=64, 9^2=81, 10^2=100.\n\nSo, there are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n\nTherefore, after walking by the bulbs 100 times, 10 bulbs will be left on.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this reasoning.\n\nFirst, confirm that only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nYes, because for a number k = p1^a * p2^b * ..., the number of divisors is (a+1)*(b+1)*...\n\nFor this product to be odd, each (a+1), (b+1), etc., must be odd, meaning each exponent a, b, etc., must be even.\n\nTherefore, k must be a perfect square.\n\nHence, only bulbs at positions that are perfect squares will have their switches flipped an odd number of times and thus be on.\n\nNow, list of perfect squares between 1 and 100:\n\n1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.\n\nThat's 10 bulbs.\n\nAlternatively, since 10^2=100, there are 10 perfect squares up to 100.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 10 bulbs left on.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider bulb number 1: it's flipped once (pass 1), so odd number of flips, it's on.\n\nBulb 2: flipped on pass 1 and pass 2, two flips, even, so off.\n\nBulb 3: flipped on pass 1 and pass 3, two flips, even, off.\n\nBulb 4: flipped on pass 1, 2, and 4, three flips, odd, on.\n\nBulb 5: flipped on pass 1 and pass 5, two flips, even, off.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYes, this matches the earlier conclusion that only perfect squares are left on.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 10 bulbs left on.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
