        "content": "The study of genetics has revealed that the human genome is made up of approximately 3 billion base pairs, which are organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes. These chromosomes are located within the nucleus of our cells and are responsible for determining our physical characteristics and biological processes. Genes, which are segments of DNA located on these chromosomes, code for proteins that carry out various functions in the body. Mutations in these genes can lead to a variety of genetic disorders.\nWhich of the following best describes the role of genes in the human body?\nA. They determine the number of chromosomes in our cells\nB. They are responsible for the structure of the cell nucleus\nC. They code for proteins that carry out various functions\nD. They control the number of base pairs in the human genome"
