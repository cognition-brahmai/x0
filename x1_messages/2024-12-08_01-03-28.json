The story goes that a customer at the restaurant where Crum worked complained that their French fries were too thick and not salty enough. In response, Crum decided to\u5207very thin potatoes and salt them heavily, thinking the customer would find them too\u8106to eat. However, the customer loved them, and thus, the potato chip was born. But I might be wrong; perhaps you have more information on this?"
