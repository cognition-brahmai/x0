        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a jar with 8 red marbles, 12 blue marbles, and 20 green marbles. I need to find the probability of drawing a red marble followed by a blue marble without replacing the first marble back into the jar. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's meant by \"without replacement.\" That means once I draw the first marble, I don't put it back into the jar before drawing the second one. So, the total number of marbles changes after the first draw.\n\nAlright, let's start by finding the total number of marbles in the jar initially. There are 8 red, 12 blue, and 20 green marbles. So, total marbles = 8 + 12 + 20 = 40 marbles.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing a red marble first. There are 8 red marbles out of 40 total marbles. So, the probability of drawing a red first is 8/40, which simplifies to 1/5.\n\nNext, since we're not replacing the first marble, the total number of marbles left in the jar after drawing the red marble is 40 - 1 = 39 marbles.\n\nNow, we need to draw a blue marble second. There are still 12 blue marbles in the jar (since we only drew a red one first), and now there are 39 marbles in total. So, the probability of drawing a blue marble second, given that the first was red, is 12/39. Simplifying that, 12/39 reduces to 4/13.\n\nNow, to find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first drawing a red marble and then drawing a blue marble without replacement\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, overall probability = (probability of first event) \u00d7 (probability of second event given the first has occurred).\n\nThat is, overall probability = (1/5) \u00d7 (4/13).\n\nNow, multiplying these fractions: (1 \u00d7 4) / (5 \u00d7 13) = 4/65.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red marble followed by a blue marble without replacement is 4/65.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach this another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to draw a red marble first is 8, and then the number of ways to draw a blue marble second is 12, out of the total ways to draw any two marbles in sequence.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes = 8 (red) \u00d7 12 (blue) = 96.\n\nTotal possible outcomes for drawing two marbles in sequence without replacement = 40 (first draw) \u00d7 39 (second draw) = 1560.\n\nSo, probability = favorable outcomes / total possible outcomes = 96 / 1560.\n\nSimplifying 96/1560, divide numerator and denominator by 16: 96 \u00f7 16 = 6, 1560 \u00f7 16 = 97.5. Wait, that doesn't make sense, 1560 divided by 16 is actually 97.5, but probabilities should be fractions of whole numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I should divide by 8 instead. 96 \u00f7 8 = 12, 1560 \u00f7 8 = 195. So, 12/195.\n\nSimplify further: 12 and 195 are both divisible by 3. 12 \u00f7 3 = 4, 195 \u00f7 3 = 65. So, 4/65.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, so 4/65 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use conditional probability. The probability of drawing a blue marble second given that a red marble was drawn first.\n\nSo, P(Blue second | Red first) = P(Blue second and Red first) / P(Red first).\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with without replacement, it's easier to just calculate P(Red first) and then P(Blue second | Red first) directly, as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the events in sequence, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities, considering the dependency.\n\nSo, P(Red first and Blue second) = P(Red first) \u00d7 P(Blue second | Red first) = (8/40) \u00d7 (12/39) = (1/5) \u00d7 (4/13) = 4/65.\n\nYes, consistent again.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, could the presence of green marbles affect this probability? Well, green marbles are in the jar, but since we're only interested in drawing red followed by blue, the green marbles are effectively neutral in this specific sequence, as long as we're not drawing them in these two draws.\n\nWait, but they affect the total number of marbles, which does impact the probabilities, as I've already accounted for. So, yes, their presence is factored into the total counts.\n\nIs there any chance that after drawing the red marble, the number of blue marbles changes? No, because we only drew a red one; the blue marbles remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, my calculation stands: 4/65.\n\nJust to put it in decimal form for better understanding, 4 divided by 65 is approximately 0.0615, or 6.15%.\n\nSo, there's about a 6.15% chance of drawing a red marble followed by a blue marble without replacement from this jar.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to express it as a decimal, it's approximately 0.0615, but fractions are generally preferred in probability answers.\n\nJust to summarize, the key steps were:\n\n1. Determine the total number of marbles initially: 8 red + 12 blue + 20 green = 40 marbles.\n\n2. Calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first: 8/40 = 1/5.\n\n3. After drawing a red marble, update the total number of marbles: 40 - 1 = 39 marbles.\n\n4. Calculate the probability of drawing a blue marble second, given the first was red: 12/39 = 4/13.\n\n5. Multiply these probabilities to get the overall probability: (1/5) \u00d7 (4/13) = 4/65.\n\nAlternatively, using combinations:\n\n- Favorable outcomes: 8 red \u00d7 12 blue = 96.\n\n- Total possible outcomes: 40 \u00d7 39 = 1560.\n\n- Probability: 96/1560 = 4/65.\n\nBoth methods confirm the same result.\n\nI think that's solid. No missing pieces here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{65}} \\]"
