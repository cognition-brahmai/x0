        "content": "So the shipping company has 10 cargo ships, each with a maximum capacity of 20,000 tons, and they want to increase their total cargo capacity by 25% without buying new ships. They're considering modifying the existing ships to achieve this. The cost for these modifications is $100 per ton added. My task is to figure out how much they need to modify each ship and what the total cost would be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what their current total cargo capacity is. Since they have 10 ships, each carrying up to 20,000 tons, their current total capacity is:\n\n10 ships * 20,000 tons/ship = 200,000 tons\n\nThey want to increase this by 25%. So, the increase in capacity they're aiming for is:\n\n25% of 200,000 tons = 0.25 * 200,000 = 50,000 tons\n\nTherefore, their new total capacity should be:\n\n200,000 tons + 50,000 tons = 250,000 tons\n\nNow, they want to achieve this increase by modifying their existing fleet. Assuming that all 10 ships will be modified equally, each ship would need to have its capacity increased by:\n\n50,000 tons / 10 ships = 5,000 tons per ship\n\nSo, each ship needs to be modified to carry an additional 5,000 tons.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost of these modifications. The cost is $100 per ton added. Therefore, for each ship, the cost would be:\n\n5,000 tons * $100/ton = $500,000 per ship\n\nSince there are 10 ships, the total cost for modifying all ships would be:\n\n10 ships * $500,000/ship = $5,000,000\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider whether it's possible to add 5,000 tons to each ship. Is there a physical limit to how much each ship can be expanded? Also, are there any regulatory or safety constraints that might affect this modification?\n\nAssuming that the ships have the potential to safely carry the additional weight and that there are no regulatory hurdles, then this seems feasible.\n\nHowever, perhaps not all ships need to be modified by the same amount. Maybe some ships have more potential for expansion than others. But since the problem states to assume equal modifications, I'll stick with the initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not all ships need to be modified. Perhaps modifying fewer ships by a larger amount could achieve the same total capacity increase, but the problem specifies that they want to modify the existing fleet without purchasing new ships, and it seems they want to modify all ships equally.\n\nLet me double-check the cost calculation. If each ship needs an additional 5,000 tons and it costs $100 per ton, then $500,000 per ship seems correct. Multiplying that by 10 ships gives a total of $5,000,000, which seems accurate.\n\nAre there any other costs that might be involved? For example, downtime for modifications, crew training, or any additional operational costs? The problem doesn't specify any other costs, so I'll assume that the $100 per ton covers all modification-related expenses.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether the modification affects the ship's speed, fuel efficiency, or other operational aspects. But again, since the problem doesn't provide information on these factors, I'll focus on the capacity and cost aspects.\n\nIn conclusion, to increase the total cargo capacity by 25%, the shipping company needs to modify each of its 10 cargo ships to carry an additional 5,000 tons, resulting in a total modification cost of $5,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5000000} \\]"
