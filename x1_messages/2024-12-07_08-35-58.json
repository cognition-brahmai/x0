        "content": "So, the car depreciates by 15% each year, and its initial value is $25,000. I need to find out its approximate value after 5 years. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that depreciation means the value of the car decreases over time. Since it's depreciating by 15% each year, that means each year the car is worth 85% of its value from the previous year. Because if it loses 15%, it retains 85%.\n\nSo, if the initial value is $25,000, after the first year, it would be $25,000 times 85%, which is $25,000 times 0.85.\n\nLet me calculate that: $25,000 * 0.85 = $21,250.\n\nNow, for the second year, it depreciates by another 15% based on the new value, which is $21,250. So, the value after the second year would be $21,250 * 0.85.\n\nLet's calculate that: $21,250 * 0.85 = $18,062.50.\n\nContinuing this for each year:\n\nThird year: $18,062.50 * 0.85 = $15,353.125.\n\nFourth year: $15,353.125 * 0.85 = $13,049.65625.\n\nFifth year: $13,049.65625 * 0.85 = $11,092.2078125.\n\nSo, after 5 years, the approximate value would be around $11,092.\n\nBut, there might be a more straightforward way to calculate this without doing it year by year. I think there's a formula for depreciation over multiple years.\n\nI recall that for exponential depreciation, the formula is:\n\nFinal Value = Initial Value * (1 - depreciation rate)^number of years.\n\nIn this case, Initial Value = $25,000, depreciation rate = 15% or 0.15, and number of years = 5.\n\nSo, Final Value = $25,000 * (1 - 0.15)^5 = $25,000 * (0.85)^5.\n\nLet me calculate (0.85)^5.\n\n0.85^2 = 0.7225.\n\n0.7225 * 0.85 = 0.614125.\n\n0.614125 * 0.85 = 0.52200625.\n\n0.52200625 * 0.85 = 0.4437053125.\n\nSo, Final Value = $25,000 * 0.4437053125 \u2248 $11,092.63.\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation of around $11,092.\n\nSo, the approximate value of the car after 5 years is $11,092.\n\nBut to make sure, let me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think about depreciation as a straight-line method, where the value decreases by a fixed amount each year. But in this case, it's specified that it's a 15% depreciation each year, which suggests it's exponential decay, not straight-line.\n\nIn straight-line depreciation, you would subtract the same amount each year, but here, since it's a percentage, it's compounded each year.\n\nSo, sticking with the exponential depreciation formula is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the approximate value after 5 years is $11,092.\n\nMaybe I can round it to the nearest dollar, so $11,093.\n\nBut in my earlier calculations, it was $11,092.63, so rounding to $11,093 is fine.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11093} \\]"
