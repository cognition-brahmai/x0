Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, which is the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user query, one or more preceding evidence values, or a mix of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nInternetSearch[input]: Enables the user to perform an internet search to locate websites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nDataScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links, where the input consists of one or more links, and generates plain text output containing the link contents.\nLinkHarvester[input]: Harvests links from plain text and delivers a plain text, newline-separated list of links.\nQAModel[input]: A question-answering model adept at answering questions based on an input text passage. The input must be a text question that refers to a *evidence[n]* variable, e.g., What is the tallest mountain, given *evidence1*?\n\nEach function simply needs a plain string as input, without quotation marks or '+' symbols to connect a string with an evidence variable, like QAModel[What is the longest river, given *evidence3*?].\n\nEnsure you only include one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should adhere to this format:\nPlan: [Initial action based on the input question]\n*evidence0 = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Subsequent action, based on the result of *evidence0]\n*evidence1 = [Next function to call and input parameter, potentially referring to earlier evidence, such as 'Given context *evidence0']\n...\nFinal Answer: [*evidence[n], holding the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who designed the Sydney Opera House and what were the unique architectural features incorporated into its design?"
