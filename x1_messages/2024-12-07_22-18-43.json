It's a lightweight, ductile metal that's highly conductive to both electricity and heat. Despite being the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, it's not found free in nature and must be extracted from its ores, primarily bauxite. Aluminum has a wide range of applications due to its properties, including in the manufacturing of aircraft, automobiles, packaging, and electrical transmission lines."
