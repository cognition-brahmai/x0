        "content": "So if I'm filling up a swimming pool that holds 25,000 gallons, and I'm adding water at a rate of 500 gallons per hour, I need to figure out how many hours it'll take to fill it up completely.\n\nAlright, basic math here. I think I can just divide the total volume of the pool by the rate at which I'm filling it. So, 25,000 gallons divided by 500 gallons per hour.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 25,000 divided by 500. Hmm, 500 times 50 is 25,000. So, it should take 50 hours to fill the pool.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If I'm adding 500 gallons every hour, how many hours will it take to reach 25,000 gallons.\n\nI can set up an equation: hours = total gallons / rate per hour. So, hours = 25,000 / 500.\n\nYes, that gives me 50 hours again. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the filling time. For example, is the water pressure constant? Is there any evaporation happening? But since this is a straightforward problem, I'll assume ideal conditions.\n\nSo, in ideal conditions, it should take 50 hours to fill the pool.\n\nNow, if the filling rate changes over time or if there are any leaks, that could affect the total time. But based on the information given, I'll stick with 50 hours.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If I fill the pool for 50 hours at 500 gallons per hour, the total amount of water added would be 50 hours * 500 gallons/hour = 25,000 gallons. That matches the pool's capacity, so it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to fill it faster, say at 1,000 gallons per hour, it would take only 25 hours. But in this case, it's 500 gallons per hour, so 50 hours.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is in terms of proportions. If 500 gallons take 1 hour, then 25,000 gallons would take (25,000 / 500) hours, which again is 50 hours.\n\nI can also consider the unit analysis: gallons divided by gallons per hour gives hours, which is the correct unit for time.\n\nSo, dimensionally, it makes sense.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe considering the shape of the pool or something, but since the volume is already given, I don't think that's necessary.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer is 50 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
