        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which is 240 miles apart, and it takes 3 hours to do that. They're asking how long it would take to go halfway back to Town A from Town B.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the speed of the train. Since it's traveling at a constant speed, I can use the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nSpeed = 240 miles / 3 hours = 80 miles per hour.\n\nNow, halfway back to Town A from Town B would be half of 240 miles, which is:\n\n240 miles / 2 = 120 miles.\n\nSo, the train needs to travel 120 miles back to Town A.\n\nSince the speed is constant at 80 miles per hour, the time it takes to travel 120 miles can be found using:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nTime = 120 miles / 80 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take the train 1.5 hours to travel halfway back to Town A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, if the train is going back halfway, that means it's traveling 120 miles against the same constant speed of 80 miles per hour. So, time should indeed be 120 miles divided by 80 miles per hour, which is 1.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of proportions. If 240 miles take 3 hours, then 120 miles should take half the time, which is 1.5 hours. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, I think 1.5 hours is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
