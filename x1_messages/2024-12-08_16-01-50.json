So, the riddle is: \"What goes around the world and stays in a corner?\" Hmm, it sounds a bit tricky, but I think I have an idea. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the riddle is asking. It's saying there's something that travels all around the world, but at the same time, it remains in a corner. That seems a bit contradictory because if something goes around the world, it must be moving, but staying in a corner suggests that it's stationary. So, maybe it's something that is present in many places, but in each place, it's in a corner.\n\nLet me consider some possibilities. Could it be a stamp on a letter? A stamp helps the letter travel around the world, but it stays in the corner of the envelope. That seems plausible. Another option could be a postage stamp itself, as it's used to send mail all over the world, but it sticks to the corner of the envelope.\n\nWait, is there another answer? Maybe something more abstract. Like a time zone or something related to geography, but that doesn't seem to fit as well. Or perhaps it's a type of map projection that represents the world and is displayed in a corner somewhere.\n\nLet me see if there's a more fitting answer. Another possibility is a coin, specifically a penny or a specific type of coin that is traded or travels around the world, but stays in a corner, maybe in a collection or a jar. But that doesn't seem to fit perfectly.\n\nI think the stamp option makes the most sense. It's a common answer to this riddle, and it fits the description well. Stamps are used to send mail internationally, so they go around the world, but they stay in the corner of envelopes.\n\nIs there a chance that there's a different answer? Maybe something more modern, like an emoji or a hashtag that's used worldwide but appears in a corner of a screen or a post. That's an interesting thought, but I'm not sure if that's the traditional answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a flag that's displayed in corners of buildings or stadiums worldwide. But again, that doesn't seem to capture the essence of the riddle as well as the stamp does.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other riddles similar to this one. Sometimes riddles have playful or unexpected answers. Maybe it's a letter, like the letter \"e,\" which is present in the alphabet used worldwide and often appears in the corner of pages or documents. But that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a nail. A nail can be found in corners of walls worldwide, and it stays put while the world moves around it. That could work, but it doesn't have the same appeal as the stamp answer.\n\nI think I'll stick with the stamp as the answer. It's a classic response to this riddle, and it makes logical sense. So, the answer is a stamp.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{stamp}} \\]"
