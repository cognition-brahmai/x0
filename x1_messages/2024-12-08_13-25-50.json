        "content": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the total amount of glass needed for the windows of a 100-floor skyscraper. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total exterior wall area of the skyscraper. Since each floor has an area of 10,000 square feet, and there are 100 floors, the total floor area is 10,000 * 100 = 1,000,000 square feet. But wait, this is the floor area, not the wall area. The windows are on the exterior walls, so I need to find the total exterior wall area.\n\nTo find the exterior wall area, I need to know the perimeter of each floor. Assuming the building is a rectangular prism, the perimeter P can be calculated if I know the length L and width W of the floors. Since area A = L * W = 10,000 square feet, but without specific dimensions, I'll have to assume a value for one dimension to find the other. Maybe for simplicity, I can assume it's a square building, so L = W. Then L^2 = 10,000, so L = 100 feet, and P = 4 * 100 = 400 feet.\n\nNow, the height between each floor is 14 feet, so the total height H of the building is 14 * 100 = 1,400 feet.\n\nThe total exterior wall area would be the perimeter times the height, so A_walls = P * H = 400 * 1,400 = 560,000 square feet.\n\nBut this seems off because it's including all four sides, and maybe some areas are not exterior walls, like if there are any courtyards or inner walls. But for now, I'll proceed with this value.\n\nNext, the windows cover 60% of the exterior wall area. So the total window area A_windows = 0.60 * A_walls = 0.60 * 560,000 = 336,000 square feet.\n\nNow, I need to factor in a 5% wastage allowance for cutting and breakage. So the total glass needed G_total = A_windows * (1 + 0.05) = 336,000 * 1.05 = 352,800 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, this seems too straightforward. Let me double-check some assumptions.\n\nFirst, assuming the building is square. Maybe it's not square; maybe it's rectangular. Let's consider that.\n\nSuppose the floor is rectangular with length L and width W, and L * W = 10,000 square feet. The perimeter P = 2(L + W). Without specific values for L and W, I can express P in terms of one variable. Let's say L = 10,000 / W.\n\nThen P = 2(10,000 / W + W) = 20,000 / W + 2W.\n\nThis is minimized when the building is square, as we already assumed. So our earlier assumption doesn't affect the result since we're considering the total exterior wall area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to calculate the exterior wall area without assuming the building shape.\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of the building's surface area. A skyscraper typically has four exterior walls. Each wall has an area of height H times width W.\n\nAssuming all four walls are identical, which may not be the case, but for simplicity, let's proceed.\n\nTotal exterior wall area would be 4 * H * W.\n\nBut I know that the floor area is L * W = 10,000 square feet.\n\nIf the building is rectangular, with length L and width W, then the exterior walls would have areas of H * L and H * W.\n\nAssuming two walls with area H * L and two with H * W, the total exterior wall area would be 2(H * L) + 2(H * W) = 2H(L + W).\n\nBut since L * W = 10,000, and without specific values for L and W, I'm back to the same expression as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the building's aspect ratio or look for another way to find the perimeter.\n\nMaybe I should consider the building's height and the floor-to-floor height.\n\nGiven that each floor has a height of 14 feet, and there are 100 floors, the total height is indeed 14 * 100 = 1,400 feet.\n\nNow, perhaps I can find the building's dimensions based on typical skyscraper designs or building codes, but that might be too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the building has a different number of exterior walls or some walls are shorter due to setbacks or other features.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll stick with the initial assumption of a rectangular building with four exterior walls, each with height 1,400 feet and lengths corresponding to the building's length and width, which multiply to 10,000 square feet.\n\nGiven that, the total exterior wall area is 2*(L + W)*H = 2*(L + W)*1,400.\n\nBut since L * W = 10,000, I can't determine L + W without additional information.\n\nHowever, in the context of this problem, perhaps the exact shape doesn't matter because the product L * W is constant, and the perimeter is minimized when the building is square.\n\nTherefore, assuming a square building with L = W = 100 feet, the perimeter P = 400 feet, and total exterior wall area A_walls = P * H = 400 * 1,400 = 560,000 square feet.\n\nThen, windows cover 60% of that, so A_windows = 0.60 * 560,000 = 336,000 square feet.\n\nAdding a 5% wastage allowance, G_total = 336,000 * 1.05 = 352,800 square feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the windows are only on the exterior walls and not on the top or bottom, which makes sense, then my calculation seems reasonable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total surface area of the exterior walls and then apply the percentage covered by windows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nLet me consider the building as a prism with a base area of 10,000 square feet and a height of 1,400 feet.\n\nThe lateral surface area (exterior walls) would be the perimeter of the base times the height.\n\nAgain, without knowing the base shape, I'll assume it's a rectangle with L * W = 10,000.\n\nThus, perimeter P = 2(L + W), and A_walls = P * H = 2(L + W)*1,400.\n\nBut to minimize the perimeter for a given area, the base should be a square, which we've already assumed.\n\nTherefore, my earlier calculation seems valid.\n\nSo, total window area A_windows = 0.60 * 560,000 = 336,000 square feet.\n\nWith 5% wastage, G_total = 336,000 * 1.05 = 352,800 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of glass needed is 352,800 square feet.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider that the top floor might have a different height or that the building has a roof that affects the window area.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, I'll stick with this calculation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{352800} \\]"
