        "content": "So there are 5 people in a room with an average age of 30 years. That means the total age of all 5 people combined is 5 times 30, which is 150 years. Right?\n\nNow, a 25-year-old person enters the room. So, the total number of people now is 5 plus 1, which is 6 people.\n\nThe total age of all the people now would be the original 150 years plus the 25 years of the new person, which equals 175 years.\n\nTo find the new average age, we divide the total age by the number of people, so 175 divided by 6.\n\nLet me calculate that: 175 divided by 6 is approximately 29.1667 years.\n\nSo, the new average age of all the people in the room is about 29.17 years.\n\nBut maybe I should check my calculations to make sure.\n\nOriginal total age: 5 people times 30 years each equals 150 years.\n\nAdding the 25-year-old: 150 + 25 = 175 years.\n\nTotal people now: 6.\n\nAverage age: 175 / 6 = 29.1667 years.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of the change in average.\n\nWhen a person enters, the average age changes based on how their age compares to the current average.\n\nSince the new person is 25 years old and the original average is 30, which is 5 years less than the original average.\n\nWith 5 original people, the total age is 150.\n\nAdding the new person: 150 + 25 = 175.\n\nTotal people: 6.\n\nAverage: 175 / 6 = 29.1667 years.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is that the new person is bringing down the average by their age being below the original average.\n\nThe difference is 30 - 25 = 5 years.\n\nWith 6 people now, the average decreases by some amount.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating it.\n\nThe straightforward method is best: total age divided by number of people.\n\nSo, the new average is approximately 29.17 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{29.\\overline{16}} \\]"
