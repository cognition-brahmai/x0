However, it's important to note that Columbus didn't actually set foot on the mainland of North America; his voyages primarily explored the Caribbean islands. Additionally, as you mentioned, Columbus initially believed that he had reached Asia, specifically the Indies, which is why the indigenous peoples were called \"Indians.\" The misunderstanding persisted for some time, and it was only later that it became clear that Columbus had discovered a new continent unknown to Europeans at the time."
