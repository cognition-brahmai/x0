        "content": "Sure! Below is a simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in Golang. This program sorts an array of integers in ascending order.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// BubbleSort function to sort the array\nfunc bubbleSort(arr []int) {\n    n := len(arr)\n    for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {\n        // Last i elements are already in place\n        for j := 0; j < n-i-1; j++ {\n            // Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] {\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Sample array\n    arr := []int{64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90}\n\n    fmt.Println(\"Original array:\")\n    fmt.Println(arr)\n\n    // Sorting the array\n    bubbleSort(arr)\n\n    fmt.Println(\"Sorted array:\")\n    fmt.Println(arr)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Bubble Sort Algorithm**:\n   - It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n   - The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n   \n2. **Implementation**:\n   - The `bubbleSort` function takes a slice of integers as input.\n   - It uses two nested loops: the outer loop runs from the start to the end of the array, and the inner loop compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n   - This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - A sample array is defined and printed.\n   - The `bubbleSort` function is called to sort the array.\n   - The sorted array is then printed.\n\nThis program demonstrates a basic implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in Golang. Note that bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets, but it is simple and easy to understand, making it a good starting point for learning about sorting algorithms."
