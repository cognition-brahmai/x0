        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to perform some SQL queries on a database called \"school\". Let's see what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the tables in the \"school\" database. To do that, I can use the SQL command \"SHOW TABLES\". So, the query would be:\n\nSHOW TABLES;\n\nNext, I need to retrieve all records from a table named \"students\". For this, I'll use the \"SELECT\" statement. The query should look like this:\n\nSELECT * FROM students;\n\nNow, I have to update a student's grade in a table named \"grades\". To update a record, I'll use the \"UPDATE\" statement. However, I need to specify which student's grade to update and what the new grade should be. Let's assume I want to update the grade for a student with a specific student ID, say student_id = 1, and set their grade to 'A'. The query would be:\n\nUPDATE grades SET grade = 'A' WHERE student_id = 1;\n\nFinally, I need to delete a record from a table named \"teachers\". To delete a record, I'll use the \"DELETE\" statement. Again, I need to specify which record to delete, perhaps by teacher ID. Let's say I want to delete the teacher with teacher_id = 2. The query would be:\n\nDELETE FROM teachers WHERE teacher_id = 2;\n\nMake sure to handle these operations carefully, especially deletion, as it can permanently remove data from the database.\n\n**Summary of Queries:**\n\n1. Show all tables:\n\n   ```sql\n   SHOW TABLES;\n   ```\n\n2. Retrieve all students:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM students;\n   ```\n\n3. Update a student's grade:\n\n   ```sql\n   UPDATE grades SET grade = 'A' WHERE student_id = 1;\n   ```\n\n4. Delete a teacher:\n\n   ```sql\n   DELETE FROM teachers WHERE teacher_id = 2;\n   ```"
