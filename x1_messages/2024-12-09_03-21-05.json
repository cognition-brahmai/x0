        "content": "I'm here to help you with your Python script that interacts with the Google Maps API to find the shortest route between two locations. Let's get started!\n\nFirst, you'll need to have the Google Maps Platform set up and obtain an API key. Have you already done that?\n\nIf not, here's a quick guide:\n\n1. Go to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com).\n\n2. Create a new project or select an existing one.\n\n3. Enable the \"Directions API\" for your project.\n\n4. Create an API key.\n\nMake sure to enable billing, as some features may have costs associated with them.\n\nOnce you have your API key, you can proceed to install the necessary Python library. We'll be using the `googlemaps` library, which is a Python client for Google Maps services.\n\nYou can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install googlemaps\n```\n\nNow, let's outline the steps for your script:\n\n1. **Input Locations:** Get the starting and ending locations from the user.\n\n2. **API Request:** Use the Google Maps Directions API to get the route between these two points.\n\n3. **Parse Response:** Extract the total distance, estimated travel time, and step-by-step directions from the API response.\n\n4. **Display Information:** Print this information in a user-friendly format.\n\nLet's start by importing the necessary library and setting up the API key.\n\n```python\nimport googlemaps\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Google Maps API key\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\ngmaps = googlemaps.Client(key=api_key)\n```\n\nNext, we'll get the starting and ending locations from the user.\n\n```python\nstart_location = input(\"Enter starting location: \")\nend_location = input(\"Enter ending location: \")\n```\n\nNow, we'll use the Directions API to get the route.\n\n```python\n# Request directions\ndirections = gmaps.directions(start_location, end_location, mode=\"driving\")\n```\n\nThe `directions` variable will contain a list of routes, and each route contains legs with steps. We'll need to extract the total distance and duration from the first route.\n\n```python\nif directions:\n    route = directions[0]\n    legs = route['legs'][0]\n    \n    distance = legs['distance']['text']\n    duration = legs['duration']['text']\n    \n    print(f\"Total Distance: {distance}\")\n    print(f\"Estimated Travel Time: {duration}\")\n    \n    steps = legs['steps']\n    print(\"\\nStep-by-Step Directions:\")\n    for step in steps:\n        instruction = step['html_instructions'].replace('<b>', '').replace('</b>', '').replace('<div style=\"font-size:0.9em\">', ' ').replace('</div>', '')\n        print(instruction)\nelse:\n    print(\"No directions found.\")\n```\n\nThis script will print the total distance and estimated travel time, followed by step-by-step directions.\n\nA few things to note:\n\n- Make sure to handle cases where no directions are found, such as invalid locations.\n\n- The step instructions might contain HTML tags, which we're removing here for simplicity.\n\n- You can customize the mode of transportation by changing the `mode` parameter in the `directions` method (e.g., \"walking\", \"transit\", \"bicycling\").\n\n- For more accurate results, you can specify additional parameters like departure time or traffic model.\n\nHere's the complete script:\n\n```python\nimport googlemaps\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Google Maps API key\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\ngmaps = googlemaps.Client(key=api_key)\n\nstart_location = input(\"Enter starting location: \")\nend_location = input(\"Enter ending location: \")\n\n# Request directions\ndirections = gmaps.directions(start_location, end_location, mode=\"driving\")\n\nif directions:\n    route = directions[0]\n    legs = route['legs'][0]\n    \n    distance = legs['distance']['text']\n    duration = legs['duration']['text']\n    \n    print(f\"Total Distance: {distance}\")\n    print(f\"Estimated Travel Time: {duration}\")\n    \n    steps = legs['steps']\n    print(\"\\nStep-by-Step Directions:\")\n    for step in steps:\n        instruction = step['html_instructions'].replace('<b>', '').replace('</b>', '').replace('<div style=\"font-size:0.9em\">', ' ').replace('</div>', '')\n        print(instruction)\nelse:\n    print(\"No directions found.\")\n```\n\nRemember to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point.
