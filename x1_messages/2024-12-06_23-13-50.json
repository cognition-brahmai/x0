        "content": "So in this village, there are 20 people, and each person has either a cat or a dog as a pet. Out of these 20 people, 8 have cats. So, to find out how many dogs there are, I need to figure out how many people have dogs.\n\nSince every person has either a cat or a dog, the total number of pets should equal the total number of people, which is 20. If 8 people have cats, then the remaining people must have dogs.\n\nSo, the number of people who have dogs would be the total number of people minus the number of people who have cats. That is:\n\nNumber of dog owners = Total people - Number of cat owners\nNumber of dog owners = 20 - 8\nNumber of dog owners = 12\n\nNow, the question is about the number of dogs, not necessarily the number of dog owners. But in this context, since each person has one pet, and those who don't have cats have dogs, the number of dogs should be equal to the number of dog owners.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 dogs in the village.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's make sure that each person has only one pet. The problem says, \"every person has either a cat or a dog as a pet.\" It seems to imply that each person has one pet, either a cat or a dog.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, if there's a possibility that some people might have more than one pet, but the problem doesn't specify that. Given the wording, it's safe to assume that each person has exactly one pet.\n\nSo, with that assumption, the number of dogs is equal to the number of people who have dogs, which is 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 dogs in the village.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
