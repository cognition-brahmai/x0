        "content": "Alright, I'm going to create a Python program that implements a stack data structure. Stacks are fundamental data structures that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.\n\nI need to implement four main operations for the stack:\n\n1. **push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.\n\n2. **pop**: Removes the element from the top of the stack and returns it.\n\n3. **peek**: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.\n\n4. **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.\n\nTo implement the stack, I can use a list in Python, as lists provide dynamic array implementations that are efficient for stack operations.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this. I'll create a class called `Stack` that will have these methods. I'll use a list as the underlying data structure for the stack.\n\nFirst, in the `__init__` method, I'll initialize an empty list that will serve as the stack.\n\nFor the `push` method, I'll use the `append` method of the list to add elements to the top of the stack.\n\nThe `pop` method will use the `pop` method of the list to remove and return the top element. I should also handle the case where the stack is empty to avoid errors.\n\nThe `peek` method will return the last element of the list without removing it. Again, I need to handle the case where the stack is empty.\n\nThe `isEmpty` method will check if the list is empty and return a boolean value.\n\nLet me also consider how to handle errors, especially when trying to pop or peek from an empty stack. I could raise an exception or return a specific value to indicate that the stack is empty.\n\nI think raising an exception is a good approach, as it makes it clear that an invalid operation was attempted.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the class:\n\n```\n\nclass Stack:\n\ndef __init__(self):\n\nself.stack = []\n\ndef push(self, item):\n\nself.stack.append(item)\n\ndef pop(self):\n\nif self.isEmpty():\n\nraise IndexError(\"pop from empty stack\")\n\nreturn self.stack.pop()\n\ndef peek(self):\n\nif self.isEmpty():\n\nraise IndexError(\"peek from empty stack\")\n\nreturn self.stack[-1]\n\ndef isEmpty(self):\n\nreturn len(self.stack) == 0\n\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, I should think about any potential issues or edge cases.\n\n- Pushing multiple items and popping them off in the correct order.\n\n- Popping or peeking from an empty stack should raise an exception.\n\n- Checking if the stack is empty when it first starts.\n\n- Handling a large number of items to ensure there are no performance issues, but since lists in Python are efficient, this should not be a problem.\n\nI should also consider if I need to add any additional methods, but for now, I'll stick to the basic stack operations.\n\nLet me think about how to test this implementation.\n\nI can create an instance of the Stack class and perform a series of operations to verify that everything works as expected.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Create a new stack and check if it's empty.\n\n- Push some items onto the stack and verify that they are added correctly.\n\n- Use peek to check the top item without removing it.\n\n- Pop items from the stack and confirm that they are removed in the correct order.\n\n- Try to pop or peek from an empty stack to ensure that exceptions are raised.\n\nI should also consider the time complexity of each operation. Since I'm using a list, the push and pop operations should be O(1) on average, which is efficient.\n\nAlright, I think I have a good plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the actual code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement a stack data structure in Python, we can use a list, which provides dynamic array capabilities and efficient operations for adding and removing elements from the end of the list. This aligns perfectly with the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle of stacks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Use an empty list to represent the stack.\n2. **Push Operation**: Use the `append` method to add elements to the top of the stack.\n3. **Pop Operation**: Use the `pop` method to remove and return the top element. Include a check to raise an `IndexError` if the stack is empty.\n4. **Peek Operation**: Return the last element of the list without removing it. Include a check to raise an `IndexError` if the stack is empty.\n5. **IsEmpty Operation**: Check if the list is empty by checking its length.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass Stack:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stack = []\n\n    def push(self, item):\n        self.stack.append(item)\n\n    def pop(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            raise IndexError(\"pop from empty stack\")\n        return self.stack.pop()\n\n    def peek(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            raise IndexError(\"peek from empty stack\")\n        return self.stack[-1]\n\n    def isEmpty(self):\n        return len(self.stack) == 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Creates an empty list `stack` to store the elements.\n- **Push Operation**: The `push` method uses `append` to add a new item to the end of the list, which is the top of the stack.\n- **Pop Operation**: The `pop` method checks if the stack is empty and raises an `IndexError` if it is. Otherwise, it uses `pop` to remove and return the top element.\n- **Peek Operation**: The `peek` method checks if the stack is empty and raises an `IndexError` if it is. Otherwise, it returns the last element of the list without removing it.\n- **IsEmpty Operation**: The `isEmpty` method returns `True` if the stack (list) is empty, otherwise `False`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that all stack operations are performed efficiently, adhering to the LIFO principle."
