        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store selling apples and oranges. Apples cost $1.50 each, and oranges cost $1.00 each. A customer buys a total of 15 fruits and spends $18.00. We need to find out how many apples and oranges they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of apples.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the number of oranges.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of fruits is 15.\n\n2. The total cost is $18.00.\n\nSo, we can set up two equations based on this information.\n\nThe first equation is about the total number of fruits:\n\n\\[ a + o = 15 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total cost:\n\n\\[ 1.50a + 1.00o = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I\u2019ll use the substitution method here.\n\nFirst, solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let\u2019s solve for \\( o \\):\n\n\\[ o = 15 - a \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( o \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 1.50a + 1.00(15 - a) = 18 \\]\n\nNow, let\u2019s simplify and solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ 1.50a + 15 - a = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ (1.50a - a) + 15 = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.50a + 15 = 18 \\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.50a = 3 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.50:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{3}{0.50} \\]\n\n\\[ a = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 6 apples.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation for \\( o \\):\n\n\\[ o = 15 - a \\]\n\n\\[ o = 15 - 6 \\]\n\n\\[ o = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 6 apples and 9 oranges.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check this to make sure it adds up.\n\nFirst, total fruits:\n\n\\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \\]\n\nThat\u2019s correct.\n\nNow, total cost:\n\n\\[ (6 \\times 1.50) + (9 \\times 1.00) = 9 + 9 = 18 \\]\n\nThat matches the total spent.\n\nSo, the solution is correct. The customer bought 6 apples and 9 oranges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ apples and } 9 \\text{ oranges}} \\]"
