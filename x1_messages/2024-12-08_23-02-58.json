        "content": "So I need to prove that the determinant of a square matrix A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. Hmm, eigenvalues are those special scalars \u03bb where A minus \u03bb times the identity matrix has a non-trivial solution, right? So, Ax = \u03bbx for some non-zero vector x.\n\nFirst, I recall that the eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of A, which is defined as p(\u03bb) = det(A - \u03bbI). So, if I can express this determinant in terms of its eigenvalues, that might lead me to the proof.\n\nLet's consider that A is an n x n matrix, and it has n eigenvalues, say \u03bb1, \u03bb2, ..., \u03bbn, not necessarily distinct. The characteristic polynomial p(\u03bb) is a polynomial of degree n, and it can be factored as p(\u03bb) = (\u03bb1 - \u03bb)(\u03bb2 - \u03bb)...(\u03bbn - \u03bb), up to a constant multiple.\n\nWait, actually, the leading coefficient of the characteristic polynomial is (-1)^n, because p(\u03bb) = det(A - \u03bbI) expands to (-\u03bb)^n + ... + det(A). So, more precisely, p(\u03bb) = (-1)^n (\u03bb - \u03bb1)(\u03bb - \u03bb2)...(\u03bb - \u03bbn).\n\nNow, if I set \u03bb = 0 in this equation, I get p(0) = det(A - 0*I) = det(A) = (-1)^n (0 - \u03bb1)(0 - \u03bb2)...(0 - \u03bbn) = (-1)^n (-\u03bb1)(-\u03bb2)...(-\u03bbn) = (-1)^n * (-1)^n * \u03bb1 \u03bb2 ... \u03bbn = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 ... \u03bbn.\n\nSo, det(A) = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 ... \u03bbn, which is the product of the eigenvalues.\n\nWait, that seems almost too straightforward. Is there a catch here? Maybe I need to consider whether A is diagonalizable or not. Does this hold for any square matrix, regardless of whether it's diagonalizable or not?\n\nLet me think about that. Eigenvalues are defined through the characteristic equation, and every square matrix has eigenvalues, even if they are complex and not distinct. The characteristic polynomial always has degree n, and thus n roots in the complex numbers, counting multiplicities.\n\nSo, even if A is not diagonalizable, meaning it doesn't have a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors, the product of its eigenvalues should still equal the determinant.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider the Jordan canonical form. Any square matrix A is similar to its Jordan form J, so A = PJP^-1 for some invertible matrix P. The determinant is similar under similarity transformations, meaning det(A) = det(PJP^-1) = det(P) det(J) det(P^-1) = det(J), since det(P) det(P^-1) = 1.\n\nNow, the Jordan form J is upper triangular, and the determinant of an upper triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries. The diagonal entries of J are exactly the eigenvalues of A, each repeated according to its algebraic multiplicity.\n\nTherefore, det(J) = product of the diagonal entries of J = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 ... \u03bbn.\n\nHence, det(A) = det(J) = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 ... \u03bbn.\n\nThis seems to confirm the initial result, and it works regardless of whether A is diagonalizable or not.\n\nLet me try another approach to ensure I understand this fully. Suppose A is a diagonal matrix, say D = diag(\u03bb1, \u03bb2, ..., \u03bbn). Then, clearly, the eigenvalues are \u03bb1, \u03bb2, ..., \u03bbn, and det(D) = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 ... \u03bbn, which matches the product of the eigenvalues.\n\nIf A is diagonalizable, then A = PDP^-1, where D is diagonal with the eigenvalues on the diagonal. Again, det(A) = det(PDP^-1) = det(D) = product of the eigenvalues.\n\nFor a general matrix, even if not diagonalizable, the Jordan form still has the eigenvalues on the diagonal, and the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues.\n\nIs there any exception to this rule? Maybe if A is a defective matrix, meaning it doesn't have n linearly independent eigenvectors. But even in that case, the Jordan form still exists, and the determinant is still the product of the eigenvalues.\n\nWait, what about the case when A has zero eigenvalues? If one of the eigenvalues is zero, then the product of the eigenvalues is zero, and indeed, det(A) should be zero, which makes sense because A is singular if it has a zero eigenvalue.\n\nAlso, what if some eigenvalues are complex? The determinant is still the product of the eigenvalues, even if some of them are complex. This is acceptable because the determinant can be complex if the matrix has complex entries; otherwise, if the matrix is real with complex eigenvalues, the complex eigenvalues come in conjugate pairs, and their product is real.\n\nLet me consider a simple example to verify this.\n\nTake A = [0 1; 0 0], a 2x2 nilpotent matrix. Its eigenvalues are 0 and 0, since det(A - \u03bbI) = det([-\u03bb 1; 0 -\u03bb]) = \u03bb^2. So, eigenvalues are both 0. Indeed, det(A) = 0*0 - 0*1 = 0, which matches the product of the eigenvalues.\n\nAnother example: A = [1 0; 0 2]. Eigenvalues are 1 and 2. Det(A) = 1*2 - 0*0 = 2, which is the product of the eigenvalues.\n\nOne more: A = [0 1; -1 0]. Characteristic polynomial is det([ -\u03bb 1; -1 -\u03bb ]) = \u03bb^2 + 1. So, eigenvalues are i and -i. Product is i*(-i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. Det(A) = (0)(0) - (1)(-1) = 1, which matches.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the determinant of a square matrix A is indeed equal to the product of its eigenvalues, considering algebraic multiplicities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\det(A) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i} \\]"
