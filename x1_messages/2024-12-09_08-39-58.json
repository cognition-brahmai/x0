Since I'm not entirely sure about all the details, I think the best way to approach this is to look it up on Wikipedia. Wikipedia usually has comprehensive articles on historical events, so that should be a good starting point.\n\nSo, my first plan is to search for \"Battle of Waterloo\" on Wikipedia to get an overview of the event, its significance, and the key figures involved. I'll call the Wikipedia tool for this.\n\n#E1 = Wikipedia[\"Battle of Waterloo\"]\n\nOnce I have that information, I can read through it and pick out the most important points regarding its significance and the key figures. If there's any part that's unclear or if I need more information on a specific aspect, I can then decide whether to look up additional information or try to get clarification using the QA tool.\n\nFor now, starting with Wikipedia should suffice. After reviewing #E1, I can summarize the significance and list the key figures based on the information provided.\n\n**Final answer:** #E1"
