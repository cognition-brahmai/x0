        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a movie theater with 15 rows, and each row has 20 seats. First, I need to figure out the total number of seats in the theater.\n\nTo find the total seats, I can multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row. So, that's 15 rows times 20 seats per row. Let me do that calculation:\n\n15 \u00d7 20 = 300\n\nSo, there are 300 seats in total in the theater.\n\nNow, the problem says the theater is half full. That means half of the total seats are occupied. To find out how many seats are occupied, I need to calculate half of 300.\n\nHalf of 300 is:\n\n300 \u00f7 2 = 150\n\nTherefore, 150 seats are occupied.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way could be to calculate the number of occupied seats per row and then multiply by the number of rows.\n\nSince each row has 20 seats and the theater is half full, each row should have half of its seats occupied. So, half of 20 is 10. Therefore, each row has 10 occupied seats.\n\nNow, with 15 rows, the total occupied seats would be:\n\n15 rows \u00d7 10 seats per row = 150 seats\n\nThat matches my previous calculation. So, 150 seats are occupied.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider if there's any other factor that might affect the number of occupied seats. For example, is there any possibility that not all rows are present or something like that? But according to the problem, there are 15 rows with 20 seats each, and it's half full. So, no, that seems straightforward.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all seats are necessarily available. For instance, maybe some seats are broken or reserved. But the problem doesn't mention any such constraints, so I can assume all seats are available and that \"half full\" means exactly half of the total seats are occupied.\n\nSo, sticking with my original answer, 150 seats are occupied.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
