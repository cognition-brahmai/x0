        "content": "So I have this problem here: I've got a bag with 100 marbles. Seventy percent of them are red, and the rest are blue. I need to figure out how many blue marbles there are and explain how I got there.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what percentages mean. Percentages are like parts of a whole, where the whole is 100%. So, if something is 70%, it means it's 70 parts out of 100.\n\nIn this case, 70% of the marbles are red. That means out of every 100 marbles, 70 are red. Since the total number of marbles is 100, I can directly take 70% of 100 to find the number of red marbles.\n\nTo calculate 70% of 100, I can use the formula:\n\nNumber of red marbles = (percentage of red marbles / 100) * total number of marbles\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of red marbles = (70 / 100) * 100 = 70 marbles\n\nNow, since the rest of the marbles are blue, I can find the number of blue marbles by subtracting the number of red marbles from the total number of marbles.\n\nNumber of blue marbles = total marbles - red marbles = 100 - 70 = 30 marbles\n\nSo, there are 30 blue marbles in the bag.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the percentage of blue marbles directly. Since 70% are red, the remaining percentage must be blue.\n\nPercentage of blue marbles = 100% - 70% = 30%\n\nThen, to find the number of blue marbles, I can calculate 30% of 100.\n\nNumber of blue marbles = (30 / 100) * 100 = 30 marbles\n\nEither way, I end up with 30 blue marbles.\n\nTo make sure I'm understanding this correctly, let's consider another approach. If 70 out of 100 marbles are red, that's the same as saying 70% are red. The remaining marbles must be blue, so 30 out of 100 are blue, which is 30%.\n\nI can also think about proportions. The ratio of red marbles to total marbles is 70:100, which simplifies to 7:10. Similarly, the ratio of blue marbles to total marbles is 30:100, or 3:10.\n\nUsing these ratios, if I have 100 marbles in total, the number of blue marbles would be (3/10) * 100 = 30 marbles.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same answer, which reinforces that I've got it right.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what would happen if the total number of marbles was different. Suppose I had 200 marbles, and still, 70% are red. Then, the number of red marbles would be (70/100)*200 = 140 marbles, and the number of blue marbles would be 200 - 140 = 60 marbles, or 30% of 200.\n\nBut in this specific problem, the total is 100 marbles, so the number of blue marbles is 30.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The answer is 30 blue marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
