        "content": "Let's see if we can figure this out. So, there are four boxes: A, B, C, and D, each with a different number of apples. We know that Box A has more apples than Box B but fewer apples than Box C. Also, Box D has the least number of apples. And the total number of apples in all boxes is 100.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the relationships between the boxes:\n\n1. Box A has more apples than Box B: A > B\n\n2. Box A has fewer apples than Box C: A < C\n\n3. Box D has the least number of apples: D < A, D < B, D < C\n\nSo, from these inequalities, we can arrange them in order:\n\nSince D is the smallest, D < B < A < C\n\nWait, but A > B and A < C, so C is the largest, then A, then B, then D.\n\nSo the order is D < B < A < C\n\nNow, we need to find specific numbers for A, B, C, and D that satisfy these inequalities and add up to 100.\n\nBut the problem is that there are infinite possibilities for the number of apples in each box as long as they satisfy D < B < A < C and A + B + C + D = 100.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet's assume D has 10 apples.\n\nThen B has more than 10, say 20.\n\nA has more than 20, say 30.\n\nC has more than 30, say 40.\n\nBut 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 100.\n\nThat works.\n\nAnother possibility:\n\nD has 15, B has 25, A has 35, C has 25. Wait, but A < C and A > B, but in this case, C = 25 which is less than A=35. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, C has to be greater than A.\n\nSo C > A > B > D.\n\nSo in the above example, if C is 35, A is 30, B is 25, D is 15, then 15 + 25 + 30 + 35 = 105, which is over 100.\n\nWait, perhaps C=35, A=30, B=25, D=10: 10 + 25 + 30 + 35 = 100.\n\nBut in this case, B=25 and D=10, which satisfies D < B.\n\nAnd A=30 > B=25, and C=35 > A=30.\n\nSo that works too.\n\nAnother possibility: D=5, B=15, A=25, C=55: 5 + 15 + 25 + 55 = 100.\n\nOr D=20, B=25, A=30, C=25. Wait, but C has to be greater than A, which is 30, so C has to be more than 30. So if C=25, that doesn't work.\n\nSo C has to be the largest.\n\nWait, but in the first example, C=40, A=30, B=20, D=10: that works.\n\nOr C=50, A=30, B=20, D=0: but D has to have at least 1 apple, assuming \"different numbers\" means positive integers.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify that the number of apples has to be positive integers, but it's reasonable to assume that.\n\nSo, in all these cases, as long as D < B < A < C and A + B + C + D = 100, it's valid.\n\nSo, there are multiple solutions possible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine the exact number of apples in each box with the given information.\n\nWe need more specific constraints to find unique values for A, B, C, and D.\n\nFor example, if we knew the difference between A and B, or some other relationship, we might be able to find specific values.\n\nBut with just the information provided, it's not possible to determine the exact number of apples in each box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{No, we cannot determine the exact number of apples in each box with the given information.}}\\]"
