        "content": "Anthropologists often study the cultural practices of different societies to understand their social structures and norms. For instance, the Trobriand Islanders of Papua New Guinea are known for their complex matrilineal system, where lineage and inheritance are traced through the mother's line. In contrast, the Maasai people of East Africa follow a patriarchal system, where men hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, and control of property. The Yanomami tribe in the Amazon Rainforest, on the other hand, has a more egalitarian society where decisions are made through consensus and both men and women contribute to the community. Based on these examples, which of the following is a key focus of cultural anthropology?\nA. Understanding the social structures and norms of different societies\nB. Studying the biological evolution of humans\nC. Analyzing ancient artifacts to trace human history\nD. Investigating the linguistic variations among different societies\nE. None of the above"

        "content": "Based on the examples provided about the Trobriand Islanders, the Maasai people, and the Yanomami tribe, it's clear that cultural anthropology focuses on understanding the social structures and norms of different societies. Each of these societies has distinct cultural practices regarding lineage, inheritance, leadership, and decision-making processes.\n\nThe Trobriand Islanders have a matrilineal system, which is a type of social structure where descent and inheritance are passed down through the female line. This is in contrast to the Maasai people, who have a patriarchal system where men hold primary power in various aspects of society. The Yanomami tribe, meanwhile, exhibits more egalitarian characteristics, with decisions made through consensus and equal contributions from both men and women.\n\nThese examples illustrate how cultural anthropology examines and compares the diverse ways in which human societies organize themselves socially and culturally. It involves studying the norms, values, beliefs, and practices that shape these societies.\n\nOption A directly corresponds to this focus: \"Understanding the social structures and norms of different societies.\" \n\nOption B, \"Studying the biological evolution of humans,\" is more related to physical anthropology or evolutionary biology, which deals with the biological aspects of human development and evolution.\n\nOption C, \"Analyzing ancient artifacts to trace human history,\" falls under the domain of archaeology, which is a subfield of anthropology but focuses specifically on material remains to understand past human cultures.\n\nOption D, \"Investigating the linguistic variations among different societies,\" pertains to linguistic anthropology, which is concerned with the study of language and its role in social life.\n\nTherefore, based on the examples given, the key focus of cultural anthropology is best represented by option A: Understanding the social structures and norms of different societies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
