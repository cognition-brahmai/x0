        "content": "The scientific field that primarily studies extraterrestrial rocks, such as those brought back by the Apollo astronauts from the Moon, is called lunar science or selenology. However, more broadly, the study of extraterrestrial rocks falls under planetary science or astrogeology.\n\nPlanetary scientists and geochemists analyze these samples to understand the Moon's composition, geological history, and its formation. These studies have provided valuable insights into the Moon's origin, such as the giant impact hypothesis, which suggests that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.\n\nMoreover, these lunar samples have been crucial in determining the age of lunar rock formations, understanding the Moon's internal structure, and studying the effects of meteorite impacts on its surface. The analysis of lunar rocks has also helped scientists to better understand the geological processes that occur on other planetary bodies in our solar system.\n\nIn addition to planetary science, the study of extraterrestrial materials also involves cosmochemistry, which examines the chemical and isotopic compositions of meteorites and other extraterrestrial materials to understand the origin and evolution of the solar system.\n\nOverall, the interdisciplinary approach to studying lunar samples has significantly enhanced our knowledge of the Moon and its place in the solar system."
