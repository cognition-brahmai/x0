        "content": "The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, the garden measures 18 meters in one direction and 24 meters in the other. So, to find the area, you would multiply 18 meters by 24 meters.\n\nLet me do the calculation step by step to ensure accuracy. First, I'll multiply 18 by 20, which equals 360. Then, I'll multiply 18 by 4, which is 72. Now, I'll add those two results together: 360 plus 72 equals 432.\n\nTherefore, the area of the garden is 432 square meters.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to calculate this. I could also consider multiplying 24 by 18.\n\nLet's break it down again. 24 multiplied by 10 is 240, and 24 multiplied by 8 is 192. Adding those together, 240 plus 192, also gives me 432.\n\nSo, yes, the area is definitely 432 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I remember the formula for the area of a rectangle, it's length times width, so 18m * 24m = 432 m\u00b2.\n\nI think that's straightforward. But just to be thorough, I can also visualize the garden as being divided into smaller sections. For example, imagine dividing the garden into squares of 1 meter by 1 meter. There would be 18 rows and 24 columns of these squares. So, the total number of squares would be 18 times 24, which again is 432.\n\nThis method helps to understand the concept behind the formula. Each square represents 1 square meter, and multiplying the length by the width gives the total number of these squares, which is the area.\n\nMoreover, if I were to use the formula for the area of a rectangle in terms of its sides, it's still length times width. It doesn't matter which side you consider the length or the width; the result will be the same.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the area of the garden is 432 square meters.\n\nNow, if there were any additional aspects to this problem, like finding the perimeter or something else, but based on the question, it's just asking for the area, which I've calculated.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The question is straightforward, and the calculation is simple multiplication.\n\nBut it's always good to double-check and make sure that the units are correct. In this case, both measurements are in meters, so the area is in square meters, which is appropriate.\n\nIf the measurements were in different units, I would need to convert them to the same unit before multiplying, but here, they're both in meters, so no conversion is needed.\n\nAlso, if the garden was not a perfect rectangle, but had irregular shapes, I might need to divide it into smaller sections and calculate the area of each section separately before adding them up. But again, in this case, it's a simple rectangle, so that's not necessary.\n\nFurthermore, if there were any obstacles or excluded areas within the garden, I would need to subtract those areas from the total area, but the question doesn't mention anything like that.\n\nSo, assuming the garden is a perfect rectangle with no obstructions, the area is simply length times width, which is 18m * 24m = 432 m\u00b2.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{432} \\]"
