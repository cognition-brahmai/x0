        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has a total of 60 cars, and they have two types: economy and luxury. The ratio of economy cars to luxury cars is 3:2. I need to find out how many luxury cars there are.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 3:2 means that for every 3 economy cars, there are 2 luxury cars. So, the total number of parts in the ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, since the total number of cars is 60, I can think of these 5 parts as adding up to 60 cars. So, each part must represent 60 divided by 5, which is 12 cars per part.\n\nSince luxury cars correspond to 2 parts of the ratio, I can calculate the number of luxury cars by multiplying 2 parts by 12 cars per part. That would be 2 * 12 = 24 luxury cars.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. If there are 24 luxury cars, then the number of economy cars should be 60 - 24 = 36 economy cars. Now, let's see if the ratio of 36 economy cars to 24 luxury cars is indeed 3:2.\n\nTo check the ratio, I can divide both numbers by 12, which is the greatest common divisor of 36 and 24. 36 divided by 12 is 3, and 24 divided by 12 is 2, so the ratio is indeed 3:2. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have set up an equation to solve this. Let\u2019s say the number of economy cars is 3x and the number of luxury cars is 2x, where x is a multiplier. Then, the total number of cars is 3x + 2x = 5x, and we know that 5x = 60. Solving for x, x = 60 / 5 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the number of luxury cars is 2x = 2 * 12 = 24, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. The company has 24 luxury cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
