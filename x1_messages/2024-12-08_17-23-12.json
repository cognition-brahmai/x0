        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a bag of fruit with 6 apples, 4 oranges, and 2 bananas. I need to find the probability of picking either an apple or a banana if I pick one fruit randomly without looking. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of fruits in the bag. There are 6 apples, 4 oranges, and 2 bananas. So, total fruits would be 6 + 4 + 2, which equals 12 fruits.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either an apple or a banana.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of apples plus the number of bananas, which is 6 + 2, equaling 8.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 8/12. But I can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives me 2/3.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the addition rule of probability. The addition rule says that the probability of A or B is equal to the probability of A plus the probability of B minus the probability of both A and B occurring together.\n\nIn this case, A is picking an apple, and B is picking a banana. Since you can't pick both an apple and a banana at the same time in a single pick, the probability of both A and B occurring together is zero.\n\nTherefore, P(apple or banana) = P(apple) + P(banana) - P(apple and banana) = P(apple) + P(banana) - 0 = P(apple) + P(banana).\n\nSo, P(apple) is 6/12, and P(banana) is 2/12. Adding those up gives 8/12, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nHmm, that matches what I got earlier. Good, consistent results.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability of not picking an orange, since the only other options are apples and bananas.\n\nThe number of oranges is 4, so the probability of picking an orange is 4/12, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking an orange (i.e., picking either an apple or a banana) is 1 - P(orange) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me more confidence that 2/3 is the correct probability.\n\nLet me just double-check if there's any other angle I should consider. Is there any chance that picking one type of fruit affects the probability of picking another? No, because it's a single pick, so no need to consider dependent events.\n\nAlso, since the fruits are picked randomly without looking, we can assume that each fruit has an equal chance of being picked, which seems to be the case here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of picking an apple or a banana is 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
