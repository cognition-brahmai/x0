Each plan should be followed by an evidence value which will be the output of one of the functions given an input string that can be the user question, previous evidence values or both.\n\nAvailable Tools:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows users to search for information on Bing. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from websites provided as newline delimited links. The input is one or more links and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkFinder[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nQAModel[input]: Question answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe function inputs are just plain strings without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable.\n\nOutput Format:\nPlan: [first action]\n:evidence0: = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function call and input parameter, referencing previous evidence if necessary]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?"
