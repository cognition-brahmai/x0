It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how quicksort works:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot:** Select an element from the array to act as the pivot. This can be any element, but common choices are the first, last, or middle element, or a random one.\n\n2. **Partitioning:** Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final sorted position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays:** Apply the same process to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Java.\n\n### Quicksort Implementation in Java\n\n```java\npublic class QuickSort {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] array = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};\n        quickSort(array, 0, array.length - 1);\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted array: \");\n        printArray(array);\n    }\n\n    // The main function that implements QuickSort\n    // arr[] --> Array to be sorted,\n    // low --> Starting index,\n    // high --> Ending index\n    public static void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {\n        if (low < high) {\n            // pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at right place\n            int pi = partition(arr, low, high);\n\n            // Recursively sort elements before and after partition\n            quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);\n            quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // This function takes last element as pivot, places the pivot element at its correct position in sorted array,\n    // and places all smaller (smaller than pivot) to left of pivot and all greater elements to right of pivot\n    public static int partition(int[] arr, int low, int high) {\n        int pivot = arr[high];\n        int i = (low - 1); // index of smaller element\n        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {\n            // If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot\n            if (arr[j] <= pivot) {\n                i++;\n\n                // swap arr[i] and arr[j]\n                int temp = arr[i];\n                arr[i] = arr[j];\n                arr[j] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // swap arr[i+1] and arr[high] (or pivot)\n        int temp = arr[i + 1];\n        arr[i + 1] = arr[high];\n        arr[high] = temp;\n\n        return i + 1;\n    }\n\n    // A utility function to print array of size n\n    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {\n        int n = arr.length;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n            System.out.print(arr[i] + \" \");\n        }\n        System.out.println();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Main Function:**\n   - We define the `main` method where we initialize an array and call the `quickSort` method to sort it.\n   - After sorting, we print the sorted array using the `printArray` method.\n\n2. **quickSort Method:**\n   - This is the method that implements the quicksort algorithm.\n   - It takes the array and the indices of the sub-array to be sorted.\n   - It recursively sorts the sub-arrays before and after the partition index.\n\n3. **partition Method:**\n   - This method selects the pivot (in this case, the last element of the sub-array).\n   - It rearranges the sub-array so that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left, and all greater elements are on the right.\n   - It returns the index of the pivot after partitioning.\n\n4. **printArray Method:**\n   - A utility method to print the elements of the array.\n\nThis should give you a clear understanding of how quicksort works and how to implement it in Java.
