        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. The coffee shop currently sells 150 cups of coffee each day at an average price of $4 per cup. They're thinking about increasing their sales by 25% and want to know how much additional revenue that would generate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 25% increase in sales means. If they currently sell 150 cups a day, a 25% increase would be an additional number of cups sold on top of those 150. To find out what that additional amount is, I can calculate 25% of 150.\n\nSo, 25% of 150 cups is calculated as:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 150 = 37.5\n\nSince they can't sell half a cup, maybe they'll sell an extra 38 cups, but for now, I'll keep it as 37.5 to be precise.\n\nNow, each additional cup is sold at the same average price of $4 per cup. So, the additional revenue would be the number of additional cups multiplied by the price per cup.\n\nAdditional revenue = additional cups \u00d7 price per cup\n\nAdditional revenue = 37.5 \u00d7 $4\n\nAdditional revenue = $150\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Instead of calculating the increase in cups and then multiplying by the price, perhaps I can think in terms of percentage increase in revenue directly.\n\nIf sales increase by 25%, and assuming the price per cup remains the same, then the revenue should also increase by 25%. Because revenue is equal to quantity sold multiplied by price per unit.\n\nOriginal revenue = original quantity \u00d7 price per unit\n\nNew revenue = new quantity \u00d7 price per unit\n\nSince the price per unit doesn't change, the ratio of new revenue to original revenue should be the same as the ratio of new quantity to original quantity.\n\nTherefore, if quantity increases by 25%, revenue should also increase by 25%.\n\nSo, original revenue is 150 cups \u00d7 $4 per cup = $600 per day.\n\nA 25% increase in revenue would be 25% of $600.\n\n25% of $600 is:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 600 = $150\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation. So, the additional revenue generated from a 25% increase in sales is $150 per day.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, is there a possibility that increasing sales by 25% might require reducing the price per cup, perhaps through a promotion? But according to the problem, it says they sell at an average price of $4 per cup, and there's no mention of changing the price, so I think it's safe to assume the price remains constant.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the increase is indeed in sales volume, not in something else. The problem says \"increase their sales by 25%,\" which I interpret as increasing the number of cups sold by 25%. If it were an increase in revenue by 25%, that would be different.\n\nBut based on the wording, it seems like it's the sales volume that's increasing by 25%, not the revenue. So, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem meant that revenue increases by 25%, then the additional revenue would still be $150, but in that case, the increase in sales volume would be less, because the price per cup would remain the same.\n\nWait, no, that would be circular. If revenue increases by 25%, and price stays the same, then sales volume must increase by 25% to achieve that. So, in this context, increasing sales by 25% directly translates to increasing revenue by 25%, assuming constant price per unit.\n\nTherefore, the additional revenue is indeed $150 per day.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about the total revenue before and after the increase.\n\nOriginal revenue: 150 cups \u00d7 $4 = $600\n\nIncreased sales: 150 cups + 37.5 cups = 187.5 cups\n\nTotal new revenue: 187.5 cups \u00d7 $4 = $750\n\nAdditional revenue: $750 - $600 = $150\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, using percentages:\n\nOriginal revenue: $600\n\n25% increase: 0.25 \u00d7 $600 = $150\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the coffee shop will generate an additional $150 in revenue each day if they increase their sales by 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
