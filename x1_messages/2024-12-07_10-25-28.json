        "content": "So here's this problem about handshakes in a small town. There are 20 houses on one side of the street and 30 on the other, each with 4 people. Everyone shakes hands with every person from the opposite side only once, and we need to find out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are two sides of the street: Side A with 20 houses and Side B with 30 houses. Each house has 4 people. So, the total number of people on Side A is 20 houses times 4 people per house, which is 80 people. Similarly, on Side B, it's 30 houses times 4 people per house, equaling 120 people.\n\nNow, the condition is that each person from Side A shakes hands with every person from Side B exactly once. So, essentially, it's like every person from Side A is shaking hands with all the people on Side B, but not with anyone on their own side, and vice versa.\n\nTo find the total number of handshakes, I can think of it as each person on Side A shaking hands with each person on Side B. So, for each person on Side A, there are 120 handshakes (since there are 120 people on Side B). Since there are 80 people on Side A, it would seem like the total number of handshakes is 80 times 120.\n\nLet me calculate that: 80 multiplied by 120 is... 80 times 100 is 8000, and 80 times 20 is 1600, so total 9600 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, but in handshake problems, sometimes we have to be careful not to double-count. In the classic handshake problem, where everyone shakes hands with everyone else, the formula is n(n-1)/2 because each handshake is between two people and we don't want to count it twice.\n\nBut in this case, it's a bit different because people are only shaking hands with those on the opposite side. So, there's no chance of double-counting in the same way. Each handshake is uniquely between one person from Side A and one person from Side B.\n\nSo, my initial calculation should be correct: 80 people on Side A each shaking hands with 120 people on Side B, totaling 9600 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations. The number of ways to choose one person from Side A and one person from Side B is simply the product of the number of people on each side, which is again 80 times 120, equaling 9600.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I consider the houses instead of individual people. Each house on Side A has 4 people, and each house on Side B has 4 people. So, for each house on Side A, the 4 people in it will shake hands with all 120 people on Side B.\n\nWait, but that seems similar to my initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the handshakes per house.\n\nBut no, I think my first method is the most straightforward. Each of the 80 people on Side A shakes hands with each of the 120 people on Side B, resulting in 80 * 120 = 9600 handshakes.\n\nI don't see any overlap or double-counting in this scenario, so I'm confident that 9600 is the correct total number of handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9600} \\]"
