        "content": "So there are 12 classes in the school, and each class has 25 students. To find out the total number of students in the school, I need to multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each class.\n\nSo, it's 12 classes times 25 students per class.\n\nFirst, I can break down 25 into 20 and 5 to make it easier to multiply.\n\nSo, 12 times 20 is 240, and 12 times 5 is 60.\n\nNow, I add those two results together: 240 plus 60 equals 300.\n\nTherefore, there are 300 students in the school.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to check this?\n\nMaybe I can use addition. If each class has 25 students, then adding 25 twelve times should give me the total number of students.\n\nSo, 25 plus 25 is 50, plus another 25 is 75, and so on, up to twelve 25s.\n\nBut that would take a while, and I might make a mistake in addition.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of hundreds.\n\nI know that 10 classes would have 250 students because 10 times 25 is 250.\n\nThen, two more classes would be 2 times 25, which is 50.\n\nAdding those together, 250 plus 50 equals 300.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 25 as a quarter of 100.\n\nSo, 12 classes times 25 students is the same as 12 times 25.\n\nI know that 12 times 25 is the same as 12 times 100 divided by 4.\n\n12 times 100 is 1200, and 1200 divided by 4 is 300.\n\nAgain, the same answer, 300 students.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The school has 300 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
