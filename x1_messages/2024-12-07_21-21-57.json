        "content": "The Great Wall of China was not built by a single individual or even a single dynasty. Its construction spanned over centuries and involved the labor of millions of people, including soldiers, commoners, and prisoners. The earliest walls were built during the 7th century BC by various Chinese states to protect their territories. However, the most famous sections of the wall, such as the ones near Beijing, were constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD). So, while there isn't a single person who constructed the entire Great Wall, it's the collective effort of countless individuals over many dynasties that created this magnificent structure."
