        "content": "So the factory produces 150 units per day, but has to discard 5% of them because of defects. I need to find out how many non-defective units are produced in a week, which is 7 days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are defective each day. If they produce 150 units and 5% are defective, then the number of defective units per day is 5% of 150. To calculate that, I can multiply 150 by 5% or 0.05.\n\nSo, defective units per day = 150 * 0.05 = 7.5 units.\n\nBut since we can't have half a unit, maybe it's assuming that units are divisible, or perhaps it's a theoretical problem. I'll keep it as 7.5 for now.\n\nNext, the number of non-defective units per day would be the total units produced minus the defective units.\n\nNon-defective units per day = 150 - 7.5 = 142.5 units.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production of non-defective units, I need to multiply the daily non-defective production by 7 days.\n\nWeekly non-defective units = 142.5 * 7.\n\nLet me calculate that: 142.5 * 7 = 997.5 units.\n\nAgain, we have a half unit, but perhaps in this context, it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the factory can only discard whole units, but the problem states that they discard 5% of the produced units, which in this case results in a half unit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that only whole units are produced and discarded. In that case, perhaps I should round the number of defective units to the nearest whole number before subtracting.\n\nLet me try that. Defective units per day = 150 * 0.05 = 7.5, which rounds to 8 units.\n\nThen, non-defective units per day = 150 - 8 = 142 units.\n\nWeekly non-defective units = 142 * 7 = 994 units.\n\nAlternatively, if I round down to 7 units discarded per day:\n\nNon-defective units per day = 150 - 7 = 143 units.\n\nWeekly non-defective units = 143 * 7 = 1001 units.\n\nBut rounding might not be the best approach; perhaps I should keep the calculation with decimals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the non-defective percentage directly.\n\nIf 5% are defective, then 95% are non-defective.\n\nSo, non-defective units per day = 150 * 0.95 = 142.5 units.\n\nThen, weekly non-defective units = 142.5 * 7 = 997.5 units.\n\nPerhaps the factory deals with fractions of units in their calculations, so 997.5 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory produces 150 units per day, and exactly 5% are defective, meaning that the number of defective units is exactly 7.5 per day, which might be an average based on larger or smaller time frames.\n\nIn real life, you can't have half a unit, but in this problem, it's probably acceptable to have a fractional unit.\n\nSo, the answer is 997.5 non-defective units per week.\n\nBut maybe the factory operates in such a way that defective units are only discarded at the end of the week, or perhaps the defect rate varies daily.\n\nBut based on the information given, I think calculating daily non-defective production and then multiplying by 7 is the straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total units produced in a week and then apply the defect rate to the weekly total.\n\nTotal units per week = 150 units/day * 7 days = 1050 units.\n\nDefective units per week = 5% of 1050 = 0.05 * 1050 = 52.5 units.\n\nNon-defective units per week = 1050 - 52.5 = 997.5 units.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods give me 997.5 non-defective units per week.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 997.5 units.\n\nBut perhaps the factory can only discard whole units, so they discard 52 or 53 units per week, leading to a different number of non-defective units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the defect rate is per unit, and fractions of units can be defective, so 997.5 is acceptable.\n\nI think the problem allows for fractional units in this context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{997.5} \\]"
