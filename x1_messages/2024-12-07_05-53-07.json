        "content": "Certainly! A geometric series is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a constant called the common ratio. The nth term of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ a_n = a \\cdot r^{(n-1)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( a \\) is the first term,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the common ratio,\n\n- \\( n \\) is the term number.\n\nTo implement this using recursion, we can define a function that calls itself to compute the previous terms until it reaches the base case, which is the first term.\n\nHere's how you can implement a recursive function to compute the nth term of a geometric series in Python:\n\n```python\ndef geometric_nth_term(a, r, n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return r * geometric_nth_term(a, r, n - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Base Case:** When `n` is 1, the function returns the first term `a`.\n2. **Recursive Case:** For `n` greater than 1, the function returns the common ratio `r` multiplied by the result of the function called with `n-1`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nSuppose you have a geometric series with the first term `a = 2` and common ratio `r = 3`. To find the 4th term:\n\n```python\na = 2\nr = 3\nn = 4\nprint(geometric_nth_term(a, r, n))  # Output should be 18\n```\n\nThis is because the series is 2, 6, 18, 54, ..., and the 4th term is 54.\n\n### Note:\n\n- This implementation assumes that `n` is a positive integer.\n- For large values of `n`, this recursive approach may lead to a stack overflow. In such cases, an iterative approach or tail recursion (if supported by the language) is preferable.\n\n### Iterative Alternative:\n\nFor completeness, here's an iterative version of the same function, which is more efficient for large `n`:\n\n```python\ndef geometric_nth_term_iterative(a, r, n):\n    term = a\n    for _ in range(1, n):\n        term *= r\n    return term\n```\n\nThis function iteratively multiplies the term by the common ratio `r`, `n-1` times, which is equivalent to the formula \\( a_n = a \\cdot r^{(n-1)} \\)."
