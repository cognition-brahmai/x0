        "content": "The term 'Eureka' is often attributed to the ancient Greek scholar Archimedes upon his discovery of the principle of water displacement while taking a bath. The story goes that he was tasked with determining whether a crown was made entirely of gold without damaging it. Upon entering his bath and noticing the water spilling over the sides, he realized that the volume of water displaced by an object is equal to the volume of the object itself. This led him to understand how to measure the density of the crown by comparing its weight to the volume of water it displaced, thus determining if it was made of pure gold or if silver had been substituted. Overjoyed by his discovery, he is said to have run naked through the streets shouting \"Eureka!\" which translates to \"I have found it!\" in English."
