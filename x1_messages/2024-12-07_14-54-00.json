        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here: flipping three coins and trying to find out the chance that exactly two of them come up heads. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when flipping three coins. Each coin has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). So, for three coins, the total number of possible outcomes should be 2^3, which is 8. Let me list them out to make sure:\n\n1. HHH\n\n2. HHT\n\n3. HTH\n\n4. HTT\n\n5. THH\n\n6. THT\n\n7. TTH\n\n8. TTT\n\nOkay, that's 8 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these outcomes have exactly two heads. Let's look at the list:\n\n1. HHH - that's three heads, not two.\n\n2. HHT - that's two heads and one tail.\n\n3. HTH - that's also two heads and one tail.\n\n4. HTT - that's one head and two tails.\n\n5. THH - two heads and one tail.\n\n6. THT - one head and two tails.\n\n7. TTH - one head and two tails.\n\n8. TTT - no heads.\n\nSo, from the list, the outcomes with exactly two heads are HHT, HTH, and THH. That's three outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 3/8.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using combinations? Because order shouldn't matter here, right? I just need to know how many ways to choose 2 heads out of 3 coins.\n\nYes, combinations are useful here. The number of ways to choose 2 heads out of 3 coins is denoted as \"3 choose 2,\" which is written as C(3,2). The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nSo, C(3,2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = (6) / (2 * 1) = 6/2 = 3.\n\nOkay, that matches what I found earlier: 3 favorable outcomes.\n\nNow, the total number of possible outcomes is 8, as we listed.\n\nSo, the probability is C(3,2) / total outcomes = 3/8.\n\nIs there a general formula for this kind of problem? I think so. For n coins and k heads, the probability is C(n,k) / 2^n.\n\nIn this case, n=3, k=2, so P = C(3,2) / 2^3 = 3/8.\n\nAlright, that makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using probability rules.\n\nThe probability of getting heads on a single coin flip is 1/2, and the same for tails.\n\nFor exactly two heads in three flips, we can think of it as:\n\n- The probability of getting heads on the first two coins and tails on the third: (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8.\n\n- But that's just one specific sequence. There are other sequences where exactly two coins are heads: HHT, HTH, THH.\n\nSo, we need to account for all these sequences.\n\nEach of these sequences has a probability of (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nSince there are three such sequences, the total probability is 3*(1/8) = 3/8.\n\nAgain, that matches what I found earlier.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using binomial probability.\n\nYes, this is a binomial probability problem because there are independent trials (coin flips), each with two possible outcomes (heads or tails), and we're interested in the number of successes (heads).\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the number of trials (3 coin flips),\n\n- k is the number of successes (2 heads),\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (1/2 for heads),\n\n- C(n,k) is the combination formula.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(2) = C(3,2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^(3-2) = 3 * (1/4) * (1/2) = 3 * (1/8) = 3/8.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nSo, no matter which approach I take, I keep getting 3/8 as the probability.\n\nMaybe I can also think about it in terms of conditional probability.\n\nFor example, the probability that the first two coins are heads and the third is tails, or the first and third are heads and the second is tails, etc.\n\nBut that seems more complicated and likely to lead to mistakes, especially since the other methods are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, could I use the complement to find this probability?\n\nThe complement of exactly two heads would be all outcomes that are not exactly two heads, which includes zero heads, one head, or three heads.\n\nBut calculating the complement might be more work in this case, since I'd have to find the probabilities of zero, one, and three heads, and then subtract that sum from 1.\n\nWait, let's try it.\n\nProbability of zero heads: C(3,0) / 8 = 1/8.\n\nProbability of one head: C(3,1) / 8 = 3/8.\n\nProbability of three heads: C(3,3) / 8 = 1/8.\n\nSo, the probability of not exactly two heads is 1/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 = 5/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability of exactly two heads is 1 - 5/8 = 3/8.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that 3/8 is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any possibility that order matters here? For example, does the sequence in which the heads and tails appear affect the probability?\n\nIn the way I've approached it, order doesn't matter because I'm considering combinations, not permutations.\n\nBut in reality, each specific sequence is equally likely, and I'm counting all the sequences with exactly two heads.\n\nSo, I think I've covered all the bases here.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's imagine flipping the coins one by one.\n\nFirst flip: H or T, each with probability 1/2.\n\nSecond flip: H or T, each with probability 1/2.\n\nThird flip: H or T, each with probability 1/2.\n\nNow, the outcomes where exactly two are heads:\n\n1. First two heads, third tail: H, H, T \u2192 probability (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8.\n\n2. First and third heads, second tail: H, T, H \u2192 probability 1/8.\n\n3. Second and third heads, first tail: T, H, H \u2192 probability 1/8.\n\nAdding these up: 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/8.\n\nSame answer yet again.\n\nI think it's clear that the probability is 3/8.\n\nBut wait, I recall that in some probability problems, coins might be biased, meaning the probability of heads isn't necessarily 1/2.\n\nHowever, in this problem, it's flipping regular coins, so I can assume they're fair, with P(H) = P(T) = 1/2.\n\nIf the coins were biased, say P(H) = p and P(T) = 1 - p, then the formula would be P(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k).\n\nBut since p = 1/2 here, it simplifies to what I've already calculated.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider?\n\nMaybe using generating functions.\n\nGenerating functions can be used to solve probability problems involving independent events.\n\nFor coin flips, the generating function for a single coin is (1/2)X + (1/2), where X represents heads.\n\nFor three coins, the generating function would be [(1/2)X + (1/2)]^3.\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n(1/8)X^3 + (3/8)X^2 + (3/8)X + (1/8).\n\nThe coefficient of X^2 represents the probability of getting exactly two heads, which is 3/8.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis is getting redundant, but it's reassuring that no matter which method I use, I get 3/8.\n\nPerhaps I'm overthinking this, but I want to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nLet me consider if there's any difference between identical and distinct coins.\n\nIn probability problems, even if the coins are identical, we consider the outcomes as distinct sequences because the flips are independent events.\n\nSo, treating the coins as distinct is appropriate.\n\nMoreover, since the coins are indistinguishable, some might argue that the order doesn't matter.\n\nBut in probability calculations, it's standard to consider the sample space with equally likely outcomes, which in this case are the 8 possible sequences.\n\nIf we were to consider only the number of heads, then the sample space would be {0, 1, 2, 3} heads, with different probabilities for each.\n\nBut for clarity, it's better to stick with the sequence outcomes.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach is correct.\n\nJust to cover all possibilities, let's think about it in terms of binary sequences.\n\nEach coin flip can be represented as a binary digit: 0 for tails, 1 for heads.\n\nSo, flipping three coins is like generating a 3-digit binary number from 000 to 111.\n\nThe total number of possible binary numbers is 2^3 = 8, which matches our sample space.\n\nNow, the numbers with exactly two 1's are 011, 101, and 110, which correspond to HHT, HTH, and THH.\n\nAgain, three favorable outcomes out of eight.\n\nProbability is 3/8.\n\nAlright, I think I've beaten this problem to death.\n\nFrom every angle I look at it, the probability is 3/8.\n\nI can confidently say that the answer is 3/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}} \\]"
