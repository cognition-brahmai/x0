        "content": "Let's see. There are three candidates in this election: A, B, and C. Candidate A got 45% of the votes, candidate B got 35%, and candidate C got the remaining votes. The total number of votes cast is 20,000. I need to find out how many votes candidate C received.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what percentage of the votes candidate C received. Since the total percentage has to add up to 100%, I can subtract the percentages of candidates A and B from 100% to find C's percentage.\n\nSo, percentage for C = 100% - 45% - 35% = 20%.\n\nAlright, candidate C received 20% of the votes. Now, to find out how many votes that is, I need to calculate 20% of 20,000.\n\nI know that 1% of 20,000 is 200 because 20,000 divided by 100 is 200.\n\nSo, 20% would be 20 times 200, which is 4,000.\n\nTherefore, candidate C received 4,000 votes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If A has 45%, B has 35%, and C has 20%, that adds up to 100%, which is good.\n\nAnd 20% of 20,000 is indeed 4,000.\n\nYeah, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000} \\]"
