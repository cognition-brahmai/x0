        "content": "So, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a tree that produces 12 apples in the first year, and each year after that, it doubles its production from the previous year. We need to find out how many apples it produces in total over 5 years.\n\nFirst, let's list out the production for each year:\n\n- Year 1: 12 apples\n\nSince it doubles each year,:\n\n- Year 2: 12 * 2 = 24 apples\n\n- Year 3: 24 * 2 = 48 apples\n\n- Year 4: 48 * 2 = 96 apples\n\n- Year 5: 96 * 2 = 192 apples\n\nNow, to find the total production over 5 years, we just need to add up the apples from each year:\n\nTotal = Year 1 + Year 2 + Year 3 + Year 4 + Year 5\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal = 12 + 24 + 48 + 96 + 192\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\n12 + 24 = 36\n\n36 + 48 = 84\n\n84 + 96 = 180\n\n180 + 192 = 372\n\nSo, the total number of apples produced over 5 years is 372.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nYear 1: 12\n\nYear 2: 12 * 2 = 24\n\nYear 3: 24 * 2 = 48\n\nYear 4: 48 * 2 = 96\n\nYear 5: 96 * 2 = 192\n\nAdding them up:\n\n12 + 24 = 36\n\n36 + 48 = 84\n\n84 + 96 = 180\n\n180 + 192 = 372\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I know that this is a geometric series, where each term is double the previous one. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:\n\nS_n = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S_n is the sum of the first n terms\n\n- a is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this case:\n\n- a = 12\n\n- r = 2\n\n- n = 5\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nS_5 = 12 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1)\n\nFirst, calculate 2^5:\n\n2^5 = 32\n\nThen, 32 - 1 = 31\n\nDenominator is 2 - 1 = 1\n\nSo, S_5 = 12 * 31 / 1 = 12 * 31 = 372\n\nPerfect, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using recursion or some other method.\n\nSuppose we think recursively: the total production up to year n is the sum of the production up to year n-1 plus the production in year n.\n\nSo, Total(5) = Total(4) + Year5\n\nTotal(4) = Total(3) + Year4\n\nAnd so on, until Total(1) = Year1\n\nBut that seems more complicated than necessary since the geometric series formula gives us the answer directly.\n\nAnother way is to see that each year's production is a multiple of the first year's production by a factor of 2^(n-1).\n\nSo, Year n = 12 * 2^(n-1)\n\nTherefore, the total over 5 years is:\n\nTotal = 12 * 2^(1-1) + 12 * 2^(2-1) + 12 * 2^(3-1) + 12 * 2^(4-1) + 12 * 2^(5-1)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nTotal = 12 * 1 + 12 * 2 + 12 * 4 + 12 * 8 + 12 * 16\n\nWhich is:\n\nTotal = 12 + 24 + 48 + 96 + 192 = 372\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear that the total number of apples produced over 5 years is 372.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{372} \\]"
