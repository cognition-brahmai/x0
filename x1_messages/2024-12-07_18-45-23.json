        "content": "So I've got this matrix A, which is [[4, 2], [1, 3]], and I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I remember that eigenvalues are scalars that don't change the direction of a vector when the matrix is applied to it, and eigenvectors are those vectors that only get scaled by the matrix.\n\nFirst, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation, which is det(A - \u03bbI) = 0, where \u03bb represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nSo, let's write down A - \u03bbI:\n\nA - \u03bbI = [[4 - \u03bb, 2], [1, 3 - \u03bb]]\n\nNow, I need to find the determinant of this matrix and set it equal to zero:\n\ndet(A - \u03bbI) = (4 - \u03bb)(3 - \u03bb) - (2)(1) = 0\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n(4 - \u03bb)(3 - \u03bb) - 2 = 0\n\nFirst, multiply (4 - \u03bb) and (3 - \u03bb):\n\n4*3 = 12\n\n4*(-\u03bb) = -4\u03bb\n\n(-\u03bb)*3 = -3\u03bb\n\n(-\u03bb)*(-\u03bb) = \u03bb\u00b2\n\nSo, (4 - \u03bb)(3 - \u03bb) = 12 - 4\u03bb - 3\u03bb + \u03bb\u00b2 = \u03bb\u00b2 - 7\u03bb + 12\n\nNow, subtract 2:\n\n\u03bb\u00b2 - 7\u03bb + 12 - 2 = \u03bb\u00b2 - 7\u03bb + 10\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n\u03bb\u00b2 - 7\u03bb + 10 = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for \u03bb. I can factor it:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 10 and add up to -7. Those numbers are -2 and -5.\n\nSo, (\u03bb - 2)(\u03bb - 5) = 0\n\nTherefore, \u03bb = 2 or \u03bb = 5\n\nThese are the eigenvalues.\n\nNow, for each eigenvalue, I need to find the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nLet's start with \u03bb = 2.\n\nTo find the eigenvectors for \u03bb = 2, I need to solve the equation (A - \u03bbI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nSo, A - 2I = [[4 - 2, 2], [1, 3 - 2]] = [[2, 2], [1, 1]]\n\nNow, set up the equation:\n\n[[2, 2], [1, 1]] * [x, y] = [0, 0]\n\nThis gives us the system of equations:\n\n2x + 2y = 0\n\n1x + 1y = 0\n\nBoth equations are essentially the same: x + y = 0\n\nSo, y = -x\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb = 2 are all vectors of the form [x, -x], where x is any scalar.\n\nWe can write this as x*[1, -1], where x is a scalar.\n\nSo, an eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = 2 is [1, -1].\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb = 5.\n\nFirst, compute A - 5I:\n\nA - 5I = [[4 - 5, 2], [1, 3 - 5]] = [[-1, 2], [1, -2]]\n\nNow, set up the equation:\n\n[[-1, 2], [1, -2]] * [x, y] = [0, 0]\n\nThis gives us:\n\n-1x + 2y = 0\n\n1x - 2y = 0\n\nBoth equations are multiples of each other, so we can use one of them: -x + 2y = 0\n\nWhich implies x = 2y\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb = 5 are all vectors of the form [2y, y], where y is any scalar.\n\nWe can write this as y*[2, 1], where y is a scalar.\n\nSo, an eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = 5 is [2, 1]\n\nTo summarize:\n\nEigenvalue \u03bb = 2 has eigenvectors of the form [1, -1]\n\nEigenvalue \u03bb = 5 has eigenvectors of the form [2, 1]\n\nI should probably verify these to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's check for \u03bb = 2:\n\nA * [1, -1] = [[4, 2], [1, 3]] * [1, -1] = [4*1 + 2*(-1), 1*1 + 3*(-1)] = [4 - 2, 1 - 3] = [2, -2]\n\nWhich is equal to 2 * [1, -1] = [2, -2]\n\nSo, yes, that checks out.\n\nNow, for \u03bb = 5:\n\nA * [2, 1] = [[4, 2], [1, 3]] * [2, 1] = [4*2 + 2*1, 1*2 + 3*1] = [8 + 2, 2 + 3] = [10, 5]\n\nWhich is equal to 5 * [2, 1] = [10, 5]\n\nPerfect, that checks out too.\n\nI think that's it. I've found the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors, and verified them.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda = 2 \\) and \\( \\lambda = 5 \\). The eigenvector corresponding to \\( \\lambda = 2 \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), and the eigenvector corresponding to \\( \\lambda = 5 \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)."
