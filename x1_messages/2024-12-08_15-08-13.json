        "content": "Let's see. The train goes from Town A to Town B, which is 120 miles apart, and it travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. So, first, I need to figure out how long it takes to cover that distance without any stops.\n\nTime is equal to distance divided by speed, right? So, time = 120 miles / 60 mph. That should be 2 hours. But wait, there's a catch here. The train stops halfway for 30 minutes due to a technical issue.\n\nHalfway means it stops after covering half the distance. Half of 120 miles is 60 miles. So, it travels 60 miles at 60 mph, which should take 1 hour, then stops for 30 minutes, and then continues the remaining 60 miles at 60 mph, which is another 1 hour.\n\nSo, total travel time would be the time to the stop plus the stop time plus the time after the stop. That's 1 hour + 0.5 hours + 1 hour, which adds up to 2.5 hours.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the train travels at 60 mph for 60 miles, that's indeed 1 hour. Then it stops for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. Then it travels another 60 miles at 60 mph, another 1 hour. So, 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 2.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the total time is the sum of the travel times plus the stop time. Travel time is 120 miles / 60 mph = 2 hours, plus 0.5 hours stop, totaling 2.5 hours.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the total travel time is 2.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
