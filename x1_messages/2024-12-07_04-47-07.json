Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It helps in locating suitable sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and generates plain text output containing the content of the links.\nUrlExtractor[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of URLs.\nALM[input]: An advanced language model for answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input should be a text question that refers to a :doc[n]: variable, e.g., How tall is the Eiffel Tower, given :doc1:?\n\nEach function's input should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with a doc variable, e.g., ALM[Who is the author of War and Peace, given :doc3:?]\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in this format:\nPlan: [First action to take based on the input question]\n:doc0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action to take, based on the result of :doc0:]\n:doc1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :doc0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:doc[n]: Containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the director of the movie Inception and what other movies has he directed?"
