        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has 120 apple trees, and each tree produces an average of 400 apples per season. So, first, I need to find out how many apples there are in total.\n\nTotal apples = number of trees \u00d7 apples per tree\nTotal apples = 120 \u00d7 400\nTotal apples = 48,000\n\nNow, the farmer sells each apple for $0.50. To find the total revenue, I need to multiply the total number of apples by the price per apple.\n\nTotal revenue = total apples \u00d7 price per apple\nTotal revenue = 48,000 \u00d7 0.50\nTotal revenue = $24,000\n\nSo, the total revenue generated from all the apples is $24,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24000} \\]"
