        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 4 meters and a height of 6 meters, and I need to find out its volume. Okay, volume of a cylinder, I think I remember that from geometry. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V equals pi times the radius squared times the height. That is, V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the radius. The problem gives me the diameter, which is 4 meters. Remember, the radius is half of the diameter, so r = d/2. Therefore, r = 4 meters / 2 = 2 meters.\n\nNow, I have the radius (r = 2 meters) and the height (h = 6 meters). I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0 * (2 meters)\u00b2 * 6 meters.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step. First, square the radius: (2 meters)\u00b2 = 4 square meters.\n\nThen, multiply that by pi: 4 square meters * \u03c0 = 4\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\nFinally, multiply by the height: 4\u03c0 cubic meters * 6 meters = 24\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\nNow, pi (\u03c0) is approximately 3.14159, so I can calculate the numerical value if needed.\n\n24 * 3.14159 = approximately 75.39822 cubic meters.\n\nBut since the problem gives measurements in meters and doesn't specify to round or use an approximation for pi, I can leave the answer in terms of pi.\n\nSo, the volume is 24\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that I have the correct formula. Yes, for a cylinder, volume is indeed \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nAlso, confirm the radius: diameter is 4 meters, so radius is 2 meters. That seems right.\n\nCalculations: 2 squared is 4, times 6 is 24, so 24\u03c0 cubic meters. That sounds correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate it numerically, it's approximately 75.4 cubic meters, but leaving it in terms of pi is more precise and acceptable.\n\nSo, the volume of the tank is 24\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24\\pi} \\]"
