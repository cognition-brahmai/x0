        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So total, there are 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 balls in the bag. The problem is asking for the probability that if I draw two balls at random without replacement, both of them will be green.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the basic formula for probability, which is:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are the scenarios where both balls drawn are green, and the total possible outcomes are all possible pairs of balls that can be drawn from the bag.\n\nSince we're drawing without replacement, the first and second draws are dependent events, meaning the outcome of the first draw affects the second draw.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total number of possible outcomes when drawing two balls from 12 without replacement. That's simply the number of combinations of 12 balls taken 2 at a time.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 66\n\nSo, there are 66 possible pairs of balls that can be drawn.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the pairs where both balls are green. There are 5 green balls in the bag.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 green balls from 5 is C(5, 2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 favorable pairs of green balls.\n\nNow, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 10 / 66. That simplifies to 5 / 33.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities directly without combinations.\n\nLet's see. The probability that the first ball drawn is green is the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/12.\n\nThen, since we're drawing without replacement, the probability that the second ball is also green, given that the first one was green, is 4/11, because there are now 4 green balls left out of 11 total balls.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I multiply the probabilities:\n\n(5/12) \u00d7 (4/11) = 20 / 132 = 5 / 33\n\nSo, I get the same answer both ways. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem to ensure I haven't missed anything?\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of permutations. Instead of combinations, I could consider the order in which the balls are drawn.\n\nIf I consider the order, the total number of possible outcomes when drawing two balls without replacement is 12 \u00d7 11 = 132.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes where both balls are green would be 5 \u00d7 4 = 20.\n\nSo, the probability would be 20 / 132, which simplifies to 5 / 33 again.\n\nHmm, interesting. So no matter which approach I take, I end up with the same probability.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability that both balls drawn are green is 5/33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]"
