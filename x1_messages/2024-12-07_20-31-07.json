        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from City A to City B at 80 km/h and comes back at 120 km/h. We need to find the average speed for the whole journey.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find out the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between City A and City B is \\( d \\) kilometers. That means the total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\) kilometers.\n\nNow, for the trip from City A to City B at 80 km/h, the time taken would be \\( \\frac{d}{80} \\) hours. For the return trip from City B to City A at 120 km/h, the time taken would be \\( \\frac{d}{120} \\) hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is \\( \\frac{d}{80} + \\frac{d}{120} \\) hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 80 and 120 is 240. So, let's convert the fractions:\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{80} = \\frac{3d}{240} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{120} = \\frac{2d}{240} \\)\n\nAdding them up: \\( \\frac{3d}{240} + \\frac{2d}{240} = \\frac{5d}{240} = \\frac{d}{48} \\) hours.\n\nNow, the total distance is \\( 2d \\) kilometers, and the total time is \\( \\frac{d}{48} \\) hours.\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time = \\( \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{48}} = 2d \\times \\frac{48}{d} = 96 \\) km/h.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a formula for average speed when the distances are equal but speeds are different. It's the harmonic mean, I think. The formula is:\n\nAverage speed = \\( \\frac{2 \\times \\text{speed}_1 \\times \\text{speed}_2}{\\text{speed}_1 + \\text{speed}_2} \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\( \\frac{2 \\times 80 \\times 120}{80 + 120} = \\frac{2 \\times 9600}{200} = \\frac{19200}{200} = 96 \\) km/h.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is 96 km/h.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider an example with actual distances. Suppose the distance between City A and City B is 240 kilometers.\n\nThen, the total distance for the round trip is 480 kilometers.\n\nTime going from A to B: \\( \\frac{240}{80} = 3 \\) hours.\n\nTime returning from B to A: \\( \\frac{240}{120} = 2 \\) hours.\n\nTotal time: 3 + 2 = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed: \\( \\frac{480}{5} = 96 \\) km/h.\n\nAlright, it consistent with the previous calculations.\n\nI think the answer is 96 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
