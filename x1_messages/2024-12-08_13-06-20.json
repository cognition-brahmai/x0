        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in the class, and each student plays either soccer or basketball, but not both. So, the total number of students is the sum of those who play soccer and those who play basketball.\n\nLet me denote the number of students who play soccer as S and the number who play basketball as B. So, S + B = 30.\n\nThe problem also says that twice the number of students who play soccer is equal to thrice the number of students who play basketball. That translates to 2S = 3B.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. S + B = 30\n\n2. 2S = 3B\n\nI need to solve these equations to find the value of S.\n\nLet me solve the second equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for S in terms of B.\n\n2S = 3B => S = (3/2)B\n\nNow, substitute this expression for S into the first equation:\n\n(3/2)B + B = 30\n\nTo combine the terms, I need a common denominator, which is 2.\n\n(3/2)B + (2/2)B = 30\n\n(5/2)B = 30\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 2/5 to solve for B:\n\nB = 30 * (2/5) = 12\n\nSo, 12 students play basketball.\n\nNow, substitute B back into the expression for S:\n\nS = (3/2)*12 = 18\n\nTherefore, 18 students play soccer.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal students: 18 (soccer) + 12 (basketball) = 30, which matches.\n\nAlso, twice the number of soccer players is 2*18=36, and thrice the number of basketball players is 3*12=36, which are equal as per the problem.\n\nLooks good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
