        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a store that sells four different types of items, each with their own selling prices, and I need to find out the total revenue for a day based on how many of each item they sold. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are four items: X, Y, Z, and W, with selling prices of $12, $15, $20, and $25 respectively. Then, the store sold 30 units of X, 40 units of Y, 50 units of Z, and 60 units of W in one day. To find the total revenue, I need to calculate the revenue from each item separately and then add them all up.\n\nLet me start with Item X. It's sold at $12 per unit, and they sold 30 units. So, the revenue from X would be 30 times $12. Let me do that calculation: 30 multiplied by 12 is 360. So, $360 from Item X.\n\nNext, Item Y is sold at $15 per unit, and they sold 40 units. So, revenue from Y is 40 times $15. That's 40 multiplied by 15, which is 600. So, $600 from Item Y.\n\nNow, Item Z costs $20 per unit, and they sold 50 units. Revenue from Z is 50 times $20. 50 multiplied by 20 is 1000. So, $1000 from Item Z.\n\nLastly, Item W is sold at $25 per unit, and they sold 60 units. Revenue from W is 60 times $25. 60 multiplied by 25 is 1500. So, $1500 from Item W.\n\nNow, to find the total revenue for the day, I need to add up all these amounts: $360 from X, $600 from Y, $1000 from Z, and $1500 from W.\n\nLet's add them step by step. First, 360 plus 600 is 960. Then, 960 plus 1000 is 1960. Finally, 1960 plus 1500 is 3460.\n\nSo, the total revenue generated that day is $3460.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the individual revenues:\n\n- X: 30 units at $12 each: 30 * 12 = 360\n\n- Y: 40 units at $15 each: 40 * 15 = 600\n\n- Z: 50 units at $20 each: 50 * 20 = 1000\n\n- W: 60 units at $25 each: 60 * 25 = 1500\n\nAdding them up: 360 + 600 = 960, then 960 + 1000 = 1960, and finally 1960 + 1500 = 3460.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The total revenue for the day is $3460.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3460} \\]"
