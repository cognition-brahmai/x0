        "content": "So the company is producing 12,000 units of a product every week, and each unit takes 3 hours of labor to make. We need to figure out how many full-time employees, who work 40 hours per week, are required to meet this production target.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total labor hours needed for the weekly production. Since each unit requires 3 hours of labor, and there are 12,000 units produced each week, the total labor hours required per week would be:\n\nTotal labor hours = Number of units \u00d7 Hours per unit\nTotal labor hours = 12,000 units \u00d7 3 hours/unit\nTotal labor hours = 36,000 hours\n\nNow, each full-time employee works 40 hours per week. To find out how many full-time employees are needed to cover the 36,000 hours of labor, I can divide the total labor hours by the number of hours one employee works per week:\n\nNumber of employees = Total labor hours \u00f7 Hours per employee per week\nNumber of employees = 36,000 hours \u00f7 40 hours/employee/week\nNumber of employees = 900 employees\n\nSo, the company needs 900 full-time employees to meet the production target of 12,000 units per week, given that each unit requires 3 hours of labor and each employee works 40 hours per week.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there anything else I should consider here? For example, are there any overhead tasks, breaks, or inefficiencies that might require additional labor? The question seems straightforward, but in real-life scenarios, there might be factors like machine downtime, training time, or other non-production tasks that employees have to handle.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, the calculation seems clear and straightforward. The company needs 900 full-time employees to produce 12,000 units per week, with each unit requiring 3 hours of labor and each employee working 40 hours per week.\n\nLet me just double-check my math to be sure:\n\n12,000 units \u00d7 3 hours/unit = 36,000 hours\n\n36,000 hours \u00f7 40 hours/employee/week = 900 employees\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
