Alice and Bob are two villagers, and Alice makes a statement: \"At least one of us is a liar.\" I need to figure out if Bob is a liar based on this statement.\n\nFirst, I should consider what Alice's statement means. \"At least one of us is a liar\" can be interpreted in a few ways. Let's think about the possible scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Alice is a truth-teller.\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, then her statement must be true. So, if she says \"At least one of us is a liar,\" that means that at least one between Alice and Bob is a liar. But wait, Alice is a truth-teller, so the only way for at least one of them to be a liar is if Bob is a liar.\n\nSo, in this case, if Alice is a truth-teller, then Bob must be a liar.\n\nScenario 2: Alice is a liar.\n\nIf Alice is a liar, then her statement must be false. So, the statement \"At least one of us is a liar\" is false. That would mean that neither Alice nor Bob is a liar. But wait, if Alice is a liar, then that contradicts the conclusion that neither is a liar because Alice would be a liar.\n\nThis seems contradictory. So, if Alice is a liar, her statement is false, which implies that neither of them is a liar, but that can't be right because that would make Alice a truth-teller, which contradicts our assumption that she is a liar.\n\nTherefore, this scenario leads to a contradiction.\n\nGiven these two scenarios, only the first scenario makes sense without leading to a contradiction. Therefore, Alice must be a truth-teller, and Bob must be a liar.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this.\n\nIf Alice is a truth-teller, and she says \"At least one of us is a liar,\" then indeed, Bob must be the liar.\n\nIf Alice is a liar, and she says \"At least one of us is a liar,\" then this statement is false, meaning that neither of them is a liar. But that can't be, because if Alice is a liar, then she is a liar, which contradicts the conclusion that neither is a liar.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Alice is a truth-teller and Bob is a liar.\n\nSo, the answer is yes, Bob is a liar.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, Bob is a liar.}} \\]"
