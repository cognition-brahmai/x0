        "content": "So in this class, there are 40 students in total. And it's said that 70% of them received an A on their final exam. I need to find out how many students did not receive an A.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many students got an A. Since 70% of the class received an A, I can calculate that by taking 70% of 40.\n\nTo calculate 70% of 40, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the total number of students. So, 70% is 0.70 in decimal form. So, 0.70 times 40 is:\n\n0.70 \u00d7 40 = 28\n\nSo, 28 students received an A.\n\nNow, to find out how many did not receive an A, I can subtract the number of students who got an A from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nStudents who got an A = 28\n\nStudents who did not get an A = 40 - 28 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 students did not receive an A.\n\nBut let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that if 70% received an A, then the remaining percentage did not receive an A. So, 100% - 70% = 30% did not receive an A.\n\nNow, to find 30% of 40, I can again convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply by the total number of students.\n\n30% is 0.30 in decimal form.\n\n0.30 \u00d7 40 = 12\n\nSo, again, I get 12 students did not receive an A.\n\nAlternatively, I could use fractions to calculate this.\n\n70% is equivalent to 70/100, which simplifies to 7/10.\n\nSo, 7/10 of 40 is:\n\n(7/10) \u00d7 40 = (7 \u00d7 40) / 10 = 280 / 10 = 28\n\nAgain, 28 students received an A.\n\nThen, 40 - 28 = 12 did not receive an A.\n\nAlternatively, for the students who did not receive an A, it's 30%, which is 30/100 or 3/10.\n\nSo, 3/10 of 40 is:\n\n(3/10) \u00d7 40 = (3 \u00d7 40) / 10 = 120 / 10 = 12\n\nOnce more, I get 12 students.\n\nI think it's clear that 12 students did not receive an A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 70% received an A, then for every 100 students, 70 would receive an A.\n\nBut in this case, there are only 40 students.\n\nSo, I can set up a proportion:\n\n70% is to 100 students as x is to 40 students.\n\nBut that's essentially what I did earlier, calculating 70% of 40.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nPercentage of students who did not receive an A is 30%.\n\nSo, in a class of 40, 30% did not receive an A.\n\nWhich again is 0.30 \u00d7 40 = 12.\n\nI feel confident now that the answer is 12 students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
