        "content": "Alright, I'll guide you through creating a Python script that connects to a MySQL database, retrieves data from an \"employees\" table, and generates a report showing the total salary paid per department. Make sure you have MySQL installed and a database set up with the \"employees\" table containing the columns \"id\", \"name\", \"salary\", and \"department\".\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the necessary Python library to connect to MySQL. You can use `mysql-connector-python`. Install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install mysql-connector-python\n```\n\nNow, let's write the Python script step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Connect to the MySQL Database\n\nYou need to establish a connection to your MySQL database. You'll need the host name, user name, password, and database name.\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\n\n# Database connection parameters\nconfig = {\n    'user': 'your_username',\n    'password': 'your_password',\n    'host': '127.0.0.1',\n    'database': 'your_database_name',\n    'raise_on_warnings': True\n}\n\n# Establishing the connection\ntry:\n    cnx = mysql.connector.connect(**config)\n    print(\"Connection established\")\nexcept mysql.connector.Error as err:\n    print(f\"Error connecting to database: {err}\")\n    exit(1)\n```\n\nReplace `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and `'your_database_name'` with your actual database credentials.\n\n### Step 2: Retrieve Data from the \"employees\" Table\n\nOnce connected, you can retrieve data from the \"employees\" table.\n\n```python\n# Creating a cursor object using the connection\ncursor = cnx.cursor()\n\n# Query to retrieve data\nquery = (\"SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department\")\n\ntry:\n    cursor.execute(query)\n    print(\"Data retrieved successfully\")\nexcept mysql.connector.Error as err:\n    print(f\"Error retrieving data: {err}\")\n    cursor.close()\n    cnx.close()\n    exit(1)\n```\n\nThis query calculates the total salary paid per department using the `SUM` function and groups the results by department.\n\n### Step 3: Generate the Report\n\nFetch the results from the cursor and print them in a formatted manner.\n\n```python\n# Fetching all rows from the executed query\ndepartments = cursor.fetchall()\n\n# Printing the report\nprint(\"\\nDepartment-wise Total Salary Report:\")\nprint(\"{:<15} {:<15}\".format('Department', 'Total Salary'))\nfor department in departments:\n    print(\"{:<15} {:<15}\".format(department[0], department[1]))\n```\n\nThis will display a simple text-based report showing each department and the total salary paid in that department.\n\n### Step 4: Close the Connection\n\nDon't forget to close the cursor and the connection to clean up.\n\n```python\n# Closing the cursor and connection\ncursor.close()\ncnx.close()\nprint(\"\\nConnection closed\")\n```\n\n### Complete Script\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete Python script:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\n\n# Database connection parameters\nconfig = {\n    'user': 'your_username',\n    'password': 'your_password',\n    'host': '127.0.0.1',\n    'database': 'your_database_name',\n    'raise_on_warnings': True\n}\n\ntry:\n    cnx = mysql.connector.connect(**config)\n    print(\"Connection established\")\nexcept mysql.connector.Error as err:\n    print(f\"Error connecting to database: {err}\")\n    exit(1)\n\ncursor = cnx.cursor()\n\nquery = (\"SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department\")\n\ntry:\n    cursor.execute(query)\n    print(\"Data retrieved successfully\")\nexcept mysql.connector.Error as err:\n    print(f\"Error retrieving data: {err}\")\n    cursor.close()\n    cnx.close()\n    exit(1)\n\ndepartments = cursor.fetchall()\n\nprint(\"\\nDepartment-wise Total Salary Report:\")\nprint(\"{:<15} {:<15}\".format('Department', 'Total Salary'))\nfor department in departments:\n    print(\"{:<15} {:<15}\".format(department[0], department[1]))\n\ncursor.close()\ncnx.close()\nprint(\"\\nConnection closed\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Connection Setup:** Establishes a connection to the MySQL database using provided credentials.\n2. **Data Retrieval:** Executes a SQL query to calculate the total salary per department.\n3. **Report Generation:** Fetches and prints the results in a formatted table.\n4. **Cleanup:** Closes the database connection and cursor to free up resources.\n\nThis script provides a basic report of total salaries paid per department. You can extend it further by adding more functionalities, such as exporting the report to a file or handling more complex queries."
