        "content": "So I've got this problem here about finding the area of a rectangle. The length is given as 3x - 4 and the width as x + 2. I need to find the area when x equals 5. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the area of a rectangle. I know that area is equal to length multiplied by width. So, area = length \u00d7 width.\n\nGiven that, the length is 3x - 4 and the width is x + 2. So, the area should be (3x - 4) multiplied by (x + 2).\n\nBut wait, I need to find the area when x is 5. So, maybe I can substitute x = 5 into the expressions for length and width first, and then multiply them.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, find the length when x = 5:\n\nLength = 3x - 4\n\nPlug in x = 5:\n\nLength = 3(5) - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.\n\nOkay, so the length is 11 units.\n\nNext, find the width when x = 5:\n\nWidth = x + 2\n\nPlug in x = 5:\n\nWidth = 5 + 2 = 7.\n\nSo, the width is 7 units.\n\nNow, area = length \u00d7 width = 11 \u00d7 7.\n\nLet me calculate that: 11 times 7 is 77.\n\nSo, the area is 77 square units.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I could multiply the expressions for length and width first, and then substitute x = 5.\n\nLet me try that to see if I get the same answer.\n\nSo, area = (3x - 4)(x + 2)\n\nI need to expand this expression.\n\nUsing the distributive property, or FOIL method:\n\nFirst: 3x \u00d7 x = 3x\u00b2\n\nOuter: 3x \u00d7 2 = 6x\n\nInner: -4 \u00d7 x = -4x\n\nLast: -4 \u00d7 2 = -8\n\nNow, combine all those terms:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 6x - 4x - 8\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x\u00b2 + (6x - 4x) - 8 = 3x\u00b2 + 2x - 8\n\nSo, the area as an expression in terms of x is 3x\u00b2 + 2x - 8.\n\nNow, substitute x = 5 into this expression:\n\nArea = 3(5)\u00b2 + 2(5) - 8\n\nCalculate 5 squared: 25\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n\nThen, 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n\nSo, area = 75 + 10 - 8 = 77\n\nAgain, I get 77 square units.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut let's double-check if I did everything correctly.\n\nFirst method: substitute x = 5 into length and width separately, then multiply.\n\nLength: 3(5) - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11\n\nWidth: 5 + 2 = 7\n\nArea: 11 \u00d7 7 = 77\n\nSecond method: multiply the expressions first, then substitute x = 5.\n\n(3x - 4)(x + 2) = 3x\u00b2 + 2x - 8\n\nThen, 3(5)\u00b2 + 2(5) - 8 = 75 + 10 - 8 = 77\n\nBoth methods confirm the area is 77 square units.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should check what happens if I choose a different value for x, just to see.\n\nLet's say x = 2.\n\nFirst method:\n\nLength: 3(2) - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\n\nWidth: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nArea: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nNow, using the expression for area: 3x\u00b2 + 2x - 8\n\nSubstitute x = 2:\n\n3(4) + 4 - 8 = 12 + 4 - 8 = 8\n\nAgain, both methods give the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the area when x = 5 is indeed 77 square units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{77} \\]"
