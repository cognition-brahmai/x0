        "content": "So the city wants to upgrade its public transportation system to handle more passengers and make things more convenient for everyone. Currently, there are 100,000 passengers riding the buses every day, and the average trip is 5 miles long. The goal is to increase ridership by 20% over the next three years, which means they want to handle 120,000 passengers per day eventually.\n\nThey also want to make sure that during peak hours, people don't have to wait longer than 10 minutes for a bus. That sounds like a good target for improving service.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many additional buses are needed to handle this increased ridership while maintaining that 10-minute maximum wait time during peak hours.\n\nLet's start by understanding the current situation and then see what needs to change.\n\n### Current Situation\n\n- **Daily Ridership:** 100,000 passengers\n\n- **Average Trip Length:** 5 miles\n\n- **Target Increase in Ridership:** 20% over three years \u2192 120,000 passengers per day\n\n- **Maximum Wait Time during Peak Hours:** 10 minutes\n\n- **Bus Capacity:** 50 passengers\n\n- **Average Speed of Buses:** 15 mph\n\n- **Maintenance Cost per Mile:** $0.25 per mile\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Increase in Ridership\n\nCurrent daily ridership: 100,000 passengers\n\nTarget increase: 20%\n\nAdditional riders needed: 100,000 * 0.20 = 20,000 passengers per day\n\nSo, the system needs to handle an additional 20,000 passengers per day.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Additional Trips Needed\n\nEach bus has a capacity of 50 passengers.\n\nAdditional trips needed per day: 20,000 passengers / 50 passengers per bus = 400 additional trips per day\n\nBut, this is the total additional trips per day. We need to figure out how many additional buses are needed to provide these trips, considering the operating hours and the frequency of service.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Operating Hours and Peak Hours\n\nTo proceed, I need to know the operating hours of the bus system and specifically the duration of peak hours.\n\nLet's assume the bus system operates for 18 hours a day, which is a common operation time for many cities.\n\nPeak hours are usually 2 to 3 hours in the morning and evening when people are commuting to and from work.\n\nLet's assume peak hours are 4 hours in total per day (2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Buses Needed During Peak Hours\n\nDuring peak hours, the city wants to have a maximum wait time of 10 minutes between buses.\n\nTo calculate the number of buses needed during peak hours, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of buses = (passengers during peak hours) / (bus capacity * number of trips per bus during peak hours)\n\nBut first, we need to estimate the passengers during peak hours.\n\n### Step 5: Estimate Passengers During Peak Hours\n\nAssuming that the peak hours account for a certain percentage of the total daily ridership.\n\nLet's assume that 40% of the daily ridership occurs during peak hours.\n\nSo, peak hour ridership: 120,000 * 0.40 = 48,000 passengers during peak hours\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of buses required to handle 48,000 passengers in 4 hours, with a maximum wait time of 10 minutes.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Number of Trips Needed During Peak Hours\n\nEach bus can make multiple trips during the peak hours.\n\nFirst, determine how many trips a single bus can make during peak hours.\n\nPeak hours: 4 hours\n\nAssuming a round trip takes a certain amount of time, which includes travel time and possible layover time.\n\nTravel time for a 5-mile trip at 15 mph:\n\nTime = distance / speed = 5 miles / 15 mph = 1/3 hour or 20 minutes per one-way trip.\n\nAssuming the round trip is 10 miles, time for round trip: 40 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, let's assume a 10-minute layover at the endpoint.\n\nSo, total time per cycle: 40 minutes (travel) + 10 minutes (layover) = 50 minutes per cycle.\n\nNumber of cycles per bus during peak hours: 4 hours / (50 minutes per cycle) = 240 minutes / 50 minutes \u2248 4.8 cycles, which we can round down to 4 cycles per bus during peak hours.\n\nTherefore, each bus can make 4 trips during peak hours.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Total Bus Capacity During Peak Hours\n\nEach bus can carry 50 passengers per trip.\n\nTotal passengers per bus during peak hours: 50 passengers/trip * 4 trips = 200 passengers per bus\n\nTotal passengers needed during peak hours: 48,000 passengers\n\nNumber of buses required: 48,000 passengers / 200 passengers per bus = 240 buses\n\nThis is the total number of buses needed during peak hours to handle the increased ridership of 120,000 passengers per day, with 40% during peak hours.\n\n### Step 8: Determine the Current Number of Buses\n\nTo find out how many additional buses are needed, we need to know the current number of buses operating during peak hours.\n\nLet's calculate the current number of buses during peak hours.\n\nCurrent daily ridership: 100,000 passengers\n\nAssuming the same 40% during peak hours: 100,000 * 0.40 = 40,000 passengers during peak hours\n\nUsing the same calculations as above:\n\nPassengers per bus during peak hours: 50 passengers/trip * 4 trips = 200 passengers per bus\n\nNumber of buses required currently: 40,000 passengers / 200 passengers per bus = 200 buses\n\n### Step 9: Calculate Additional Buses Needed\n\nAdditional buses needed: 240 buses (needed) - 200 buses (current) = 40 buses\n\nSo, the city needs to add 40 buses to handle the increased ridership during peak hours.\n\n### Step 10: Calculate Maintenance Costs for Additional Buses\n\nEach additional bus will have maintenance costs based on the miles it travels.\n\nFirst, determine the daily miles traveled by each bus.\n\nEach bus makes 4 round trips during peak hours: 4 trips * 10 miles per trip = 40 miles during peak hours.\n\nAssuming buses also operate during off-peak hours, let's calculate the total daily miles.\n\nTotal operating hours: 18 hours\n\nPeak hours: 4 hours\n\nOff-peak hours: 14 hours\n\nDuring off-peak hours, let's assume the bus operates with a lower frequency, say making 2 rounds per hour.\n\nTime per cycle:\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u6bb5\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4e3a50\u5206\u949f\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u62101.2\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\uff0860\u5206\u949f/50\u5206\u949f\u22481.2\u6b21\u5faa\u73af/\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u6bb5\uff0c\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u7684\u9891\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c2\u6b21\u5f80\u8fd4\u3002\n\n\u6bcf\u6b21\u5f80\u8fd410\u82f1\u91cc\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u884c\u9a7620\u82f1\u91cc\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u975e\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u6bb5\u884c\u9a76\u91cc\u7a0b\uff1a14\u5c0f\u65f6 * 20\u82f1\u91cc/\u5c0f\u65f6 = 280\u82f1\u91cc\n\n\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u6bb5\u884c\u9a76\u91cc\u7a0b\uff1a40\u82f1\u91cc\n\n\u603b daily miles per bus: 40 + 280 = 320 miles per day\n\n\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\uff1a$0.25 per mile\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f86\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\uff1a320 miles * $0.25/mile = $80 per day\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e40\u8f86\u989d\u5916\u7684\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\uff0c\u6bcf\u65e5\u603b\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\uff1a40 buses * $80/bus = $3,200 per day\n\n### \u603b\u7ed3\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u672a\u6765\u4e09\u5e74\u5185 ridership \u589e\u957f20%\u81f3120,000\u4e58\u5ba2/\u5929\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u6bb5\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u5927\u7b49\u5019\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a10\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u9700\u8981\u589e\u52a040\u8f86\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u989d\u5916\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u5c06\u662f$3,200\u3002\n\n\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u4e8e\u82e5\u5e72\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u8fd0\u8425\u5c0f\u65f6\u6570\u3001\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u6bb5\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6bcf\u8f86\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u6b21\u6570\u7b49\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u3002"
