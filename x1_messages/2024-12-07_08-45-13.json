Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a mixture of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nSearchEngine[input]: Tool that allows the user to search for information using a general-purpose search engine. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkExtractor[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nQAModel[input]: Question answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the most popular dish in Italy and what are its main ingredients?"

Maybe look for mentions of specific dishes like spaghetti, pizza, lasagna, etc., and see which one is referred to most often as the most popular.\n\nOnce I identify the dish, I need to find out its main ingredients. So, I'll look for recipes or descriptions of that dish in the scraped content.\n\nIf I can't find enough information from the initial search, I might need to perform another search specifically for the ingredients of that dish.\n\nPlan: If necessary, search for the main ingredients of the identified dish.\n:evidence3: = SearchEngine[\"main ingredients of \" + :evidence2:]\n\nThen, extract the links from these new search results.\n\nPlan: Extract links from the new search results.\n:evidence4: = LinkExtractor[:evidence3:]\n\nScrape the content from these links to find the ingredients.\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from the selected links.\n:evidence5: = WebScraper[:evidence4:]\n\nFinally, use the QAModel to summarize the information and provide a clear answer to the user's question.\n\nPlan: Use QAModel to answer the user's question based on the gathered evidence.\n:evidence6: = QAModel[\"What is the most popular dish in Italy and what are its main ingredients?
