        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a school election with three candidates: X, Y, and Z. Candidate X got 45% of the votes, candidate Y got 35%, and candidate Z got the remaining votes. There were a total of 800 votes cast, and I need to find out how many more votes candidate X received compared to candidate Y.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many votes each candidate received. Since the total votes are 800, and candidate X got 45%, I can calculate X's votes by taking 45% of 800. Similarly, for candidate Y, I'll take 35% of 800. Then, to find out how many more votes X received than Y, I'll subtract Y's votes from X's votes.\n\nLet me start by calculating X's votes:\n\nX's votes = 45% of 800\n\nTo calculate 45% of 800, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply by the total votes.\n\n45% = 0.45\n\nSo, X's votes = 0.45 * 800\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.45 * 800 = 360\n\nSo, candidate X received 360 votes.\n\nNext, I'll calculate Y's votes:\n\nY's votes = 35% of 800\n\nAgain, convert the percentage to a decimal:\n\n35% = 0.35\n\nSo, Y's votes = 0.35 * 800\n\nLet me multiply:\n\n0.35 * 800 = 280\n\nCandidate Y received 280 votes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes X received than Y, I'll subtract Y's votes from X's votes:\n\n360 - 280 = 80\n\nSo, candidate X received 80 more votes than candidate Y.\n\nWait a minute, the problem also mentions candidate Z, who received the remaining votes. Although it's not directly asked, maybe I should check how many votes Z received to ensure everything adds up correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll find out what percentage of votes Z received. Since X had 45% and Y had 35%, together they have 45% + 35% = 80%. Therefore, Z must have the remaining 20% of the votes.\n\nLet me calculate Z's votes:\n\nZ's votes = 20% of 800\n\n20% = 0.20\n\nSo, Z's votes = 0.20 * 800 = 160\n\nNow, let's add up all the votes to verify:\n\nX: 360\n\nY: 280\n\nZ: 160\n\nTotal = 360 + 280 + 160 = 800, which matches the total votes cast.\n\nSo, my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, candidate X received 80 more votes than candidate Y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
