It is one of the three Deathly Hallows, which also include the Elder Wand and the Cloak of Invisibility. The Resurrection Stone has the power to summon the spirits of the deceased, allowing for communication or brief reunions with loved ones who have passed away. However, it's important to note that the stone does not truly bring people back to life but rather allows for interaction with their spirits."
