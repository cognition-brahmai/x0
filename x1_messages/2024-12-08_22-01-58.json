        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are shirts in three sizes: small, medium, and large. The store has twice as many small shirts as medium shirts, and three times as many large shirts as medium shirts. Altogether, there are 66 shirts. I need to find out how many of each size there are.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to represent the number of each size of shirts. Let's let M represent the number of medium shirts. Then, since there are twice as many small shirts as medium shirts, the number of small shirts would be 2M. Similarly, there are three times as many large shirts as medium shirts, so the number of large shirts would be 3M.\n\nNow, the total number of shirts is the sum of small, medium, and large shirts. So, that would be:\n\nSmall + Medium + Large = Total\n\nWhich is:\n\n2M + M + 3M = 66\n\nCombining like terms, that's:\n\n6M = 66\n\nNow, to find M, I can divide both sides by 6:\n\nM = 66 / 6\n\nM = 11\n\nSo, there are 11 medium shirts.\n\nNow, to find the number of small shirts:\n\nSmall = 2M = 2 * 11 = 22\n\nAnd the number of large shirts:\n\nLarge = 3M = 3 * 11 = 33\n\nLet me check if these add up to 66:\n\n22 (small) + 11 (medium) + 33 (large) = 66\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThere are 22 small shirts, 11 medium shirts, and 33 large shirts."
