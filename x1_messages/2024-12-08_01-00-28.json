        "content": "So, the car park has 6 floors, and each floor has 15 parking spaces. I need to find out how many cars the car park can hold when it's full.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. There are multiple floors, and each floor has a certain number of parking spaces. To find the total capacity, I need to calculate the total number of parking spaces across all floors.\n\nSince each floor has 15 spaces and there are 6 floors, I can multiply the number of floors by the number of spaces per floor to get the total number of spaces.\n\nSo, that would be 6 floors times 15 spaces per floor.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 6 times 15.\n\nI know that 6 times 10 is 60, and 6 times 5 is 30. So, 60 plus 30 is 90.\n\nTherefore, the car park can hold 90 cars when it's full.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there a possibility that not all spaces are for cars, or maybe some spaces are reserved for other vehicles? But the question says \"parking spaces,\" so I assume they are all for cars.\n\nAlso, it's mentioned that the car park has 6 floors, and each floor has 15 spaces. So, 6 times 15 should give me the total number of spaces.\n\nLet me double-check my multiplication. 6 times 15:\n\n6 \u00d7 15 = 6 \u00d7 (10 + 5) = (6 \u00d7 10) + (6 \u00d7 5) = 60 + 30 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as adding 15 six times: 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15.\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n15 + 15 = 30\n\n30 + 15 = 45\n\n45 + 15 = 60\n\n60 + 15 = 75\n\n75 + 15 = 90\n\nSo, again, I get 90.\n\nAnother way to verify is to consider if there are any empty spaces or restrictions, but the question asks for the total number when the car park is full, so all spaces are occupied by cars.\n\nTherefore, the car park can hold 90 cars when it's full.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
