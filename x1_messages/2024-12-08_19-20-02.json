        "content": "Let's tackle this expression step by step. The expression given is:\n\n(6 * 4) / 2 + 5^2 - 10\n\nFirst, I need to remember the order of operations, often abbreviated as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n(6 * 4) = 24\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n24 / 2 + 5^2 - 10\n\nNext, exponents:\n\n5^2 = 25\n\nSo now it's:\n\n24 / 2 + 25 - 10\n\nThen, multiplication and division from left to right. Here, we have division first:\n\n24 / 2 = 12\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n12 + 25 - 10\n\nFinally, addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n12 + 25 = 37\n\nThen, 37 - 10 = 27\n\nSo, the final answer is 27.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]"
