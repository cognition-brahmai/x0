        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car rental company has two parts to their charging: a flat fee per day and an additional charge per mile driven.\n\nFirst, the flat fee is $20 per day. The customer is renting the car for 5 days. So, the total cost for the days rented would be:\n\n20 dollars/day * 5 days = 100 dollars\n\nNext, there's a charge of $0.10 per mile driven. The customer drove 350 miles. So, the cost for the miles driven would be:\n\n0.10 dollars/mile * 350 miles = 35 dollars\n\nNow, to find the total cost, we'll add the two amounts together:\n\n100 dollars + 35 dollars = 135 dollars\n\nTherefore, the total cost for renting the car for 5 days and driving 350 miles would be $135.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{135} \\]"
