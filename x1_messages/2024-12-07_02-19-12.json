        "content": "So there are 100 houses in the village, and each house has a number of doors that corresponds to its house number. That means the first house has 1 door, the second has 2 doors, up to the hundredth house which has 100 doors. I need to find out the total number of doors in the entire village.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem about adding up a sequence of numbers. Specifically, it's the sum of the first 100 positive integers. I remember there's a formula for calculating the sum of an arithmetic series, which is what this is\u2014an arithmetic series where each term increases by 1.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n positive integers is \\( S = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). In this case, n is 100 because there are 100 houses.\n\nSo, plugging in the value, it would be \\( S = \\frac{100(100 + 1)}{2} \\).\n\nLet me calculate that: 100 plus 1 is 101, multiplied by 100 is 10,100, and then divided by 2 is 5,050.\n\nTherefore, the total number of doors in the village is 5,050.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can think about it another way. If I pair up the houses, like the first and the last: 1 door plus 100 doors is 101 doors. Then the second and the second-to-last: 2 plus 99 is also 101. And this pattern continues all the way up to the 50th and 51st houses: 50 plus 51 is 101.\n\nSince there are 100 houses, there are 50 such pairs, each summing to 101. So, 50 pairs times 101 is 5,050.\n\nThat matches the answer I got from the formula, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100, and add them up individually, I should also get 5,050. But that would take a lot more time and effort, especially with 100 terms.\n\nI think the formula is the most efficient way to solve this problem. It's a well-known formula, and it's good to remember it for situations like this.\n\nSo, the total number of doors in the village is 5,050.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5050} \\]"
