        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Tom who has twice as many apples as oranges. Let's use some variables to represent the numbers. Let\u2019s say the number of oranges Tom has is O. Since he has twice as many apples as oranges, the number of apples would be 2O.\n\nNow, Tom gives away half of his apples and one-third of his oranges to his friends. So, he gives away (1/2)*(2O) apples and (1/3)*O oranges.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate that:\n\nHalf of his apples: (1/2)*(2O) = O apples given away.\n\nOne-third of his oranges: (1/3)*O oranges given away.\n\nSo, the apples left would be:\n\nOriginal apples - apples given away = 2O - O = O apples left.\n\nAnd the oranges left would be:\n\nOriginal oranges - oranges given away = O - (1/3)*O = (2/3)*O oranges left.\n\nNow, after giving them away, he has a total of 42 fruits left. So, the sum of the apples left and oranges left is 42.\n\nSo, O + (2/3)*O = 42.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for O:\n\nO + (2/3)*O = 42.\n\nTo combine these, we need a common denominator, which is 3:\n\n(3/3)*O + (2/3)*O = 42.\n\n(5/3)*O = 42.\n\nNow, to find O, we can multiply both sides by 3/5:\n\nO = 42 * (3/5).\n\nO = 126/5.\n\nO = 25.2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the number of oranges should be a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nWe have:\n\nApples originally: 2O.\n\nApples given away: (1/2)*(2O) = O.\n\nApples left: 2O - O = O.\n\nOranges originally: O.\n\nOranges given away: (1/3)*O.\n\nOranges left: O - (1/3)*O = (2/3)*O.\n\nTotal fruits left: O + (2/3)*O = 42.\n\nSo, (5/3)*O = 42.\n\nThen, O = 42 * (3/5) = 126/5 = 25.2.\n\nHmm, still getting 25.2, which isn't a whole number. But fruits are whole items, so maybe there's a mistake in the interpretation.\n\nLet me try approaching it differently. Maybe I should use different variables.\n\nLet\u2019s let the number of oranges be O, and the number of apples be A.\n\nAccording to the problem, A = 2O.\n\nHe gives away half of his apples and one-third of his oranges.\n\nSo, apples given away: (1/2)*A.\n\nOranges given away: (1/3)*O.\n\nTherefore, apples left: A - (1/2)*A = (1/2)*A.\n\nOranges left: O - (1/3)*O = (2/3)*O.\n\nTotal fruits left: (1/2)*A + (2/3)*O = 42.\n\nBut since A = 2O, substitute that into the equation:\n\n(1/2)*(2O) + (2/3)*O = 42.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1)*O + (2/3)*O = 42.\n\nSo, O + (2/3)*O = 42.\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to O = 25.2.\n\nThat can't be right. Maybe the problem isn't assuming only apples and oranges are the fruits he has. Maybe he has other fruits too, but the problem only mentions apples and oranges.\n\nWait, the problem says \"he has a total of 42 fruits left,\" implying that only apples and oranges are his fruits.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the number of oranges is not a whole number, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nLet me read it again: \"Tom has twice as many apples as oranges. He gives away half of his apples and one-third of his oranges to his friends. After giving them away, he has a total of 42 fruits left. How many apples did Tom originally have?\"\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the number of oranges is a multiple of 3 so that one-third is a whole number.\n\nLet\u2019s assume O is divisible by 3. Let\u2019s say O = 3K, where K is an integer.\n\nThen A = 2O = 6K.\n\nApples given away: (1/2)*6K = 3K.\n\nOranges given away: (1/3)*3K = K.\n\nApples left: 6K - 3K = 3K.\n\nOranges left: 3K - K = 2K.\n\nTotal fruits left: 3K + 2K = 5K = 42.\n\nSo, 5K = 42.\n\nThen, K = 42 / 5 = 8.4.\n\nAgain, not a whole number. This suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself, or perhaps there's additional information I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Tom has other fruits besides apples and oranges, but the problem doesn't mention that. It seems to imply that he only has apples and oranges.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can set up equations and solve them.\n\nLet A be the number of apples and O be the number of oranges.\n\nWe know that A = 2O.\n\nHe gives away (1/2)A apples and (1/3)O oranges.\n\nSo, apples left: A - (1/2)A = (1/2)A.\n\nOranges left: O - (1/3)O = (2/3)O.\n\nTotal fruits left: (1/2)A + (2/3)O = 42.\n\nBut since A = 2O, substitute:\n\n(1/2)*(2O) + (2/3)O = 42.\n\nSimplify:\n\nO + (2/3)O = 42.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(5/3)O = 42.\n\nThen, O = 42 * (3/5) = 126/5 = 25.2.\n\nAgain, not a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the problem has a mistake, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the \"total of 42 fruits left\" includes other types of fruits that he didn't give away. But the problem doesn't mention any other fruits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Tom has apples and oranges, and after giving some away, the total left is 42.\n\nBut in all approaches, I'm getting O = 25.2, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of an orange.\n\nMaybe the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number, but that seems unlikely in a math problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the total fruits left should be a number that is divisible by 5/3 for O to be a whole number.\n\nFor example, if the total fruits left were 45, then (5/3)O = 45 => O = 27, which is a whole number.\n\nBut since the problem says 42, I'm stuck with O = 25.2.\n\nPerhaps it's a trick question, and the answer is not a whole number, which would be unusual for fruits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of oranges is a multiple of 3, and the number of apples is even, but that doesn't resolve the issue.\n\nI think there might be an error in the problem setup. Maybe the ratios or the total fruits left need to be adjusted for the numbers to work out to whole fruits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach I'm missing.\n\nLet me try to set up the equations differently.\n\nLet O be the number of oranges.\n\nThen, apples A = 2O.\n\nApples given away: (1/2)A = (1/2)(2O) = O.\n\nOranges given away: (1/3)O.\n\nTherefore, apples left: A - O = 2O - O = O.\n\nOranges left: O - (1/3)O = (2/3)O.\n\nTotal fruits left: O + (2/3)O = (5/3)O = 42.\n\nSo, O = 42 * (3/5) = 126/5 = 25.2.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nThis suggests that either the problem has a mistake, or it's intentionally set up to have a fractional answer, which is unusual for counting fruits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is meant to be solved with algebra, accepting a fractional number of fruits.\n\nBut typically, in such problems, the numbers are chosen so that the solution is a whole number.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the number of oranges is a variable and solve for it.\n\nLet\u2019s try to solve for O in terms of A.\n\nGiven A = 2O.\n\nApples left: A - (1/2)A = (1/2)A.\n\nOranges left: O - (1/3)O = (2/3)O.\n\nTotal fruits left: (1/2)A + (2/3)O = 42.\n\nBut A = 2O, so substitute:\n\n(1/2)(2O) + (2/3)O = 42.\n\nO + (2/3)O = 42.\n\n(5/3)O = 42.\n\nO = 42 * (3/5) = 126/5 = 25.2.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve for A directly.\n\nWe know A = 2O.\n\nTotal fruits left: (1/2)A + (2/3)(A/2) = 42.\n\nSince O = A/2.\n\nSo, (1/2)A + (2/3)(A/2) = 42.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/2)A + (1/3)A = 42.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3/6)A + (2/6)A = 42.\n\n(5/6)A = 42.\n\nThen, A = 42 * (6/5) = 252/5 = 50.4.\n\nSo, A = 50.4 apples originally.\n\nBut again, that's not a whole number.\n\nThis reinforces the earlier result.\n\nIt seems there's an inconsistency in the problem as presented, leading to fractional numbers of fruits, which is unusual.\n\nPerhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem statement.\n\nLet me try considering that \"he has a total of 42 fruits left\" includes other types of fruits, but the problem doesn't mention any other fruits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fractions are not exact, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that he gives away half of his apples and one-third of his oranges, and what's left (after giving away) totals 42.\n\nWait, that's how I interpreted it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question to test attention to detail, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be solved with algebra, accepting fractional solutions, but typically, such problems involve whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and the total fruits left should be a number that allows O to be a whole number.\n\nFor example, if the total fruits left were 45, then O = 27, which is a whole number.\n\nBut since the problem says 42, I'm stuck with O = 25.2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fractions are to be interpreted differently, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of oranges is a multiple of both 2 and 3 to make the fractions work out to whole numbers, but that doesn't resolve the issue here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended for a higher level of math, allowing for fractional fruits, but that seems unlikely for this type of problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that Tom cannot have a fractional number of fruits, so the problem has no solution, but that seems like an unsatisfactory conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solving the problem that I'm missing.\n\nLet me try to set up the equations again.\n\nLet O be the number of oranges.\n\nThen, A = 2O.\n\nApples given away: (1/2)A = O.\n\nOranges given away: (1/3)O.\n\nApples left: A - O = O.\n\nOranges left: O - (1/3)O = (2/3)O.\n\nTotal fruits left: O + (2/3)O = (5/3)O = 42.\n\nTherefore, O = 42 * (3/5) = 126/5 = 25.2.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the number of oranges is a multiple of 5, but that doesn't seem to help here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be solved using estimation or approximation, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the total fruits left should be 45, which would give O = 27, and A = 54, which are whole numbers.\n\nBut since the problem says 42, I have to conclude that either the problem has an error or it's acceptable to have fractional fruits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the number of oranges must be a multiple of 3, and the number of apples must be even, but that doesn't resolve the fractional issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test the understanding that fractions of fruits don't make sense, but that seems like an unusual lesson.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be solved by recognizing that the number of oranges must be a whole number, and therefore the total fruits left must be adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut again, that suggests a problem with the problem itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that Tom had other fruits, and the 42 fruits left include those, but the problem doesn't mention any other fruits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be solved by recognizing that the number of oranges is 25.2, and thus the number of apples is 50.4, but that doesn't make practical sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of O, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of \"gives away half of his apples and one-third of his oranges.\"\n\nMaybe it's given in terms of percentages or ratios differently, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by setting up and solving the equation, accepting the fractional answer, but again, that seems unusual for this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that Tom cannot have a fractional number of fruits, and therefore such a scenario is impossible.\n\nBut that seems like an extreme conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation.\n\nWe have O + (2/3)O = 42.\n\nThat's (5/3)O = 42.\n\nThen, O = 42 * (3/5) = 126/5 = 25.2.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to round O to 25 or 26 and see which one fits.\n\nLet\u2019s try O = 25.\n\nThen A = 50.\n\nApples given away: 25.\n\nApples left: 25.\n\nOranges given away: 8.333... which isn't a whole number.\n\nSo, doesn't work.\n\nNow, O = 26.\n\nThen A = 52.\n\nApples given away: 26.\n\nApples left: 26.\n\nOranges given away: 8.666..., again not a whole number.\n\nSo, doesn't work.\n\nNow, O = 24.\n\nThen A = 48.\n\nApples given away: 24.\n\nApples left: 24.\n\nOranges given away: 8.\n\nOranges left: 16.\n\nTotal fruits left: 24 + 16 = 40, which is less than 42.\n\nNot matching.\n\nO = 27.\n\nA = 54.\n\nApples given away: 27.\n\nApples left: 27.\n\nOranges given away: 9.\n\nOranges left: 18.\n\nTotal fruits left: 27 + 18 = 45, which is more than 42.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nSo, none of these whole numbers for O give a total of 42 fruits left.\n\nThis reinforces the earlier conclusion that the problem, as stated, leads to a fractional number of fruits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have O = 25.2, and A = 50.4, but that doesn't make practical sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and the total fruits left should be adjusted to make O a whole number.\n\nFor example, if total fruits left were 45, then O = 27, A = 54, which are whole numbers.\n\nSimilarly, if total fruits left were 40, then O = 24, A = 48, but as seen earlier, that doesn't add up to 42.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fractions are to be interpreted differently, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved symbolically, but that seems beyond the scope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that the number of oranges must be a multiple of 3 and even, but that doesn't resolve the issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret \"gives away half of his apples and one-third of his oranges.\"\n\nMaybe \"half of his apples\" is interpreted as half of the total apples, which is the same as (1/2)A.\n\nSimilarly, \"one-third of his oranges\" is (1/3)O.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider that giving away these amounts leaves 42 fruits.\n\nBut that's how I interpreted it earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"half of his apples\" is interpreted differently, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be solved using algebraic expressions and accepted that the solution may not be whole numbers, but that seems impractical for counting fruits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and it should be \"he gives away half of his oranges and one-third of his apples,\" but that would change the problem entirely.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nSo, if he gives away half of his oranges and one-third of his apples.\n\nThen, oranges given away: (1/2)O.\n\nApples given away: (1/3)A.\n\nApples left: A - (1/3)A = (2/3)A.\n\nOranges left: O - (1/2)O = (1/2)O.\n\nTotal fruits left: (2/3)A + (1/2)O = 42.\n\nGiven that A = 2O.\n\nSubstitute A with 2O:\n\n(2/3)(2O) + (1/2)O = 42.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4/3)O + (1/2)O = 42.\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 6:\n\n(8/6)O + (3/6)O = 42.\n\n(11/6)O = 42.\n\nThen, O = 42 * (6/11) = 252/11 \u2248 22.909, which is still not a whole number.\n\nSo, that approach also leads to a fractional number of oranges.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the original problem, as stated, leads to a fractional number of fruits, which is impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved differently, but I can't see another logical approach.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and standard interpretation, Tom originally had A = 50.4 apples.\n\nBut since that doesn't make practical sense, perhaps the problem needs to be revised or reconsidered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and the total fruits left should be a different number to yield whole numbers for apples and oranges.\n\nIn conclusion, according to the given problem and standard interpretation, Tom originally had 50.4 apples, but since that's not a whole number, the problem may have an error or may be intended to be solved differently."
