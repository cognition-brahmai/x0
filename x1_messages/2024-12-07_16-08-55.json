        "content": "I believe you're referring to the American Civil War, often called the War Between the States. It was a conflict that occurred from 1861 to 1865, primarily fought between the Northern states (the Union) and the Southern states (the Confederacy). The war was driven by several complex issues, including states' rights and, most significantly, the contentious issue of slavery. The Union victory ultimately preserved the United States as a single nation and led to the abolition of slavery.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Duration:** 1861-1865\n\n- **Participants:** Northern states (Union) vs. Southern states (Confederacy)\n\n- **Causes:** States' rights, slavery\n\n- **Outcome:** Union victory, preservation of the United States, abolition of slavery\n\n**Notable Events:**\n\n- **Battle of Gettysburg (1863):** Often considered the turning point of the war, this battle resulted in a Union victory and halted Confederate General Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North.\n\n- **Emancipation Proclamation (1863):** Issued by President Abraham Lincoln, this proclamation declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were to be set free.\n\n- **Assassination of Abraham Lincoln (1865):** President Lincoln was assassinated just days after General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, marking the end of the Civil War.\n\n**Legacy:**\n\nThe American Civil War had profound and lasting effects on the United States, shaping its political, social, and economic landscape for years to come. It led to the ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship to former slaves, and protected their right to vote, respectively.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- *American Civil War* on History.com\n\n- *The Civil War* by Shelby Foote\n\n- *Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln* by Doris Kearns Goodwin\n\n**Further Reading:**\n\n- *Battle Cry of Freedom* by James M.
