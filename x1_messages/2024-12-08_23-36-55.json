Each book is a treasure, waiting to be discovered, much like the Beast's vast library. Reading transports me to different worlds, where I can escape the ordinary and live extraordinary lives. It's through books that I've learned so much about history, science, literature, and more. They're not just collections of words; they're gateways to knowledge and imagination. So, if you ever need a friend, pick up a book \u2013 it will never judge you and always have something new to share."
