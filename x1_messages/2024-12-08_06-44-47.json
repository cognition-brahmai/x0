        "content": "Let's see. There's a fruit vendor who has apples and oranges. Total fruits are 80, and the ratio of apples to oranges is 7:1. I need to find out how many oranges he has.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 7:1 for apples to oranges means that for every 7 apples, there is 1 orange. So, the total parts of the ratio are 7 + 1 = 8 parts.\n\nNow, since the total number of fruits is 80, and these are divided into 8 parts, each part must represent 80 divided by 8. Let me calculate that:\n\n80 \u00f7 8 = 10.\n\nSo, each part of the ratio represents 10 fruits.\n\nSince oranges are 1 part of the ratio, the number of oranges is 1 \u00d7 10 = 10.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I'm doing this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of fractions. The ratio of apples to oranges is 7:1, which means oranges are 1 part out of the total 8 parts.\n\nSo, the fraction of fruits that are oranges is 1/8.\n\nTherefore, the number of oranges is 1/8 of 80.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1/8 \u00d7 80 = 10.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up equations. Let\u2019s denote the number of apples as A and the number of oranges as O.\n\nWe know that A + O = 80 (total fruits).\n\nAnd the ratio A:O = 7:1, which means A = 7O.\n\nNow, substitute A in the first equation:\n\n7O + O = 80\n\n8O = 80\n\nO = 80 \u00f7 8\n\nO = 10.\n\nAgain, I get 10 oranges.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nIf there are 10 oranges, then the number of apples is 7 times that, which is 7 \u00d7 10 = 70 apples.\n\nTotal fruits: 70 + 10 = 80, which matches the given total.\n\nAlso, the ratio is 70:10, which simplifies to 7:1, which matches the given ratio.\n\nSo, it seems definite that there are 10 oranges.\n\nWait, but ratios can sometimes be a bit tricky. Maybe I should consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nFor example, is it possible that the ratio includes both apples and oranges in a different way? But no, the ratio 7:1 clearly indicates apples to oranges.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the ratio is by weight or number. But since the question specifies the number of fruits, it should be by number.\n\nAlso, the problem states that there are only apples and oranges, so no other fruits to consider.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is solid: there are 10 oranges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
