It feels like a dream come true.\n\nRemember when we were kids, and mom used to tell us stories before bed? She had this knack for making even the simplest tales sound magical. I loved how she'd tuck us in, with me on one side and you on the other, our heads almost touching as we listened intently. Do you recall that one about the princess who found her way home through a maze of mirrors? I always thought that was our story\u2014getting lost and then finding our way back to each other.\n\nThose summers at grandma's house are etched in my memory. The way the sun would beam down, making the world seem brighter, and how we'd spend hours chasing fireflies in the evening, trying to catch them in jars. We had this competition to see who could capture the most, but really, it was just an excuse to laugh and play together. I remember once, you fell into the flower bed while running after one particularly elusive firefly. Mom scolded us, but I could see the smile trying to escape her lips.\n\nAnd what about our treehouse? Oh, that was our sanctuary. We spent countless hours up there, sharing secrets and dreaming about the future. I remember you had this big plan to become an astronaut and explore the stars. You were so determined, always pointing at the night sky and naming the constellations. I was more content with just observing, maybe becoming a writer someday, capturing stories like the ones mom told us.\n\nLife took us in different directions, didn't it? I moved away for college, and you went off to pursue your dreams too. Letters became less frequent, calls even rarer. There were times when I thought maybe we'd lost touch forever. But here we are, connected again, and I can't be happier.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about our future. Maybe we could plan a trip together, revisiting some of those old places that hold so many memories. Imagine going back to grandma's house, seeing if the treehouse still stands, or at least rebuilding it. And perhaps, just perhaps, we could create new memories, ones that our future selves will look back on with the same warmth and love.\n\nI miss you, Jane. More than words can express. I look forward to catching up, to hearing all about your life, your achievements, your dreams. I have so much to tell you too\u2014about my career, my friends, the places I've seen. But most of all, I want to hear your voice, feel your embrace, and know that no matter what happens, we'll always have each other.\n\nLet's make the most of this second chance, shall we? I can't wait to see you again.\n\nWith all my love,\n\nMary"
