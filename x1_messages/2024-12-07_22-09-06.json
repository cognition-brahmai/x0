        "content": "Let's see. There are 25 students in the class, and each student gets 3 pencils. So, the total number of pencils given to students would be 25 multiplied by 3, which is 75 pencils. Additionally, the teacher keeps 5 extra pencils for herself. Therefore, the total number of pencils the teacher has initially should be the sum of the pencils given to students and the extra pencils she keeps. So, 75 plus 5 equals 80 pencils. Hence, the teacher initially has 80 pencils."
