        "content": "So I've got this problem here about fencing a rectangular garden. The garden is 30 meters long and 15 meters wide, and I need to build a fence around it using posts that are placed 5 meters apart. I need to figure out how many posts I'll need in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the perimeter of the garden because the fence is going around the entire garden. For a rectangle, the perimeter P is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2 * (length + width)\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\nP = 2 * (30m + 15m) = 2 * 45m = 90 meters\n\nOkay, so the total perimeter is 90 meters. Now, posts are placed every 5 meters. So, to find out how many posts I need, I can divide the perimeter by the distance between posts.\n\nNumber of posts = Perimeter / Distance between posts = 90m / 5m = 18 posts\n\nWait a minute, but in fencing, especially when placing posts at regular intervals around a closed shape like a rectangle, I need to consider whether the starting post and the ending post coincide. In a closed loop, the first and last post are the same, so I might be double-counting if I just divide the perimeter by the interval.\n\nLet me think about this differently. For a closed fence, the number of intervals between posts is equal to the number of posts. So, if the perimeter is 90 meters and posts are every 5 meters, the number of intervals is 90 / 5 = 18. Therefore, the number of posts is also 18.\n\nBut let me double-check this with another approach. Let's consider the rectangle has two lengths of 30 meters and two widths of 15 meters.\n\nFor one length of 30 meters, the number of posts would be 30 / 5 = 6 posts. But wait, if I place a post every 5 meters, starting at 0 meters, then the posts would be at 0m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 25m, and 30m. That's 7 posts for one length.\n\nWait, that seems off because according to my earlier calculation, it should be fewer posts. Let me count again.\n\nIf I start at one corner and place a post every 5 meters along the 30-meter length:\n\n- Post 1 at 0m\n\n- Post 2 at 5m\n\n- Post 3 at 10m\n\n- Post 4 at 15m\n\n- Post 5 at 20m\n\n- Post 6 at 25m\n\n- Post 7 at 30m\n\nSo, that's 7 posts for one length.\n\nSimilarly, for the width of 15 meters:\n\n- Post 1 at 0m\n\n- Post 2 at 5m\n\n- Post 3 at 10m\n\n- Post 4 at 15m\n\nThat's 4 posts for one width.\n\nNow, since it's a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. But the corners are shared by both sides. So, if I simply add the posts along all sides, I'll be double-counting the corner posts.\n\nSo, total posts without considering overlaps:\n\nTwo lengths: 2 * 7 = 14 posts\n\nTwo widths: 2 * 4 = 8 posts\n\nTotal: 14 + 8 = 22 posts\n\nBut since the corner posts are shared, I need to subtract the overlapping posts. There are four corners, so four overlapping posts.\n\nTherefore, total posts needed: 22 - 4 = 18 posts\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering the fence is a closed loop, the number of intervals between posts is equal to the number of posts. With a perimeter of 90 meters and posts every 5 meters, there are 90 / 5 = 18 intervals, hence 18 posts.\n\nSo, both methods give me 18 posts.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Is the fence going to have a gate or anything like that? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume the fence is continuous without any breaks.\n\nAlso, I assumed that posts are placed at both ends of each side, which is standard for fencing. But in some fencing designs, the post at the end of one side might be the same as the post at the start of the next side. That's why I accounted for overlapping corner posts.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total number of intervals around the perimeter and then know that each interval has one post at the end.\n\nSo, perimeter is 90 meters, posts every 5 meters, so 90 / 5 = 18 intervals, therefore 18 posts.\n\nYes, I think 18 is the correct number of posts needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
