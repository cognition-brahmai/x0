        "content": "So the company spent $5,000 on advertising and got 500 new customers from it. Now, they want to get 1,000 more customers through advertising and they're wondering how much more they need to spend.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the cost per customer. If they spent $5,000 for 500 customers, then the cost per customer is $5,000 divided by 500, right? Let me calculate that.\n\n$5,000 \u00f7 500 = $10 per customer.\n\nSo, for each new customer, it costs the company $10.\n\nNow, they want 1,000 more customers. If each customer costs $10, then 1,000 customers would cost 1,000 times $10.\n\n1,000 \u00d7 $10 = $10,000.\n\nTherefore, the company should spend an additional $10,000 on advertising to gain 1,000 more customers.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's a limit to this. Maybe the relationship isn't linear. Perhaps there are diminishing returns with more advertising spending. But based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more efficient way to calculate this. Let's see.\n\nThe ratio of spending to customers is $5,000 to 500 customers. So, the ratio is 5,000:500, which simplifies to 10:1 (dollars per customer).\n\nSo, for every additional customer, it's $10.\n\nTherefore, for 1,000 customers, it's $10,000.\n\nAlternatively, if they want to gain a total of 1,500 customers (500 already gained + 1,000 more), the total spending would be 1,500 customers times $10 per customer, which is $15,000.\n\nSince they've already spent $5,000, the additional amount they need to spend is $15,000 - $5,000 = $10,000.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer: $10,000.\n\nI think that's clear.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10000} \\]"
