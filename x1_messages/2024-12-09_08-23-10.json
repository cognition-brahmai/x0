        "content": "So I've got this question here about hydrocarbons in organic chemistry. It's asking which of the options isn't a property of hydrocarbons. Let's see what we've got:\n\nOption A says they are composed only of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Hmm, that sounds right. Hydrocarbons, by definition, should only have hydrogen and carbon in their structure. So, that seems like a correct statement.\n\nOption B mentions that they can form straight, branched, or cyclic structures. I know that hydrocarbons can indeed have different shapes. For example, alkanes can be straight chains, branched, or even form rings like cyclohexane. So, this also seems accurate.\n\nOption C says they are always soluble in water. Now, I recall that hydrocarbons are generally nonpolar because carbon and hydrogen have similar electronegativities. Water, on the other hand, is polar. So, the general rule is that \"like dissolves like,\" meaning nonpolar substances don't dissolve well in polar solvents. Therefore, hydrocarbons should not be soluble in water. But the option says \"always soluble in water,\" which sounds incorrect based on my knowledge.\n\nOption D talks about hydrocarbons being saturated or unsaturated. I know that saturated hydrocarbons have single bonds between carbon atoms, like alkanes, while unsaturated hydrocarbons have double or triple bonds, like alkenes and alkynes. So, this seems correct as well.\n\nLooking back, option C stands out as the one that doesn't sound right. But to be thorough, let's double-check each option.\n\nOption A: Yes, hydrocarbons are composed only of hydrogen and carbon atoms. That's their definition.\n\nOption B: Hydrocarbons can indeed have various structures\u2014straight chains, branches, and rings.\n\nOption C: Hydrocarbons are not always soluble in water. In fact, they are generally insoluble in water due to their nonpolar nature.\n\nOption D: Correct again; hydrocarbons can be saturated or unsaturated based on their bonding.\n\nSo, the statement that isn't a property of hydrocarbons is option C: They are always soluble in water. It's actually the opposite; they are generally insoluble in water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
