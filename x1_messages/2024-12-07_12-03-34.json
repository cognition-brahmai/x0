        "content": "Let's tackle this equation: e^(2x) - 5e^x + 6 = 0. At first glance, it looks a bit tricky, but if I break it down step by step, I think I can solve it.\n\nSo, I notice that there's an e^(2x) term and an e^x term. I recall that e^(2x) is actually (e^x)^2. Hmm, that seems useful because it makes the equation look somewhat like a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations are of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, and we know how to solve those using factoring or the quadratic formula.\n\nLet me see if I can rewrite this equation to make it look more like a quadratic. If I let y = e^x, then e^(2x) would be (e^x)^2, which is y^2. So, substituting y into the equation, I get:\n\ny^2 - 5y + 6 = 0\n\nOh, that's much better! Now it's a straightforward quadratic equation. I can try to factor this.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. Let's see, -2 and -3 satisfy that because (-2) * (-3) = 6 and (-2) + (-3) = -5.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(y - 2)(y - 3) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives me the solutions for y:\n\ny - 2 = 0 => y = 2\n\ny - 3 = 0 => y = 3\n\nRemember that y = e^x, so now I have:\n\ne^x = 2 and e^x = 3\n\nTo solve for x, I can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides because ln(e^x) = x.\n\nSo, for e^x = 2:\n\nln(e^x) = ln(2)\n\nx = ln(2)\n\nAnd for e^x = 3:\n\nln(e^x) = ln(3)\n\nx = ln(3)\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation are x = ln(2) and x = ln(3).\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation:\n\ne^(2x) - 5e^x + 6 = 0\n\nLet's substitute x = ln(2):\n\ne^(2*ln(2)) - 5e^(ln(2)) + 6 = e^(ln(4)) - 5*2 + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0\n\nGood, that checks out.\n\nNow, substitute x = ln(3):\n\ne^(2*ln(3)) - 5e^(ln(3)) + 6 = e^(ln(9)) - 5*3 + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0\n\nPerfect, that works too.\n\nI think that's the correct solution. So, the final answer is x = ln(2) and x = ln(3).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\ln 2 \\text{ and } \\ln 3} \\]"
