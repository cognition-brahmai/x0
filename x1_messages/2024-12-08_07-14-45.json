They allow geographers to capture, store, manipulate, and analyze spatial and geographic data. This technology can be used to study a wide range of topics, from environmental conservation to urban planning. For instance, a GIS might be used to map the spread of a disease in a city, helping public health officials target interventions. Based on this, which of the following would be an appropriate use of GIS?\nA. Calculating the speed of light\nB. Studying the behavior of subatomic particles\nC. Mapping the distribution of a particular species in a national park\nD. Analyzing the themes of a novel\nE. None of the above"

        "content": "GIS is indeed a versatile tool that finds applications across various fields, especially where spatial data is involved. Let's break down the options to see which one aligns best with the capabilities of GIS.\n\nOption A: Calculating the speed of light. This seems more related to physics and experimental measurements rather than spatial analysis. GIS isn't typically used for such calculations.\n\nOption B: Studying the behavior of subatomic particles. Again, this falls under the realm of physics, specifically particle physics, which doesn't directly involve geographic or spatial data in the way GIS does.\n\nOption C: Mapping the distribution of a particular species in a national park. This sounds like a perfect fit for GIS. Geographers and ecologists can use GIS to analyze where species are located, identify patterns in their distribution, and understand factors that influence their habitats. This kind of spatial analysis is fundamental in environmental conservation and management.\n\nOption D: Analyzing the themes of a novel. This seems more related to literary analysis or text mining, which might use different kinds of software and methods not typically associated with GIS.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C appears to be the most appropriate use of GIS among the choices provided. It directly involves spatial data and geographic analysis, which are the core strengths of GIS technology.\n\nHowever, to ensure completeness, let's consider if any other options could potentially involve GIS in some way.\n\nFor example, while option A is primarily a physics problem, one might imagine a scenario where the speed of light is measured across different geographic locations, and GIS could be used to map variations. But this seems like a stretch and not the primary use of GIS.\n\nSimilarly, option B might involve mapping the locations of particle accelerators or analyzing geographical data related to particle physics experiments, but again, this isn't the core function of GIS.\n\nOption D, analyzing themes of a novel, could perhaps involve mapping the settings of a story or the movement of characters, which might have some spatial components. However, this is more akin to literary geography and might not be the most typical use of GIS.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: Mapping the distribution of a particular species in a national park. This is a standard application of GIS in environmental science and geography.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
