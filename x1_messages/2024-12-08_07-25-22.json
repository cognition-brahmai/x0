        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling at different speeds for different durations, and I need to find its average speed for the entire trip. Okay, so the train first travels at 90 km/h for 4 hours, and then it slows down to 60 km/h for another 5 hours. I need to find the overall average speed.\n\nFirst, I recall that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I need to find the total distance the train traveled and the total time it took.\n\nLet me calculate the distance for each part of the trip separately. For the first part, at 90 km/h for 4 hours, the distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So, 90 km/h times 4 hours is 360 kilometers.\n\nThen, for the second part, at 60 km/h for 5 hours, the distance is 60 km/h times 5 hours, which is 300 kilometers.\n\nNow, the total distance is the sum of these two distances: 360 km plus 300 km equals 660 kilometers.\n\nThe total time is the sum of the two time periods: 4 hours plus 5 hours equals 9 hours.\n\nSo, the average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 660 km divided by 9 hours.\n\nLet me do that division: 660 divided by 9 is 73.333... km/h.\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire trip is approximately 73.3 km/h.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the weighted average of the speeds.\n\nI know that average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean of the speeds, because the train spent different amounts of time at each speed. So, the correct way is to use the total distance over total time, like I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the harmonic mean, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nLet me recall when to use the harmonic mean. The harmonic mean is used when dealing with rates and the average rate over the same distance. But in this case, the distances are different because the train traveled at different speeds for different times, not necessarily the same distance at each speed.\n\nSo, I think the total distance over total time is the correct approach.\n\nJust to double-check, let me see if I can get the same answer using another method.\n\nSuppose I consider the average speed as a weighted average, where the weights are the times spent at each speed.\n\nSo, the average speed would be (speed1 * time1 + speed2 * time2) / (time1 + time2).\n\nPlugging in the values: (90 * 4 + 60 * 5) / (4 + 5) = (360 + 300) / 9 = 660 / 9 = 73.3 km/h.\n\nOkay, that's the same answer I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to calculate it differently, say, by finding the average of the two speeds, that would be (90 + 60) / 2 = 75 km/h. But that's not correct in this scenario because the train spent more time at the slower speed.\n\nSince the train traveled for longer at 60 km/h (5 hours) than at 90 km/h (4 hours), the average speed should be closer to 60 km/h than to 90 km/h, which is what I calculated: 73.3 km/h.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 73.3 km/h is the correct average speed for the entire trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{73.\\overline{3} \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
