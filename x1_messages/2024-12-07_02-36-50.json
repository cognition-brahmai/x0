        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out the train's original speed. It travels 300 miles in 5 hours, so its speed is distance divided by time, right? So, 300 miles divided by 5 hours is 60 mph. Now, if it increases its speed by 10 mph, its new speed would be 60 plus 10, which is 70 mph. We need to find out how long it will take to travel the same 300 miles at this new speed. Time is distance divided by speed, so 300 miles divided by 70 mph. Let me calculate that: 300 divided by 70 is approximately 4.2857 hours. To make it more understandable, that's about 4 hours and 17 minutes. So, at the increased speed, it would take roughly 4 hours and 17 minutes to travel the same distance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.2857 \\text{ hours} \\approx 4 \\text{ hours and } 17 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
