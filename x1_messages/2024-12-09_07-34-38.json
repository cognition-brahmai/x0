It listens for messages and broadcasts them to other clients. If the client disconnects, it cleans up resources.\n   - **Constructor**: Sets up the server socket, binds it to the specified port, and starts listening for connections. For each new connection, it creates a new `Client` object and spawns a thread to handle that client.\n   - **Destructor**: Cleans up resources by joining threads and closing sockets.\n3. **main Function**: Creates an instance of `ChatServer`, which starts the server.\n\n### Compilation\n\nTo compile this program, you need a C++11 compatible compiler and the necessary network libraries. Use a command like:\n\n```sh\ng++ -o chat_server chat_server.cpp -std=c++11 -pthread\n```\n\n### Running\n\nRun the compiled program:\n\n```sh\n./chat_server\n```\n\nThis will start the server, which will listen on port 8080. You can connect to it using any TCP client, such as `telnet` or a custom client program.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a basic chat server in C++ that can handle multiple client connections, broadcast messages, and gracefully manage client disconnections, we can use socket programming along with threading. Below is a step-by-step guide and the corresponding code to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Server Setup**:\n   - Create a server socket and bind it to a specific port.\n   - Listen for incoming client connections.\n\n2. **Handling Multiple Clients**:\n   - Accept new client connections and assign each client to a separate thread to handle their communications independently.\n\n3. **Broadcasting Messages**:\n   - When a message is received from a client, broadcast it to all other connected clients.\n\n4. **Graceful Disconnection**:\n   - Handle client disconnections by removing them from the list of active clients and cleaning up resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <thread>\n#include <vector>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <netinet/in.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <sstream>\n\n#define PORT 8080\n#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024\n\nclass Client {\npublic:\n    int socket;\n    std::thread* thread;\n\n    Client(int sock) : socket(sock), thread(nullptr) {}\n};\n\nclass ChatServer {\nprivate:\n    int serverSocket;\n    std::vector<Client*> clients;\n\n    void broadcast(const std::string& message, Client* sender) {\n        for (auto client : clients) {\n            if (client != sender) {\n                send(client->socket, message.c_str(), message.size(), 0);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    void handleClient(Client* client) {\n        char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];\n        std::string message;\n        while (true) {\n            memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);\n            int bytesReceived = recv(client->socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);\n            if (bytesReceived <= 0) {\n                // Client disconnected\n                close(client->socket);\n                clients.erase(std::remove(clients.begin(), clients.end(), client), clients.end());\n                delete client;\n                std::cout << \"Client disconnected\" << std::endl;\n                return;\n            }\n            message = buffer;\n            std::cout << \"Received: \" << message << std::endl;\n            broadcast(message, client);\n        }\n    }\n\npublic:\n    ChatServer() {\n        serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);\n        if (serverSocket == -1) {\n            std::cerr << \"Failed to create socket\" << std::endl;\n            exit(1);\n        }\n\n        struct sockaddr_in serverAddr;\n        serverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;\n        serverAddr.sin_port = htons(PORT);\n        serverAddr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;\n\n        if (bind(serverSocket, (struct sockaddr *)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr)) == -1) {\n            std::cerr << \"Bind failed\" << std::endl;\n            close(serverSocket);\n            exit(1);\n        }\n\n        if (listen(serverSocket, 3) == -1) {\n            std::cerr << \"Listen failed\" << std::endl;\n            close(serverSocket);\n            exit(1);\n        }\n\n        std::cout << \"Server listening on port \" << PORT << std::endl;\n\n        while (true) {\n            struct sockaddr_in clientAddr;\n            socklen_t addrSize = sizeof(clientAddr);\n            int clientSocket = accept(serverSocket, (struct sockaddr *)&clientAddr, &addrSize);\n            if (clientSocket == -1) {\n                std::cerr << \"Accept failed\" << std::endl;\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            Client* newClient = new Client(clientSocket);\n            clients.push_back(newClient);\n\n            std::cout << \"New client connected\" << std::endl;\n\n            newClient->thread = new std::thread(&ChatServer::handleClient, this, newClient);\n        }\n    }\n\n    ~ChatServer() {\n        for (auto client : clients) {\n            if (client->thread->joinable()) {\n                client->thread->join();\n            }\n            delete client->thread;\n            close(client->socket);\n            delete client;\n        }\n        close(serverSocket);\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    ChatServer server;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Client Class**:\n   - Represents a connected client with a socket and a thread.\n\n2. **ChatServer Class**:\n   - **broadcast**: Sends a message to all connected clients except the sender.\n   - **handleClient**: Manages communication with a single client.
