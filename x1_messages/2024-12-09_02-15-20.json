        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there's a father with three sons, and we need to find out their ages based on some relationships between their ages and the sum of their ages.\n\nFirst, let's assign some variables to make this easier. Let's say the middle son's age is M years. Then, according to the problem:\n\n- The youngest son is half the age of the middle son, so his age would be M/2.\n\n- The oldest son is twice the age of the middle son, so his age would be 2M.\n\nNow, the sum of their ages is 42 years. So, if we add up the ages of all three sons, it should equal 42.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nYoungest son's age + Middle son's age + Oldest son's age = 42\n\nSubstituting the variables we assigned:\n\nM/2 + M + 2M = 42\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. First, let's find a common denominator to make adding easier. Since M/2 is involved, the common denominator is 2.\n\nSo, M/2 + M + 2M can be written as:\n\n(M/2) + (2M/2) + (4M/2) = 42\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n(M + 2M + 4M)/2 = 42\n\nThat's:\n\n7M/2 = 42\n\nNow, to solve for M, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n7M = 84\n\nThen, divide both sides by 7:\n\nM = 12\n\nSo, the middle son is 12 years old.\n\nNow, let's find the ages of the other two sons.\n\nYoungest son: M/2 = 12/2 = 6 years old\n\nOldest son: 2M = 2*12 = 24 years old\n\nLet's double-check to make sure the sum is 42:\n\n6 + 12 + 24 = 42\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the ages of the three sons are 6, 12, and 24 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6, 12, 24} \\]"
