COFFEE SHOP - DAY**\n\n*JASMINE (28, sharp, witty) and AMIR (28, laid-back, creative) sit at a table, sipping coffee.*\n\nJASMINE\nSo, what do you think? Should we really do this?\n\nAMIR\nWhy not? We solved that neighborhood mystery last week. People are already calling us detectives.\n\nJASMINE\nBut that was just a missing cat. Hardly Sherlock Holmes material.\n\nAMIR\nHey, every great detective starts somewhere. Besides, it'll be fun.\n\n*(JASMINE smiles, considering)*\n\nJASMINE\nAlright, but let's keep it small. Part-time, maybe weekend gigs.\n\nAMIR\nDeal.\n\n**INT. JASMINE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY**\n\n*JASMINE is on her laptop, designing a logo. AMIR is setting up a small office space.*\n\nJASMINE\nOkay, I've got the logo. \"J&A Detectives.\" Simple yet effective.\n\nAMIR\nPerfect. Now, we need a website. I can handle that.\n\nJASMINE\nAnd business cards. Maybe some detective-themed mugs for the office.\n\nAMIR\n*(laughs)* Detective mugs? You're going all out.\n\nJASMINE\nWhy not? It's our agency.\n\n**EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PARK - DAY**\n\n*JASMINE and AMIR are walking, discussing their first case.*\n\nJASMINE\nSo, Mrs. Thompson wants to know who's been stealing her newspaper every morning.\n\nAMIR\nSounds exciting.\n\nJASMINE\n*(sarcastically)* Oh, definitely. The life of a private investigator.\n\nAMIR\nEvery case is a mystery waiting to be solved.\n\n*(They both laugh)*\n\n**INT. MRS. THOMPSON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY**\n\n*MRS. THOMPSON (60s, friendly) sits in her living room.*\n\nMRS. THOMPSON\nThank you both for coming. I've been so frustrated. Every morning, my newspaper is gone before I wake up.\n\nJASMINE\nWe'll do our best to solve this for you, Mrs. Thompson.\n\nAMIR\nDon't worry; we've got this.\n\n**EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING - DAY**\n\n*JASMINE and AMIR are hiding behind bushes, spying on MRS. THOMPSON's house.*\n\nAMIR\nOkay, it's 6:30. According to Mrs. Thompson, the thief strikes around now.\n\nJASMINE\nGot my notebook ready.\n\n*(They wait)*\n\n**CUT TO:**\n\n*A figure in a hoodie approaches MRS. THOMPSON's house, picks up the newspaper, and runs off.*\n\nJASMINE\nGot 'em!\n\nAMIR\nWait, let's see who it is.\n\n*They chase after the figure, turning a corner.*\n\n**EXT. LOCAL LIBRARY - DAY**\n\n*The hoodie Figure enters the library and removes the hood, revealing it to be SAM (10, curious).*\n\nJASMINE\nSam? What are you doing with Mrs. Thompson's newspaper?\n\nSAM\nI, uh, I needed to look up some information for my school project. I didn't want to bother her.\n\nAMIR\nSo, you've been taking her newspaper?\n\nSAM\nOnly the comics section. I promise I'll return them all.\n\nJASMINE\n*(softening)* Look, Sam, you should ask permission first. But since you've been using them for school, maybe Mrs. Thompson won't mind.\n\nAMIR\nBut next time, please ask her. Okay?\n\nSAM\nOkay, I promise.\n\n**INT. MRS. THOMPSON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY**\n\n*JASMINE and AMIR explain the situation to MRS. THOMPSON.*\n\nMRS. THOMPSON\nOh, poor thing. He must have been desperate. I'll speak to him and his parents.\n\nJASMINE\nWe can arrange a meeting if you like.\n\nMRS. THOMPSON\nThat would be wonderful. Thank you both so much.\n\n**INT. JASMINE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT**\n\n*JASMINE and AMIR are celebrating with drinks.*\n\nJASMINE\nOur first case, and we solved it without any real detective work.\n\nAMIR\nBut we did solve it. And Mrs. Thompson was happy.\n\nJASMINE\nYeah, and Sam gets to keep his comics habit.\n\nAMIR\n*(laughs)* The life of a private investigator.\n\nJASMINE\nWho knows what our next case will bring?\n\nAMIR\nAs long as it's not another missing newspaper.\n\nJASMINE\n*(smirks)* Cross your fingers.\n\n**FADE OUT.**\n\n**THE END**"
