        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 3x - 7 = 11. I need to find out what x is. Alright, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the goal is to isolate x on one side of the equation. That means I need to get rid of any numbers added to or subtracted from x, and also account for any coefficients multiplied by x.\n\nLooking at the equation, 3x - 7 = 11, I see that x is being multiplied by 3 and then 7 is being subtracted. To isolate x, I need to undo these operations.\n\nI think I should start by dealing with the subtraction first. So, there's a -7 in the equation. To cancel that out, I can add 7 to both sides of the equation. That way, the -7 and +7 will cancel each other out on the left side.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n3x = 18\n\nOkay, now x is being multiplied by 3. To isolate x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 3.\n\nSo:\n\n3x / 3 = 18 / 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 6\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check by plugging the value back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x - 7 = 11\n\nPlugging in x = 6:\n\n3*(6) - 7 = 18 - 7 = 11\n\nYes, that matches the right side of the equation. So, x = 6 is the correct solution.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to solve this equation. Maybe I could start by dividing both sides by 3 first, instead of adding 7.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nOriginal equation: 3x - 7 = 11\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n(3x - 7)/3 = 11/3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx - 7/3 = 11/3\n\nNow, to isolate x, I can add 7/3 to both sides:\n\nx - 7/3 + 7/3 = 11/3 + 7/3\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx = 18/3\n\nSimplify 18/3:\n\nx = 6\n\nAgain, I get x = 6. So, regardless of the order in which I perform the operations, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. But maybe there's a chance I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me verify the arithmetic operations.\n\nFirst method:\n\n1. Added 7 to both sides: 3x - 7 + 7 = 3x = 11 + 7 = 18\n\n2. Divided both sides by 3: 3x/3 = x = 18/3 = 6\n\nSecond method:\n\n1. Divided both sides by 3: (3x - 7)/3 = x - 7/3 = 11/3\n\n2. Added 7/3 to both sides: x = 11/3 + 7/3 = 18/3 = 6\n\nBoth methods confirm that x = 6.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll plug x = 6 back into the original equation once more.\n\n3*(6) - 7 = 18 - 7 = 11\n\nYes, it matches the right side of the equation.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this equation and confirmed the solution. x = 6 is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
