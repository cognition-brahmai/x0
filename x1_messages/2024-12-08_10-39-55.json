        "content": "So if every cat has 4 legs, and you've counted 80 legs, how many cats is that? Hmm, this seems like a straightforward division problem. So, if each cat has 4 legs, then the total number of legs would be 4 times the number of cats. So, if I let the number of cats be C, then 4 times C equals 80. So, 4C = 80. To find C, I just need to divide both sides by 4. So, C = 80 divided by 4, which is 20. So, there are 20 cats.\n\nBut wait, is there any other way to think about this? Maybe considering that some cats might have fewer or more legs, but the problem says every cat has 4 legs, so I don't need to worry about that. So, yeah, it's straightforward. 80 legs divided by 4 legs per cat equals 20 cats.\n\nJust to double-check, if I have 20 cats and each has 4 legs, then 20 times 4 is indeed 80. So, that makes sense. I don't think there's anything else to consider here. The answer is 20 cats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
