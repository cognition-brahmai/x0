        "content": "So the online retailer wants to add 1,000 new items to their inventory. Each item costs $25 wholesale and needs $5 in packaging materials. They're going to store these in a warehouse that costs $0.10 per square foot per month, and each item takes up 2 square feet of space. I need to calculate two things: the monthly rent for the warehouse and the initial investment required to add these new products.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the warehouse rent. Each item occupies 2 square feet, so for 1,000 items, the total space needed is:\n\n1,000 items * 2 sq ft/item = 2,000 sq ft\n\nThe warehouse costs $0.10 per square foot per month, so the monthly rent is:\n\n2,000 sq ft * $0.10/sq ft/month = $200/month\n\nNow, for the initial investment, that would be the cost to purchase the items and the packaging materials. Each item costs $25, and each requires $5 in packaging, so per item, the cost is:\n\n$25 + $5 = $30 per item\n\nFor 1,000 items, the total initial investment is:\n\n1,000 items * $30/item = $30,000\n\nSo, the monthly warehouse rent is $200, and the initial investment to add these new products is $30,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Monthly warehouse rent: } \\$200, \\text{ Initial investment: } \\$30,000} \\]"
