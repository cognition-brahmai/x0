        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, the factory produces 500 units of product X each day, and each unit sells for $10. So, daily revenue would be 500 units times $10 per unit, which is $5,000 per day.\n\nNext, the factory operates 6 days a week. So, weekly production and revenue would be 6 days times $5,000, which equals $30,000 per week.\n\nNow, about the maintenance breaks. The factory takes 2 weeks off per year for maintenance. That means it doesn't operate for 2 weeks each year.\n\nTypically, there are 52 weeks in a year. If the factory takes 2 weeks off, it operates for 52 - 2 = 50 weeks per year.\n\nSo, annual revenue would be 50 weeks times $30,000 per week, which equals $1,500,000 per year.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, the factory operates 6 days a week for 50 weeks a year. So, total operating days in a year would be 6 days/week times 50 weeks/year, which is 300 days/year.\n\nAt 500 units per day, total units produced and sold in a year would be 300 days times 500 units/day, equaling 150,000 units per year.\n\nAt $10 per unit, annual revenue would be 150,000 units times $10/unit, which is indeed $1,500,000 per year.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems consistent.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect the annual revenue.\n\nAre there any holidays or additional days off not accounted for in the 2 weeks of maintenance? The problem states that the factory operates 6 days a week and takes 2 weeks off per year for maintenance, so I think the 50 weeks of operation is accurate.\n\nIs there any information about production increases or decreases over time? No, the production rate is constant at 500 units per day.\n\nIs there any information about price changes? No, each unit sells for a steady $10.\n\nSo, based on the given information, the annual revenue from selling product X is $1,500,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1500000} \\]"
