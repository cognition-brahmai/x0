        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains moving towards each other from different stations, and I need to figure out if they'll meet before they reach their destinations. Let me see.\n\nFirst, train A is leaving from Station A heading to Station B, and it's going at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between Station A and Station B is 180 miles. At the same time, another train leaves from Station B heading towards Station A, and it's going at a constant speed of 90 miles per hour.\n\nSo, both trains are moving towards each other. I need to find out if they'll meet before either one reaches its destination.\n\nLet me think about this. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they approach each other. So, the relative speed is 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nNow, the distance between them is 180 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nSo, Time = 180 miles / 150 mph = 1.2 hours.\n\nSo, they will meet after 1.2 hours.\n\nNow, I need to check if either train reaches its destination before they meet.\n\nLet's see how far each train travels in 1.2 hours.\n\nTrain from A: 60 mph * 1.2 hours = 72 miles.\n\nTrain from B: 90 mph * 1.2 hours = 108 miles.\n\nNow, Station B is 180 miles from A, so train A has 180 - 72 = 108 miles left to go to reach Station B when they meet.\n\nSimilarly, train B has traveled 108 miles towards A, so it has 180 - 108 = 72 miles left to go to reach Station A.\n\nSo, neither train has reached its destination when they meet.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether they meet before reaching their destinations. Well, they meet after traveling for 1.2 hours, and at that point, neither has reached the other's station, since they both still have some distance left to travel.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider if they reach their destinations before meeting.\n\nWait, no. They meet after 1.2 hours, and at that point, neither has reached the other's destination, as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the time it would take for each train to reach the other's destination.\n\nTrain from A to reach Station B: 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours.\n\nTrain from B to reach Station A: 180 miles / 90 mph = 2 hours.\n\nBut they meet after 1.2 hours, which is less than both 2 hours and 3 hours. So, yes, they meet before either one reaches its destination.\n\nWait, but the question is a bit tricky because it says \"will they meet before reaching their destinations?\" It might be interpreted as whether both trains reach their destinations before meeting each other, which doesn't make much sense because if they meet, they haven't reached their destinations yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking if they meet before each would have reached their respective destinations if traveling alone.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, they're traveling towards each other, so they will meet somewhere in between before either reaches the other's station.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose train A travels alone for 3 hours to reach Station B. Train B travels alone for 2 hours to reach Station A. But since they're moving towards each other, they will meet sooner, at 1.2 hours, as calculated.\n\nSo, yes, they meet before either would have reached the other's destination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is whether they meet before each would have reached their own destination, but in this case, they're traveling towards each other, so they don't have their own destinations to reach unless they pass each other.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me rephrase: do they meet each other before either train has reached its destination.\n\nFrom the calculations, they meet after 1.2 hours, at which point train A has traveled 72 miles and train B has traveled 108 miles. So, train A still has 108 miles to go, and train B has 72 miles to go.\n\nSince neither has reached the other's destination, the answer is yes, they meet before reaching their destinations.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is whether they meet before each would have reached the other's destination individually, that's a different matter.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider if one train reaches its destination before the other, but in this case, since they're moving towards each other, they will meet before either reaches the other's destination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think about it differently. The time to meet is 1.2 hours, as calculated earlier.\n\nTrain A takes 3 hours to reach Station B, and Train B takes 2 hours to reach Station A.\n\nSince 1.2 hours is less than both 2 hours and 3 hours, they will meet before either reaches its destination.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, they will meet before reaching their destinations.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the distance each train covers per hour.\n\nTrain A: 60 miles per hour.\n\nTrain B: 90 miles per hour.\n\nTogether, they cover 60 + 90 = 150 miles per hour.\n\nTotal distance is 180 miles.\n\nSo, time to meet is 180 / 150 = 1.2 hours.\n\nNow, in 1.2 hours, Train A has covered 60 * 1.2 = 72 miles, and Train B has covered 90 * 1.2 = 108 miles.\n\nSo, they meet at a point where Train A has covered 72 miles from Station A, and Train B has covered 108 miles from Station B.\n\nSince Train A has only covered 72 miles, it hasn't reached Station B (which is 180 miles away). Similarly, Train B has covered 108 miles, which is also less than 180 miles, so it hasn't reached Station A.\n\nTherefore, they meet before either reaches its destination.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the remaining distance after meeting:\n\nTrain A has 180 - 72 = 108 miles left to Station B.\n\nTrain B has 180 - 108 = 72 miles left to Station A.\n\nSo, neither has reached its destination.\n\nHence, the answer is yes, they will meet before reaching their destinations.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider the time each would take to reach the meeting point from their starting points.\n\nTime for Train A to meet: 72 miles / 60 mph = 1.2 hours.\n\nTime for Train B to meet: 108 miles / 90 mph = 1.2 hours.\n\nSo, both arrive at the meeting point at the same time, 1.2 hours after starting.\n\nAnd the time for Train A to reach Station B: 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours.\n\nTime for Train B to reach Station A: 180 miles / 90 mph = 2 hours.\n\nSince 1.2 hours is less than both 2 hours and 3 hours, they meet before either reaches its destination.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, they will meet before reaching their destinations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, they will meet before reaching their destinations.}} \\]"
