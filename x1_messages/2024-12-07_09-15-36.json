        "content": "So I have this probability problem here. There's a box with 3 red balls and 2 green balls, making a total of 5 balls. I need to find the probability of drawing one ball of each color when I draw two balls at random without replacement.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a ball, I don't put it back into the box before drawing the second ball. So the total number of balls decreases after the first draw.\n\nOkay, so the total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 5. I think I need to use combinations here because the order doesn't matter. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 5 is calculated using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 5 is:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 possible pairs of balls that can be drawn.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the pairs that have one red and one green ball.\n\nThere are 3 red balls and 2 green balls.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red ball out of three is:\n\n\\[\nC(3, 1) = \\frac{3!}{1!(3 - 1)!} = \\frac{6}{1 \\times 2} = 3\n\\]\n\nThe number of ways to choose one green ball out of two is:\n\n\\[\nC(2, 1) = \\frac{2!}{1!(2 - 1)!} = \\frac{2}{1 \\times 1} = 2\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the product of these two, because for each red ball chosen, there are two green balls that can be paired with it.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable outcomes} = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one of each color}) = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nWait, but probabilities are usually given as fractions, so maybe it's better to leave it as \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using probabilities directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the problem step by step.\n\nFirst draw: The probability of drawing a red ball first is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\), and then drawing a green ball second is \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) because there are 2 green balls left out of 4 total balls.\n\nSo, the probability of red then green is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing a green ball first is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\), and then drawing a red ball second is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) because there are 3 red balls left out of 4 total balls.\n\nSo, the probability of green then red is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{20} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events (either red then green or green then red), I can add their probabilities to get the total probability of drawing one of each color.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one of each color}) = \\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nSo, this matches the earlier result of \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) or 0.6.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the concept of combinations directly in probability.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red and one green is \\( C(3,1) \\times C(2,1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\), as before.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any two balls is \\( C(5,2) = 10 \\).\n\nSo again, the probability is \\( \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach.\n\nSuppose I use the concept of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability of drawing one of each color can be thought of as the probability of drawing a red ball given that the first ball was red, plus the probability of drawing a green ball given that the first ball was green.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nActually, conditional probability here would involve considering the probability of the second draw given the first.\n\nBut I think the method I used earlier is sufficient and correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the total probability theorem, but in this simple case, it's not necessary.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of drawing one ball of each color is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
