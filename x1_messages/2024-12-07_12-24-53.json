        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total. Out of these, 20 play soccer, 15 play basketball, and 8 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many students play at least one of the two sports. Since some students play both sports, I can't just add the number of soccer players and basketball players together because that would count the students who play both sports twice.\n\nSo, I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That means I add the number of soccer players and the number of basketball players, and then subtract the number of students who play both sports to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet's do that:\n\nNumber of students who play soccer or basketball = (number who play soccer) + (number who play basketball) - (number who play both)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 20 + 15 - 8\n= 35 - 8\n= 27\n\nSo, 27 students play at least one of the two sports.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I subtract the number of students who play at least one sport from the total number of students.\n\nNumber of students who don't play either sport = total students - students who play at least one sport\n\n= 30 - 27\n= 3\n\nTherefore, 3 students don't play either soccer or basketball.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to use a Venn diagram. Let's visualize this.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players.\n\n- The number of students who play only soccer would be total soccer players minus those who play both sports: 20 - 8 = 12.\n\n- The number of students who play only basketball would be total basketball players minus those who play both sports: 15 - 8 = 7.\n\n- The number of students who play both sports is 8.\n\nSo, adding up those who play only soccer, only basketball, and both:\n\n12 (only soccer) + 7 (only basketball) + 8 (both) = 27 students.\n\nAgain, that's 27 students who play at least one sport.\n\nTotal students are 30, so 30 - 27 = 3 students don't play either sport.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number of students who play soccer (20)\n\n- n(B) is the number of students who play basketball (15)\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number of students who play both sports (8)\n\nSo, n(A \u222a B) = 20 + 15 - 8 = 27\n\nAgain, this matches the previous result.\n\nTo find the number of students who don't play either sport, I subtract the number who play at least one sport from the total:\n\n30 - 27 = 3\n\nI think this is correct. But to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of error in this approach.\n\nOne thing to consider is whether there are students who play neither sport. The problem states that there are students who play soccer, basketball, and both, but it doesn't explicitly say whether there are students who play neither. However, since the total adds up to 27 out of 30, it implies that 3 students do not play either sport.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the complement. The complement of students who play at least one sport is those who play neither. So, if 27 students play at least one sport, then the remaining students play neither.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation.\n\nLet:\n\n- Total students = 30\n\n- Soccer players = 20\n\n- Basketball players = 15\n\n- Both sports = 8\n\n- Neither sport = x\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nSoccer + Basketball - Both + Neither = Total\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n20 + 15 - 8 + x = 30\n\n35 - 8 + x = 30\n\n27 + x = 30\n\nx = 30 - 27\n\nx = 3\n\nAgain, this confirms that 3 students play neither sport.\n\nI think this is solid. I've used multiple methods to arrive at the same answer, which increases my confidence in the result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might have been missed. For example, are there students who play other sports not mentioned here? The problem only mentions soccer and basketball, so I think it's safe to assume that the only sports being considered are these two.\n\nAlso, the problem states that 8 students play both soccer and basketball, which is already accounted for in the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether some students might be playing neither sport. The problem doesn't provide any information about students playing neither, but based on the numbers, it's logical to conclude that there are 3 such students.\n\nAlternatively, if there were students who play only one sport and some who play neither, the numbers should still add up correctly.\n\nGiven all this, I'm confident that the answer is 3 students don't play either soccer or basketball.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
