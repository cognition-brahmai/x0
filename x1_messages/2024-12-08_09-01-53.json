To create a simple Node.js application that listens on a specified port and responds with the current date and time in JSON format, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your project directory:**\n   Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir node-time-server\n   cd node-time-server\n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize a new Node.js project:**\n   Run the following command to create a `package.json` file.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n3. **Install necessary dependencies:**\n   For this simple application, you'll need the `express` framework to handle HTTP requests easily.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install express\n   ```\n\n4. **Create the server file:**\n   Create a new file named `server.js` in your project directory.\n\n5. **Write the server code:**\n   Open `server.js` and add the following code:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const app = express();\n   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; // You can specify the port here or use an environment variable\n\n   app.get('/', (req, res) => {\n       const currentTime = new Date();\n       res.json({ \"currentDateTime\": currentTime.toISOString() });\n   });\n\n   app.listen(port, () => {\n       console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n6. **Run the server:**\n   Execute the following command in your terminal to start the server.\n\n   ```bash\n   node server.js\n   ```\n\n   You should see the message \"Server is running on port 3000\" (or whichever port you specified).\n\n7. **Test the application:**\n   Open a web browser or use a tool like `curl` or Postman to make a GET request to `http://localhost:3000`. You should receive a JSON response containing the current date and time.\n\n   Example response:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"currentDateTime\": \"2023-04-10T12:34:56.789Z\"\n   }\n   ```\n\nThat's it! You've created a basic Node.js application that serves the current date and time in JSON format. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
