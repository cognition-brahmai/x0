        "content": "So I have this problem: If a car factory produces 15 cars every hour, how many cars will it produce in a year? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to know how many hours there are in a year because the factory's production rate is given per hour. So, let's start by figuring out the number of hours in a year.\n\nI know that there are 24 hours in a day and 365 days in a year. But wait, every four years there's a leap year with an extra day, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume it's a non-leap year to keep things simple.\n\nSo, hours in a year = 24 hours/day \u00d7 365 days/year.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n24 \u00d7 365.\n\nWell, 24 \u00d7 300 = 7200.\n\n24 \u00d7 65 = 1560.\n\nSo, 7200 + 1560 = 8760 hours in a year.\n\nNow, the factory produces 15 cars every hour. So, to find out how many cars are produced in a year, I need to multiply the number of cars produced per hour by the number of hours in a year.\n\nSo, total cars produced in a year = 15 cars/hour \u00d7 8760 hours/year.\n\nLet's do that multiplication:\n\n15 \u00d7 8760.\n\nWell, 10 \u00d7 8760 = 87,600.\n\nAnd 5 \u00d7 8760 = 43,800.\n\nSo, 87,600 + 43,800 = 131,400 cars per year.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, hours in a year: 24 \u00d7 365.\n\n24 \u00d7 300 = 7200.\n\n24 \u00d7 65: 24 \u00d7 60 = 1440, plus 24 \u00d7 5 = 120, so 1440 + 120 = 1560.\n\nTotal hours: 7200 + 1560 = 8760. Okay, that checks out.\n\nNow, 15 cars per hour times 8760 hours:\n\n10 \u00d7 8760 = 87,600.\n\n5 \u00d7 8760 = 43,800.\n\nAdding them up: 87,600 + 43,800 = 131,400.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider if the factory operates 24/7. Maybe it doesn't run all hours of the day. Maybe there are maintenance breaks or shutdowns.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify, so I have to assume that the factory operates continuously every hour of the year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory only operates during standard business hours, say 8 hours a day.\n\nBut again, the problem states \"produces 15 cars every hour,\" without any qualifiers about operating hours, so I think it's safe to assume it's producing cars every hour it's operational, and that operational time is all hours of the year.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 131,400 cars per year.\n\nWait, but let's think about it in a different way to verify.\n\nIf the factory produces 15 cars per hour, and there are 8760 hours in a year, then 15 \u00d7 8760 should indeed be 131,400.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of days.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day, so daily production would be 15 cars/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day = 360 cars/day.\n\nThen, over 365 days, total production would be 360 cars/day \u00d7 365 days/year.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n360 \u00d7 365.\n\n360 \u00d7 300 = 108,000.\n\n360 \u00d7 65 = 23,400.\n\nTotal: 108,000 + 23,400 = 131,400 cars per year.\n\nSame answer as before, so that gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider weeks:\n\nThere are 24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 168 hours/week.\n\nProduction per week: 15 cars/hour \u00d7 168 hours/week = 2,520 cars/week.\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year, so 2,520 \u00d7 52.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n2,520 \u00d7 50 = 126,000.\n\n2,520 \u00d7 2 = 5,040.\n\nTotal: 126,000 + 5,040 = 131,040.\n\nWait, that's different from 131,400.\n\nHmm, why the discrepancy?\n\nOh, I see. There are actually 52.142857 weeks in a year, since 365 \u00f7 7 \u2248 52.142857.\n\nSo, 2,520 cars/week \u00d7 52.142857 weeks/year \u2248 131,400 cars/year.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the difference is due to the fact that 52 weeks only account for 364 days, and there's one extra day in a non-leap year.\n\nSo, 2,520 \u00d7 52 = 131,040.\n\nPlus one additional day's production: 360 cars.\n\nTotal: 131,040 + 360 = 131,400 cars per year.\n\nThere we go, all methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 131,400 cars in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{131400} \\]"
