        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a construction company bidding on a shopping mall project. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the mall has three floors, each with a total area of 150,000 square feet. So, the total area to be constructed would be 3 floors times 150,000 square feet per floor. That should be 3 * 150,000 = 450,000 square feet.\n\nNext, the construction costs are estimated at $125 per square foot. So, the total construction cost would be 450,000 square feet times $125 per square foot. That's 450,000 * 125. Let me calculate that: 450,000 * 125 = 56,250,000 dollars.\n\nThen, there are additional expenses: architectural fees of $50,000, permits and licenses of $25,000, and landscaping of $75,000. So, the total additional expenses would be 50,000 + 25,000 + 75,000. That's 150,000 dollars.\n\nNow, to get the total cost of the project, I need to add the construction costs and the additional expenses together. So, 56,250,000 + 150,000 = 56,400,000 dollars.\n\nThe company wants to yield a 20% profit margin on this project. So, to find the minimum bid amount that would give them a 20% profit, I need to calculate 120% of the total cost. Because 100% is the total cost, and they want an additional 20% profit.\n\nSo, the minimum bid amount would be 120% of 56,400,000 dollars. To calculate that, I can multiply 56,400,000 by 1.20.\n\nLet me do that: 56,400,000 * 1.20 = 67,680,000 dollars.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total area: 3 floors * 150,000 sq ft = 450,000 sq ft. That seems right.\n\nConstruction cost: 450,000 sq ft * $125/sq ft = $56,250,000. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAdditional expenses: $50,000 + $25,000 + $75,000 = $150,000. That's fine.\n\nTotal cost: $56,250,000 + $150,000 = $56,400,000. Correct.\n\nNow, to get a 20% profit, they need to make 120% of the total cost.\n\nSo, 120% of $56,400,000 is indeed $56,400,000 * 1.20 = $67,680,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the profit amount first: 20% of $56,400,000 is $11,280,000, and then add that to the total cost: $56,400,000 + $11,280,000 = $67,680,000.\n\nEither way, I end up with the same amount.\n\nSo, the minimum bid amount should be $67,680,000 to achieve a 20% profit margin.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me just make sure there aren't any other costs or factors I'm missing.\n\nThe problem mentions construction costs per square foot and additional fixed expenses, and I've included all of them in the total cost. The profit calculation seems straightforward: aiming for 20% above the total cost.\n\nYes, I believe $67,680,000 is the correct minimum bid amount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{67680000} \\]"
