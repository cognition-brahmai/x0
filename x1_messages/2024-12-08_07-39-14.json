        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A construction company is building a new residential complex with 200 apartments, each averaging 1,500 square feet. They need to finish the flooring within 30 days, and they're figuring out how many workers they need to get the job done. Each worker can do 100 square feet of flooring in 10 hours. And they're working 8 hours a day. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total flooring area that needs to be covered. Since there are 200 apartments and each is 1,500 square feet, the total area is:\n\n200 apartments * 1,500 sq ft/apartment = 300,000 sq ft\n\nSo, 300,000 square feet of flooring needs to be done.\n\nNext, I need to understand the rate at which one worker can complete the flooring. The problem says it takes one worker 10 hours to complete 100 square feet. So, their rate is:\n\n100 sq ft / 10 hours = 10 sq ft per hour per worker\n\nAlright, so each worker can do 10 square feet per hour.\n\nNow, they have a 30-day deadline, and each worker works 8 hours a day. So, the total number of hours one worker can work in 30 days is:\n\n30 days * 8 hours/day = 240 hours per worker\n\nSince each worker can do 10 sq ft per hour, in 240 hours, one worker can complete:\n\n10 sq ft/hour * 240 hours = 2,400 sq ft\n\nSo, one worker can cover 2,400 square feet in 30 days.\n\nNow, the total area to be covered is 300,000 sq ft, and one worker can do 2,400 sq ft in that time. So, the number of workers needed is:\n\n300,000 sq ft / 2,400 sq ft/worker = 125 workers\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of total man-hours required.\n\nFirst, find out how many man-hours are needed to complete the entire flooring.\n\nSince one worker takes 10 hours to do 100 sq ft, their rate is 10 hours per 100 sq ft, which is 0.1 hours per sq ft.\n\nWait, no. Actually, 10 hours for 100 sq ft means 10 hours / 100 sq ft = 0.1 hours per sq ft.\n\nSo, for 300,000 sq ft, the total man-hours required would be:\n\n300,000 sq ft * 0.1 hours/sq ft = 30,000 hours\n\nNow, each worker works 8 hours a day for 30 days, which is 240 hours per worker, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the number of workers needed is:\n\n30,000 hours / 240 hours/worker = 125 workers\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any constraints or if there's a more efficient way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how much area can be covered per day by one worker and then see how much needs to be covered per day overall.\n\nEach worker can work 8 hours a day, and at 10 sq ft per hour, that's:\n\n8 hours/day * 10 sq ft/hour = 80 sq ft/day per worker\n\nThe total area is 300,000 sq ft, and the deadline is 30 days, so the required area to be covered per day is:\n\n300,000 sq ft / 30 days = 10,000 sq ft/day\n\nSo, to cover 10,000 sq ft per day, with each worker covering 80 sq ft/day, the number of workers needed is:\n\n10,000 sq ft/day / 80 sq ft/day/worker = 125 workers\n\nAgain, that's the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, are there any overlapping tasks or dependencies between different apartments? The problem doesn't specify anything about that, so I'll assume that the flooring in different apartments can be done independently.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any breaks or inefficiencies in the workday that might affect the total hours worked, but the problem states that each worker works 8 hours a day, so I'll take that at face value.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all workers start at the same time or if there's any staging of the workforce. But again, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that all workers start together and work concurrently.\n\nSo, based on these calculations, it seems that 125 workers are needed to complete the flooring within 30 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check the units to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal area: 200 apartments * 1,500 sq ft/apartment = 300,000 sq ft\n\nWorker rate: 100 sq ft in 10 hours \u2192 10 sq ft per hour\n\nHours per worker per day: 8 hours\n\nDays: 30\n\nSo, hours per worker per 30 days: 8 hours/day * 30 days = 240 hours\n\nArea per worker: 10 sq ft/hour * 240 hours = 2,400 sq ft\n\nTotal workers needed: 300,000 sq ft / 2,400 sq ft/worker = 125 workers\n\nAlternatively, total man-hours needed: 300,000 sq ft * (10 hours/100 sq ft) = 300,000 * 0.1 = 30,000 hours\n\nWorkers needed: 30,000 hours / 240 hours/worker = 125 workers\n\nOr, area per day required: 300,000 sq ft / 30 days = 10,000 sq ft/day\n\nArea per worker per day: 10 sq ft/hour * 8 hours = 80 sq ft/day\n\nWorkers needed: 10,000 sq ft/day / 80 sq ft/day/worker = 125 workers\n\nAll these methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 125 workers are needed.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I'll consider if the workers can work overtime or if there are any other factors that could affect the number of workers needed. But based on the information provided, assuming standard working hours and no overtime, 125 workers should suffice.\n\nSo, the final answer is 125 workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
