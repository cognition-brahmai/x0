        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"If a square has an area of 64 square units, what is the length of its diagonal?\" Okay, let's see. I know that the area of a square is given by the formula \\( A = s^2 \\), where \\( s \\) is the length of one side of the square. So, if the area is 64 square units, that means \\( s^2 = 64 \\). To find \\( s \\), I need to take the square root of both sides. So, \\( s = \\sqrt{64} = 8 \\) units.\n\nNow, I need to find the length of the diagonal. I recall that in a square, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the two sides of the square, and the diagonal is the hypotenuse of that triangle. So, I can use the Pythagorean theorem here, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the diagonal, and the other two sides are both of length \\( s = 8 \\) units.\n\nSo, let's denote the diagonal as \\( d \\). According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nd^2 = s^2 + s^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\nd^2 = 8^2 + 8^2 = 64 + 64 = 128\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( d \\), I need to take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{128}\n\\]\n\nHmm, \\( \\sqrt{128} \\). I can simplify that. I know that 128 can be factored into 64 times 2, and since 64 is a perfect square, I can take it out of the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{128} = \\sqrt{64 \\times 2} = \\sqrt{64} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal is \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\) units.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the properties of a square or some other formula? I remember that for a square, the relationship between the side length and the diagonal can also be expressed using the formula \\( d = s\\sqrt{2} \\). Let me check if that makes sense. Yes, that's derived from the Pythagorean theorem anyway, as we just did. So, plugging in \\( s = 8 \\):\n\n\\[\nd = 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. Good, it's consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to verify this? Maybe using trigonometry? In a square, all angles are 90 degrees, and the diagonals bisect the angles, making 45-degree angles. So, each triangle formed by a diagonal is a 45-45-90 triangle. In such triangles, the sides are in the ratio \\( 1 : 1 : \\sqrt{2} \\), where the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) times a leg. Since each leg is 8 units, the hypotenuse (diagonal) would be \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\) units, which again confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that the area could correspond to a different shape, or if there's any trick here. The problem specifically says it's a square, so I don't think that's the case. It's straightforward: given the area, find the side length, then use that to find the diagonal.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. Area is 64, side is \\( \\sqrt{64} = 8 \\), diagonal is \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\). Yeah, that seems solid.\n\nOne more thing: sometimes, people leave the answer in terms of square roots, but occasionally, they might want a decimal approximation. For example, \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is approximately 1.414, so \\( 8 \\times 1.414 = 11.312 \\) units. But since the problem doesn't specify, and since \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\) is an exact value, I think leaving it in that form is acceptable, maybe even preferable.\n\nIn conclusion, the length of the diagonal of a square with an area of 64 square units is \\( 8\\sqrt{2} \\) units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\sqrt{2}} \\]"
