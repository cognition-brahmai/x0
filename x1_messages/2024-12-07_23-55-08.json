        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming a committee with some specific constraints. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nWe have a group of 12 men and 9 women, and we need to form a committee of 7 people. The catch is that there must be at least 3 women on the committee. Okay, so I need to figure out how many different ways we can select these 7 people with that condition.\n\nFirst, I recall that when we're choosing people without any restrictions, it's just a combination problem. The number of ways to choose k people from a group of n is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). But here, there's a condition about having at least 3 women.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that in my committee of 7, there are at least 3 women. That means the possible distributions could be:\n\n- 3 women and 4 men\n\n- 4 women and 3 men\n\n- 5 women and 2 men\n\n- 6 women and 1 man\n\n- 7 women and 0 men\n\nI think that covers all the possibilities where there are at least 3 women.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the number of ways for each of these scenarios and then add them up to get the total number of possible committees.\n\nLet's start with the first one: 3 women and 4 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 women from 9: C(9, 3)\n\nNumber of ways to choose 4 men from 12: C(12, 4)\n\nThen, the total number of committees with 3 women and 4 men would be C(9, 3) * C(12, 4).\n\nSimilarly, for 4 women and 3 men:\n\nC(9, 4) * C(12, 3)\n\nFor 5 women and 2 men:\n\nC(9, 5) * C(12, 2)\n\nFor 6 women and 1 man:\n\nC(9, 6) * C(12, 1)\n\nAnd for 7 women and 0 men:\n\nC(9, 7) * C(12, 0)\n\nWait, but C(12, 0) would just be 1, since there's only one way to choose nothing.\n\nNow, I need to calculate each of these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(9, 3):\n\n9! / (3! * (9 - 3)!) = (9*8*7*6!) / (6 * 3!) = (9*8*7) / (6*2) = (504) / 12 = 42\n\nAnd C(12, 4):\n\n12! / (4! * 8!) = (12*11*10*9*8!) / (24 * 8!) = (12*11*10*9) / 24 = (11880) / 24 = 495\n\nSo, C(9, 3) * C(12, 4) = 42 * 495 = let's see, 40 * 495 is 19800, and 2 * 495 is 990, so total 20790.\n\nOkay, that's for 3 women and 4 men.\n\nNext, 4 women and 3 men:\n\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4! * 5!) = (9*8*7*6*5!) / (24 * 5!) = (9*8*7*6) / 24 = (3024) / 24 = 126\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * 9!) = (12*11*10*9!) / (6 * 9!) = (12*11*10) / 6 = (1320) / 6 = 220\n\nSo, 126 * 220 = let's calculate that. 100 * 220 is 22,000, and 26 * 220 is 5,720, so total 27,720.\n\nAlright, that's for 4 women and 3 men.\n\nNow, 5 women and 2 men:\n\nC(9, 5) = C(9, 4), since C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). So, C(9, 5) = 126\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * 10!) = (12*11*10!) / (2 * 10!) = (12*11) / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66\n\nSo, 126 * 66 = let's see, 100 * 66 is 6,600, and 26 * 66 is 1,716, so total 8,316.\n\nOkay, that's for 5 women and 2 men.\n\nNext, 6 women and 1 man:\n\nC(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = 42\n\nC(12, 1) = 12\n\nSo, 42 * 12 = 504\n\nGot it.\n\nFinally, 7 women and 0 men:\n\nC(9, 7) = C(9, 2) = 9! / (2! * 7!) = (9*8*7!) / (2 * 7!) = (72) / 2 = 36\n\nC(12, 0) = 1\n\nSo, 36 * 1 = 36\n\nNow, I need to add up all these possibilities:\n\n20,790 (3W4M) + 27,720 (4W3M) + 8,316 (5W2M) + 504 (6W1M) + 36 (7W0M)\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n20,790 + 27,720 = 48,510\n\n48,510 + 8,316 = 56,826\n\n56,826 + 504 = 57,330\n\n57,330 + 36 = 57,366\n\nSo, the total number of different committees that can be formed with at least 3 women is 57,366.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with C(9, 3) = 84, actually, wait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, C(9, 3) is calculated as 9! / (3! * 6!) = (9*8*7) / (6) = 504 / 6 = 84\n\nWait, I think I miscalculated earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nC(9, 3) = 9*8*7 / (3*2*1) = 504 / 6 = 84\n\nSimilarly, C(12, 4) = 495, as I calculated before.\n\nSo, 84 * 495 = ?\n\n80 * 495 = 39,600\n\n4 * 495 = 1,980\n\nTotal: 41,580\n\nOkay, so the first calculation should be 41,580, not 20,790.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nC(9, 3) = 84\n\nC(12, 4) = 495\n\n84 * 495 = 41,580\n\nOkay, that's the number for 3 women and 4 men.\n\nNext, 4 women and 3 men:\n\nC(9, 4) = 126\n\nC(12, 3) = 220\n\n126 * 220 = 27,720\n\nOkay, that's correct.\n\nThen, 5 women and 2 men:\n\nC(9, 5) = 126\n\nC(12, 2) = 66\n\n126 * 66 = 8,316\n\nCorrect.\n\nNext, 6 women and 1 man:\n\nC(9, 6) = 84\n\nC(12, 1) = 12\n\n84 * 12 = 1,008\n\nWait, earlier I had 42, but it should be 84.\n\nAnd finally, 7 women and 0 men:\n\nC(9, 7) = 36\n\nC(12, 0) = 1\n\n36 * 1 = 36\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n41,580 + 27,720 = 69,300\n\n69,300 + 8,316 = 77,616\n\n77,616 + 1,008 = 78,624\n\n78,624 + 36 = 78,660\n\nSo, the total number of committees is 78,660.\n\nWait, but earlier I had a different total because of the miscalculation in C(9, 3).\n\nYes, that makes more sense.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that there's another way to approach this problem, which might be faster.\n\nWe can calculate the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that have fewer than 3 women, i.e., committees with 0, 1, or 2 women.\n\nSo, total number of committees without restrictions is C(21, 7), since there are 12 men + 9 women = 21 people.\n\nC(21, 7) = 21! / (7! * 14!) = (21*20*19*18*17*16*15*14!) / (5040 * 14!)) = (21*20*19*18*17*16*15) / 5040\n\nCalculating numerator: 21*20 = 420, *19=7,980, *18=143,640, *17=2,441,880, *16=39,070,080, *15=586,051,200\n\nDenominator: 5040\n\nSo, 586,051,200 / 5040 = let's see, 5040 * 116,280 = 586,051,200\n\nSo, C(21, 7) = 116,280\n\nNow, number of committees with fewer than 3 women is:\n\n- Committees with 0 women and 7 men: C(9, 0) * C(12, 7)\n\n- Committees with 1 woman and 6 men: C(9, 1) * C(12, 6)\n\n- Committees with 2 women and 5 men: C(9, 2) * C(12, 5)\n\nLet's calculate each of these.\n\nFirst, C(9, 0) * C(12, 7):\n\nC(9, 0) = 1\n\nC(12, 7) = C(12, 5) = 792 (since C(n, k) = C(n, n - k))\n\nSo, 1 * 792 = 792\n\nNext, C(9, 1) * C(12, 6):\n\nC(9, 1) = 9\n\nC(12, 6) = 924\n\nSo, 9 * 924 = 8,316\n\nThen, C(9, 2) * C(12, 5):\n\nC(9, 2) = 36\n\nC(12, 5) = 792\n\nSo, 36 * 792 = let's calculate that. 30 * 792 = 23,760, and 6 * 792 = 4,752, total 28,512\n\nTherefore, total number of committees with fewer than 3 women is 792 + 8,316 + 28,512 = let's add them up.\n\n792 + 8,316 = 9,108\n\n9,108 + 28,512 = 37,620\n\nSo, total committees with fewer than 3 women is 37,620\n\nNow, total committees without restrictions is 116,280\n\nTherefore, committees with at least 3 women is 116,280 - 37,620 = 78,660\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier corrected total I calculated by summing up each case separately.\n\nSo, the final answer is 78,660 different committees can be formed with at least 3 women.\n\nPhew, that was a bit involved, but I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78660} \\]"
