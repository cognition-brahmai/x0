        "content": "Let's see. I have this election problem here. Candidate A got 55% of the total votes, candidate B got 35%, and candidate C got 10%. Also, it's said that candidate A won by a margin of 5000 votes over candidate B. I need to find out how many total votes were cast in the election.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. I need to find the total number of votes, which I'll call T for total votes.\n\nNow, candidate A has 55% of T, which is 0.55T, and candidate B has 35% of T, which is 0.35T. The difference between A's votes and B's votes is given as 5000 votes.\n\nSo, the difference between A and B's votes is:\n\n0.55T - 0.35T = 0.20T\n\nAnd this difference is equal to 5000 votes.\n\nSo, 0.20T = 5000\n\nNow, to find T, I can divide both sides by 0.20:\n\nT = 5000 / 0.20\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n5000 divided by 0.20 is the same as 5000 divided by 1/5, which is 5000 * 5/1 = 25,000.\n\nSo, the total votes cast in the election were 25,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that.\n\nIf T is 25,000, then A's votes are 55% of 25,000, which is 0.55 * 25,000 = 13,750.\n\nB's votes are 35% of 25,000, which is 0.35 * 25,000 = 8,750.\n\nThe difference between A and B is 13,750 - 8,750 = 5,000 votes, which matches the given margin.\n\nAlso, candidate C has 10% of 25,000, which is 2,500 votes.\n\nAdding them up: 13,750 + 8,750 + 2,500 = 25,000, which checks out.\n\nSo, the total votes cast were 25,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25000} \\]"
