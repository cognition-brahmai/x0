        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to build a Node.js server that handles WebSocket connections, broadcasts messages to all connected clients, and keeps track of clients with their usernames. I'm excited to dive into this, but I'm a bit new to WebSockets, so I'll need to do some research and make sure I understand everything step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a basic Node.js server. I know that Node.js is great for real-time applications because of its event-driven architecture, which is perfect for WebSockets. WebSockets allow for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, which means data can be sent and received simultaneously, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps.\n\nSo, to start, I need to choose a WebSocket library for Node.js. The most popular one seems to be `ws`, which is a simple WebSocket client and server implementation. I think I'll go with that.\n\nNext, I need to set up a basic server that can accept WebSocket connections. I recall that to create a WebSocket server, I need to import the `WebSocket` class from the `ws` library and create a new server instance, passing in the server object, which is usually an HTTP server.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to create an HTTP server first and then create a WebSocket server that listens on the same port. Let me look that up.\n\nYes, according to the `ws` library documentation, I need to create an HTTP server and then create a WebSocket server, passing in the HTTP server instance.\n\nSo, in code, it would look something like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\n\nconst server = http.createServer();\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });\n\nserver.listen(8080, () => {\n  console.log('Server is listening on port 8080');\n});\n```\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. Now, I need to handle connections. When a client connects, I need to add them to a list of connected clients along with their username. But how do I get the username from the client?\n\nMaybe the client can send a message right after connecting that includes their username. Or perhaps I can pass the username as a query parameter in the WebSocket URL. Hmm, both options seem possible. Passing it in the query parameter might be cleaner.\n\nSo, if a client connects with a URL like `ws://myserver.com/socket?username=John`, I can extract the username from the URL.\n\nIn the `ws` library, the `connection` event is emitted when a client connects. So, I can listen for that event and extract the username from the request URL.\n\nLet me try writing that:\n\n```javascript\nwss.on('connection', (ws, request) => {\n  const url = new URL(request.url, `ws://${request.headers.host}`);\n  const username = url.searchParams.get('username');\n  if (!username) {\n    ws.close();\n    return;\n  }\n  // Add the client to the list with their username\n});\n```\n\nAlright, so now I need to maintain a list of connected clients with their usernames. I can use an array of objects, each containing the WebSocket instance and the username.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```javascript\nconst connectedClients = [];\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws, request) => {\n  const url = new URL(request.url, `ws://${request.headers.host}`);\n  const username = url.searchParams.get('username');\n  if (!username) {\n    ws.close();\n    return;\n  }\n  connectedClients.push({ ws, username });\n  console.log(`${username} connected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n});\n```\n\nAnd when a client disconnects, I need to remove them from the list.\n\nI can listen for the `close` event on the WebSocket:\n\n```javascript\nws.on('close', () => {\n  connectedClients = connectedClients.filter(client => client.ws !== ws);\n  console.log(`${username} disconnected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n});\n```\n\nWait, but I need to know the username when they disconnect. So, I should probably store the username with the WebSocket instance.\n\nMaybe I can store the connected clients in a Map where the key is the WebSocket instance and the value is the username.\n\nLike this:\n\n```javascript\nconst connectedClients = new Map();\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws, request) => {\n  const url = new URL(request.url, `ws://${request.headers.host}`);\n  const username = url.searchParams.get('username');\n  if (!username) {\n    ws.close();\n    return;\n  }\n  connectedClients.set(ws, username);\n  console.log(`${username} connected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.size}`);\n});\n\nws.on('close', () => {\n  const username = connectedClients.get(ws);\n  connectedClients.delete(ws);\n  console.log(`${username} disconnected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.size}`);\n});\n```\n\nThat seems better.\n\nNow, for broadcasting messages. When a client sends a message, I need to broadcast that message to all connected clients.\n\nFirst, I need to listen for the `message` event on the WebSocket.\n\nThen, I can iterate over the connected clients and send the message to each one.\n\nBut I need to make sure not to send the message back to the sender.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n```javascript\nws.on('message', (message) => {\n  for (const client of connectedClients) {\n    if (client.ws !== ws) {\n      client.ws.send(message);\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nWait, but in this setup, `connectedClients` is a Map where the keys are WebSocket instances and the values are usernames. So, I need to iterate over the Map's values.\n\nI think it's better to store connected clients in an array of objects, each containing the WebSocket and the username.\n\nLike this:\n\n```javascript\nconst connectedClients = [];\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws, request) => {\n  const url = new URL(request.url, `ws://${request.headers.host}`);\n  const username = url.searchParams.get('username');\n  if (!username) {\n    ws.close();\n    return;\n  }\n  connectedClients.push({ ws, username });\n  console.log(`${username} connected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n});\n\nws.on('close', () => {\n  connectedClients = connectedClients.filter(client => client.ws !== ws);\n  console.log(`${username} disconnected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n});\n\nws.on('message', (message) => {\n  for (const client of connectedClients) {\n    if (client.ws !== ws) {\n      client.ws.send(message);\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHmm, but in the `close` event, `username` is not defined. I need to retrieve it from the `connectedClients` array.\n\nLet me adjust that.\n\nMaybe store connected clients in an array of objects with `ws` and `username` properties.\n\nThen, in the `close` event, I can find the client by matching the WebSocket instance.\n\nLike this:\n\n```javascript\nws.on('close', () => {\n  const index = connectedClients.findIndex(client => client.ws === ws);\n  if (index !== -1) {\n    const { username } = connectedClients[index];\n    connectedClients.splice(index, 1);\n    console.log(`${username} disconnected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThat should work.\n\nAlso, I should handle any errors that might occur during the connection.\n\nMaybe add an error event listener on the WebSocket.\n\nLike this:\n\n```javascript\nws.on('error', (error) => {\n  console.error(`WebSocket error:`, error);\n});\n```\n\nAlright, now, to test this, I need to have a client that can connect to this WebSocket server and send messages.\n\nI can use a browser for that, as browsers support WebSockets natively.\n\nSo, in the browser, I can do something like:\n\n```javascript\nconst socket = new WebSocket('ws://myserver.com/socket?username=John');\n\nsocket.onopen = () => {\n  console.log('Connected to server');\n  socket.send('Hello, world!');\n};\n\nsocket.onmessage = (event) => {\n  console.log('Received message:', event.data);\n};\n\nsocket.onerror = (error) => {\n  console.error('WebSocket error:', error);\n};\n\nsocket.onclose = () => {\n  console.log('Disconnected from server');\n};\n```\n\nAssuming the server is running locally, I can replace `myserver.com` with `localhost` and set the port accordingly.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the server is accessible from the browser, so I might need to handle CORS if the browser is making requests from a different origin.\n\nBut since WebSockets use the `ws://` protocol, and assuming the server and the browser are on the same machine, CORS shouldn't be an issue.\n\nWait, actually, WebSockets have their own way of handling origins. I think the `ws` library in Node.js allows configuring origins.\n\nI can set the `perMessageDeflate` and `clientTracking` options, but for origins, I can use the `verifyClient` callback.\n\nBut perhaps for now, I can keep it simple and not worry about origins unless I run into issues.\n\nAlright, moving forward, I need to think about how to handle multiple clients connecting and sending messages simultaneously.\n\nI think the way I have it set up now, with broadcasting to all clients except the sender, should work fine.\n\nBut I should consider performance if there are many clients connected.\n\nEach time a message is received, I have to iterate over all connected clients and send the message to each one.\n\nIs there a better way to handle this?\n\nI've heard of broadcasting methods in some WebSocket libraries, but in the `ws` library, it seems like I have to handle it manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can maintain an array of WebSocket instances and use a loop to send messages to each one.\n\nSince JavaScript is single-threaded, and Node.js handles events asynchronously, I think it should handle multiple clients without issues, as long as the number of clients isn't too large.\n\nBut for the scope of this task, I think this approach is sufficient.\n\nAnother thing to consider is message buffering or queueing, to handle situations where messages are received faster than they can be processed and sent to clients.\n\nBut again, for now, I'll assume that the message load won't be too heavy.\n\nIf needed, I can look into optimizing that later.\n\nAlso, I should think about how to handle disconnections and reconnections.\n\nIn the current setup, when a client disconnects, it's removed from the connected clients list.\n\nIf a client reconnects, it will be added again with the same username.\n\nBut perhaps I need to handle unique usernames or handle cases where multiple clients try to connect with the same username.\n\nFor now, I'll allow multiple clients to have the same username, but ideally, usernames should be unique.\n\nTo enforce unique usernames, I can check if a username is already in use before adding a new client.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```javascript\nwss.on('connection', (ws, request) => {\n  const url = new URL(request.url, `ws://${request.headers.host}`);\n  const username = url.searchParams.get('username');\n  if (!username) {\n    ws.close();\n    return;\n  }\n  if (connectedClients.some(client => client.username === username)) {\n    ws.close();\n    console.log(`Username ${username} is already in use.`);\n    return;\n  }\n  connectedClients.push({ ws, username });\n  console.log(`${username} connected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis way, if a username is already taken, the new connection is closed.\n\nBut then, if a client disconnects and another client connects with the same username, they will be treated as a new user.\n\nDepending on the use case, this might be acceptable or not.\n\nIn a more robust system, I might want to handle user sessions or implement a way to reserve usernames for a certain period after disconnection.\n\nBut for this simple server, I think allowing multiple clients with the same username is okay, as long as I broadcast messages to all clients except the sender.\n\nWait, but if multiple clients have the same username, and one of them sends a message, it will be broadcasted to all others except the sender.\n\nSo, clients with the same username will see messages from other clients with the same username, except for their own messages.\n\nIs that desirable? Maybe not.\n\nPerhaps I should treat each connection as a unique client, regardless of the username.\n\nAlternatively, I could modify the broadcasting logic to only send messages to clients with different usernames.\n\nBut that might not make sense in all scenarios.\n\nMaybe it's better to allow multiple clients with the same username and broadcast messages to all clients except the sender, based on the WebSocket instance.\n\nI think that's the way to go.\n\nAnother consideration is message formatting.\n\nRight now, I'm sending plain text messages.\n\nBut in a real-world application, I might want to send structured data, like JSON objects, to include more information, such as the sender's username.\n\nFor example, when a client sends a message, I can wrap it in an object that includes the username and the message content.\n\nThen, when broadcasting, I can send that object to all clients.\n\nThis way, clients can display messages with the sender's username.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```javascript\nws.on('message', (message) => {\n  const broadcastMessage = { username: connectedClients.find(client => client.ws === ws).username, message: message };\n  for (const client of connectedClients) {\n    if (client.ws !== ws) {\n      client.ws.send(JSON.stringify(broadcastMessage));\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAnd on the client side, parse the JSON and display the message with the username.\n\nThis seems like a better approach.\n\nAlso, I should consider error handling when sending messages.\n\nIf a client is disconnected while trying to send a message, it might throw an error.\n\nSo, I should wrap the `send` method in a try-catch block.\n\nLike this:\n\n```javascript\nfor (const client of connectedClients) {\n  if (client.ws !== ws) {\n    try {\n      client.ws.send(JSON.stringify(broadcastMessage));\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(`Error sending message to ${client.username}:`, error);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, if there's an error sending a message to a particular client, it doesn't affect the broadcasting to other clients.\n\nFurthermore, I should think about how to handle large numbers of clients.\n\nNode.js has event loops and handles I/O operations efficiently, but with a large number of clients, memory usage and performance could become issues.\n\nI can monitor the server's resource usage and consider optimizations if needed.\n\nAlso, I might want to implement heartbeats or keep-alive mechanisms to detect disconnected clients promptly.\n\nThe `ws` library has built-in support for ping and pong frames, which can be used for keep-alives.\n\nI can enable per-message deflate to compress messages, which can be helpful if messages are large or sent frequently.\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it simple and see how it performs.\n\nAnother feature to consider is room-based messaging, where clients can join different rooms and receive messages only from clients in the same room.\n\nBut for this task, since I need to broadcast messages to all connected clients, I'll skip that for now.\n\nWait, but the task specifically says to broadcast messages to all connected clients, so room-based messaging isn't required.\n\nAlright, moving on.\n\nI should also think about how to close the server gracefully, maybe by listening for SIGINT or SIGTERM signals and closing all WebSocket connections before exiting.\n\nHere's how I can do that:\n\n```javascript\nprocess.on('SIGINT', () => {\n  console.log('Server is shutting down...');\n  wss.clients.forEach(client => {\n    client.close();\n  });\n  server.close(() => {\n    console.log('Server closed.');\n    process.exit(0);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis way, when the server receives an interrupt signal, it closes all WebSocket connections and then shuts down the HTTP server.\n\nSimilarly, I can handle the `SIGTERM` signal for clean shutdowns.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the basic requirements for this task.\n\nTo summarize, here's the plan:\n\n1. Set up an HTTP server and a WebSocket server using the `ws` library.\n\n2. Accept incoming WebSocket connections and extract the username from the query parameters.\n\n3. Maintain a list of connected clients with their usernames.\n\n4. Broadcast incoming messages from clients to all other connected clients, excluding the sender.\n\n5. Handle disconnections and remove clients from the connected clients list.\n\n6. Implement basic error handling and consider performance optimizations if needed.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in code.\n\nI'll start by installing the `ws` library.\n\nI can do that using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install ws\n```\n\nThen, I'll create a new JavaScript file, say `server.js`, and write the server code in there.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\n- Import required modules: `http` and `WebSocket` from `ws`.\n\n- Create an HTTP server.\n\n- Create a WebSocket server attached to the HTTP server.\n\n- Define an array or a Map to store connected clients.\n\n- Handle incoming connections:\n\n- Extract username from query parameters.\n\n- Add the client to the connected clients list.\n\n- Handle messages from clients:\n\n- Broadcast the message to all other connected clients.\n\n- Handle client disconnections:\n\n- Remove the client from the connected clients list.\n\n- Add error handling for WebSocket errors.\n\n- Implement graceful shutdown on SIGINT or SIGTERM.\n\nLet me start writing the code based on this outline.\n\nFirst, importing modules:\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\n```\n\nThen, creating the HTTP and WebSocket servers:\n\n```javascript\nconst server = http.createServer();\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });\n```\n\nSetting up the connected clients list:\n\n```javascript\nconst connectedClients = [];\n```\n\nHandling connections:\n\n```javascript\nwss.on('connection', (ws, request) => {\n  const url = new URL(request.url, `ws://${request.headers.host}`);\n  const username = url.searchParams.get('username');\n  if (!username) {\n    ws.close();\n    return;\n  }\n  connectedClients.push({ ws, username });\n  console.log(`${username} connected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n  \n  ws.on('message', (message) => {\n    const broadcastMessage = { username, message: message };\n    for (const client of connectedClients) {\n      if (client.ws !== ws) {\n        try {\n          client.ws.send(JSON.stringify(broadcastMessage));\n        } catch (error) {\n          console.error(`Error sending message to ${client.username}:`, error);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n  \n  ws.on('close', () => {\n    connectedClients = connectedClients.filter(client => client.ws !== ws);\n    console.log(`${username} disconnected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n  });\n  \n  ws.on('error', (error) => {\n    console.error(`WebSocket error:`, error);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nImplementing graceful shutdown:\n\n```javascript\nprocess.on('SIGINT', () => {\n  console.log('Server is shutting down...');\n  wss.clients.forEach(client => {\n    client.close();\n  });\n  server.close(() => {\n    console.log('Server closed.');\n    process.exit(0);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFinally, starting the server:\n\n```javascript\nserver.listen(8080, () => {\n  console.log('Server is listening on port 8080');\n});\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the complete `server.js` would look like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\n\nconst server = http.createServer();\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });\n\nconst connectedClients = [];\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws, request) => {\n  const url = new URL(request.url, `ws://${request.headers.host}`);\n  const username = url.searchParams.get('username');\n  if (!username) {\n    ws.close();\n    return;\n  }\n  connectedClients.push({ ws, username });\n  console.log(`${username} connected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n  \n  ws.on('message', (message) => {\n    const broadcastMessage = { username, message: message };\n    for (const client of connectedClients) {\n      if (client.ws !== ws) {\n        try {\n          client.ws.send(JSON.stringify(broadcastMessage));\n        } catch (error) {\n          console.error(`Error sending message to ${client.username}:`, error);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n  \n  ws.on('close', () => {\n    connectedClients = connectedClients.filter(client => client.ws !== ws);\n    console.log(`${username} disconnected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n  });\n  \n  ws.on('error', (error) => {\n    console.error(`WebSocket error:`, error);\n  });\n});\n\nprocess.on('SIGINT', () => {\n  console.log('Server is shutting down...');\n  wss.clients.forEach(client => {\n    client.close();\n  });\n  server.close(() => {\n    console.log('Server closed.');\n    process.exit(0);\n  });\n});\n\nserver.listen(8080, () => {\n  console.log('Server is listening on port 8080');\n});\n```\n\nNow, I need to test this server.\n\nI can run the server using Node.js:\n\n```\nnode server.js\n```\n\nThen, in a browser, open the WebSocket connection:\n\n```javascript\nconst socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/socket?username=John');\n\nsocket.onopen = () => {\n  console.log('Connected to server');\n  socket.send('Hello, world!');\n};\n\nsocket.onmessage = (event) => {\n  console.log('Received message:', event.data);\n};\n\nsocket.onerror = (error) => {\n  console.error('WebSocket error:', error);\n};\n\nsocket.onclose = () => {\n  console.log('Disconnected from server');\n};\n```\n\nI can open multiple browser tabs or use different browsers to simulate multiple clients connecting with different usernames.\n\nFor example, in one tab:\n\n```\nws://localhost:8080/socket?username=John\n```\n\nIn another tab:\n\n```\nws://localhost:8080/socket?username=Jane\n```\n\nWhen John sends a message, Jane should receive it, and vice versa.\n\nAlso, if John sends a message, he shouldn't receive his own message back, as we're excluding the sender in the broadcast loop.\n\nI should also test scenarios where clients disconnect and reconnect, and see if the server handles them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, I can use tools like `websocat` or `WebSocket-Node` library to create multiple client connections for testing.\n\nFor example, using `websocat` in the terminal:\n\n```\nwebsocat ws://localhost:8080/socket?username=Bob\n```\n\nThen, I can type messages and see them being broadcasted to other connected clients.\n\nI should also check the server console to see logs of connections, disconnections, and message broadcasts.\n\nIf everything works as expected, then the server is functioning correctly.\n\nPotential improvements or features to add in the future could include:\n\n- Unique usernames: Ensure that only one client can use a particular username at a time.\n\n- Message history: Store and send recent messages to new clients when they connect.\n\n- Room-based messaging: Allow clients to join rooms and receive messages only from clients in the same room.\n\n- Heartbeat mechanisms: Implement periodic pings to check the liveness of connections.\n\n- Error reporting: Improve error handling and logging.\n\n- Security: Validate and sanitize usernames and messages to prevent injection attacks.\n\nBut for this task, the basic broadcasting server should suffice.\n\nI think I've covered all the requirements and added some additional features like broadcasting structured messages with usernames.\n\nIf there are any issues or edge cases I missed, I can always iterate and improve the server further.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a Node.js server that accepts incoming WebSocket connections and broadcasts messages received from clients to all connected clients, while maintaining a list of connected clients and their associated usernames, follow these steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\n\nconst server = http.createServer();\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });\n\nconst connectedClients = [];\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws, request) => {\n  const url = new URL(request.url, `ws://${request.headers.host}`);\n  const username = url.searchParams.get('username');\n  if (!username) {\n    ws.close();\n    return;\n  }\n  connectedClients.push({ ws, username });\n  console.log(`${username} connected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n  \n  ws.on('message', (message) => {\n    const broadcastMessage = { username, message: message };\n    for (const client of connectedClients) {\n      if (client.ws !== ws) {\n        try {\n          client.ws.send(JSON.stringify(broadcastMessage));\n        } catch (error) {\n          console.error(`Error sending message to ${client.username}:`, error);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n  \n  ws.on('close', () => {\n    connectedClients = connectedClients.filter(client => client.ws !== ws);\n    console.log(`${username} disconnected. Total clients: ${connectedClients.length}`);\n  });\n  \n  ws.on('error', (error) => {\n    console.error(`WebSocket error:`, error);\n  });\n});\n\nprocess.on('SIGINT', () => {\n  console.log('Server is shutting down...');\n  wss.clients.forEach(client => {\n    client.close();\n  });\n  server.close(() => {\n    console.log('Server closed.');\n    process.exit(0);\n  });\n});\n\nserver.listen(8080, () => {\n  console.log('Server is listening on port 8080');\n});\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Server Setup**:\n   - Use `http` to create an HTTP server.\n   - Attach a WebSocket server to it using the `ws` library.\n\n2. **Handling Connections**:\n   - Extract the `username` from the query parameters of the WebSocket URL.\n   - Store connected clients in an array with their usernames.\n\n3. **Broadcasting Messages**:\n   - When a message is received from a client, broadcast it to all other connected clients excluding the sender.\n   - Messages are sent as JSON objects containing the username and message content.\n\n4. **Handling Disconnections**:\n   - Remove disconnected clients from the list of connected clients.\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - Log WebSocket errors for debugging purposes.\n\n6. **Graceful Shutdown**:\n   - Close all WebSocket connections and shut down the server gracefully on receiving SIGINT or SIGTERM signals.\n\nThis setup ensures that the server can handle multiple WebSocket connections, maintain a list of connected users, and efficiently broadcast messages among them."
