Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the outcome of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a mix of both.\n\nAvailable tools to be used:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It helps in locating a suitable list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's query.\nWebScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline separated links, where input is one or more links, and generates plain text output containing the link contents.\nURLCollector[input]: Gathers links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline separated response of links.\nQAModel[input]: Question answering language model, especially useful in answering questions based on an input text passage. The input must be a text question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What is the dog's breed, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe input to each function should simply be a plain string, without quotation marks or \"+\" to join a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAModel[What is the tallest building in the world, given :evidence3:?]\n\nMake sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should follow this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the population of Tokyo and how has it changed over the past decade?"
