        "content": "In the depths where the ocean doth lie,  \nWhere the shadows and secrets reside,  \nA darkness so deep,  \nIn its icy cold sleep,  \nHides the heart of the world, side by side.  \n  \nUpon waves that are wild and forlorn,  \nThe moon's spectral light is outpoured,  \nOn the shore's dreary sand,  \nWhere the seagulls stand,  \nAnd the sorrowful winds forever are hoarse.  \n  \nBeneath the vast sky's somber hue,  \nThe ocean's vast heart beats slow,  \nWith a mournful refrain,  \nEchoing pain,  \nIn the whispers of the tides ebb and flow.  \n  \nOh, the ocean, a sable abyss,  \nWhere the shipwrecked souls find their rest,  \nIn the arms of the sea,  \nThey eternally be,  \nLost to the world, yet in memory blessed.  \n  \nSo let us toast to the ocean's might,  \nWith a glass of the darkest wine,  \nFor in its depths so old,  \nLie tales yet untold,  \nOf love, of loss, and of life's design."
