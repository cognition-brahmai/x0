Europe is full of hidden gems that are just waiting to be discovered, and I'll do my best to guide you towards some of these amazing places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the time of year you're planning to travel. The best time to visit Europe is generally during the shoulder seasons of spring (April to June) and autumn (September to October), when the weather is pleasant and there are fewer tourists compared to the peak summer months. However, since you're open to any time, I'll plan assuming a spring or autumn trip.\n\nGiven that we have two weeks, I'll aim to cover a few countries to give you a taste of different cultures. Starting from the United Kingdom, moving through Scandinavia, visiting Eastern Europe, and ending in Italy. This itinerary will allow you to experience a diverse range of landscapes, histories, and traditions.\n\n**Day 1-3: United Kingdom - York and the Yorkshire Dales**\n\nBegin your journey in York, a city rich in history but often overshadowed by more popular cities like London or Edinburgh. York has beautifully preserved medieval walls, charming narrow streets, and the iconic York Minster cathedral. Spend a day exploring the city on foot, visiting attractions like the York Minster, Clifford's Tower, and the Jorvik Viking Centre.\n\nFrom York, take a day trip to the Yorkshire Dales, a limestone scenery area known for its rolling hills, picturesque villages, and peaceful valleys. You can go hiking, visit local markets, or simply enjoy the serene countryside.\n\n**Day 4-6: Norway - Bergen and Geiranger**\n\nFly to Bergen, a coastal city in western Norway known for its colorful wooden houses and vibrant music scene. Bergen is also a great base for exploring the fjords. Take a ferry to the UNESCO-listed Geirangerfjord, where you can hike among waterfalls and enjoy breathtaking views of the fjord.\n\n**Day 7-9: Poland - Krakow and Wieliczka Salt Mine**\n\nTravel to Krakow, a city in southern Poland known for its well-preserved medieval architecture and rich Jewish heritage. Visit the historic Old Town, Wawel Castle, and the Schindler's Factory museum. Don't miss the opportunity to explore the Wieliczka Salt Mine, a UNESCO World Heritage site featuring underground chapels carved from salt.\n\n**Day 10-12: Czech Republic - Prague and Cesky Krumlov**\n\nHead to Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, famous for its stunning medieval Old Town, Prague Castle, and the Charles Bridge. While Prague is a popular destination, it still offers plenty of unique experiences, such as exploring the Jewish Quarter or taking a boat ride along the Vltava River.\n\nFrom Prague, take a day trip to Cesky Krumlov, a small town in southern Bohemia known for its well-preserved medieval old town and the impressive Cesky Krumlov Castle. The town is a UNESCO World Heritage site and offers a glimpse into the region's rich history.\n\n**Day 13-14: Italy - Sorrento and Amalfi Coast**\n\nEnd your trip in Sorrento, a coastal town on the Sorrentine Peninsula, known for its panoramic views of the Bay of Naples and the island of Capri. Spend your days relaxing on the beach, exploring the town's narrow streets, and taking day trips along the Amalfi Coast, visiting picturesque towns like Positano and Amalfi.\n\nThis itinerary provides a mix of historical cities, natural beauty, and cultural experiences, all while avoiding the most tourist-heavy destinations. Each location offers something unique and will allow you to immerse yourself in the local culture.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n- **Transportation:** Consider purchasing a Eurail Pass for easy travel between countries. Internal flights are also an option for saving time.\n\n- **Accommodation:** Book accommodations in central locations to make the most of each city's offerings. Airbnb and boutique hotels can offer a more authentic experience.\n\n- **Local Experiences:** Try local cuisines, attend cultural events, and interact with locals to gain deeper insights into each destination.\n\n- **Pack Appropriately:** Since you're traveling across different climates, pack layers and appropriate footwear for hiking and city exploration.\n\nI hope this itinerary inspires and helps you plan an unforgettable two-week adventure through Europe's lesser-known treasures. If you have any specific interests or preferences, feel free to let me know, and I can tailor the itinerary further."
