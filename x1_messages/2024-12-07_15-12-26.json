        "content": "The Epsom Derby, often referred to simply as \"The Derby,\" holds a prestigious place in the annals of horse racing history. First run in 1780 at Epsom Racecourse in Surrey, England, it was established by the 12th Earl of Derby and his friends Sir Charles Bunbury and Edward Smith-Stanley. The race was named after the Earl and has since become one of the most renowned and competitive flat races in the world.\n\n**Significance in Horse Racing History:**\n\n1. **Historical Prestige:** The Epsom Derby is one of the oldest classic races still run today, and it has maintained its prestige over centuries.
