        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem. I've got 8 red balls and 12 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 20 balls. I need to find the probability that the third ball I pick is red, and I'm picking without replacement. That means once I pick a ball, it stays out of the bag.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The probability of the third ball being red. Since I'm not replacing the balls, each pick affects the remaining balls in the bag.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider all possible sequences of picking three balls and see in how many of those sequences the third ball is red.\n\nBut that might get complicated, especially since the picks are dependent on each other.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the positions of the balls. Since all balls are equally likely to be in any position when picked randomly, the probability that the third ball is red should be the same as the probability that any specific ball picked is red.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think.\n\nIn the first pick, the probability of getting a red ball is 8 out of 20, since there are 8 red balls and 20 total balls.\n\nFor the second pick, it depends on what was picked first. If the first was red, then there are 7 red and 19 total balls left. If the first was blue, then 8 red and 19 total left.\n\nAnd for the third pick, it depends on the first two picks.\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me consider the total number of ways to pick three balls from 20. That's combinations, since order doesn't matter, but in this case, order does matter because we're picking sequentially.\n\nWait, actually, in probability problems like this, often the order matters because we're considering sequences of events.\n\nSo, maybe it's better to think in terms of permutations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick three balls in order from 20 is 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18.\n\nNow, we need the number of sequences where the third ball is red.\n\nLet's think about it. The first two picks can be any combination of red and blue, as long as the third is red.\n\nSo, for the third pick to be red, we need to have at least one red ball left when we pick the third ball.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can think of it as the probability that, in a random arrangement of the balls, the third position is red.\n\nSince all balls are equally likely to be in any position, the probability that any specific position is red should be equal to the proportion of red balls in the total.\n\nIn other words, since there are 8 red balls out of 20, the probability that the third ball is red is simply 8/20, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nIs that correct? It seems too straightforward.\n\nLet me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose I have 2 red balls and 2 blue balls, and I want to find the probability that the second ball picked is red.\n\nIf I apply the same logic, it should be 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nBut let's list all possible sequences:\n\nPossible sequences when picking 2 balls without replacement:\n\n- Red, Red\n\n- Red, Blue\n\n- Blue, Red\n\n- Blue, Blue\n\nNow, in which of these is the second ball red?\n\n- In \"Red, Red\" and \"Blue, Red\"\n\nSo, out of 4 sequences, 2 have the second ball as red. Therefore, the probability is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nThat matches the earlier conclusion. So, perhaps the probability is indeed just the proportion of red balls.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that, since each ball is equally likely to be in any position, the probability that the third ball is red is the same as the probability that the first ball is red, which is 8/20.\n\nBut wait, intuitively, it seems like the probability could change based on what's picked earlier.\n\nFor example, if the first two picks are both blue, then there are still 8 red balls out of 18 remaining balls, so the probability that the third is red would be 8/18.\n\nIf the first pick is red and the second is blue, then there are 7 red balls and 11 blue balls left, so the probability the third is red is 7/18.\n\nIf the first is blue and the second is red, similar to above.\n\nIf the first two are both red, then 6 red left out of 18, so 6/18.\n\nSo, it seems like the probability varies based on previous picks.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it might just be 8/20.\n\nMaybe I need to calculate it properly.\n\nLet me try to calculate the total probability by considering all possible scenarios for the first two picks.\n\nFirst, the first pick can be either red or blue.\n\nIf the first pick is red (probability 8/20), then the second pick can be red or blue.\n\n- If second is red (probability 7/19), then third is red with probability 6/18\n\n- If second is blue (probability 12/19), then third is red with probability 7/18\n\nSimilarly, if the first pick is blue (probability 12/20), then:\n\n- If second is red (probability 8/19), then third is red with probability 7/18\n\n- If second is blue (probability 11/19), then third is red with probability 8/18\n\nThis is getting complicated, but maybe if I calculate it step by step.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nP(R3) = probability that third ball is red.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, considering the first two picks.\n\nP(R3) = P(R3 | RR) * P(RR) + P(R3 | RB) * P(RB) + P(R3 | BR) * P(BR) + P(R3 | BB) * P(BB)\n\nWhere:\n\n- RR: first two picks are red\n\n- RB: first is red, second is blue\n\n- BR: first is blue, second is red\n\n- BB: first two are blue\n\nNow, let's calculate each term.\n\nFirst, P(RR) = (8/20) * (7/19)\n\nP(R3 | RR) = 6/18\n\nSo, P(R3 | RR) * P(RR) = (6/18) * (8/20) * (7/19)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(RB) = (8/20) * (12/19)\n\nP(R3 | RB) = 7/18\n\nSo, P(R3 | RB) * P(RB) = (7/18) * (8/20) * (12/19)\n\nP(BR) = (12/20) * (8/19)\n\nP(R3 | BR) = 7/18\n\nSo, P(R3 | BR) * P(BR) = (7/18) * (12/20) * (8/19)\n\nP(BB) = (12/20) * (11/19)\n\nP(R3 | BB) = 8/18\n\nSo, P(R3 | BB) * P(BB) = (8/18) * (12/20) * (11/19)\n\nNow, sum all these up:\n\nP(R3) = [(6/18)*(8/20)*(7/19)] + [(7/18)*(8/20)*(12/19)] + [(7/18)*(12/20)*(8/19)] + [(8/18)*(12/20)*(11/19)]\n\nLet me calculate each term separately.\n\nFirst term: (6/18)*(8/20)*(7/19) = (1/3)*(2/5)*(7/19) = (2*7)/(3*5*19) = 14/(285)\n\nSecond term: (7/18)*(8/20)*(12/19) = (7/18)*(2/5)*(12/19) = (7*2*12)/(18*5*19) = (168)/(1710)\n\nThird term: (7/18)*(12/20)*(8/19) = (7/18)*(3/5)*(8/19) = (7*3*8)/(18*5*19) = (168)/(1710)\n\nFourth term: (8/18)*(12/20)*(11/19) = (4/9)*(3/5)*(11/19) = (4*3*11)/(9*5*19) = (132)/(855)\n\nWait, I need to make sure the denominators are the same to add these fractions easily.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst term: 14/285\n\nSecond term: 168/1710\n\nThird term: 168/1710\n\nFourth term: 132/855\n\nLet's find a common denominator. 285 * 6 = 1710, and 855 * 2 = 1710.\n\nSo, convert all fractions to have denominator 1710.\n\nFirst term: 14/285 = (14*6)/1710 = 84/1710\n\nSecond term: 168/1710\n\nThird term: 168/1710\n\nFourth term: 132/855 = (132*2)/1710 = 264/1710\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n84 + 168 + 168 + 264 = 684\n\nSo, P(R3) = 684 / 1710\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator divisible by 12.\n\n684 \u00f7 12 = 57\n\n1710 \u00f7 12 = 142.5, wait, that doesn't divide evenly. Maybe I messed up.\n\nWait, 684 and 1710, let's find the greatest common divisor.\n\n684 \u00f7 12 = 57\n\n1710 \u00f7 12 = 142.5, which is not an integer. So, 12 is not a common divisor.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to divide both by 6.\n\n684 \u00f7 6 = 114\n\n1710 \u00f7 6 = 285\n\nNow, 114 and 285, can these be simplified further?\n\n114 \u00f7 3 = 38\n\n285 \u00f7 3 = 95\n\nSo, 38/95\n\nCan this be simplified more? 38 and 95 are both divisible by 19.\n\n38 \u00f7 19 = 2\n\n95 \u00f7 19 = 5\n\nSo, P(R3) = 2/5\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, after all that, the probability simplifies to 2/5, which is the same as 8/20.\n\nSo, in the end, the probability that the third ball is red is 2/5.\n\nThis confirms my initial intuition that it's just the proportion of red balls in the total, which makes sense because each ball is equally likely to be in any position.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
