        "content": "Let's calculate the total revenue for the month based on the sales of the three products.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much revenue was generated from each product separately, and then sum them up to get the total revenue.\n\nStarting with Product A:\n\nThey sold 250 units at $50 each.\n\nSo, revenue from Product A = number of units sold \u00d7 price per unit = 250 \u00d7 50.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n250 \u00d7 50 = 12,500.\n\nSo, $12,500 from Product A.\n\nNext, Product B:\n\n150 units at $75 each.\n\nRevenue from Product B = 150 \u00d7 75.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n150 \u00d7 75.\n\nWell, 150 \u00d7 70 = 10,500, and 150 \u00d7 5 = 750. So, total is 10,500 + 750 = 11,250.\n\nSo, $11,250 from Product B.\n\nNow, Product C:\n\n100 units at $120 each.\n\nRevenue from Product C = 100 \u00d7 120 = 12,000.\n\nSo, $12,000 from Product C.\n\nNow, to find the total revenue, I need to add up the revenues from all three products:\n\nTotal revenue = revenue from A + revenue from B + revenue from C = 12,500 + 11,250 + 12,000.\n\nLet's add those up:\n\n12,500 + 11,250 = 23,750.\n\nThen, 23,750 + 12,000 = 35,750.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue for the month is $35,750.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35750} \\]"
