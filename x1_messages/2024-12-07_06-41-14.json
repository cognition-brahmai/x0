        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 10 red balls, 20 blue balls, and 30 green balls. So in total, there are 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 balls in the box. The question is, if I pick three balls blindly from the box, what's the probability that I pick one ball of each color?\n\nOkay, probability questions can sometimes trip me up, but let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is the likelihood of a specific event happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to pick any three balls from the box. And the favorable outcomes are the ways to pick one red, one blue, and one green ball.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the total number of ways to pick three balls from 60. That sounds like a combination problem because the order in which I pick the balls doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose three balls from 60 is:\n\n\\[\nC(60, 3) = \\frac{60!}{3!(60 - 3)!} = \\frac{60!}{3! \\cdot 57!}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculating factorials of large numbers like 60! can be cumbersome, but we can simplify this. Since 60! is 60 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 58 \u00d7 57!, the 57! in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving us with:\n\n\\[\nC(60, 3) = \\frac{60 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 58}{3!} = \\frac{60 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 58}{6} = \\frac{205,320}{6} = 34,220\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 34,220 different ways to choose any three balls from the box.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is picking one red, one blue, and one green ball.\n\nLet's think about this. There are 10 red balls, 20 blue balls, and 30 green balls. Since I need one of each color, I can calculate the number of ways to pick one red ball, one blue ball, and one green ball, and then multiply them together.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one red ball from 10 is:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 1) = \\frac{10!}{1!(10 - 1)!} = \\frac{10!}{1! \\cdot 9!} = \\frac{10 \u00d7 9!}{1 \u00d7 9!} = 10\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick one blue ball from 20 is:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 1) = \\frac{20!}{1!(20 - 1)!} = \\frac{20!}{1! \\cdot 19!} = \\frac{20 \u00d7 19!}{1 \u00d7 19!} = 20\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to pick one green ball from 30 is:\n\n\\[\nC(30, 1) = \\frac{30!}{1!(30 - 1)!} = \\frac{30!}{1! \\cdot 29!} = \\frac{30 \u00d7 29!}{1 \u00d7 29!} = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, since these are independent choices (picking one red, one blue, and one green), the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these individual choices:\n\n\\[\n10 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 30 = 6,000\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 6,000 ways to pick one ball of each color.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one of each color}) = \\frac{6,000}{34,220}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6,000 \u00f7 20}{34,220 \u00f7 20} = \\frac{300}{1,711}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{300}{1,711} \\).\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should check if this fraction can be simplified further. Let's see if 300 and 1,711 have any common factors.\n\nThe prime factors of 300 are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5.\n\nThe prime factors of 1,711... hmm, 1,711 divided by 29 is 59 (because 29 \u00d7 59 = 1,711).\n\nSo, the prime factors are 29 and 59.\n\nSince there are no common factors between 300 and 1,711, the fraction \\( \\frac{300}{1,711} \\) is already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a sense of the probability.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{1,711} \\approx 0.1753\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 17.53%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Is there roughly an 17.53% chance of picking one ball of each color?\n\nLet me think about it differently to verify.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the probability of picking a red, then a blue, then a green ball, in that specific order, and then account for all possible orders.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red ball first is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that a red ball has been picked, there are 59 balls left, including 20 blue and 30 green.\n\nThe probability of picking a blue ball next is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{59}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that a red and a blue ball have been picked, there are 58 balls left, including 30 green.\n\nThe probability of picking a green ball next is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{58} = \\frac{15}{29}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red, then a blue, then a green ball is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} \u00d7 \\frac{20}{59} \u00d7 \\frac{15}{29} = \\frac{1 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 15}{6 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 29} = \\frac{3,000}{10,542} = \\frac{500}{1,711}\n\\]\n\nWait, earlier I got \\( \\frac{300}{1,711} \\), but now I have \\( \\frac{500}{1,711} \\). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nI think I see what's wrong. In this approach, I considered only one specific order: red, then blue, then green. But there are actually six possible orders to pick one of each color:\n\n1. Red, Blue, Green\n\n2. Red, Green, Blue\n\n3. Blue, Red, Green\n\n4. Blue, Green, Red\n\n5. Green, Red, Blue\n\n6. Green, Blue, Red\n\nEach of these orders has the same probability, which is \\( \\frac{500}{1,711} \\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if I multiply \\( \\frac{500}{1,711} \\) by 6, I get \\( \\frac{3,000}{1,711} \\), which is more than 1, which is impossible for a probability.\n\nHmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me recalculate the probability for one specific order.\n\nStarting again:\n\nProbability of picking a red ball first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that a red ball has been picked, the probability of picking a blue ball next:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{59}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that a red and a blue ball have been picked, the probability of picking a green ball next:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{58} = \\frac{15}{29}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability for the sequence red, blue, green is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} \u00d7 \\frac{20}{59} \u00d7 \\frac{15}{29} = \\frac{1 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 15}{6 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 29} = \\frac{300}{10,542} = \\frac{50}{1,711}\n\\]\n\nWait, earlier I mistakenly calculated \\( 1 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 15 = 3,000 \\), but actually, it's 300.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{300}{10,542} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{50}{1,711} \\).\n\nNow, since there are 6 possible orders, the total probability is:\n\n\\[\n6 \u00d7 \\frac{50}{1,711} = \\frac{300}{1,711}\n\\]\n\nSo, this matches my earlier calculation of \\( \\frac{300}{1,711} \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking one ball of each color is \\( \\frac{300}{1,711} \\), or approximately 17.53%.\n\nI think that makes sense now. I had a moment of confusion when I thought the probabilities were adding up to more than 1, but that was just a calculation error.\n\nIt's always a good idea to cross-verify using different methods to ensure consistency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{300}{1711}} \\]"
