        "content": "Let's see. There are 8 people standing in a circle, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total.\n\nFirst, I know that in a group of people, the number of possible handshakes can be found using combinations. Specifically, it's the number of ways to choose 2 people out of the total number to shake hands, since a handshake involves two people.\n\nSo, for 8 people, the number of handshakes would be the combination of 8 people taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate the factorials.\n\nFirst, \\( 8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40320 \\).\n\nThen, \\( 6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720 \\).\n\nAnd \\( 2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\).\n\nNow, plugging these back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{40320}{2 \\times 720} = \\frac{40320}{1440} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 28 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to think about this without calculating all the factorials? Because factorials can get really big and tedious to calculate for larger numbers.\n\nLet me think. Maybe there's a pattern or a simpler formula I can use.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each person shaking hands with every other person except themselves and the people they've already shaken hands with.\n\nSo, person 1 shakes hands with persons 2 through 8, that's 7 handshakes.\n\nPerson 2 has already shaken hands with person 1, so they shake hands with persons 3 through 8, that's 6 handshakes.\n\nPerson 3 has already shaken hands with persons 1 and 2, so they shake hands with persons 4 through 8, that's 5 handshakes.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nPerson 4: shakes with persons 5 through 8, 4 handshakes.\n\nPerson 5: shakes with persons 6 through 8, 3 handshakes.\n\nPerson 6: shakes with persons 7 and 8, 2 handshakes.\n\nPerson 7: shakes with person 8, 1 handshake.\n\nPerson 8: has already shaken hands with everyone.\n\nSo, total handshakes would be 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28.\n\nThat matches the combination formula result.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). In this case, n = 7, since person 1 shakes hands with 7 others.\n\nSo, sum = \\( \\frac{7 \\times 8}{2} = 28 \\), which again confirms the earlier result.\n\nWait, but in the combination formula, it was \\( C(8, 2) = 28 \\), and here, summing the series up to 7, also gives 28.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut let's think about the circle aspect. The problem mentions that people are standing in a circle, but does the shape they're standing in affect the number of handshakes?\n\nIn this case, since everyone shakes hands with everyone else regardless of their position, the circle doesn't impose any restrictions or additions to the handshakes. It's just a way of visualizing their positions, but the handshakes are between any two people, so the circle doesn't affect the total count.\n\nHowever, if there were restrictions based on the circle, like only shaking hands with neighbors, that would be different. But the problem says each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, so the circle doesn't come into play beyond just the initial arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is indeed 28.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose we have 8 people, and each shakes hands with 7 others.\n\nSo, total handshakes would be 8 \u00d7 7 = 56.\n\nBut in this count, each handshake is counted twice, once for each participant. So, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, we need to divide by 2.\n\nThus, total handshakes = \\( \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28 \\).\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis method is similar to using the combination formula, since \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\), and for \\( C(8, 2) \\), it's \\( \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28 \\).\n\nSo, all these different methods confirm that the total number of handshakes is 28.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 28 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
