        "content": "The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nGiven that the volume is 288 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:\n\n288 = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b3\n\nTo solve for r, we can first multiply both sides by 3/4 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n(3/4) * 288 = \u03c0 * r\u00b3\n\n216 = \u03c0 * r\u00b3\n\nNow, divide both sides by \u03c0:\n\n216 / \u03c0 = r\u00b3\n\nCalculate 216 divided by \u03c0:\n\n216 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 68.75493541\n\nSo, r\u00b3 \u2248 68.75493541\n\nNow, take the cube root of both sides to solve for r:\n\nr \u2248 \u221b68.75493541\n\nUsing a calculator to find the cube root:\n\nr \u2248 4.100000000 inches\n\nTherefore, the radius of the sphere is approximately 4.1 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.1} \\]"
