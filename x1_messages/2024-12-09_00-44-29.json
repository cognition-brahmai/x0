        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem about expanding an airport's runway capacity. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the airport currently has two parallel runways, each 12,000 feet long and 200 feet wide. They're planning to add a third runway of the same dimensions and also upgrade all the existing runways to handle heavier aircraft. I need to calculate the total area of asphalt required for this project.\n\nOkay, so let's start by understanding what's being asked. The total area of asphalt required would include the area for the new runway and the area for upgrading the existing two runways. So, it's essentially the area of three runways.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"upgrading all runways to handle heavier aircraft.\" Does that mean that the existing runways are being replaced with new asphalt, or is it just a matter of strengthening the existing surfaces without replacing them entirely? The problem doesn't specify, but for the purpose of calculating the asphalt area, I'll assume that upgrading involves laying new asphalt on the existing runways. So, that means all three runways will have new asphalt.\n\nSo, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all three runways.\n\nLet's recall that the area of a rectangle is length times width. Each runway is 12,000 feet long and 200 feet wide, so the area for one runway is:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\nArea = 12,000 feet \u00d7 200 feet\nArea = 2,400,000 square feet\n\nSince there are three such runways, the total area would be:\n\nTotal area = 3 \u00d7 2,400,000 square feet\nTotal area = 7,200,000 square feet\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions that the new runway will be built 1,000 feet away from the existing ones. Does that affect the area calculation? Well, the distance between the runways doesn't directly affect the area of the runways themselves, so I don't think that changes anything. It might be relevant for other aspects of airport design, like safety distances or land requirements, but for the asphalt area, it shouldn't make a difference.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any overlapping area or something, but since the runways are parallel and separated by 1,000 feet, their areas don't overlap. So, indeed, the total asphalt area is just the sum of the individual areas.\n\nTherefore, the total area of asphalt required is 7,200,000 square feet.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the units. Sometimes, large areas like this are expressed in acres or square meters. For completeness, I could convert this to acres.\n\nI know that one acre is equal to 43,560 square feet. So, to convert square feet to acres:\n\nAcres = total area in square feet / 43,560\n\nAcres = 7,200,000 / 43,560\nAcres \u2248 165.29 acres\n\nSo, approximately 165.29 acres of asphalt would be needed.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express this in square meters, I need to know that one square foot is approximately 0.092903 square meters.\n\nSquare meters = total area in square feet \u00d7 0.092903\nSquare meters = 7,200,000 \u00d7 0.092903\nSquare meters \u2248 668,901.6 square meters\n\nSo, roughly 668,901.6 square meters.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify the units, and the given dimensions were in feet, it's probably acceptable to leave the answer in square feet.\n\nJust to make sure I haven't missed anything, let's think about the upgrade of the existing runways again. If upgrading doesn't involve replacing the asphalt, then maybe only the new runway requires new asphalt. But the problem says \"upgrading all runways to handle heavier aircraft,\" which likely involves some sort of surface improvement, probably including new asphalt. Therefore, my initial assumption seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are taxiways or other areas that need asphalt, but the problem specifically mentions the runways, so I think focusing on the runways is sufficient.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the runway shoulders. Often, runways have shoulders on either side that are also paved. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about shoulders, so I'll assume that only the runway surfaces themselves are being considered.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that the new runway is being built 1,000 feet away from the existing ones. If there are any areas where the new runway approaches the existing runways, there might be overlapping safety areas that require additional asphalt, but given that they are parallel and separated by 1,000 feet, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, airport design guidelines specify certain safety distances between runways, and 1,000 feet might be appropriate for the type of operations they anticipate. But again, for the asphalt area calculation, this shouldn't affect the total area unless there are overlapping regions, which there aren't in this scenario.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total area of asphalt required for the three runways is 7,200,000 square feet, or approximately 165.29 acres.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7200000 \\text{ square feet}} \\]"
