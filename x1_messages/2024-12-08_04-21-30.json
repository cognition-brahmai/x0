Each step in your plan should correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be either the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\nWebSearch[input]: This tool allows users to search for information on the internet. It is useful for finding websites that may contain answers to the user's questions. The function does not directly provide answers; it returns a list of sites that might.\nTextExtractor[input]: This tool extracts text from a webpage. Input is a URL and output is plain text content of the page.\nLinkFinder[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text response with newline-separated links.\nAIAnswerer[input]: An AI model capable of answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question referencing a #E[n] variable, e.g., \"What is the capital of France, given #E1?\"\n\nThe input to each function should be a simple string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., AIAnswerer[Who won the 2019 World Series, given #E2?]\n\nEnsure only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nOutput format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n#E0 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function to call and input parameter, possibly including reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: #E[n], where n is the final evidence number\n\nQuestion: Who was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest and what challenges did they face?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest and what challenges they faced. I think the best way to start is by doing a web search to find some reliable sources that talk about the first ascent of Mount Everest.\n\nSo, my first step is to use the WebSearch tool with the query \"first ascent of Mount Everest.\" That should give me a list of websites that discuss this topic.\n\nOnce I have those websites, I'll need to pick one or maybe two that look the most reliable and extract the text from them using the TextExtractor tool. Maybe I can look for websites like National Geographic, BBC, or history websites that are known for providing accurate information.\n\nAfter I have the text from these websites, I can use the AIAnswerer tool to answer my specific questions: who was the first person to reach the summit and what challenges did they face. I'll make sure to reference the extracted text in my question to the AIAnswerer so it has the context it needs.\n\nLet me outline this step by step.\n\nFirst, perform a web search for \"first ascent of Mount Everest.\"\n\nThen, from the search results, choose a couple of reliable-looking URLs and use the TextExtractor tool on them to get the plain text content.\n\nNext, use the AIAnswerer tool with the extracted text as context to answer my questions.\n\nI might also need to find specific links from the web search results, so perhaps I can use the LinkFinder tool to extract URLs from the search results.\n\nWait, actually, the WebSearch tool probably already provides URLs in its output. So maybe I don't need LinkFinder for this task.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Use WebSearch[\"first ascent of Mount Everest\"] to find relevant websites.\n\n2. Examine the output from WebSearch and select a few URLs that look reliable.\n\n3. Use TextExtractor on those URLs to get the text content.\n\n4. Use AIAnswerer with the text from TextExtractor to answer \"Who was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest and what challenges did they face, given #E0?\"\n\nBut maybe I should consider that the first ascent involved a team, and I need to know who the first individual was to reach the summit.\n\nAlternatively, I should look for information about the 1953 Everest expedition led by John Hunt, which is widely known for being the first successful ascent.\n\nWait, perhaps I can specify the search query more precisely: \"first persons to reach summit of Mount Everest\" or \"historical first ascent of Mount Everest.\"\n\nI should also consider that there might have been earlier attempts that are part of the history.\n\nMaybe I should broaden the search a bit to understand the context better.\n\nAlternatively, I can just proceed with the initial plan and see what the search yields.\n\nLet me proceed with the plan as outlined.\n\nFirst action: WebSearch[\"first ascent of Mount Everest\"]\n\nThen, based on the output of that, extract text from relevant URLs.\n\nFinally, use AIAnswerer with that text to answer the specific question.\n\nI think that should work.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo answer the question \"Who was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest and what challenges did they face?\", follow these steps:\n\n1. **Web Search for Information:**\n   - Use the `WebSearch` tool with the query \"first ascent of Mount Everest\" to find relevant websites.\n\n2. **Extract Text from Reliable Sources:**\n   - From the search results, select a few reliable URLs and use the `TextExtractor` tool to extract the text content.\n\n3. **Answer the Question Using AI:**\n   - Use the `AIAnswerer` tool with the extracted text as context to answer the specific question about who was the first person to reach the summit and the challenges they faced.\n\n### Plan\n1. Perform a web search to find information about the first ascent of Mount Everest.\n   - `#E0 = WebSearch[\"first ascent of Mount Everest\"]`\n\n2. Extract text from the most reliable-looking URLs obtained from the web search.\n   - `#E1 = TextExtractor[URL1]`\n   - `#E2 = TextExtractor[URL2]`\n\n3. Use the AIAnswerer tool to answer the question based on the extracted text.\n   - `#E3 = AIAnswerer[Who was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest and what challenges did they face, given #E1 and #E2?]`\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{\\#E3} \\]"
