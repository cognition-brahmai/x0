        "content": "So there are 20 people at this party, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total. Hmm, this sounds like a problem about combinations, where order doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have a group of people and you want to pair them up for handshakes, the order doesn't matter. That is, if Person A shakes hands with Person B, it's the same as Person B shaking hands with Person A. So, it's not like a situation where order matters, like permutations.\n\nI think the formula for combinations is helpful here. The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to order is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, n is the total number of people, which is 20, and k is the number of people involved in each handshake, which is 2, since handshakes are between two people.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20 - 2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2! \\times 18!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can simplify this. The factorial of 20 (20!) is 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!, and the 18! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out.\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18!}{2! \\times 18!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2!}\n\\]\n\nAnd 2! is 2 \u00d7 1, which is 2.\n\n\\[\nC(20, 2) = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = \\frac{380}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 190 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe using the concept of graph theory, where each person is a vertex and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices. In that case, the number of handshakes would be equal to the number of edges in a complete graph with 20 vertices.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of edges} = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in n = 20:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of edges} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nOkay, that matches the previous calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to visualize it with smaller numbers and see if the formula holds. For example, if there are 3 people at the party, the number of handshakes should be 3.\n\nLet's check with the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(3, 2) = \\frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \\frac{6}{2 \\times 1} = 3\n\\]\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each pair of people shakes hands once.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 people:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6\n\\]\n\nAnd indeed, with 4 people, there are 6 possible handshakes.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to 20 people, it should be 190 handshakes.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can use another approach. Let's see.\n\nEach of the 20 people shakes hands with 19 other people. So, at first glance, it might seem like there are 20 \u00d7 19 = 380 handshakes. However, this counts each handshake twice, once for each participant. So, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, I need to divide by 2.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total handshakes} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same answer. This reinforces that 190 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the sequence of handshakes. The first person shakes hands with 19 others. The second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 18 remaining people. The third has already shaken with the first two, so they shake hands with 17 people, and so on, down to the last person who doesn't shake hands with anyone new because they've already shaken hands with everyone.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be:\n\n19 + 18 + 17 + ... + 1\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term a_1 = 19, the last term a_n = 1, and the number of terms n = 19.\n\nThe sum S of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{19(19 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{19 \\times 20}{2} = 190\n\\]\n\nOnce again, 190 handshakes.\n\nIt's reassuring that no matter which approach I take, I end up with the same number. This gives me confidence that 190 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of double-counting or missing some handshakes. In the combination approach, each handshake is uniquely paired with a distinct pair of people, so no double-counting there. In the handshake sequence method, we make sure to subtract those who have already shaken hands, so no double-counting there either.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that at a party with 20 people, where each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, there are a total of 190 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]"
