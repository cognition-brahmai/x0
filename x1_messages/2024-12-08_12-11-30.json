        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence where each term is twice the previous term minus 5, and the first term is 10. I need to find the sixth term. Okay, so let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the first term, let's call it term 1, is 10.\n\nNow, according to the rule, each term is twice the previous term minus 5. So, to find term 2, I'll take twice term 1 and subtract 5.\n\nTerm 2 = 2 * term 1 - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15.\n\nAlright, term 2 is 15.\n\nNext, term 3 would be twice term 2 minus 5.\n\nTerm 3 = 2 * term 2 - 5 = 2 * 15 - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25.\n\nSo, term 3 is 25.\n\nNow, term 4 is twice term 3 minus 5.\n\nTerm 4 = 2 * term 3 - 5 = 2 * 25 - 5 = 50 - 5 = 45.\n\nTerm 4 is 45.\n\nThen, term 5 is twice term 4 minus 5.\n\nTerm 5 = 2 * term 4 - 5 = 2 * 45 - 5 = 90 - 5 = 85.\n\nTerm 5 is 85.\n\nFinally, term 6 is twice term 5 minus 5.\n\nTerm 6 = 2 * term 5 - 5 = 2 * 85 - 5 = 170 - 5 = 165.\n\nSo, the sixth term is 165.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I've applied the rule correctly each time.\n\nStarting with term 1: 10.\n\nTerm 2: 2*10 - 5 = 15. That seems right.\n\nTerm 3: 2*15 - 5 = 25. Correct.\n\nTerm 4: 2*25 - 5 = 45. Good.\n\nTerm 5: 2*45 - 5 = 85. Okay.\n\nTerm 6: 2*85 - 5 = 170 - 5 = 165. Yep, that looks correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula I can use to find the nth term directly, but since the sequence is defined recursively, maybe it's simpler to just keep applying the rule step by step.\n\nI think that's the most straightforward way to approach this problem.\n\nSo, the sixth term is 165.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]"
