The question seems to be a riddle or a brain teaser, and the answer might not be as straightforward as it appears.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\n1. **The stove**: This could be a gas stove or an electric one. Lighting a gas stove usually involves turning on the gas and then igniting it with a match. For an electric stove, you wouldn't typically \"light\" it; you'd turn it on.\n\n2. **The fireplace**: This would involve lighting kindling or newspaper placed within the fireplace to start a fire.\n\n3. **The candle**: This is straightforward; you would hold the match to the wick of the candle to light it.\n\nThe question is: Which do you light first?\n\nGiven that you enter the room with only one match, you need to decide which of these three you should light first.\n\nOne possible answer is that you should light the match first. After all, before you can use the match to light any of the other items, you need to have the match lit. So, in a literal sense, the match is what you light first.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider which of the three (stove, fireplace, candle) should be the first to be lit in sequence. For example, if you need light immediately, you might light the candle first. If you need heat, you might start with the fireplace. If you need to cook something, you might go for the stove.\n\nHowever, since the question is phrased as \"which do you light first,\" and considering that you have only one match, you need to choose which one to light with that single match.\n\nIn practical terms, lighting the candle first might make sense because it's the easiest to light with a match, and once the candle is lit, you can use it to light the other items without needing additional matches.\n\nAlternatively, if the fireplace is the ultimate goal for heating the room, you might try to light the fireplace directly with the match, but this could be more challenging depending on how the fireplace is set up.\n\nThe stove might be another option, but again, it depends on the type of stove. A gas stove typically has a pilot light or an igniter, so you might not need to use a match to light it.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most straightforward answer seems to be that you should light the match first, as that is the tool you need to light any of the other items.\n\nHowever, many people interpret this riddle as a trick question, and the answer they expect is that you light the match first.\n\nSo, in conclusion, you should light the match first.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{the match}} \\]"
