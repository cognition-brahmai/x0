And I need to find out the probability that it will rain on exactly 2 out of the next 4 days. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that probability can be a bit tricky, but I think this might involve something called the binomial probability formula. I remember that the binomial formula is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure.\n\nIn this case, each day is a trial, and \"success\" would be rain on that day. The probability of success (rain) is 0.3, and the probability of failure (no rain) is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. We have 4 trials (days), and we want exactly 2 successes (rainy days).\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = C(n,k) \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (4 days),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successes (2 rainy days),\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (0.3),\n\n- \\( C(n,k) \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(2) = C(4,2) \\times 0.3^2 \\times 0.7^{2} \\]\n\nI need to calculate \\( C(4,2) \\). I know that \\( C(n,k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\), so:\n\n\\[ C(4,2) = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( 0.3^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.3^2 = 0.09 \\]\n\nAnd \\( 0.7^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.7^2 = 0.49 \\]\n\nNow, multiply them all together:\n\n\\[ P(2) = 6 \\times 0.09 \\times 0.49 \\]\n\nFirst, multiply 6 and 0.09:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 0.09 = 0.54 \\]\n\nThen, multiply that by 0.49:\n\n\\[ 0.54 \\times 0.49 = 0.2646 \\]\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on exactly 2 out of the next 4 days is 0.2646, or 26.46%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to list all possible sequences of rain and no rain over 4 days, and count how many of those have exactly 2 rainy days.\n\nEach day can be either rain (R) or no rain (N), so there are \\( 2^4 = 16 \\) possible sequences.\n\nThe sequences with exactly 2 R's are:\n\n1. RRNN\n\n2. RNRN\n\n3. RNNR\n\n4. NRRN\n\n5. NRNR\n\n6. NNRR\n\nThat's 6 sequences, which matches the \\( C(4,2) = 6 \\) calculation earlier.\n\nNow, the probability of any one of these sequences occurring is \\( 0.3^2 \\times 0.7^2 = 0.09 \\times 0.49 = 0.0441 \\).\n\nSince there are 6 such sequences, the total probability is \\( 6 \\times 0.0441 = 0.2646 \\), which matches what I got before.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 0.2646 is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the binomial probability formula directly on a calculator or look up the values, but doing it step by step helps me understand what's going on.\n\nIt's important to note that the trials are independent, meaning the outcome of one day doesn't affect the next day. That's why we can multiply the probabilities together.\n\nAlso, the probability remains constant at 0.3 for each day, which is a assumption of the binomial model.\n\nIn real life, weather patterns might be more complex, with rain on one day affecting the probability of rain on subsequent days, but for this problem, we're assuming independence.\n\nSo, to summarize, using the binomial probability formula, the probability of exactly 2 rainy days out of 4 is 0.2646.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2646} \\]"
