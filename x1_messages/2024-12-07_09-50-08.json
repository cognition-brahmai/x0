        "content": "I'm trying to solve this problem: There are 100 people in a room, and each person has an even number of friends within the group. I need to find the minimum number of people who have exactly two friends. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. There are 100 people, and each one has an even number of friends among these 100. So, possible numbers of friends for each person could be 0, 2, 4, 6, ..., up to 98 (since they can't be friends with themselves, assuming no self-friendship).\n\nThe question is asking for the minimum number of people who have exactly two friends. That means I need to minimize the number of people with exactly two friends, given that everyone has an even number of friends.\n\nI think graph theory might be useful here. If I imagine each person as a vertex in a graph, and each friendship as an edge connecting two vertices, then this becomes a graph where each vertex has an even degree (since the number of friends is the degree of the vertex).\n\nSo, I need to find a graph with 100 vertices, all of even degree, and minimize the number of vertices with degree exactly 2.\n\nFirst, I recall that in any graph, the sum of all degrees is equal to twice the number of edges. Also, in this case, since all degrees are even, the graph must satisfy that.\n\nI wonder if it's possible for all 100 people to have 0 friends. That would mean no edges at all, and all degrees are 0, which is even. But is that allowed? The problem says \"each person has an even number of friends,\" and 0 is even, so yes, that's a possible configuration. However, the question is probably assuming that there are some friendships, so maybe that's not the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for some people to have 0 friends, but it's not specified that there must be at least one friendship. In that case, the minimal number of people with exactly two friends could be zero, if everyone has 0 friends.\n\nBut that seems too trivial. Maybe the problem expects that there are some people with positive number of friends. Perhaps I should assume that the friendship graph is connected, meaning that there's a path between any two people through friendships.\n\nAssuming the graph is connected, what would be the minimal number of people with exactly two friends?\n\nIn a connected graph, having all degrees even means it's an Eulerian graph, meaning there's a cycle that visits every edge exactly once.\n\nBut I need to minimize the number of vertices with degree exactly 2.\n\nI recall that in trees, which are connected graphs with no cycles, all leaves have degree 1. But in this problem, degrees are even, so no vertex can have degree 1. Therefore, the graph cannot be a tree.\n\nSo, the graph must contain cycles.\n\nIn a cycle graph, all vertices have degree 2. So, if the graph is one big cycle, then all 100 people have exactly two friends. But that's not minimizing the number of people with exactly two friends.\n\nTo minimize the number of people with exactly two friends, I need to maximize the number of people with higher even degrees.\n\nMaybe I can have some vertices with higher degrees and others with degree 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of components. If the graph is allowed to have multiple connected components, then I can have some components where most vertices have higher degrees and some components with cycles where vertices have degree 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"each person has an even number of friends within the group,\" without specifying connectivity. So, the graph could have multiple connected components.\n\nTo minimize the number of people with exactly two friends, perhaps I should maximize the number of people in components where most vertices have higher degrees.\n\nFor example, consider complete graphs where all degrees are even. In a complete graph with n vertices, each vertex has degree n-1. For n-1 to be even, n must be odd.\n\nBut I need even degrees, so n-1 is even, meaning n is odd.\n\nHowever, complete graphs have high degrees, which is good for my goal of maximizing degrees beyond 2.\n\nBut complete graphs have degrees n-1, which for n=3 (triangle) is 2, which is what I'm trying to minimize.\n\nWait, in a triangle, every vertex has degree 2. That's not helping to reduce the number of people with degree 2.\n\nMaybe I need to consider higher complete graphs, like K_5, where each vertex has degree 4.\n\nIn K_5, there are 5 vertices, each with degree 4. That's better, as degrees are higher than 2.\n\nSo, if I have as many people as possible in K_5 subgraphs, that would reduce the number of people with degree 2.\n\nBut 100 is divisible by 5, so I can have 20 disjoint K_5 graphs.\n\nIn each K_5, all 5 vertices have degree 4.\n\nSo, in this configuration, all 100 people have degree 4, which is even, and no one has degree 2.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for multiple connected components, so this seems acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the graph to be connected.\n\nIf the graph must be connected, then having multiple disjoint K_5's isn't allowed.\n\nAssuming the graph is connected, how can I minimize the number of vertices with degree 2?\n\nIn a connected graph where all degrees are even, to minimize the number of degree-2 vertices, I should maximize the degrees of as many vertices as possible.\n\nPerhaps having one central vertex connected to many others, but in this case, since degrees must be even, I need to ensure that all degrees remain even.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can have a structure where there are several high-degree vertices connected in a way that most vertices have higher degrees, and only a few have degree 2.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of Eulerian graphs.\n\nIn an Eulerian graph, all degrees are even, and the graph is connected.\n\nI need to find such a graph with 100 vertices and minimize the number of vertices with degree exactly 2.\n\nI recall that in Eulerian graphs, if there are vertices with degree greater than 2, then there must be enough of them to make the sum of degrees even.\n\nBut I need to minimize the number of degree-2 vertices.\n\nLet me consider starting with a single high-degree vertex and connecting it to others.\n\nBut in that case, the central vertex has a high degree, but the connected vertices would have degree 1, which is odd, which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, degree 1 is odd, so that's not permitted.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to connect each vertex to at least one other vertex to keep degrees even.\n\nWait, no, degree 0 is even, but if I have a vertex connected to only one other, that would have degree 1, which is odd.\n\nSo, to avoid odd degrees, every vertex must have even degree, including 0.\n\nBut if I have a vertex connected to only one other, that would have degree 1, which is odd, so that's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, every vertex must have degree 0 or at least 2.\n\nBut if I have a vertex with degree 0, it's not connected to any other vertex.\n\nIf the graph is allowed to have multiple components, then some vertices can have degree 0.\n\nBut perhaps to minimize the number of degree-2 vertices, I should maximize the number of degree-0 vertices.\n\nWait, but degree-0 vertices don't affect the degrees of others, so maybe I can have as many degree-0 vertices as possible, and the remaining form a connected component where degrees are higher than 2.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize the number of people with exactly two friends, which are the degree-2 vertices.\n\nSo, if I have more degree-0 vertices, that reduces the number of degree-2 vertices, since fewer people are in the connected component where degrees are higher.\n\nWait, no, actually, degree-0 vertices don't participate in any friendships, so they don't affect the connected component.\n\nSo, perhaps I can have as many degree-0 vertices as possible, and the remaining form a connected component where degrees are all even and at least 4.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nSuppose I have k vertices with degree at least 4, and the remaining 100 - k vertices have degree 0.\n\nThen, in the connected component with k vertices, all degrees are even and at least 4.\n\nI need this connected component to be connected, and all degrees even and at least 4.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWell, in a connected graph with all degrees even and at least 4, I need to ensure that such a graph exists.\n\nBut I'm not sure if such graphs exist for arbitrary k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that in a connected graph with all degrees at least 4, the number of edges is constrained.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use the handshaking lemma, which states that the sum of all degrees is twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, since all degrees are even, the sum of degrees is even.\n\nLet me denote by n_0 the number of vertices with degree 0, n_2 the number with degree 2, n_4 the number with degree 4, and so on.\n\nThen, the sum of degrees is 0*n_0 + 2*n_2 + 4*n_4 + ... = 2*(number of edges).\n\nAlso, n_0 + n_2 + n_4 + ... = 100.\n\nI need to minimize n_2.\n\nTo minimize n_2, I need to maximize the sum contributed by higher degree vertices.\n\nSo, I should maximize n_4, n_6, etc.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the sum remains even.\n\nLet me consider\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6211\u8ba9\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u5ea6\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u6570\u662f100\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u4ee5\u670998\u4e2a\u670b\u53cb\uff08\u9664\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\uff09\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u6240\u6709\u5ea6\u6570\u90fd\u662f\u5076\u6570\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5ea6\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f0,2,4,...,98\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u5316n_2\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u6700\u5927\u5316n_4, n_6\u7b49\u3002\n\n\u5047\u8bbe\u6211\u6709\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684n_4\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u5ea6\u6570\u4e3a4\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u3002\n\n\u8bben_4 = m\uff0c\u7136\u540en_0 = 100 -

No, n_2 cannot be negative.\n\nSo, n_2 = 0 seems possible.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the graph to be connected, in which case having 20 disjoint K_5's isn't connected.\n\nIf the graph must be connected, then n_2 cannot be zero.\n\nWait, why do I think that?\n\nActually, a single connected component where all degrees are even and greater than or equal to 4 is possible.\n\nFor example, consider a cycle of 4 vertices, each with degree 2, but that's not allowed because we want to minimize n_2.\n\nWait, no, in a cycle of 4, each vertex has degree 2, which is what we're trying to minimize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can have a structure where there are vertices with higher degrees.\n\nFor example, consider a star graph, but in a star graph, the central vertex has degree 99, which is odd, so that's not allowed.\n\nWait, 99 is odd, so that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can have a graph where some vertices have higher even degrees.\n\nBut constructing such a graph manually seems tedious.\n\nMaybe I need to think in terms of graph operations or known graph types.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of Eulerian graphs.\n\nIn an Eulerian graph, all degrees are even, and the graph is connected.\n\nI need to find an Eulerian graph with 100 vertices and minimize the number of vertices with degree exactly 2.\n\nI recall that in Eulerian graphs, there are algorithms to find Eulerian cycles, but I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the graph's structure in terms of its components.\n\nBut wait, the problem might allow for multiple connected components, as it doesn't specify connectivity.\n\nIn that case, the minimal n_2 is zero, achieved by having 20 disjoint K_5's, as I earlier proposed.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the graph to be connected.\n\nLet me assume that the graph is connected.\n\nThen, I need to find a connected Eulerian graph with 100 vertices, all degrees even, and minimize the number of vertices with degree exactly 2.\n\nHow can I approach this?\n\nPerhaps I can start with a graph where most vertices have higher degrees and a few have degree 2.\n\nFor example, consider a graph where there is a central cycle that connects all vertices, but that would result in many vertices having degree 2.\n\nWait, no, if I have a central cycle with some vertices having higher degrees, it might be possible to reduce n_2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can have a tree structure where some vertices have higher degrees.\n\nBut trees have leaves with degree 1, which is odd, so that's not allowed.\n\nSo, I need to ensure all degrees are even.\n\nMaybe I can think of a \"multi-center\" structure where there are several high-degree vertices connected in a way that forms a connected graph with minimal degree-2 vertices.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps there's a formula or theorem that can help here.\n\nI recall that in any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.\n\nBut in this case, all degrees are even, so that's satisfied.\n\nIs there another property that can help me find the minimal number of degree-2 vertices?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of graph transformations to reduce n_2.\n\nFor example, if I have a vertex with degree 4, I can maybe split it into two vertices of degree 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum of degrees.\n\nIn the connected Eulerian graph with 100 vertices, the sum of degrees is 2E, where E is the number of edges.\n\nI need to minimize n_2, given that the sum of degrees is 2E and all degrees are even.\n\nLet me denote n_k as the number of vertices with degree k.\n\nSo, sum_{k even} k*n_k = 2E.\n\nAnd n_0 + n_2 + n_4 + ... = 100.\n\nI need to minimize n_2.\n\nTo minimize n_2, I need to maximize the sum contributed by higher k's.\n\nSo, I should maximize n_4, n_6, etc.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the graph remains connected.\n\nLet me consider having one vertex with degree 98 (which is even), and the remaining 99 vertices with degree 0.\n\nBut then the graph is not connected, since only one vertex is connected to others, but in this case, the degrees would be 98 for one vertex and 0 for others, which sums up correctly, but the graph is not connected.\n\nSo, assuming connectivity, is there a way to have one vertex with high degree and others with lower degrees?\n\nBut if one vertex is connected to many others, those others would have degree at least 1, which is odd, so to make them even, they need at least degree 2.\n\nSo, if I have one vertex connected to 98 others, then those 98 vertices have degree at least 1, which is odd, so they need at least one more connection to make their degree even.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of graph expansions or extensions.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider starting from a graph where all degrees are higher than 2 and then adjust to make degrees even.\n\nBut that seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a connected graph with all degrees even, the minimal number of degree-2 vertices is zero, achieved by having all degrees higher than 2.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nIn a connected graph with 100 vertices, can I have all degrees at least 4?\n\nWell, the sum of degrees would be at least 4*100 = 400, so the number of edges would be at least 200.\n\nBut is such a graph possible?\n\nI think so, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the following:\n\nIn any connected graph with all degrees even, the minimal number of degree-2 vertices is zero, achievable by having all degrees higher than 2, provided that such a graph exists.\n\nGiven that, the minimal n_2 is zero.\n\nBut perhaps there's a lower bound on n_2 based on the number of vertices or other properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the structure of the graph in more detail.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the following:\n\nSuppose I have a connected graph with 100 vertices, all degrees even.\n\nI need to minimize the number of vertices with degree exactly 2.\n\nI can try to maximize the number of vertices with degree greater than or equal to 4.\n\nLet me assume that I have k vertices with degree at least 4, and the remaining 100 - k vertices have degree 0 or 2.\n\nBut since the graph is connected, vertices with degree 0 cannot be part of the connected component, so perhaps in the connected component, all degrees are at least 2.\n\nWait, but in a connected graph, it's possible to have vertices with degree 0 if the graph has multiple components, but the problem might expect a single connected component.\n\nAssuming the graph is connected, then all vertices must have degree at least 2.\n\nIn that case, the minimal degree for all vertices is 2.\n\nSo, in a connected graph with all degrees even, and minimal degrees of 2, then n_2 could be as low as possible by maximizing higher degrees.\n\nBut how low can n_2 be?\n\nLet me consider that in a connected graph with all degrees at least 2, the minimal number of degree-2 vertices depends on the structure.\n\nPerhaps I can think in terms of trees again, but in trees, degrees are at least 1, and in this case, degrees are at least 2, so it's different.\n\nWait, in a cycle graph, all vertices have degree 2.\n\nSo, a cycle graph with 100 vertices has all degrees 2.\n\nBut I need to minimize n_2, so I need to deviate from this.\n\nMaybe I can add edges to the cycle to increase some degrees.\n\nFor example, start with a cycle of 100 vertices, each with degree 2.\n\nThen, add edges to increase some degrees beyond 2.\n\nEach time I add an edge, I increase the degrees of two vertices by 1.\n\nSo, to make some vertices have higher even degrees, I need to add edges in such a way that degrees remain even.\n\nFor example, if I have two vertices with degree 2, and I connect them with an additional edge, their degrees become 3, which is odd, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider adding edges between vertices in a way that maintains even degrees.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a connected graph with all degrees even, the number of degree-2 vertices is related to the number of cycles or something similar.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a connected Eulerian graph, the number of degree-2 vertices cannot be less than a certain number.\n\nBut I don't know such a theorem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a connected graph with all degrees even, the minimal number of degree-2 vertices is zero, achievable by constructing a graph where all degrees are at least 4.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nI think it is, for example, by having multiple cycles sharing vertices in a way that degrees are increased.\n\nBut without a specific construction, it's hard to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider a complete graph with an appropriate number of vertices, but as earlier thought, complete graphs have degrees n-1, which is even when n is odd.\n\nSo, for n=5, degrees are 4, which is fine.\n\nBut in K_5, all degrees are 4, which is better than 2.\n\nBut K_5 has 5 vertices, and I have 100 vertices.\n\nSo, perhaps I can have multiple K_5's, but if the graph is required to be connected, then having multiple disjoint K_5's isn't allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to connect these K_5's in a way that maintains even degrees.\n\nFor example, connecting one vertex from each K_5 to a central vertex.\n\nBut then the central vertex would have degree equal to the number of K_5's, which is 20, since 100/5=20.\n\nSo, the central vertex would have degree 20, which is even, and each K_5 vertex would have degree 5 (from K_5) plus 1 from the connection to the central vertex, making degree 6, which is even.\n\nWait, in K_5, each vertex has degree 4.\n\nAdding one more edge to connect to the central vertex makes degree 5, which is odd.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo, in this construction, degrees would become odd, which isn't allowed.\n\nTherefore, this construction doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can connect two K_5's by adding an edge between two vertices of different K_5's.\n\nIn that case, the two vertices involved would have their degrees increased by 1, from 4 to 5, which is odd, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo, that doesn't work either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can connect two K_5's by adding two edges between different pairs of vertices.\n\nThat way, the degrees of the four involved vertices would increase by 1 each, making them degree 5, which is still odd.\n\nThat doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can add edges in a way that compensates for the odd degrees.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of graph modifications to maintain even degrees.\n\nFor example, starting from a graph where all degrees are even, and performing operations that preserve the evenness of degrees.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps with minimizing n_2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of linear algebra, setting up equations for the degrees and solving for minimal n_2.\n\nBut that might be too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a lower bound on n_2 based on graph properties.\n\nBut I don't know of such a lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a connected graph with all degrees even, there must be at least some number of degree-2 vertices.\n\nBut I don't know what that number is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n_2 is zero, achievable by having a connected graph where all degrees are at least 4.\n\nBut I'm not sure if such a graph exists for 100 vertices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a connected graph with all degrees even, the minimal number of degree-2 vertices is related to the number of leaves in a spanning tree, but since degrees are even, leaves (degree 1) are not allowed.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nPerhaps I should consider specific examples.\n\nLet's consider a smaller case, say 4 people.\n\nIf I have 4 people, and each has an even number of friends, what's the minimal number who have exactly two friends?\n\nPossible configurations:\n\n- All four have degree 0: n_2 = 0.\n\n- All four have degree 2: a cycle, n_2 = 4.\n\n- Two have degree 0 and two have degree 2: n_2 = 2.\n\n- Other configurations are not possible without having odd degrees.\n\nSo, in this case, minimal n_2 is 0.\n\nSimilarly, for 100 people, it seems that n_2 can be zero if I have multiple disjoint K_5's, as earlier thought.\n\nBut if the graph must be connected, then perhaps n_2 cannot be zero.\n\nIn the 4-person case, if the graph is connected, then n_2 cannot be zero, because if all have degree >=4, but with only 4 vertices, that's not possible (since degree can't exceed 3).\n\nWait, in a 4-vertex graph, maximum degree is 3.\n\nSo, if all degrees are even and >=4, that's impossible.\n\nHence, in the 4-vertex connected graph, n_2 must be at least 4, meaning all have degree 2.\n\nBut wait, in a 4-vertex connected graph with all degrees even, the only possibility is a cycle of 4, where each has degree 2.\n\nSo, in this case, n_2 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, for 100 vertices, perhaps the minimal n_2 is 100, meaning all have degree 2.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that n_2 can be zero if the graph doesn't have to be connected.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the graph to be connected.\n\nIf that's the case, then in a connected graph with all degrees even, the minimal n_2 is 100, meaning everyone has exactly two friends.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are ways to have a connected graph with all degrees even and n_2 less than 100.\n\nWait, perhaps I can have some vertices with higher degrees.\n\nFor example, consider a cycle of 98 vertices, each with degree 2, and two vertices outside the cycle connected to the cycle in a way that maintains even degrees.\n\nBut I need to ensure connectivity and even degrees.\n\nThis is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider a graph that is a cycle with chords added in a way that maintains even degrees.\n\nBut again, it's not clear.\n\nPerhaps I need to accept that in a connected graph with all degrees even, the minimal n_2 is zero, achievable by having some vertices with higher even degrees.\n\nBut I need to confirm if such a graph exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n_2 is 0, meaning that it's possible to have a connected graph with 100 vertices, all degrees even, and some vertices having degrees higher than 2, thus minimizing n_2 to zero.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that in a connected graph with all degrees even, n_2 could be zero.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of people who have exactly two friends is zero.\n\nBut the problem might expect a different answer, assuming that the graph is connected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n_2 is 0, achievable by having multiple disjoint K_5's, as in the earlier example.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the minimal number of people who have exactly two friends is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
