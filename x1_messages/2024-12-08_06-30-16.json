Each plan will associate with an evidence value, which is the product of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user's question, earlier evidence values, or both.\n\nTools at disposal:\nYahooSearch[input]: A tool enabling the user to seek information through Yahoo Search. This tool assists in identifying appropriate sites that may hold the answer to the user's inquiry.\nPageLoader[input]: Fetches one or more websites from the input string containing newline-separated links. The input consists of one or more links, producing plain text output encompassing the content of these links.\nURLGatherer[input]: Retrieves links from plain text, generating a plain text, newline-separated response of links.\nQAEngine[input]: A question-answering language model, adept at answering inquiries based on an input text passage. The input has to be a text-based question referring to an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [Initial action predicated on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to invoke with input parameter]\nPlan: [Subsequent action contingent upon result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Following function to invoke and input parameter, potentially citing prior evidence, e.g., \"In light of :evidence0:\"]\n...\nUltimate Response: [:evidence[n]: carrying the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the telephone and what patents do they hold?"
