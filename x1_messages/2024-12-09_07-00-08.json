        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about planning a new sports complex. There's a total budget of $5 million, and it's going to include a soccer field, basketball courts, and a swimming pool. The budget is allocated as follows: 40% for the soccer field, 30% for the basketball courts, and 30% for the swimming pool. I need to calculate the individual budgets for each facility and then estimate the total area of land required for the complex, given the average cost per square foot for each facility.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much money is allocated to each facility. Let's start with the soccer field. It's getting 40% of the $5 million budget.\n\nSo, the soccer field budget is 40% of $5,000,000.\n\nTo calculate that, I can multiply 5,000,000 by 0.40.\n\n5,000,000 * 0.40 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, the soccer field has a budget of $2,000,000.\n\nNext, the basketball courts are getting 30% of the budget.\n\n30% of $5,000,000 is 5,000,000 * 0.30 = 1,500,000.\n\nSo, the basketball courts have a budget of $1,500,000.\n\nSimilarly, the swimming pool also gets 30% of the budget.\n\nAgain, 30% of $5,000,000 is $1,500,000.\n\nSo, the swimming pool has a budget of $1,500,000.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the total area of land required for the complex. I'm given the average cost per square foot for each facility: $100 for the soccer field, $150 for the basketball courts, and $200 for the swimming pool.\n\nTo find the area for each facility, I can divide the budget for each by its respective cost per square foot.\n\nStarting with the soccer field:\n\nArea of soccer field = budget / cost per square foot = 2,000,000 / 100 = 20,000 square feet.\n\nNext, the basketball courts:\n\nArea of basketball courts = 1,500,000 / 150 = 10,000 square feet.\n\nAnd finally, the swimming pool:\n\nArea of swimming pool = 1,500,000 / 200 = 7,500 square feet.\n\nNow, to find the total area required for the entire complex, I need to add up the areas of all three facilities.\n\nTotal area = area of soccer field + area of basketball courts + area of swimming pool = 20,000 + 10,000 + 7,500 = 37,500 square feet.\n\nSo, the total area of land required for the sports complex is 37,500 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the budgets:\n\nSoccer field: 40% of $5,000,000 is indeed $2,000,000.\n\nBasketball courts: 30% of $5,000,000 is $1,500,000.\n\nSwimming pool: 30% of $5,000,000 is $1,500,000.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, the areas:\n\nSoccer field: $2,000,000 / $100 per square foot = 20,000 square feet.\n\nBasketball courts: $1,500,000 / $150 per square foot = 10,000 square feet.\n\nSwimming pool: $1,500,000 / $200 per square foot = 7,500 square feet.\n\nAdding those up: 20,000 + 10,000 + 7,500 = 37,500 square feet.\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37500 \\text{ square feet}} \\]"
