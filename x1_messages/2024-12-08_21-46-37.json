        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains moving towards each other from Station A and Station B, which are 400 miles apart.\n\nFirst, train A leaves Station A at 9 am and travels at 60 mph towards Station B.\n\nSecond, train B leaves Station B at 11 am and travels at 80 mph towards Station A.\n\nWe need to find out when these two trains will meet.\n\nAlright, so train A has a head start. It leaves two hours before train B. So from 9 am to 11 am, train A is moving alone.\n\nLet's calculate how far train A travels in those two hours.\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nFor train A:\n\nDistance_A_first_two_hours = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nSo, by 11 am, train A has already covered 120 miles, and the remaining distance between the two trains is 400 - 120 = 280 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other starting at 11 am.\n\nThe speeds are:\n\nTrain A: 60 mph\n\nTrain B: 80 mph\n\nWhen two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nRelative speed = 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph\n\nNow, we have a remaining distance of 280 miles between them at 11 am, and they are approaching each other at 140 mph.\n\nTime taken to cover 280 miles at 140 mph is:\n\nTime = distance / relative speed = 280 miles / 140 mph = 2 hours\n\nTherefore, they will meet 2 hours after 11 am.\n\nSo, the meeting time is 11 am + 2 hours = 1 pm.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nFrom 9 am to 11 am, train A travels 120 miles.\n\nRemaining distance is 400 - 120 = 280 miles.\n\nBoth trains moving towards each other at a combined speed of 140 mph.\n\nTime to cover 280 miles at 140 mph is indeed 2 hours.\n\nSo, they meet at 11 am + 2 hours = 1 pm.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the total distance each train travels until they meet.\n\nLet\u2019s say they meet t hours after 11 am.\n\nIn that time:\n\nTrain A travels an additional 60t miles.\n\nTrain B travels 80t miles.\n\nBut train A has already traveled 120 miles by 11 am.\n\nSo, the total distance covered by both trains when they meet is:\n\n120 + 60t + 80t = 400\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n120 + 140t = 400\n\nSubtract 120 from both sides:\n\n140t = 280\n\nDivide both sides by 140:\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nAgain, they meet at 1 pm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the time from 9 am.\n\nLet\u2019s denote t as the time in hours after 9 am.\n\nThen, train A has traveled t hours, and train B has traveled (t - 2) hours.\n\nThe distances are:\n\nDistance_A = 60t miles\n\nDistance_B = 80(t - 2) miles\n\nTotal distance when they meet:\n\nDistance_A + Distance_B = 400\n\nSo:\n\n60t + 80(t - 2) = 400\n\nExpand:\n\n60t + 80t - 160 = 400\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140t - 160 = 400\n\nAdd 160 to both sides:\n\n140t = 560\n\nDivide by 140:\n\nt = 4 hours\n\nSo, from 9 am, it takes 4 hours for them to meet, which is also 1 pm.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: the trains meet at 1 pm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1\\ \\text{pm}} \\]"
