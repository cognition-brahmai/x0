To find out how many more liters are needed to fill it up completely, you can subtract the current amount of water from the tank's total capacity.\n\nSo, it would be 500 liters (total capacity) minus 300 liters (current amount) which equals 200 liters.\n\nTherefore, you need 200 more liters to fill the tank completely.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]\n"
