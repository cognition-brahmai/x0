        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains traveling on parallel tracks, one leaving Town A at 4 PM and arriving at Town B at 6 PM, and the other leaving Town B at 5 PM and arriving at Town A at 7 PM. We need to find out when they cross each other.\n\nFirst, let's gather all the information we have:\n\n- Train 1:\n\n- Leaves Town A at 4 PM\n\n- Arrives at Town B at 6 PM\n\n- Train 2:\n\n- Leaves Town B at 5 PM\n\n- Arrives at Town A at 7 PM\n\nSince both trains are traveling towards each other on parallel tracks, they will cross each other at some point between their departure and arrival times.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Town A and Town B is D miles.\n\nNow, let's find the speeds of both trains.\n\nFor Train 1:\n\n- Time taken to travel from Town A to Town B: 2 hours (from 4 PM to 6 PM)\n\n- Speed = Distance / Time = D / 2 miles per hour\n\nFor Train 2:\n\n- Time taken to travel from Town B to Town A: 2 hours (from 5 PM to 7 PM)\n\n- Speed = Distance / Time = D / 2 miles per hour\n\nWait a minute, both trains have the same speed, which is D/2 miles per hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out when they cross each other.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time when they cross each other as T PM.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the time elapsed since Train 1 departed at 4 PM.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- T = number of hours after 4 PM when they cross each other.\n\nSo, Train 1 has been traveling for T hours when they cross.\n\nTrain 2 leaves at 5 PM, which is 1 hour after Train 1. Therefore, Train 2 has been traveling for (T - 1) hours when they cross.\n\nNow, the distance covered by Train 1 in T hours is:\n\nDistance1 = (D / 2) * T\n\nThe distance covered by Train 2 in (T - 1) hours is:\n\nDistance2 = (D / 2) * (T - 1)\n\nSince they are traveling towards each other on parallel tracks, the sum of the distances they have covered when they cross should be equal to the total distance D.\n\nTherefore:\n\nDistance1 + Distance2 = D\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\n(D / 2) * T + (D / 2) * (T - 1) = D\n\nLet\u2019s factor out D/2:\n\n(D / 2) * [T + (T - 1)] = D\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(D / 2) * (2T - 1) = D\n\nNow, divide both sides by D (assuming D \u2260 0):\n\n(D / 2) * (2T - 1) / D = D / D\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1 / 2) * (2T - 1) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2T - 1 = 2\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n2T = 3\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nT = 1.5 hours\n\nSo, they cross each other 1.5 hours after 4 PM.\n\nLet\u2019s convert 1.5 hours into hours and minutes:\n\n1 hour and 0.5 hours = 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the time when they cross each other is:\n\n4 PM + 1 hour 30 minutes = 5:30 PM\n\nWait, but let's double-check this.\n\nTrain 2 leaves at 5 PM, and they cross at 5:30 PM.\n\nLet\u2019s verify the distances:\n\nTrain 1:\n\n- Speed: D / 2 miles per hour\n\n- Time: 1.5 hours\n\n- Distance: (D / 2) * 1.5 = (3D) / 4 miles\n\nTrain 2:\n\n- Speed: D / 2 miles per hour\n\n- Time: 0.5 hours (since it leaves at 5 PM and crosses at 5:30 PM)\n\n- Distance: (D / 2) * 0.5 = D / 4 miles\n\nTotal distance covered: (3D)/4 + D/4 = D miles, which matches the total distance.\n\nTherefore, our calculation is correct.\n\nThey cross each other at 5:30 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5:30 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
