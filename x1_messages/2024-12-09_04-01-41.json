        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store selling apples and oranges. Apples are $1 each, and oranges are $2 each. Alice buys a total of 20 fruits and spends exactly $30. We need to find out how many oranges she bought.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being asked. We have two types of fruits: apples and oranges, with different prices. Alice buys a combination of these fruits totaling 20 pieces and costing $30. We need to find the exact number of oranges in her purchase.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is by setting up some equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of apples.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the number of oranges.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of fruits is 20.\n\n2. The total cost is $30.\n\nSo, we can write two equations based on these pieces of information.\n\nFirst equation: total number of fruits.\n\n\\[ a + o = 20 \\]\n\nSecond equation: total cost.\n\nSince apples cost $1 each and oranges cost $2 each:\n\n\\[ 1a + 2o = 30 \\]\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( a + o = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( a + 2o = 30 \\)\n\nNow, we can solve this system to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( o \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by elimination. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \\( a \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ (a + 2o) - (a + o) = 30 - 20 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ a + 2o - a - o = 10 \\]\n\n\\[ o = 10 \\]\n\nWait, that's straightforward. So, according to this, \\( o = 10 \\). That means Alice bought 10 oranges.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf she bought 10 oranges at $2 each, that would cost:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\] dollars.\n\nThen, the remaining fruits are apples. Since total fruits are 20, and she bought 10 oranges, the number of apples is:\n\n\\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \\] apples.\n\nThe cost for apples is:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 1 = 10 \\] dollars.\n\nSo, total cost is:\n\n\\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \\] dollars, which matches the given total.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let's see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother method could be to assume all fruits are apples and see how the cost changes.\n\nIf all 20 fruits are apples, the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 1 = 20 \\] dollars.\n\nBut Alice spent $30, which is $10 more than $20.\n\nSince each orange costs $1 more than an apple, to make up the additional $10, she needs to have 10 oranges.\n\nBecause each orange replaces an apple and adds an extra dollar, so 10 oranges would add $10 to the total cost.\n\nThis matches our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, we could use substitution in the equations.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[ a = 20 - o \\]\n\nPlugging this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ (20 - o) + 2o = 30 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ 20 - o + 2o = 30 \\]\n\n\\[ 20 + o = 30 \\]\n\n\\[ o = 10 \\]\n\nAgain, we get \\( o = 10 \\).\n\nSo, regardless of the method, we keep arriving at the same answer: Alice bought 10 oranges.\n\nLet's consider if there could be other possibilities. For example, could she have bought more or fewer oranges?\n\nSuppose she bought 11 oranges. Then, the number of apples would be:\n\n\\[ 20 - 11 = 9 \\] apples.\n\nThe total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 1 + 11 \\times 2 = 9 + 22 = 31 \\] dollars, which is more than $30.\n\nSimilarly, if she bought 9 oranges:\n\n\\[ 20 - 9 = 11 \\] apples.\n\nTotal cost:\n\n\\[ 11 \\times 1 + 9 \\times 2 = 11 + 18 = 29 \\] dollars, which is less than $30.\n\nSo, only when she buys 10 oranges does the total cost come to exactly $30.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 10 oranges.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about this differently. Maybe there's a way to generalize this for future problems.\n\nSuppose the price of apples is \\( p_a \\) and oranges is \\( p_o \\). The total number of fruits is \\( n \\), and the total cost is \\( c \\).\n\nWe can set up the equations:\n\n1. \\( a + o = n \\)\n\n2. \\( p_a \\times a + p_o \\times o = c \\)\n\nIn this specific problem, \\( p_a = 1 \\), \\( p_o = 2 \\), \\( n = 20 \\), and \\( c = 30 \\).\n\nBut in general, to solve for \\( o \\), we can manipulate the equations.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\[ a = n - o \\]\n\nPlugging into equation 2:\n\n\\[ p_a (n - o) + p_o o = c \\]\n\n\\[ p_a n - p_a o + p_o o = c \\]\n\n\\[ p_a n + (p_o - p_a) o = c \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ (p_o - p_a) o = c - p_a n \\]\n\n\\[ o = \\frac{c - p_a n}{p_o - p_a} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values from this problem:\n\n\\[ o = \\frac{30 - 1 \\times 20}{2 - 1} = \\frac{30 - 20}{1} = \\frac{10}{1} = 10 \\]\n\nAgain, we get \\( o = 10 \\).\n\nThis general formula could be useful for similar problems with different values.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a straightforward problem, the answer is 10 oranges.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility that Alice bought negative numbers of fruits or fractional fruits? No, because she can't buy negative or partial fruits in this context.\n\nAlso, the problem states that she bought exactly 20 fruits and spent exactly $30, so there should be one unique solution.\n\nWe've arrived at that solution through multiple methods, and all point to 10 oranges.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 10 oranges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
