        "content": "So, there are 25 students in a classroom, and each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes that would be in total. Hmm, let's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once. So, for example, if there are two students, there's only one handshake. If there are three students, there would be three handshakes: A shakes with B, A shakes with C, and B shakes with C.\n\nWait, actually, with three students, it's not three handshakes; it's three unique pairs. Let me confirm: A shakes with B, A shakes with C, and B shakes with C\u2014yes, that's three handshakes.\n\nNow, scaling this up to 25 students seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me calculate this without having to list out every possible handshake.\n\nLet's consider a smaller number of students to look for a pattern. Suppose there are n students, and I want to find the total number of unique handshakes.\n\nFor n=1: No handshakes, since there's no one else to shake hands with.\n\nFor n=2: 1 handshake.\n\nFor n=3: 3 handshakes.\n\nFor n=4: Let's see. Student A shakes hands with B, C, and D\u2014that's three handshakes. Student B has already shaken hands with A, so they only shake hands with C and D\u2014that's two more handshakes. Student C has already shaken hands with A and B, so they only shake hands with D\u2014one more handshake. Student D has already shaken hands with A, B, and C, so no new handshakes. Total: 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6 handshakes.\n\nWait, that seems familiar. It's like adding up consecutive integers.\n\nFor n=1: 0\n\nFor n=2: 1\n\nFor n=3: 3\n\nFor n=4: 6\n\nI notice that these are triangular numbers. The formula for the nth triangular number is n(n-1)/2. So, for n=4, it's 4*3/2=6, which matches what I calculated.\n\nMaybe this formula applies here. So, for 25 students, the total number of handshakes would be 25*24/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 25*24=600, and 600/2=300.\n\nSo, there would be 300 handshakes in total.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this formula. Why does it work?\n\nWell, each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once. So, for each pair of students, there's one handshake.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 students out of 25 is the combination formula C(25,2), which is 25 choose 2.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n,k)=n! / (k!(n-k)!).\n\nSo, C(25,2)=25! / (2!(25-2)!)= (25*24*23!)/(2*1*23!)= (25*24)/2=300.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, there are 300 unique handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it differently: each of the 25 students shakes hands with 24 others, but this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of unique handshakes.\n\nSo, total handshakes= (25*24)/2=300.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]\n"
