        "content": "To determine the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-\u03c0, \u03c0], we need to find the coefficients a\u2080, a\u2099, and b\u2099 for the Fourier series expansion:\n\nf(x) = a\u2080 + \u03a3 [a\u2099 cos(nx) + b\u2099 sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for a function defined on the interval [-\u03c0, \u03c0], the Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na\u2080 = (1/(2\u03c0)) \u222b_{-\u03c0}^{\u03c0} f(x) dx\n\na\u2099 = (1/\u03c0) \u222b_{-\u03c0}^{\u03c0} f(x) cos(nx) dx\n\nb\u2099 = (1/\u03c0) \u222b_{-\u03c0}^{\u03c0} f(x) sin(nx) dx\n\nGiven that f(x) = x, let's compute each coefficient step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Compute a\u2080**\n\na\u2080 = (1/(2\u03c0)) \u222b_{-\u03c0}^{\u03c0} x dx\n\nSince x is an odd function and the interval [-\u03c0, \u03c0] is symmetric about the origin, the integral of x over this interval is zero. Therefore,\n\na\u2080 = 0\n\n**Step 2: Compute a\u2099**\n\na\u2099 = (1/\u03c0) \u222b_{-\u03c0}^{\u03c0} x cos(nx) dx\n\nAgain, x cos(nx) is an odd function (product of odd and even functions), and integrating an odd function over a symmetric interval around the origin yields zero. Hence,\n\na\u2099 = 0 for all n\n\n**Step 3: Compute b\u2099**\n\nb\u2099 = (1/\u03c0) \u222b_{-\u03c0}^{\u03c0} x sin(nx) dx\n\nThis time, x sin(nx) is an even function (product of odd functions), so we can simplify the integral by considering only the positive half and doubling it:\n\nb\u2099 = (2/\u03c0) \u222b_{0}^{\u03c0} x sin(nx) dx\n\nNow, we need to compute this integral. We'll use integration by parts, where:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\n\nThen du = dx, v = (-1/n) cos(nx)\n\nUsing the formula for integration by parts: \u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\n\n\u222b x sin(nx) dx = (-x/n) cos(nx) - \u222b (-1/n) cos(nx) dx\n\n= (-x/n) cos(nx) + (1/n) \u222b cos(nx) dx\n\n= (-x/n) cos(nx) + (1/n\u00b2) sin(nx)\n\nNow, evaluate this from 0 to \u03c0:\n\n[(-\u03c0/n) cos(n\u03c0) + (1/n\u00b2) sin(n\u03c0)] - [(-0/n) cos(0) + (1/n\u00b2) sin(0)]\n\n= (-\u03c0/n) cos(n\u03c0) + (1/n\u00b2) sin(n\u03c0) - 0 - 0\n\n= (-\u03c0/n) cos(n\u03c0) + 0 (since sin(n\u03c0) = 0 for all integer n)\n\nTherefore,\n\nb\u2099 = (2/\u03c0) * [(-\u03c0/n) cos(n\u03c0)]\n\n= (2/\u03c0) * (-\u03c0/n) cos(n\u03c0)\n\n= -2/n cos(n\u03c0)\n\nNow, recall that cos(n\u03c0) = (-1)^n\n\nSo,\n\nb\u2099 = -2/n * (-1)^n = (2/n)(-1)^{n+1}\n\nTherefore, the Fourier coefficients are:\n\na\u2080 = 0\n\na\u2099 = 0 for all n\n\nb\u2099 = (2/n)(-1)^{n+1}\n\n**Final Fourier Series Representation:**\n\nf(x) = \u03a3 [(2/n)(-1)^{n+1} sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x on the interval [-\u03c0, \u03c0].\n\n**Note:** This series converges to f(x) = x at all points where f is continuous, which in this case is everywhere on (-\u03c0, \u03c0). At the endpoints x = -\u03c0 and x = \u03c0, the series converges to the average value of the function at those points, which is zero since f(-\u03c0) = -\u03c0 and f(\u03c0) = \u03c0, and their average is zero. However, in practice, the Fourier series for f(x) = x is often considered on the open interval (-\u03c0, \u03c0)."
