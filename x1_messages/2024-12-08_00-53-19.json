        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to understand what the factory is currently doing and then see how changes affect its output.\n\nSo, the factory currently produces 500 units of product A in 8 hours. That means its current production rate is 500 units per 8 hours. To make things easier, maybe we should find out how many units it produces per hour.\n\nTo find the hourly production rate, we can divide the total units by the total hours:\n\n500 units / 8 hours = 62.5 units per hour.\n\nAlright, so the factory produces 62.5 units each hour.\n\nNow, the factory is planning to increase its production rate by 25%. So, we need to calculate what 25% of the current production rate is and then add that to the current rate.\n\nFirst, let's find 25% of 62.5 units per hour:\n\n25% of 62.5 = 0.25 * 62.5 = 15.625 units per hour.\n\nSo, the increase in production rate is 15.625 units per hour.\n\nNow, add that to the current production rate to find the new production rate:\n\n62.5 + 15.625 = 78.125 units per hour.\n\nAlright, so the new production rate is 78.125 units per hour.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many units the factory will produce in 10 hours at this new production rate.\n\nTo do that, we simply multiply the new production rate by the number of hours:\n\n78.125 units/hour * 10 hours = 781.25 units.\n\nWait a minute, but we're dealing with units of product, which are typically whole numbers. So, should we round this to the nearest whole number?\n\n781.25 rounds to 781 units, since you can't really produce a fraction of a unit.\n\nBut let's double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, current production: 500 units in 8 hours.\n\nProduction rate: 500 / 8 = 62.5 units per hour.\n\nIncrease by 25%: 0.25 * 62.5 = 15.625 units per hour.\n\nNew production rate: 62.5 + 15.625 = 78.125 units per hour.\n\nProduction in 10 hours: 78.125 * 10 = 781.25 units.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about the overall increase in production. A 25% increase means the factory is now producing 125% of its original rate.\n\nSo, we could calculate 125% of the original production over the same time period and then adjust for the new time period.\n\nWait, that might be a bit confusing. Let's try another approach to verify.\n\nIf the factory originally produces 500 units in 8 hours, and it increases its production rate by 25%, that means for each hour, it will produce 25% more than before.\n\nSo, in 8 hours at the new rate, it would produce 500 * 1.25 = 625 units.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because that would be applying the percentage increase to the total output instead of the hourly rate.\n\nNo, actually, increasing the production rate by 25% means that each hour, it produces 25% more units than before, not that in the same time it produces 25% more units.\n\nWait, no, actually, increasing the production rate by 25% means that the rate per hour increases by 25%.\n\nSo, the new rate is 125% of the original rate.\n\nSo, in 8 hours at the new rate, it would produce 500 * (125/100) = 500 * 1.25 = 625 units.\n\nBut we're not interested in 8 hours; we're interested in 10 hours.\n\nSo, if in 8 hours at the new rate it produces 625 units, then in 10 hours, it would produce more.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the new hourly rate and then multiply by 10 hours, which is what we did earlier.\n\nOriginal rate: 500 units / 8 hours = 62.5 units/hour.\n\nNew rate: 62.5 * 1.25 = 78.125 units/hour.\n\nIn 10 hours: 78.125 * 10 = 781.25 units.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we could set up a proportion.\n\nIf in 8 hours, the factory produces 500 units at the original rate, then at an increased rate of 125% , in 10 hours, it would produce X units.\n\nBut I think the first method is clearer.\n\nSo, finally, the factory will produce 781.25 units in 10 hours at the new production rate.\n\nSince partial units may not be possible, we might round this to 781 units.\n\nBut perhaps the context allows for fractional units, in which case 781.25 is acceptable.\n\nBut since it's a factory producing units of product, it's likely that only whole units are produced.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 781 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{781} \\]"
