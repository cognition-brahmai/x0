        "content": "So the restaurant serves 150 customers per day on average. Each customer orders a meal that costs $12 and a drink that costs $3. We need to find out the total revenue generated by the restaurant in one week.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total amount spent by each customer per day. Each customer orders a meal and a drink, so that's $12 for the meal plus $3 for the drink. So, $12 + $3 = $15 per customer.\n\nNow, since the restaurant serves 150 customers per day, the daily revenue would be 150 customers times $15 per customer. So, 150 \u00d7 $15 = $2,250 per day.\n\nNext, to find the weekly revenue, we need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so $2,250 per day times 7 days equals $15,750.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. 150 customers per day, each spending $15, that's $2,250 per day. Over 7 days, that would be $2,250 \u00d7 7.\n\nLet me do the math again: 2,250 multiplied by 7.\n\n2,250 \u00d7 7:\n\n2,000 \u00d7 7 = 14,000\n\n250 \u00d7 7 = 1,750\n\nAdding those together: 14,000 + 1,750 = 15,750.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total revenue generated by the restaurant in one week is $15,750.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation. For example, are there any discounts or additional charges that customers might incur? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think $15,750 is the accurate figure based on the information provided.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the restaurant operates seven days a week. If the restaurant is closed on certain days, then the weekly revenue would be lower. But since the problem states \"per day on average,\" I think it's safe to assume that it's open every day.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the average is 150 customers per day. Does that mean exactly 150 every day, or is it an average with some days higher and some lower? But since it's an average, using 150 per day for the calculation should give us the correct weekly average revenue.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total revenue generated by the restaurant in one week is $15,750.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15750} \\]"
