        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a factory that produces two types of products, C and D. Each product requires a certain amount of labor hours, and there's a limit to how many hours the factory can work per week. Also, each product brings in a different amount of profit per unit. The goal is to figure out how many units of each product the factory should produce to maximize its weekly profit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints and the objective. The constraints are mainly about the labor hours available. Product C requires 3 hours per unit, and product D requires 2 hours per unit. The factory has a maximum of 600 hours per week. So, the total labor hours used for producing both products cannot exceed 600 hours.\n\nThe objective is to maximize profit. Each unit of product C brings in $50, and each unit of product D brings in $30. So, the total profit will be 50 times the number of units of C plus 30 times the number of units of D.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let x be the number of units of product C produced per week.\n\n- Let y be the number of units of product D produced per week.\n\nGiven that, the labor hour constraint can be expressed as:\n\n3x + 2y \u2264 600\n\nAnd the profit function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 50x + 30y\n\nNow, since the factory can't produce negative units, we also have:\n\nx \u2265 0\n\ny \u2265 0\n\nSo, we're dealing with a linear programming problem here, where we need to maximize the profit function subject to the labor hour constraint and the non-negativity constraints.\n\nTo solve this, I can use the graphical method, which involves plotting the constraint on a graph and finding the feasible region. Then, the optimal solution will be at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, I'll plot the labor hour constraint:\n\n3x + 2y = 600\n\nI can find the intercepts to plot this line.\n\nWhen x = 0:\n\n3(0) + 2y = 600\n\n2y = 600\n\ny = 300\n\nSo, the y-intercept is at (0, 300).\n\nWhen y = 0:\n\n3x + 2(0) = 600\n\n3x = 600\n\nx = 200\n\nSo, the x-intercept is at (200, 0).\n\nPlotting these points and drawing the line, the feasible region for the labor hour constraint is below this line, including the axes, since x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0.\n\nNow, to find the optimal solution, I need to see where the profit function is maximized within this feasible region.\n\nThe profit function is:\n\nProfit = 50x + 30y\n\nTo maximize this, I can think about moving the profit line (50x + 30y = k, where k is a constant representing profit) across the feasible region and finding the point where it reaches the highest possible value of k before exiting the feasible region.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a linear problem, the optimal solution will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nSo, let's find the vertices of the feasible region.\n\n1. The origin: (0, 0)\n\n2. The x-intercept: (200, 0)\n\n3. The y-intercept: (0, 300)\n\n4. The intersection point of the labor constraint line with the axes.\n\nWait, actually, points 2 and 3 are already the intercepts. Is there another intersection point? In this case, since there's only one constraint besides the non-negativity constraints, the feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (200,0), (0,300), but in reality, since 3x + 2y \u2264 600, and x,y \u2265 0, it's a triangular feasible region with vertices at (0,0), (200,0), and (0,300).\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices and see which one gives the highest profit.\n\n1. At (0,0):\n\nProfit = 50(0) + 30(0) = $0\n\n2. At (200,0):\n\nProfit = 50(200) + 30(0) = $10,000\n\n3. At (0,300):\n\nProfit = 50(0) + 30(300) = $9,000\n\nSo, based on this, the maximum profit is $10,000, achieved by producing 200 units of product C and 0 units of product D.\n\nBut, let me double-check if there's a better combination inside the feasible region. Maybe producing some units of both products could lead to a higher profit.\n\nWait, in linear programming, for problems with only equality and inequality constraints, and linear objective functions, the optimal solution always occurs at one of the vertices of the feasible region. So, according to that theory, I don't need to look inside the feasible region; I just need to compare the vertex points.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any point within the feasible region that might give a higher profit.\n\nSuppose the factory produces some units of both products. For example, let's say x = 100 and y = 150.\n\nCheck if this point satisfies the constraint:\n\n3(100) + 2(150) = 300 + 300 = 600, which is equal to the maximum labor hours available.\n\nNow, calculate the profit:\n\n50(100) + 30(150) = 5,000 + 4,500 = $9,500\n\nThis is less than $10,000, which was the profit at (200,0).\n\nLet's try another point, say x = 150 and y = 100.\n\nCheck the constraint:\n\n3(150) + 2(100) = 450 + 200 = 650, which exceeds the 600-hour limit. So, this point is not feasible.\n\nHow about x = 100 and y = 100?\n\n3(100) + 2(100) = 300 + 200 = 500, which is within the limit.\n\nProfit = 50(100) + 30(100) = 5,000 + 3,000 = $8,000\n\nStill less than $10,000.\n\nAnother point, x = 150 and y = 75.\n\nCheck constraint:\n\n3(150) + 2(75) = 450 + 150 = 600, which is equal to the limit.\n\nProfit = 50(150) + 30(75) = 7,500 + 2,250 = $9,750\n\nStill less than $10,000.\n\nIt seems that producing only product C maximizes the profit in this scenario.\n\nBut, let's consider if there are any other constraints that I might have missed. The problem only mentions the labor hour constraint, so perhaps that's all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are constraints on the demand for each product, but since they're not specified, I'll assume that the factory can sell all it produces.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are constraints on the production capacity for each product, but again, since they're not mentioned, I'll proceed with the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the linear programming approach, producing 200 units of product C and 0 units of product D will maximize the profit at $10,000 per week.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider the profit per labor hour for each product.\n\nFor product C:\n\nProfit per unit: $50\n\nLabor per unit: 3 hours\n\nSo, profit per labor hour: 50 / 3 \u2248 $16.67 per hour\n\nFor product D:\n\nProfit per unit: $30\n\nLabor per unit: 2 hours\n\nProfit per labor hour: 30 / 2 = $15 per hour\n\nComparing these, product C generates more profit per labor hour than product D ($16.67 vs. $15). Therefore, it makes sense to prioritize producing product C to maximize profit.\n\nHence, the factory should produce only product C, specifically 200 units per week, to achieve the maximum profit of $10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200 \\text{ units of product C and } 0 \\text{ units of product D}} \\]"
