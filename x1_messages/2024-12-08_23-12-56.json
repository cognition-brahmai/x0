        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Let's look at each cooking style and see which method of heat transfer is primarily at work.\n\n1. **Grilling**: Grilling involves placing food directly over a heat source, usually open flames or hot coals. The primary method of heat transfer here is **radiation**. Radiation is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves, so the heat from the flames or coals travels directly to the food without needing a medium like air or water.\n\n2. **Boiling**: When you boil food, you're submerging it in a liquid (usually water) that's been heated to its boiling point. The primary method of heat transfer in boiling is **convection**. Convection occurs because the heated liquid becomes less dense and rises, while the cooler liquid sinks, creating a circulation current that transfers heat to the food.\n\n3. **Frying**: Frying involves cooking food in oil or another fat, typically at high temperatures. The primary method of heat transfer in frying is also **convection**, similar to boiling. The hot oil circulates around the food, transferring heat through the movement of the oil.\n\n4. **Baking**: Baking is done in an oven where hot air surrounds the food. The primary method of heat transfer in baking is **convection**. The oven heats the air, and this hot air then transfers heat to the food by circulating around it.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Grilling: Radiation\n\n- Boiling: Convection\n\n- Frying: Convection\n\n- Baking: Convection\n\nI hope that helps clarify the different methods of heat transfer in these cooking styles! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
