        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got an airline that wants to start a new route between two cities that are 1,500 miles apart. They're looking at two different aircraft, Aircraft A and Aircraft B, and they want to know which one is more fuel-efficient for this route. They're planning to operate four round trips per day with each aircraft, and they've given us some details about seating capacity and fuel consumption.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what fuel consumption means in this context. It seems like Aircraft A consumes 0.06 gallons of fuel per passenger-mile, and Aircraft B consumes 0.05 gallons per passenger-mile. A passenger-mile is a unit that represents one passenger traveling one mile. So, the fuel consumption rate tells us how much fuel is used to transport one passenger for one mile.\n\nNow, since it's a round trip, that means the aircraft will fly from City A to City B and back to City A, covering a total distance of 1,500 miles each way, so 3,000 miles per round trip.\n\nThe airline is operating four round trips per day with each aircraft. So, per day, each aircraft will fly 4 times 3,000 miles, which is 12,000 miles per day.\n\nBut, fuel consumption isn't just based on the distance; it's also based on the number of passengers aboard. So, we need to consider how many passengers each aircraft is carrying per trip.\n\nAircraft A has a seating capacity of 180 passengers, and Aircraft B has a seating capacity of 220 passengers. Assuming the aircraft are always fully booked, which might be a reasonable assumption for calculating fuel efficiency, we can proceed with these numbers.\n\nLet's first calculate the total passenger-miles per day for each aircraft.\n\nFor Aircraft A:\n\nPassenger-miles per round trip = number of passengers \u00d7 distance per round trip = 180 passengers \u00d7 3,000 miles = 540,000 passenger-miles per round trip.\n\nSince there are four round trips per day, total passenger-miles per day for Aircraft A = 540,000 \u00d7 4 = 2,160,000 passenger-miles per day.\n\nSimilarly, for Aircraft B:\n\nPassenger-miles per round trip = 220 passengers \u00d7 3,000 miles = 660,000 passenger-miles per round trip.\n\nTotal passenger-miles per day for Aircraft B = 660,000 \u00d7 4 = 2,640,000 passenger-miles per day.\n\nNow, fuel consumption is given in gallons per passenger-mile. So, to find the total fuel consumption per day, we can multiply the total passenger-miles per day by the fuel consumption rate per passenger-mile.\n\nFor Aircraft A:\n\nFuel consumption per day = 2,160,000 passenger-miles/day \u00d7 0.06 gallons/passenger-mile.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check the units here. If fuel consumption is 0.06 gallons per passenger-mile, then for each passenger-mile, 0.06 gallons are consumed. So, for 2,160,000 passenger-miles, the total fuel consumption would indeed be 2,160,000 \u00d7 0.06 gallons.\n\nBut, let's make sure that this is the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe fuel consumption is better expressed in gallons per mile or per flight, but given the information provided, this seems to be the approach we have to take.\n\nSo, proceeding with this method:\n\nAircraft A: 2,160,000 passenger-miles/day \u00d7 0.06 gallons/passenger-mile = 129,600 gallons/day.\n\nAircraft B: 2,640,000 passenger-miles/day \u00d7 0.05 gallons/passenger-mile = 132,000 gallons/day.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive. Aircraft B has a lower fuel consumption rate per passenger-mile (0.05 vs. 0.06), but because it carries more passengers, the total fuel consumption per day is higher for Aircraft B (132,000 gallons/day vs. 129,600 gallons/day for Aircraft A).\n\nBut, is the question asking for which aircraft is more fuel-efficient? Fuel efficiency could be interpreted in different ways. If we look at fuel consumption per passenger-mile, then Aircraft B is more efficient because it consumes less fuel per passenger-mile compared to Aircraft A.\n\nHowever, if we look at total fuel consumption per day, Aircraft A uses less fuel per day than Aircraft B, but that's only because it carries fewer passengers. So, total fuel consumption might not be the best metric for efficiency in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should look at fuel consumption per passenger per trip or per mile.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps a better way to assess fuel efficiency is to look at how much fuel is consumed per passenger transported over the entire route.\n\nSo, for a round trip, the fuel consumption would be the fuel consumption rate per passenger-mile multiplied by the number of passengers and the distance of the round trip.\n\nBut, hold on, that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should consider the fuel consumption per available seat-mile or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the fuel consumption per passenger carried per day and see which aircraft is more efficient in that regard.\n\nBut, let's consider the purpose of the airline. They want to transport passengers from City A to City B and back, and they're operating multiple round trips per day. They need to choose between Aircraft A and B based on which one is more fuel-efficient for this route.\n\nIf we look at fuel consumption per passenger-mile, Aircraft B is more efficient because it consumes less fuel per passenger-mile. However, since it carries more passengers, the total fuel consumption is higher, but that's because it's transporting more people.\n\nSo, maybe the better way is to look at fuel consumption per passenger per day.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, how many passengers are transported per day by each aircraft.\n\nAircraft A: 180 passengers per round trip \u00d7 4 round trips per day = 720 passengers per day.\n\nAircraft B: 220 passengers per round trip \u00d7 4 round trips per day = 880 passengers per day.\n\nNow, total fuel consumption per day:\n\nAircraft A: 129,600 gallons per day.\n\nAircraft B: 132,000 gallons per day.\n\nSo, fuel consumption per passenger per day:\n\nAircraft A: 129,600 gallons / 720 passengers = 180 gallons per passenger per day.\n\nAircraft B: 132,000 gallons / 880 passengers = 150 gallons per passenger per day.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Aircraft B is carrying more passengers, but its total fuel consumption is only slightly higher than Aircraft A's, leading to lower fuel consumption per passenger.\n\nBut, hold on, the initial calculation showed that Aircraft A consumes less total fuel per day than Aircraft B, but transports fewer passengers. So, on a per passenger basis, Aircraft B is more efficient.\n\nHowever, this seems contradictory to the initial fuel consumption rates provided. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, total passenger-miles per day:\n\nAircraft A: 180 passengers \u00d7 3,000 miles \u00d7 4 trips = 2,160,000 passenger-miles per day.\n\nAircraft B: 220 passengers \u00d7 3,000 miles \u00d7 4 trips = 2,640,000 passenger-miles per day.\n\nFuel consumption per day:\n\nAircraft A: 2,160,000 passenger-miles \u00d7 0.06 gallons/passenger-mile = 129,600 gallons per day.\n\nAircraft B: 2,640,000 passenger-miles \u00d7 0.05 gallons/passenger-mile = 132,000 gallons per day.\n\nNow, passengers per day:\n\nAircraft A: 180 passengers \u00d7 4 trips = 720 passengers per day.\n\nAircraft B: 220 passengers \u00d7 4 trips = 880 passengers per day.\n\nFuel consumption per passenger per day:\n\nAircraft A: 129,600 gallons / 720 passengers = 180 gallons per passenger per day.\n\nAircraft B: 132,000 gallons / 880 passengers = 150 gallons per passenger per day.\n\nWait, this suggests that Aircraft B is more fuel-efficient on a per passenger basis, which aligns with its lower fuel consumption rate per passenger-mile.\n\nBut, intuitively, it seems odd that Aircraft B, which carries more passengers, would be more fuel-efficient per passenger than Aircraft A, especially if it's consuming only slightly more fuel in total while carrying many more passengers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Maybe fuel consumption shouldn't be calculated based on passenger-miles in this way.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe fuel consumption is better measured in gallons per mile per aircraft, regardless of the number of passengers.\n\nWait, but that doesn't account for the capacity of the aircraft. A larger aircraft might consume more fuel overall, but if it carries more passengers, it could be more efficient on a per passenger basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps fuel consumption is better expressed in gallons per available seat-mile.\n\nAvailable seat-miles is a measure of an airline's capacity, calculated by multiplying the number of seats available on a flight by the distance of the flight.\n\nSo, for Aircraft A:\n\nAvailable seat-miles per round trip = 180 seats \u00d7 3,000 miles = 540,000 seat-miles per round trip.\n\nTotal available seat-miles per day = 540,000 \u00d7 4 = 2,160,000 seat-miles per day.\n\nSimilarly, for Aircraft B:\n\nAvailable seat-miles per round trip = 220 seats \u00d7 3,000 miles = 660,000 seat-miles per round trip.\n\nTotal available seat-miles per day = 660,000 \u00d7 4 = 2,640,000 seat-miles per day.\n\nNow, fuel consumption per available seat-mile:\n\nAircraft A: 129,600 gallons per day / 2,160,000 seat-miles per day = 0.06 gallons per seat-mile.\n\nAircraft B: 132,000 gallons per day / 2,640,000 seat-miles per day = 0.05 gallons per seat-mile.\n\nWait, but this is the same as the given fuel consumption rate per passenger-mile, which makes sense because seat-miles are analogous to passenger-miles assuming seats are filled.\n\nSo, in this case, Aircraft B is more fuel-efficient on a per seat-mile basis.\n\nBut, perhaps a better measure for fuel efficiency in this context is fuel consumption per revenue passenger kilometer (RPK) or something similar, which is a common metric in aviation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should consider the load factor, which is the percentage of seats filled. However, in this problem, we're assuming full capacity for both aircraft.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and Aircraft B is more fuel-efficient on a per passenger basis.\n\nBut, to make sure, let's consider the fuel consumption per passenger for the entire round trip.\n\nFor Aircraft A:\n\nTotal fuel consumption per round trip = 540,000 passenger-miles \u00d7 0.06 gallons/passenger-mile = 32,400 gallons per round trip.\n\nFuel consumption per passenger per round trip = 32,400 gallons / 180 passengers = 180 gallons per passenger per round trip.\n\nSimilarly, for Aircraft B:\n\nTotal fuel consumption per round trip = 660,000 passenger-miles \u00d7 0.05 gallons/passenger-mile = 33,000 gallons per round trip.\n\nFuel consumption per passenger per round trip = 33,000 gallons / 220 passengers = 150 gallons per passenger per round trip.\n\nAgain, this shows that Aircraft B is more fuel-efficient per passenger.\n\nBut, this seems counterintuitive because Aircraft B is larger and might consume more fuel overall, but since it carries more passengers, the per passenger fuel consumption is lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the units. Let's check the fuel consumption rate again.\n\nThe fuel consumption is given as gallons per passenger-mile. So, 0.06 gallons per passenger-mile for Aircraft A and 0.05 gallons per passenger-mile for Aircraft B.\n\nWait a second, those rates seem very high. Is it realistic to consume 0.06 gallons per passenger-mile? Let's do a quick reality check.\n\nAssuming a passenger weighs around 150 lbs, and considering the weight of the aircraft itself, the fuel consumption seems excessively high. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the units.\n\nPerhaps the fuel consumption is given in gallons per mile per aircraft, not per passenger-mile.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"Aircraft A has a seating capacity of 180 passengers and consumes 0.06 gallons of fuel per passenger-mile, while Aircraft B has a seating capacity of 220 passengers and consumes 0.05 gallons of fuel per passenger-mile.\"\n\nOkay, it clearly states \"per passenger-mile.\" So, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nHowever, perhaps in reality, fuel consumption isn't directly proportional to the number of passengers in that way. Maybe there's a fixed amount of fuel consumed per mile regardless of the number of passengers, plus an additional amount per passenger.\n\nBut, based on the information provided, I have to work with the given fuel consumption rates.\n\nGiven that, Aircraft B is more fuel-efficient on a per passenger basis, even though it consumes more fuel in total because it carries more passengers.\n\nSo, for the airline, if the goal is to minimize fuel consumption per passenger transported, Aircraft B is the better choice.\n\nHowever, if the airline is concerned about total fuel consumption, Aircraft A uses less fuel per day, but it also transports fewer passengers.\n\nBut, in terms of efficiency, which likely refers to fuel consumption per unit of service provided (i.e., per passenger-mile or per passenger), Aircraft B is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, Aircraft B would be the more fuel-efficient option for this route.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Aircraft B is more fuel-efficient for this route.}} \\]"
