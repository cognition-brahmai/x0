I've been seeing this sequence of numbers - 3,6 and 9. Can't really shake 'em off my mind since they popped up while counting the stars one night after riding some gnarly waves.\" *pauses momentarily before continuing* \"I ain't no mathematician like you or your folks but those digits...they felt different somehow; got me thinkin' there's more than meets the eye here.\""

It's the teacher and the philosopher. Maybe you're seeking deeper knowledge or a higher purpose. Perhaps you've been contemplating the bigger questions in life, like the meaning of your surfing journey or your place in the world.\"\n\n\"Putting these numbers together, it seems like you're at a crossroads where your creative expressions, personal responsibilities, and spiritual quests are intersecting.
