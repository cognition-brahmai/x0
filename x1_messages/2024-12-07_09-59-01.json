        "content": "Let's see here. So, there's this problem about two trains moving towards each other from different stations. Station A and Station B are 120 miles apart, with Station B being east of Station A. One train leaves Station A going east at 60 mph, and the other leaves Station B going west at 80 mph, both starting at the same time. I need to figure out when they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the scenario. So, Station A is somewhere, and Station B is 120 miles east of Station A. Train 1 starts at Station A and goes east at 60 mph. Train 2 starts at Station B and goes west at 80 mph. They're moving towards each other, so they'll meet at some point between the two stations.\n\nI need to find the time when they meet. Let's denote that time as \"t\" hours after they start.\n\nNow, in \"t\" hours, Train 1 will have traveled a distance of 60t miles (since distance = speed \u00d7 time).\n\nSimilarly, Train 2 will have traveled 80t miles in the same time.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the total distance they cover together should equal the initial distance between the stations, which is 120 miles.\n\nSo, the equation should be:\n\nDistance covered by Train 1 + Distance covered by Train 2 = 120 miles\n\nThat is:\n\n60t + 80t = 120\n\nNow, I can combine like terms:\n\n140t = 120\n\nThen, solve for \"t\":\n\nt = 120 / 140\n\nt = 12 / 14\n\nt = 6 / 7 hours\n\nNow, to make sense of 6/7 hours, I can convert it to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:\n\n(6/7) \u00d7 60 = (6 \u00d7 60) / 7 = 360 / 7 \u2248 51.4286 minutes\n\nSo, they will meet approximately 51.43 minutes after they start.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me think again. Train 1 is going east from Station A at 60 mph, and Train 2 is going west from Station B at 80 mph, which is 120 miles east of Station A.\n\nSo, Train 1 is moving towards Station B, and Train 2 is moving towards Station A. They're approaching each other.\n\nThe relative speed at which they're approaching each other is the sum of their speeds, since they're moving towards each other.\n\nSo, relative speed = 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph\n\nNow, the initial distance between them is 120 miles.\n\nTime taken to meet = distance / relative speed = 120 / 140 = 6/7 hours, which is approximately 51.43 minutes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of how much distance each train covers in \"t\" hours and set up the equation accordingly.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s say they meet after \"t\" hours.\n\nIn \"t\" hours, Train 1 has traveled 60t miles.\n\nIn \"t\" hours, Train 2 has traveled 80t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they've traveled should equal the initial distance between the stations.\n\nSo, 60t + 80t = 120\n\nWhich again gives me 140t = 120, so t = 120/140 = 6/7 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about their positions at time \"t\".\n\nLet\u2019s denote the position of Train 1 as x1(t), and the position of Train 2 as x2(t), with Station A as the origin.\n\nSo, Station A is at x=0, Station B is at x=120 miles.\n\nTrain 1 starts at x=0 and moves east at 60 mph, so x1(t) = 60t\n\nTrain 2 starts at x=120 and moves west at 80 mph, so x2(t) = 120 - 80t\n\nThey meet when x1(t) = x2(t)\n\nSo, 60t = 120 - 80t\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\n60t + 80t = 120\n\n140t = 120\n\nt = 120/140 = 6/7 hours\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of closing speed.\n\nThe closing speed is the rate at which the distance between the two trains is decreasing.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, closing speed = 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph\n\nInitial distance = 120 miles\n\nTime to meet = distance / closing speed = 120 / 140 = 6/7 hours\n\nSo, all these methods lead to the same answer.\n\nPerhaps I can also think about how much time it takes for each train to cover their respective portions of the distance.\n\nBut I think that might complicate things unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of relative velocity.\n\nFrom the perspective of Train 1, Train 2 is approaching at a speed of 80 mph + 60 mph = 140 mph\n\nSince Train 1 sees Train 2 coming towards it at 140 mph, and the distance is 120 miles, time to meet is 120 / 140 = 6/7 hours\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 6/7 hours, or approximately 51.43 minutes.\n\nBut perhaps the expected answer is in hours and minutes, so maybe I should convert 6/7 hours into hours and minutes.\n\n6/7 hours is approximately 0.8571 hours.\n\n0.8571 hours \u00d7 60 minutes per hour = 51.4286 minutes, which is about 51 minutes and 26 seconds.\n\nSo, they will meet approximately 51 minutes and 26 seconds after they start.\n\nBut maybe I should leave it as a fraction for exactness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in hours.\n\nIn that case, 6/7 hours is the exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it wants the time in hours and minutes.\n\nIn any case, the important thing is that they meet after 6/7 hours.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{6}{7} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
