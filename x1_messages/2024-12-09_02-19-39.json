        "content": "So the company starts with a revenue of $100,000 in its first year, and it increases by 10% each year. I need to find out the total revenue for the next three years combined. That means the second year, third year, and fourth year, right?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. If the first year is $100,000, then the second year, with a 10% increase, would be $100,000 plus 10% of $100,000. 10% of $100,000 is $10,000, so the second year would be $110,000.\n\nNow, for the third year, it increases by another 10% from the second year. So, 10% of $110,000 is $11,000, making the third year $121,000.\n\nSimilarly, for the fourth year, it's a 10% increase from the third year. 10% of $121,000 is $12,100, so the fourth year would be $133,100.\n\nNow, to find the total revenue for the next three years combined, that would be the sum of the second, third, and fourth years.\n\nSo, $110,000 + $121,000 + $133,100.\n\nLet me add those up: $110,000 plus $121,000 is $231,000, and then plus $133,100 is $364,100.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst year: $100,000.\n\nSecond year: $100,000 * 1.10 = $110,000.\n\nThird year: $110,000 * 1.10 = $121,000.\n\nFourth year: $121,000 * 1.10 = $133,100.\n\nTotal for next three years: $110,000 + $121,000 + $133,100 = $364,100.\n\nAlternatively, is there a formula I can use for this? It seems like a geometric series, where each term is multiplied by 1.10.\n\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, a = $110,000 (second year), r = 1.10, and n = 3.\n\nPlugging in the values: S = 110,000 * (1.10^3 - 1)/(1.10 - 1).\n\nFirst, calculate 1.10^3: 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 = 1.331.\n\nThen, 1.331 - 1 = 0.331.\n\nDenominator: 1.10 - 1 = 0.10.\n\nSo, S = 110,000 * (0.331)/0.10 = 110,000 * 3.31 = $364,100.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the total revenue for the next three years is $364,100.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. If the revenue increases by 10% annually, is there a simpler way to calculate the total increase over three years?\n\nI know that compound interest formula is A = P * (1 + r)^n, where P is the principal amount, r is the rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nBut in this case, since the revenue is increasing each year, and we need the total revenue over three years, not just the final amount, perhaps summing up each year's revenue is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula to calculate the sum of compound interest over multiple periods.\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nI find that the formula for the future value of an annuity with compound interest is FV = P * [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r.\n\nBut in this case, the payments are not equal each year because the revenue is increasing.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the revenue each year as a separate cash flow and sum them up.\n\nYear 1: $100,000 (given, but not included in the next three years).\n\nYear 2: $100,000 * 1.10 = $110,000.\n\nYear 3: $110,000 * 1.10 = $121,000.\n\nYear 4: $121,000 * 1.10 = $133,100.\n\nTotal for years 2, 3, and 4: $110,000 + $121,000 + $133,100 = $364,100.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the present value and compound it, but I think summing up each year's revenue is straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If the revenue grows at 10% annually, the revenue in year n is $100,000 * (1.10)^(n-1).\n\nSo, for year 2: 100,000 * 1.10^1 = $110,000.\n\nYear 3: 100,000 * 1.10^2 = $121,000.\n\nYear 4: 100,000 * 1.10^3 = $133,100.\n\nSumming these up again gives $364,100.\n\nI think that's consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's a formula to directly calculate the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence.\n\nYes, the sum S of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is S = a * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, a = $110,000, r = 1.10, n = 3.\n\nPlugging in: S = 110,000 * (1.10^3 - 1)/(1.10 - 1) = 110,000 * (1.331 - 1)/0.10 = 110,000 * 0.331/0.10 = 110,000 * 3.31 = $364,100.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the present value and use the formula for the present value of an annuity with growth, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nGiven that all methods lead to the same conclusion, I think $364,100 is the correct total revenue for the next three years.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me calculate the sum differently.\n\nLet's see, if I take the first year's revenue as $100,000, then the revenue for the next three years would be:\n\nYear 2: $100,000 * 1.10 = $110,000.\n\nYear 3: $100,000 * 1.10^2 = $121,000.\n\nYear 4: $100,000 * 1.10^3 = $133,100.\n\nAdding those up: $110,000 + $121,000 + $133,100 = $364,100.\n\nAlternatively, I can factor out $100,000 and sum the growth factors:\n\n$100,000 * (1.10 + 1.10^2 + 1.10^3) = $100,000 * (1.10 + 1.21 + 1.331) = $100,000 * 3.641 = $364,100.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it's clear that the total revenue for the next three years is $364,100.\n\nBut to be absolutely certain, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of \"next three years combined.\"\n\nIf the first year is already given as $100,000, then the next three years would be years 2, 3, and 4, which is what I've calculated.\n\nAlternatively, if \"next three years\" means years 1, 2, and 3, then it would be $100,000 (year 1) + $110,000 (year 2) + $121,000 (year 3) = $331,000.\n\nBut the question specifies \"the first year\" is $100,000, and \"the next three years combined,\" which should be years 2, 3, and 4.\n\nHowever, to avoid any confusion, perhaps I should clarify which years are being considered.\n\nGiven that the first year is year 1, then the next three years are years 2, 3, and 4.\n\nSo, revenues are:\n\nYear 1: $100,000.\n\nYear 2: $110,000.\n\nYear 3: $121,000.\n\nYear 4: $133,100.\n\nTotal for years 2, 3, and 4: $110,000 + $121,000 + $133,100 = $364,100.\n\nAlternatively, if \"the first year\" refers to year 0 or a baseline, but typically, first year would be year 1.\n\nI think the safest assumption is that first year is year 1, and next three years are years 2, 3, and 4.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue for the next three years is $364,100.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach using the concept of geometric series.\n\nThe revenues are growing at a constant rate, so they form a geometric sequence.\n\nThe sum S of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is S = a * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, the first term a is the revenue of the second year, which is $110,000, the common ratio r is 1.10, and n is 3.\n\nPlugging in: S = 110,000 * (1.10^3 - 1)/(1.10 - 1) = 110,000 * (1.331 - 1)/0.10 = 110,000 * 0.331/0.10 = 110,000 * 3.31 = $364,100.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's clear now that the total revenue for the next three years is $364,100.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any ambiguity in the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $364,100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{364100} \\]"
