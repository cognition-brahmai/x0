        "content": "So Mike can paint a house in 5 days, and his brother Steve can do it in 4 days. If they work together, how long will it take them to paint the house? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for them to work together. I think it means their painting speeds add up, right? So, I need to find out how much each of them paints per day and then add those amounts together to find out how much they can paint per day when working together.\n\nOkay, so Mike can paint a house in 5 days. That means he paints 1/5 of the house each day. Similarly, Steve can paint a house in 4 days, so he paints 1/4 of the house each day.\n\nNow, if they work together, their combined painting per day would be 1/5 plus 1/4. Let's calculate that:\n\n1/5 + 1/4 = (4 + 5)/20 = 9/20\n\nSo, together, they can paint 9/20 of the house each day.\n\nNow, to find out how many days it will take them to paint the entire house, I need to divide the whole house (which is 1) by their combined daily painting rate (which is 9/20).\n\nSo, time = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 days.\n\n20/9 days is approximately 2.222... days. But I should keep it as a fraction for exactness.\n\nSo, it will take them 20/9 days to paint the house together.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's check.\n\nIf Mike can do it in 5 days and Steve in 4, working together should be faster than either of them alone. Since Steve is faster individually, working together should be faster than 4 days but slower than if Steve worked alone.\n\n20/9 days is about 2.22 days, which is indeed faster than Steve's 4 days alone, so that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the combined work rate. Work rate is usually measured in parts of the job per unit of time.\n\nMike's work rate is 1/5 house per day, and Steve's is 1/4 house per day. Together, their work rate is 1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20 house per day.\n\nTo find the total time, we take the reciprocal of the combined work rate, which is 20/9 days.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of using the formula:\n\nTime = (individual times) / (sum of individual rates)\n\nWait, in this case, it's not exactly that. Let me recall.\n\nActually, a general formula for two people working together is:\n\nTime = (a * b) / (a + b)\n\nWhere a and b are the individual times.\n\nSo, in this case, a = 5 days, b = 4 days.\n\nPlugging into the formula: Time = (5 * 4) / (5 + 4) = 20 / 9 days.\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, yes, it should be 20/9 days.\n\nBut let's double-check by thinking about it differently.\n\nSuppose they work together for x days to complete the house.\n\nIn x days, Mike would paint (1/5)*x of the house, and Steve would paint (1/4)*x of the house.\n\nTogether, they should paint the whole house, so:\n\n(1/5)x + (1/4)x = 1\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx*(1/5 + 1/4) = 1\n\nWe already know 1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20, so:\n\nx*(9/20) = 1\n\nTherefore, x = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 days.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about how much they paint together each day.\n\nEach day, Mike paints 1/5 and Steve paints 1/4.\n\nSo together, they paint 1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20 per day.\n\nSo, to paint the whole house, which is 1, divided by their daily painting rate of 9/20, gives 20/9 days.\n\nEverything points to 20/9 days.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find a common denominator for their rates.\n\n5 and 4 have a least common multiple of 20.\n\nSo, in 20 days, Mike would paint 20/5 = 4 houses, and Steve would paint 20/4 = 5 houses.\n\nTogether, in 20 days, they would paint 4 + 5 = 9 houses.\n\nTherefore, to paint one house, they need 20/9 days.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's confirmed. It will take them 20/9 days to paint the house together.\n\nTo make it more understandable, 20/9 days is approximately 2 days and 2/9 of a day.\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, 2/9 of a day is (2/9)*24 = 48/9 = 5.333... hours.\n\nSo, approximately 2 days and 5 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nBut since the exact answer is 20/9 days, I'll stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, you can express it as a decimal: approximately 2.222... days.\n\nBut fractions are more precise, so 20/9 days is the best answer.\n\nSo, working together, Mike and Steve can paint the house in 20/9 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{20}{9}\\text{ days}} \\]"
