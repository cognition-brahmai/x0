        "content": "So there's this problem about two trains leaving different stations and moving towards each other. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nOkay, so train one leaves Station A going east at 60 mph, and train two leaves Station B going west towards Station A at 80 mph. The distance between Station A and Station B is 420 miles. I need to find out how long it takes for these two trains to meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the relative speed is 60 mph plus 80 mph, which is 140 mph. That makes sense because they are closing the distance between them at that combined speed.\n\nNow, the total distance they need to cover before they meet is 420 miles. So, if they're approaching each other at 140 mph, I can find the time by dividing the distance by the relative speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nLet me write that down: time = 420 miles / 140 mph.\n\nLet's do the math: 420 divided by 140 is 3. So, it should take 3 hours for the trains to meet.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIn 3 hours, train one traveling at 60 mph would cover 180 miles (since 60 times 3 is 180). Train two traveling at 80 mph would cover 240 miles (80 times 3 is 240). Together, they would have covered 180 plus 240, which is 420 miles. That matches the distance between the stations.\n\nSo, yes, it takes 3 hours for the trains to meet.\n\nI think that's the correct answer."
