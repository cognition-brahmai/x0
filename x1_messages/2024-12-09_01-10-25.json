        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of memberships: Basic and Premium. The Basic membership costs $30 per month, and the Premium membership costs $50 per month plus a one-time fee of $100. We need to find out after how many months the total cost of both memberships will be the same.\n\nFirst, let's define what we're trying to find. We're looking for the number of months, which we'll call \"m,\" where the total cost of the Basic membership equals the total cost of the Premium membership.\n\nSo, the total cost for the Basic membership after m months would be:\n\nTotal Basic = 30 * m\n\nFor the Premium membership, there's a one-time fee of $100 plus $50 per month, so:\n\nTotal Premium = 100 + 50 * m\n\nWe need to find the value of m where Total Basic equals Total Premium:\n\n30m = 100 + 50m\n\nNow, to solve for m, we can rearrange the equation. Let's subtract 30m from both sides:\n\n30m - 30m = 100 + 50m - 30m\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0 = 100 + 20m\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. If we subtract 30m from both sides, the left side becomes zero, which isn't helpful. Maybe I should move all terms to one side.\n\nLet's try again:\n\n30m = 100 + 50m\n\nSubtract 50m from both sides:\n\n30m - 50m = 100\n\n-20m = 100\n\nNow, divide both sides by -20:\n\nm = 100 / -20\n\nm = -5\n\nHmm, a negative number of months doesn't make sense in this context. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me double-check the costs.\n\nBasic: 30 per month\n\nPremium: 100 one-time fee plus 50 per month\n\nSo, for m months:\n\nTotal Basic: 30m\n\nTotal Premium: 100 + 50m\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n30m = 100 + 50m\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the Premium has a higher monthly fee, so it's unlikely that the total costs would ever be equal unless somehow the Basic catches up, but with higher monthly costs for Premium, it's confusing to get a negative value.\n\nMaybe I should think about it differently. Maybe there's no point where they are equal, or perhaps I did something wrong in the calculation.\n\nLet me try plotting the costs.\n\nFor Basic:\n\nMonths (m): 0, Total: 0\n\n1: 30\n\n2: 60\n\n3: 90\n\n4: 120\n\n5: 150\n\nFor Premium:\n\nMonths (m): 0, Total: 100 (just the one-time fee)\n\n1: 100 + 50 = 150\n\n2: 100 + 100 = 200\n\n3: 100 + 150 = 250\n\n4: 100 + 200 = 300\n\n5: 100 + 250 = 350\n\nWait a second, at m=1, Basic is 30, Premium is 150\n\nAt m=2, Basic is 60, Premium is 200\n\nAt m=3, Basic is 90, Premium is 250\n\nAt m=4, Basic is 120, Premium is 300\n\nAt m=5, Basic is 150, Premium is 350\n\nIt seems like the Premium membership is always more expensive than the Basic membership for any positive number of months. So, perhaps the only point where they are equal is at m=0, where Basic is $0 and Premium is $100, but that's not equal.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I got m=-5, which would correspond to 5 months before starting, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the conclusion is that the total costs never equal for any positive number of months. But that seems contradictory to the mathematical solution, which gave m=-5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the setup. Let me consider if the Premium membership's one-time fee is paid upfront, and then the monthly fee is added each month.\n\nSo, for m months, Premium total is 100 + 50m.\n\nBasic is just 30m.\n\nSetting them equal: 30m = 100 + 50m\n\nSubtract 30m from both sides: 0 = 100 + 20m\n\nThen, -100 = 20m\n\nSo, m = -100 / 20 = -5\n\nAgain, negative five months. This suggests that there is no point in the future where the total costs are equal.\n\nPerhaps the interpretation is that the Premium membership will always cost more than the Basic membership for any positive number of months due to the higher monthly fee and the one-time fee.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question intended for the Premium membership to have a lower monthly fee, but as per the given information, it's $50 per month plus $100 one-time fee, against $30 per month for Basic.\n\nWait, maybe the Premium membership offers more value, hence the higher cost.\n\nBut the question is simply about when the total costs are equal.\n\nGiven the math, it seems they never be equal for any positive number of months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and the Premium membership has a lower monthly fee.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again.\n\n\"A company offers two types of memberships: Basic and Premium. The Basic membership costs $30 per month, while the Premium membership costs $50 per month with an additional one-time fee of $100. After how many months will the total cost of both memberships be equal?\"\n\nSo, Basic: $30/month\n\nPremium: $50/month + $100 one-time fee\n\nIn this case, the Premium membership is more expensive both upfront and on a monthly basis.\n\nHence, the total cost of Premium will always be higher than Basic for any positive number of months.\n\nTherefore, there is no point where the total costs are equal.\n\nThe earlier calculation of m=-5 doesn't have practical meaning in this context, as negative months don't make sense.\n\nSo, the answer is that the total costs never equal for any positive number of months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The total costs never equal for any positive number of months.}} \\]"
