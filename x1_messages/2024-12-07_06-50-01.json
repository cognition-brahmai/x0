        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The company has a monthly budget of $120,000. They spend 40% on salaries, 25% on rent, and 10% on utilities. We need to find out how much money is left for other expenses.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate how much they spend on salaries. 40% of $120,000 is:\n\n0.40 * 120,000 = $48,000\n\nNext, the rent is 25% of $120,000:\n\n0.25 * 120,000 = $30,000\n\nThen, utilities are 10% of $120,000:\n\n0.10 * 120,000 = $12,000\n\nNow, I'll add up these expenses:\n\nSalaries: $48,000\nRent: $30,000\nUtilities: $12,000\nTotal: $48,000 + $30,000 + $12,000 = $90,000\n\nFinally, to find out how much is left for other expenses, I'll subtract the total expenses from the budget:\n\n$120,000 - $90,000 = $30,000\n\nSo, $30,000 is left for other expenses.\n\n**Alternative way:**\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the percentage of the budget left after spending on salaries, rent, and utilities.\n\nTotal percentage spent:\n\n40% (salaries) + 25% (rent) + 10% (utilities) = 75%\n\nTherefore, the percentage left for other expenses is:\n\n100% - 75% = 25%\n\nNow, 25% of $120,000 is:\n\n0.25 * 120,000 = $30,000\n\nWhich matches the previous result.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nTo verify, let's add up all the expenses including the remaining amount:\n\nSalaries: $48,000\nRent: $30,000\nUtilities: $12,000\nOther expenses: $30,000\nTotal: $48,000 + $30,000 + $12,000 + $30,000 = $120,000\n\nThis matches the original budget, confirming that the calculation is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe amount left for other expenses is $30,000.\n\n**Additional Insight:**\n\nIt's interesting to see how the percentages allocate the budget. Salaries take the largest chunk at 40%, followed by rent at 25%, utilities at 10%, and finally other expenses at 25%. This distribution shows that the company spends the majority of its budget on salaries and rent, with other expenses making up a significant portion as well.\n\n**Potential Follow-up Questions:**\n\n1. What if the budget increases or decreases? How would that affect the amounts allocated to each category?\n\n2. If the company decides to reduce utilities expenses to 5%, how much more would be available for other expenses?\n\n3. How does this budget compare to industry standards or similar companies?\n\n**Example Calculation for Follow-up Question 2:**\n\nIf utilities are reduced to 5% of the budget:\n\nUtilities: 5% of $120,000 = 0.05 * 120,000 = $6,000\n\nTotal expenses on salaries, rent, and utilities:\n\n$48,000 (salaries) + $30,000 (rent) + $6,000 (utilities) = $84,000\n\nRemaining for other expenses:\n\n$120,000 - $84,000 = $36,000\n\nSo, by reducing utilities from 10% to 5%, the company can allocate an additional $6,000 ($36,000 - $30,000) to other expenses.\n\n**Graphical Representation:**\n\nTo visualize the budget allocation, we can think of a pie chart where:\n\n- Salaries: 40%\n- Rent: 25%\n- Utilities: 10%\n- Other expenses: 25%\n\nThis visual representation helps in understanding the proportion of the budget allocated to each category.\n\n**Table Format:**\n\n| Category       | Percentage | Amount |\n|----------------|------------|--------|\n| Salaries       | 40%        | $48,000|\n| Rent           | 25%        | $30,000|\n| Utilities      | 10%        | $12,000|\n| Other expenses | 25%        | $30,000|\n| **Total**      | **100%**   | **$120,000** |\n\nThis table clearly shows the distribution of the budget across different categories.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe company has $30,000 left for other expenses after accounting for salaries, rent, and utilities in their $120,000 monthly budget.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30000} \\]"
