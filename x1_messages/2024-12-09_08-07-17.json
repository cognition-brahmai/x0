        "content": "Yes, \"pasture-raised\" generally means that the animals have access to outdoor pastures and are allowed to graze and roam freely, as opposed to being confined indoors in a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO). This method of raising animals is often considered more humane and sustainable, as it allows the animals to engage in their natural behaviors and reduces the environmental impact of their waste. However, it's important to note that the term \"pasture-raised\" is not regulated by the government, so it's essential to research and understand the specific practices of the farm or producer to ensure that their methods align with your values and preferences."
