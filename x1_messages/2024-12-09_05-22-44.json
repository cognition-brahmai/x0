        "content": "No, that's a common misconception. After the Third Punic War, Scipio Aemilianus did indeed destroy Carthage, but there is no historical evidence to suggest that he plowed over the city or sowed it with salt to prevent future growth. This myth likely originated from a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of Roman practices and has been perpetuated over time. The idea of sowing salt to render land infertile is more commonly associated with other historical contexts, such as the destruction of cities in the ancient Near East. In reality, the Romans sold many Carthaginians into slavery and razed the city, but there is no credible record of them using salt to curse the land."
