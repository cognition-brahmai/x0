        "content": "So the problem says that John scores twice as many points as Mary, and Mary scored 15 points. I need to find out how many points John scored.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"twice as many\" means. If someone has twice as many of something, it means they have two times the amount that someone else has. So, in this case, John's points are two times Mary's points.\n\nMary scored 15 points. So, to find John's points, I need to multiply Mary's points by 2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nJohn's points = 2 \u00d7 Mary's points\n\nNow, plug in Mary's points:\n\nJohn's points = 2 \u00d7 15\n\nNow, I just need to do the multiplication.\n\n2 times 15 is 30.\n\nSo, John scored 30 points.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to make sure I'm correct?\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of ratios. If John scored twice as many points as Mary, the ratio of John's points to Mary's points is 2:1.\n\nSo, for every point Mary scores, John scores 2 points.\n\nSince Mary scored 15 points, John should have 2 points for each of Mary's points.\n\nSo, 15 points \u00d7 2 = 30 points.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s let M represent Mary's points and J represent John's points.\n\nGiven that J = 2M\n\nAnd M = 15\n\nSo, J = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nPerhaps I can think about the difference in their scores.\n\nIf John scored twice as many points as Mary, then the difference between John's and Mary's points is equal to Mary's points.\n\nSo, John's points - Mary's points = Mary's points\n\nJ - M = M\n\nGiven that M = 15,\n\nJ - 15 = 15\n\nNow, solve for J by adding 15 to both sides:\n\nJ = 15 + 15 = 30\n\nOnce again, I get 30 points for John.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. John scored 30 points.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if 30 is indeed twice as many as 15.\n\nHalf of 30 is 15, which matches Mary's points.\n\nSo, yes, 30 is twice as many as 15.\n\nI'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
