        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the pharmaceutical company is planning to build a new research facility to accommodate its growing workforce. Currently, they have 1,000 researchers and expect to hire an additional 500 over the next five years. That means in total, they will have 1,000 plus 500, which is 1,500 researchers.\n\nEach researcher requires two types of space: lab space and office space. Specifically, each researcher needs 150 square feet of lab space and 50 square feet of office space. So, first, I need to calculate the total space required for all researchers for both lab and office spaces.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total lab space required. Since each researcher needs 150 square feet and there are 1,500 researchers, the total lab space would be:\n\nTotal lab space = 1,500 researchers * 150 sq ft/researcher\n\nSimilarly, the total office space required would be:\n\nTotal office space = 1,500 researchers * 50 sq ft/researcher\n\nAfter calculating these two, I'll add them together to get the total space required for researchers.\n\nBut, there are also common areas to consider, such as conference rooms, restrooms, and break rooms, which will occupy an additional 20% of the building's total area. This means that the common areas are 20% of the total building area, and the researcher spaces (lab and office) make up the remaining 80%.\n\nSo, if I let the total building area be X square feet, then:\n\n80% of X = total researcher space (lab + office)\n\n20% of X = common areas\n\nBut actually, I need to find X, given that the researcher space is 80% of X.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to first calculate the total researcher space and then determine the total building area including the common areas.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, calculate total lab space:\n\n1,500 researchers * 150 sq ft/researcher = 225,000 sq ft\n\nTotal office space:\n\n1,500 researchers * 50 sq ft/researcher = 75,000 sq ft\n\nTotal researcher space = 225,000 + 75,000 = 300,000 sq ft\n\nNow, this researcher space is 80% of the total building area, since common areas take up 20%.\n\nLet me denote the total building area as X.\n\nSo, 80% of X = 300,000 sq ft\n\nIn equation form:\n\n0.8X = 300,000\n\nTo find X, divide both sides by 0.8:\n\nX = 300,000 / 0.8 = 375,000 sq ft\n\nTherefore, the total square footage required for the new facility is 375,000 square feet.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total researchers: 1,000 current + 500 additional = 1,500 researchers\n\nLab space per researcher: 150 sq ft\n\nOffice space per researcher: 50 sq ft\n\nTotal lab space: 1,500 * 150 = 225,000 sq ft\n\nTotal office space: 1,500 * 50 = 75,000 sq ft\n\nTotal researcher space: 225,000 + 75,000 = 300,000 sq ft\n\nCommon areas are 20% of total building area, so researcher space is 80% of total area.\n\nSo, 0.8X = 300,000\n\nX = 300,000 / 0.8 = 375,000 sq ft\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total building area needing to be the researcher space plus the common areas, which are 20% of the total area.\n\nBut mathematically, it's the same as above.\n\nSo, the total square footage required for the new facility is 375,000 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375000} \\]\n"
