        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2 and then subtracting 3. It starts with 5. I need to find the 6th term.\n\nOkay, so let's write down the steps one by one.\n\nFirst term: 5\n\nTo get the second term, I multiply 5 by 2, which is 10, and then subtract 3, so 10 - 3 = 7.\n\nSecond term: 7\n\nNow, for the third term, I take 7, multiply by 2 to get 14, then subtract 3: 14 - 3 = 11.\n\nThird term: 11\n\nFourth term: 11 * 2 = 22, then 22 - 3 = 19.\n\nFourth term: 19\n\nFifth term: 19 * 2 = 38, then 38 - 3 = 35.\n\nFifth term: 35\n\nFinally, the sixth term: 35 * 2 = 70, then 70 - 3 = 67.\n\nSo, the sixth term is 67.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nFirst term: 5\n\nSecond term: 5 * 2 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n\nThird term: 7 * 2 - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11\n\nFourth term: 11 * 2 - 3 = 22 - 3 = 19\n\nFifth term: 19 * 2 - 3 = 38 - 3 = 35\n\nSixth term: 35 * 2 - 3 = 70 - 3 = 67\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula to find the nth term without calculating each one step by step. Let's try to find a general formula.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the nth term as a_n.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 5\n\nAnd a_{n+1} = 2*a_n - 3\n\nI think this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} - 2a_n = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 2 = 0, so r = 2.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*2^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is -3, which is a constant, I can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = B, where B is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence relation:\n\nB = 2*B - 3\n\nSolving for B: B - 2*B = -3 => -B = -3 => B = 3.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = A*2^n + 3.\n\nNow, use the initial condition to find A.\n\na_1 = 5 = A*2^1 + 3 => 2A + 3 = 5 => 2A = 2 => A = 1.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = 2^n + 3.\n\nLet\u2019s verify this with the earlier terms.\n\na_1 = 2^1 + 3 = 5 correct\n\na_2 = 2^2 + 3 = 7 correct\n\na_3 = 2^3 + 3 = 11 correct\n\na_4 = 2^4 + 3 = 19 correct\n\na_5 = 2^5 + 3 = 35 correct\n\na_6 = 2^6 + 3 = 64 + 3 = 67 correct\n\nGreat, so the formula a_n = 2^n + 3 gives the nth term of the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the 6th term is indeed 67.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{67} \\]"
