        "content": "Sure! Here's a simple implementation of a binary search algorithm in C++. This function takes a sorted array of integers and a target integer, then returns the index of the target if found, or -1 if not found.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint binarySearch(const int arr[], int size, int target) {\n    int left = 0;\n    int right = size - 1;\n    \n    while (left <= right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        \n        if (arr[mid] == target) {\n            return mid;\n        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\n            left = mid + 1;\n        } else {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return -1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15};\n    int size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);\n    int target = 7;\n    \n    int result = binarySearch(arr, size, target);\n    \n    if (result != -1) {\n        std::cout << \"Element found at index \" << result << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Element not found in the array\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **binarySearch Function**:\n   - Takes a sorted array `arr`, its size `size`, and the `target` integer to find.\n   - Initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n   - Enters a loop where it calculates the middle index `mid` and checks if the middle element is the target.\n   - If the middle element is less than the target, it adjusts the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.\n   - If the middle element is greater than the target, it adjusts the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.\n   - If the target is found, it returns the index `mid`.\n   - If the loop ends without finding the target, it returns -1.\n\n2. **main Function**:\n   - Defines a sorted array `arr` and calculates its size.\n   - Sets a `target` value to search for.\n   - Calls `binarySearch` with the array, size, and target.\n   - Prints the result based on whether the target was found or not.\n\nThis is a basic example, but binary search is a fundamental algorithm for searching in sorted arrays and is very efficient with a time complexity of O(log n)."
