Mahatma Gandhi was not assassinated by John Wilkes Booth in 1958. In fact, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist who opposed Gandhi's policies towards Pakistan and his advocacy for interreligious harmony. \n\nAs for Martin Luther King Jr., he was indeed a key figure in America's civil rights movement, but he was assassinated on April 4, 1968, by James Earl Ray. King was shot while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nI think there might be some mix-up in the dates and the individuals involved. Let me try to provide accurate information.\n\nFirst, regarding Mahatma Gandhi:\n\nMahatma Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, in New Delhi, India. The assassin was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist. Godse and his co-conspirators were disgruntled with Gandhi's leadership, particularly his initiatives to support Pakistan and his persistent calls for peace and unity between Hindus and Muslims during a time of widespread violence and partition.\n\nNow, about Martin Luther King Jr.:\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. The assassin was James Earl Ray, who was a fugitive at the time and later convicted for the crime. King was standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel when he was shot. His assassination was a result of his prominent role in the civil rights movement and his advocacy for racial equality and nonviolent protest.\n\nIt's important to have accurate historical facts to understand the contexts and impacts of these events properly.\n\nAs for the link you provided, it seems to be about Mahatma Gandhi, but the information you presented seems to be a mix-up of different historical events. The URL you mentioned is from Britannica, which is a reliable source for biographical and historical information.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Nathuram Godse assassinated Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, 1948, due to political and ideological differences.}} \\]"
