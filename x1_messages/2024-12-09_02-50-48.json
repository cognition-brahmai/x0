I know that a set is countably infinite if its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers, which is {1, 2, 3, ...} and so on.\n\nFirst, let's recall what even integers are. Even integers are integers that are divisible by 2, so they can be written in the form 2k, where k is an integer. So, the set of even integers is {..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...}.\n\nNow, to show that this set is countably infinite, I need to find a way to pair each even integer with a unique natural number, and vice versa. In other words, I need to find a bijection between the set of even integers and the set of natural numbers.\n\nLet me think about how to do this. One way is to define a function that maps each natural number to an even integer in a systematic way. For example, I could define a function f: \u2115 \u2192 2\u2124 (where 2\u2124 represents the set of even integers) by f(n) = 2n.\n\nLet's see what this function does:\n\n- f(1) = 2*1 = 2\n\n- f(2) = 2*2 = 4\n\n- f(3) = 2*3 = 6\n\n- and so on.\n\nThis seems to map each natural number to positive even integers, but it misses the negative even integers and zero. So, this isn't quite enough because the set of even integers includes negatives and zero as well.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach. Perhaps I can list all even integers in a sequence and assign each one a natural number index.\n\nLet's try listing the even integers in order, starting from zero:\n\n0, 2, -2, 4, -4, 6, -6, ...\n\nThis way, I'm including zero, then positive even integers, then their negatives, alternating.\n\nNow, I can assign natural numbers to each term in this sequence:\n\n1 \u2192 0\n\n2 \u2192 2\n\n3 \u2192 -2\n\n4 \u2192 4\n\n5 \u2192 -4\n\n6 \u2192 6\n\n7 \u2192 -6\n\n...\n\nThis seems to cover all even integers. Each even integer appears exactly once in this list, and each natural number corresponds to exactly one even integer.\n\nTo make this more formal, I can define a function f: \u2115 \u2192 2\u2124 where:\n\n- For n even, f(n) = (n/2)*2 = n\n\n- For n odd, f(n) = -( (n-1)/2 )*2\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLet me try plugging in some values:\n\n- n=1 (odd): f(1) = -((1-1)/2)*2 = -(0/2)*2 = 0\n\n- n=2 (even): f(2) = (2/2)*2 = 1*2 = 2\n\n- n=3 (odd): f(3) = -((3-1)/2)*2 = -(1)*2 = -2\n\n- n=4 (even): f(4) = (4/2)*2 = 2*2 = 4\n\n- n=5 (odd): f(5) = -((5-1)/2)*2 = -(2)*2 = -4\n\n- and so on.\n\nYes, this matches the sequence I listed earlier.\n\nSo, this function f seems to be a bijection between \u2115 and 2\u2124.\n\nTo confirm that it's a bijection, I need to show that it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).\n\nFirst, injectivity: Suppose f(a) = f(b). I need to show that a = b.\n\nConsider two cases:\n\n1. Both a and b are even.\n\nThen, f(a) = (a/2)*2 = a and f(b) = (b/2)*2 = b.\n\nSo, if f(a) = f(b), then a = b.\n\n2. Both a and b are odd.\n\nThen, f(a) = -((a-1)/2)*2 and f(b) = -((b-1)/2)*2.\n\nIf f(a) = f(b), then -((a-1)/2)*2 = -((b-1)/2)*2, which simplifies to (a-1)/2 = (b-1)/2, so a-1 = b-1, hence a = b.\n\n3. One is even and the other is odd.\n\nSuppose a is even and b is odd.\n\nThen, f(a) = a (positive even) and f(b) = -((b-1)/2)*2 (negative even).\n\nSince positive even numbers are not equal to negative even numbers, f(a) \u2260 f(b).\n\nSimilarly, if a is odd and b is even, f(a) is negative even and f(b) is positive even, so f(a) \u2260 f(b).\n\nTherefore, in all cases, f(a) = f(b) implies a = b, so f is injective.\n\nNow, surjectivity: For every even integer z \u2208 2\u2124, there exists a natural number n \u2208 \u2115 such that f(n) = z.\n\nLet z be any even integer. Then z = 2k for some integer k.\n\nWe need to find n \u2208 \u2115 such that f(n) = z.\n\nConsider two cases:\n\n1. z is non-negative (i.e., k \u2265 0).\n\nThen z = 2k, where k \u2265 0.\n\nLet n = z = 2k.\n\nSince z is non-negative even, n is a natural number (assuming 0 is included in natural numbers, but typically \u2115 starts from 1, so maybe not).\n\nWait, if z = 0, then n = 1, as per our earlier function.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust this.\n\nWait, in our function definition:\n\nFor n even, f(n) = n\n\nFor n odd, f(n) = -(n-1)\n\nWait, hold on, I think I need to redefine f more clearly.\n\nLet me try to define f more precisely.\n\nDefine f: \u2115 \u2192 2\u2124 by:\n\nf(n) = { 2*(m) if n = 2m (n even)\n\n-2*(m) if n = 2m+1 (n odd)\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier attempt:\n\nf(n) = { (n/2)*2 = n if n even\n\n-((n-1)/2)*2 = -(n-1) if n odd\n\nWait, but n is a natural number, starting from 1.\n\nSo, for n odd, say n=2m+1, then f(n) = -( (2m+1 -1)/2 )*2 = -(m)*2 = -2m\n\nAnd for n even, n=2m, f(n) = (2m)/2 * 2 = m*2 = 2m\n\nSo, f(n) = { 2m if n=2m (even)\n\n-2m if n=2m+1 (odd)\n\nSo, the function is f(n) = { 2*(n/2) if n even\n\n-2*((n-1)/2) if n odd }\n\nNow, let's verify surjectivity again.\n\nLet z be any even integer.\n\nCase 1: z is non-negative, z = 2k for some k \u2265 0.\n\nThen, set n = z = 2k. Since z is even, f(n) = 2*(n/2) = 2*(2k/2) = 2*k = z.\n\nCase 2: z is negative, z = -2k for some k > 0.\n\nThen, set n = 2k + 1 (which is odd).\n\nThen, f(n) = -2*((n-1)/2) = -2*((2k+1 -1)/2) = -2*(2k/2) = -2*k = z.\n\nSo, in both cases, there exists an n \u2208 \u2115 such that f(n) = z.\n\nTherefore, f is surjective.\n\nSince f is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection.\n\nHence, the set of even integers is countably infinite.\n\nAlternatively, another way to show that a set is countably infinite is to find a way to list its elements in a sequence such that every element appears exactly once.\n\nIn our earlier approach, we listed the even integers as: 0, 2, -2, 4, -4, 6, -6, ...\n\nThis is a sequence where each even integer appears exactly once, and the position in the sequence corresponds to a natural number.\n\nTherefore, this also demonstrates that the set of even integers is countably infinite.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the set of all even integers is countably infinite.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The set of all even integers is countably infinite.}} \\]"
