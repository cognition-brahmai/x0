        "content": "Let's see. So, originally, there are 8 employees, each working 40 hours per week. If the company hires 2 more employees, that makes the total number of employees 10. Then, they reduce everyone's work hours to 35 hours per week. I need to find out the total number of hours worked by all employees after these changes.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total number of hours worked before the changes to understand the difference, but since the question only asks for the total after the changes, maybe I don't need that.\n\nSo, after hiring 2 more employees, there are 10 employees in total. Each of them works 35 hours per week. To find the total hours worked by all employees, I just need to multiply the number of employees by the number of hours each one works.\n\nThat is, total hours = number of employees \u00d7 hours per employee.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, that's 10 \u00d7 35.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 10 times 35 is 350.\n\nSo, the total number of hours worked by all employees after the changes is 350 hours per week.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe compare it to the original total hours to see if there's a change or something.\n\nOriginally, with 8 employees at 40 hours each, the total was 8 \u00d7 40 = 320 hours per week.\n\nAfter the changes, it's 10 \u00d7 35 = 350 hours per week.\n\nSo, the total hours have increased by 30 hours per week.\n\nBut since the question only asks for the total number of hours after the changes, 350 hours is the answer.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{350} \\]"
