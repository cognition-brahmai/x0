        "content": "So I've got this problem about a garden with tomato plants, and I need to find out how many tomatoes the garden produces in total. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 5 rows of tomato plants. Each row has 6 plants. So, to find out the total number of plants in the garden, I think I need to multiply the number of rows by the number of plants per row. That should give me the total number of plants.\n\nSo, 5 rows times 6 plants per row: 5 times 6 is 30. So, there are 30 tomato plants in total.\n\nNext, each plant produces 10 tomatoes. So, to find out the total number of tomatoes, I need to multiply the total number of plants by the number of tomatoes each plant produces.\n\nThat means 30 plants times 10 tomatoes per plant: 30 times 10 is 300.\n\nSo, the garden produces 300 tomatoes in total.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps I can think about it in terms of rows and tomatoes per row.\n\nEach row has 6 plants, and each plant produces 10 tomatoes. So, tomatoes per row would be 6 plants times 10 tomatoes per plant, which is 60 tomatoes per row.\n\nThen, with 5 rows, the total number of tomatoes would be 5 rows times 60 tomatoes per row, which is also 300 tomatoes.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier. So, I think 300 is the correct total number of tomatoes produced by the garden.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other factor that could affect the total number of tomatoes? The problem doesn't mention any plants not producing tomatoes or any rows that are different from others. It seems straightforward.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- 5 rows\n\n- 6 plants per row\n\n- 10 tomatoes per plant\n\nTotal plants: 5 rows * 6 plants/row = 30 plants\n\nTotal tomatoes: 30 plants * 10 tomatoes/plant = 300 tomatoes\n\nAlternatively:\n\nTomatoes per row: 6 plants/row * 10 tomatoes/plant = 60 tomatoes/row\n\nTotal tomatoes: 5 rows * 60 tomatoes/row = 300 tomatoes\n\nBoth methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that 300 is the correct total number of tomatoes produced by the garden.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
