        "content": "Let's see here. The farmer has three types of seeds: corn, wheat, and soybean, and he plants them in a ratio of 4:7:9 respectively. The total number of seeds planted is 4000. I need to find out how many of each type he plants.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means in this context. A ratio tells us the proportional relationship between the quantities. So, for every 4 parts of corn, there are 7 parts of wheat and 9 parts of soybean.\n\nTo find out how many seeds of each type he plants, I need to determine the value of one part and then multiply it by the respective ratio numbers.\n\nLet me denote the common multiple of the parts as x. So, the number of corn seeds is 4x, wheat seeds is 7x, and soybean seeds is 9x.\n\nThe total number of seeds is the sum of these three:\n\n4x + 7x + 9x = 4000\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n20x = 4000\n\nNow, I'll solve for x:\n\nx = 4000 / 20\n\nx = 200\n\nNow that I have the value of x, I can find the number of each type of seed:\n\nCorn seeds: 4x = 4 * 200 = 800\n\nWheat seeds: 7x = 7 * 200 = 1400\n\nSoybean seeds: 9x = 9 * 200 = 1800\n\nLet me check if these add up to the total:\n\n800 + 1400 + 1800 = 4000\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the farmer plants 800 corn seeds, 1400 wheat seeds, and 1800 soybean seeds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800 \\text{ corn seeds}, 1400 \\text{ wheat seeds}, 1800 \\text{ soybean seeds}} \\]"
