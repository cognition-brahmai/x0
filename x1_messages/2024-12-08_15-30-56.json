        "content": "Let's see what this riddle is all about. It says, \"My first is in window but not in pane. My second's in road but not in lane. My third is in oval but not in round. My fourth is in hearing but not in sound. My whole is known as a sign of peace. And from Noah's ark won quick release.\"\n\nOkay, so it's a four-letter word, and each letter has specific clues related to other words. Let's break it down letter by letter.\n\nFirst letter: \"in window but not in pane.\" Hmm, window has letters W-O-N-D-O-W, and pane has P-A-N-E. So, the first letter is in window but not in pane. Looking at window, the letters are W, O, N, D. Pane has P, A, N, E. So, letters common to both are N. But since it's \"in window but not in pane,\" N is in both, so it can't be N. Wait, pane has P-A-N-E, window has W-O-N-D-O-W. So, letters in window not in pane are W, O, D. So, the first letter could be W, O, or D.\n\nSecond letter: \"in road but not in lane.\" Road is R-O-A-D, lane is L-A-N-E. Common letters are A. So, letters in road not in lane are R, O, D. So, the second letter could be R, O, or D.\n\nThird letter: \"in oval but not in round.\" Oval is O-V-A-L, round is R-O-U-N-D. Common letters are O and N. So, letters in oval not in round are V and L. So, the third letter could be V or L.\n\nFourth letter: \"in hearing but not in sound.\" Hearing is H-E-A-R-I-N-G, sound is S-O-U-N-D. Common letters are N and D. So, letters in hearing not in sound are H, E, A, R, I, G. So, the fourth letter could be H, E, A, R, I, or G.\n\nNow, the whole word is a sign of peace and is related to Noah's ark and quick release. So, perhaps it's something like a \"dove,\" which is a symbol of peace in the story of Noah's ark. But dove is a four-letter word: D-O-V-E.\n\nLet's check if it fits the clues.\n\nFirst letter: D. Is D in window but not in pane? Window has D, pane has N. So, D is in window not in pane. Yes.\n\nSecond letter: O. Is O in road but not in lane? Road has O, lane has A, N, E. So, O is in road not in lane. Yes.\n\nThird letter: V. Is V in oval but not in round? Oval has V, round has R, O, U, N, D. So, V is in oval not in round. Yes.\n\nFourth letter: E. Is E in hearing but not in sound? Hearing has E, sound has S, O, U, N, D. So, E is in hearing not in sound. Yes.\n\nAnd dove is a symbol of peace, especially from the story of Noah's ark. So, it seems to fit all the clues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{dove}} \\]"
