        "content": "So if a tree grows 2 rings per year, and it's cut down after it has grown 100 rings, how many years did the tree live? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of rings and the age of the tree. The problem says that the tree grows 2 rings per year. So, for each year that passes, the tree adds 2 rings to its total count.\n\nIf I let the number of years be Y, and the number of rings be R, then according to the problem, R = 2 * Y.\n\nWe're given that the tree is cut down after it has grown 100 rings, so R = 100.\n\nSo, plugging that into the equation: 100 = 2 * Y.\n\nNow, to find Y, I need to solve for Y by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.\n\nSo, Y = 100 / 2 = 50.\n\nTherefore, the tree lived for 50 years.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check this. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about how trees grow rings. I recall that typically, trees grow one ring per year, representing one growth cycle. But in this problem, it's specified that this particular tree grows 2 rings per year.\n\nSo, if it's growing 2 rings each year, then after 1 year, it would have 2 rings, after 2 years, 4 rings, and so on.\n\nSo, the pattern is:\n\nYears: 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., Y\n\nRings: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 2Y\n\nSo, when the tree has 100 rings, that means 2Y = 100, which again gives Y = 50.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of division. If the tree grows 2 rings per year, then the number of years is the total number of rings divided by the number of rings per year.\n\nSo, Y = R / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the rate of ring growth. The rate is 2 rings per year.\n\nSo, the time taken to grow 100 rings is 100 rings divided by the rate of 2 rings per year, which again gives 50 years.\n\nI think this makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the age of the tree.\n\nFor example, do trees start growing rings from the moment they're planted, or is there an initial period before they start adding rings?\n\nIn reality, trees start adding growth rings soon after they sprout, with each ring typically representing one growing season.\n\nHowever, in this problem, it's probably safe to assume that the tree starts adding rings from year 1.\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the tree is cut down after it has grown 100 rings, so we don't need to consider any partial rings or additional growth after the 100th ring.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the tree lived for 50 years.\n\nSo, the answer is 50 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
