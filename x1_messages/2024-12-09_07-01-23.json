        "content": "Let's see. So, in this village, every man has exactly 5 sons and each son has 2 sisters. I need to find out the ratio of boys to girls in the village based on this information.\n\nFirst, I should understand the family structure here. Let's consider one man in the village. This man has 5 sons. Now, each of these sons has 2 sisters. Hmm, so these sisters are daughters of the same man, right? Because they're siblings of the sons.\n\nSo, if the man has 5 sons and each son has 2 sisters, that means the man has 2 daughters in addition to his 5 sons. Wait, but if each son has 2 sisters, and these sisters are shared among all the sons, then the man has 5 sons and 2 daughters.\n\nLet me confirm that. If a man has 5 sons and 2 daughters, then each son has 2 sisters. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each man in the village, he has 5 sons and 2 daughters.\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of boys to girls in the entire village. Since every family follows this pattern, I can consider one family as representative of all families in the village.\n\nIn one family, there are 5 boys and 2 girls.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of boys to girls in one family is 5:2.\n\nSince this ratio is the same for every family in the village, the overall ratio of boys to girls in the village should also be 5:2.\n\nWait a minute, but I should think about whether this is accurate. Is it possible that the ratio could be different at the village level even if every family has the same composition?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose there are n men in the village. Each man has 5 sons and 2 daughters.\n\nSo, total number of boys in the village would be n men * 5 sons per man = 5n boys.\n\nTotal number of girls in the village would be n men * 2 daughters per man = 2n girls.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of boys to girls is 5n : 2n, which simplifies to 5:2.\n\nSo, regardless of the number of men in the village, the ratio remains 5:2.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this ratio.\n\nIs there any information given about women in the village who are not mothers, or families without men, or anything like that? No, the problem states that every man has exactly 5 sons and each son has 2 sisters.\n\nSo, assuming that all families are headed by a man and that all children belong to their father's family, this should cover the entire village population.\n\nAlso, assuming that there are no children without parents or any other complicating factors.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of boys to girls in the village is 5:2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5:2} \\]"
