        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that 6 machines produce 180 units in 2 hours. We need to find out how long it would take for 10 machines to produce 600 units.\n\nFirst, I think it's important to understand the relationship between the number of machines, the number of units they produce, and the time they take to do so. It seems like the number of machines and the number of units produced are directly proportional, while the time taken is inversely proportional to the number of machines.\n\nLet me try to break it down.\n\nIf 6 machines can produce 180 units in 2 hours, then one machine would produce fewer units in the same time. To find out how much one machine produces in 2 hours, I can divide the total units by the number of machines:\n\n180 units / 6 machines = 30 units per machine in 2 hours.\n\nSo, one machine produces 30 units in 2 hours. That means, in one hour, one machine produces:\n\n30 units / 2 hours = 15 units per hour.\n\nNow, if we have 10 machines, each producing 15 units per hour, the total production per hour would be:\n\n10 machines * 15 units per hour = 150 units per hour.\n\nWe need to produce 600 units. So, the time required would be:\n\n600 units / 150 units per hour = 4 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there's another way to look at it, maybe using proportions or some formula.\n\nI recall that for work problems involving machines, the formula often involves the product of the number of machines and the time they work equaling the work done. Maybe something like:\n\nNumber of machines * Time = Work\n\nBut to make it more accurate, perhaps I should consider the rate at which the machines work.\n\nLet me define the rate of one machine as R units per hour.\n\nThen, 6 machines working together have a rate of 6R units per hour.\n\nGiven that they produce 180 units in 2 hours, I can set up the equation:\n\n6R * 2 = 180\n\nSo, 12R = 180\n\nThen, R = 180 / 12 = 15 units per hour.\n\nThis matches what I calculated earlier: one machine produces 15 units per hour.\n\nNow, if we have 10 machines, their combined rate is 10 * 15 = 150 units per hour.\n\nTo produce 600 units at this rate, the time required is:\n\nTime = Work / Rate = 600 / 150 = 4 hours.\n\nSo, according to this, it would take 4 hours for 10 machines to produce 600 units.\n\nBut let me think if there's another approach, maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 6 machines produce 180 units in 2 hours, then we can find the number of units produced per machine per hour.\n\nFirst, total machine-hours for the initial scenario is 6 machines * 2 hours = 12 machine-hours.\n\nTotal units produced is 180, so units per machine-hour is 180 / 12 = 15 units per machine-hour.\n\nNow, if we have 10 machines, and we want to produce 600 units, we can find the total machine-hours needed:\n\nTotal machine-hours needed = Total units / units per machine-hour = 600 / 15 = 40 machine-hours.\n\nWith 10 machines working together, the time required would be:\n\nTime = Total machine-hours needed / Number of machines = 40 / 10 = 4 hours.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up a proportion based on the number of machines and the time taken.\n\nBut since the number of machines and the time are inversely proportional (more machines mean less time), I need to be careful.\n\nFirst, find the total work in terms of machine-hours.\n\nAs before, 6 machines * 2 hours = 12 machine-hours for 180 units.\n\nSo, for 600 units, which is 600 / 180 = 10/3 times more work, the machine-hours needed would be 12 * (10/3) = 40 machine-hours.\n\nThen, with 10 machines, the time required is 40 / 10 = 4 hours.\n\nYet another confirmation.\n\nLet me try one more way, just to be thorough.\n\nSuppose I find the rate of work per machine per hour.\n\nAs before, one machine produces 15 units per hour.\n\nSo, for 10 machines, the rate is 10 * 15 = 150 units per hour.\n\nTime to produce 600 units is 600 / 150 = 4 hours.\n\nAlright, I'm convinced that the answer is 4 hours.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? For example, are there any constraints in the factory that might affect production, like maintenance times, machine capacity, or worker availability?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any such constraints, so I think it's safe to assume that the machines operate continuously without any breaks.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the machines are assumed to work at a constant rate, and that there's no change in efficiency when more machines are added.\n\nGiven that, my calculation should hold.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's plug the numbers back into the original scenario.\n\nIf 6 machines produce 180 units in 2 hours, then in one hour, they produce 90 units.\n\nSo, the production rate is 90 units per hour for 6 machines.\n\nThat means each machine produces 15 units per hour, as I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, if we have 10 machines, their combined production rate is 10 * 15 = 150 units per hour.\n\nSo, to produce 600 units, it would take 600 / 150 = 4 hours.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The answer should be 4 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
