        "content": "Let's solve this system of equations using the substitution method. The system is:\n\n1. x + y = 5\n\n2. 2x - y = 1\n\nFirst, I'll solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve equation 1 for x:\n\nx = 5 - y\n\nNow, I'll substitute this expression for x into equation 2:\n\n2(5 - y) - y = 1\n\nNext, I'll distribute the 2:\n\n10 - 2y - y = 1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10 - 3y = 1\n\nNow, subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n-3y = -9\n\nThen, divide both sides by -3:\n\ny = 3\n\nNow that I have y, I'll substitute it back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 5 - 3\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 2, y = 3.\n\nTo check, I'll plug these values back into both equations:\n\nFor equation 1:\n\n2 + 3 = 5 \u2705\n\nFor equation 2:\n\n2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1 \u2705\n\nEverything checks out."
