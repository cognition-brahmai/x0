        "content": "In the world of botany, not every rose is a \"rose\" in the strictest sense. The term \"rose\" typically refers to plants of the genus Rosa, which includes a wide variety of flowering shrubs known for their beautiful blooms and often fragrant flowers. However, there are other plants that are called \"roses\" but belong to different genera or families.\n\nFor example, the Christmas rose (Helleborus niger) is not a true rose; it belongs to the family Ranunculaceae. Similarly, the beach rose or sea holly (Eryngium maritimum) is not a rose but belongs to the family Apiaceae. There are also roses in poetry and literature that may refer to the idea or essence of a rose rather than the physical plant.\n\nSo, while in common parlance, \"rose\" often refers to the classic flowering shrub, botanically speaking, not every \"rose\" is a member of the genus Rosa."
