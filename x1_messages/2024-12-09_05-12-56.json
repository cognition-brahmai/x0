Below is a PowerShell script that automates the process of backing up files in a given directory by copying them to another location and appending the current date and time to the copied filenames.\n\n```powershell\n# Define source and destination directories\n$sourceDir = \"C:\\path\\to\\source\\directory\"\n$destinationDir = \"C:\\path\\to\\destination\\directory\"\n\n# Get the current date and time\n$dateTime = Get-Date -Format \"yyyyMMdd_HHmmss\"\n\n# Get all files in the source directory\n$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $sourceDir -File\n\nforeach ($file in $files) {\n    # Construct the new filename with date and time appended\n    $newFileName = \"{0}_{1}{2}\" -f $file.BaseName, $dateTime, $file.Extension\n    $destinationPath = Join-Path -Path $destinationDir -ChildPath $newFileName\n    \n    # Copy the file to the destination directory with the new filename\n    Copy-Item -Path $file.FullName -Destination $destinationPath -Force\n    \n    Write-Output \"Copied '$($file.Name)' to '$newFileName'\"\n}\n\nWrite-Output \"Backup complete.\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Define Source and Destination Directories:**\n   - Set the `$sourceDir` variable to the path of the directory you want to back up.\n   - Set the `$destinationDir` variable to the path where you want to store the backups.\n\n2. **Get Current Date and Time:**\n   - Use `Get-Date` with a specific format to get the current date and time as a string.\n\n3. **Get All Files in Source Directory:**\n   - Use `Get-ChildItem` with the `-File` parameter to retrieve all files in the source directory.\n\n4. **Loop Through Each File:**\n   - For each file, construct a new filename by appending the date and time string.\n   - Use `Join-Path` to create the full destination path.\n   - Use `Copy-Item` to copy the file to the destination directory with the new filename.\n   - Output a message indicating the file has been copied.\n\n5. **Completion Message:**\n   - Output a message indicating that the backup process is complete.\n\nMake sure to adjust the `$sourceDir` and `$destinationDir` variables to match your specific directory paths. This script will handle copying all files from the source directory to the destination directory, ensuring each copied file has a unique name based on the current date and time."
