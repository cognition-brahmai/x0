This is a common myth, but it's not based on scientific fact.\n\nWhen you shave hair, you're cutting it at the surface of the skin. The part that's left is the blunt end of the hair shaft, which may feel coarser or thicker than the tapered end that was originally there. However, the actual thickness and color of the hair remain the same.\n\nHair growth is determined by factors such as genetics, hormone levels, and overall health, not by how you remove or cut the hair above the skin's surface. So, shaving won't make your hair grow back thicker or darker."
