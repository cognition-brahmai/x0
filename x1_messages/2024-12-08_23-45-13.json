        "content": "Alright, I'll help you write a Python script that connects to an SQLite database, creates a table named \"students\" with columns for name, age, and major, and inserts some sample data into it. SQLite is a great choice for small to medium applications because it's serverless, easy to set up, and doesn't require any configuration.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Python installed on your system. SQLite comes pre-installed with Python\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5e93, so you don't need to install any additional packages.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Import the SQLite3 module:**\n   This module provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn\u2019t require a separate server process.\n\n2. **Connect to the SQLite database:**\n   You can specify the name of the database file. If it doesn't exist, SQLite will create it automatically.\n\n3. **Create a table:**\n   Define the structure of the \"students\" table with columns for name, age, and major.\n\n4. **Insert sample data:**\n   Add some records to the \"students\" table.\n\n5. **Commit the changes and close the connection:**\n   Ensure that all changes are saved and properly close the database connection.\n\nHere\u2019s the complete Python script:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)\nconn = sqlite3.connect('students.db')\n\n# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Create the \"students\" table\ncursor.execute('''\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    age INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    major TEXT NOT NULL\n)\n''')\n\n# Insert sample data into the \"students\" table\nsample_data = [\n    ('Alice', 20, 'Computer Science'),\n    ('Bob', 22, 'Mathematics'),\n    ('Charlie', 21, 'Physics')\n]\n\ncursor.executemany('''\nINSERT INTO students (name, age, major) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\n''', sample_data)\n\n# Commit the changes and close the connection\nconn.commit()\nconn.close()\n\nprint(\"Database and table created successfully. Sample data inserted.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Connecting to the Database:**\n   - `sqlite3.connect('students.db')` connects to the SQLite database named `students.db`. If this file doesn't exist, it will be created in the same directory as your script.\n\n2. **Creating a Table:**\n   - The `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students ...` command creates a table named \"students\" with columns for `id`, `name`, `age`, and `major`. The `id` column is set as the primary key and auto-increments for each new record.\n\n3. **Inserting Data:**\n   - Sample data is inserted using the `executemany` method, which is efficient for inserting multiple records at once.\n\n4. **Committing and Closing:**\n   - Changes are committed to the database with `conn.commit()`, and the connection is closed with `conn.close()` to free up resources.\n\nThis script sets up a basic database with a \"students\" table and populates it with sample data. You can run this script in your Python environment, and it should work without issues. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
