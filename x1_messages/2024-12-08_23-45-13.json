        "content": "So I've got this improper integral to evaluate: the integral from 1 to infinity of 1 over x cubed dx. Yeah, I remember that improper integrals are tricky because they go to infinity or have some other issue like a discontinuity. But let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an improper integral is. It's basically a definite integral where one or both limits are infinite, or where the integrand has a discontinuity in the interval. In this case, the upper limit is infinity, so that's what makes it improper.\n\nTo evaluate this, I should probably turn it into a limit. So, the integral from 1 to infinity of 1 over x cubed dx can be written as the limit as t approaches infinity of the integral from 1 to t of 1 over x cubed dx. That makes sense because we're approaching infinity gradually with t.\n\nNow, let's focus on the integral from 1 to t of 1 over x cubed dx. I need to find the antiderivative of 1 over x cubed. Hmm, 1 over x cubed is the same as x to the power of -3, right? So, the antiderivative of x^-3 should be x^(-3 + 1) over (-3 + 1), which is x^-2 over -2, or -1/(2x^2). Wait, let me double-check that.\n\nYes, the general rule for integrating x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), as long as n isn't -1. Here, n is -3, so n+1 is -2, and dividing by n+1 is dividing by -2, which gives -1/(2x^2). Alright, so the antiderivative is -1/(2x^2).\n\nNow, I need to evaluate this antiderivative from 1 to t. So, that's -1/(2t^2) minus (-1/(2*1^2)), which simplifies to -1/(2t^2) + 1/2.\n\nNext, I take the limit as t approaches infinity of that expression: limit as t approaches infinity of (-1/(2t^2) + 1/2).\n\nLet's see, as t gets really large, t squared gets even larger, so 1 over 2t squared approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is 0 + 1/2, which is 1/2.\n\nSo, the value of the improper integral from 1 to infinity of 1 over x cubed dx is 1/2.\n\nWait a second, does that make sense? Let me see if there's another way to check this. Maybe I can think about the area under the curve. From x=1 to infinity, 1 over x cubed is a positive function that decreases rapidly as x increases. So, the area should be finite, which matches my result of 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for integrals of the form 1 over x^p from 1 to infinity, the integral converges if p > 1 and diverges if p <= 1. Here, p is 3, which is greater than 1, so it should converge, which it did, to 1/2.\n\nIs there another way to confirm this? Maybe I can use a different method to evaluate the integral. Let's try using substitution. Suppose I let u = 1/x, then du/dx = -1/x^2, so dx = -x^2 du. But x = 1/u, so dx = -\uff081/u^2\uff09du.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe it's not necessary since I already have the answer, but let's try to see.\n\nWhen x=1, u=1. When x approaches infinity, u approaches 0.\n\nSo, the integral becomes integral from u=1 to u=0 of 1/(1/u)^3 * (-1/u^2) du.\n\nSimplify that: 1/(1/u)^3 is u^3, and multiplied by -1/u^2 is -u^3 / u^2 = -u.\n\nSo, the integral is integral from 1 to 0 of -u du.\n\nWhich is the same as integral from 0 to 1 of u du.\n\nIntegrate u du is u^2 / 2, evaluated from 0 to 1, which is 1/2 - 0 = 1/2.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. Good, it's consistent.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using comparison tests? For example, since 1 over x^3 is less than 1 over x^2 for x > 1, and I know that integral of 1 over x^2 from 1 to infinity converges to 1, then by comparison, my integral should also converge, which it did.\n\nMoreover, I can think about the p-series test, where the integral test is related to the convergence of the p-series. For p > 1, the integral converges, which aligns with my p=3 case.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what would happen if p=3 was changed to something else. For example, if p=1, the integral would be integral of 1/x from 1 to infinity, which is ln(x) from 1 to t, and as t approaches infinity, ln(t) goes to infinity, so it diverges.\n\nIf p=2, it would be integral of 1/x^2 from 1 to infinity, which is -1/x from 1 to t, and as t approaches infinity, it's 0 - (-1) = 1, so it converges to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for p=3, it converges to 1/2, as I found.\n\nWait, actually, for general p > 1, the integral of 1/x^p from 1 to infinity is 1/(p-1), I think. Let me verify that.\n\nThe antiderivative of x^-p is x^(-p+1)/(-p+1), assuming p \u2260 1.\n\nSo, evaluated from 1 to t, it's [x^(-p+1)/(-p+1)] from 1 to t.\n\nTaking the limit as t approaches infinity: if p > 1, then -p+1 < 0, so t^(-p+1) approaches 0.\n\nTherefore, the integral converges to 0 - (1^(-p+1)/(-p+1)) = -1/(-p+1) = 1/(p-1).\n\nYes, so in general, integral from 1 to infinity of 1/x^p dx is 1/(p-1) for p > 1.\n\nIn my original problem, p=3, so 1/(3-1) = 1/2, which matches my calculation.\n\nSo, not only did I confirm it through direct calculation and substitution, but also through the general formula for the p-integral.\n\nI think I've thoroughly verified that the integral is indeed 1/2.\n\nJust one more thing: what if the lower limit was different? Say, from a to infinity, where a > 0.\n\nWell, the antiderivative would still be the same, and the evaluation would adjust accordingly.\n\nBut in my case, a=1, which works out nicely.\n\nAlternatively, if a=0, that would be a different story, because there's a discontinuity at x=0 for 1/x^3.\n\nBut since my lower limit is 1, I don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the improper integral from 1 to infinity of 1 over x cubed dx equals 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
