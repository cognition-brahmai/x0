They have three types of aircraft available: small (50 seats), medium (100 seats), and large (200 seats). The operating costs are $2,000, $3,500, and $5,000 per flight, respectively. The airline needs to schedule at least 10 flights per day to meet the daily demand of 1,200 passengers. Determine the optimal mix of aircraft sizes and number of flights to minimize operating costs while meeting passenger demand. Explain your reasoning."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal mix of aircraft sizes (small, medium, and large) and the number of flights for each type to minimize operating costs while meeting the daily demand of 1,200 passengers and scheduling at least 10 flights per day.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of small aircraft flights.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of medium aircraft flights.\n\n- Let \\( z \\) be the number of large aircraft flights.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. The total number of flights should be at least 10:\n\n\\[ x + y + z \\geq 10 \\]\n\n2. The total passenger capacity should be at least 1,200:\n\n\\[ 50x + 100y + 200z \\geq 1,200 \\]\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total operating cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = 2000x + 3500y + 5000z \\]\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use linear programming techniques. However, since this is a relatively simple problem, we can also approach it through logical reasoning and iteration.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cost per passenger for each aircraft type:\n\n- Small aircraft: \\( \\frac{2000}{50} = 40 \\) dollars per passenger\n\n- Medium aircraft: \\( \\frac{3500}{100} = 35 \\) dollars per passenger\n\n- Large aircraft: \\( \\frac{5000}{200} = 25 \\) dollars per passenger\n\nFrom this, the large aircraft is the most cost-effective in terms of cost per passenger, followed by the medium, and then the small aircraft. Therefore, to minimize costs, we should maximize the use of large aircraft while meeting the constraints.\n\nLet's start by maximizing the number of large aircraft flights.\n\n**Case 1: Using only large aircraft**\n\n- Each large aircraft carries 200 passengers.\n\n- Number of large aircraft needed: \\( \\lceil \\frac{1200}{200} \\rceil = 6 \\) flights.\n\n- Total passengers: \\( 6 \\times 200 = 1200 \\)\n\n- Total flights: 6, which is less than the required 10 flights.\n\n- So, we need to add more flights with smaller aircraft.\n\n**Case 2: Using 6 large aircraft and filling the remaining flights with smaller aircraft**\n\n- Passengers carried by large aircraft: \\( 6 \\times 200 = 1200 \\)\n\n- Remaining passengers: 0\n\n- Total flights so far: 6\n\n- Need at least 10 flights, so need 4 more flights.\n\n- These additional flights can be small or medium aircraft, but since they are not needed for passenger capacity, they would only increase costs.\n\n- Therefore, this option is not optimal.\n\n**Case 3: Using 5 large aircraft and complementing with medium and/or small aircraft**\n\n- Passengers carried by large aircraft: \\( 5 \\times 200 = 1000 \\)\n\n- Remaining passengers: \\( 1200 - 1000 = 200 \\)\n\n- Total flights so far: 5\n\n- Need at least 10 flights, so need 5 more flights.\n\n- To carry the remaining 200 passengers, we can use two medium aircraft (200 passengers) or four small aircraft (200 passengers), or a combination.\n\n- Option 1: 5 large + 2 medium + 3 small = 10 flights\n\n- Passengers: \\( 1000 + 200 + 150 = 1350 \\) (exceeds requirement)\n\n- Cost: \\( 5 \\times 5000 + 2 \\times 3500 + 3 \\times 2000 = 25,000 + 7,000 + 6,000 = 38,000 \\)\n\n- Option 2: 5 large + 1 medium + 4 small = 10 flights\n\n- Passengers: \\( 1000 + 100 + 200 = 1300 \\) (exceeds requirement)\n\n- Cost: \\( 5 \\times 5000 + 1 \\times 3500 + 4 \\times 2000 = 25,000 + 3,500 + 8,000 = 36,500 \\)\n\n- Option 3: 5 large + 0 medium + 5 small = 10 flights\n\n- Passengers: \\( 1000 + 0 + 250 = 1250 \\) (meets requirement)\n\n- Cost: \\( 5 \\times 5000 + 0 \\times 3500 + 5 \\times 2000 = 25,000 + 0 + 10,000 = 35,000 \\)\n\n**Case 4: Using 4 large aircraft and complementing with medium and small aircraft**\n\n- Passengers carried by large aircraft: \\( 4 \\times 200 = 800 \\)\n\n- Remaining passengers: \\( 1200 -
