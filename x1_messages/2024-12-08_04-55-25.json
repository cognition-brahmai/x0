        "content": "Dear Mark,\n\nI hope this letter finds you well, wherever you are. I've been sitting down to write this for what feels like an eternity, but every time I try, the words seem too heavy, too full of pain and regret to put on paper. But today, I feel like I have to try. I need to tell you why I left, why I had to leave you behind all those years ago.\n\nFirstly, I want you to know that leaving you was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. It's a decision that haunts me every single day, a weight that presses down on my chest, making it hard to breathe sometimes. I never, ever wanted to abandon you, Mark. You were my everything, my best friend, my confidant, my partner in crime. I loved you more than words could express.\n\nBut life isn't always kind, is it? Sometimes, it throws curveballs at us when we least expect them, and we're left picking up the pieces, trying to make sense of it all. That's what happened to us, Mark. Remember that summer when we were kids? The one that changed everything?\n\nOur parents were going through a rough patch, and one night, things escalated. I remember the shouting, the slamming doors, the fear in your eyes as you hid behind me. I was only ten, but I had to be strong for you, had to protect you from the monsters that were our own parents.\n\nIn the midst of all that chaos, I made a decision. A decision that would alter the course of both our lives forever. I decided to run away, to take you with me, to find a place where we could be safe, where we could be together without the fear of violence hanging over our heads.\n\nBut as we were about to leave that night, something happened. You were scared, Mark, and I could see it in your eyes. You were trembling, clutching my hand tight, as if afraid to let go. And then, out of nowhere, our dad appeared, blocking our path. He was angry, drunk, and he saw us trying to escape.\n\nI pushed you behind me, trying to shield you from him, telling you to run, to find safety. But you wouldn't leave me, Mark. You clung to me, crying, begging me not to go. And in that moment, I knew that if I took you with me, both of us would be in even greater danger. Our dad was unstable, and I couldn't risk your safety.\n\nSo, with a heavy heart, I made the most difficult choice of my life. I told you to stay, to wait for me, promising that I would come back for you as soon as I could. I kissed your forehead, wiped away your tears, and walked away, leaving you there, alone.\n\nI never forgot you, Mark. Every day, I thought about you, wondered what had become of you, if you were safe, if you were happy. I tried to find you over the years, but it was like you'd fallen off the face of the earth. Maybe you didn't want to be found, and I can't say I blame you.\n\nI've lived with this guilt for so long, Mark. It's eaten away at me, consumed me, made me question whether I did the right thing. Maybe I should have taken you with me, fought for both of us. But in that moment, I believed that leaving you behind was the only way to keep you safe.\n\nNow, all these years later, I don't know what to expect from you. Maybe you hate me, and I can't blame you if you do. I deserve your anger, your resentment. But I also hope that somehow, you can find it in your heart to understand why I did what I did.\n\nI just wanted to protect you, Mark. Even if it meant sacrificing our relationship, even if it meant living with this immense pain for the rest of my life. I love you, brother. More than anything in this world.\n\nPlease, if you're reading this, know that I'm here for you now. I'll do whatever it takes to make things right between us, to rebuild the bond we once shared. I miss you more than words can say.\n\nWith all my love and sorrow,\n\nSarah"
