Here is the place my Lord, good my Lord enter, The tirrany of the open night's too rough For Nature to endure.\nStorme still\nLear. Let me alone\nKent. Good my Lord enter heere\nLear. Wilt breake my heart? Kent. I had rather breake mine owne, Good my Lord enter\nLear. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storme Inuades vs to the skin so: 'tis to thee, But where the greater malady is fixt, The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a Beare, But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea, Thou'dst meete the Beare i'th' mouth, when the mind's free, The bodies delicate: the tempest in my mind, Doth from my sences take all feeling else, Saue what beates there, Filliall ingratitude, Is it not as this mouth should teare this hand For lifting food too't? But I will punish home; No, I will weepe no more; in such a night, To shut me out? Poure on, I will endure: In such a night as this? O Regan, Gonerill, Your old kind Father, whose franke heart gaue all, O that way madnesse lies, let me shun that: No more of that\nKent. Good my Lord enter here\nLear. Prythee go in thy selfe, seeke thine owne ease, This tempest will not giue me leaue to ponder On things would hurt me more, but Ile goe in, In Boy, go first. You houselesse pouertie, Enter.\nNay get thee in; Ile pray, and then Ile sleepe. Poore naked wretches, where so ere you are That bide the pelting of this pittilesse storme, How shall your House-lesse heads, and vnfed sides, Your lop'd, and window'd raggednesse defend you From seasons such as these? O I haue tane Too little care of this: Take Physicke, Pompe, Expose thy selfe to feele what wretches feele, That thou maist shake the superflux to them, And shew the Heauens more iust.

Who giues any thing to poore Tom? Whom the foule fiend hath led through Fire, and through Flame, through Sword, and Whirle-Poole, o're Bog, and Quagmire, that hath laid Kniues vnder his Pillow, and Halters in his Pue, set Rats-bane by his Porredge, made him Proud of heart, to ride on a Bay trotting Horse, ouer foure incht Bridges, to course his owne shadow for a Traitor. Blisse thy fiue Wits, Toms a cold. O do, de, do, de, do, de, blisse thee from Whirle-Windes, Starre-blasting, and taking, do poore Tom some charitie, whom the foule Fiend vexes.

What hast thou bin? Edg. A Seruingman? Proud in heart, and minde; that curl'd my haire, wore Gloues in my cap; seru'd the Lust of my Mistris heart, and did the acte of darkenesse with her. Swore as many Oathes, as I spake words, & broke them in the sweet face of Heauen. One, that slept in the contriuing of Lust, and wak'd to doe it. Wine lou'd I deerely, Dice deerely; and in Woman, out-Paramour'd the Turke. False of heart, light of eare, bloody of hand; Hog in sloth, Foxe in stealth, Wolfe in greedinesse, Dog in madnes, Lyon in prey.

        "content": "I've read through this scene from King Lear, and I need to summarize it in about 250 words. Okay, so this is Scene 4 of Act 3. Lear, Kent, and the Fool are out in a storm. Kent tries to get Lear to go inside, but Lear wants to be alone. Lear is upset about being cast out by his daughters, Regan and Goneril. He's reflecting on their ingratitude and the harshness of his situation.\n\nKent keeps trying to persuade Lear to seek shelter, but Lear is resistant. He says that the storm is not as painful as the misery in his mind. He's angry and wants to punish his daughters for their treatment of him. But then he changes his mind and says he won't cry anymore. He's determined to endure the storm.\n\nMeanwhile, Edgar, disguised as Poor Tom, and the Fool are also out in the storm. Kent finds them and tries to help. Lear is moved by the plight of the homeless and realizes he hasn't done enough for the poor in his own kingdom.\n\nThere's a lot of dialogue here about the nature of humanity and the cruelty of those in power. Lear is starting to see the world in a different light, perhaps gaining some wisdom from his suffering.\n\nGloucester shows up with a torch, defying his daughters' orders to leave Lear out in the storm. He offers to take Lear to a place where he can get warm and have food. Lear wants to talk to the philosophical Poor Tom before going in.\n\nThere's a bit where Lear questions Tom about the cause of thunder, and Tom talks about how to prevent the devil and kill vermin. It's clear that Tom is not a scholar, but Lear is in a state of confusion and perhaps madness.\n\nKent urges Lear to accept Gloucester's help, but Lear wants to stay with his new companion, the philosopher. Gloucester mentions that he has a son who has tried to kill him, adding to the theme of familial betrayal.\n\nOverall, this scene shows Lear's continued descent into madness and his growing sympathy for the needy, while also highlighting the widespread betrayal and cruelty in the kingdom.\n\nAlright, that should be around 250 words. I think that captures the main points of the scene.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\nIn this pivotal scene from King Lear, Act 3, Scene 4, Lear, accompanied by Kent and the Fool, endures a raging storm, symbolizing the turmoil within and without. Kent repeatedly urges Lear to seek shelter, but Lear is resolute in his decision to remain exposed to nature's wrath, reflecting his inner anguish over his daughters' betrayal. Lear's soliloquy reveals his profound distress and a burgeoning realization of his past failings towards the less fortunate.\n\nMeanwhile, Edgar, in disguise as Poor Tom, and the Fool also seek refuge from the storm. Their presence underscores the universality of suffering and the vulnerability of humanity in the face of cruelty and injustice. Gloucester arrives, defying his daughters' orders, to offer Lear shelter and support, highlighting the contrast between loyalty and betrayal among the characters.\n\nThroughout the scene, Lear engages in philosophical musings, particularly with Poor Tom, indicating a possible shift in his perspective and a growing empathy for the downtrodden. The scene culminates in Gloucester's offer to provide Lear with warmth and sustenance, which Lear accepts, albeit reluctantly, continuing his journey towards redemption and self-realization. This act also emphasizes the theme of familial ingratitude and the broader moral decay within the kingdom."
