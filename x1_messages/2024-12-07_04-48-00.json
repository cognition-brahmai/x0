        "content": "Let's see. There are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in each hour. So, to find out how many minutes are in a day, I would multiply 24 by 60, right? That should give me the total minutes in a day.\n\nSo, 24 hours/day \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes/day.\n\nNow, there are 7 days in a week, so to find out how many minutes are in a week, I should multiply the number of minutes in a day by 7.\n\nSo, 1440 minutes/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 10080 minutes/week.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to think about it. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week, so there are 24 \u00d7 7 = 168 hours in a week.\n\nThen, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 168 hours/week \u00d7 60 minutes/hour should also give me the total minutes in a week.\n\nSo, 168 \u00d7 60. Let's calculate that: 160 \u00d7 60 is 9600, and 8 \u00d7 60 is 480, so 9600 + 480 equals 10080 minutes in a week.\n\nBoth methods give me the same answer, so I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10080} \\]"
