        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company that produces two types of products, A and B. Each product requires a certain amount of labor hours, and there's a maximum amount of labor hours available per week. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit based on the profits per unit of each product. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints and the objective. The constraints are the labor hours required for each product and the total available labor hours. The objective is to maximize profit.\n\nLet's define some variables:\n\n- Let x be the number of units of product A.\n\n- Let y be the number of units of product B.\n\nNow, each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor, and each unit of product B requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a maximum of 240 hours of labor available per week. So, the labor constraint can be expressed as:\n\n2x + 3y \u2264 240\n\nAlso, since the number of units produced can't be negative, we have:\n\nx \u2265 0\n\ny \u2265 0\n\nThe profit per unit of product A is $10, and the profit per unit of product B is $15. Therefore, the total profit P can be expressed as:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nOur goal is to maximize P, given the constraints.\n\nThis seems like a linear programming problem, where we have linear inequalities defining a feasible region, and we want to find the point within that region that maximizes the objective function.\n\nTo solve this, I can graph the feasible region defined by the inequalities and find the vertices. Then, evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, let's graph the labor constraint:\n\n2x + 3y \u2264 240\n\nTo graph this, it's helpful to find the intercepts.\n\nWhen x = 0:\n\n2(0) + 3y = 240\n\n3y = 240\n\ny = 80\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 80).\n\nWhen y = 0:\n\n2x + 3(0) = 240\n\n2x = 240\n\nx = 120\n\nSo, the x-intercept is (120, 0).\n\nPlotting these points and drawing the line 2x + 3y = 240, the feasible region is below this line, including the axes, since x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0.\n\nNow, the feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (120,0), (0,80), and the point where the labor constraint line intersects the axes.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, the feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (120,0), and (0,80), because the labor constraint line intersects the x-axis at (120,0) and the y-axis at (0,80).\n\nBut actually, no, the labor constraint is 2x + 3y \u2264 240, so the feasible region is all points (x,y) such that 2x + 3y \u2264 240, x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0.\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are:\n\n1. (0,0)\n\n2. (120,0)\n\n3. (0,80)\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the profit function P = 10x + 15y at each of these vertices and find which one gives the maximum P.\n\nFirst, at (0,0):\n\nP = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n\nAt (120,0):\n\nP = 10(120) + 15(0) = $1200\n\nAt (0,80):\n\nP = 10(0) + 15(80) = $1200\n\nSo, both (120,0) and (0,80) give a profit of $1200, while (0,0) gives $0.\n\nWait, but is there a point inside the feasible region that gives a higher profit?\n\nIn linear programming, the maximum or minimum of the objective function always occurs at one of the vertices of the feasible region, assuming the feasible region is bounded.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the maximum profit is $1200, which can be achieved by producing either 120 units of product A and no units of product B, or no units of product A and 80 units of product B.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nSuppose the company produces a combination of both products A and B.\n\nFor example, let's say they produce x units of A and y units of B, such that 2x + 3y \u2264 240.\n\nIs there a combination where P = 10x + 15y is greater than $1200?\n\nLet me try to see.\n\nSuppose x = 60, y = 40.\n\nThen, 2(60) + 3(40) = 120 + 120 = 240, which is within the labor constraint.\n\nProfit P = 10(60) + 15(40) = 600 + 600 = $1200, which is the same as the vertex points.\n\nAnother combination: x = 30, y = 60.\n\nThen, 2(30) + 3(60) = 60 + 180 = 240, which is within the constraint.\n\nProfit P = 10(30) + 15(60) = 300 + 900 = $1200 again.\n\nWait, what if x = 90, y = 20.\n\nThen, 2(90) + 3(20) = 180 + 60 = 240, which is within the constraint.\n\nProfit P = 10(90) + 15(20) = 900 + 300 = $1200 once more.\n\nIt seems like any combination on the boundary gives a profit of $1200, and the vertex points give the same profit.\n\nBut according to linear programming theory, the maximum must occur at a vertex.\n\nSo, in this case, it seems that the maximum profit is $1200, achievable by producing either:\n\n- 120 units of A and 0 units of B, or\n\n- 0 units of A and 80 units of B, or\n\n- any combination of A and B such that 2x + 3y = 240, which all seem to give P = $1200.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. It seems that along the entire line 2x + 3y = 240, the profit is constant at $1200.\n\nLet me see if that's always the case.\n\nSo, P = 10x + 15y\n\nWe can simplify P by dividing by 5: P/5 = 2x + 3y\n\nSo, P = 5(2x + 3y)\n\nGiven that 2x + 3y \u2264 240, the maximum P occurs when 2x + 3y is maximized, which is when 2x + 3y = 240.\n\nSo, P = 5 * 240 = $1200.\n\nTherefore, any combination of x and y that satisfies 2x + 3y = 240 will yield P = $1200.\n\nTherefore, the company can choose any combination of A and B that uses all 240 hours of labor to achieve the maximum profit of $1200 per week.\n\nSo, to answer the question, the company should produce either:\n\n- 120 units of A and 0 units of B, or\n\n- 0 units of A and 80 units of B, or\n\n- Any combination of A and B where 2x + 3y = 240.\n\nAll such combinations will yield the same maximum profit of $1200 per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120 \\text{ units of A and } 0 \\text{ units of B, or } 0 \\text{ units of A and } 80 \\text{ units of B, or any combination where } 2x + 3y = 240} \\]"
