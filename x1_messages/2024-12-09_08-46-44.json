        "content": "Let's see. So, the group spent $200 on food, and they want to leave a 15% tip for the server. I need to find out the total amount they spent, including the tip.\n\nFirst, I should calculate what 15% of $200 is, and then add that to the original $200.\n\nTo find 15% of $200, I can multiply 200 by 0.15 because percentages are out of 100, and 15% is the same as 15/100 or 0.15.\n\nSo, 200 multiplied by 0.15 is:\n\n200 \u00d7 0.15 = 30\n\nSo, the tip is $30.\n\nNow, to find the total amount spent, I need to add the tip to the original amount:\n\n200 + 30 = 230\n\nTherefore, the total amount they spent, including the tip, is $230.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this? Maybe there's a simpler way to do it in one step.\n\nActually, yes. I could have thought of it as calculating 115% of $200, because 100% is the original amount, and 15% is the tip, so together it's 115%.\n\nTo find 115% of $200, I can multiply 200 by 1.15.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n200 \u00d7 1.15 = 230\n\nYep, same answer, $230.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using fractions?\n\nWell, 15% is the same as 15/100, which can be simplified to 3/20.\n\nSo, to find 15% of $200, I can calculate 3/20 of 200.\n\n3/20 \u00d7 200 = (3 \u00d7 200) / 20 = 600 / 20 = 30\n\nAgain, the tip is $30, and adding that to $200 gives $230.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, multiple methods lead to the same answer. That gives me more confidence that $230 is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should consider. For example, are there taxes or anything else added to the bill?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any sales tax or anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume that the only additions to the bill are the tip.\n\nIf there was sales tax, that would typically be added to the bill before calculating the tip, but since it's not mentioned, I'll proceed with just the tip.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total amount spent by the group, including the tip, is $230.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{230} \\]"
