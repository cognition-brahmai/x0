It's been far too long since we last caught up, and I find myself often drifting back to those golden days of our youth. The memories of our summers spent by the creek, chasing after fireflies, and sipping on that lemonade we used to make together still bring a warm smile to my face.\n\nDo you remember that old, weathered bridge that led us to our secret spot? The one with the railing that creaked with every step, making us giggle with both fear and excitement? On the other side was our paradise\u2014a shallow part of the creek where we would spend hours catching minnows and trying to identify all the different types of rocks. I still have that smooth, white pebble you gave me, the one you said looked like a miniature swan.\n\nAnd oh, those fireflies! There was something magical about watching them dance around in the twilight. We used to race each other to catch the most, but in reality, it was always a competition we both won because the jar was never big enough to hold all our treasures. Remember how we\u2019d release them at night, creating a living lantern to light up our lemonade stand? People would come from miles around just to see our little spectacle and buy a glass of that refreshing lemonade.\n\nSpeaking of lemonade, I must say, our recipe was unbeatable. Grandma\u2019s secret ingredient\u2014maybe a pinch of nutmeg or a sprig of mint\u2014always gave it that extra zing. We\u2019d set up our stand under the big oak tree, and there we were, two young entrepreneurs hoping to make our fortunes one cup at a time. In reality, we were just happy to spend the afternoon together, laughing and dreaming about what the future held.\n\nI often think back to those times with such fondness. Life has a way of speeding by, doesn\u2019t it? Before you know it, the carefree days of childhood are but a distant memory. But for me, they remain vivid and dear, especially when I think of you, my dearest friend.\n\nPerhaps one day, when the world slows down a bit, we can revisit those places and relive some of those moments. It would be lovely to share stories with you again, to see if that old bridge still stands, and to maybe even make a batch of that lemonade.\n\nUntil then, take care of yourself, Alice. Know that you hold a special place in my heart, and that our friendship is one of the brightest lights from my past.\n\nWith all my love,\n\nMary"
