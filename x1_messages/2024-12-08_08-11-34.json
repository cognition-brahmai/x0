        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets in batches of 25, and each widget weighs 0.8 kg. They need to ship these widgets using boxes that can hold up to 16 kg each. I need to find out the minimum number of boxes required to ship one batch.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total weight of a batch of widgets. Since each batch has 25 widgets and each widget weighs 0.8 kg, the total weight is 25 times 0.8 kg.\n\nTotal weight = 25 widgets * 0.8 kg/widget = 20 kg\n\nSo, the entire batch weighs 20 kg. Now, each box can hold up to 16 kg. I need to figure out how many boxes are needed to carry 20 kg, given that each box can carry up to 16 kg.\n\nIf I divide the total weight by the capacity of one box, I get:\n\nNumber of boxes = Total weight / Box capacity = 20 kg / 16 kg = 1.25\n\nBut I can't have a fraction of a box; I need whole boxes. So, I need to round up 1.25 to the next whole number, which is 2.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if that's correct. If I use 1 box, it can hold 16 kg, but the total weight is 20 kg, which is more than 16 kg. So, 1 box isn't enough. If I use 2 boxes, each holding 16 kg, that's a total capacity of 32 kg, which is more than enough for 20 kg. But is there a way to use fewer than 2 boxes?\n\nNo, since 1 box isn't sufficient, I need at least 2 boxes. But let me think about how the widgets are distributed between the boxes.\n\nEach widget weighs 0.8 kg, and each box can hold up to 16 kg. So, the number of widgets per box can be calculated by dividing the box capacity by the weight per widget.\n\nNumber of widgets per box = Box capacity / Weight per widget = 16 kg / 0.8 kg/widget = 20 widgets\n\nSo, each box can hold up to 20 widgets. Since the batch has 25 widgets, I can put 20 widgets in the first box and the remaining 5 in the second box.\n\nLet me verify the weights:\n\nFirst box: 20 widgets * 0.8 kg/widget = 16 kg\n\nSecond box: 5 widgets * 0.8 kg/widget = 4 kg\n\nTotal boxes used: 2\n\nIs there a way to use fewer boxes? If I try to put more widgets in the first box, say 21 widgets:\n\n21 widgets * 0.8 kg/widget = 16.8 kg\n\nBut the box capacity is only 16 kg, so that's over capacity. Therefore, I can't put more than 20 widgets in one box.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to distribute the widgets differently, say 18 in the first box and 7 in the second:\n\nFirst box: 18 widgets * 0.8 kg/widget = 14.4 kg\n\nSecond box: 7 widgets * 0.8 kg/widget = 5.6 kg\n\nStill, two boxes are used, and neither exceeds the capacity.\n\nAlternatively, 19 in the first box and 6 in the second:\n\nFirst box: 19 * 0.8 = 15.2 kg\n\nSecond box: 6 * 0.8 = 4.8 kg\n\nAgain, two boxes are used.\n\nSo, in all scenarios, I need at least two boxes to ship the batch of 25 widgets.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to use more boxes to save on shipping, but the question asks for the minimum number of boxes needed.\n\nIs there any way that using more than two boxes could reduce the total number needed? For example, using three boxes:\n\nFirst box: 10 widgets * 0.8 kg/widget = 8 kg\n\nSecond box: 10 widgets * 0.8 kg/widget = 8 kg\n\nThird box: 5 widgets * 0.8 kg/widget = 4 kg\n\nBut this uses three boxes, which is more than two. So, two boxes are still the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, four boxes:\n\nEach box with 5 widgets: 5 * 0.8 kg/widget = 4 kg per box\n\nBut that's four boxes, which is more than two.\n\nTherefore, two boxes are indeed the minimum required.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor that could affect the number of boxes needed. For example, maybe the boxes have a size limitation besides weight, but the question only mentions the weight capacity, so I assume size isn't an issue.\n\nAlso, perhaps some widgets are heavier than others, but the question states that each widget weighs 0.8 kg, so they all weigh the same.\n\nAdditionally, maybe the boxes can't be filled to the maximum capacity for some reason, but based on the information provided, there's no such restriction.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of boxes needed to ship a batch of 25 widgets is 2.\n\nWait, but in reality, shipping companies might have rules about partial fills or other constraints, but since the question doesn't mention any such constraints, I should stick to the mathematical calculation based on the given data.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2 boxes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
