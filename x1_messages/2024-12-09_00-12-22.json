        "content": "Let's see. So, we have a train that travels from Town A to Town B, which are 120 miles apart, and it takes 2 hours to do that. Now, we need to find out how long it would take the same train to travel 180 miles at the same speed.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out what the train's speed is. Since speed is distance divided by time, I can calculate it using the given distance and time.\n\nSo, speed = distance / time = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow that I know the train's speed is 60 mph, I can use that to find out how long it would take to travel 180 miles.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 180 miles / 60 mph = 3 hours.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to think about it?\n\nMaybe I can set up a proportion. If 120 miles takes 2 hours, then 180 miles would take x hours.\n\nSo, 120 miles / 2 hours = 180 miles / x hours.\n\nThat simplifies to 60 mph on the left side, so on the right side, it would be 180 / x = 60.\n\nThen, solving for x: 180 / 60 = x, which gives x = 3 hours.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio of the distances. Since 180 miles is 1.5 times 120 miles (because 180 / 120 = 1.5), the time should also be 1.5 times longer.\n\nGiven that the original time is 2 hours, multiplying by 1.5 gives 3 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 3 hours as the answer.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the train would take 3 hours to travel 180 miles at the same speed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
