        "content": "I'm here to help with your questions. However, I need to clarify some information in your statement. Albert Einstein was not a biologist; he was a theoretical physicist. He is best known for his theory of relativity and mass-energy equivalence, expressed by the famous equation E=mc\u00b2. Einstein did receive the Nobel Prize, but it was in Physics in 1921, not in Medicine, and it was awarded for his services to theoretical physics, particularly for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\n\nRegarding his mathematical abilities, contrary to the statement, Einstein was actually highly skilled in mathematics from a young age. He showed a remarkable aptitude for the subject and taught himself geometry at the age of 12. So, it's important to have accurate information about historical figures like Einstein to understand their contributions properly.\n\nENDINPUT"
