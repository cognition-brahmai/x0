        "content": "So there are 10 birds sitting on a power line, and a hunter shoots one of them. The question is, how many birds remain on the power line?\n\nAt first glance, it seems like a straightforward subtraction problem: 10 birds minus 1 bird that was shot equals 9 birds remaining. But let's think about it more carefully.\n\nWhen a hunter shoots one bird, it's likely that the sound of the gunshot would scare the remaining birds, causing them to fly away. So, even though only one bird was shot, the others might flee due to the noise.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that after the shot, no birds remain on the power line because they all flew away.\n\nBut maybe not all of them fly away. Perhaps some are braver or more accustomed to noises. However, it's generally safe to assume that a gunshot would startle them enough to make them fly off.\n\nSo, considering the noise of the shot, it's reasonable to think that all the remaining birds would fly away.\n\nThus, the answer might be that no birds remain on the power line after the shot.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"how many birds remain on the power line?\" not \"how many birds are left alive.\"\n\nThe shot bird could still be on the power line, dead or injured, while the others have flown away.\n\nSo, if all the other birds fly away, and only the shot bird remains on the power line, then the answer would be 1 bird remains on the power line.\n\nBut, if the shot bird is also startled and flies off or falls off the power line, then perhaps no birds remain.\n\nHowever, since the hunter shot one bird, it's likely that that bird is no longer able to fly, so it might stay on the power line unless it falls off due to the injury.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify whether the bird falls off or not.\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward answer is that after the shot, all the other birds fly away, and the shot bird remains on the power line, making it 1 bird remaining on the power line.\n\nBut, if the shot causes the bird to fall off the power line, then no birds remain.\n\nThe question is a bit tricky because it depends on assumptions about the birds' reactions and the outcome of the shot.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is 0, assuming that the shot bird also falls off or is removed from the power line.\n\nAlternatively, if the shot bird remains on the power line, then 1 bird remains.\n\nBut the question might be expecting the answer 0, assuming that the noise scares all the other birds away, and the shot bird is no longer able to stay on the power line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hunter misses, and no birds are hurt, so all 10 remain.\n\nBut the question says \"a hunter shoots one of them,\" which implies that the hunter hits one bird.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe the answer is 9, assuming that the shot bird is removed from the power line, and the others fly away.\n\nWait, no, that would be 0.\n\nWait, no, if 1 is shot and remains on the power line, and the other 9 fly away, then 1 remains.\n\nOr if the shot bird falls off or is removed, then 0 remain.\n\nBut the question is about how many birds remain on the power line, not how many are left alive.\n\nSo, even if the shot bird is still on the power line, dead, it's still a bird on the power line.\n\nBut perhaps the question assumes that only live birds stay on the power line.\n\nNo, the question doesn't specify that.\n\nSo, the shot bird could be on the power line, dead, while the others have flown away.\n\nThus, 1 bird remains on the power line.\n\nAlternatively, if the shot causes the bird to fall off the power line, then no birds remain.\n\nBut the question says \"a hunter shoots one of them,\" which implies that one bird is shot, but it doesn't specify whether the bird falls off or remains on the power line.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is 1 bird remains on the power line: the one that was shot.\n\nBut, realistically, a gunshot would scare the other birds away.\n\nSo, the answer is 1 bird remains on the power line.\n\nWait, but the question might be a trick question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 0, because the shot scares all the birds away, including the shot bird, which falls off.\n\nThus, no birds remain on the power line.\n\nBut, if the shot bird remains on the power line, dead, and the others fly away, then 1 remains.\n\nThe question is ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 9, but that doesn't make sense because if one is shot, and the others fly away, it's 0, or if the shot bird remains, it's 1.\n\nWait, no, if one is shot and remains, and the others fly away, it's 1.\n\nIf the shot bird falls off, it's 0.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1.\n\nThis is a bit confusing.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 0, assuming that all birds, including the shot one, are no longer on the power line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is 1 bird remains on the power line.\n\nBut considering the noise of the shot would scare the other birds away, and the shot bird is still there, unless it falls off.\n\nSo, perhaps 1 remains.\n\nBut if it falls off, then 0.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify, so maybe the answer is 0.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nI think I'll go with 0 birds remain on the power line.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
