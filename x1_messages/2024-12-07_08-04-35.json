        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 25 cars in total. On Monday, they rent out 60% of their cars. So first, I need to find out how many cars that is.\n\nTo find 60% of 25, I can calculate 0.60 times 25.\n\n0.60 \u00d7 25 = 15 cars.\n\nSo, they rented out 15 cars on Monday.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many cars they need to rent out on Tuesday to reach an 80% rental rate for the two days combined.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an 80% rental rate for two days means. I think it means that overall, over the two days, they want to have rented out 80% of their total cars.\n\nWait, but rental rates can be calculated in different ways. Maybe it's the total number of rentals over the two days divided by the total possible rentals, which would be 25 cars times 2 days, equaling 50 possible rentals.\n\nWait, but that might not make sense because they only have 25 cars. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the rental rate is based on the number of cars rented over the two days compared to the total number of cars available.\n\nSo, if they have 25 cars, and they want an 80% rental rate over two days, that would mean they want to rent out 80% of 25 cars over the two days.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n80% of 25 is 0.80 \u00d7 25 = 20 cars.\n\nSo, they want to rent out a total of 20 cars over Monday and Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, they already rented out 15 cars.\n\nSo, to reach a total of 20 cars, they need to rent out 20 - 15 = 5 cars on Tuesday.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"how many more cars do they need to rent out on Tuesday to reach an 80% rental rate for the two days combined?\"\n\nHmm, maybe the 80% is not about the total cars rented but about the average daily rental rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the total cars rented over the two days divided by the total possible rentals, which would be 25 cars rented each day, so 50 possible rentals.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because they only have 25 cars.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the total number of rentals over the two days divided by the total number of cars available.\n\nWait, but that still leads back to the same calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the average number of cars rented per day being 80% of the total cars.\n\nSo, 80% of 25 cars is 20 cars per day.\n\nBut that would mean they need to rent out 20 cars each day, which doesn't make sense because they only have 25 cars and they already rented out 15 on Monday.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of total rentals over the two days.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nTotal cars available: 25.\n\nRentals on Monday: 15 cars.\n\nLet\u2019s say rentals on Tuesday: x cars.\n\nTotal rentals over two days: 15 + x.\n\nThey want the total rentals over two days to be 80% of the total cars available.\n\nSo, 15 + x = 0.80 \u00d7 25.\n\n0.80 \u00d7 25 = 20.\n\nTherefore, 15 + x = 20.\n\nSo, x = 20 - 15 = 5.\n\nTherefore, they need to rent out 5 cars on Tuesday to reach an 80% rental rate for the two days combined.\n\nWait, but is there another way to interpret this?\n\nMaybe the rental rate is calculated differently, like the average rental rate per day.\n\nWait, if they rented 15 cars on Monday and x cars on Tuesday, the average rental per day would be (15 + x)/2.\n\nThey want this average to be 80% of the total cars, which is 20 cars.\n\nSo, (15 + x)/2 = 20.\n\nThen, 15 + x = 40.\n\nTherefore, x = 40 - 15 = 25.\n\nSo, they would need to rent out all 25 cars on Tuesday.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because they only have 25 cars.\n\nWait, but they already rented out 15 on Monday, so on Tuesday, they can only rent out up to 25 cars.\n\nBut according to this calculation, they would need to rent out 25 cars on Tuesday.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with the first approach.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf the rental rate is the average number of cars rented per day compared to the total number of cars, then the average rental per day should be 80% of the total cars.\n\nSo, average rental per day = (rentals on Monday + rentals on Tuesday)/2 = 0.80 \u00d7 total cars.\n\nSo, (15 + x)/2 = 0.80 \u00d7 25.\n\n0.80 \u00d7 25 = 20.\n\nSo, (15 + x)/2 = 20.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 15 + x = 40.\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides: x = 25.\n\nSo, they would need to rent out all 25 cars on Tuesday.\n\nBut that seems higher than the first approach.\n\nWait, maybe the rental rate is calculated differently.\n\nPerhaps it's the total number of cars rented over the two days divided by the total number of cars available.\n\nSo, total rentals over two days: 15 + x.\n\nTotal cars available: 25.\n\nThey want (15 + x)/25 = 0.80.\n\nSo, 15 + x = 0.80 \u00d7 25 = 20.\n\nTherefore, x = 20 - 15 = 5.\n\nSo, they need to rent out 5 cars on Tuesday.\n\nThis seems more reasonable.\n\nBut why does the average rental per day approach give a different answer?\n\nI think the confusion comes from how the rental rate is defined.\n\nIf the rental rate is the total rentals over the two days divided by the total number of cars, then x = 5.\n\nIf the rental rate is the average daily rentals divided by the total number of cars, then x = 25.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in context.\n\nProbably, the intended interpretation is the total rentals over the period divided by the total number of cars.\n\nTherefore, they need to rent out a total of 20 cars over two days.\n\nSince they already rented 15 on Monday, they need to rent 5 on Tuesday.\n\nSo, the answer is 5 cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
