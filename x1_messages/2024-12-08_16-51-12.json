        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here. One leaves from Station A at 9:00 AM going at 60 miles per hour, and another leaves from Station B at 10:00 AM going towards Station A at 90 miles per hour. Station B is 120 miles away from Station A.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out when they'll meet. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the combined speed is 60 + 90 = 150 miles per hour.\n\nBut wait, the second train leaves an hour later. So, in that one hour, the first train would have already covered some distance.\n\nFrom 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, the first train is moving at 60 mph for 1 hour, so it covers 60 miles.\n\nThat means, at 10:00 AM, when the second train starts, the distance between them is 120 - 60 = 60 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 150 mph. So, the time it takes for them to cover the remaining 60 miles is time = distance / speed = 60 / 150 = 0.4 hours.\n\nConvert 0.4 hours into minutes: 0.4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 24 minutes.\n\nTherefore, they will meet at 10:00 AM + 24 minutes = 10:24 AM.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up equations based on the time each train has been traveling.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time after 10:00 AM as t hours.\n\nSo, the first train has been traveling for (t + 1) hours by the time they meet, and the second train has been traveling for t hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the first train is 60*(t + 1) miles, and the distance covered by the second train is 90*t miles.\n\nSince the total distance between the stations is 120 miles, the sum of the distances should be 120 miles.\n\nSo, 60*(t + 1) + 90*t = 120.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for t:\n\n60t + 60 + 90t = 120\n\nCombine like terms: 150t + 60 = 120\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides: 150t = 60\n\nDivide both sides by 150: t = 60 / 150 = 0.4 hours, which is 24 minutes.\n\nSo, they meet at 10:24 AM.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is 60 + 90 = 150 mph.\n\nAt 10:00 AM, the distance between them is 60 miles (since the first train has already covered 60 miles by then).\n\nSo, time to meet is distance / relative speed = 60 / 150 = 0.4 hours, or 24 minutes.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10:24\\ \\text{AM}} \\]"
