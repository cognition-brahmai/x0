        "content": "I've heard that Alfred Nobel, the founder of the Nobel Prize, didn't include mathematics as a category because he believed that mathematics was a fundamental science that didn't have direct practical applications in the way that physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace did. However, this is just a theory, and the actual reason remains unknown since Nobel never explained his decision.\n\nAnother theory suggests that Nobel might have been jealous of a famous mathematician of his time, G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, with whom he may have had a personal conflict. But again, there's no concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Nobel Prizes were established to recognize achievements that confer the greatest benefit to humankind, and perhaps Nobel felt that mathematics, being more abstract, didn't fit this criterion as directly as the other fields he chose.\n\nDespite this, mathematics is recognized through other prestigious awards, such as the Fields Medal, which is often considered the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in mathematics."
