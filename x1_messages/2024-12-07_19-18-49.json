        "content": "So the farmer started with 15 sheep, and the statement says \"all but 8 died.\" So, I need to figure out how many sheep are left alive.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"all but 8 died\" means. It sounds like all the sheep died except for 8 of them. So, if all but 8 died, that means 8 sheep survived.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think carefully. The phrase \"all but 8\" could be interpreted in different ways. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider the total number of sheep initially: 15.\n\nIf \"all but 8 died,\" does that mean that 15 - 8 = 7 sheep died?\n\nBut no, that can't be right because if 7 died, then 8 are left, which aligns with the initial interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"all but 8\" means that only 8 died, and the rest survived.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the phrase says \"all but 8 died,\" which implies that all except 8 died.\n\nLet me look up the meaning of \"all but.\"\n\n\"all but\": omits, excludes\n\nSo, \"all but 8 died\" means that all except 8 died.\n\nTherefore, 8 sheep did not die; they are alive.\n\nSo, the number of sheep left alive is 8.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's more to this. Maybe there are other factors to consider.\n\nIs there any possibility that the farmer acquired more sheep or that some were sold or moved?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any other transactions, so I'll assume that the only change is the number that died.\n\nSo, starting with 15 sheep, and 8 survived, meaning 15 - 8 = 7 died.\n\nTherefore, the number left is 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phrase \"all but 8 died\" is ambiguous.\n\nLet me consider another perspective.\n\nSuppose \"all but 8 died\" means that all sheep died except for 8.\n\nIn that case, again, 8 are left alive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it means that all died, but 8 were excluded from dying, so those 8 are alive.\n\nEither way, it seems that 8 sheep are left alive.\n\nIs there a mathematical way to look at this?\n\nLet T be the total number of sheep, which is 15.\n\nLet D be the number that died.\n\nThe phrase says \"all but 8 died,\" so D = T - 8.\n\nTherefore, D = 15 - 8 = 7.\n\nSo, 7 died, and 15 - 7 = 8 are left.\n\nAlternatively, if \"all but 8 died,\" then the number left is 8.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nBut let's think outside the box.\n\nMaybe some sheep were injured but didn't die, or perhaps some new sheep were born.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I should stick to the information given.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the farmer had other animals, but again, the question is specifically about sheep.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the farmer had 15 sheep, and all but 8 died.\n\nTherefore, 8 sheep are left alive.\n\nI think that's the straightforward and correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
