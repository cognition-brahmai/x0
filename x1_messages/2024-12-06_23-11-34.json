        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence where each term is the sum of the three previous terms. The first three terms are given as 1, 2, and 4. I need to find the 6th term.\n\nSo, let's list out the terms I know:\n\n- Term 1: 1\n\n- Term 2: 2\n\n- Term 3: 4\n\nNow, each subsequent term is the sum of the three before it. So, to find term 4, I'll add terms 1, 2, and 3.\n\nTerm 4 = Term 1 + Term 2 + Term 3 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\nOkay, now for term 5, I'll add terms 2, 3, and 4.\n\nTerm 5 = Term 2 + Term 3 + Term 4 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13\n\nAnd finally, term 6 will be the sum of terms 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTerm 6 = Term 3 + Term 4 + Term 5 = 4 + 7 + 13 = 24\n\nSo, the 6th term should be 24.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should write down the sequence step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Term 1: 1\n\n- Term 2: 2\n\n- Term 3: 4\n\nThen:\n\n- Term 4: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\n- Term 5: 2 + 4 + 7 = 13\n\n- Term 6: 4 + 7 + 13 = 24\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about the general formula for such a sequence. If each term is the sum of the three preceding terms, this is similar to a tribonacci sequence, but starting with different initial terms.\n\nIn a standard tribonacci sequence, the first few terms are 0, 0, 1, and then each term is the sum of the three preceding ones. But in this case, the starting terms are 1, 2, 4.\n\nSo, to confirm, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. However, since the sequence is defined recursively, the straightforward way is to calculate each term step by step as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a recurrence relation:\n\nLet T(n) be the nth term of the sequence.\n\nThen:\n\nT(1) = 1\n\nT(2) = 2\n\nT(3) = 4\n\nT(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + T(n-3) for n > 3\n\nSo, to find T(6):\n\nFirst, T(4) = T(3) + T(2) + T(1) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7\n\nThen, T(5) = T(4) + T(3) + T(2) = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13\n\nFinally, T(6) = T(5) + T(4) + T(3) = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I can generalize this to find a formula for the nth term, but that might be complicated, especially since the sequence is defined recursively. For now, since I only need the 6th term, calculating step by step suffices.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for a closed-form expression using solving techniques for linear recurrence relations. The characteristic equation for the recurrence T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + T(n-3) would be:\n\nx^3 = x^2 + x + 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx^3 - x^2 - x - 1 = 0\n\nSolving this cubic equation would give the roots, which could then be used to form the general solution for T(n). However, this seems like overkill for just finding the 6th term, and it might be time-consuming to find the exact roots and solve for the constants using the initial conditions.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the recursive calculation seems more efficient.\n\nSo, confirming again:\n\n- T1 = 1\n\n- T2 = 2\n\n- T3 = 4\n\n- T4 = 7\n\n- T5 = 13\n\n- T6 = 24\n\nTherefore, the 6th term is 24.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me calculate one more term just to see the pattern.\n\nT7 = T6 + T5 + T4 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44\n\nYes, that seems to follow the same pattern. So, the sequence is:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, ...\n\nThis looks correct. Therefore, the 6th term is indeed 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
