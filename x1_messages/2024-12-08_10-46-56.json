        "content": "Before becoming a renowned physicist and developing the theory of relativity, Albert Einstein worked at a patent office in Bern, Switzerland. This period, from 1902 to 1909, was crucial for Einstein's scientific development, as he conducted much of his groundbreaking research during his spare time while employed there. His work at the patent office allowed him the freedom to think deeply about the problems that would later lead to his revolutionary theories, including the special theory of relativity."
