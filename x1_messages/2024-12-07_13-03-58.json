        "content": "Let's think this through step by step. So, we have four friends: Mike, Jane, Peter, and Olivia. The story goes like this:\n\n1. Mike sees Jane place her favorite book on a shelf near the entrance before she leaves for lunch.\n\n2. While Jane is away, Peter finds the book and moves it to a table at the back of the library.\n\n3. Later, Olivia finds the book at the back table and returns it to its original spot near the entrance.\n\nNow, the question is: Where does Mike think Jane's book is when she returns from lunch?\n\nOkay, so Mike witnessed Jane placing the book on a shelf near the entrance. He saw her do it, so he knows that's where it was when she left. After that, Peter moved it to the back table, but Mike didn't see that happen because he wasn't there at the time. Then, Olivia moved it back to the entrance shelf, but again, Mike didn't see that happen.\n\nSince Mike only saw Jane put the book on the entrance shelf and hasn't seen any changes to its location, he would probably think that the book is still where Jane left it, which is on the shelf near the entrance.\n\nIt doesn't matter that Peter moved it and Olivia moved it back; Mike wasn't aware of those actions. Unless someone tells him otherwise or he sees the book in a different place, he would assume it's still where he last saw it.\n\nSo, when Jane returns from lunch, Mike would think the book is on the shelf near the entrance.\n\nBut, just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other information that might affect Mike's perception.\n\n- Did Mike see Peter move the book? No.\n\n- Did Mike see Olivia move the book back? No.\n\n- Did anyone tell Mike about the book being moved? There's no mention of that.\n\n- Did Mike check the book's location while Jane was away? There's no indication that he did.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, Mike would still think the book is on the shelf near the entrance when Jane returns from lunch.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{on the shelf near the entrance}} \\]"
