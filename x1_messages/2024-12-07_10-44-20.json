We need to find out his overall profit or loss from these transactions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening step by step.\n\n1. He buys a shirt for $60.\n\n2. He sells that shirt for $80.\n\nSo, from the first transaction, he bought something for $60 and sold it for $80. That means he made a profit of $80 - $60 = $20 on the first shirt.\n\nNow, with that $80 from the sale, he buys another shirt for $80.\n\n3. He buys another shirt for $80.\n\n4. He sells this second shirt for $100.\n\nSo, from the second transaction, he bought something for $80 and sold it for $100, which means he made a profit of $100 - $80 = $20 on the second shirt.\n\nNow, to find the overall profit, I need to add up all his profits from each transaction.\n\nProfit from first shirt: $20\n\nProfit from second shirt: $20\n\nTotal profit: $20 + $20 = $40\n\nWait, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the total amount he spent and the total amount he earned.\n\nTotal spent:\n\nFirst purchase: $60\n\nSecond purchase: $80\n\nTotal spent = $60 + $80 = $140\n\nTotal earned:\n\nFirst sale: $80\n\nSecond sale: $100\n\nTotal earned = $80 + $100 = $180\n\nNow, overall profit is total earned minus total spent: $180 - $140 = $40\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, his overall profit is $40.\n\nBut let's think about it another way. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nSuppose he starts with a certain amount of money, say $x.\n\nHe spends $60 on the first shirt, so he has x - 60 left.\n\nThen he sells it for $80, so now he has (x - 60) + 80 = x + 20.\n\nThen he buys another shirt for $80, so he has x + 20 - 80 = x - 60.\n\nThen he sells that for $100, so he has (x - 60) + 100 = x + 40.\n\nSo, starting with x, he ends up with x + 40, meaning he made a profit of $40.\n\nAlright, this confirms the previous calculations.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the profit from each transaction separately.\n\nFirst transaction: buy for $60, sell for $80, profit = $20\n\nSecond transaction: buy for $80, sell for $100, profit = $20\n\nTotal profit: $20 + $20 = $40\n\nOr, as I did earlier, consider total spent and total earned.\n\nTotal spent: $60 + $80 = $140\n\nTotal earned: $80 + $100 = $180\n\nProfit: $180 - $140 = $40\n\nEverything points to $40 overall profit.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this?\n\nWait, maybe someone might think that the second purchase is being financed by the first sale, so the money flows differently, but in terms of overall profit, it should still be the same.\n\nAlternatively, if we look at it in terms of percentage profit per transaction, but the question is about overall profit in dollars, not percentages.\n\nSo, unless specified otherwise, we can stick with the dollar amount.\n\nTherefore, the man made an overall profit of $40 from these transactions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
