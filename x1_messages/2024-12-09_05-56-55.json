        "content": "So there are 5 people in a room, and each one shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think about person A. Person A shakes hands with persons B, C, D, and E. So that's 4 handshakes for person A.\n\nNext, person B has already shaken hands with person A, so person B only needs to shake hands with persons C, D, and E. That's 3 additional handshakes.\n\nThen, person C has already shaken hands with persons A and B, so person C only shakes hands with persons D and E. That's 2 more handshakes.\n\nPerson D has already shaken hands with persons A, B, and C, so person D only shakes hands with person E. That's 1 more handshake.\n\nFinally, person E has already shaken hands with everyone else, so no new handshakes there.\n\nNow, if I add up all these handshakes: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without listing everyone out? Maybe using some formula?\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items from n items is given by the combination formula: C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, n is 5 (the number of people), and we're choosing pairs of people to shake hands.\n\nSo, C(5, 2) = 5*4/2 = 10.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by listing them out.\n\nIs there another way to think about it? Maybe using graphs? I know that in graph theory, each person can be represented as a node, and each handshake as an edge connecting two nodes.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be equal to the number of edges in a complete graph with 5 nodes.\n\nAnd the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n nodes is again C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, again, C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nLet me try this with a smaller number to verify. Suppose there are 3 people: A, B, and C.\n\nEach shakes hands with the other two: A shakes with B and C, B shakes with C (since shaking hands with A already happened).\n\nTotal handshakes: 3.\n\nUsing the formula: C(3, 2) = 3*2/2 = 3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 4 people.\n\nHandshakes: A with B, C, D; B with C, D; C with D. Total: 6.\n\nFormula: C(4, 2) = 4*3/2 = 6. Correct.\n\nSo, for 5 people: C(5, 2) = 10. Seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as each person shaking hands with every other person, so initially, it seems like 5 people each shaking hands with 4 others, totaling 5*4=20 handshakes.\n\nBut that counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so I need to divide by 2 to correct for that, which gives 20/2=10.\n\nThat's another way to arrive at the same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the total number of handshakes is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
