        "content": "So there are 5 cats in a room, and each cat catches 4 mice. If there are no more mice left in the room, how many legs are there in total?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, we have 5 cats. Cats have 4 legs each, right? So, the total number of legs from the cats would be 5 cats times 4 legs per cat, which is 20 legs.\n\nNow, each cat catches 4 mice. So, 5 cats catching 4 mice each would mean 5 times 4, which is 20 mice. But the problem says that there are no more mice left in the room. That probably means all the mice have been caught by the cats and are no longer in the room.\n\nSo, if the mice are no longer in the room, their legs don't count towards the total number of legs in the room. Therefore, only the cats' legs are to be considered.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe the mice are still in the room, just caught by the cats. Maybe the mice are still present but held by the cats. The problem says \"each cat catches 4 mice\" and \"there are no more mice left in the room.\" So, if the mice are caught, are they considered to be in the room or not?\n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. If the mice are caught by the cats, but still in the room because they're being held by the cats, then their legs should still be counted. On the other hand, if catching them means they're removed from the room entirely, then their legs shouldn't be counted.\n\nGiven that the problem specifies \"there are no more mice left in the room,\" it seems like the mice are no longer present after being caught. So, their legs don't contribute to the total number of legs in the room.\n\nTherefore, only the cats' legs should be considered. Since each cat has 4 legs, and there are 5 cats, the total number of legs in the room is 5 times 4, which equals 20 legs.\n\nBut let's think about this again. Do cats have legs or paws? Well, cats have paws, which are considered legs. So, 4 paws per cat, totaling 20 paws, which are legs.\n\nIs there any other interpretation? Maybe considering that the mice are still in the room, even if they're caught. But the problem says \"there are no more mice left in the room,\" which suggests that after being caught, they're no longer in the room.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 20 legs in the room, all belonging to the cats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
