        "content": "Let's see here. We have two trains, both traveling at the same speed. The first train goes from City A to City B in 6 hours, and the second train goes from City B to City C in 8 hours. The question is asking which distance is longer: from City A to City B or from City B to City C.\n\nOkay, so since both trains are traveling at the same speed, that's a key point. Let's denote the speed of both trains as S (let's say in miles per hour for simplicity).\n\nThe formula to remember here is that distance equals speed multiplied by time, right? So, Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time.\n\nSo, for the first train from City A to City B:\n\nDistance AB = S \u00d7 6 hours.\n\nAnd for the second train from City B to City C:\n\nDistance BC = S \u00d7 8 hours.\n\nNow, since both speeds are the same, and the times are different, it's straightforward to compare the distances.\n\nGiven that 8 hours is greater than 6 hours, and since speed is constant, Distance BC must be longer than Distance AB.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. If both trains are going at the same speed, but one is traveling for a longer time, it must cover a greater distance.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the distance from City B to City C, which takes 8 hours, is longer than the distance from City A to City B, which takes only 6 hours.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if speed could be different in some way. The problem clearly states that both trains travel at the same speed, so I don't need to worry about different speeds.\n\nAlso, perhaps there could be some trick involving the directions or something, but the question is pretty straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's something about the cities being connected in a certain way, but again, the question seems to present a simple scenario.\n\nSo, in conclusion, since both trains have the same speed and one travels for a longer time, the distance covered in that longer time must be greater.\n\nTherefore, the distance from City B to City C is longer than from City A to City B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{City B to City C}} \\]"
