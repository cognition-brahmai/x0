I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a singly linked list is. It's a linear data structure where each element points to the next one, forming a sequence. Each element is called a node, and it contains some data and a reference to the next node.\n\nWe'll need two classes:\n\n1. **Node**: This class will represent each element in the list. It will have:\n   - A data field to store the value.\n   - A reference to the next node.\n\n2. **LinkedList**: This class will manage the list operations. It will have:\n   - A reference to the head of the list.\n   - Methods to add, remove, and find elements by value.\n\nLet's start by defining the Node class.\n\n## Step 1: Define the Node Class\n\nThe Node class is straightforward. It has two components:\n\n- Data: This can be of any type, but for simplicity, let's use integers.\n- Next: A reference to the next node in the list.\n\nHere's how you can define it:\n\n```java\nclass Node {\n    int data;\n    Node next;\n\n    public Node(int data) {\n        this.data = data;\n        this.next = null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 2: Define the LinkedList Class\n\nNow, we'll create the LinkedList class that will use the Node class to create and manage the list.\n\n### 2.1 Constructor\n\nInitialize the head of the list to null.\n\n```java\npublic class LinkedList {\n    Node head;\n\n    public LinkedList() {\n        this.head = null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.2 Method to Add an Element\n\nWe'll create a method to add an element to the end of the list.\n\n```java\npublic void add(int data) {\n    Node newNode = new Node(data);\n    if (head == null) {\n        head = newNode;\n    } else {\n        Node current = head;\n        while (current.next != null) {\n            current = current.next;\n        }\n        current.next = newNode;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.3 Method to Remove an Element by Value\n\nWe'll create a method to remove the first occurrence of a node with a specific value.\n\n```java\npublic void remove(int data) {\n    if (head == null) return;\n\n    if (head.data == data) {\n        head = head.next;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    Node current = head;\n    while (current.next != null) {\n        if (current.next.data == data) {\n            current.next = current.next.next;\n            return;\n        }\n        current = current.next;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.4 Method to Find an Element by Value\n\nWe'll create a method to check if a value exists in the list.\n\n```java\npublic boolean contains(int data) {\n    Node current = head;\n    while (current != null) {\n        if (current.data == data) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        current = current.next;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Testing the LinkedList Class\n\nTo ensure our LinkedList class works correctly, let's write a simple test.\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        LinkedList list = new LinkedList();\n        list.add(1);\n        list.add(2);\n        list.add(3);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Contains 2: \" + list.contains(2)); // Should print true\n        list.remove(2);\n        System.out.println(\"Contains 2 after removal: \" + list.contains(2)); // Should print false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Node Class**:\n   - Holds integer data and a reference to the next node.\n   \n2. **LinkedList Class**:\n   - **add(int data)**: Adds a new node with the given data to the end of the list.\n   - **remove(int data)**: Removes the first node that matches the given data.\n   - **contains(int data)**: Checks if the list contains a node with the given data.\n\nThis should give you a basic singly linked list implementation in Java.
