        "content": "So there are 5 barbers in this town, and each one cuts the hair of every other barber but not their own. So, if there are 5 barbers, and each doesn't cut their own hair, that means each barber gives haircuts to the other 4 barbers. Wait, but the question says each barber cuts the hair of every other barber except themselves. So, does that mean each barber gives 4 haircuts?\n\nLet me think about this differently. If there are 5 barbers, and each one doesn't cut their own hair, then each one must get their hair cut by one of the other barbers. But the question is asking how many haircuts each barber gives, not how many they receive.\n\nSo, if each barber cuts the hair of every other barber, that would mean each barber gives 4 haircuts, one to each of the other barbers. But wait, is that possible? If every barber is giving 4 haircuts, then the total number of haircuts given would be 5 barbers times 4 haircuts each, which is 20 haircuts. But in reality, since each haircut involves one barber cutting another's hair, the total number of unique haircuts should be fewer.\n\nLet me consider it as a combination problem. If there are 5 barbers, and each one cuts the hair of every other barber except themselves, it's like finding the number of ordered pairs where one barber is cutting another's hair, excluding the cases where a barber cuts their own hair.\n\nSo, in total, there are 5 barbers, and each can cut the hair of 4 others. So, 5 times 4 is 20, but since each haircut is a unique interaction between two barbers, perhaps I need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. Wait, but in this scenario, each haircut is a directed action from one barber to another, so it's not necessarily a two-way street. Barber A cutting Barber B's hair is different from Barber B cutting Barber A's hair.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about it differently. If each barber cuts the hair of every other barber except themselves, then indeed, each barber gives 4 haircuts. And each barber receives 4 haircuts, because there are 4 other barbers who cut their hair.\n\nBut let's check this with a smaller number to see if it makes sense. Suppose there are only 2 barbers, A and B. Each doesn't cut their own hair, so A cuts B's hair, and B cuts A's hair. So each gives 1 haircut. Similarly, with 3 barbers, A, B, and C. A cuts B and C's hair, B cuts A and C's hair, and C cuts A and B's hair. So each gives 2 haircuts.\n\nFollowing this pattern, with 5 barbers, each should give 4 haircuts.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that some barbers cut each other's hair? Like, barber A cuts barber B's hair, and barber B cuts barber A's hair. In that case, each is giving one haircut to the other.\n\nBut according to the problem, each barber cuts the hair of every other barber, which suggests that it's a mutual arrangement where they cut each other's hair.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for how many haircuts each barber gives, not receives.\n\nSo, if each barber cuts the hair of every other barber except themselves, and there are 5 barbers, then each gives 4 haircuts.\n\nBut let's think about the total number of haircuts. If there are 5 barbers, and each gives 4 haircuts, that's 20 haircuts in total. But in reality, since each haircut is between two barbers, perhaps there's some overcounting here.\n\nWait, no. In this scenario, each haircut is a unique event where one barber is cutting another's hair. So, if barber A cuts barber B's hair, that's one haircut, and separately, barber B cuts barber A's hair, that's another haircut.\n\nSo, in that case, with 5 barbers, each giving 4 haircuts, totaling 20 haircuts, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as the number of ordered pairs of barbers where the first barber cuts the second barber's hair, excluding the cases where a barber cuts their own hair.\n\nSo, total ordered pairs are 5 choices for the first barber and 4 choices for the second barber (excluding themselves), totaling 20.\n\nTherefore, each barber gives 4 haircuts.\n\nWait, but there might be a different interpretation. Maybe the problem implies that the haircuts are mutual, meaning that if A cuts B's hair, then B cuts A's hair, making it a mutual agreement.\n\nIn that case, the number of unique pairs would be the number of ways to choose 2 barbers out of 5, which is combinations of 5 choose 2, which is 10.\n\nAnd in each pair, they cut each other's hair, so each pair results in 2 haircuts.\n\nTherefore, total haircuts would be 10 pairs times 2 haircuts per pair, which is 20 haircuts, consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nBut the question is how many haircuts each barber gives.\n\nIn this mutual arrangement, each barber is part of 4 pairs (since there are 5 barbers in total), but wait, no.\n\nWait, in 5 barbers, the number of unique pairs is 10, as calculated.\n\nBut each barber is involved in 4 pairs, since there are 4 other barbers.\n\nSo, if each pair involves 2 haircuts, then each barber is involved in 4 pairs, giving 4 haircuts.\n\nAgain, this leads to each barber giving 4 haircuts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is suggesting that the barbers form a cycle, where each barber cuts the hair of the next barber in the cycle.\n\nFor example, A cuts B's hair, B cuts C's hair, C cuts D's hair, D cuts E's hair, and E cuts A's hair.\n\nIn this case, each barber gives one haircut and receives one haircut.\n\nBut according to the problem, each barber cuts the hair of every other barber except themselves, which seems more extensive than just a single haircut per barber.\n\nWait, no, in the cycle example, each barber is only cutting one other barber's hair, but the problem says each barber cuts the hair of every other barber except themselves.\n\nSo the cycle example doesn't fit the problem's description.\n\nTherefore, the initial interpretation is correct: each barber cuts the hair of every other barber except themselves, meaning each gives 4 haircuts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Each barber cuts the hair of every other barber in town except for themselves.\"\n\nSo, each barber cuts the hair of the other 4 barbers.\n\nTherefore, each gives 4 haircuts.\n\nHence, the answer is that each barber gives 4 haircuts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
