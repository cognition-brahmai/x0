        "content": "So the garden is currently rectangular, with a length of 25 meters and a width of 10 meters. The owner wants to increase the area by 50% but only by making the garden longer, not wider. I need to find out what the new length should be to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the current area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width, right? So, current area = length \u00d7 width = 25 meters \u00d7 10 meters = 250 square meters.\n\nNow, the owner wants to increase this area by 50%. So, the new area should be the current area plus 50% of it. That means new area = 250 square meters + (0.5 \u00d7 250 square meters) = 250 + 125 = 375 square meters.\n\nThe width remains the same, at 10 meters, and only the length is increased. Let's call the new length \"L\" meters. The new area should be L \u00d7 10 = 375 square meters.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: L \u00d7 10 = 375.\n\nTo find L, I just need to divide both sides of the equation by 10: L = 375 / 10 = 37.5 meters.\n\nTherefore, the new length should be 37.5 meters.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If the original area is 250 square meters and the new area is 375 square meters, that is indeed a 50% increase because 375 - 250 = 125, and 125 is 50% of 250.\n\nAlso, if the width stays at 10 meters, and the new length is 37.5 meters, then the new area is indeed 37.5 \u00d7 10 = 375 square meters.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37.5 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
