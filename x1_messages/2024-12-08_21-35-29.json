        "content": "The primary focus of cognitive load theory in educational psychology is option E: It focuses on the capacity of working memory during learning and problem-solving.\n\nCognitive load theory was developed by John Sweller in the 1980s and has since become an important framework for understanding how information is processed and learned. The theory emphasizes that human working memory has a limited capacity and that instructional designs should take this into account to optimize learning.\n\nThere are several key concepts within cognitive load theory:\n\n1. **Intrinsic Cognitive Load**: This refers to the inherent difficulty of the material being learned. Some topics are naturally more complex and require more cognitive effort to understand.\n\n2. **Extraneous Cognitive Load**: This is the load imposed by the way information is presented or the manner in which instruction is designed. Poorly designed instructional materials can increase this load, making learning more difficult.\n\n3. **Germane Cognitive Load**: This is the cognitive load associated with the construction of schemas or the automation of processes. It's the part of the working memory capacity that is dedicated to learning.\n\nThe goal of instructional design, according to cognitive load theory, is to reduce extraneous cognitive load and manage intrinsic cognitive load so that more working memory capacity is available for germane cognitive load, thereby enhancing learning.\n\nThis theory has significant implications for teaching methods, multimedia design, and the development of educational materials. It suggests that by structuring information in a way that aligns with how the brain processes information, educators can make learning more efficient and effective.\n\nWhile options A, B, C, and D touch on important aspects of educational psychology, they do not specifically capture the core focus of cognitive load theory, which is centered on the capacity and functioning of working memory during learning and problem-solving tasks."
