Now, for every kitten, there are 2 mice, so 12 kittens times 2 mice each would be 24 mice.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many legs each type of animal has:\n\n- Cats have 4 legs each.\n\n- Kitten's are young cats, so they also have 4 legs each.\n\n- Mice, I think, also have 4 legs each.\n\nSo, total legs would be:\n\n- Cats: 4 cats times 4 legs = 16 legs.\n\n- Kittens: 12 kittens times 4 legs = 48 legs.\n\n- Mice: 24 mice times 4 legs = 96 legs.\n\nNow, adding them all up: 16 + 48 + 96.\n\nLet's add 16 and 48 first: that's 64.\n\nThen, 64 plus 96: that should be 160.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that mice are rodents and they have 4 legs, so that seems right.\n\nBut let's double-check:\n\n- Cats: 4 cats * 4 legs = 16 legs.\n\n- Kittens: 12 kittens * 4 legs = 48 legs.\n\n- Mice: 24 mice * 4 legs = 96 legs.\n\nTotal: 16 + 48 + 96 = 160 legs.\n\nHmm, but is there anything else in the room that has legs? Like, perhaps the room has chairs or tables, but the question doesn't mention any other objects, so maybe it's just the animals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the room has a certain number of legs, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the room is a rectangular room, and rooms don't have legs unless they are like portable rooms or something, but that's probably not the case here.\n\nSo, I think the total number of legs is just from the animals.\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs in the room is 160.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
