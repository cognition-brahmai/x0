        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 50 widgets per hour, and each widget has a 10% chance of being defective. There are 8 working hours in a day. I need to find out the expected number of non-defective widgets produced in one day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total number of widgets produced in a day. Since the factory produces 50 widgets per hour and works for 8 hours, the total production per day would be:\n\nTotal widgets per day = 50 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 400 widgets\n\nNow, each widget has a 10% chance of being defective. That means the probability of a widget being defective is 10%, or 0.10. Therefore, the probability of a widget being non-defective is:\n\nProbability of non-defective = 1 - probability of defective = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90\n\nTo find the expected number of non-defective widgets, I can multiply the total number of widgets by the probability of being non-defective:\n\nExpected non-defective widgets = Total widgets per day * Probability of non-defective = 400 * 0.90 = 360\n\nSo, the expected number of non-defective widgets produced in one day is 360.\n\nBut let me double-check this. I recall that expected value is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing these up. In this case, each widget can be either defective or non-defective, with probabilities 0.10 and 0.90, respectively.\n\nSo, for each widget, the expected number of non-defective ones is 1 * 0.90 + 0 * 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nSince there are 400 widgets produced in a day, the total expected number of non-defective widgets would indeed be 400 * 0.90 = 360.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of binomial distribution. If each widget is an independent trial with a success probability of 0.90 (non-defective), then the expected number of successes (non-defective widgets) in 400 trials is simply n * p = 400 * 0.90 = 360.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe considering the defective widgets and subtracting them from the total.\n\nIf the probability of a widget being defective is 0.10, then the expected number of defective widgets per day is:\n\nExpected defective widgets = Total widgets per day * Probability of defective = 400 * 0.10 = 40\n\nTherefore, the expected number of non-defective widgets would be:\n\nTotal widgets per day - Expected defective widgets = 400 - 40 = 360\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nI think I've approached this from a few different angles, and all methods lead to the same answer: 360 non-defective widgets expected per day.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, does the inspection process affect the number of defective widgets? The question says that each widget is inspected and has a 10% chance of being defective, but it doesn't mention that defective widgets are removed or handled differently after inspection. So, I'm assuming that all widgets, whether defective or not, are counted in the total production.\n\nAlso, the production rate is constant at 50 widgets per hour, and the probability of being defective is independent for each widget. There doesn't seem to be any dependency between widgets or variation in the production process throughout the day.\n\nGiven that, my calculation should hold.\n\nOne more thing: since the number of widgets is large (400), and the probability of defect is small (0.10), the distribution of non-defective widgets should be approximately normal, but since the question is only asking for the expected value, I don't need to delve into the distribution itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the expected number of non-defective widgets produced in one day is 360.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
