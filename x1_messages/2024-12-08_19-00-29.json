        "content": "So I've got this problem here about calculating potential revenue from ticket sales at a new stadium. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the stadium has a seating capacity of 60,000 spectators. There are three types of tickets: general admission, premium seats, and VIP boxes. The percentages are given as 80% for general admission, 15% for premium seats, and 5% for VIP boxes. The prices are $50 for general admission, $100 for premium seats, and $500 for VIP boxes.\n\nOkay, so to find the potential revenue, I need to calculate how many seats there are of each type and then multiply by their respective prices. Finally, I'll add them all up to get the total revenue for a sold-out event.\n\nLet's start by finding out how many seats there are for each type.\n\nGeneral admission seats:\n\n80% of 60,000 = 0.80 * 60,000 = 48,000 seats\n\nPremium seats:\n\n15% of 60,000 = 0.15 * 60,000 = 9,000 seats\n\nVIP boxes:\n\n5% of 60,000 = 0.05 * 60,000 = 3,000 seats\n\nNow, I'll calculate the revenue from each type.\n\nGeneral admission revenue:\n\n48,000 seats * $50 per seat = $2,400,000\n\nPremium seats revenue:\n\n9,000 seats * $100 per seat = $900,000\n\nVIP boxes revenue:\n\n3,000 seats * $500 per seat = $1,500,000\n\nFinally, I'll add these amounts to get the total potential revenue.\n\nTotal revenue = General + Premium + VIP\n\n$2,400,000 + $900,000 + $1,500,000 = $4,800,000\n\nSo, the potential revenue from a sold-out event is $4,800,000.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the seat calculations:\n\nGeneral: 80% of 60,000 is indeed 48,000.\n\nPremium: 15% of 60,000 is 9,000.\n\nVIP: 5% of 60,000 is 3,000.\n\nThat adds up to 48,000 + 9,000 + 3,000 = 60,000, which matches the total capacity. Good.\n\nNow, the revenue calculations:\n\nGeneral: 48,000 * $50 = $2,400,000\n\nPremium: 9,000 * $100 = $900,000\n\nVIP: 3,000 * $500 = $1,500,000\n\nAdding those up: $2,400,000 + $900,000 = $3,300,000; then $3,300,000 + $1,500,000 = $4,800,000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it using the percentages and prices directly.\n\nTotal revenue = (0.80 * 60,000 * $50) + (0.15 * 60,000 * $100) + (0.05 * 60,000 * $500)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n(48,000 * $50) + (9,000 * $100) + (3,000 * $500) = $2,400,000 + $900,000 + $1,500,000 = $4,800,000\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of average revenue per seat.\n\nFirst, find the weighted average price per seat.\n\nAverage price = (0.80 * $50) + (0.15 * $100) + (0.05 * $500)\n\n= ($40) + ($15) + ($25) = $80\n\nThen, total revenue would be average price times total seats: $80 * 60,000 = $4,800,000\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I end up with $4,800,000 as the potential revenue for a sold-out event.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4800000} \\]"
