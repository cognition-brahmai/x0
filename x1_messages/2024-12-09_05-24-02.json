        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $2.50 per pound and oranges for $3.00 per pound. I need to find out how much it would cost to buy 4 pounds of apples and 6 pounds of oranges.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of the apples. Apples are $2.50 per pound, and I'm buying 4 pounds. So, I multiply 2.50 by 4.\n\n2.50 \u00d7 4 = 10.00\n\nSo, the apples will cost $10.00.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost of the oranges. Oranges are $3.00 per pound, and I'm buying 6 pounds. So, I multiply 3.00 by 6.\n\n3.00 \u00d7 6 = 18.00\n\nSo, the oranges will cost $18.00.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges together.\n\n10.00 + 18.00 = 28.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy 4 pounds of apples and 6 pounds of oranges is $28.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28.00} \\]"
