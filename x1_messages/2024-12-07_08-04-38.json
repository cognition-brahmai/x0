        "content": "I think the animal you're referring to is the Giraffe. Giraffes are known for their long necks and spotted coats, and they do have a relatively long gestation period compared to many other mammals. The gestation period for giraffes is approximately 15 months, which is one of the longest among land mammals. After this extended period, a mother giraffe gives birth to a calf that can stand up and walk within hours of birth, which is quite remarkable."
