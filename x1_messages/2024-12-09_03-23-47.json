        "content": "Let's see what's going on here. Emily puts 10 chocolate chips on the counter and then goes to the bathroom. While she's away, Sarah adds 5 more chocolate chips to the pile. So, initially, there are 10 chips, and Sarah adds 5, which should make it 15 chips in total.\n\nBut then their brother Tom comes by and takes 3 chips without anyone noticing. So, from those 15, he takes 3, which should leave 12 chips on the counter.\n\nNow, when Emily comes back, she probably doesn't know that Sarah added more chips or that Tom took some. So, she probably still thinks there are only the original 10 chips she placed there.\n\nTherefore, Emily expects to find 10 chocolate chips on the counter, but in reality, there are 12 chips there.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nEmily places 10 chips.\n\nSarah adds 5, so now there are 15.\n\nTom takes 3, leaving 12.\n\nSo, yes, actually on the counter there are 12 chips.\n\nBut what does Emily expect? She only knows she put 10 chips there. She doesn't know about Sarah adding more or Tom taking some.\n\nSo, she expects 10, but there are actually 12.\n\nUnless... maybe Emily knows that Sarah sometimes adds chips, but in the story, it doesn't say that Emily is aware of Sarah's action.\n\nSimilarly, Emily doesn't know that Tom took some.\n\nSo, her expectation is based on what she did initially, which is placing 10 chips.\n\nTherefore, she expects 10, but finds 12.\n\nWait, but Tom took 3, so if there were 15 and he took 3, it's 12.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is: Emily expects to find 10 chocolate chips, but there are actually 12 on the counter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ expected}, 12 \\text{ actual}} \\]"
