        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store selling apples and oranges. Apples are $0.50 each, and oranges are $0.75 each. A customer buys a total of 8 fruits for $4.50, and we need to find out how many apples they bought.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of apples.\n\n- Let \\( o \\) be the number of oranges.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of fruits is 8.\n\n2. The total cost is $4.50.\n\nSo, we can set up two equations based on this information.\n\nThe first equation is about the total number of fruits:\n\n\\[ a + o = 8 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total cost:\n\n\\[ 0.50a + 0.75o = 4.50 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( o \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by substitution. Let\u2019s solve the first equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 8 - o \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 0.50(8 - o) + 0.75o = 4.50 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify this:\n\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 8 - 0.50o + 0.75o = 4.50 \\]\n\n\\[ 4 - 0.50o + 0.75o = 4.50 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 4 + ( -0.50o + 0.75o ) = 4.50 \\]\n\n\\[ 4 + 0.25o = 4.50 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.25o = 0.50 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 0.25:\n\n\\[ o = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the number of oranges is 2.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation \\( a = 8 - o \\):\n\n\\[ a = 8 - 2 \\]\n\n\\[ a = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 6 apples.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf they bought 6 apples at $0.50 each, that\u2019s:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 0.50 = 3.00 \\]\n\nPlus 2 oranges at $0.75 each:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.75 = 1.50 \\]\n\nTotal cost:\n\n\\[ 3.00 + 1.50 = 4.50 \\]\n\nThat matches the total cost given. Also, the total number of fruits is 6 apples + 2 oranges = 8 fruits, which also matches.\n\nSo, the answer is indeed 6 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
