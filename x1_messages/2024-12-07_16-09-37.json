        "content": "So the office uses 20 packs of paper every week, and each pack has 500 sheets. I need to find out how many sheets that is in a whole year. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many sheets are used each week. Since there are 20 packs and each pack has 500 sheets, I can multiply 20 by 500 to get the weekly usage.\n\n20 packs/week * 500 sheets/pack = 10,000 sheets/week\n\nOkay, so the office uses 10,000 sheets every week.\n\nNow, to find out the annual usage, I need to know how many weeks there are in a year. Typically, there are 52 weeks in a year.\n\nSo, if they use 10,000 sheets per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, I can multiply those two numbers to get the total sheets used in a year.\n\n10,000 sheets/week * 52 weeks/year = 520,000 sheets/year\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there might be more to this. Maybe consider things like leap years or holidays, but since it's a standard year, I think 52 weeks is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, some people might consider a year to have 52 weeks and one extra day, but for the purpose of this calculation, I think 52 weeks is accurate enough.\n\nSo, the office uses 520,000 sheets of paper in a year.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's verify the calculations again.\n\n20 packs/week * 500 sheets/pack = 10,000 sheets/week\n\n10,000 sheets/week * 52 weeks/year = 520,000 sheets/year\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI could also approach this differently, maybe by calculating the number of packs used in a year and then multiplying by the sheets per pack.\n\nSo, 20 packs/week * 52 weeks/year = 1,040 packs/year\n\nThen, 1,040 packs/year * 500 sheets/pack = 520,000 sheets/year\n\nSame result. Good, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the annual usage in packs first and then convert to sheets, but as shown, it leads to the same total.\n\nI think 520,000 sheets per year is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{520000} \\]"
