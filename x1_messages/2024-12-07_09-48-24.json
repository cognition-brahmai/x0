        "content": "So in this class, there are 40 students in total. Out of these, 60% got an A grade, and the remaining students got a B grade. The question is asking how many more students received an A compared to those who received a B.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many students got an A. Since 60% of the class got an A, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 40.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 40, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply by the total number of students.\n\n60% as a decimal is 0.60.\n\nSo, 0.60 times 40 is:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 40 = 24\n\nSo, 24 students received an A grade.\n\nNow, to find out how many students received a B grade, I can subtract the number of students who got an A from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nStudents with A = 24\n\nStudents with B = Total students - Students with A\n\nStudents with B = 40 - 24 = 16\n\nSo, 16 students received a B grade.\n\nThe question is asking how many more students received an A than a B. To find this, I need to subtract the number of students who got a B from the number of students who got an A.\n\nMore students with A than B = Students with A - Students with B\n\nMore students with A than B = 24 - 16 = 8\n\nTherefore, 8 more students received an A grade than a B grade.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
