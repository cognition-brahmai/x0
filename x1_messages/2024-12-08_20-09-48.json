        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. There are two candidates, A and B, in an election. Candidate A received 55% of the total votes cast, and candidate B received 35%. There are 12,000 eligible voters, and 90% of them voted. I need to find out how many more votes candidate A received than candidate B.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to find out how many people actually voted. There were 12,000 eligible voters, and 90% of them voted. So, the number of people who voted is 90% of 12,000. Let me calculate that:\n\n90% of 12,000 is 0.9 * 12,000 = 10,800 votes were cast in total.\n\nNow, candidate A received 55% of these votes, and candidate B received 35%. I need to find out how many votes each candidate got.\n\nFirst, candidate A's votes:\n\n55% of 10,800 = 0.55 * 10,800\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.55 * 10,800 = 5,940 votes for candidate A.\n\nNext, candidate B's votes:\n\n35% of 10,800 = 0.35 * 10,800\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.35 * 10,800 = 3,780 votes for candidate B.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes candidate A received than candidate B, I need to subtract B's votes from A's votes:\n\n5,940 - 3,780 = 2,160 votes.\n\nSo, candidate A received 2,160 more votes than candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 90% of 12,000 is indeed 10,800.\n\nThen, 55% of 10,800 is 5,940.\n\n35% of 10,800 is 3,780.\n\nSubtracting them gives 2,160.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the percentages.\n\nA has 55%, B has 35%, so the difference is 20%.\n\nSo, 20% of 10,800 should be equal to 2,160.\n\nLet me verify: 20% of 10,800 is 0.2 * 10,800 = 2,160.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2,160 votes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2160} \\]"
