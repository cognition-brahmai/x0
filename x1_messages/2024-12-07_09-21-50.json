        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a basic calculator in Python that takes two numbers and an operator from the user and performs the specified operation.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Calculator\")\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n    if operator == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operator == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operator == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operator == '/':\n        if num2 != 0:\n            result = num1 / num2\n        else:\n            result = \"Error! Division by zero.\"\n    else:\n        result = \"Invalid operator\"\n\n    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The program prompts the user to enter the first number, the operator, and the second number.\n   - The numbers are converted to floating-point values to handle decimal numbers.\n\n2. **Operation Based on Operator:**\n   - If the operator is `+`, it adds the two numbers.\n   - If the operator is `-`, it subtracts the second number from the first.\n   - If the operator is `*`, it multiplies the two numbers.\n   - If the operator is `/`, it divides the first number by the second, checking for division by zero.\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   - If the operator is not one of the specified ones, it prints \"Invalid operator\".\n   - If division by zero is attempted, it prints \"Error! Division by zero.\"\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - The result of the operation is printed.\n\nThis calculator is straightforward and handles basic arithmetic operations with error checking for invalid operators and division by zero."
