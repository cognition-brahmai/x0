        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you develop a PHP web application that does what you've described. We'll need to create a form where users can input their name, age, and favorite color. Then, upon submitting the form, we'll validate the age and favorite color against the specified criteria. If everything checks out, we'll store the data in a MySQL database; otherwise, we'll display an error message.\n\nFirst things first, let's make sure you have a basic understanding of PHP and MySQL. PHP is a server-side scripting language that's widely used for web development, and MySQL is a relational database management system. If you're not familiar with these technologies, don't worry\u2014I'll guide you through the process.\n\nBefore we dive in, ensure you have a web server set up on your machine with PHP and MySQL support. XAMPP is a popular choice for local development environments, as it comes with Apache, PHP, and MySQL pre-installed. Once you have XAMPP or a similar stack installed, you can proceed.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Database\n\nWe need to create a MySQL database and a table to store user data. Open your MySQL command line or use a GUI tool like phpMyAdmin to run the following SQL commands:\n\n```sql\nCREATE DATABASE user_data;\nUSE user_data;\n\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    age INT NOT NULL,\n    favorite_color ENUM('red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple') NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\nThis creates a database named `user_data` and a table named `users` with columns for name, age, and favorite color. The `id` column is an auto-incrementing primary key.\n\n### Step 2: Create the HTML Form\n\nNext, we'll create an HTML form that allows users to input their name, age, and favorite color. We'll use PHP to handle the form submission and validation.\n\nCreate a new file named `index.php` in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` in XAMPP).\n\n```php\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>User Registration</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Register</h1>\n    <form action=\"submit.php\" method=\"post\">\n        <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"age\">Age:</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"age\" name=\"age\" min=\"18\" max=\"99\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"favorite_color\">Favorite Color:</label>\n        <select id=\"favorite_color\" name=\"favorite_color\" required>\n            <option value=\"\">--\u8bf7\u9009\u62e9--</option>\n            <option value=\"red\">\u7ea2\u8272</option>\n            <option value=\"blue\">\u84dd\u8272</option>\n            <option value=\"green\">\u7eff\u8272</option>\n            <option value=\"yellow\">\u9ec4\u8272</option>\n            <option value=\"purple\">\u7d2b\u8272</option>\n        </select><br><br>\n        \n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"\u63d0\u4ea4\">\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis form has fields for name, age, and favorite color. The age field is restricted to numbers between 18 and 99 using HTML5 attributes. The favorite color is selected from a dropdown list with predefined options.\n\n### Step 3: Handle Form Submission and Validation\n\nNow, we need to create a PHP script that processes the form data, validates it, and either stores it in the database or displays an error message.\n\nCreate another file named `submit.php` in the same directory as `index.php`.\n\n```php\n<?php\n$host = 'localhost';\n$db   = 'user_data';\n$user = 'root';\n$pass = '';\n$charset = 'utf8mb4';\n\n$dsn = \"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db;charset=$charset\";\n$opt = [\n    PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE            => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,\n    PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_ASSOC,\n    PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES   => false,\n];\n$pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass, $opt);\n\n$name = $_POST['name'];\n$age = $_POST['age'];\n$favorite_color = $_POST['favorite_color'];\n\n$errors = [];\n\nif (empty($name)) {\n    $errors[] = \"\u540d\u79f0\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e3a\u7a7a\u3002\";\n}\n\nif (!isset($age) || $age < 18 || $age > 99) {\n    $errors[] = \"\u5e74\u9f84\u5fc5\u987b\u572818\u523099\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\";\n}\n\nif (!in_array($favorite_color, ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple'])) {\n    $errors[] = \"\u8bf7\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u989c\u8272\u3002\";\n}\n\nif (!empty($errors)) {\n    foreach ($errors as $error) {\n        echo \"<p>$error</p>\";\n    }\n} else {\n    $stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"INSERT INTO users (name, age, favorite_color) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\");\n    $stmt->execute([$name, $age, $favorite_color]);\n    echo \"<p>\u6570\u636e\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u5b58\u50a8\u3002</p>\";\n}\n?>\n```\n\nIn this script, we first set up the database connection using PDO, which is a secure way to interact with the database.\n\nWe retrieve the form data using `$_POST` superglobal and perform validation checks:\n\n- Ensure the name is not empty.\n\n- Check that the age is set and within the range of 18 to 99.\n\n- Verify that the favorite color is one of the allowed options.\n\nIf any validation fails, we collect error messages in an array. If all validations pass, we prepare an SQL statement to insert the data into the `users` table using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.\n\n### Step 4: Testing the Application\n\nTo test the application, start your web server (Apache via XAMPP, for example), and navigate to `http://localhost/index.php` in your web browser.\n\nFill out the form with valid data and submit it. You should see a \"\u6570\u636e\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u5b58\u50a8\u3002\" message, and the data should be inserted into the `users` table in your database.\n\nTry submitting the form with invalid data to see the error messages in action.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Security:** Always sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks. We've used PDO with prepared statements, which is a good practice.\n\n- **User Experience:** Enhance the user experience by providing more descriptive error messages and maybe using client-side validation in addition to server-side validation.\n\n- **Internationalization:** If your application needs to support multiple languages, consider implementing internationalization features.\n\n- **Styling:** Add CSS to make your form look better. You can link an external stylesheet or add styles directly in the `<head>` section.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple PHP web application that collects user data, validates it, and stores it in a MySQL database. This is a fundamental skill in web development, and you can build upon this foundation to create more complex applications."
