        "content": "During the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, several constellations are prominent in the night sky. Here are five notable ones:\n\n1. **Ursa Major (The Great Bear)**: This is one of the largest constellations in the sky and is known for containing the Big Dipper, a group of seven bright stars that form a distinctive shape resembling a ladle. The Big Dipper is useful for finding the North Star, Polaris, which is located along the line extended from the Dipper's pointer stars.\n\n2. **Ursa Minor (The Little Bear)**: Home to Polaris, the North Star, Ursa Minor is smaller than its counterpart, Ursa Major. Polaris is almost directly above the Earth's North Pole and is essential for navigation.\n\n3. **Cassiopeia**: This W-shaped constellation is easily recognizable and is located near Polaris. Cassiopeia is named after a queen in Greek mythology and is visible throughout the year in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n4. **Cygnus (The Swan)**: Also known as the Northern Cross, Cygnus is a prominent summer constellation. It contains Deneb, one of the brightest stars in the night sky, and is part of the Milky Way.\n\n5. **Lyra (The Lyre)**: This small constellation is home to Vega, one of the brightest stars in the sky. Lyra is associated with the myth of Orpheus and his magical lyre.\n\nThese constellations are not only beautiful to observe but also rich in astronomical objects and historical significance."
