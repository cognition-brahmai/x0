        "content": "Let's evaluate the expression \\((5^2 - 3 \\times 4) / (6 - 2 \\times 3)\\). I need to be careful with the order of operations here, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right. This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nFirst, I'll handle the exponent in the numerator:\n\n\\(5^2 = 25\\)\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n\\((25 - 3 \\times 4) / (6 - 2 \\times 3)\\)\n\nNext, I need to do the multiplications before the subtractions:\n\nIn the numerator:\n\n\\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n\nSo it's:\n\n\\((25 - 12) / (6 - 2 \\times 3)\\)\n\nNow, subtraction in the numerator:\n\n\\(25 - 12 = 13\\)\n\nSo it's:\n\n\\(13 / (6 - 2 \\times 3)\\)\n\nNow, in the denominator, again, multiplication before subtraction:\n\n\\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n\nSo it's:\n\n\\(13 / (6 - 6)\\)\n\nNow, subtraction in the denominator:\n\n\\(6 - 6 = 0\\)\n\nSo the expression is:\n\n\\(13 / 0\\)\n\nWait a minute, division by zero is undefined. So the entire expression is undefined because you can't divide by zero.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\((5^2 - 3 \\times 4) / (6 - 2 \\times 3)\\)\n\nExponent:\n\n\\(25 - 3 \\times 4 / 6 - 2 \\times 3\\)\n\nWait, no, I have to respect the parentheses.\n\nSo it's:\n\nNumerator: \\(5^2 - 3 \\times 4 = 25 - 12 = 13\\)\n\nDenominator: \\(6 - 2 \\times 3 = 6 - 6 = 0\\)\n\nSo indeed, \\(13 / 0\\) is undefined.\n\nTherefore, the expression is undefined due to division by zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{undefined}} \\]"
