        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces widgets at different rates over time. Specifically, it starts by producing 10 widgets per hour and after 4 hours, the production rate increases to 15 widgets per hour. We need to find out how many widgets are produced after a total of 12 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the time periods based on the changes in production rate. There are two distinct periods here:\n\n1. The first 4 hours, during which the factory produces at 10 widgets per hour.\n\n2. The remaining time after the first 4 hours, during which the production rate is 15 widgets per hour.\n\nSince the total time is 12 hours, the second period would be 12 hours minus the initial 4 hours, which is 8 hours.\n\nNow, I can calculate the number of widgets produced in each period separately and then sum them up to get the total production after 12 hours.\n\nLet's start with the first period:\n\nProduction rate: 10 widgets per hour\n\nTime: 4 hours\n\nWidgets produced in the first period = production rate \u00d7 time = 10 widgets/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 40 widgets\n\nNext, the second period:\n\nProduction rate: 15 widgets per hour\n\nTime: 8 hours\n\nWidgets produced in the second period = production rate \u00d7 time = 15 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 120 widgets\n\nNow, to find the total widgets produced after 12 hours, I add the widgets from both periods:\n\nTotal widgets = widgets from first period + widgets from second period = 40 + 120 = 160 widgets\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any possibility that the production rate changes again after the first 4 hours? The problem says that after 4 hours, the production rate increases to 15 widgets per hour, and we're considering the total time of 12 hours. So, for the remaining 8 hours, the rate is 15 widgets per hour.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total production using the concept of average production rate, but given that the production rate changes only once, it's simpler to calculate each period separately and sum them up.\n\nLet me consider if there's another approach. For example, what if I try to calculate the total production using integration, considering the production rate as a function of time? But that seems like overkill for this problem, as we have constant production rates for distinct time intervals.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a step function where the production rate steps up after 4 hours. Again, this reinforces the approach of calculating production for each step separately.\n\nIs there any chance that the production rate increases gradually between 4 and 12 hours? The problem states that the rate increases to 15 widgets per hour after 4 hours, which suggests an immediate change to the new rate at that point.\n\nAssuming that the rate changes instantly at the 4-hour mark, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the total production, such as downtime, maintenance, or variations in production rate over time. However, the problem doesn't mention any such factors, so I can assume that production continues at the specified rates without interruptions.\n\nAlso, I should confirm the units to ensure consistency. The production rates are given in widgets per hour, and the time is in hours, so the units match up correctly when multiplying to find the number of widgets.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether the production starts at time zero or if there's any initial delay. The problem states that the factory produces widgets at 10 per hour, and after 4 hours, the rate increases. So, production starts immediately at 10 widgets per hour.\n\nLet me also verify the arithmetic to make sure there are no calculation errors.\n\nFirst period: 10 widgets/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 40 widgets\n\nSecond period: 15 widgets/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 120 widgets\n\nTotal: 40 + 120 = 160 widgets\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average production rate over the 12 hours. The average rate would be the total widgets produced divided by the total time. But since we don't know the total widgets yet, that approach doesn't help directly.\n\nHowever, if I were to calculate the average rate, it would be (total widgets)/12 hours, but again, that doesn't simplify the calculation.\n\nGiven that, I think the initial approach is the most straightforward and accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of widgets produced after 12 hours is 160.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
