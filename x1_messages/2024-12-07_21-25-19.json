        "content": "Let's see. There are 7 days in a week, and I need to find out how many weeks there are in a year. I know that a year has 365 days, except for leap years which have 366. But for now, I'll assume it's a non-leap year, so 365 days.\n\nSo, to find the number of weeks in a year, I should divide the total number of days in a year by the number of days in a week. That makes sense.\n\nSo, that's 365 days divided by 7 days per week.\n\nLet me do the division: 365 \u00f7 7.\n\n7 times 50 is 350, which is less than 365. 365 minus 350 is 15.\n\nNow, 7 times 2 is 14, which is less than 15. So, that's 2 more weeks.\n\n15 minus 14 is 1 day left over.\n\nSo, in total, there are 50 weeks plus 2 weeks, which is 52 weeks, and 1 extra day.\n\nWait, but 7 times 52 is 364, and there's 1 day left over.\n\nYes, that matches what I just calculated.\n\nSo, there are 52 weeks in a year, with 1 extra day in a non-leap year.\n\nIn a leap year, there would be 366 days, which means 52 weeks and 2 extra days.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify, I'll stick with the 52 weeks in a non-leap year.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52} \\]"
