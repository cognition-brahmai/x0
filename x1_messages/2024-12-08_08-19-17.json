        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a car traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to find out the total distance it covers. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, so for this part, the distance should be 60 mph times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nThen, the car travels at another average speed of 45 mph for 3 hours. Again, using the formula distance equals speed times time, that would be 45 mph times 3 hours, which is 135 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance covered, I just need to add these two distances together: 120 miles plus 135 miles equals 255 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? The car is traveling in two different segments with different speeds and times. But the problem doesn't mention anything about the path being straight or if the car changed direction. If the car changed direction, the displacement might be different from the total distance traveled, but the question asks for the total distance covered, not displacement. So, I think adding the two distances is correct.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to be sure. First segment: 60 mph times 2 hours is indeed 120 miles. Second segment: 45 mph times 3 hours is 135 miles. Adding them up gives 255 miles. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think the total distance covered by the car is 255 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{255} \\]"
