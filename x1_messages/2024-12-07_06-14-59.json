        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 200 widgets per hour. They decide to increase production by 50% because of higher demand. Okay, first things first, I need to figure out what the new production rate is after this 50% increase.\n\nSo, increasing production by 50% means they're adding half of the original production to itself. Half of 200 is 100, so adding that to the original 200 gives us a new production rate of 300 widgets per hour. Alternatively, I could calculate it by multiplying the original production by 1.5, since a 50% increase is the same as multiplying by 1.5. So, 200 times 1.5 is indeed 300. Okay, that checks out.\n\nNow, after this increase, they find that 20% of the widgets produced are defective. That means that out of the 300 widgets produced per hour, 20% are defective. I need to find out how many that is. 20% of 300 is calculated by multiplying 300 by 0.2, which equals 60. So, 60 widgets are defective per hour.\n\nTo find the number of non-defective widgets, I subtract the defective ones from the total production. So, 300 minus 60 equals 240 non-defective widgets per hour.\n\nBut the question is asking for the net increase in non-defective widgets produced per hour. That means I need to compare the current number of non-defective widgets to the original number before the production increase.\n\nOriginally, they were producing 200 widgets per hour. Assuming that before the increase, there were no defective widgets mentioned, I might assume that all were non-defective. But maybe I should consider that there could have been defects before as well, but since it's not specified, perhaps it's safe to assume that originally, all 200 widgets were non-defective.\n\nSo, originally, 200 non-defective widgets per hour, and now, after the increase, 240 non-defective widgets per hour. The net increase would be the difference between these two numbers: 240 minus 200, which is 40.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if my assumption about original defects is correct. The problem states that after increasing production, they realize that 20% of the widgets are defective. It doesn't mention anything about defects before the production increase, so perhaps it's fair to assume that originally, there were no defects, or that the defect rate was negligible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the defect rate was different before, but since it's not specified, I'll stick with assuming that originally, all widgets were non-defective.\n\nTherefore, the net increase in non-defective widgets produced per hour is 40.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there was a defect rate before as well, and I need to account for that. However, since the problem doesn't provide any information about the original defect rate, I think it's reasonable to assume that originally, all widgets were non-defective.\n\nSo, my final answer is a net increase of 40 non-defective widgets per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
