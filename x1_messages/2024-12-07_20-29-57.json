Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element that belongs to the alkali metal group. It is highly reactive and is found in nature only in compounds, never as a free element. Potassium is essential for the proper functioning of all living cells, playing a critical role in maintaining electrolyte balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction. It is also an important nutrient in agriculture, used in fertilizers to promote plant growth."
