        "content": "Let's see. So, John has twice as many marbles as Mary, and together they have 36 marbles. I need to find out how many marbles John has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to the number of marbles each person has. Let's say Mary has M marbles. Since John has twice as many as Mary, he would have 2M marbles.\n\nNow, together they have 36 marbles, so Mary's marbles plus John's marbles equal 36. That would be M + 2M = 36.\n\nCombining like terms, that's 3M = 36.\n\nTo find M, I can divide both sides by 3: M = 36 / 3 = 12.\n\nSo, Mary has 12 marbles. Since John has twice as many, John has 2 * 12 = 24 marbles.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If Mary has 12 and John has 24, together that's 12 + 24 = 36, which matches the total given.\n\nAlternatively, I could use algebra to solve it systematically.\n\nLet M = number of marbles Mary has.\n\nThen John has 2M marbles.\n\nTogether: M + 2M = 36.\n\nSo, 3M = 36.\n\nM = 12.\n\nTherefore, John has 2 * 12 = 24 marbles.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that for every marble Mary has, John has two. So together, for every marble Mary has, they have three marbles in total (1 for Mary and 2 for John).\n\nSo, if they have 36 marbles in total, and this total is made up of 3 marbles for each of Mary's marbles, then the number of marbles Mary has is 36 / 3 = 12.\n\nThen, John has twice that, which is 24.\n\nAlternatively, you could think in terms of ratios. The ratio of Mary's marbles to John's marbles is 1:2.\n\nSo, the total parts are 1 + 2 = 3 parts.\n\nEach part represents 36 / 3 = 12 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Mary has 1 part, which is 12 marbles, and John has 2 parts, which is 24 marbles.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: John has 24 marbles.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nSuppose I let J represent the number of marbles John has, and M represent the number Mary has.\n\nI know that J = 2M (since John has twice as many as Mary).\n\nAnd J + M = 36 (together they have 36 marbles).\n\nSo, I can substitute the first equation into the second: 2M + M = 36.\n\nThat simplifies to 3M = 36, so M = 12.\n\nThen, J = 2 * 12 = 24.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI could also solve it using equations.\n\nLet me set up the system of equations:\n\n1) J = 2M\n\n2) J + M = 36\n\nI can substitute the first equation into the second:\n\n2M + M = 36\n\n3M = 36\n\nM = 12\n\nThen, J = 24.\n\nAlternatively, I could use elimination or other algebraic methods, but that's unnecessary for this straightforward problem.\n\nIt's clear that John has 24 marbles.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any trick or if I'm missing something.\n\nThe problem says \"John has twice as many marbles as Mary\" and \"together they have 36 marbles.\"\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any trick here; it's a straightforward ratio problem.\n\nI've solved it using different methods, and all of them give me the same answer: John has 24 marbles.\n\nSo, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
