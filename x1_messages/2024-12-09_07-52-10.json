        "content": "Let's see here. There are three candidates in the school election: A, B, and C. Candidate A got 40% of the votes, candidate B got 35%, and candidate C got the rest. The total number of votes cast was 1200. I need to find out how many more votes candidate A received compared to candidate B.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many votes each candidate got. Starting with candidate A, who got 40% of 1200 votes. To calculate that, I can multiply 1200 by 40% or 0.40.\n\nSo, votes for candidate A = 1200 * 0.40.\n\nSimilarly, votes for candidate B = 1200 * 0.35.\n\nThen, to find out how many more votes candidate A received than candidate B, I'll subtract the votes for B from the votes for A.\n\nLet me do the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, votes for A:\n\n1200 * 0.40 = 480 votes.\n\nNext, votes for B:\n\n1200 * 0.35 = 420 votes.\n\nNow, the difference:\n\n480 - 420 = 60 votes.\n\nSo, candidate A received 60 more votes than candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe in terms of percentages.\n\nThe difference in percentages between A and B is 40% - 35% = 5%.\n\nSo, 5% of the total votes would be the difference.\n\nLet's calculate 5% of 1200 to verify.\n\n5% of 1200 = 1200 * 0.05 = 60 votes.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also check how many votes candidate C received.\n\nCandidate C got the remaining votes, which is 100% - 40% - 35% = 25%.\n\nSo, votes for C = 1200 * 0.25 = 300 votes.\n\nAdding up all the votes: 480 (A) + 420 (B) + 300 (C) = 1200, which matches the total votes cast.\n\nEverything seems consistent here.\n\nSo, the final answer is that candidate A received 60 more votes than candidate B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
