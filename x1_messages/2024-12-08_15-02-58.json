Let's break down the task into smaller steps to make it easier to understand and implement.\n\nFirst, we need to read a CSV file that contains information about students, specifically their name, age, and grade. Then, we need to sort these students based on their grades in descending order. Finally, we should calculate the average grade of all the students and print it to the console.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll need to use several features of Java, including file I/O for reading the CSV file, data structures to store the student information, sorting mechanisms to order the students by grade, and basic arithmetic to calculate the average grade.\n\nLet's start by planning the structure of our program.\n\n### Step 1: Define a Student Class\n\nWe should create a class to represent a student, which will have fields for name, age, and grade. This class will also have getters and setters for these fields.\n\n```java\npublic class Student {\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private double grade;\n\n    // Constructor\n    public Student(String name, int age, double grade) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.grade = grade;\n    }\n\n    // Getters and setters\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    public void setAge(int age) {\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n\n    public double getGrade() {\n        return grade;\n    }\n\n    public void setGrade(double grade) {\n        this.grade = grade;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Read the CSV File\n\nWe need to read the CSV file and parse its content to create Student objects. We can use the `BufferedReader` class to read the file line by line.\n\nAssuming the CSV file has the following format:\n\n```\nname,age,grade\nJohn Doe,20,85.5\nJane Smith,22,90.0\n...\n```\n\nWe'll need to skip the header line and parse the remaining lines into Student objects.\n\n### Step 3: Store Students in a List\n\nWe'll store the Student objects in an `ArrayList` for easy manipulation.\n\n### Step 4: Sort the Students by Grade in Descending Order\n\nTo sort the list of students by their grades in descending order, we can use the `Collections.sort()` method with a custom `Comparator`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Average Grade\n\nWe'll iterate through the list of students, sum up all the grades, and then divide by the number of students to get the average.\n\n### Step 6: Print the Sorted List and the Average Grade\n\nFinally, we'll print the sorted list of students and the calculated average grade to the console.\n\nNow, let's proceed to implement each step in code.\n\n### Full Java Program\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Comparator;\n\nclass Student {\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private double grade;\n\n    public Student(String name, int age, double grade) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.grade = grade;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    public void setAge(int age) {\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n\n    public double getGrade() {\n        return grade;\n    }\n\n    public void setGrade(double grade) {\n        this.grade = grade;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Student{name='\" + name + \"', age=\" + age + \", grade=\" + grade + \"}\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class StudentSorter {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();\n        String csvFile = \"students.csv\";\n        String line;\n        String cvsSplitBy = \",\";\n\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(csvFile))) {\n            // Skip the header line\n            br.readLine();\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                String[] studentData = line.split(cvsSplitBy);\n                if (studentData.length == 3) {\n                    String name = studentData[0];\n                    int age = Integer.parseInt(studentData[1]);\n                    double grade = Double.parseDouble(studentData[2]);\n                    students.add(new Student(name, age, grade));\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        // Sort students by grade in descending order\n        Collections.sort(students, new Comparator<Student>() {\n            public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {\n                return Double.compare(s2.getGrade(), s1.getGrade());\n            }\n        });\n\n        // Print sorted students\n        for (Student student : students) {\n            System.out.println(student);\n        }\n\n        // Calculate and print average grade\n        double sum = 0;\n        for (Student student : students) {\n            sum += student.getGrade();\n        }\n        double average = students.isEmpty() ? 0 : sum / students.size();\n        System.out.println(\"Average Grade: \" + average);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Student Class**: Represents a student with name, age, and grade.\n2. **Reading CSV**: Using `BufferedReader` to read the file and parse each line into a `Student` object.\n3. **Storing Students**: Using an `ArrayList` to store student objects.\n4. **Sorting Students**: Using `Collections.sort()` with a custom `Comparator` to sort students by grade in descending order.\n5. **Calculating Average**: Summing up all grades and dividing by the number of students.\n6. **Printing Results**: Printing the sorted list of students and the average grade.\n\nThis program should fulfill the requirements you've outlined. If you have any specific CSV file path or format differences, you might need to adjust the code accordingly."
