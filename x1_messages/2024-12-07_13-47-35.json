        "content": "So I've got this sequence defined by the formula a_n = 3n + 5, and I need to find the sum of the first 10 terms. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what kind of sequence this is. The formula a_n = 3n + 5 looks linear, with n being the term number. That suggests it's an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a constant difference.\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let me check that here. Let's calculate the first few terms to see.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = 3(1) + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = 3(2) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11\n\nFor n = 3: a_3 = 3(3) + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14\n\nOkay, so the differences between terms are:\n\na_2 - a_1 = 11 - 8 = 3\n\na_3 - a_2 = 14 - 11 = 3\n\nSo, yes, the common difference d is 3.\n\nNow, for an arithmetic sequence, the sum of the first n terms is given by:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nAlternatively, it can also be expressed as:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)\n\nI can use either formula. Maybe I'll use the second one because I already know a_1 and d.\n\nGiven:\n\nn = 10 (since we need the sum of the first 10 terms)\n\na_1 = 8\n\nd = 3\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nS_10 = 10/2 * (2*8 + (10 - 1)*3)\n\nLet's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 10/2 = 5\n\nThen, 2*8 = 16\n\nNext, (10 - 1)*3 = 9*3 = 27\n\nNow, 16 + 27 = 43\n\nFinally, 5*43 = 215\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 terms is 215.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the first formula: S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nI have a_1 = 8, but I need a_10.\n\nLet's find a_10 using the sequence formula:\n\na_10 = 3(10) + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35\n\nNow, S_10 = 10/2 * (8 + 35) = 5 * 43 = 215\n\nSame answer. Okay, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, I could manually add up the first 10 terms to verify.\n\na_1 = 8\n\na_2 = 11\n\na_3 = 14\n\na_4 = 3(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17\n\na_5 = 3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20\n\na_6 = 3(6) + 5 = 18 + 5 = 23\n\na_7 = 3(7) + 5 = 21 + 5 = 26\n\na_8 = 3(8) + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29\n\na_9 = 3(9) + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32\n\na_10 = 35\n\nNow, adding them up: 8 + 11 = 19; 19 + 14 = 33; 33 + 17 = 50; 50 + 20 = 70; 70 + 23 = 93; 93 + 26 = 119; 119 + 29 = 148; 148 + 32 = 180; 180 + 35 = 215\n\nAgain, 215. Consistent results.\n\nAlternatively, since it's an arithmetic sequence, I could use the formula for the sum, which I did.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use the general formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.\n\nThe sum S_n is given by S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n), which is what I used.\n\nAlternatively, S_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d], which is the other formula I used.\n\nBoth gave me the same answer, and manual addition also matched.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the sum of the first 10 terms is 215.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{215} \\]"
