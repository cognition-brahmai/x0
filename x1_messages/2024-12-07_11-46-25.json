        "content": "Let's calculate the total cost for the customer who bought oranges and apples at different prices per pound.\n\nFirst, the store sells oranges at $4 per pound. The customer bought 5 pounds of oranges. So, the cost for oranges would be:\n\nCost of oranges = price per pound \u00d7 number of pounds\nCost of oranges = $4/pound \u00d7 5 pounds\nCost of oranges = $20\n\nNext, the store sells apples at $3 per pound. The customer bought 4 pounds of apples. So, the cost for apples would be:\n\nCost of apples = price per pound \u00d7 number of pounds\nCost of apples = $3/pound \u00d7 4 pounds\nCost of apples = $12\n\nNow, to find the total cost, we need to add the cost of oranges and the cost of apples together:\n\nTotal cost = cost of oranges + cost of apples\nTotal cost = $20 + $12\nTotal cost = $32\n\nTherefore, the total cost for the customer is $32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
