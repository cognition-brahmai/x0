Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, was a renowned American writer and humorist. Despite his literary successes, he faced financial difficulties in his personal life, largely attributed to his involvement in risky business ventures and poor financial decisions. This period of bankruptcy marked a challenging time in his life, but he eventually recovered and continued to contribute significantly to American literature."
