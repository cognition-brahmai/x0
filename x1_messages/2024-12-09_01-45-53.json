        "content": "So there's this puzzle here: a man builds a house that's rectangular, and all sides face south. Then a big bear walks by, and the question is, what color is the bear? Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the house is rectangular and all sides face south. That sounds a bit impossible, right? Usually, in a rectangle, each side faces a different direction. But here, all sides face south. So, there must be something unique about the location of this house.\n\nMaybe it's not on flat ground? Wait, the problem says it's built on a rectangular shape, so probably flat. Or is it possible that the house is built on a curved surface, like the Earth?\n\nAh, maybe it's on the Earth's surface, and we need to consider the curvature. I recall that on a sphere, directions can behave differently than on a flat plane.\n\nLet me think about directions on a sphere. If you're standing at the North Pole, every direction is south. So, if the house is built at the North Pole, all sides of the house would face south.\n\nBut wait, the North Pole is in the Arctic, and there are no bears there, right? Actually, there are polar bears in the Arctic. Polar bears are white. So, if the house is at the North Pole, and a big bear walks by, it's likely a polar bear, which is white.\n\nBut the problem says \"a big bear.\" Is there any other place where all sides of a house could face south? Let me think.\n\nIf the house is built around the South Pole, then all sides would face north, because every direction from the South Pole is north. But the problem says all sides face south, so that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe there's a point on the Earth where all directions are south. North Pole seems to be the only such point. So, perhaps the house is at the North Pole.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I'm at the North Pole, and I build a house with four sides, each side would indeed face south, because all directions from the North Pole are south.\n\nOkay, so the house is at the North Pole.\n\nNow, a big bear walks by. What kind of bears are there at the North Pole? Polar bears.\n\nPolar bears are typically white in color, as a form of camouflage in the snowy environment.\n\nSo, the bear is white.\n\nBut wait, is that the only possibility? Are there any other bears that could be there?\n\nWell, the North Pole has polar bears, but are there any other places where all sides of a house could face south?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose the house is built on a hill or a mound near the North Pole. Would that affect the directions?\n\nNo, because directions are determined by the Earth's axis, not by local terrain features.\n\nAlternatively, if the house is built on a concave surface, but that's not likely.\n\nOr maybe if the house is built on a sphere where the poles are differently oriented.\n\nWait, but the Earth is a sphere, and the North Pole is the northernmost point.\n\nIs there any other planet or scenario where this could be different? But the problem seems to be set on Earth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the house is floating in space, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nNo, it's probably safe to assume that the house is on Earth, and the only place where all sides can face south is the North Pole.\n\nTherefore, the bear is a polar bear, which is white.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other bears that could be white or found in Arctic regions.\n\nWell, polar bears are the only bears native to the Arctic. Sometimes, other bear species can be found in captivity in Arctic regions, but in a natural setting, it's polar bears.\n\nMoreover, the problem specifies a \"big bear.\" Polar bears are indeed large bears, often larger than brown bears.\n\nSo, putting all this together, the bear is white.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{white}} \\]"
