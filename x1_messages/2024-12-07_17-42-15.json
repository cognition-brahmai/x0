You want to know the total units produced in a month for both products.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many units of each product are made in a month and then add them together.\n\nFor product A:\n\n1500 units/day \u00d7 25 days = 37,500 units/month\n\nFor product B:\n\n2000 units/day \u00d7 25 days = 50,000 units/month\n\nNow, add both monthly productions together:\n\n37,500 units (A) + 50,000 units (B) = 87,500 units total per month\n\nSo, the factory produces a total of 87,500 units in a month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{87500} \\]"
