        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box containing 12 balls, and each ball weighs either 10 grams or 20 grams. The total weight of all the balls is 180 grams. We need to find out how many of these balls weigh 20 grams.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being asked. We have a mix of two types of balls: lighter ones that weigh 10 grams and heavier ones that weigh 20 grams. Together, there are 12 balls, and their combined weight is 180 grams. We need to figure out how many of the heavier balls are in the box.\n\nOne way to approach this is to set up equations based on the information given. Let's define variables for the number of each type of ball.\n\nLet:\n- \\( x \\) be the number of 10-gram balls.\n- \\( y \\) be the number of 20-gram balls.\n\nWe know two things:\n1. The total number of balls is 12.\n2. The total weight of the balls is 180 grams.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + y = 12 \\]\n\nFrom the second piece of information, since the total weight is the sum of the weights of each type of ball, we can write:\n\\[ 10x + 20y = 180 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n1. \\( x + y = 12 \\)\n2. \\( 10x + 20y = 180 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's try the substitution method.\n\nFirst, solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 12 - y \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ 10(12 - y) + 20y = 180 \\]\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\\[ 120 - 10y + 20y = 180 \\]\n\\[ 120 + 10y = 180 \\]\n\\[ 10y = 180 - 120 \\]\n\\[ 10y = 60 \\]\n\\[ y = 6 \\]\n\nSo, there are 6 balls that weigh 20 grams.\n\nTo find the number of 10-gram balls, we can substitute \\( y = 6 \\) back into the first equation:\n\\[ x + 6 = 12 \\]\n\\[ x = 12 - 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 6 balls that weigh 10 grams and 6 balls that weigh 20 grams.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this. If there are 6 balls of 10 grams and 6 balls of 20 grams, the total weight would be:\n\\[ 6 \\times 10 + 6 \\times 20 = 60 + 120 = 180 \\] grams, which matches the given total weight.\n\nAlso, the total number of balls is \\( 6 + 6 = 12 \\), which matches the given number.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the elimination method to solve the system of equations. Let's try that to confirm.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 12 \\)\n2. \\( 10x + 20y = 180 \\)\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 10:\n\\[ x + 2y = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we have:\n1. \\( x + y = 12 \\)\n2. \\( x + 2y = 18 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 18 - 12 \\]\n\\[ x + 2y - x - y = 6 \\]\n\\[ y = 6 \\]\n\nAgain, we find that \\( y = 6 \\), which matches our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the number of 20-gram balls is 6.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the average weight of the balls. The total weight is 180 grams for 12 balls, so the average weight per ball is:\n\\[ \\frac{180}{12} = 15 \\] grams.\n\nSince the balls weigh either 10 grams or 20 grams, and the average is 15 grams, which is exactly in the middle, it makes sense that there are equal numbers of each type of ball. Hence, 6 balls of each type.\n\nThis intuitive approach confirms our mathematical solution.\n\nAlternatively, we could have considered the problem as a weighted average or used ratios, but the straightforward algebraic method seems sufficient here.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 6 balls that weigh 20 grams in the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
