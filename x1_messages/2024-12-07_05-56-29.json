        "content": "So the restaurant serves 300 meals in 6 hours. We want to find out how many meals they serve in a whole week at that same rate. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rate at which the restaurant serves meals. If they serve 300 meals in 6 hours, I can find out how many meals they serve per hour. That might help me figure out the weekly total.\n\nSo, meals per hour would be total meals divided by total hours. That is 300 meals divided by 6 hours, which is 50 meals per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how many meals they serve in a week, I need to know how many hours they are open in a week. But the problem doesn't specify that. Maybe I need to assume they are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Or perhaps they only operate for those 6 hours once or multiple times a day.\n\nWait, maybe the 6 hours is their daily operating time. If that's the case, and they serve 300 meals each day for 6 hours, then I can calculate the daily total and then multiply by 7 for the week.\n\nSo, if they serve 300 meals per day and are open 6 hours a day, but actually, wait a minute, they serve 300 meals in 6 hours, which is their daily operation. So daily, they serve 300 meals.\n\nBut perhaps they operate more than once a day. Maybe they have multiple shifts or different operating periods. For example, some restaurants are open in the morning and evening for meals like breakfast and dinner.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that. So, maybe it's safest to assume they operate for 6 hours once a day and serve 300 meals during that time.\n\nTherefore, in one day, they serve 300 meals.\n\nIn a week, there are 7 days, so total meals in a week would be 300 meals/day times 7 days.\n\nLet me calculate that: 300 times 7 is 2100 meals per week.\n\nBut wait, maybe they operate more than once a day. For example, maybe they are open for lunch and dinner, totaling 6 hours a day.\n\nIf that's the case, and they serve 300 meals in those 6 hours, that would still be 300 meals per day.\n\nUnless they serve the same number of meals each time they're open.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider that the 6 hours could be spread over different periods in a day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6 hours is their total operating time for the whole week.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because 6 hours in a week would be only a short operation time.\n\nWait, let's look back at the problem: \"in 6 hours\" probably refers to their daily operation time.\n\nSo, again, assuming they operate 6 hours a day and serve 300 meals in that time, then daily meals are 300.\n\nWeekly meals would be 300 meals/day times 7 days/week, which is 2100 meals/week.\n\nBut perhaps they are open every day of the week without any breaks. If they are closed on certain days, I would need to adjust the calculation.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any days off, so maybe it's safe to assume they are open 7 days a week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps holidays or other factors affect their operation, but again, the problem doesn't provide that information.\n\nSo, sticking with the information given, 300 meals in 6 hours per day, 7 days a week, total of 2100 meals per week.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet's consider the rate per hour again. 50 meals per hour.\n\nIf they operate 6 hours a day, 7 days a week, then total hours in a week would be 6 hours/day times 7 days, which is 42 hours.\n\nAt 50 meals per hour, total meals in a week would be 50 meals/hour times 42 hours, which is also 2100 meals.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, if the 6 hours is their total operating time for the week, then 300 meals in 6 hours would mean 50 meals per hour.\n\nTotal meals per week would then be 300 meals, which seems too low, considering it's for the entire week.\n\nBut that contradicts the daily operation assumption.\n\nGiven that, it's more likely that the 6 hours is daily, leading to 2100 meals per week.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem means that in a 6-hour period, they serve 300 meals, and this 6-hour period repeats multiple times in a week.\n\nFor example, maybe they have multiple shifts where each shift is 6 hours and they serve 300 meals per shift.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the most straightforward approach is to assume that they operate 6 hours a day, 7 days a week, serving 300 meals per day, resulting in 2100 meals per week.\n\nAlternatively, if they operate 6 hours per day and serve 300 meals per day, but only operate for a certain number of days a week, then the weekly total would be different.\n\nBut without specified days of operation, 7 days a week is a reasonable assumption.\n\nTherefore, the restaurant serves approximately 2100 meals per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2100} \\]"
