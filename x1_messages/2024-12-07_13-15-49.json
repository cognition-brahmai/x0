        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have machines making widgets, and we're trying to figure out how time relates to the number of machines and the number of widgets.\n\nLet's break it down. If 5 machines take 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, that means each machine is making one widget in 5 minutes, right? Because 5 machines making 5 widgets in 5 minutes means each machine is responsible for one widget in that time period.\n\nSo, if one machine takes 5 minutes to make one widget, then how does that scale up to 100 machines making 100 widgets?\n\nWell, if each machine makes one widget in 5 minutes, then 100 machines should be able to make 100 widgets in the same 5 minutes, assuming each machine works independently and doesn't affect the others.\n\nWait a minute, is that too straightforward? Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about it differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the rate at which widgets are being produced. If 5 machines make 5 widgets in 5 minutes, the rate is 5 widgets per 5 minutes, which is 1 widget per minute for the group of 5 machines. But that doesn't seem right because individually, each machine is making one widget in 5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of machine-minutes. If one machine takes 5 minutes to make one widget, that's 5 machine-minutes per widget.\n\nSo, for 100 widgets, it would require 100 widgets times 5 machine-minutes per widget, which is 500 machine-minutes.\n\nNow, if I have 100 machines working together, the time required would be the total machine-minutes divided by the number of machines. So, 500 machine-minutes divided by 100 machines equals 5 minutes.\n\nOkay, that matches my initial thought. So, it would still take 5 minutes for 100 machines to make 100 widgets.\n\nBut let's double-check. If each machine is making one widget in 5 minutes, then regardless of how many machines you have, as long as you have as many machines as widgets, each machine can make one widget in that time frame.\n\nSo, 100 machines can make 100 widgets in 5 minutes.\n\nI think that's the answer, but maybe there's a different way to look at it. Some people might think that more machines would mean less time, but in this case, since the number of machines matches the number of widgets, the time remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thinks that time is inversely proportional to the number of machines, they might think that 100 machines would take less time than 5 machines to make 100 widgets. But that would be incorrect because each machine is still only making one widget in 5 minutes.\n\nWait, no. If you have more machines than widgets, then some machines would be idle, but in this case, the number of machines matches the number of widgets, so all machines are utilized efficiently.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the time it takes for one machine to make one widget, which is 5 minutes, and then see that for 100 machines making 100 widgets, it's the same as 100 machines each making one widget in 5 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5 minutes.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any constraints or if the machines can work on multiple widgets simultaneously. The problem states that 5 machines make 5 widgets in 5 minutes, which suggests that each machine is making one widget in that time period.\n\nTherefore, scaling up to 100 machines and 100 widgets should still take 5 minutes.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
