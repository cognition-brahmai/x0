        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a square garden with an area of 64 square meters, and I need to figure out how much fencing is required to enclose it, including a gate that's 1 meter wide. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since the garden is square and has an area of 64 square meters, I need to find the length of one side of the square. I recall that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one side. So, if the area is 64 square meters, that means:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side length}^2 = 64\n\\]\n\nTo find the side length, I take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side length} = \\sqrt{64} = 8 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nOkay, so each side of the square garden is 8 meters long.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much fencing is needed to go around the garden, but there's a gate that's 1 meter wide. That means that instead of fencing the entire perimeter, I can subtract the width of the gate from the total perimeter.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total perimeter of the square garden. The perimeter of a square is four times the length of one side:\n\n\\[\n\\text{perimeter} = 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSince there's a gate that's 1 meter wide, I need to subtract that from the total perimeter to find out how much fencing is needed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{fencing needed} = \\text{perimeter} - \\text{gate width} = 32 - 1 = 31 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure about this. The gate is 1 meter wide, which means that's the part where fencing isn't needed because that's where the entrance is. So, subtracting 1 meter from the total perimeter seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check. If the garden is 8 meters on each side, the total distance around it is 32 meters. If I'm not fencing 1 meter for the gate, then indeed, 31 meters of fencing should be sufficient.\n\nIs there any other factor I need to consider? For example, maybe the gate requires additional fencing on either side or something like that. But the problem doesn't specify any such requirements; it just mentions one gate that is 1 meter wide. So, I think subtracting 1 meter from the total perimeter is the right approach.\n\nTherefore, the amount of fencing needed is 31 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]"
