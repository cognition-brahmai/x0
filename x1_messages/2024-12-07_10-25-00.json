        "content": "So the zoo wants to build a new exhibit for their exotic birds. They need an enclosed aviary that's at least 10,000 square feet, plus some landscaping, walkways, and viewing areas for visitors. The construction cost for the aviary is $200 per square foot, and the landscaping and other amenities will cost an extra $100,000. I need to figure out the total cost of building this new bird exhibit.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the cost of the aviary itself. It's going to be 10,000 square feet, and each square foot costs $200. So, I can multiply the area by the cost per square foot:\n\n10,000 sq ft * $200/sq ft = $2,000,000\n\nThat's the cost for the aviary.\n\nNext, there are landscaping and other visitor amenities that will cost an additional $100,000. So, I need to add that to the aviary cost:\n\n$2,000,000 + $100,000 = $2,100,000\n\nTherefore, the total cost of building the new bird exhibit is $2,100,000.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other costs I should consider. For example, are there any permits or approvals needed from local governments? That might add some cost. Also, what about the cost of the birds themselves or any special lighting, heating, or watering systems that might be required for the aviary? And don't forget about labor costs for construction workers.\n\nHmm, but based on the information provided, the only costs mentioned are the construction cost for the aviary and the landscaping and amenities. So, perhaps for the purpose of this question, we're only supposed to consider those expenses.\n\nStill, in real life, there would likely be more costs involved, such as:\n\n- Design and planning fees\n\n- Permit fees\n\n- Utilities installation\n\n- Maintenance equipment\n\n- Initial stocking of plants and trees for landscaping\n\n- Employee training for bird care\n\n- Marketing and promotion of the new exhibit\n\nBut since these aren't mentioned, I'll stick with the given costs.\n\nSo, the total cost is $2,100,000.\n\nI think that's the answer based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2100000} \\]\n"
