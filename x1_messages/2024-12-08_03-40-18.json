Since CSV is a plain text format that can be easily imported into spreadsheet programs, I'll structure the data with columns for Year, Mode of Transport, and Description. I'll start with early forms of transportation and progress up to modern electric cars.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to compiling this timeline:\n\n1. **Research Key Milestones:** Identify significant developments in transportation history, from ancient times to the present day.\n\n2. **Organize Data:** Structure the information with Year, Mode of Transport, and a Brief Description for each entry.\n\n3. **Ensure Accuracy:** Verify dates and facts to maintain historical accuracy.\n\n4. **Format in CSV:** Present the data in a comma-separated values format.\n\nLet's begin by listing some key milestones:\n\n- **Animal-Drawn Vehicles:** These were among the earliest forms of transportation, using animals like horses, camels, and oxen.\n\n- **Wheeled Vehicles:** The invention of the wheel around 3500 BC was a pivotal moment.\n\n- **Sailing Ships:** Development of sailing technology for maritime transportation.\n\n- **Steam Engines:** Introduction in the 18th century, leading to steamboats and locomotives.\n\n- **Internal Combustion Engines:** Late 19th century, leading to automobiles and airplanes.\n\n- **Electric Cars:** Early 20th century, with recent advancements making them more prominent.\n\nNow, I'll expand on these points with specific years and descriptions.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a timeline of transportation development from animal-drawn vehicles to modern electric cars, we'll structure the data in CSV format with columns for Year, Mode of Transport, and a Brief Description. This format allows for easy importation into spreadsheet programs for further analysis or visualization.\n\n```csv\nYear,Mode of Transport,Brief Description\n3500 BC,Wheeled Vehicles,The invention of the wheel marks the beginning of organized land transportation, initially used in Mesopotamia.\n1500 BC,Horse-Drawn Chariots,Chariots become prominent in ancient civilizations for both warfare and transportation.\n1000 AD,Sailing Ships,Advancements in sailing technology enable longer maritime journeys, facilitating trade and exploration.\n1769,Steam Engine,James Watt's improvements to the steam engine pave the way for steam-powered transportation.\n1807,Steamboat,Nicholas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrates a steam-powered vehicle, and later, Robert Fulton develops the first commercially successful steamboat.\n1814,Locomotive,George Stephenson's \"Blucher\" is one of the first successful steam locomotives, leading to the development of railroads.\n1885,Internal Combustion Engine Car,Karl Benz patents the first automobile powered by an internal combustion engine.\n1901,Electric Tramways,Electric trams become popular for urban transportation, offering efficient and clean local travel.\n1908,Model T,Ford's Model T makes automobiles accessible to the general public, revolutionizing personal transportation.\n1914,Airplanes,The Wright brothers' first flight in 1903 leads to the development of commercial aviation by World War I.\n1950s,Jet Aircraft,The introduction of jet engines makes air travel faster and more efficient.\n1990s,High-Speed Rail,Countries like Japan and France develop high-speed rail networks, such as Shinkansen and TGV.\n2008,Tesla Roadster,Tesla introduces the Roadster, one of the first modern electric sports cars, signaling a new era in electric vehicle technology.\n2010s,Electric Cars,Mass-market electric cars like the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt become available, marking increased adoption of electric vehicles.\n2020s,Self-Driving Cars,Development of autonomous vehicle technology progresses, with companies testing self-driving cars on public roads.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Ancient Transportation (3500 BC - 1000 AD):**\n   - **Wheeled Vehicles (3500 BC):** The wheel's invention revolutionized land transportation.\n   - **Horse-Drawn Chariots (1500 BC):** Used in warfare and transportation in ancient civilizations.\n   - **Sailing Ships (1000 AD):** Advancements in sailing technology enabled longer maritime journeys.\n\n2. **Industrial Revolution (1769 - 1885):**\n   - **Steam Engine (1769):** James Watt's improvements led to various steam-powered applications.\n   - **Steamboat (1807):** Practical application of steam power for water transportation.\n   - **Locomotive (1814):** George Stephenson's innovations laid the foundation for rail transport.\n   - **Internal Combustion Engine Car (1885):** Karl Benz's patent marked the birth of the modern automobile.\n\n3. **20th Century Developments (1901 - 1990s):**\n   - **Electric Tramways (1901):** Provided efficient urban transportation.\n   - **Model T (1908):** Mass production made cars accessible to the general public.\n   - **Airplanes (1914):** The Wright brothers' innovations led to the development of commercial aviation.\n   - **Jet Aircraft (1950s):** Significantly increased air travel speed and efficiency.\n   - **High-Speed Rail (1990s):** High-speed trains like Shinkansen and TGV transformed land travel.\n\n4. **Modern Era (2008 - present):**\n   - **Tesla Roadster (2008):** Pioneered modern electric sports cars.\n   - **Mass-Market Electric Cars (2010s):** Widespread availability of electric vehicles like the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt.\n   - **Self-Driving Cars (2020s):** Ongoing development and testing of autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nThis timeline encapsulates the evolution of transportation, highlighting key inventions and their impacts on society and technology."
