Alright, let's dive into it.\n\nFirst off, what's a factorial? Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which equals 120.\n\nNow, recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem. So, for factorial, the recursive step would be n! = n \u00d7 (n-1)!.\n\nBut we need to stop somewhere, right? That's where the base case comes in. For factorial, the base case is when n is 0 or 1, and in both cases, the factorial is 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, here's how you can write a recursive function to calculate factorial in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction factorial(n) {\n    if (n === 0 || n === 1) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    return n * factorial(n - 1);\n}\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. We define a function called `factorial` that takes one parameter, `n`.\n\n2. Inside the function, we first check if `n` is 0 or 1. If it is, we return 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n\n3. If `n` is greater than 1, we return `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`. This is the recursive call where the function calls itself with a smaller value of n.\n\nFor example, if you call `factorial(5)`, here's what happens:\n\n- `factorial(5)` returns 5 * `factorial(4)`\n\n- `factorial(4)` returns 4 * `factorial(3)`\n\n- `factorial(3)` returns 3 * `factorial(2)`\n\n- `factorial(2)` returns 2 * `factorial(1)`\n\n- `factorial(1)` returns 1 (base case)\n\nSo, working backwards:\n\n- `factorial(2)` is 2 * 1 = 2\n\n- `factorial(3)` is 3 * 2 = 6\n\n- `factorial(4)` is 4 * 6 = 24\n\n- `factorial(5)` is 5 * 24 = 120\n\nThat's how recursion works for calculating factorial.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the depth of recursion is too high. In JavaScript, the maximum recursion depth is usually around 10,000 calls, but it can vary depending on the runtime environment. So for very large values of n, you might want to consider an iterative approach using loops to avoid hitting the recursion limit.\n\nBut for most practical purposes, especially for small to moderately large values of n, this recursive approach works just fine.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation."
