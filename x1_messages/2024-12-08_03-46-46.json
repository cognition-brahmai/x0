He then leaves to buy coffee for both of them. Meanwhile, an elderly lady sits down on the bench and accidentally covers the newspaper with her purse. Dean sees this but doesn't say anything. When Sam returns with the coffees, where does he think the newspaper is?"

While he's away, an elderly lady sits down on the bench and accidentally covers the newspaper with her purse. Dean sees this but doesn't say anything. Now, when Sam comes back with the coffees, he's probably going to look for his newspaper in the same place he left it, which is on the bench next to him. But since the elderly lady is sitting there with her purse covering it, Sam might think that the newspaper is still on the bench, under the lady's purse, or maybe he might not even notice that it's covered.\n\nAlternatively, if the lady's purse completely hides the newspaper from view, Sam might wonder where his newspaper has gone, thinking maybe he forgot to place it there or someone took it in his absence. But most likely, he would assume it's still on the bench, perhaps just obscured by the lady's purse.\n\nSo, in summary, Sam probably thinks the newspaper is still on the bench next to him, possibly under the elderly lady's purse."
