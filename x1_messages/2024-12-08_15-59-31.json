        "content": "The popular kitchen appliance you're referring to is the microwave oven. It was indeed invented by Percy Spencer in the 1940s and was originally called a \"Radarange.\" The invention came about somewhat accidentally when Spencer, an American engineer, noticed that microwave emissions from radar equipment were melting a chocolate bar in his pocket. This led him to experiment with microwaves for cooking purposes, eventually resulting in the development of the first microwave oven. The term \"Radarange\" combines \"radar\" and \"range,\" reflecting its origins in radar technology. Today, microwave ovens are a staple in kitchens around the world due to their efficiency in heating and cooking food quickly."
