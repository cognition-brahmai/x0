        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car rental company with 100 cars. On Monday, they rent out 75% of their cars. First, I need to figure out how many cars that is.\n\nTo find 75% of 100, I can calculate it as follows:\n75% of 100 = (75/100) * 100 = 75 cars\n\nSo, on Monday, they rent out 75 cars. Now, to find out how many cars are left after Monday, I subtract the rented cars from the total:\n\n100 cars - 75 cars = 25 cars remaining\n\nNext, on Tuesday, they rent out 60% of the remaining cars. So, I need to find 60% of those 25 cars.\n\n60% of 25 = (60/100) * 25 = 15 cars\n\nTherefore, on Tuesday, they rent out 15 more cars. Now, to find out how many cars are left unrented after Tuesday, I subtract the cars rented on Tuesday from the remaining cars after Monday:\n\n25 cars - 15 cars = 10 cars\n\nSo, after Tuesday, there are 10 cars left unrented.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with 100 cars, renting out 75% on Monday means 75 cars are rented, leaving 25. Then, renting out 60% of those remaining 25 on Tuesday means renting out 15 cars, which leaves 10 cars unrented.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the percentage of cars remaining after each day.\n\nAfter Monday, 25% of the cars are left because 100% - 75% = 25%. So, 25% of 100 cars is 25 cars.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, they rent out 60% of those remaining 25 cars, which is 15 cars, so 25 - 15 = 10 cars left.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the remaining percentage after both days.\n\nAfter Monday, 25% of the cars are left. Then, on Tuesday, they rent out 60% of those remaining, which means they rent out 60% of 25%, so that's 0.6 * 25% = 15% of the original number of cars.\n\nBut actually, that's not the precise way to think about it. Let's correct that.\n\nActually, after Monday, 25% of the cars are left. Then, on Tuesday, they rent out 60% of those remaining 25%. So, the percentage of cars rented on Tuesday is 60% of 25%, which is indeed 15% of the original total.\n\nTherefore, the total percentage of cars rented out is 75% on Monday plus 15% on Tuesday, which adds up to 90%. That means 10% of the original cars are left unrented.\n\nSince they started with 100 cars, 10% of 100 is indeed 10 cars.\n\nSo, my initial calculation is confirmed. There are 10 cars left unrented after Tuesday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
