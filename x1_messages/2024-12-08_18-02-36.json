        "content": "So the baker uses 3 eggs for each cake, and he has 36 eggs in total. I need to find out how many cakes he can make with those eggs.\n\nFirst, I should probably divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per cake. So, that's 36 eggs divided by 3 eggs per cake.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of cakes = total eggs / eggs per cake\n\nNumber of cakes = 36 / 3\n\nNow, 36 divided by 3 is 12. So, the baker can make 12 cakes with 36 eggs.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any eggs left over after making those cakes. Maybe there's a remainder.\n\nLet me see: 3 eggs per cake times 12 cakes is 36 eggs. So, 36 - 36 equals 0 eggs left over.\n\nSo, yes, he can make exactly 12 cakes with no eggs left over.\n\nAlternatively, if there were more eggs, say 37, then 37 divided by 3 is 12 with a remainder of 1 egg, which isn't enough to make another cake.\n\nBut in this case, with 36 eggs, it's exactly 12 cakes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
