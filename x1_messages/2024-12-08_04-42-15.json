San Francisco is famous for its regular fog, which is often attributed to its location near the Pacific Ocean and the cool marine layer that forms due to the upwelling of cold water along the coast. The fog in San Francisco can be quite dense and persistent, sometimes lasting for several days. Other cities known for their frequent fog include London, England; Dublin, Ireland; and Seattle, Washington, among others."
