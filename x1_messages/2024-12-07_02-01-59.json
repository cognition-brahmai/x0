        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The length is 15 feet and the width is 8 feet, and I need to find out the perimeter in feet. Okay, first things first, I need to remember what a perimeter is. The perimeter is the total distance around the edge of a shape. So, for a rectangle, that would be the sum of all its sides.\n\nNow, a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides: the lengths and the widths. So, there are two sides that are 15 feet each and two sides that are 8 feet each. To find the perimeter, I think I just need to add up all these sides together.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPerimeter = 15 feet + 15 feet + 8 feet + 8 feet\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, if I add those up:\n\n15 + 15 is 30 feet,\n\nand 8 + 8 is 16 feet.\n\nSo, 30 feet + 16 feet equals 46 feet.\n\nWait, but I recall there's a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. Is it P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width? Let me check if that gives me the same answer.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP = 2(15) + 2(8) = 30 + 16 = 46 feet.\n\nOkay, that matches what I did earlier by adding all the sides individually. So, that gives me more confidence that 46 feet is the correct perimeter.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there's another way to calculate this. Maybe there's a shortcut or another formula I could use.\n\nI remember that sometimes the perimeter formula is also written as P = 2(L + W). Let's try that with the given dimensions.\n\nP = 2(15 + 8) = 2(23) = 46 feet.\n\nAgain, the same result. So, no matter which formula I use, I end up with 46 feet as the perimeter.\n\nLet me double-check the units to make sure I'm consistent. The length and width are both given in feet, so the perimeter should indeed be in feet as well.\n\nIs there any other aspect to this problem I should consider? It's a straightforward rectangle with given length and width, and I'm just supposed to find the perimeter. I don't think there are any tricks or additional factors to account for.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should sketch the rectangle to visualize it.\n\n[Sketching a rectangle with length 15 feet and width 8 feet]\n\nSo, here's my rectangle. Length is 15 feet, width is 8 feet. If I go around the edge, starting from one corner: 15 feet to the next corner, then 8 feet up, then 15 feet back, and 8 feet down to where I started. Adding those up: 15 + 8 + 15 + 8 = 46 feet.\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods. Therefore, I can confidently say that the perimeter of the garden is 46 feet.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me consider if the garden had different dimensions. For example, if the length was 10 feet and the width was 5 feet, the perimeter would be 2(10) + 2(5) = 20 + 10 = 30 feet, or 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 30 feet. That makes sense. So, applying the same logic to the given dimensions should be correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The perimeter is indeed 46 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{46} \\]"
