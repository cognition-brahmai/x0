I'm not entirely sure which country it's in, but I'll take a guess. Maybe Mali? Yeah, I think Mali is the country where Timbuktu is located. It's in the northern part, right? I've heard about its rich history and all those manuscripts and libraries. It must have been a thriving center of learning in its time."
