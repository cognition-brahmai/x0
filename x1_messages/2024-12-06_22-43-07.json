        "content": "So the factory produces batches of widgets, and 25% of them are defective. That means that out of every 100 widgets they make, 25 are defective and 75 are non-defective.\n\nNow, a customer wants 200 non-defective widgets. But since only 75 out of every 100 widgets are good, the factory needs to produce more than 200 widgets to ensure that they have 200 non-defective ones.\n\nLet's think about this. If they produce X widgets, then 75% of X should be equal to 200 non-defective widgets because 75% are good.\n\nSo, 0.75 * X = 200\n\nTo find X, we can divide both sides by 0.75:\n\nX = 200 / 0.75\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n200 divided by 0.75 is the same as 200 multiplied by 4/3, which is 266.666...\n\nSince they can't produce a fraction of a widget, they need to round up to the next whole number. So, they need to produce 267 widgets to get at least 200 non-defective ones.\n\nBut let's check that.\n\nIf they produce 267 widgets, then 75% of 267 should be non-defective.\n\n0.75 * 267 = 200.25\n\nThat's more than 200, so it should be enough.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each batch contains 25% defective widgets. Does that mean that in every batch, exactly 25% are defective, or is it an average?\n\nAlso, it might be helpful to know the batch size. If they produce in batches, maybe they have to produce full batches.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the batch size, so maybe we can assume that they can produce any number of widgets, not necessarily in fixed-size batches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"batches\" here just means that the production is in some unspecified batch size, but we don't need to know the batch size to solve the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each batch contains 25% defective widgets.\" So, regardless of the batch size, 25% of each batch is defective.\n\nIf they produce multiple batches, the overall defect rate would still be 25%.\n\nSo, unless the batch size affects the answer, which it doesn't seem to, we can proceed as before.\n\nSo, they need to produce 267 widgets to get at least 200 non-defective ones.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many additional widgets they should produce beyond the 200 ordered.\n\nWait, no. It says \"how many additional widgets should the factory produce to ensure the customer receives 200 non-defective widgets?\"\n\nSo, if they need to produce 267 widgets to get 200 non-defective ones, then the additional widgets are 267 - 200 = 67.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because they are producing 267 widgets, of which 200 are non-defective, meaning 67 are defective.\n\nBut the customer only wants non-defective ones.\n\nWait, I think I misread the question.\n\nThey need to produce enough widgets so that after removing the defective ones, they have at least 200 non-defective widgets.\n\nSo, if they produce X widgets, then 75% of X should be at least 200.\n\nSo, 0.75 * X >= 200\n\nThen, X >= 200 / 0.75\n\nX >= 266.666...\n\nSo, X should be at least 267 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the additional widgets needed are 267 - 200 = 67 widgets.\n\nBut, to be safe, maybe they should produce more to account for any variations in the defect rate.\n\nBut according to the given information, producing 267 widgets should give them at least 200 non-defective ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a probability involved, and they want to be certain.\n\nBut the problem says \"to ensure,\" which implies they want to be certain.\n\nHowever, in reality, the defect rate might not be exactly 25%, but since the problem states that each batch contains 25% defective widgets, we can take that as a given.\n\nSo, the factory should produce 267 widgets to ensure the customer receives 200 non-defective widgets.\n\nTherefore, the additional widgets needed are 267 - 200 = 67 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{67} \\]"
