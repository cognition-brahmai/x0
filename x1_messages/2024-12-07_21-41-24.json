        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a company with 20 employees. The average salary of the first 10 employees is $40,000 per year, and the average salary of the remaining 10 employees is $60,000 per year. I need to find out the total annual salary expense for the company.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I know that average salary is calculated by taking the total salary expense and dividing it by the number of employees. So, if the average salary of the first 10 employees is $40,000, that means the total salary for those 10 employees is $40,000 multiplied by 10.\n\nSimilarly, the average salary of the remaining 10 employees is $60,000, so their total salary would be $60,000 multiplied by 10.\n\nThen, to find the total annual salary expense for the company, I just need to add those two totals together.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal salary for first 10 employees = 10 * $40,000\n\nTotal salary for remaining 10 employees = 10 * $60,000\n\nTotal annual salary expense = (10 * $40,000) + (10 * $60,000)\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\n10 * $40,000 = $400,000\n\n10 * $60,000 = $600,000\n\nSo, $400,000 + $600,000 = $1,000,000\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's any other factor I'm missing here. The problem doesn't mention any additional costs like benefits or taxes, so perhaps it's just asking for the total salary expenses, which would be the sum of all employees' salaries.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the average salary of all employees and then multiply by the number of employees to get the total expense. Let's see:\n\nAverage salary of all employees = (total salary expense) / (number of employees)\n\nBut I don't know the total salary expense yet; that's what I'm trying to find.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the combined average of the two groups.\n\nThe first group has 10 employees with an average salary of $40,000, and the second group has 10 employees with an average salary of $60,000.\n\nSince both groups have the same number of employees, the combined average would be the average of the two averages.\n\nSo, ($40,000 + $60,000) / 2 = $50,000\n\nThen, total salary expense would be $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier.\n\nBut is this the correct approach? I recall that sometimes averaging averages can be misleading, especially if the group sizes are different. However, in this case, both groups have the same number of employees, so it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, to be more precise, I can use the formula for the weighted average.\n\nThe weighted average salary would be:\n\n(total salary of all employees) / (total number of employees)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n((sum of salaries of first 10 employees) + (sum of salaries of remaining 10 employees)) / 20\n\nWe already calculated the sum for each group:\n\nFirst 10: $400,000\n\nRemaining 10: $600,000\n\nSo, total salary = $400,000 + $600,000 = $1,000,000\n\nThen, average salary = $1,000,000 / 20 = $50,000\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the total salary expense directly, without finding the average first, I would still end up with the same total of $1,000,000.\n\nI think I'm convincing myself that $1,000,000 is the correct total annual salary expense for the company.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe the \"first 10 employees\" and \"remaining 10 employees\" refer to different roles or hierarchical levels, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I think it's safe to assume that these are just two groups of employees with different average salaries.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"average salary,\" which typically includes only the base salary and doesn't account for bonuses, benefits, or other forms of compensation. Since the problem doesn't mention any additional compensation, I think it's reasonable to consider only the salary figures provided.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether salaries are distributed uniformly within each group. For example, do all employees in the first group earn exactly $40,000, and all in the second group earn exactly $60,000? Or are there variations within each group?\n\nActually, the average salary being $40,000 for the first group means that some employees could earn more and some less, as long as the average is $40,000. Similarly for the second group with an average of $60,000.\n\nBut since the problem provides average salaries and the number of employees in each group, I don't need to know the individual salaries to calculate the total salary expense. The total is simply the sum of the products of average salary and the number of employees in each group.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial calculation:\n\nTotal salary expense = (10 * $40,000) + (10 * $60,000) = $400,000 + $600,000 = $1,000,000\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Perhaps the \"first 10 employees\" and \"remaining 10 employees\" are not distinct groups, or maybe there's overlapping data.\n\nNo, the problem clearly states that there are 20 employees in total, with the first 10 having an average salary of $40,000 and the remaining 10 having an average of $60,000. So, it's two separate groups that together make up all 20 employees.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that the overall average is $50,000, but with different group sizes, but in this case, the group sizes are equal, so it's not a trap.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and the total annual salary expense for the company is $1,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000000} \\]"
