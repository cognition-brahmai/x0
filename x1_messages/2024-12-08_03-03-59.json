        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples in bags, and each bag contains 6 apples. They sell 100 bags per day. I need to find out how many individual apples they sell in one week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many apples are sold per day. Since each bag has 6 apples and they sell 100 bags per day, I can multiply 6 by 100 to get the daily apple sales.\n\nSo, 6 apples/bag \u00d7 100 bags/day = 600 apples/day.\n\nNow, to find out how many apples are sold in one week, I need to know how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nTherefore, 600 apples/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 4200 apples/week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If they sell 100 bags per day, and each bag has 6 apples, then daily sales are indeed 600 apples. And over 7 days, that would be 4200 apples.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of apples sold in a week is the number of bags sold in a week multiplied by the number of apples per bag.\n\nSo, bags per week would be 100 bags/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 700 bags/week.\n\nThen, 700 bags/week \u00d7 6 apples/bag = 4200 apples/week.\n\nEither way, I end up with 4200 apples per week.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the store sells 4200 individual apples in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4200} \\]"
