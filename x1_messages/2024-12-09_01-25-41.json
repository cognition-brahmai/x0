Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Allows the user to search for information using DuckDuckGo search engine. This tool finds a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and outputs plain text containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkHarvester[input]: Extracts hyperlinks from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nInfoAI[input]: A question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n#E0 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context #E0\"]\n...\nFinal answer: #E[n]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the telephone and when was the first successful call made?"
