        "content": "So I've got this problem here about chocolates. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere are 40 chocolates in total in the box. Out of these, 18 are milk chocolate, and 12 are dark chocolate. The rest are white chocolate, and I need to find out how many are white chocolate.\n\nAlright, so first, I should probably figure out how many chocolates are not white. That would be the milk and dark chocolates combined.\n\nSo, milk chocolates are 18, and dark chocolates are 12. Let's add those together:\n\n18 + 12 = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 chocolates that are either milk or dark.\n\nNow, the total number of chocolates is 40. So, to find the number of white chocolates, I can subtract the number of milk and dark chocolates from the total.\n\nThat is:\n\nTotal chocolates - (milk chocolates + dark chocolates) = white chocolates\n\nSo, 40 - 30 = 10\n\nTherefore, there are 10 white chocolates in the box.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way could be to set up an equation. Let\u2019s let W represent the number of white chocolates.\n\nWe know that:\n\nNumber of milk chocolates + number of dark chocolates + number of white chocolates = total chocolates\n\nSo,\n\n18 + 12 + W = 40\n\nCombining the known values:\n\n30 + W = 40\n\nNow, solving for W:\n\nW = 40 - 30\n\nW = 10\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems like there are 10 white chocolates.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check if the numbers make sense.\n\nTotal chocolates: 40\n\nMilk: 18\n\nDark: 12\n\nWhite: 10\n\nAdding them up: 18 + 12 + 10 = 40\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of percentages, but that might not be necessary for this problem since we're just looking for the number of white chocolates.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 10 white chocolates in the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
