The process of mapping a sentence to a logical form.\n\nTo elaborate, semantic parsing is a technique that involves understanding the meaning behind natural language expressions and representing them in a formal language that can be processed by computers. This formal representation, often called a logical form, captures the semantic structure of the sentence, making it possible for machines to reason about the meaning and perform tasks such as question answering, information extraction, and dialogue systems.\n\nFor example, consider the sentence \"Find flights from New York to San Francisco.\" Semantic parsing would involve analyzing this sentence to understand that the user is seeking information about flights, specifying the origin as New York and the destination as San Francisco. This understanding is then represented in a logical form that a computer can interpret and act upon, such as querying a database for flight information between these two cities.\n\nSemantic parsing is a crucial component in building systems that can effectively communicate with humans using natural language, as it bridges the gap between human expression and machine understanding."
