        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, first, let's understand what a factorial is. Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNow, to calculate the factorial using recursion in Python, we need to define a function that calls itself with a smaller number until it reaches the base case. The base case for factorial is when n is 0 or 1, and in both cases, the factorial is 1.\n\nHere's a simple Python script that does that:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Taking input from the user\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\nif num < 0:\n    print(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}\")\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function called `factorial` that takes one parameter, `n`.\n\n2. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n\n3. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`. This is where the recursion happens. The function calls itself with `n - 1`.\n\n4. **User Input**: We take input from the user and convert it to an integer.\n\n5. **Check for Negative Numbers**: Since factorial is not defined for negative numbers, we check if the input is negative. If it is, we print an error message. Otherwise, we calculate the factorial using the `factorial` function and print the result.\n\nThis script is straightforward and demonstrates the concept of recursion effectively. Recursion can be a bit tricky to grasp at first, but once you understand the base case and how the function calls itself with a smaller problem, it becomes clearer.\n\nOne thing to be cautious about with recursion is the risk of hitting the maximum recursion depth, especially for large input numbers. Python has a default recursion limit, and if you try to compute the factorial of a very large number, you might encounter a `RecursionError`. For such cases, an iterative approach using loops is preferable.\n\nBut for the purpose of understanding recursion, this script is perfect. Give it a try and let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!\n\n**Additional Resource:**\n\n- [Python Documentation on Defining Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)\n\n**Exercise:**\n\nTry modifying the script to handle negative numbers by asking the user to enter a non-negative number again instead of just displaying an error message.\n\n**Hint:**\n\nYou can use a loop to keep asking for input until a non-negative number is entered."
