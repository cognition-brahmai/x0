        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: A car has 5 tires, including the spare, and each tire has a lifespan of 50,000 miles. The question is, how many miles can the car travel before all tires, including the spare, have been worn out, assuming each tire is used equally.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 5 tires in total, and each can last 50,000 miles. But the car only uses 4 tires at a time, right? So, somehow, we need to rotate them so that all 5 tires get equal usage.\n\nI think the key here is to make sure that each tire is used equally, meaning each tire is used for the same number of miles. Since there are 5 tires but only 4 are on the car at any given time, we need to figure out how to distribute the mileage among them.\n\nLet me try to think about it this way: If the car travels a certain number of miles, and in that time, each tire is used for a portion of that distance, then the total mileage of all tires used should equal the total lifespan of the tires.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the total available tire mileage. Each tire has 50,000 miles, and there are 5 tires, so total available mileage is 5 * 50,000 = 250,000 miles.\n\nBut, the car only uses 4 tires at a time, so the total mileage the car can travel is the total available tire mileage divided by the number of tires in use. That would be 250,000 miles / 4 = 62,500 miles.\n\nWait a second, does that make sense? Let's check.\n\nIf the car travels 62,500 miles, and each of the 5 tires is used equally, then each tire is used for (4/5)*62,500 miles, because only 4 out of 5 tires are in use at any time.\n\nLet me calculate that: (4/5)*62,500 = 50,000 miles per tire. That matches the lifespan of each tire.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. The car can travel 62,500 miles before all tires have been worn out, assuming each tire is used equally.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of tire-miles. Each tire can provide 50,000 miles of service. With 5 tires, that's 250,000 tire-miles available. Since the car uses 4 tires at a time, the total miles the car can travel is 250,000 / 4 = 62,500 miles.\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Suppose we have 5 tires: A, B, C, D, and E. We need to rotate them in such a way that each tire is used equally.\n\nOne rotation scheme could be to rotate the tires regularly, say every 12,500 miles. So, after every 12,500 miles, switch one tire with the spare.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Miles 0-12,500: Tires A, B, C, D are used.\n\n- Miles 12,500-25,000: Tires A, B, C, E are used.\n\n- Miles 25,000-37,500: Tires A, B, D, E are used.\n\n- Miles 37,500-50,000: Tires A, C, D, E are used.\n\n- Miles 50,000-62,500: Tires B, C, D, E are used.\n\nWait, but in this scheme, each tire is used for 4 intervals of 12,500 miles, which totals 50,000 miles per tire.\n\n- Tire A: Miles 0-25,000 (first two intervals)\n\n- Tire B: Miles 0-37,500 (first three intervals)\n\n- Tire C: Miles 0-50,000 (first four intervals)\n\n- Tire D: Miles 0-62,500 (all five intervals)\n\n- Tire E: Miles 12,500-62,500 (last four intervals)\n\nHmm, actually, this rotation isn't equal. Tire D is used for the entire 62,500 miles, which is more than the others.\n\nLet me try to think of a better rotation scheme.\n\nPerhaps, at each rotation, we replace one tire, so that each tire is used for the same number of miles.\n\nLet's say we rotate the tires every 12,500 miles, and each time, we switch one tire with the spare.\n\nSo:\n\n- Miles 0-12,500: Tires A, B, C, D\n\n- Miles 12,500-25,000: Tires A, B, C, E\n\n- Miles 25,000-37,500: Tires A, B, D, E\n\n- Miles 37,500-50,000: Tires A, C, D, E\n\n- Miles 50,000-62,500: Tires B, C, D, E\n\nNow, let's calculate the total miles each tire is used:\n\n- Tire A: Miles 0-37,500 (first three intervals)\n\n- Tire B: Miles 0-50,000 (first four intervals)\n\n- Tire C: Miles 0-62,500 (all five intervals)\n\n- Tire D: Miles 0-62,500 (all five intervals)\n\n- Tire E: Miles 12,500-62,500 (last four intervals)\n\nWait, this still doesn't result in each tire being used equally. Tire C and Tire D are used for the entire 62,500 miles, which is more than the others.\n\nI must be missing something here. Maybe a different rotation scheme is needed.\n\nLet me consider a rotation where each tire is used for exactly 50,000 miles over the course of 62,500 miles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of fractions.\n\nIf there are 5 tires and only 4 are used at a time, then each tire is used for 4/5 of the total distance traveled.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since only 4 tires are in use at any time, the total tire-miles used is 4 times the distance traveled.\n\nSo, if the car travels D miles, then the total tire-miles used is 4D.\n\nBut we have 5 tires, each with a lifespan of 50,000 miles, so the total available tire-miles is 5 * 50,000 = 250,000 miles.\n\nTherefore, 4D = 250,000, so D = 250,000 / 4 = 62,500 miles.\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, each tire is used for a fraction of the total distance, and since there are 5 tires but only 4 in use at a time, each tire is used for 4/5 of the total distance.\n\nWait, no. If each tire is used equally, then the total mileage per tire is (4/5)*D.\n\nAnd we know that each tire can last 50,000 miles, so (4/5)*D = 50,000.\n\nTherefore, D = 50,000 * (5/4) = 62,500 miles.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently. Suppose the car travels D miles, and each tire is used equally. Let\u2019s denote the mileage per tire as M.\n\nSince there are 5 tires and each is used equally, the total tire-miles used is 5*M.\n\nBut also, since only 4 tires are in use at any time, the total tire-miles used is also equal to 4*D.\n\nTherefore, 5*M = 4*D.\n\nBut we know that M = 50,000 miles, so:\n\n5*50,000 = 4*D => 250,000 = 4*D => D = 62,500 miles.\n\nYet again, the same answer.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. All these approaches lead to the same conclusion: The car can travel 62,500 miles before all tires have been worn out, assuming each tire is used equally.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe considering that the spare tire is only used when one of the regular tires is flat, but the problem says \"each tire is used equally,\" so I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that the spare tire is not always available for rotation, but the problem includes it as part of the 5 tires, so it's fair to include it in the rotation.\n\nWait, maybe another way to look at it is to calculate how much each tire is used per mile.\n\nIf there are 5 tires and only 4 are used at a time, then each tire is used for 4/5 of the total distance.\n\nSo, if the car travels D miles, each tire is used for (4/5)*D miles.\n\nGiven that each tire has a lifespan of 50,000 miles:\n\n(4/5)*D = 50,000 => D = 50,000*(5/4) = 62,500 miles.\n\nSame result again.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the car can travel 62,500 miles before all tires, including the spare, have been worn out, assuming each tire is used equally.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62500} \\]"
