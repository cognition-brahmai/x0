        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and we're given some information about its dimensions and perimeter. The problem says that the length is 3 meters more than twice its width, and the perimeter is 36 meters. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find both the length and the width of the garden.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter (P) is given by:\n\n\\[ P = 2L + 2W \\]\n\nwhere \\(L\\) is the length and \\(W\\) is the width of the rectangle.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the perimeter is 36 meters, so we can write:\n\n\\[ 2L + 2W = 36 \\]\n\nBut we also have another piece of information: the length is 3 meters more than twice the width. That can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ L = 2W + 3 \\]\n\nSo now, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( 2L + 2W = 36 \\)\n\n2. \\( L = 2W + 3 \\)\n\nThis looks like a job for substitution! Since we already have \\(L\\) in terms of \\(W\\) from the second equation, we can substitute that into the first equation to solve for \\(W\\).\n\nLet's do that:\n\n\\[ 2(2W + 3) + 2W = 36 \\]\n\nNow, distribute the 2:\n\n\\[ 4W + 6 + 2W = 36 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 6W + 6 = 36 \\]\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 6W = 30 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n\\[ W = 5 \\]\n\nOkay, so the width is 5 meters. Now, we can use the second equation to find the length:\n\n\\[ L = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \\]\n\nSo, the length is 13 meters.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. We can plug these values back into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ 2(13) + 2(5) = 26 + 10 = 36 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the given perimeter. Also, checking the relationship between length and width:\n\nIs 13 equal to twice the width (which is 10) plus 3? Yes, 10 + 3 is 13. Perfect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. For example, could we have used the area or some other property of the rectangle? Well, the problem doesn't give us the area, so that probably wouldn't help. We only have information about the perimeter and the relationship between length and width.\n\nAnother thought: since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, which is already accounted for in the perimeter formula. So, I think the approach we took is the most straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's a way to solve this using geometry alone, without algebra. Hmmm.\n\nImagine we have a rectangle. If we know that the length is 3 meters more than twice the width, maybe we can visualize this.\n\nLet's say the width is \\(W\\). Then the length is \\(2W + 3\\).\n\nThe perimeter is the sum of all sides, which is \\(2L + 2W = 36\\).\n\nWait, that's back to the same equation we started with. It seems algebra is the way to go here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can solve this using ratios or something, but again, that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nI think our initial approach is solid. We found that the width is 5 meters and the length is 13 meters, and verified that these values satisfy both the perimeter condition and the relationship between length and width.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of multiple solutions. Given that we have a system of linear equations, and they are not dependent or contradictory, there should be exactly one solution. So, we can be confident that 5 meters for width and 13 meters for length is the only correct answer.\n\nIn real life, maybe we could also consider if negative dimensions are possible, but of course, width and length can't be negative in reality. So, any negative solutions would be invalid.\n\nWait, let's check if our equations could yield negative solutions. From \\(6W = 30\\), \\(W = 5\\), which is positive, and then \\(L = 13\\), also positive. So, no issue there.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem were set up differently, we might have to discard negative solutions, but in this case, it's not an issue.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps we could use graphical methods to solve this. If we graph both equations, their intersection point would give us the solution.\n\nThe first equation, \\(2L + 2W = 36\\), can be simplified to \\(L + W = 18\\), or \\(L = 18 - W\\).\n\nThe second equation is \\(L = 2W + 3\\).\n\nSo, plotting these two lines, their intersection would give us the values of \\(L\\) and \\(W\\).\n\nSetting \\(18 - W = 2W + 3\\), solving for \\(W\\), we get:\n\n\\[ 18 - 3 = 2W + W \\]\n\n\\[ 15 = 3W \\]\n\n\\[ W = 5 \\]\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, multiple methods lead us to the same conclusion.\n\nIn teaching this problem, it's important to emphasize understanding the relationships between the variables and translating the word problem into mathematical equations. Also, checking the solutions by plugging them back into the original conditions ensures accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, encouraging students to visualize the problem can help in grasping the concepts better. For instance, drawing a rectangle and labeling its sides with the given relationships can make it easier to see how the perimeter is calculated.\n\nIn summary, the dimensions of the garden are:\n\n- Width: 5 meters\n\n- Length: 13 meters\n\nAnd we've confirmed this through algebraic manipulation and alternative methods, ensuring the solution is correct."
