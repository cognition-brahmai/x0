        "content": "So Alice can paint a house in 5 hours, and Bob can do it in 7 hours. We want to know how long it would take for them to paint the house together. Hmm, this seems like a problem about working together and combining rates.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how much each of them can paint per hour. That sounds like their painting rates. So, Alice's rate would be 1 house per 5 hours, which is 1/5 of a house per hour. Similarly, Bob's rate is 1 house per 7 hours, or 1/7 of a house per hour.\n\nNow, if they work together, their rates should add up. So, the combined rate would be Alice's rate plus Bob's rate. That is, 1/5 plus 1/7. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 7 is 35. So, 1/5 is 7/35, and 1/7 is 5/35. Adding them up gives 7/35 + 5/35 = 12/35. So, together, they can paint 12/35 of a house per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes for them to paint one whole house, I need to divide the total work (which is 1 house) by their combined rate (12/35 house per hour). So, time = work/rate = 1 / (12/35) = 35/12 hours.\n\nLet me calculate 35 divided by 12. 12 times 2 is 24, which leaves a remainder of 11. So, it's 2 and 11/12 hours. Alternatively, I can convert this to hours and minutes. Since 11/12 of an hour is 55 minutes (because 60 minutes times 11/12 is 55 minutes), the total time is 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. 12 times 2 is 24, and 35 minus 24 is 11, so yes, 35/12 is 2 and 11/12 hours. And 11/12 of an hour is indeed 55 minutes.\n\nSo, Alice and Bob together can paint the house in 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer? Maybe using the formula for combined work rates. I recall that if two people work together, the time taken is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of their individual reciprocals. In other words, if person A can do a job in a hours and person B can do it in b hours, the time t taken together is given by 1/t = 1/a + 1/b.\n\nIn this case, a = 5 hours and b = 7 hours. So, 1/t = 1/5 + 1/7. We already calculated that 1/5 + 1/7 = 12/35, so t = 35/12 hours, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a method where you multiply the two times and divide by their sum. So, t = (a * b) / (a + b). Let's try that: t = (5 * 7) / (5 + 7) = 35 / 12 hours, which again is the same answer.\n\nAlright, it seems like no matter which method I use, I get 35/12 hours, or 2 hours and 55 minutes. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we should account for, like if their painting speeds change over time or if there's any overlap in their work. But based on the problem, it seems like they are painting the house together simultaneously, and there's no information suggesting that their rates change or that there's any inefficiency from working together.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that Alice and Bob can paint the house together in 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{35}{12} \\text{ hours}} \\]"
