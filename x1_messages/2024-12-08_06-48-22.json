However, I can tell you that many people enjoy the refreshing sensation of holding a cold beverage, especially on a hot day. The coolness of the glass can provide a pleasant contrast to the warmth of one's hand, and the slight condensation that forms on the outside of the glass can add to the overall sensory experience."
