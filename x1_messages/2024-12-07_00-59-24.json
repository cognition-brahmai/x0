Instead, it stores fat, which can be metabolized for energy when food is scarce. This adaptation allows camels to go for long periods without eating in the harsh desert environment. The fat in the hump also helps insulate the camel from the heat. Camels do have the ability to conserve water efficiently, but the water is stored in their bloodstream and other body tissues, not in their humps."
