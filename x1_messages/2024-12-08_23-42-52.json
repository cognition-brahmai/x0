        "content": "So Tom reads 20 pages in 30 minutes. I need to find out how long it will take him to read a 200-page book at the same pace. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out his reading rate. If he reads 20 pages in 30 minutes, that means his rate is 20 pages per 30 minutes. To make it easier, maybe I can find out how many pages he reads per minute.\n\nSo, pages per minute would be 20 pages divided by 30 minutes. That is:\n\n20 pages / 30 minutes = 2/3 pages per minute.\n\nWait, that seems a bit slow. Maybe I should think of it in terms of minutes per page.\n\nIf he reads 20 pages in 30 minutes, then the time per page is 30 minutes divided by 20 pages, which is:\n\n30 minutes / 20 pages = 1.5 minutes per page.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, he takes 1.5 minutes to read each page.\n\nNow, if the book has 200 pages, and he takes 1.5 minutes per page, then the total time would be:\n\n200 pages * 1.5 minutes per page = 300 minutes.\n\nSo, it would take him 300 minutes to read the entire book.\n\nBut, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using proportions.\n\nIf 20 pages take 30 minutes, then 200 pages would take x minutes. So, I can set up a proportion:\n\n20 pages / 30 minutes = 200 pages / x minutes.\n\nNow, cross-multiplying:\n\n20 * x = 30 * 200\n\n20x = 6000\n\nNow, divide both sides by 20:\n\nx = 6000 / 20\n\nx = 300 minutes.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut, maybe I can convert this time into hours and minutes to make it more understandable.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n300 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours.\n\nSo, it will take him 5 hours to read the 200-page book.\n\nLet me just double-check.\n\nIf he reads 20 pages in 30 minutes, that's half an hour. So, in one hour, he would read 40 pages.\n\nTherefore, for 200 pages:\n\n200 pages \u00f7 40 pages per hour = 5 hours.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider his reading rate in pages per minute, which was 2/3 pages per minute, then for 200 pages:\n\nTime = total pages / rate\n\nTime = 200 / (2/3) = 200 * (3/2) = 300 minutes, or 5 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
