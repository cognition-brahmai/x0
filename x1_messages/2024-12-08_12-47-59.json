        "content": "Let's see. Alice bought 5 fruits in total, and she spent exactly $7. The store sells apples for $1 each and oranges for $2 each. I need to figure out how many oranges she bought.\n\nFirst, I should probably set up some equations based on the information given. Let's say:\n\n- Let A be the number of apples Alice bought.\n\n- Let O be the number of oranges Alice bought.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that:\n\n1. The total number of fruits is 5, so A + O = 5.\n\n2. The total cost is $7, and since apples cost $1 each and oranges cost $2 each, the equation for the total cost would be 1A + 2O = 7.\n\nSo, I have two equations:\n\nA + O = 5\n\nA + 2O = 7\n\nNow, I need to solve these equations to find the value of O, which is the number of oranges.\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate A:\n\n(A + 2O) - (A + O) = 7 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nA + 2O - A - O = 2\n\nWhich further simplifies to:\n\nO = 2\n\nSo, Alice bought 2 oranges.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. If she bought 2 oranges, that would cost 2 * $2 = $4. Since she bought 5 fruits in total, the remaining 3 fruits would be apples, costing 3 * $1 = $3. So, total cost would be $4 + $3 = $7, which matches the given total.\n\nAlright, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used substitution. From the first equation, A = 5 - O. Then plug this into the second equation:\n\n(5 - O) + 2O = 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n5 - O + 2O = 7\n\n5 + O = 7\n\nThen, O = 7 - 5 = 2\n\nAgain, O = 2.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I get that Alice bought 2 oranges.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
