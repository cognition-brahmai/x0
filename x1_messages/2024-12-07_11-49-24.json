        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the online retailer wants to expand its warehouse capacity because there's more demand for their products. Right now, their warehouse can hold 100,000 cubic feet of stuff. They plan to increase that by 50%. Each pallet they store takes up 8 cubic feet, and they need to find space for an additional 5,000 pallets. We need to figure out if, after expanding, the warehouse will have enough space for these extra pallets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the current situation is and what the expansion will look like. The current storage capacity is 100,000 cubic feet. They want to increase that by 50%. So, I need to calculate what 50% of 100,000 is and then add that to the current capacity to find out the new total capacity.\n\nLet me calculate 50% of 100,000:\n\n50% of 100,000 = 0.5 * 100,000 = 50,000 cubic feet.\n\nSo, the expansion will add 50,000 cubic feet to the current capacity. Therefore, the new total capacity will be:\n\n100,000 + 50,000 = 150,000 cubic feet.\n\nNow, each pallet occupies 8 cubic feet, and they need to store an additional 5,000 pallets. So, I need to find out how much space these additional pallets will require.\n\nSpace needed for 5,000 pallets = 5,000 pallets * 8 cubic feet per pallet = 40,000 cubic feet.\n\nSo, the additional pallets will require 40,000 cubic feet of space.\n\nNow, I need to see if the expanded warehouse can accommodate this additional space required.\n\nThe expanded warehouse has a total capacity of 150,000 cubic feet. But, we need to consider whether this is in addition to the current storage or if it's the total capacity after expansion. Wait a minute, the problem says they want to increase the capacity by 50%, which means the new total capacity will be 150,000 cubic feet, as I calculated earlier.\n\nHowever, we need to consider if the current pallets are already occupying the warehouse space. The problem doesn't specify how much of the current capacity is being used, so I might need to assume that the warehouse is currently full or that it's not fully utilized.\n\nWait, the problem says they \"need to store an additional 5,000 pallets.\" It doesn't specify if the warehouse is currently storing any pallets or how much space is already being used. For the sake of this problem, I think we can assume that the current warehouse is already full, and they need to expand to store more pallets.\n\nSo, if the current warehouse is full at 100,000 cubic feet, and they expand to 150,000 cubic feet, that means they have an additional 50,000 cubic feet of space.\n\nNow, the additional pallets require 40,000 cubic feet of space, as calculated earlier.\n\nComparing the additional space required (40,000 cubic feet) with the additional space available (50,000 cubic feet), it seems that the expanded warehouse can accommodate the additional pallets, since 40,000 is less than 50,000.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this reasoning. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nFirst, confirm the expansion: 100,000 cubic feet + 50% of 100,000 = 150,000 cubic feet. That seems correct.\n\nNext, space required for additional pallets: 5,000 pallets * 8 cubic feet per pallet = 40,000 cubic feet. That also seems correct.\n\nNow, comparing the additional space required (40,000 cubic feet) with the additional space provided by the expansion (50,000 cubic feet), it appears that the warehouse will have enough space.\n\nIn fact, after accommodating the additional 5,000 pallets, there would still be some space left in the expanded warehouse.\n\nLet me calculate the remaining space after storing the additional pallets:\n\nAdditional space available: 50,000 cubic feet\n\nSpace needed for additional pallets: 40,000 cubic feet\n\nRemaining space: 50,000 - 40,000 = 10,000 cubic feet.\n\nSo, even after storing the additional 5,000 pallets, there will still be 10,000 cubic feet of space left in the expanded warehouse.\n\nTherefore, yes, the expanded warehouse will be able to accommodate the additional pallets.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I should consider if the current warehouse is already storing some pallets, and how that affects the total number of pallets that can be stored after expansion.\n\nLet's think about it differently. Suppose the current warehouse is storing some pallets already. We need to find out how many pallets it can currently hold and how many it can hold after expansion.\n\nFirst, find out how many pallets the current warehouse can hold.\n\nCurrent capacity: 100,000 cubic feet\n\nEach pallet: 8 cubic feet\n\nNumber of pallets current warehouse can hold: 100,000 / 8 = 12,500 pallets.\n\nAfter expansion, total capacity: 150,000 cubic feet\n\nNumber of pallets the expanded warehouse can hold: 150,000 / 8 = 18,750 palletes.\n\nAdditional pallets needed: 5,000 pallets.\n\nSo, if the current warehouse can hold 12,500 pallets, and the expanded warehouse can hold 18,750 pallets, the difference is indeed 6,250 pallets (18,750 - 12,500 = 6,250).\n\nBut the company only needs to store an additional 5,000 pallets, which is less than the additional capacity of 6,250 pallets.\n\nTherefore, the expanded warehouse can accommodate the additional 5,000 pallets with room to spare.\n\nThis confirms the earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the expansion provides an additional 50,000 cubic feet, which can hold 50,000 / 8 = 6,250 pallets, which again is more than the required 5,000 pallets.\n\nSo, in both approaches, we reach the same conclusion that the expanded warehouse will be able to accommodate the additional pallets.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the expanded warehouse will be able to accommodate the additional 5,000 pallets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, the expanded warehouse will be able to accommodate the additional pallets.}} \\]"
