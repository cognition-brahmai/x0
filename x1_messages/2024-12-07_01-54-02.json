        "content": "Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation given is:\n\n3x - 7 = 2(x - 4) + 1\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the right side of the equation. There's a 2 being multiplied by (x - 4), so I'll distribute the 2 to both x and -4.\n\n2 * x = 2x\n\n2 * (-4) = -8\n\nSo, 2(x - 4) becomes 2x - 8.\n\nNow, the equation looks like:\n\n3x - 7 = 2x - 8 + 1\n\nNext, I'll combine the constants on the right side: -8 + 1 equals -7.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n3x - 7 = 2x - 7\n\nNow, I need to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other side. I can start by subtracting 2x from both sides to eliminate x from the right side.\n\n3x - 2x - 7 = 2x - 2x - 7\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx - 7 = -7\n\nNext, I'll add 7 to both sides to isolate x.\n\nx - 7 + 7 = -7 + 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is x = 0.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct by plugging x = 0 back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n3x - 7 = 2(x - 4) + 1\n\nPlugging x = 0:\n\n3(0) - 7 = 2(0 - 4) + 1\n\n0 - 7 = 2(-4) + 1\n\n-7 = -8 + 1\n\n-7 = -7\n\nYes, both sides are equal, so x = 0 is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
