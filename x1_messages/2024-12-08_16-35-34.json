        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability of picking exactly 2 red balls when I draw three balls without replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to pick without replacement. That means once I pick a ball, it stays out, and doesn't go back into the box. So, the total number of balls decreases with each pick.\n\nNow, the total number of ways to pick 3 balls out of 10 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 10 is C(10, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that: C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to pick any 3 balls from the box.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to pick exactly 2 red balls. There are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls.\n\nTo pick exactly 2 red balls, I need to choose 2 red balls out of 4 and 1 blue ball out of 6.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 4 is C(4, 2), and the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball from 6 is C(6, 1).\n\nLet me calculate these:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 2 * 1) = (24) / (4) = 6.\n\nC(6, 1) = 6! / (1! * 5!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 120) = 6.\n\nSo, the number of ways to pick exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball is C(4, 2) * C(6, 1) = 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability = number of ways to pick exactly 2 red balls / total number of ways to pick 3 balls = 36 / 120.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction: 36 / 120 = 3 / 10 = 0.3.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking exactly 2 red balls is 0.3, or 30%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the problem in terms of sequences. For example, the sequence could be red, red, blue; or red, blue, red; or blue, red, red.\n\nEach of these sequences has the same probability, and there are 3 such sequences.\n\nLet me calculate the probability for one sequence and then multiply by 3.\n\nTake the sequence red, red, blue.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is 4/10.\n\nThen, without replacement, there are now 3 red balls and 6 blue balls left, total 9 balls.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is 3/9.\n\nThen, picking a blue ball next is 6/8.\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is (4/10) * (3/9) * (6/8).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 4/10 = 0.4\n\nThen, 3/9 = 0.333...\n\nThen, 6/8 = 0.75\n\nMultiplying these together: 0.4 * 0.333... * 0.75 = ?\n\nWait, it's easier to multiply the fractions directly:\n\n(4/10) * (3/9) * (6/8) = (4 * 3 * 6) / (10 * 9 * 8) = 72 / 720 = 0.1.\n\nSo, the probability for one specific sequence is 0.1.\n\nSince there are 3 such sequences, the total probability is 3 * 0.1 = 0.3, or 30%.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation using combinations.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the binomial coefficient formula for hypergeometric distribution, since we're sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (10 balls)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (4 red balls)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red balls)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(2) = [C(4, 2) * C(6, 1)] / C(10, 3) = (6 * 6) / 120 = 36 / 120 = 0.3\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider another approach.\n\nWe could also think about the problem in terms of permutations.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick 3 balls out of 10 without replacement is 10 P 3 = 10! / (10 - 3)! = 10 * 9 * 8 = 720.\n\nBut wait, that's permutations, where order matters.\n\nIn my earlier sequence approach, I considered order, and I had to account for all possible sequences that result in 2 red and 1 blue.\n\nAlternatively, if I use permutations, the number of favorable permutations would be:\n\nNumber of ways to arrange 2 red and 1 blue in sequence: C(3, 2) * (4 P 2) * (6 P 1)\n\nWait, that seems complicated.\n\nActually, it's easier to stick with combinations because order doesn't matter in this problem.\n\nThe problem is about the combination of balls, not the order in which they are picked.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach using combinations is the most straightforward and accurate.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 36 / 120 = 0.3, or 30%.\n\nI feel confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.3} \\]"
