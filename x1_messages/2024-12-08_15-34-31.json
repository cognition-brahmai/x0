ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN, CNN HOST: Getting air. Take a look, a buckled highway sends an unsuspecting driver flying through the air. BANFIELD: And a couple of kids try to snatch the Olympic torch. Are you kidding? Seriously? Way to go, kids. There you go. SAMBOLIN: They were excited. BANFIELD: Not a funny trick and he runs away waving. All is good in torch land. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to EARLY START. I\\'m Ashleigh Banfield. SAMBOLIN: And I\\'m Zoraida Sambolin. We are bringing you the news from A to Z. It is 6 a.m. here in the east so let\\'s get started. Up first, you know, unrelenting and unforgiving, it is the heat wave, devastating heat from K.C. to D.C. will continue today and through the July 4th holiday as well. It will feel like 115 degrees in parts of the Midwest today. For millions without power there will be absolutely no relief. At least 19 people have died in the last week. That\\'s when those deadly storms swept the nation and about 1.7 million people still do not have electricity. This is days after the storm. Many may not until Friday at the earliest. And take a look at the states waiting for the lights to come back on, 410,000 customers in West Virginia, 400,000 customers in Ohio, 340,000 in Virginia in the same boat. These people will have to deal with more soaring temperatures. Take a look at this map, 13 states are under heat advisories this morning. Those are states highlighted right there on your screen, pretty much half there. Sandra Endo is in Arlington, Virginia, a lot of criticism in this morning, but in your area, 410,000 customers still without power. How are they coping? SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they are trying to make the best of it, Zoraida, and clearly the frustration and patience is running out because residents here, this is day four since the storm. Look at the scene still left behind by the massive storm. You can see downed power lines toppled over trees, crushing cars here. We came in the middle of the night, really, early morning hours. And it was pitch black because, again, so many people here are suffering without electricity. As you mentioned, these temperatures are expected to soar near triple digits today in this region alone as so many states are under heat advisories as well. So residents here who are suffering without power are trying everything they can to stay cool and they\\'re trying to cope. But it\\'s getting harder. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have a pool and we have a generator, but a lot of these people don\\'t have nothing. It makes you want to sit down and cry. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\\'s been very, very hot, not getting no relief in the liquid form and people are in dire straits really. ENDO: So obviously, very frustrated residents. Also, local authorities are urging utility companies to get their act together, to work faster to try to restore the power in these hard hit communities, power companies say they are trying their best. Workers are out there in the sweltering heat, which is not good condition. Also, it\\'s hard to get into the areas because of so many downed trees. So they are trying as hard as they can, but of course, they are welcoming all of the federal help and extra bodies to really help in this recovery effort -- Zoraida. SAMBOLIN: Yes, we do know that they are working hard, but everybody is so frustrated. So besides power being out, what other challenges are communities facing? I read some water towers in some areas need the electricity in order to operate so they are not getting that basic necessity of water. ENDO: Absolutely. Also, the 911 system, you really want all of your emergency systems to respond when a catastrophe happens and it really failed in Fairfax County, Virginia, the 911 system was working at half capacity as of Monday. They are trying to figure out why their primary and secondary backup systems did not work when people were calling in medical emergencies and also emergencies because of the storm. All they were hearing was the busy signal or a recording and sometimes even just dead silence. SAMBOLIN: I would imagine that at the end of all of this they are probably going to do a bit of an investigation to find out what went wrong and how to fix it for the future. Sandra Endo reporting live for us, thank you very much. BANFIELD: So at 4 minutes past 6, you probably already know the answer to this question, but how hot is it? Check out Wisconsin for a moment and get to your television, you\\'ll want to see this video. So hot there that the extreme heat warped the pavement in that state and created a bit of a ramp on Highway 29 and look what happens when a car tries to go over, launched, airborne, that\\'s a heat buckled highway. The car landed and swerved across the other side of the highway and then went off the road leaving a cloud of dust in its path. That video was posted on YouTube. Lucky to report and happy to report that we haven\\'t heard of any injuries and the highway was repaired and reopened. But imagine if you\\'re that driver, pretty remarkable stuff. Alexandra Steele is standing by. Wisconsin not the place expecting to hear temperatures in the 100s and it seems as though the south and Midwest has flipped flopped. ALEXANDRA STEELE, AMS METEOROLOGIST: You know, what you\\'re looking at there, that road buckling and actually what it is, the joints below that concrete, heat expand and there\\'s nowhere for the joints to go but up. So they rip up the road. So a lot of people out there possibly sealing those roads for that extra protection and how high? Take a look, Minneapolis, right now is at 85 degrees. That\\'s higher than their average high for the day heading up to 97. KC today, 100, the access of that intense heat where it was here on the south, Atlanta, Makin, Georgia, 106 over the weekend. We\\'ve seen this heat now through the upper Midwest, central plains and southern plains. And also not quite into the 100s, but Washington, D.C. and of course all the way from Ohio to Virginia where we do have power outages, that\\'s where the heat will be. You can see the expensiveness of this, KC 102, Chicago, still at 98, Washington still at 92. So again, it\\'s not going anywhere, that\\'s the biggest problem. Of course, tomorrow is the Fourth of July. We want to show you temperatures. These are the 9:00 p.m. temperatures, 84, Washington, 80. Don\\'t get fooled by that. We\\'re expecting showers and isolated thunderstorms, kind of pounding on the rain cooled air a little bit, 85 in Atlanta. Chance for isolated storms, KC, no threat, 94 in Dallas, the Pacific northwest, that\\'s where the weather will be great, 67. Beautiful in Portland as well for fireworks, dry skies, clear conditions and cold front moves through and smooth sailing there. BANFIELD: It does look nice, but people should really pay attention to the weather forecast if they are going to be outside for the barbecues on the Fourth of July tomorrow. So thank you for that, Alex. SAMBOLIN: You know, some states are canceling their fireworks because of the intense heat. BANFIELD: I\\'m not surprised, probably a good idea. SAMBOLIN: All right, it\\'s 6 minutes past the hour. Syrian President Bashar Al Assad says he -- 100 percent regrets that his forces shot down a Turkish war plane last month. According to Reuters, Assad insists that Syria did not know that the plane belonged to Turkey until after it was hit. He says the jet was flying in an area previously used by Israel\\'s Air Force. Syria\\'s relationship with Turkey, a long time ally, has been deteriorating in recent months. The Turkish government deploying troops along the border with Syria last week, they say as a precaution. BANFIELD: Some questions this morning in the Penn State scandal. Did former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno influence university officials not to report a 2001 incident involving Assistant Coach Jerry Sandusky and a young boy in a locker room shower? According to some e-mails between former university executives, a decision was made to approach Sandusky and report him to Child Welfare officials and not only that, report him to his Second Mile Charity as well. Problem is, it appears that Coach Paterno, who died in January, then had a conversation with the former Athletic Director, Tim Curley. Mr. Curley then e-mails school officials and says this. Quote, \"After giving it more thought and talking it over with Joe yesterday, I\\'m uncomfortable with what we agreed with the next steps, having trouble going to everyone, but the person involved.\" We\\'ve also learned that Penn State reached out to legal counsel during the time of these e-mail exchanges. Joe Paterno\\'s family is now calling on Pennsylvania\\'s attorney general. And not only that, but also the former director of the FBI, to release all of the e-mails and records related to their investigations. Why Louie Free? He was brought on by Penn State to do an internal investigation. SAMBOLIN: The British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline agreeing to pay $3 billion in fine in a case the Justice Department calls the largest health care fraud settlement in U.S. history. Glaxo admitting it promoted anti-depressants Paxil and Wellbutrin for uses not approved by U.S. regulators including the treatment of children. The pharmaceutical giant also conceding it withheld data and made unsupported safety claims about its diabetes drug Avandia. BANFIELD: The 45-year-old Dara Torres has missed out on a chance to go for gold on her sixth United States Olympic team effort. Torres missed the cut just by one spot. She finished fourth in the finals in the 50-meter women\\'s freestyle. It just happened last night at the Olympic trials in Omaha, but look at the smile and the hugs. By the way, she\\'s a 12-time medallist, OK, she\\'s actually doing pretty well. She began her Olympic career back in \\'84. In the \\'84 summer games in Los Angeles, I think some of our interns may not have been born by then. This is one heck of a career, Dara, you have nothing to be sorry for. A lot of people really appreciate you. Coming up at 6:45 this morning, we\\'re going to talk about Olympic qualifying rounds and what it\\'s like with 1996 gold medallist, Kerri Strug. Who could forget when she made history overcoming that injured ankle to lead the U.S. women\\'s gymnastics team to victory in Atlanta. Kerri Strug, coming up. SAMBOLIN: The Olympic torch relay nearly disrupted in the U.K. when two little kids tried to grab it yesterday. They ran up to another torch bearers breaking through the security bubble. That surrounds the flame as it makes its 8,000 mile journey to the London Olympics. I\\'m happy to report that no arrests were made. Too overly excited kids. BANFIELD: I\\'m trying to figure out if they were overly excited kids or if they were really naughty or they just wanted to touch it. They are definitely grabbing it. SAMBOLIN: Well, they figured, if I got it, I\\'m going to show it off. BANFIELD: All right, someone is going to be in time-out that night. So this story has been plaguing the west. It is a tragedy. It\\'s been a setback in the battle against raging wildfires, trying to fight the fires, but the machinery collapsing on you. Details of the fatal crash that forced officials to ground an entire fleet of firefighting planes.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
