]ng, trying to mediate): Come on, children. Let's not fight. We're all in this together.\n\n**EVELYN** (softening slightly): I'm sorry, Maria. It's just that...\n\n**MARIA** (nodding understandingly): I know, dear. Pressure can make us act differently. Why don't you tell us about your meeting? Maybe talking about it will help.\n\n**EVELYN** (sighing): Fine. I'm meeting with potential investors for my startup. It's a big deal. If this elevator doesn't move, I might miss the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\n**LEON** (intrigued): What's your startup about?\n\n**EVELYN** (proudly): It's an AI-driven marketing platform. It analyzes consumer behavior and creates personalized advertising campaigns.\n\n**LEON** (whistling): That sounds fancy. So, like, it predicts what people want before they even know themselves?\n\n**EVELYN** (nodding): Exactly. It's revolutionary.\n\n**MARIA** (curious): And you're seeking investors for this?\n\n**EVELYN** (firmly): Yes. I need funds to scale up and compete with bigger players.\n\n**LEON** (smiling): Well, if it's as good as you say, I'm sure you'll get the investment. Maybe I can even get you some artistic favors in return.\n\n**EVELYN** (smiling despite herself): Maybe. Now, enough about me. What about you, Leon? What brings you here?\n\n**LEON** (shrugging): Oh, just visiting a friend who lives upstairs. Wasn't expecting an elevator adventure.\n\n**MARIA** (smiling): Adventure? That's one way to look at it.\n\n**LEON** (grinning): Why not? It's better than being stuck in traffic.\n\n**EVELYN** (skeptical): Traffic? At least in an elevator, there's no honking or horns.\n\n**LEON** (laughing): True that. So, Maria, how about you? Where are you headed?\n\n**MARIA** (smiling softly): Oh, I was just going to the penthouse for a tea party with some old friends.\n\n**EVELYN** (surprised): A tea party? At the penthouse?\n\n**MARIA** (nodding): Yes, isn't that lovely? They've invited me to celebrate my retirement.\n\n**LEON** (admiringly): That's so sweet. You must be excited.\n\n**MARIA** (smiling): I am, dear. It's been a long journey, but I'm looking forward to relaxing and pursuing my hobbies.\n\n**EVELYN** (suddenly interested): Hobbies? What do you like to do in your free time?\n\n**MARIA** (enthusiastically): Oh, I love reading, gardening, and knitting. And I've recently taken up watercolor painting.\n\n**LEON** (excited): Really? Me too! Maybe I can show you some of my sketches sometime.\n\n**MARIA** (delighted): I'd love that, Leon.\n\n**EVELYN** (looking at her watch again): This is all very charming, but time is ticking.\n\n**LEON** (looking around): Maybe we should see if there's an emergency button or something.\n\n**MARIA** (pointing): There's a phone here. Maybe we can call for help.\n\n**EVELYN** (standing up): Finally, a practical suggestion. Let's see.\n\n**(Evelyn approaches the emergency phone and picks it up.)**\n\n**EVELYN** (into the phone): Hello? Is anyone there? We're stuck in the elevator.\n\n**(Pause)**\n\n**EVELYN** (impatiently): Hello? Come on, pick up.\n\n**(Maria walks over and looks at the phone panel.)**\n\n**MARIA** (noticing something): Evelyn, maybe you need to press the talk button or something.\n\n**EVELYN** (annoyed): Oh, right. (Presses another button) Hello? Can you hear me now?\n\n**(Pause)**\n\n**EVELYN** (relieved): Yes! Hello? We're stuck between floors. Can you send someone to help us?\n\n**OPERATOR (voice over the phone): Please stay calm. We are dispatching maintenance right away. Estimated time is 15 minutes.**\n\n**EVELYN** (sighing): Great. Just great.\n\n**LEON** (smiling mischievously): Well, at least we have time to get to know each other better.\n\n**EVELYN** (rolling her eyes): Joy.\n\n**MARIA** (laughing): Now, now, Evelyn. Maybe this is a chance for us to connect on a personal level.\n\n**EVELYN** (skeptical): I doubt it, Maria. But go ahead, I'm listening.\n\n**MARIA** (smiling): So, Evelyn, tell us about your family. Do you have any children?\n\n**EVELYN** (pausing): No, I don't. I've been too busy with work.\n\n**LEON** (sympathetically): That must be tough. Balancing career and personal life.\n\n**EVELYN** (defensively): It's manageable. One has to make sacrifices.\n\n**MARIA** (gently): But at what cost, dear? Family is important.\n\n**EVELYN** (softening): I know, Maria. It's just that my work is my passion. I can't imagine giving it up.\n\n**LEON** (nodding): I get that. Art is the same way for me. It consumes me.\n\n**EVELYN** (looking at him): Really? I never would have guessed.\n\n**LEON** (smiling): Yeah, people often think artists are just hippies who dabble in paint. But it's a serious commitment.\n\n**MARIA** (nodding): Absolutely. Any creative pursuit requires dedication and hard work.\n\n**EVELYN** (thoughtfully): I suppose so.\n\n**LEON** (looking at his sketchbook): Hey, Maria, can I show you what I've been working on?\n\n**MARIA** (excitedly): Oh, yes, please do.\n\n**LEON** (flipping through pages): Here, I've been doing some urban sketches. Capturing the city's energy.\n\n**MARIA** (admiring the sketches): These are gorgeous, Leon. So vibrant and full of life.\n\n**LEON** (beaming): Thanks, Maria. That means a lot coming from you.\n\n**EVELYN** (looking at the sketches): Hmm, interesting. Not my taste, but I can see the skill.\n\n**LEON** (defensively): What's wrong with it?\n\n**EVELYN** (coolly): It's too chaotic for my liking. I prefer more structured, minimalist art.\n\n**LEON** (shrugging): That's fine. Different strokes for different folks.\n\n**MARIA** (smiling): It's all about personal preference, dear.\n\n**EVELYN** (sighing): I need to check my emails. Maybe I can still salvage something.\n\n**(Evelyn sits down and opens her briefcase, pulling out her laptop.)**\n\n**LEON** (watching her): You work anywhere, don't you?\n\n**EVELYN** (typing): Necessity is the mother of invention.\n\n**MARIA** (smiling): Sometimes, it's good to disconnect, you know.\n\n**EVELYN** (without looking up): I can't afford to disconnect, Maria. Not in my line of work.\n\n**LEON** (nodding): She's right. In today's world, being always connected is expected.\n\n**MARIA** (shaking her head): But at what cost? Our mental health, our relationships...\n\n**EVELYN** (interrupting): I manage just fine, thank you.\n\n**LEON** (laughing): Yeah, but maybe you could use a break once in a while.\n\n**EVELYN** (closing her laptop): Look, I appreciate your concern, but this isn't the time or place for this discussion.\n\n**MARIA** (calmly): Of course, dear. My apologies.\n\n**LEON** (changing the subject): So, Maria, what's your favorite book?\n\n**MARIA** (beaming): Oh, that's a tough one. I love so many books. But if I had to pick one, it would be \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Such profound lessons about empathy and understanding.\n\n**LEON** (nodding): That's a classic. I haven't read it in ages. Maybe I should revisit it.\n\n**EVELYN** (looking up from her phone): Empathy? Really? Sometimes, in business, you need to be ruthless.\n\n**MARIA** (firmly): Ruthless? I don't think so, Evelyn. Empathy is key to building strong relationships, both personal and professional.\n\n**EVELYN** (skeptical): Maybe in teaching, but in business, it's all about the bottom line.\n\n**LEON** (chiming in): But you can have both, right? Be successful and empathetic?\n\n**EVELYN** (shrugging): I suppose. But it's not always that simple.\n\n**MARIA** (nodding): It's all about balance, dear. Finding that middle ground.\n\n**LEON** (smiling): Exactly. Like in art, you need contrast to create harmony.\n\n**EVELYN** (smiling slightly): You make it sound so poetic, Leon.\n\n**LEON** (grinning): Well, that's because I am an artist.\n\n**MARIA** (laughing): And a charming one at that.\n\n**EVELYN** (checking her watch again): 10 minutes already. This is taking forever.\n\n**LEON** (trying to cheer her up): Hey, maybe we can play a game or something.\n\n**EVELYN** (doubtful): A game?\n\n**LEON** (enthusiastically): Yeah, like truth or dare, or maybe charades.\n\n**EVELYN** (mockingly): Oh, brilliant. Because being stuck in an elevator isn't already embarrassing enough.\n\n**MARIA** (laughing): Now, now, Evelyn. Lighten up. It might be fun.\n\n**EVELYN** (sighing): Fine. But I get to choose the game.\n\n**LEON** (smiling): Deal.\n\n**MARIA** (smiling): Maybe this won't be so bad after all.\n\n**(Suddenly, the elevator shakes slightly and starts moving again. All three look at each other in surprise.)**\n\n**EVELYN** (relieved): Finally!\n\n**(The elevator dings and the doors open onto the Lobby floor. Evelyn steps out first, followed by Leon and Maria.)**\n\n**EVELYN** (looking back into the elevator): Well, that was eventful.\n\n**LEON** (smiling): Yeah, maybe next time we should plan to get stuck together.\n\n**MARIA** (laughing): Don't jinx it, Leon.\n\n**EVELYN** (smiling softly): Who knows? Maybe we'll cross paths again.\n\n**LEON** (nodding): Here's to new connections.\n\n**MARIA** (hugging Evelyn): Take care, dear. And remember, sometimes, getting stuck leads to unexpected treasures.\n\n**EVELYN** (smiling): I'll keep that in mind, Maria.\n\n**(They part ways, each going their separate directions. As Evelyn heads towards her meeting, she looks back once, smiling to herself.)**\n\n**END OF PLAY**"
