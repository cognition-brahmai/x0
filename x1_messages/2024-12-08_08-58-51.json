        "content": "I've got this task to create a Python script that reads names and email addresses from a CSV file and sends personalized greeting emails to each person using the `smtplib` library. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I get all the parts right. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to read data from a CSV file. I'm assuming the CSV has columns for names and email addresses. I should use the `csv` module for this, which is part of Python's standard library. I'll need to open the file, read it, and store the names and emails in some kind of data structure, maybe a list of dictionaries.\n\nNext, I need to send emails using `smtplib`. I've used this library before to send emails, but usually just one at a time. Since I have multiple recipients, I need to loop through the list and send an email to each one personalized with their name.\n\nI should also consider email formatting. The subject should include the recipient's name, and the body should have a brief greeting message that also includes their name. Maybe something like \"Hello [Name], welcome to our service!\"\n\nSecurity is also a concern. I need to make sure that email credentials are handled securely. Probably, I'll ask the user to input their email and password when the script runs, or maybe use environment variables to store sensitive information.\n\nAlso, I should think about error handling. What if the CSV file is missing or has errors? What if there are issues sending emails, like network problems or invalid email addresses? I need to handle these cases gracefully, perhaps by skipping problematic entries and logging errors.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to implement:\n\n1. Prompt the user for the path to the CSV file.\n\n2. Read the CSV file and extract names and email addresses.\n\n3. Ask the user for their email credentials (sender's email and password).\n\n4. Set up the SMTP connection using `smtplib`.\n\n5. For each recipient:\n\na. Compose the email subject and body with the recipient's name.\n\nb. Send the email to the recipient's email address.\n\nc. Handle any errors that occur during sending.\n\n6. Close the SMTP connection.\n\n7. Provide feedback to the user about which emails were sent successfully and which had errors.\n\nI should also consider making the email content customizable. Maybe allow the user to input a template for the greeting message.\n\nAlright, let's start coding. First, I'll import the necessary modules: `csv` for reading the CSV file and `smtplib` along with `email` for constructing and sending the emails.\n\nI need to decide on the CSV format. Let's assume the CSV has headers like \"Name\" and \"Email\". I'll use the `csv.DictReader` to read the file, which will make it easy to access columns by header name.\n\nNow, for the email sending part, I need to choose an SMTP server. Since many people use Gmail, I'll assume the sender is using a Gmail account. I'll need to use Gmail's SMTP server, which is `smtp.gmail.com`, and the port 587 for TLS.\n\nWait, but I should make this more general. Maybe ask the user for their SMTP server details, but to keep it simple, I'll hardcode it for Gmail for now.\n\nAnother thing: to avoid exposing passwords in the script, I'll prompt the user to enter their email and password when the script runs.\n\nI should also consider using environment variables or a config file to store sensitive information, but for simplicity, I'll go with user input.\n\nLet me sketch a rough code structure:\n\n```\n\nimport csv\n\nimport smtplib\n\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\n\n# Get CSV file path from user\n\ncsv_path = input(\"Enter the path to the CSV file: \")\n\n# Read CSV file\n\ncontacts = []\n\nwith open(csv_path, newline='') as file:\n\nreader = csv.DictReader(file)\n\nfor row in reader:\n\ncontacts.append({'name': row['Name'], 'email': row['Email']})\n\n# Get sender's email credentials\n\nsender_email = input(\"Enter your email address: \")\n\nsender_password = input(\"Enter your email password: \")\n\n# Set up SMTP connection\n\nsmtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'\n\nsmtp_port = 587\n\nserver = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)\n\nserver.starttls()\n\nserver.login(sender_email, sender_password)\n\n# Send emails\n\nfor contact in contacts:\n\nsubject = f\"Hello {contact['name']}!\"\n\nbody = f\"Dear {contact['name]},\\n\\nWelcome to our service! We're excited to have you on board.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\"\n\nmessage = MIMEMultipart()\n\nmessage['From'] = sender_email\n\nmessage['To'] = contact['email']\n\nmessage['Subject'] = subject\n\nmessage.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n\ntry:\n\nserver.sendmail(sender_email, contact['email'], message.as_string())\n\nprint(f\"Email sent to {contact['name']} <{contact['email']}>\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nprint(f\"Failed to send email to {contact['name']} <{contact['email']}>: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Close SMTP connection\n\nserver.quit()\n\n```\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. Now, I need to test this script with a sample CSV file and see if it works as expected.\n\nI should also think about error handling for the CSV file reading. What if the file doesn't exist or has missing columns? I need to add try-except blocks to handle these situations.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider rate limiting by email providers. Sending a large number of emails in a short period might trigger safeguards or block the sender's account. Maybe include a delay between sending emails, but that might make the script take too long to run.\n\nAlternatively, I can send all the emails in a single connection, which might be more efficient.\n\nWait, `smtplib` allows sending multiple emails in one connection, which is better for performance and reduces the load on the server.\n\nI should also think about the email content. Maybe allow the user to input a custom greeting message.\n\nLet me enhance the script to include these features.\n\nFirst, add error handling for file operations and CSV parsing.\n\nSecond, allow the user to input a custom greeting message.\n\nThird, consider using a configuration file for SMTP settings instead of hardcoding them.\n\nFourth, think about logging errors to a file instead of just printing them.\n\nFifth, maybe add a summary at the end showing how many emails were sent successfully and how many failed.\n\nThis is getting a bit more complex, but it's good to have these features for a robust script.\n\nLet me update the code accordingly.\n\n```\n\nimport csv\n\nimport smtplib\n\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\n\ndef main():\n\ntry:\n\n# Get CSV file path from user\n\ncsv_path = input(\"Enter the path to the CSV file: \")\n\n# Read CSV file\n\ncontacts = read_contacts(csv_path)\n\n# Get sender's email credentials\n\nsender_email = input(\"Enter your email address: \")\n\nsender_password = input(\"Enter your email password: \")\n\n# Set up SMTP connection\n\nsmtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'\n\nsmtp_port = 587\n\nserver = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)\n\nserver.starttls()\n\nserver.login(sender_email, sender_password)\n\n# Get custom greeting message\n\ngreeting = input(\"Enter the greeting message: \")\n\n# Send emails\n\nsuccess_count = 0\n\nfailure_count = 0\n\nfor contact in contacts:\n\nsubject = f\"Hello {contact['name']}!\"\n\nbody = f\"Dear {contact['name']},\\n\\n{greeting}\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\"\n\nmessage = MIMEMultipart()\n\nmessage['From'] = sender_email\n\nmessage['To'] = contact['email']\n\nmessage['Subject'] = subject\n\nmessage.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n\ntry:\n\nserver.sendmail(sender_email, contact['email'], message.as_string())\n\nprint(f\"Email sent to {contact['name']} <{contact['email']}>\")\n\nsuccess_count += 1\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nprint(f\"Failed to send email to {contact['name']} <{contact['email']}>: {str(e)}\")\n\nfailure_count += 1\n\n# Close SMTP connection\n\nserver.quit()\n\n# Summary\n\nprint(f\"\\nSummary: {success_count} emails sent successfully, {failure_count} failures.\")\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n\nprint(\"Error: The specified CSV file was not found.\")\n\nexcept KeyError:\n\nprint(\"Error: The CSV file is missing required columns (Name, Email).\")\n\nexcept smtplib.SMTPAuthenticationError:\n\nprint(\"Error: SMTP authentication failed. Please check your email and password.\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nprint(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n\ndef read_contacts(csv_path):\n\nwith open(csv_path, newline='') as file:\n\nreader = csv.DictReader(file)\n\ncontacts = []\n\nfor row in reader:\n\ncontacts.append({'name': row['Name'], 'email': row['Email']})\n\nreturn contacts\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\nmain()\n\n```\n\nThis version includes error handling for file not found, missing columns in CSV, SMTP authentication failures, and a general exception catch-all for other errors.\n\nIt also prompts the user for a custom greeting message and provides a summary at the end.\n\nI should test this script with a sample CSV file to ensure it works correctly.\n\nSample CSV content:\n\n```\n\nName,Email\n\nAlice,alice@example.com\n\nBob,bob@example.com\n\nCharlie,Charlie@example.com\n\n```\n\nMake sure that the email addresses are correct and that the sender's account allows less secure apps if using Gmail.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up app-specific passwords for Gmail accounts.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that Gmail has limits on the number of emails you can send per day. If sending a large number of emails, consider using a different email service provider that allows higher sending limits.\n\nAnother enhancement could be to read the SMTP server settings from a configuration file, making the script more flexible for different email providers.\n\nBut for now, this should suffice for the task at hand.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo accomplish the task of sending personalized greeting emails to recipients listed in a CSV file, you can use the following Python script. This script reads a CSV file containing names and email addresses, constructs a personalized email for each recipient, and sends it using the `smtplib` library.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Get CSV file path from user\n        csv_path = input(\"Enter the path to the CSV file: \")\n        \n        # Read CSV file\n        contacts = read_contacts(csv_path)\n        \n        # Get sender's email credentials\n        sender_email = input(\"Enter your email address: \")\n        sender_password = input(\"Enter your email password: \")\n        \n        # Set up SMTP connection\n        smtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'\n        smtp_port = 587\n        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)\n        server.starttls()\n        server.login(sender_email, sender_password)\n        \n        # Get custom greeting message\n        greeting = input(\"Enter the greeting message: \")\n        \n        # Send emails\n        success_count = 0\n        failure_count = 0\n        for contact in contacts:\n            subject = f\"Hello {contact['name']}!\"\n            body = f\"Dear {contact['name']},\\n\\n{greeting}\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\"\n            message = MIMEMultipart()\n            message['From'] = sender_email\n            message['To'] = contact['email']\n            message['Subject'] = subject\n            message.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n            try:\n                server.sendmail(sender_email, contact['email'], message.as_string())\n                print(f\"Email sent to {contact['name']} <{contact['email']}>\")\n                success_count += 1\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Failed to send email to {contact['name']} <{contact['email']}>: {str(e)}\")\n                failure_count += 1\n        \n        # Close SMTP connection\n        server.quit()\n        \n        # Summary\n        print(f\"\\nSummary: {success_count} emails sent successfully, {failure_count} failures.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"Error: The specified CSV file was not found.\")\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"Error: The CSV file is missing required columns (Name, Email).\")\n    except smtplib.SMTPAuthenticationError:\n        print(\"Error: SMTP authentication failed. Please check your email and password.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n\ndef read_contacts(csv_path):\n    with open(csv_path, newline='') as file:\n        reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n        contacts = []\n        for row in reader:\n            contacts.append({'name': row['Name'], 'email': row['Email']})\n        return contacts\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the CSV File:**\n   - The script uses the `csv` module to read a CSV file containing columns for names and email addresses.\n   \n2. **Setting Up SMTP Connection:**\n   - Uses `smtplib` to connect to Gmail's SMTP server and logs in with the provided credentials.\n   \n3. **Sending Emails:**\n   - Iterates through each recipient, constructs a personalized email with a subject and body that includes the recipient's name, and sends it using the SMTP server.\n   \n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - Handles exceptions for file not found, missing columns in CSV, SMTP authentication failures, and other general exceptions.\n   \n5. **Summary:**\n   - Provides a summary of successful and failed email sends after processing all recipients.\n\nThis script ensures that each recipient receives a personalized email and handles potential errors gracefully, providing feedback for each attempt."
