        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. So, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Right? So, to check if a number is prime, we need to make sure it's not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n\nLet's think about how to approach this in Python. We can write a function that takes an integer as input and returns True if it's prime and False otherwise.\n\nFirst, we should handle the edge cases. For example, if the number is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime. If it's 2, which is the only even prime number, it should return True. For numbers greater than 2, we can check if they're even; if they are, and not 2, they're not prime.\n\nFor odd numbers greater than 2, we can check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number, skipping even numbers. This is efficient because if a number n is not a prime, it can be factored into two factors a and b. If both a and b were greater than the square root of n, a*b would be greater than n. Similarly, if both were less than the square root of n, a*b would be less than n. So at least one of those factors must be less than or equal to the square root of n, and to check if n is prime, we only need to test for factors up to the square root.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the function:\n\n- If number \u2264 1: return False\n\n- If number == 2: return True\n\n- If number is even and not 2: return False\n\n- For odd numbers > 2:\n\n- Check divisibility from 3 to sqrt(number), stepping by 2 (to skip even numbers)\n\n- If any divisor is found, return False\n\n- If no divisors found, return True\n\nWe can use the math.sqrt function to calculate the square root, but we need to import the math module for that.\n\nAlso, to make it more efficient, we can iterate up to the square root of the number plus one, and use integer division.\n\nLet me think about an example. Take number = 15.\n\n- 15 > 2\n\n- It's odd\n\n- Check from 3 to sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87, so up to 3\n\n- 15 % 3 == 0, so not prime\n\nAnother example: number = 17\n\n- 17 > 2\n\n- It's odd\n\n- Check from 3 to sqrt(17) \u2248 4.12, so up to 3\n\n- 17 % 3 != 0\n\n- 17 % 5 != 0 (but 5 is already beyond sqrt(17)), so prime\n\nWait, in this case, we need to make sure we're checking up to the floor of sqrt(number).\n\nIn Python, we can use the math.isqrt() function, which returns the integer square root, which is more efficient and precise for this purpose.\n\nSo, in code, it would look something like:\n\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n\nif n <= 1:\n\nreturn False\n\nif n == 2:\n\nreturn True\n\nif n % 2 == 0:\n\nreturn False\n\nsqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)\n\nfor i in range(3, sqrt_n + 1, 2):\n\nif n % i == 0:\n\nreturn False\n\nreturn True\n\nLet's test this function with some values.\n\nis_prime(1) \u2192 False\n\nis_prime(2) \u2192 True\n\nis_prime(3) \u2192 True\n\nis_prime(4) \u2192 False\n\nis_prime(5) \u2192 True\n\nis_prime(15) \u2192 False\n\nis_prime(17) \u2192 True\n\nLooks good.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to optimize even further, you can check divisibility by 2 and 3, then iterate through numbers of the form 6k \u00b1 1 up to the square root, but that might be overkill for a basic prime check.\n\nFor most practical purposes, the above function should suffice.\n\nIf you need to check multiple numbers, consider memoizing the results or generating a list of primes up to a certain limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.\n\nBut for a simple function to check if a single number is prime, the above should work fine.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!\n\n## Final Solution\nTo check if a number is prime in Python, you can use the following function. This function efficiently determines primality by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)\n    for i in range(3, sqrt_n + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.\n   - 2 is the only even prime number.\n   - Even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.\n\n2. **Efficient Check:**\n   - For odd numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number (inclusive), skipping even numbers.\n   - Using `math.isqrt(n)` for the integer square root of `n` ensures efficiency and precision.\n\n3. **Functionality:**\n   - Returns `True` if the number is prime.\n   - Returns `False` otherwise.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is both correct and efficient for checking primality."
