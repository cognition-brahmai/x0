        "content": "So the hospital wants to upgrade its emergency department to handle more patients and reduce wait times. Currently, they have 20 beds and serve about 100 patients per day. Their goal is to serve 150 patients per day. Assuming that each bed can serve one patient at a time and that the average length of stay doesn't change, I need to figure out how many extra beds they need to meet this new target.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's happening right now. With 20 beds, they're serving 100 patients daily. That means, on average, each bed is used for a certain number of patients per day. To find out how many patients per bed per day that is, I can divide the total number of patients by the number of beds.\n\nSo, 100 patients per day divided by 20 beds equals 5 patients per bed per day. That means each bed is used to treat 5 different patients every day.\n\nNow, they want to serve 150 patients per day. If each bed can still handle 5 patients per day, then I can calculate the required number of beds by dividing the desired number of patients by the number of patients per bed per day.\n\nSo, 150 patients per day divided by 5 patients per bed per day equals 30 beds.\n\nWait a minute, but they already have 20 beds. So, the additional beds needed would be 30 minus 20, which is 10 beds.\n\nBut let me double-check this. If each bed can serve 5 patients per day, and they have 30 beds, that would be 30 beds times 5 patients per bed per day, which equals 150 patients per day. That matches their goal.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation. For example, is there a possibility that adding more beds could affect the efficiency or the average length of stay? The problem says to assume that the average length of stay remains constant, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are limitations on space or staffing that might impact how many additional beds can be added. But since the question doesn't mention any constraints like that, I can ignore them for now.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all patients require the same amount of time in the emergency department. In reality, patients have different needs, but according to the problem, the average length of stay remains constant. So, I can proceed with the assumption that each bed can serve the same number of patients per day.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If each bed serves 5 patients per day, that implies that the average length of stay is a certain number of hours. For example, if the emergency department is open 24 hours a day, and each bed turns over 5 times, then the average length of stay would be 24 hours divided by 5, which is 4.8 hours per patient.\n\nBut again, since the average length of stay is assumed to remain constant, and they want to serve 50% more patients, they would need 50% more beds.\n\nSo, 50% of 20 beds is 10 beds, which aligns with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs to add 10 beds to meet their goal of serving 150 patients per day.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Suppose they optimize processes or reduce wait times without adding beds. However, the problem specifies that they are adding beds to achieve this goal, so I should focus on the bed capacity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some beds are used for observation or other purposes and aren't available for acute care. But again, the problem doesn't specify any such distinctions, so I'll assume all beds are used for serving the 100 patients per day.\n\nI think my initial calculation is correct. They need 10 additional beds to go from serving 100 to 150 patients per day, assuming each bed can serve the same number of patients per day and the average length of stay remains constant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
