        "content": "So I've got this equation to solve: 3x - 7 = 11. I need to find out what x is. Alright, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the goal is to isolate x on one side of the equation. That means I need to get rid of any numbers added to or subtracted from x, and also account for any coefficients multiplied by x.\n\nLooking at the equation, 3x - 7 = 11, I see that x is being multiplied by 3 and then 7 is being subtracted. To isolate x, I need to undo these operations.\n\nI think I should start by dealing with the subtraction first. So, there's a -7 in the equation. To cancel that out, I can add 7 to both sides of the equation. That way, the -7 and +7 will cancel each other out on the left side.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n3x = 18\n\nOkay, now x is being multiplied by 3. To isolate x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 3.\n\nSo:\n\n3x / 3 = 18 / 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 6\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check by plugging the value back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x - 7 = 11\n\nPlugging in x = 6:\n\n3*(6) - 7 = 18 - 7 = 11\n\nYes, that matches the right side of the equation. So, x = 6 is the correct solution.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to solve this equation. Maybe I could have started by dividing both sides by 3 first, instead of adding 7.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nStarting with:\n\n3x - 7 = 11\n\nIf I divide both sides by 3:\n\n(3x - 7)/3 = 11/3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx - 7/3 = 11/3\n\nNow, to isolate x, I can add 7/3 to both sides:\n\nx - 7/3 + 7/3 = 11/3 + 7/3\n\nx = 18/3\n\nx = 6\n\nAgain, I get x = 6. So, both approaches lead to the same answer, which is good.\n\nI think another way to solve this could be to move the -7 to the right side of the equation, which would change its sign to positive.\n\nSo, starting again:\n\n3x - 7 = 11\n\nMoving -7 to the right side:\n\n3x = 11 + 7\n\n3x = 18\n\nThen, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 18 / 3\n\nx = 6\n\nSame answer again. It seems no matter which method I use, x comes out to be 6.\n\nJust to make sure there aren't any tricks here, let's consider if there's any possibility of multiple solutions or if x could be something else.\n\nIn this case, it's a linear equation, so there should be only one solution. The equation is straightforward, and I've checked it using different methods, all leading to x = 6.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that x = 6 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
