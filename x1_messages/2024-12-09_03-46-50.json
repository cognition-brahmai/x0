        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 250 units every day, and each unit sells for $35. I need to find out how much revenue the factory will generate in one week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many units are produced in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, I can multiply the daily production by 7.\n\nSo, 250 units/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 1,750 units/week.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the revenue from selling these 1,750 units. Each unit sells for $35, so I can multiply the number of units by the price per unit.\n\nRevenue = 1,750 units \u00d7 $35/unit.\n\nNow, let's do the math.\n\n1,750 \u00d7 35.\n\nI can break this down to make it easier. Let's see, 1,750 \u00d7 30 is 52,500, and 1,750 \u00d7 5 is 8,750. So, 52,500 + 8,750 equals 61,250.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 35 as 30 + 5.\n\nSo, 1,750 \u00d7 30 = 52,500.\n\nAnd 1,750 \u00d7 5 = 8,750.\n\nAdding those together: 52,500 + 8,750 = 61,250.\n\nHmm, that seems correct now.\n\nTherefore, the factory will generate $61,250 in revenue in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{61250} \\]"
