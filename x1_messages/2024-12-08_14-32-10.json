The construction cost for the soccer field is $500,000, while each basketball court costs $150,000, and the swimming pool costs $1 million. The city has a budget of $2.5 million for this project. Calculate how many basketball courts can be built if the city decides to include both the soccer field and the swimming pool in the complex. Also, estimate the annual maintenance cost for the entire complex, assuming the soccer field requires $20,000 per year, each basketball court needs $10,000 per year, and the swimming pool demands $50,000 per year."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city is planning to build a sports complex that includes a soccer field, some basketball courts, and a swimming pool. The costs are as follows:\n\n- Soccer field: $500,000\n\n- Each basketball court: $150,000\n\n- Swimming pool: $1,000,000\n\nAnd the total budget for the project is $2,500,000.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many basketball courts can be built if the city decides to include both the soccer field and the swimming pool.\n\nOkay, so the soccer field and the swimming pool together cost:\n\n$500,000 (soccer field) + $1,000,000 (swimming pool) = $1,500,000\n\nNow, subtract that from the total budget to see how much is left for basketball courts:\n\n$2,500,000 (total budget) - $1,500,000 (soccer field + swimming pool) = $1,000,000\n\nEach basketball court costs $150,000, so to find out how many can be built with $1,000,000, I'll divide the remaining budget by the cost per court:\n\n$1,000,000 / $150,000 = 6.666...\n\nSince you can't build a fraction of a basketball court, the city can build 6 basketball courts.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the annual maintenance cost for the entire complex. The maintenance costs are:\n\n- Soccer field: $20,000 per year\n\n- Each basketball court: $10,000 per year\n\n- Swimming pool: $50,000 per year\n\nSo, the total annual maintenance cost would be:\n\n$20,000 (soccer field) + (6 courts * $10,000 per court) + $50,000 (swimming pool)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n$20,000 + (6 * $10,000) + $50,000 = $20,000 + $60,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 per year\n\nSo, the annual maintenance cost for the entire complex would be $130,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe city can build 6 basketball courts, and the annual maintenance cost for the entire complex would be $130,000."
