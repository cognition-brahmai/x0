So, I can't distinguish between the smell of a rose and a lily. However, I can tell you that roses and lilies have distinct scents that are often described differently. Roses are often associated with a sweet, floral aroma, while lilies have a more delicate and sometimes slightly minty or citrusy fragrance. But again, I can't experience these smells myself."
