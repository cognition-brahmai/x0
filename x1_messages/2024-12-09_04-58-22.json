        "content": "So there are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in a box, making a total of 10 balls. I need to pick two balls at random without looking and find out the probability that I picked one ball of each color. Okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the scenarios where I pick one red and one blue ball, and the total possible outcomes are all the different ways I can pick any two balls from the box.\n\nAlright, so let's figure out the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm picking two balls out of ten, and the order doesn't matter (because I'm just picking them without looking, and I'm not concerned with which one I picked first), this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick two balls out of ten is C(10, 2). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 possible ways to pick any two balls from the box.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is picking one red and one blue ball. There are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls.\n\nTo pick one red and one blue, I can pick any one of the 4 red balls and any one of the 6 blue balls. Since the order doesn't matter, I can use the combination formula again.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one red ball out of four is C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one blue ball out of six is C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is 4 \u00d7 6 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking one ball of each color is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 24 / 45.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: 24 \u00f7 3 = 8, and 45 \u00f7 3 = 15. So, the simplified fraction is 8/15.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability of picking a red ball first and then a blue ball, plus the probability of picking a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball first is 4/10, since there are 4 red balls out of 10.\n\nThen, given that I picked a red ball first, there are now 9 balls left in the box, with 6 of them being blue. So, the probability of picking a blue ball second is 6/9.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball first is 6/10, and then picking a red ball second is 4/9.\n\nSo, the total probability of picking one of each color is (4/10 \u00d7 6/9) + (6/10 \u00d7 4/9).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 4/10 \u00d7 6/9 = (4 \u00d7 6) / (10 \u00d7 9) = 24 / 90.\n\nSecond, 6/10 \u00d7 4/9 = (6 \u00d7 4) / (10 \u00d7 9) = 24 / 90.\n\nSo, total probability is 24/90 + 24/90 = 48/90.\n\nSimplifying 48/90 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6: 48 \u00f7 6 = 8, and 90 \u00f7 6 = 15. So, it's again 8/15.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. So, the probability is 8/15.\n\nIs there another way to look at this to confirm? Maybe using permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf I consider the order matters, then the total number of ways to pick two balls out of ten is P(10, 2) = 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes would be the number of ways to pick a red ball and then a blue ball, plus the number of ways to pick a blue ball and then a red ball.\n\nSo, picking red first: 4 options, then blue: 6 options, so 4 \u00d7 6 = 24.\n\nPicking blue first: 6 options, then red: 4 options, so 6 \u00d7 4 = 24.\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 24 + 24 = 48.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 48 / 90, which simplifies to 8/15 again.\n\nAlright, so no matter which approach I take, I keep getting 8/15 as the probability.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there a chance that the balls are identical except for their color, or does it matter? No, since we're only concerned with the color, the individual identities of the balls don't matter beyond their color.\n\nAlso, since the picking is without replacement (I pick two balls at once, not one after the other), but in the calculations above, whether I consider it as picking two at once or one after the other without replacement, the result should be the same, which it is.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the balls are being picked randomly, meaning each ball has an equal chance of being picked. The problem says \"at random without looking,\" so yes, each ball should have an equal probability of being selected.\n\nSo, I think 8/15 is the correct probability.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's a possibility of picking two red balls or two blue balls, and see if that affects anything.\n\nThe probability of picking two red balls would be C(4, 2) / C(10, 2) = (6) / (45) = 2/15.\n\nThe probability of picking two blue balls would be C(6, 2) / C(10, 2) = (15) / (45) = 1/3.\n\nAdding those up: 2/15 + 1/3 = 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15.\n\nThen, the probability of picking one of each color would be 1 - (probability of both red + probability of both blue) = 1 - 7/15 = 8/15.\n\nAgain, it confirms the same answer.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the probability is 8/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{15}} \\]"
