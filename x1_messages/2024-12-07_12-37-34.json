        "content": "Let's see. So, I have this problem about a bacteria colony that doubles in size every hour. I start with one bacterium at noon, and I need to figure out how many there will be at midnight. Okay, first things first, I need to understand the time frame here.\n\nFrom noon to midnight, that's 12 hours, right? Because midnight is 12:00 a.m., which is 12 hours after 12:00 p.m. So, the colony doubles every hour for 12 hours.\n\nNow, if the colony doubles every hour, that means each hour the number of bacteria is multiplied by 2. Starting with 1 bacterium, after the first hour, there will be 1 * 2 = 2 bacteria. After the second hour, 2 * 2 = 4 bacteria, and so on.\n\nThis sounds like exponential growth, where the quantity increases by a fixed ratio at regular time intervals. In this case, the ratio is 2, and the time interval is 1 hour.\n\nSo, the general formula for exponential growth like this is:\n\n\\[ N = N_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the final amount,\n\n- \\( N_0 \\) is the initial amount,\n\n- \\( t \\) is the elapsed time,\n\n- \\( T \\) is the doubling time.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( N_0 = 1 \\) bacterium,\n\n- \\( t = 12 \\) hours,\n\n- \\( T = 1 \\) hour.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ N = 1 \\times 2^{(12/1)} = 2^{12} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 2^{12} \\). Let's see:\n\n\\[ 2^1 = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^5 = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^6 = 64 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^8 = 256 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^9 = 512 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{10} = 1024 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{11} = 2048 \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{12} = 4096 \\]\n\nSo, at midnight, there will be 4096 bacteria.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to think about it. Since the colony doubles every hour, after each hour, the number of bacteria is:\n\n- Start: 1\n\n- After 1 hour: 2\n\n- After 2 hours: 4\n\n- After 3 hours: 8\n\n- After 4 hours: 16\n\n- After 5 hours: 32\n\n- After 6 hours: 64\n\n- After 7 hours: 128\n\n- After 8 hours: 256\n\n- After 9 hours: 512\n\n- After 10 hours: 1024\n\n- After 11 hours: 2048\n\n- After 12 hours: 4096\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier. So, the answer should be 4096 bacteria at midnight.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. The problem doesn't mention any limitations on growth, such as space or food constraints, so we can assume that the bacteria can keep doubling every hour without any problems.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I'm considering the correct time frame. If I start at noon, and go to midnight, that's indeed 12 hours later. But just to clarify, midnight is 12:00 a.m., which is 12 hours after 12:00 p.m. (noon). So, the time difference is 12 hours.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. The colony doubles every hour for 12 hours, starting with 1 bacterium, resulting in \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\) bacteria at midnight.\n\nI think that's the answer."
