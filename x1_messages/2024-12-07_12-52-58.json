        "content": "Let's see, this sounds like a riddle. The clue is: \"Each morning I appear to lie at your feet, all day I follow no matter how fast you run. Yet I nearly perish in the midday sun.\" Hmm, interesting.\n\nSo, something appears in the morning at your feet and follows you all day, but it's affected by the midday sun. Maybe it's a shadow? Shadows appear in the morning, follow you wherever you go, and are less pronounced or even disappear at midday when the sun is directly overhead.\n\nLet me think about that. Shadows do lie at your feet, and they do follow you no matter how fast you run. And in the midday sun, when the sun is highest, shadows are shortest or nonexistent if you're in direct sunlight. That seems to fit the riddle.\n\nBut maybe there are other possibilities. Could it be something like a pet that follows you around? But pets don't necessarily lie at your feet in the morning, and they don't perish in the midday sun. Actually, pets need shade in the midday sun to stay cool.\n\nOr maybe it's something abstract, like a problem or worry that follows you all day. But that doesn't really lie at your feet in the morning, and it doesn't perish in the midday sun.\n\nWait, perhaps it's your reflection in a body of water. In the morning, you might see your reflection in a pond or lake at your feet, and it follows you as you move. But in the midday sun, with glare, the reflection might be harder to see or seem to disappear. That could be a possibility.\n\nAnother thought: could it be\u6668\u9732, like dewdrops on the ground in the morning? They lie at your feet, and as the day progresses and the sun gets higher, they evaporate. But do they follow you all day? Not really, because they're stationary unless you consider that you're always passing by more dewdrops as you move, but that seems like a stretch.\n\nWhat about your footsteps? In the morning, your footsteps lie at your feet, and they follow you all day wherever you go. But footsteps don't perish in the midday sun; they're just marks on the ground that might stay there regardless of the time of day.\n\nI think the shadow makes the most sense. It appears in the morning at your feet, follows you all day, and is affected by the midday sun. So, my answer is a shadow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{shadow}} \\]"
