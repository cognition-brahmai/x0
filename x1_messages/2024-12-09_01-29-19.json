        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. Implementing an LRU cache in Go is a great way to manage a fixed-size cache efficiently. I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what an LRU cache is. LRU stands for Least Recently Used, which is a caching strategy where the least recently accessed items are removed first when the cache reaches its maximum capacity. This approach is useful in scenarios where you have a limited amount of fast memory and need to decide which data to keep readily accessible.\n\nIn Go, we can implement an LRU cache using a combination of a map for quick lookups and a doubly linked list to maintain the order of recently used items. The map will store the keys and pointers to their corresponding nodes in the linked list, allowing us to quickly access and update the usage order.\n\nHere's a basic outline of the steps we'll take:\n\n1. Define a structure to represent the cache, including the maximum capacity, the current size, a map for key to node mappings, and pointers to the head and tail of the doubly linked list.\n\n2. Create a structure for the nodes in the doubly linked list, which will hold the key, value, and pointers to the previous and next nodes.\n\n3. Implement methods to add a new key-value pair to the cache. If the cache is at full capacity, remove the least recently used item (the one at the tail of the list) before adding the new item.\n\n4. Implement a method to retrieve a value by key, updating the usage order by moving the accessed node to the front of the list.\n\n5. Optionally, implement a method to remove a key-value pair from the cache.\n\nLet's start by defining the cache structure and the node structure.\n\n```go\ntype node struct {\n    key         interface{}\n    value       interface{}\n    prev, next  *node\n}\n\ntype LRUCache struct {\n    capacity    int\n    size        int\n    cache       map[interface{}]*node\n    head, tail  *node\n}\n```\n\nIn this structure:\n\n- `node` represents each entry in the cache, holding the key, value, and pointers to the previous and next nodes.\n\n- `LRUCache` holds the cache's capacity, current size, a map for quick lookups, and pointers to the head and tail of the doubly linked list. The head of the list represents the most recently used item, while the tail represents the least recently used item.\n\nNext, we need to initialize the cache. We'll create a constructor function for this purpose.\n\n```go\nfunc NewLRUCache(capacity int) *LRUCache {\n    if capacity <= 0 {\n        panic(\"Capacity must be positive\")\n    }\n    cache := &LRUCache{\n        capacity: capacity,\n        cache:    make(map[interface{}]*node),\n    }\n    // Initialize head and tail sentinels\n    cache.head = &node{}\n    cache.tail = &node{}\n    cache.head.next = cache.tail\n    cache.tail.prev = cache.head\n    return cache\n}\n```\n\nHere, we create a new `LRUCache` with the specified capacity. We also set up sentinels for the head and tail of the list to simplify operations like additions and deletions.\n\nNow, let's implement the method to add a new key-value pair to the cache.\n\n```go\nfunc (c *LRUCache) Set(key, value interface{}) {\n    if node, found := c.cache[key]; found {\n        // Key already exists, update the value and move to front\n        node.value = value\n        c.moveToFront(node)\n        return\n    }\n    if c.size >= c.capacity {\n        // Cache is full, remove the least recently used item\n        deletedKey := c.removeTail()\n        delete(c.cache, deletedKey)\n        c.size--\n    }\n    // Add new node to front\n    newNode := &node{key: key, value: value}\n    c.cache[key] = newNode\n    c.addToFront(newNode)\n    c.size++\n}\n```\n\nIn this method:\n\n- If the key already exists, we update its value and move the node to the front of the list to mark it as recently used.\n\n- If the cache is full, we remove the least recently used item (the one at the tail) before adding the new item.\n\n- We add the new node to the front of the list and update the cache map.\n\nWe need to implement helper methods to move a node to the front, add a node to the front, and remove a node from the list.\n\n```go\nfunc (c *LRUCache) addToFront(n *node) {\n    n.prev = c.head\n    n.next = c.head.next\n    c.head.next.prev = n\n    c.head.next = n\n}\n\nfunc (c *LRUCache) removeNode(n *node) {\n    n.prev.next = n.next\n    n.next.prev = n.prev\n}\n\nfunc (c *LRUCache) moveToFront(n *node) {\n    c.removeNode(n)\n    c.addToFront(n)\n}\n\nfunc (c *LRUCache) removeTail() interface{} {\n    lastNode := c.tail.prev\n    c.removeNode(lastNode)\n    return lastNode.key\n}\n```\n\nThese helper methods allow us to manipulate the doubly linked list efficiently.\n\nNext, we implement the method to retrieve a value by key.\n\n```go\nfunc (c *LRUCache) Get(key interface{}) (interface{}, bool) {\n    if node, found := c.cache[key]; found {\n        // Move the accessed node to front\n        c.moveToFront(node)\n        return node.value, true\n    }\n    return nil, false\n}\n```\n\nIn this method, if the key exists, we move its node to the front of the list to mark it as recently used and return its value. If the key doesn't exist, we return nil and false.\n\nOptionally, you can implement a method to remove a key-value pair from the cache.\n\n```go\nfunc (c *LRUCache) Remove(key interface{}) {\n    if node, found := c.cache[key]; found {\n        c.removeNode(node)\n        delete(c.cache, key)\n        c.size--\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis method removes the specified key from the cache if it exists.\n\nThat's the basic implementation of an LRU cache in Go. You can further enhance this by adding more features, such as getting the current size of the cache, checking if the cache is full, or iterating over the cache items.\n\nHere's a simple example of how to use this cache:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    cache := NewLRUCache(2)\n    cache.Set(\"one\", 1)\n    cache.Set(\"two\", 2)\n    value, found := cache.Get(\"one\")\n    if found {\n        fmt.Println(\"Got one:\", value)\n    }\n    cache.Set(\"three\", 3) // This will remove the least recently used item\n    value, found = cache.Get(\"two\")\n    if !found {\n        fmt.Println(\"Two is expired\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a cache with a capacity of 2, add two items, retrieve one item to make it most recently used, add a third item which causes the least recently used item to be removed, and then check for an item that should have been removed.\n\nI hope this helps you implement an LRU cache in Go!

]liath, might go to Red Rocket or Blue Bolt, expecting Sarah to be there.\n\nAlternatively, if David is finished with Green Goliath and has nothing else planned, he might go to Blue Bolt to meet their parents and perhaps look for Sarah there.\n\nFrom Sarah's perspective, if she checks Green Goliath and doesn't find David, she might go to Red Rocket next, and then to Blue Bolt.\n\nDavid, if he's at Red Rocket, might see Sarah there, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, if David is at Blue Bolt, and Sarah goes there after checking Green Goliath and Red Rocket, they might find each other there.\n\nThis seems like a plausible sequence of events.\n\nAnother factor to consider is communication between Sarah and David. Do they have a way to contact each other, like cell phones, or do they have to rely on finding each other in person?\n\nIf they can call or text each other, that changes things significantly. But the problem doesn't mention any communication devices, so perhaps they have to find each other physically.\n\nGiven that, their best bet is to check the likely locations where the other might be.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Sarah checks Green Goliath first, as that's where David was last known to be.\n\n- If not there, she goes to Red Rocket, then to Blue Bolt.\n\n- David, after riding Green Goliath, might go to Red Rocket or Blue Bolt, expecting Sarah to be there.\n\n- They should eventually find each other at one of these locations.\n\nAlternatively, if the amusement park is large, they might consider meeting at a central location or a landmark within the park.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify any such landmark, perhaps the roller coasters are the main points of reference.\n\nIn conclusion, Sarah will likely check Green Goliath first, then Red Rocket, and then Blue Bolt to find David.\n\nDavid, meanwhile, might expect Sarah to look for him at Green Goliath or Red Rocket, and accordingly choose to go to one of those locations to meet her.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable approach for them to reunite.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Sarah will likely check Green Goliath first, then Red Rocket, and then Blue Bolt to find David. David might expect Sarah to look for him at Green Goliath or Red Rocket and go to one of those locations to meet her.}} \\]"
