        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units every day, and it operates for 6 days a week, taking one day off. We need to find out how many units it produces in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many units are produced in one week. Since it works 6 days a week, and produces 500 units each day, I can multiply 500 by 6.\n\n500 units/day * 6 days/week = 3000 units/week\n\nSo, in one week, the factory produces 3000 units.\n\nNow, to find out the production for 4 weeks, I can multiply the weekly production by 4.\n\n3000 units/week * 4 weeks = 12,000 units\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 12,000 units in 4 weeks.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? The factory takes one day off each week, but since that's already accounted for by using 6 days a week, I think that's fine.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\n500 units/day * 6 days = 3000 units/week\n\n3000 units/week * 4 weeks = 12,000 units\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 12,000 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12000} \\]"
