        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular garden, and it's said to be 3 times longer than it is wide. Also, the perimeter is 80 meters. We need to find the length of the garden.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a rectangle is. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, right? So, opposite sides are equal. The longer sides are called lengths, and the shorter sides are called widths.\n\nNow, the problem says the garden is 3 times longer than it is wide. That means the length is 3 times the width. So, if we let the width be, say, W meters, then the length would be 3W meters.\n\nNext, we know the perimeter of the rectangle is 80 meters. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since there are two lengths and two widths, the formula for the perimeter P is:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nWhere L is the length and W is the width.\n\nNow, substituting the values we have:\n\n80 = 2*(3W) + 2*W\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n80 = 6W + 2W\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n80 = 8W\n\nNow, to find W, we divide both sides by 8:\n\nW = 80 / 8\n\nW = 10 meters\n\nSo, the width is 10 meters. Now, since the length is 3 times the width, L = 3*10 = 30 meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Perimeter is 2L plus 2W, which is 2*30 plus 2*10, that's 60 plus 20, which equals 80 meters. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for perimeter and substituted L = 3W directly:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nGiven L = 3W, so:\n\nP = 2*(3W) + 2W = 6W + 2W = 8W\n\nGiven P = 80 meters:\n\n8W = 80\n\nW = 10 meters\n\nThen L = 3W = 30 meters.\n\nSo, the length of the garden is 30 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
