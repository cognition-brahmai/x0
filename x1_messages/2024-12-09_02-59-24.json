Born into slavery, she escaped and subsequently made some thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved people, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad.\n\nHarriet is often portrayed as a symbol of courage and freedom. Despite the constant threat of being captured or killed, she risked her life multiple times to help others escape from the clutches of slavery. She was not only brave but also highly strategic and resourceful, utilizing a variety of tactics to avoid detection during her rescue missions.\n\nShe was deeply religious and believed that her actions were guided by divine visions. Her faith gave her strength in the face of immense adversity and danger. It also inspired her to fight for justice and equality, not just through direct action but also through her work as a speaker and advocate for women's suffrage later in her life.\n\nDespite living most of her life in poverty, Harriet Tubman remained selfless and dedicated to helping others. She used her own home as a haven for those in need and continued to champion the cause of civil rights until her death.\nDavid: If you are facing north, is Washington D.C. to your left or right?"

        "content": "If I'm facing north, Washington D.C. would be to my south. So, if I turn around to face south, D.C. would be straight ahead. But since the question is about left or right when facing north, and D.C. is south, it's neither left nor right, but directly behind me if I'm facing north. Wait, no, if I'm facing north, south is behind me. So, D.C., being south, would be behind me. But the question is about left or right, so maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that I'm standing somewhere and facing north. Washington D.C. is south of here, so if I turn around to face south, D.C. is straight ahead. But the question is, from my original position facing north, is D.C. to my left or right?\n\nActually, directionally, if you're facing north, east is to your right, and west is to your left. But since D.C. is south, which is behind you when facing north, it's neither left nor right. Maybe the question is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the person asking the question is at a specific location facing north and wants to know, relative to that direction, where D.C. is. For example, if someone is in New York facing north, D.C. would be to their southwest. But facing north, southwest would be to their left.\n\nHold on, if you're facing north, southwest is to your left. So, if D.C. is southwest from your location, then yes, it would be to your left.\n\nBut this assumes that you're somewhere north of D.C., like in New York or Boston. If you're west of D.C., say in Chicago, and facing north, D.C. would be to your east, which would be to your right.\n\nSo, the answer depends on where you are relative to D.C.\n\nMaybe the question assumes you're in a specific place, like the north, facing D.C. which is south. But as I thought earlier, south is behind you when facing north.\n\nPerhaps the question is unclear, or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me try to simplify: if you're facing north, directions to your left and right are west and east, respectively.\n\nSo, left is west, right is east.\n\nIf D.C. is to your left, it's west of you; if it's to your right, it's east.\n\nBut actually, Washington D.C. is located approximately at 38.9072\u00b0 N, 77.0369\u00b0 W.\n\nSo, depending on where you are, it could be to your left or right when facing north.\n\nFor instance, if you're west of D.C., say in Denver (which is around 39.7392\u00b0 N, 104.9903\u00b0 W), and you face north, D.C. would be to your east, so to your right.\n\nIf you're east of D.C., say in Boston (42.3601\u00b0 N, 71.0589\u00b0 W), and face north, D.C. would be to your west, so to your left.\n\nIf you're north of D.C., say in Toronto (43.6532\u00b0 N, 79.3832\u00b0 W), and face north, D.C. would be to your south, directly behind you.\n\nIf you're south of D.C., say in Miami (25.7617\u00b0 N, 80.1918\u00b0 W), and face north, D.C. would be to your north, straight ahead.\n\nWait, but the question specifies facing north, so in Miami, facing north, D.C. is north of you, straight ahead.\n\nIn Toronto, facing north, D.C. is to your south, behind you.\n\nIn Denver, facing north, D.C. is to your east, right side.\n\nIn Boston, facing north, D.C. is to your west, left side.\n\nSo, without a specific starting point, it's impossible to give a definitive answer.\n\nMaybe the question assumes you're in a particular place, like the middle of the country, but even then, it varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is metaphorical, but that seems unlikely.\n\nI think the best answer is that it depends on your current location relative to D.C.\n\nBut maybe there's a standard answer based on the most common reference point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about facing north in a specific context, like standing at a particular landmark.\n\nGiven that, I'm going to say that, generally, if you're in the continental U.S. and facing north, Washington D.C. can be to your left or right, depending on your location.\n\nBut to give a specific answer, I need to know where you are.\n\nSince the question doesn't specify, I'll assume that, for most people in the U.S., D.C. is either to the east or west, so to your right or left when facing north.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: it varies depending on your location.\n\nBut if pressed for a single answer, I'd say it's to your left or right, but specify that it depends.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about a map, with north at the top, and D.C. is to the left or right.\n\nBut the question specifies \"if you are facing north,\" which suggests a personal orientation rather than a map orientation.\n\nIn any case, I think the answer is that it depends on your location.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{It depends on your location; Washington D.C. can be to your left or right when facing north, depending on where you are.}} \\]"
