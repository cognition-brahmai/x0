However, I can provide you with general information about cities that receive little to no sunlight during certain periods of the year. For example, cities located in polar regions, such as Barrow (now known as Utqiagvik) in Alaska, experience months of complete darkness during the winter season, known as polar night. Similarly, places near the Arctic Circle like Troms\u00f8 in Norway have long periods with minimal sunlight in winter. It's important to note that these areas also experience extreme sunlight during the summer months, known as the midnight sun. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
