        "content": "The first woman to win a Nobel Prize in both Physics and Chemistry for her pioneering research on radioactivity was Marie Curie. She was a Polish-born French physicist and chemist who made groundbreaking contributions to the understanding of radioactivity. In 1903, she shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity. Then, in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. Marie Curie remains the only person to have been awarded Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields."
