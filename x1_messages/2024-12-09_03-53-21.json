        "content": "In Greek mythology, the river that souls must cross to reach Hades is the River Styx. However, to be more precise regarding your question, it's actually the River Acheron that is often referred to as the \"river of woe\" and is one of the five rivers surrounding the underworld. Souls would gather at its edge, and the ferryman Charon would transport them across to the realm of Hades. So, while the River Styx is a significant river in the underworld associated with oaths and punishments, it's the River Acheron that souls cross with Charon's help.\n\nBut to clarify further, in some accounts, there are multiple rivers that souls might encounter in the underworld, including the Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon, Lethe, and Cocytus. Each has its own significance:\n\n- **Acheron**: Often considered the primary river that souls cross to enter Hades.\n\n- **Styx**: Known for its toxic waters and is where gods swear oaths.\n\n- **Phlegethon**: A river of fire.\n\n- **Lethe**: The river of forgetfulness, where souls would drink to erase their memories before being reincarnated.\n\n- **Cocytus**: The river of wailing, associated with lamentation and grief.\n\nSo, while the River Styx is famous, it's the River Acheron that is most directly associated with Charon's ferry service.\n\n**Addendum:**\n\nGiven the complexity of Greek mythology and the variations in different accounts, it's essential to note that representations of the underworld and its features can differ among various sources. Both the Rivers Acheron and Styx play significant roles, but in the context of souls crossing over with Charon, Acheron is more commonly cited."
