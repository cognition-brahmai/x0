The expression is (8 * 4) / (2^3) - 5.\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, parentheses first. There are two sets: (8 * 4) and (2^3).\n\nLet's calculate (8 * 4):\n\n8 * 4 = 32\n\nNext, (2^3):\n\n2 raised to the power of 3 is 2 * 2 * 2, which equals 8.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to:\n\n32 / 8 - 5\n\nNext, division and subtraction from left to right.\n\n32 divided by 8 is 4.\n\nSo now we have:\n\n4 - 5\n\nFinally, 4 minus 5 equals -1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-1} \\]"
