        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. A website gets 10,000 visits per day, and each visitor views an average of 3 pages. I need to find out the total number of page views in a year, assuming a year has 365 days. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many page views there are per day. Since each of the 10,000 visitors views an average of 3 pages, I can multiply the number of visitors by the average number of pages per visitor to get the daily page views.\n\nSo, daily page views = number of visitors per day \u00d7 average pages per visitor\nThat would be 10,000 visitors/day \u00d7 3 pages/visitor = 30,000 pages/day.\n\nNow, to find out the annual page views, I need to multiply the daily page views by the number of days in a year. Assuming a year has 365 days, I can calculate:\n\nAnnual page views = daily page views \u00d7 number of days in a year\nSo, 30,000 pages/day \u00d7 365 days/year = ?\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 30,000 times 365.\n\nFirst, 30,000 \u00d7 300 = 9,000,000\n\nThen, 30,000 \u00d7 60 = 1,800,000\n\nFinally, 30,000 \u00d7 5 = 150,000\n\nNow, adding those up: 9,000,000 + 1,800,000 = 10,800,000\n\nThen, 10,800,000 + 150,000 = 10,950,000\n\nSo, the total number of page views in a year is 10,950,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again: 10,000 visitors/day \u00d7 3 pages/visitor = 30,000 pages/day.\n\n30,000 pages/day \u00d7 365 days/year = 30,000 \u00d7 365.\n\nI can also think of it as 30,000 \u00d7 365 = 30,000 \u00d7 (300 + 60 + 5) = (30,000 \u00d7 300) + (30,000 \u00d7 60) + (30,000 \u00d7 5) = 9,000,000 + 1,800,000 + 150,000 = 10,950,000.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply 10,000 by 3 to get 30,000, and then multiply by 365 to get 10,950,000.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that 30,000 pages per day for 365 days is the same as 30,000 \u00d7 365.\n\nI can also calculate it as 30,000 \u00d7 365 = 30,000 \u00d7 365.\n\nLet me verify with another method. I know that 30,000 \u00d7 365 is the same as 30,000 \u00d7 (300 + 60 + 5) = 9,000,000 + 1,800,000 + 150,000 = 10,950,000.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 30,000 \u00d7 365, I can break it down further.\n\n30,000 \u00d7 300 = 9,000,000\n\n30,000 \u00d7 60 = 1,800,000\n\n30,000 \u00d7 5 = 150,000\n\nAdding them up gives 10,950,000.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 30,000 as 3 \u00d7 10,000, so 3 \u00d7 10,000 \u00d7 365 = 3 \u00d7 3,650,000 = 10,950,000.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\n30,000 = 3 \u00d7 10,000\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 10,000 \u00d7 365 = 3 \u00d7 3,650,000 = 10,950,000.\n\nYeah, that checks out.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The total number of page views in a year is 10,950,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10950000} \\]\n"
