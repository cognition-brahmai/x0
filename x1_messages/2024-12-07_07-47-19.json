        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses in a row, and the first one is blue. Then, each next house alternates between red and blue. So, starting with blue, the sequence would be blue, red, blue, red, and so on. And it's given that the last house is also blue.\n\nSo, if there are 10 houses, and the first and the last are both blue, we need to figure out how many of them are red.\n\nLet me list them out to see the pattern:\n\n1. Blue\n\n2. Red\n\n3. Blue\n\n4. Red\n\n5. Blue\n\n6. Red\n\n7. Blue\n\n8. Red\n\n9. Blue\n\n10. Red\n\nWait, but it says the last house is blue, and in this sequence, house number 10 is red. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let's try again.\n\nIf the first house is blue, and they alternate, then:\n\n1. Blue\n\n2. Red\n\n3. Blue\n\n4. Red\n\n5. Blue\n\n6. Red\n\n7. Blue\n\n8. Red\n\n9. Blue\n\n10. Red\n\nAgain, house 10 is red, but the problem says the last house is blue. So something's not right here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the alternating pattern is different. Let's see.\n\nIf the first house is blue, and then they alternate, then house 2 should be red, house 3 blue, house 4 red, and so on, ending with house 10 being red. But the problem states that the last house is blue, which contradicts this pattern.\n\nUnless... unless the alternating pattern is different in some way. Maybe it's not strictly alternating from the first house.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first house is blue, and then they alternate, but the alternating pattern might be based on pairs or something.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the houses alternate, but starting from the first house being blue, and ending with the last house being blue.\n\nSo, if there are 10 houses, and both the first and the last are blue, then in between, they alternate.\n\nLet's try to see the sequence again:\n\n1. Blue\n\n2. Red\n\n3. Blue\n\n4. Red\n\n5. Blue\n\n6. Red\n\n7. Blue\n\n8. Red\n\n9. Blue\n\n10. Red\n\nBut again, house 10 is red, which contradicts the given information.\n\nUnless... maybe the alternating pattern isn't strictly every other house, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the houses alternate in a different manner.\n\nWait, maybe the first house is blue, and then each subsequent house alternates, but the alternation is based on the previous house's color.\n\nSo, starting with blue, next is red, then blue, red, and so on.\n\nBut again, that would make the 10th house red, which doesn't match.\n\nUnless... there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the houses don't strictly alternate; maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first house is blue, and then they alternate, but the last house is forced to be blue, regardless of the alternation.\n\nBut that would mean that the pattern is broken at the last house.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alternation is such that no two adjacent houses have the same color, except for the first and the last being blue.\n\nBut in that case, with 10 houses, starting and ending with blue, we can determine the number of red houses.\n\nLet me think of it in terms of a sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s denote B for blue and R for red.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\nHouse 1: B\n\nHouse 2: R\n\nHouse 3: B\n\nHouse 4: R\n\nHouse 5: B\n\nHouse 6: R\n\nHouse 7: B\n\nHouse 8: R\n\nHouse 9: B\n\nHouse 10: R\n\nBut house 10 should be B according to the problem.\n\nSo, perhaps the alternation is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first house is blue, and then they alternate, but the alternation is such that every even-numbered house is red, and every odd-numbered house is blue.\n\nIn that case, houses 1,3,5,7,9 are blue, and houses 2,4,6,8,10 are red.\n\nBut again, house 10 would be red, which contradicts the problem.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alternation is not strict, or there's a cycle beyond two colors.\n\nBut the problem mentions only red and blue houses, alternating.\n\nWait, perhaps the alternation is between red and blue, starting with blue, but with the last house being blue as well.\n\nSo, in a sequence of 10 houses, starting and ending with blue, alternating in between.\n\nLet me try to think of it as a circular arrangement, but it's a row, so probably not circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is such that houses 1 and 10 are both blue, and the alternation is maintained as much as possible in between.\n\nIn that case, perhaps houses 1,3,5,7,9 are blue, and houses 2,4,6,8,10 are red.\n\nBut again, house 10 is red, which contradicts the given information.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm assuming a strict alternation, but the last house being blue breaks the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alternation rule doesn't apply to the last house, and it's forced to be blue.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the houses alternate strictly, and since the first is blue and the last is blue, the number of houses must be such that the sequence ends with blue.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the position.\n\nIf the first house is blue, and they alternate, then:\n\n- Odd-numbered houses are blue.\n\n- Even-numbered houses are red.\n\nBut then house 10, which is even, would be red, but the problem says it's blue.\n\nSo, perhaps this assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alternation is between red and blue, starting with blue, but with every house being blue in certain positions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the first house is blue, and then they alternate, but since the last house is also blue, maybe there's an even number of red houses.\n\nWait, with 10 houses, starting with blue and ending with blue, perhaps there are 4 red houses and 6 blue houses.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIf house 1 is blue, house 2 is red, house 3 is blue, house 4 is red, house 5 is blue, house 6 is red, house 7 is blue, house 8 is red, house 9 is blue, house 10 is red.\n\nBut house 10 is supposed to be blue, not red.\n\nSo, perhaps one of the houses deviates from the alternation pattern to make house 10 blue.\n\nBut that seems like an exception, and perhaps the alternation isn't perfect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alternation is based on a different pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the houses alternate starting from the second house.\n\nFor example, house 1 is blue, house 2 is red, house 3 is blue, house 4 is red, and so on, up to house 10 being blue.\n\nBut in this case, house 10 would be blue only if the alternation pattern is such that even positions are red and odd positions are blue, but house 10 is even and would be red.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alternation is not strictly between red and blue, but there's a cycle of colors.\n\nBut the problem mentions only red and blue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alternation is based on pairs of houses.\n\nFor example, houses 1 and 2 are blue and red, houses 3 and 4 are blue and red, and so on, with house 10 being blue.\n\nBut in this case, house 10 would be blue, and house 9 would be red.\n\nWait, let's try that:\n\nHouses: 1-B, 2-R, 3-B, 4-R, 5-B, 6-R, 7-B, 8-R, 9-B, 10-R.\n\nAgain, house 10 is red, but it should be blue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe houses 1 and 2 are blue and red, houses 3 and 4 are red and blue, and so on, alternating the starting color every two houses.\n\nBut that seems arbitrary and not following a simple alternation rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alternation is based on a different pattern altogether.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm thinking in terms of a simple alternation, but perhaps the alternation is in a different manner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the houses alternate strictly, and the only way for the last house to be blue is if there's an odd number of houses, but there are 10 houses, which is even.\n\nWait, but 10 is even, and starting with blue, if we alternate strictly, we should have house 10 being red.\n\nBut the problem says it's blue, which contradicts this.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps the alternation isn't strict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alternation is such that no three consecutive houses are the same color, but that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alternation is based on a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the alternation is that each house is a different color from the previous one, except for the last house, which must be blue regardless.\n\nIn that case, the sequence would be:\n\nHouse 1: B\n\nHouse 2: R\n\nHouse 3: B\n\nHouse 4: R\n\nHouse 5: B\n\nHouse 6: R\n\nHouse 7: B\n\nHouse 8: R\n\nHouse 9: B\n\nHouse 10: B\n\nWait a minute, if house 9 is blue, and house 10 is also blue, that breaks the alternation pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the last house is an exception.\n\nIn this case, houses 1 through 9 alternate strictly, with house 9 being blue, and house 10 being blue as well.\n\nBut that means houses 9 and 10 are both blue, which breaks the alternation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alternation rule applies only to adjacent houses except for the last house.\n\nIn that case, houses 1 through 9 alternate strictly, and house 10 is blue, regardless of the previous house.\n\nIn this scenario, houses 1,3,5,7,9,10 are blue, and houses 2,4,6,8 are red.\n\nSo, there are 4 red houses and 6 blue houses.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the first house is blue and the last house is blue, with alternation in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alternation is such that between any two adjacent houses, the colors alternate, and the first and last are both blue.\n\nIn that case, for 10 houses, the number of red houses would be 4.\n\nWait, but in the sequence I just thought of:\n\nHouses: B,R,B,R,B,R,B,R,B,B\n\nHere, houses 2,4,6,8 are red, and houses 1,3,5,7,9,10 are blue.\n\nSo, 4 red houses.\n\nBut in this sequence, houses 9 and 10 are both blue, which breaks the alternation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the alternation rule is followed as much as possible, with the last house being blue.\n\nIn that case, perhaps there are 4 red houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the houses alternate starting from the first house, and the last house being blue is a given, so we have to accept that the alternation might not hold strictly.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the number of red houses is 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are 5 red houses and 5 blue houses, but that would mean the last house is red, which contradicts the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are 4 red houses and 6 blue houses.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think there are 4 red houses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
