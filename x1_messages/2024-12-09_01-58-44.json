        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets at a constant rate, and in 5 hours, it fills 3 crates. I need to find out how many crates will be filled after 12 hours.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the rate at which the factory produces crates per hour. If in 5 hours they fill 3 crates, then the rate is 3 crates divided by 5 hours, right? So that's 3/5 crates per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how many crates are filled in 12 hours, I can multiply the rate by the time. So, crates = rate \u00d7 time = (3/5) crates/hour \u00d7 12 hours.\n\nLet me calculate that: (3/5) \u00d7 12 = (3\u00d712)/5 = 36/5 = 7.2 crates.\n\nBut crates are probably whole units, so does that mean 7 full crates and part of an eighth crate? Or should I round up to 8 crates?\n\nWait, the question is about how many crates will be filled, and it's a factory, so they might not partial crates. Maybe I need to consider only full crates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory can fill 7 full crates and have part of an eighth crate ready after 12 hours.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify if partial crates are acceptable or if they count as filled only when complete.\n\nMaybe I should assume that crates are only considered filled when complete.\n\nIn that case, even if there's a partial crate, it doesn't count as a full crate.\n\nSo, after 12 hours, the factory would have filled 7 full crates, with some widgets left over that don't fill an entire crate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory's production is such that it can produce partial crates, but the question is about how many crates are filled, implying complete crates.\n\nI think the safest approach is to assume that only complete crates are counted as filled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7 crates.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the rate is 3 crates in 5 hours, then in 12 hours, it should produce (3/5)*12 = 7.2 crates.\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a crate, and assuming only full crates are considered filled, the answer is 7 crates.\n\nAlternatively, if the factory continues producing after 12 hours and accumulates enough widgets for another crate, but that would require more time, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, based on 12 hours of production, the factory fills 7 complete crates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
