        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the train is traveling at two different speeds for different periods of time. First, it goes at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then it speeds up to 80 miles per hour for the next 3 hours. To find out how far it travels in total, I need to calculate the distance it covers in each part of the journey and then add those distances together.\n\nOkay, so for the first part, at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, the distance would be speed multiplied by time, right? So that's 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which equals 120 miles.\n\nThen, for the second part, at 80 miles per hour for 3 hours, again, distance is speed times time. So, 80 miles per hour times 3 hours equals 240 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just add those two distances together: 120 miles plus 240 miles equals 360 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider, like acceleration or stops? The problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I think it's safe to assume the train is moving at a constant speed during each segment.\n\nAlso, I should make sure about the units. The speed is given in miles per hour and time in hours, so multiplying them directly gives miles, which is what we want.\n\nSo, the total distance the train travels is 360 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
