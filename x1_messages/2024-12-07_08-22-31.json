        "content": "So the hotel is planning to open a new location with 150 rooms, and they want to allocate them into three types: standard rooms, suites, and accessible rooms. The percentages they've given are 70% for standard rooms, 20% for suites, and 10% for accessible rooms. Then, they want to know how many of each type of room that would be, and also estimate the total construction cost, given the costs per room type.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the number of each type of room. Starting with the standard rooms, which are 70% of the total 150 rooms. So, I'll multiply 150 by 70% to find that number.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of standard rooms = 150 rooms * 70%\n\nBut I know that percentages need to be converted to decimals for multiplication. So, 70% is 0.70.\n\nNumber of standard rooms = 150 * 0.70\n\nNow, calculating that:\n\n150 * 0.70 = 105\n\nSo, there will be 105 standard rooms.\n\nNext, for the suites, which are 20% of the total.\n\nNumber of suites = 150 rooms * 20%\n\nAgain, converting 20% to a decimal: 0.20\n\nNumber of suites = 150 * 0.20 = 30\n\nSo, there will be 30 suites.\n\nFinally, for the accessible rooms, which are 10% of the total.\n\nNumber of accessible rooms = 150 rooms * 10%\n\n10% as a decimal is 0.10\n\nNumber of accessible rooms = 150 * 0.10 = 15\n\nSo, there will be 15 accessible rooms.\n\nLet me just double-check that these numbers add up to the total number of rooms:\n\n105 (standard) + 30 (suites) + 15 (accessible) = 150\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nNow, for the construction costs. They've provided the cost per room type:\n\n- Standard room: $100,000\n\n- Suite: $150,000\n\n- Accessible room: $120,000\n\nI need to calculate the total cost for each type of room and then sum them up to get the total construction cost.\n\nFirst, for standard rooms:\n\nTotal cost for standard rooms = number of standard rooms * cost per standard room\n\n= 105 * $100,000\n\n= $10,500,000\n\nNext, for suites:\n\nTotal cost for suites = number of suites * cost per suite\n\n= 30 * $150,000\n\n= $4,500,000\n\nThen, for accessible rooms:\n\nTotal cost for accessible rooms = number of accessible rooms * cost per accessible room\n\n= 15 * $120,000\n\n= $1,800,000\n\nNow, to find the total construction cost, I'll add up these three amounts:\n\nTotal construction cost = $10,500,000 + $4,500,000 + $1,800,000\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n$10,500,000 + $4,500,000 = $15,000,000\n\nThen, $15,000,000 + $1,800,000 = $16,800,000\n\nSo, the total construction cost is $16,800,000.\n\nI should probably make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me verify the calculations again.\n\nFirst, number of standard rooms: 150 * 0.70 = 105. Correct.\n\nNumber of suites: 150 * 0.20 = 30. Correct.\n\nNumber of accessible rooms: 150 * 0.10 = 15. Correct.\n\nTotal rooms: 105 + 30 + 15 = 150. Correct.\n\nNow, costs:\n\nStandard rooms: 105 * $100,000 = $10,500,000. Correct.\n\nSuites: 30 * $150,000 = $4,500,000. Correct.\n\nAccessible rooms: 15 * $120,000 = $1,800,000. Correct.\n\nTotal construction cost: $10,500,000 + $4,500,000 + $1,800,000 = $16,800,000. Correct.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16800000} \\]"
