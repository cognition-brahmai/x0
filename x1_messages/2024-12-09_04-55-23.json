        "content": "So you've got this problem here: there are 12 different types of candy, and you want to buy 5 different types. You're wondering how many possible combinations you can make from these. Hmm, this sounds like a combination problem, where the order doesn't matter, right? Because it's about selecting types of candy, and it probably doesn't matter in which order you pick them.\n\nOkay, so in math, when we talk about combinations, we use the formula for combinations, which is often represented as \"n choose k.\" Here, n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So in this case, n is 12 and k is 5.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere \"!\" denotes factorial, meaning the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, 5! would be 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12!}{5!(12 - 5)!} = \\frac{12!}{5! \\times 7!}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculating 12! might be a bit tedious, but I can simplify this before calculating the factorials fully. I know that 12! is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!, so the 7! in the denominator will cancel out with the 7! in the numerator.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!}{5! \u00d7 7!} = \\frac{12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8}{5!}\n\\]\n\nNow, 5! is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 5) = \\frac{12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8}{120}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate the numerator step by step:\n\nFirst, 12 \u00d7 11 = 132.\n\nThen, 132 \u00d7 10 = 1320.\n\nNext, 1320 \u00d7 9 = 11880.\n\nThen, 11880 \u00d7 8 = 95040.\n\nSo, the numerator is 95040.\n\nNow, divide that by 120:\n\n95040 \u00f7 120.\n\nLet's see, 120 \u00d7 792 = 95040.\n\nSo, 95040 \u00f7 120 = 792.\n\nTherefore, there are 792 possible combinations of 5 different types of candy from 12 types.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5! \u00d7 7!)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!) / (120 \u00d7 7!)\n\nThe 7! cancels out:\n\n= (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / 120\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n12 \u00d7 11 = 132\n\n132 \u00d7 10 = 1320\n\n1320 \u00d7 9 = 11880\n\n11880 \u00d7 8 = 95040\n\nNow, divide by 120:\n\n95040 \u00f7 120\n\nWell, 120 \u00d7 792 = 95040, so yes, 792.\n\nAlternatively, I could have calculated it step by step:\n\n95040 \u00f7 120\n\nFirst, divide by 100: 95040 \u00f7 100 = 950.4\n\nThen, add back the decimal: actually, that's not the right way.\n\nLet me do it properly:\n\n120 \u00d7 600 = 72,000\n\nSubtract from 95,040: 95,040 - 72,000 = 23,040\n\nNow, 120 \u00d7 192 = 23,040\n\nSo, 600 + 192 = 792.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nTherefore, there are 792 possible combinations.\n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, I could use the combination formula on a calculator, but since I don't have one right now, I'll have to trust my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I know that C(10, 5) is 252, and C(12, 5) should be more than that.\n\nLet me see, C(12, 5) = 792, which is indeed greater than C(10, 5) = 252.\n\nAlso, C(11, 5) is C(10,5) + C(10,4)) according to Pascal's triangle, but I might not need that now.\n\nSo, I think 792 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, you can make 792 different combinations of 5 types of candy from 12 different types.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{792} \\]"
