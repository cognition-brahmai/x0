        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges $20 per day for renting a car, and also 15 cents per mile driven. So, there are two parts to the total cost: the daily rental fee and the mileage charge.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for renting the car for 5 days. Since it's $20 per day, we can multiply 20 by 5:\n\n20 * 5 = 100\n\nSo, the rental cost for 5 days is $100.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost for driving 300 miles, with a charge of 15 cents per mile. It's important to note that 15 cents is the same as $0.15. So, we can multiply 0.15 by 300:\n\n0.15 * 300 = 45\n\nTherefore, the mileage cost for 300 miles is $45.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, we add the rental cost and the mileage cost together:\n\n100 + 45 = 145\n\nSo, the total cost for renting the car for 5 days and driving it for 300 miles is $145.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there's a daily mileage allowance or something, but the problem doesn't mention any such thing. It simply states that there's a charge of $20 per day and 15 cents per mile driven.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 15 cents per mile is included in the $20 per day, but that seems unlikely because they've specified separate charges for daily rental and per mile driven.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total cost as a combination of fixed and variable costs. The fixed cost is the daily rental fee, which doesn't change based on how many miles you drive. The variable cost is the mileage charge, which depends on how many miles you've driven.\n\nIn this case, the fixed cost for 5 days is $100, and the variable cost for 300 miles is $45. Adding them up gives $145, which seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any additional fees or taxes that might be applied. The problem doesn't mention any extra charges, so I think it's safe to assume that the total cost is just the sum of the rental and mileage charges.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the car rental company has a minimum mileage or any discounts, but again, the problem doesn't provide any information about that, so I think we can ignore those possibilities.\n\nSo, sticking to the information given, the total cost should be $145.\n\nLet me try calculating it again to confirm.\n\nDaily rental cost: $20 per day * 5 days = $100\n\nMileage cost: $0.15 per mile * 300 miles = $45\n\nTotal cost: $100 + $45 = $145\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was trying to trick me by offering a daily mileage inclusion, but since it's not mentioned, I shouldn't assume that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $145.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{145} \\]"
