        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces 50 cars every day, and each car needs 4 tires. We want to find out how many tires are needed for a month with 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many cars the factory produces in a month. Since it makes 50 cars each day and there are 30 days in the month, I can multiply the daily production by the number of days:\n\n50 cars/day \u00d7 30 days = 1500 cars\n\nSo, the factory produces 1500 cars in a month.\n\nNext, each of these cars requires 4 tires. To find the total number of tires needed, I should multiply the number of cars by the number of tires per car:\n\n1500 cars \u00d7 4 tires/car = 6000 tires\n\nTherefore, the factory needs 6000 tires for a month's worth of car production.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the number of tires produced per day and then multiply by the number of days in the month.\n\nFirst, find the daily tire usage:\n\n50 cars/day \u00d7 4 tires/car = 200 tires/day\n\nThen, for 30 days:\n\n200 tires/day \u00d7 30 days = 6000 tires\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, 6000 tires are needed.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Let's see.\n\nPerhaps I could consider the total production in terms of tires directly. Since each car requires 4 tires, and the factory produces 50 cars a day, the tire production per day is 200 tires, as I calculated before. Extending that to 30 days still gives me 6000 tires.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the monthly car production being 1500 cars and each requiring 4 tires, multiplying gives me again 6000 tires.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this, I end up with the same number: 6000 tires.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any variables I might have missed. For example, are there any spare tires, or is there any waste or extra tires kept in stock? But based on the information given, it's just about the tires needed for the cars produced in a month, so no need to account for extras.\n\nAlso, the month has exactly 30 days, so no need to consider leap years or different month lengths.\n\nSo, my final answer is 6000 tires.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]\n"
