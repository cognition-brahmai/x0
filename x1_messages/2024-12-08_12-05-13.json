        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, I've got a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. That's a total of 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls. The first part is asking for the probability of drawing one red ball at random.\n\nOkay, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. So, for drawing one red ball, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 (since there are 5 red balls), and the total number of possible outcomes is 10 (since there are 10 balls in total). Therefore, the probability should be 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.\n\nNow, the second part is a bit trickier. It asks for the probability of drawing two balls without replacement, both of which I assume are red, since that's what the first part was about. If not, I might need to consider different combinations, but maybe I should clarify that.\n\nAssuming we're drawing two red balls without replacement, I need to find the probability of both events happening in sequence. Since it's without replacement, the probability changes after the first draw.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is still 5/10 or 1/2. Then, after drawing one red ball, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 9 balls remaining in the bag. So, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 4/9.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I multiply the probabilities: (5/10) * (4/9) = (1/2) * (4/9) = 4/18, which simplifies to 2/9 or approximately 22.22%.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe the question is asking for the probability of drawing two balls without replacement, and either both are red, both are blue, or both are green. If that's the case, I need to calculate the probabilities for each scenario and then sum them up.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Probability of both red: As calculated, (5/10)*(4/9) = 2/9.\n\n- Probability of both blue: There are 3 blue balls initially. So, first draw is 3/10, and second draw is 2/9. Therefore, (3/10)*(2/9) = 6/90 = 1/15.\n\n- Probability of both green: There are 2 green balls initially. First draw is 2/10, second draw is 1/9. So, (2/10)*(1/9) = 2/90 = 1/45.\n\nNow, to find the total probability of drawing two balls of the same color, I add up these probabilities: 2/9 + 1/15 + 1/45.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9, 15, and 45 is 45.\n\nSo, converting each fraction:\n\n- 2/9 = (2*5)/(9*5) = 10/45\n\n- 1/15 = (1*3)/(15*3) = 3/45\n\n- 1/45 remains 1/45\n\nNow, adding them up: 10/45 + 3/45 + 1/45 = 14/45.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two balls of the same color without replacement is 14/45, which is approximately 31.11%.\n\nBut wait, the question might not be asking for two balls of the same color. It might just be asking for the probability of drawing two red balls without replacement, as I initially thought. The wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLet me go back to the question: \"What is the probability of drawing a red ball? What if you draw two balls without replacement?\"\n\nSo, the first part is clearly about drawing one red ball, which is 5/10 or 1/2.\n\nThe second part says \"what if you draw two balls without replacement?\" It doesn't specify that both need to be red, but given the context, I think it's asking for the probability of both being red.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the probability of drawing two red balls in succession without replacement.\n\nIn that case, as I calculated earlier, it's (5/10)*(4/9) = 2/9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the probability of drawing at least one red ball when drawing two balls without replacement.\n\nThat would be different.\n\nTo find the probability of drawing at least one red ball, it might be easier to calculate the probability of not drawing any red balls (i.e., drawing two non-red balls) and subtract that from 1.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 5 non-red balls (3 blue + 2 green = 5 non-red).\n\nSo, probability of drawing two non-red balls without replacement is:\n\nFirst draw: 5 non-red / 10 total = 1/2\n\nSecond draw: 4 non-red / 9 total = 4/9\n\nTherefore, (1/2)*(4/9) = 4/18 = 2/9.\n\nSo, probability of at least one red ball is 1 - 2/9 = 7/9, which is approximately 77.78%.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? Is the second part asking for both balls to be red, or at least one to be red?\n\nLooking back at the question: \"What is the probability of drawing a red ball? What if you draw two balls without replacement?\"\n\nThe first part is clear: probability of drawing one red ball is 5/10 or 1/2.\n\nThe second part says \"what if you draw two balls without replacement?\" It doesn't specify anything about the color of the second ball, so perhaps it's asking for the probability of drawing a red ball in the first draw, and then another ball without replacement.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's asking for the probability of both balls being red.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the probability of drawing a red ball in the second draw without replacement.\n\nWait, but that's the same as drawing two red balls, since the first draw is red and the second draw is also red.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is that it's asking for the probability of both balls being red when drawing two balls without replacement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5/10)*(4/9) = 2/9.\n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the probability of drawing at least one red ball, it would be 7/9.\n\nBut based on the wording, I think it's more likely that it's asking for both balls to be red.\n\nSo, my final answer is 2/9 or approximately 22.22%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}} \\]"
