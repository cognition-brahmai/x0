        "content": "To determine the limit of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x^2 - 5x + 1}{x^2 + 4} \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the degrees of the numerator and the denominator:**\n   - The numerator is \\( 3x^2 - 5x + 1 \\), which is a polynomial of degree 2.\n   - The denominator is \\( x^2 + 4 \\), which is also a polynomial of degree 2.\n\n2. **Compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator:**\n   - Since both the numerator and the denominator have the same degree (degree 2), the limit as \\( x \\) approaches infinity is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n3. **Extract the leading coefficients:**\n   - The leading coefficient of the numerator is 3.\n   - The leading coefficient of the denominator is 1.\n\n4. **Calculate the limit:**\n   - When the degrees are equal, the limit is the ratio of the leading coefficients. Therefore, the limit is \\( \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\).\n\nAlternatively, to see this more clearly, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by \\( x^2 \\), the highest power of \\( x \\) in the denominator:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{3x^2 - 5x + 1}{x^2 + 4} = \\frac{3 - \\frac{5}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2}}{1 + \\frac{4}{x^2}} \\]\n\nNow, as \\( x \\) approaches infinity:\n\n- \\( \\frac{5}{x} \\) approaches 0.\n- \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) approaches 0.\n- \\( \\frac{4}{x^2} \\) approaches 0.\n\nSo, the function simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 - 0 + 0}{1 + 0} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
