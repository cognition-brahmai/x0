        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a bash script that takes a file path as input, counts the number of lines, words, and characters in that file, and then prints out these counts in a nice, formatted way. Sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n- **Lines**: This should be the number of newline characters in the file, plus one for the last line if it doesn't end with a newline.\n\n- **Words**: Typically, words are separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). So, I need to count sequences of non-whitespace characters.\n\n- **Characters**: This is simply the total number of characters in the file, including spaces and newlines.\n\nBash has some built-in commands that can help with this:\n\n- `wc` (word count) command can count lines, words, and characters.\n\n- `cat`, `grep`, and other text processing tools might also be useful, but `wc` seems perfect for this job.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Accept a file path as input from the user.\n\n2. Use `wc` to count lines, words, and characters.\n\n3. Format and print these counts in a user-friendly way.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the script.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a bash script that accepts a file path as input, counts the number of lines, words, and characters in the file, and prints the results in a formatted output, follow these steps:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The script will take a file path as an argument.\n2. **Counting**:\n   - Use the `wc` (word count) utility to count lines, words, and characters.\n3. **Output**:\n   - Format and print the counts in a readable manner.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided\nif [ \"$#\" -ne 1 ]; then\n    echo \"Usage: $0 <file_path>\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nfile_path=\"$1\"\n\n# Check if the file exists\nif [ ! -f \"$file_path\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: File not found.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Use wc to count lines, words, and characters\nread lines words characters < <(wc -l -w -c < \"$file_path\")\n\n# Print the results in a formatted way\necho \"Lines: $lines\"\necho \"Words: $words\"\necho \"Characters: $characters\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - The script checks if exactly one argument is provided. If not, it prints usage information and exits.\n   - It stores the provided file path in the `file_path` variable.\n\n2. **File Existence Check**:\n   - The script checks if the provided file path exists and is a regular file. If not, it prints an error message and exits.\n\n3. **Counting**:\n   - The `wc` command is used with options `-l` (lines), `-w` (words), and `-c` (characters).\n   - The counts are read into variables `lines`, `words`, and `characters` using process substitution.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The counts are printed in a formatted manner, making it easy for the user to understand the output.\n\nThis script provides a simple and efficient way to get line, word, and character counts for a given file, ensuring that the user receives clear and concise information."
