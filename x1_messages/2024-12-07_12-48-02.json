I was a tiny seed like you once.\n\nSapling: Yeah, Big Tree, I wanna be big and strong like you. But why you don't seem happy 'bout me gettin' big?\n\nOld Tree: It's not that, lil' tree. Gettin' big is nice, but it also means things change, and that's not always easy.\n\nSapling: Change? Isn't that fun? New leaves, bigger branches, more sun...\n\nOld Tree: Yeah, those are the good things 'bout gettin' big. But each new ring on your trunk means another year of seeing the world change. Sometimes, it's too much.\n\nSapling: Too much? But we trees gotta stand tall and strong, right?\n\nOld Tree: Yeah, we do. But being strong doesn't mean nothing can hurt us. We get storms, no rain, bugs... But, we keep going. That's what makes us strong.\n\nSapling: So, should I be scared of gettin' big?\n\nOld Tree: No, no! You gotta love it, lil' tree. Just know that life is a circle - one of gettin' big, changing, keep going, and starting over. It's all part of being a tree.\n\nSapling: I think I get it now, Big Tree. Thanks for telling me your smart stuff.\n\nOld Tree: You're welcome, lil' one. 'Member, every part of life has its own nice things and hard things. Love 'em all."

But why do you seem a bit sad about me growing up?\n\nOld Tree: It's not that, little one. Growing up is wonderful, but it also means change, and change can be challenging sometimes.\n\nSapling: Change? Isn't that exciting? New leaves, bigger branches, more sunlight...\n\nOld Tree: Absolutely, those are the great things about growing up. But each new ring on your trunk represents another year of witnessing the world around you change. Sometimes, that can be overwhelming.\n\nSapling: Overwhelming? But as trees, we're supposed to stand tall and strong, right?\n\nOld Tree: Yes, we are. But being strong doesn't mean we're invincible. We face storms, droughts, insects... but we persevere. That's what makes us resilient.\n\nSapling: So, should I be afraid of growing up?\n\nOld Tree: No, not at all! You should embrace it, little tree. Just understand that life is a cycle\u2014growth, change, perseverance, and renewal. It's all part of being a tree.\n\nSapling: I think I understand now, Big Tree. Thanks for sharing your wisdom with me.\n\nOld Tree: You're welcome, little one. Remember, every stage of life has its own joys and challenges. Embrace them all."
