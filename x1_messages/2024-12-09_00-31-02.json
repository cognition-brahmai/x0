        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in the room. Half of them have blue eyes, and the other half have green eyes. So, that means 50 people have blue eyes and 50 have green eyes.\n\nNow, if two-thirds of the blue-eyed people leave the room, we need to figure out how many blue-eyed people that is. Two-thirds of 50 is calculated as (2/3) * 50, which is about 33.333, but since we're dealing with people, we can't have a fraction of a person. So, maybe it's 33 or 34 people leaving. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that calculation.\n\nWait, actually, 2/3 of 50 is exactly 33.333..., but in reality, you can't have a third of a person leave the room. So, perhaps the problem assumes that exactly 33 or 34 blue-eyed people leave. But to be precise, let's consider that 33.333... is approximately 33 people leaving.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's think about it differently. If two-thirds of the blue-eyed people leave, that means one-third remain in the room. So, one-third of 50 is approximately 16.666..., which again isn't exact because we can't have a fraction of a person.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that exactly 33 blue-eyed people leave, leaving 17 behind. But I'm getting confused now.\n\nLet me try another approach. Total people: 100. Blue-eyed: 50, green-eyed: 50.\n\nTwo-thirds of blue-eyed leave, so number leaving is (2/3)*50 = 33.(3).\n\nBut since we can't have a fraction of a person, maybe the problem is hypothetical, and we can accept decimal answers.\n\nSo, if 33.333... blue-eyed people leave, then the number of blue-eyed people remaining is 50 - 33.333... = 16.666...\n\nBut the question is, how many people with green eyes remain? The green-eyed people haven't left; they're still in the room. So, the number of green-eyed people remains 50.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is trying to trick me. It says, \"how many people with green eyes remain?\" Which implies that perhaps some green-eyed people left as well, but according to the problem, only blue-eyed people left.\n\nSo, if only blue-eyed people left, and green-eyed people stayed, then the number of green-eyed people remaining is still 50.\n\nBut let's double-check: total people initially: 100.\n\nBlue-eyed: 50.\n\nGreen-eyed: 50.\n\nTwo-thirds of blue-eyed leave: (2/3)*50 = 33.(3).\n\nSo, blue-eyed people remaining: 50 - 33.(3) = 16.(6).\n\nTotal people remaining: green-eyed (50) + blue-eyed remaining (16.(6)) = 66.(6).\n\nBut the question is only asking about green-eyed people remaining, which is 50.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The green-eyed people didn't leave; they're all still there. So, regardless of how many blue-eyed people left, the green-eyed people remain 50.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
