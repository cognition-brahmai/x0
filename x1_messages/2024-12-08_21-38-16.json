        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a group of 25 people, where some can speak French, some can speak German, and some can speak both. I need to find out how many people can only speak one language.\n\nSo, here's what I know:\n\n- Total number of people: 25\n\n- Number who can speak French: 15\n\n- Number who can speak German: 10\n\n- Number who can speak both French and German: 6\n\nI need to find the number of people who can only speak one language, meaning they either only speak French or only speak German, but not both.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find out how many people can only speak French and how many can only speak German, and then add those two numbers together.\n\nLet's start with French:\n\n- Total French speakers: 15\n\n- Among them, 6 can also speak German\n\nSo, the number of people who can only speak French would be:\n\nOnly French = Total French - Both French and German = 15 - 6 = 9\n\nSimilarly, for German:\n\n- Total German speakers: 10\n\n- Among them, 6 can also speak French\n\nSo, the number of people who can only speak German would be:\n\nOnly German = Total German - Both French and German = 10 - 6 = 4\n\nNow, to find the total number of people who can only speak one language, I'll add only French and only German:\n\nOnly one language = Only French + Only German = 9 + 4 = 13\n\nWait a minute, but I have a total of 25 people in the group. Let's see if this makes sense.\n\nTotal people = Only French + Only German + Both + Neither\n\nI don't know how many people can't speak either language, though. The problem doesn't mention anything about people who can't speak French or German.\n\nHmm, does the problem say anything about whether everyone speaks at least one of the two languages?\n\nIt doesn't specify. So, perhaps there are people who can't speak either French or German.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Only French: 9\n\n- Only German: 4\n\n- Both French and German: 6\n\n- Neither: let's call this N\n\nNow, the sum of these should be the total number of people:\n\n9 (Only French) + 4 (Only German) + 6 (Both) + N (Neither) = 25\n\nSo,\n\n9 + 4 + 6 + N = 25\n\n19 + N = 25\n\nTherefore, N = 25 - 19 = 6\n\nSo, 6 people can't speak either French or German.\n\nBut the question is about how many can only speak one language, which is the sum of only French and only German, which is 9 + 4 = 13.\n\nWait, but I feel like there might be another way to look at this, maybe using set theory or Venn diagrams.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet F be the set of French speakers, and G be the set of German speakers.\n\nWe know:\n\n- |F| = 15\n\n- |G| = 10\n\n- |F \u2229 G| = 6\n\nWe can find the number of people who speak at least one language using the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|F \u222a G| = |F| + |G| - |F \u2229 G| = 15 + 10 - 6 = 19\n\nSo, 19 people speak at least one language (either French, German, or both).\n\nSince there are 25 people in total, the number who speak neither language is:\n\n25 - 19 = 6\n\nNow, the number of people who can only speak one language would be those who speak French but not German, plus those who speak German but not French.\n\nThat is:\n\nOnly French: |F| - |F \u2229 G| = 15 - 6 = 9\n\nOnly German: |G| - |F \u2229 G| = 10 - 6 = 4\n\nTherefore, only one language: 9 + 4 = 13\n\nSo, the answer should be 13.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIs there any possibility that some people speak more than two languages? The problem doesn't mention that, so I'll assume that the only languages considered are French and German.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"among those who can speak French, 6 also know how to speak German.\" So, that directly gives us the number of people who can speak both languages.\n\nEverything seems consistent with the calculations I've done.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of Venn diagrams.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents French speakers, and the other represents German speakers.\n\nThe overlapping area represents people who can speak both languages, which is 6 people.\n\nThe part of the French circle that doesn't overlap is the number of people who only speak French, which is 15 - 6 = 9.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the German circle that doesn't overlap is the number of people who only speak German, which is 10 - 6 = 4.\n\nThen, outside both circles, there are people who can't speak either language, which we've calculated as 6.\n\nSo, again, the number of people who can only speak one language is 9 + 4 = 13.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
