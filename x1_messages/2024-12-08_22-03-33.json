        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python program that reads a text file line by line and prints out only those lines that contain a specific keyword. The keyword will be provided when someone runs the program from the command line. Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I get all the parts right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to handle command-line arguments in Python. I know that Python has a module called `sys` that allows access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. One of these is `sys.argv`, which is a list containing the command-line arguments passed to the script. The first element, `sys.argv[0]`, is the script name, and the subsequent elements are the arguments.\n\nSo, if someone runs the script like this: `python myscript.py keyword`, then `sys.argv[1]` will be `'keyword'`.\n\nNext, I need to read a text file line by line. I should make sure to handle file operations properly, meaning I need to open the file, read it line by line, and then close it after I'm done. In Python, using the `with` statement is a good practice because it handles closing the file even if an error occurs during the file operations.\n\nSo, the basic structure will be:\n\n```python\nwith open(filename, 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        # process each line\n```\n\nI need to check each line to see if it contains the keyword. I should consider whether the keyword search should be case-sensitive or not. For simplicity, I'll make it case-sensitive first, but maybe I can add an option for case-insensitive search later.\n\nTo check if a line contains the keyword, I can use the `in` keyword:\n\n```python\nif keyword in line:\n    print(line)\n```\n\nBut if I want it to be case-insensitive, I can convert both the line and the keyword to lower case before checking:\n\n```python\nif keyword.lower() in line.lower():\n    print(line)\n```\n\nI should also think about how to handle the filename. Should it be another command-line argument, or should I hardcode it in the script? To make the script more versatile, it's better to have the filename also passed as a command-line argument.\n\nSo, the command would look like: `python myscript.py filename keyword`\n\nThen, in the script, `sys.argv[1]` would be `'filename'` and `sys.argv[2]` would be `'keyword'`.\n\nI need to make sure that the user provides both arguments; otherwise, the script should display an error message and exit.\n\nI can check the number of arguments using `len(sys.argv)`. If it's not equal to 3, then the user didn't provide both filename and keyword.\n\nI should also handle the case where the file doesn't exist or can't be opened for some reason. In Python, trying to open a non-existent file will raise a `FileNotFoundError`, so I should handle that exception.\n\nPutting it all together, here's a rough sketch of the script:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 3:\n    print(\"Usage: python myscript.py filename keyword\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nfilename = sys.argv[1]\nkeyword = sys.argv[2]\n\ntry:\n    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            if keyword in line:\n                print(line, end='')\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(f\"Error: The file {filename} was not found.\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n\nI'm using `print(line, end='')` to avoid adding an extra newline after each line, since `print` by default adds a newline.\n\nLet me test this logic. Suppose I have a file called `example.txt` with the following content:\n\n```\nThis is a sample text.\nContaining some lines.\nSome lines have the word sample.\nOthers do not.\n```\n\nIf I run `python myscript.py example.txt sample`, it should print:\n\n```\nThis is a sample text.\nSome lines have the word sample.\n```\n\nThat looks correct.\n\nNow, I might want to make the keyword search case-insensitive. To do that, I can modify the if condition to convert both the line and the keyword to lower case:\n\n```python\nif keyword.lower() in line.lower():\n    print(line, end='')\n```\n\nThat should handle case-insensitivity.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to strip leading and trailing whitespace from each line before checking, to make sure that there are no extra spaces affecting the match.\n\nI can use `line = line.strip()` inside the loop before checking for the keyword.\n\nWait, but if I strip the line, and the keyword is supposed to be in the original line with possible spaces, that might not be what the user expects. Maybe it's better to not strip unless necessary.\n\nI should consider what the user expects. If the keyword is 'sample', and the line is ' sample ', should it match? Depends on the use case.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll leave it as is, without stripping.\n\nAnother consideration is that the keyword might be part of another word. For example, if the keyword is 'sample', and the line contains 'sampling', it would still match. If I want to match whole words only, I need to adjust the logic.\n\nBut for now, I'll keep it simple and assume that partial matches are okay.\n\nI should also think about reading very large files. Since I'm reading line by line, it should handle large files efficiently without loading the entire file into memory.\n\nOne more thing: should I ignore empty lines? Probably not, unless specified.\n\nError handling: I've handled the `FileNotFoundError`, but there might be other I/O errors, like permission issues. I can catch the general `IOError` exception for that.\n\nWait, in Python 3, the exception is `FileNotFoundError`, which is a subclass of `OSError`. I can catch `OSError` to handle all file-related errors.\n\nHere's an improved version:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 3:\n    print(\"Usage: python myscript.py filename keyword\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nfilename = sys.argv[1]\nkeyword = sys.argv[2]\n\ntry:\n    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            if keyword in line:\n                print(line, end='')\nexcept OSError:\n    print(f\"Error: Could not open or read the file {filename}.\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n\nThis way, it handles not only missing files but also other I/O errors.\n\nLet me think about edge cases:\n\n1. The keyword is an empty string: every line contains an empty string, so all lines should be printed.\n\n2. The file is empty: no lines to print.\n\n3. The file has only one line.\n\n4. The file has multiple lines with the keyword in some of them.\n\n5. The keyword appears multiple times in a single line.\n\n6. The keyword is a multi-word phrase.\n\nWait, currently, the script only checks for single keywords, not phrases. If the user provides a phrase like 'sample text', it should look for that exact phrase in the line.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume single keywords for now. If I have time, I can think about extending it to phrases.\n\nFor phrases, I would need to check if the phrase is in the line, considering spaces and such.\n\nBut for now, single keywords suffice.\n\nAnother consideration: should I trim the keyword of whitespace? In case the user accidentally includes spaces around it.\n\nI can use `keyword = keyword.strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the keyword.\n\nThat's a good idea.\n\nUpdated script:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 3:\n    print(\"Usage: python myscript.py filename keyword\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nfilename = sys.argv[1]\nkeyword = sys.argv[2].strip()\n\ntry:\n    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            if keyword in line:\n                print(line, end='')\nexcept OSError:\n    print(f\"Error: Could not open or read the file {filename}.\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n\nI should test this script with various scenarios to ensure it works as expected.\n\nTest case 1:\n\n- filename: example.txt\n\n- keyword: 'sample'\n\n- Content:\n\n```\n\nThis is a sample text.\n\nContaining some lines.\n\nSome lines have the word sample.\n\nOthers do not.\n\n```\n\n- Expected output:\n\n```\n\nThis is a sample text.\n\nSome lines have the word sample.\n\n```\n\nTest case 2:\n\n- filename: example.txt\n\n- keyword: 'sample '\n\n- Content:\n\n```\n\nThis is a sample text.\n\nContaining some lines.\n\nSome lines have the word sample.\n\nOthers do not.\n\n```\n\n- Expected output: no lines, since 'sample ' (with a space) doesn't match.\n\nTest case 3:\n\n- filename: example.txt\n\n- keyword: 'sample'\n\n- Content:\n\n```\n\nThis is a Sampling text.\n\nContaining some lines.\n\nSome lines have the word Sample.\n\nOthers do not.\n\n```\n\n- Expected output (case-sensitive): no lines.\n\n- Expected output (case-insensitive): both lines with 'Sampling' and 'Sample'.\n\nSince I have both case-sensitive and case-insensitive versions in mind, maybe I should add an option for case-insensitivity.\n\nIn Python, I can add more advanced command-line argument parsing using the `argparse` module, which allows for more flexible and user-friendly command-line interfaces.\n\nFor example, I can have an optional argument `-i` or `--ignore-case` to make the search case-insensitive.\n\nHere's how I can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport argparse\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Print lines containing a specified keyword.')\nparser.add_argument('filename', help='The name of the file to read')\nparser.add_argument('keyword', help='The keyword to search for')\nparser.add_argument('-i', '--ignore-case', action='store_true', help='Ignore case when searching')\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\ntry:\n    with open(args.filename, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            if args.ignore_case:\n                if args.keyword.lower() in line.lower():\n                    print(line, end='')\n            else:\n                if args.keyword in line:\n                    print(line, end='')\nexcept OSError:\n    print(f\"Error: Could not open or read the file {args.filename}.\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n\nIn this version, I'm using `argparse` to define the command-line arguments. The `action='store_true'` for `--ignore-case` means that if the user specifies `-i` or `--ignore-case`, `args.ignore_case` will be `True`; otherwise, it's `False`.\n\nThis makes the script more flexible and user-friendly.\n\nI should update the usage message accordingly.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf I run `python myscript.py example.txt sample`, it will perform a case-sensitive search.\n\nIf I run `python myscript.py example.txt sample -i`, it will perform a case-insensitive search.\n\nThat's good.\n\nI should also think about how to handle keywords that contain special characters, but since I'm doing simple substring matching, special characters should not be an issue.\n\nAnother enhancement could be to allow matching whole words only, but that would complicate things a bit.\n\nFor now, I'll stick with substring matching.\n\nI should also consider that the keyword might contain spaces, meaning it's a phrase, but again, with substring matching, it should work as long as the phrase is present in the line.\n\nLet me test this enhanced version.\n\nTest case 4:\n\n- Command: `python myscript.py example.txt 'sample text'`\n\n- Content:\n\n```\n\nThis is a sample text.\n\nContaining some lines.\n\nSome lines have the word sample.\n\nOthers do not.\n\n```\n\n- Expected output:\n\n```\n\nThis is a sample text.\n\n```\n\nLooks good.\n\nAnother test:\n\n- Command: `python myscript.py example.txt 'sample' -i`\n\n- Content:\n\n```\n\nThis is a Sampling text.\n\nContaining some lines.\n\nSome lines have the word Sample.\n\nOthers do not.\n\n```\n\n- Expected output:\n\n```\n\nThis is a Sampling text.\n\nSome lines have the word Sample.\n\n```\n\nPerfect.\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements. I can make it even more advanced by allowing multiple keywords, or outputting the line numbers, but that might be overkill for this task.\n\nI should also consider what happens if the file is very large. Since I'm reading line by line, it should handle large files efficiently without consuming too much memory.\n\nOne more thing: should I remove any trailing newline characters when printing? Currently, `print(line, end='')` preserves the original newline in the file.\n\nBut in Python, `print` by default adds a newline, so if the line already has a newline, it will print correctly.\n\nWait, no. If `line` already contains a newline at the end, then `print(line, end='')` will print the line including its newline.\n\nIf the line doesn't have a newline, it might look strange, but in practice, text files usually have newline characters at the end of each line.\n\nI should be safe with `print(line, end='')`.\n\nAlright, I think this script is ready to be used.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python program that reads a text file line by line and prints out lines containing a specified keyword. The keyword is passed as a command-line argument. Optionally, the search can be made case-insensitive.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Command-Line Arguments**: Use the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments for flexibility.\n2. **File Handling**: Open the specified file using a context manager to ensure proper handling and closure of the file.\n3. **Keyword Search**: Check each line for the presence of the keyword. Optionally perform a case-insensitive search if specified.\n4. **Error Handling**: Handle exceptions for file opening and reading operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport argparse\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Set up argument parser\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Print lines containing a specified keyword.')\n    parser.add_argument('filename', help='The name of the file to read')\n    parser.add_argument('keyword', help='The keyword to search for')\n    parser.add_argument('-i', '--ignore-case', action='store_true', help='Ignore case when searching')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Perform the search\n    try:\n        with open(args.filename, 'r') as file:\n            for line in file:\n                if args.ignore_case:\n                    if args.keyword.lower() in line.lower():\n                        print(line, end='')\n                else:\n                    if args.keyword in line:\n                        print(line, end='')\n    except OSError:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not open or read the file {args.filename}.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Argument Parsing**:\n   - `argparse` is used to define and parse command-line arguments.\n   - `filename`: The name of the file to read.\n   - `keyword`: The keyword to search for in the file.\n   - `-i` or `--ignore-case`: Optional flag to perform a case-insensitive search.\n\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - The file is opened using a context manager (`with open(...)`) which ensures the file is properly closed after operations.\n   - Each line is read sequentially to check for the presence of the keyword.\n\n3. **Keyword Matching**:\n   - If the `--ignore-case` flag is provided, both the line and the keyword are converted to lowercase for comparison.\n   - If the keyword is found in the line, the line is printed without an additional newline.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Handles cases where the file cannot be opened or read, printing an error message to stderr and exiting with a non-zero status code.\n\nThis approach ensures the program is efficient, flexible, and user-friendly, handling various scenarios such as case sensitivity and non-existent files."
