We need to find the probability that all the other children are younger than her.\n\nHmm, well, the oldest child is a girl, which means the other three children are younger than her. So, all the other children are automatically younger than the oldest child, right?\n\nWait, is there something I'm missing here? The question seems straightforward. If the oldest child is a girl, then by definition, the other three children are younger than her.\n\nSo, does that mean the probability is 1, or 100%?\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the question is about the ages of the children beyond just their order.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps it's about their genders and ages together.\n\nWe know there are two boys and two girls. The oldest is a girl. So, the remaining three children are one girl and two boys.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that all other children are younger than the oldest girl.\n\nBut, again, by definition, the other children are younger since the oldest is, well, the oldest.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. It seems like the probability should be 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about birth order and ages, assuming that older children could have younger siblings.\n\nWait, but in a family, older children cannot be younger than younger children; that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I need to consider that the oldest child is designated, and the others are younger.\n\nSo, given that, the probability should be 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the arrangement of genders in terms of age.\n\nBut still, if the oldest is a girl, the others are younger, so all other children are indeed younger than the oldest.\n\nSo, the probability is 1.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
