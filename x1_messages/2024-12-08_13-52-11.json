You know, like when Elmer's playing his sax and I'm just sittin' back, relaxin', maybe with a carrot or two. It's all cool and mellow, not too many hares in the air. No need for no crazy operas or nothing; give me some nice, easy listening tunes that don't try too hard. And maybe a bit of country western now and then, nothing too twangy, just enough to make you tap your foot without getting all stompy. But honestly, as long as it ain't that opera stuff, I'm good. I mean, who needs all that when you can just enjoy a simple melody? So, yeah, smooth jazz and a touch of country\u2014that's my cup of tea, or in my case, my carrot stash."
