        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 people in a room, and each person knows a secret about the other nine. So, each person has knowledge of 9 secrets. But, since secrets are about other people, there might be some overlap in the secrets known by different people.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each person knows a secret about the other nine.\" Does that mean that each person has one unique secret about each of the other nine, or that there are nine secrets in total, each known by one person?\n\nHmm, it's a bit unclear. Let's assume that each person has one unique secret about each of the other nine people, meaning that there are 10 people, each with 9 unique secrets about the others.\n\nSo, total number of unique secrets in the room would be 10 people * 9 secrets each = 90 secrets. But wait, that counts each secret twice because if person A knows a secret about person B, then person B also knows a secret about person A, assuming the secrets are reciprocal.\n\nActually, maybe not necessarily reciprocal. Maybe the secrets are unique to each pair. For example, person A has a secret about person B, and person B has a different secret about person A.\n\nIn that case, the total number of unique secrets would be the number of ordered pairs of people, which is 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nBut if the secrets are about attributes that could be mutual, like \"person A and person B are friends,\" then the secrets might not be unique to the direction.\n\nGiven the problem's wording, \"each person knows a secret about the other nine,\" it seems like the secrets are directed: person A knows a secret about person B, which may not be known by person B about person A.\n\nSo, proceeding with the assumption that there are 10 * 9 = 90 unique secrets in total.\n\nNow, if one person leaves the room, there are 9 people remaining.\n\nWe need to find out how many secrets remain among those still in the room.\n\nFirst, let's consider the secrets that involve the person who left.\n\nAny secret that was known by the person who left about the remaining nine people is no longer in the room, since that person is gone.\n\nSimilarly, any secret that was known by the remaining nine people about the person who left is also no longer relevant, because the person who left is not there to have that secret about.\n\nSo, the secrets that remain are only those between the remaining nine people.\n\nEach of the remaining nine people knows secrets about the other eight.\n\nSo, for nine people, each knowing eight secrets, that would be 9 * 8 = 72 secrets.\n\nBut again, considering that secrets are directed, so person C knows a secret about person D, and person D knows a secret about person C, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the total number of secrets remaining is 72.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility of overlapping secrets? For example, if person C and person D both know a secret about person E, does that count as one secret or two?\n\nGiven that each person knows a secret about each other person, and assuming that these are unique secrets, then person C's secret about person E is different from person D's secret about person E.\n\nTherefore, each pair of people has two unique secrets: one known by each person about the other.\n\nHence, for nine people, the number of unique secrets is 9 * 8 = 72.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of combinations, the number of ordered pairs of people is 10 * 9 = 90 initially.\n\nWhen one person leaves, say person A, then the remaining ordered pairs are 9 * 8 = 72.\n\nTherefore, the number of secrets remaining is 72.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nInitially, there are 10 people, and each knows 9 secrets, totaling 10 * 9 = 90 secrets.\n\nWhen one person leaves, say person A, then:\n\n- All secrets that person A knew about the other nine are lost.\n\n- Additionally, all secrets that the other nine knew about person A are also lost.\n\nSo, the number of secrets lost is:\n\n- 9 secrets that person A knew about others.\n\n- Plus 9 secrets that others knew about person A.\n\n- But wait, does that double-count the secrets between person A and others?\n\nActually, no, because the secrets are directed: person A's secret about person B is different from person B's secret about person A.\n\nTherefore, total secrets lost are 9 (known by A) + 9 (known about A) = 18 secrets.\n\nTherefore, remaining secrets are 90 - 18 = 72.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each pair of people has two unique secrets (each knowing one about the other), the total number of secrets is 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nWhen one person leaves, say person A, then the remaining secrets are those among the remaining nine people.\n\nThe number of secrets among nine people is 9 * 8 = 72.\n\nAgain, this matches.\n\nTherefore, the number of secrets remaining among the nine people is 72.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we consider the secrets as being associated with pairs of people.\n\nIf each pair has two unique secrets (one in each direction), then the total number of secrets is indeed 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nWhen one person leaves, all secrets involving that person are removed, which is 10 * 9 / 10 * 2 = 18 secrets, leading to 90 - 18 = 72 remaining secrets.\n\nAlternatively, if secrets are only about others, not about oneself, then perhaps the calculation holds.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each person knows a secret about the other nine.\" So, indeed, no secret about oneself is involved.\n\nTherefore, the total number of secrets is 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nWhen one person leaves, 9 secrets they knew about others are lost, and 9 secrets that others knew about them are lost, totaling 18 secrets lost.\n\nThus, 90 - 18 = 72 secrets remain.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of graph theory, where each person is a node and each secret is a directed edge with a label.\n\nTotal directed edges (secrets) are 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nRemoving one node (person) removes all edges connected to that node, both incoming and outgoing.\n\nNumber of edges removed is 10 * 2 - 1 (since no self-loops), but wait, in a directed graph, removing a node removes all incoming and outgoing edges.\n\nSo, for a node with in-degree 9 and out-degree 9, removing it removes 9 incoming and 9 outgoing edges, total 18 edges.\n\nThus, 90 - 18 = 72 remaining edges (secrets).\n\nTherefore, the number of secrets remaining among the nine people is 72.\n\nBut perhaps there's another perspective.\n\nLet's consider that each person knows nine unique secrets about the others, and these secrets are distinct across the board.\n\nSo, with 10 people, that's 10 * 9 = 90 unique secrets.\n\nWhen one person leaves, we lose all secrets that person knew about others (9 secrets) and all secrets that others knew about that person (9 secrets), totaling 18 secrets.\n\nThus, 90 - 18 = 72 remaining secrets.\n\nAlternatively, among the remaining nine people, each still knows eight secrets about the others, so 9 * 8 = 72 secrets.\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of secrets remaining among the nine people is 72.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
