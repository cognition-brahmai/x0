        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a water tank. The tank can hold up to 1500 liters of water, and it takes 12 minutes to fill it up completely. I need to find out what the flow rate is in liters per minute. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what flow rate means. Flow rate is basically the amount of water that flows into the tank per unit of time. In this case, the unit of time is minutes, and the unit of volume is liters. So, liters per minute makes sense.\n\nNow, I have the total volume of the tank, which is 1500 liters, and the total time it takes to fill it, which is 12 minutes. To find the flow rate, I think I need to divide the total volume by the total time. That should give me the amount of water flowing into the tank each minute.\n\nSo, flow rate = total volume / total time\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFlow rate = 1500 liters / 12 minutes\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n1500 divided by 12.\n\nWell, 12 times 12 is 144, which is 1440 when multiplied by 10. So, 12 times 125 is 1500. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me check:\n\n12 times 125:\n\n12 times 100 is 1200, and 12 times 25 is 300, so 1200 + 300 is 1500.\n\nYes, so 12 times 125 equals 1500.\n\nTherefore, 1500 divided by 12 is 125.\n\nSo, the flow rate is 125 liters per minute.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf the flow rate is 125 liters per minute, and it flows for 12 minutes, then the total volume should be 125 times 12, which is 1500 liters. That matches the given total volume, so it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in smaller steps. Maybe break down the time or the volume.\n\nFor example, in 1 minute, if the flow rate is 125 liters, then in 12 minutes it would be 12 times 125, which is 1500 liters. That checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the time per liter, but that's not what the question is asking. It's asking for liters per minute, which is flow rate.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the flow rate is 125 liters per minute.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the flow rate, like pressure or the size of the inlet pipe, but based on the information given, I don't think that's necessary. The problem seems straightforward: given the total volume and the total time, the flow rate is simply the volume divided by the time.\n\nSo, final answer: 125 liters per minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
