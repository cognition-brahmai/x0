You have two kidneys, located on either side of your spine, just below the rib cage. They filter your blood multiple times a day, removing waste products and excess fluids, which are then excreted as urine. The kidneys also play a crucial role in regulating electrolytes, maintaining acid-base balance, and producing hormones that help control blood pressure and red blood cell production."
