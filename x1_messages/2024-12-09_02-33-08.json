        "content": "Let's see here. Tom is twice as old as his sister Sarah, and together their ages add up to the number of windows in their house, which is 36. So, I need to find out how old Sarah is.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to their ages. Let's say Sarah's age is S. Since Tom is twice as old as Sarah, Tom's age would be 2S.\n\nNow, their combined age is S + 2S, which equals 3S. And this combined age is equal to the number of windows, which is 36. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n3S = 36\n\nTo find S, I just need to divide both sides by 3:\n\nS = 36 / 3\n\nS = 12\n\nSo, Sarah is 12 years old.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If Sarah is 12, then Tom is twice that, so 24. Together, 12 + 24 equals 36, which matches the number of windows. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
