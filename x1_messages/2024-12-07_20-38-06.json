        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company produces widgets, and there's a 5% defect rate. They make 10,000 widgets in a day, and I need to find the probability that exactly 450 of them are defective. Hmm, probability can be tricky, but let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that each widget can be either defective or not defective, right? So, it's like a success/failure type of situation, where \"success\" is a defective widget. That sounds like a binomial distribution, where there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes, and a constant probability of success.\n\nIn binomial distribution, the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by the formula:\n\n\\[P(k) = C(n,k) \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(C(n,k)\\) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- \\(p\\) is the probability of success on any given trial.\n\n- \\(n\\) is the total number of trials.\n\n- \\(k\\) is the number of successes.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\(n = 10,000\\) (the number of widgets produced).\n\n- \\(k = 450\\) (the number of defective widgets we're interested in).\n\n- \\(p = 0.05\\) (the defect rate).\n\nSo, plugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\n\\[P(450) = C(10000,450) \\times (0.05)^{450} \\times (0.95)^{9550}\\]\n\nBut, wow, calculating \\(C(10000,450)\\) seems pretty daunting. I don't think I can compute that directly; it's way too big for my calculator. There has to be a better way.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that when n is large and p is not too close to 0 or 1, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu = n \\times p\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{n \\times p \\times (1-p)}\\).\n\nLet me check if that's applicable here. \\(n = 10,000\\), which is large, and \\(p = 0.05\\), which isn't too close to 0 or 1. So, yes, I think a normal approximation would work here.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean and standard deviation.\n\n\\[\\mu = n \\times p = 10000 \\times 0.05 = 500\\]\n\n\\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{n \\times p \\times (1-p)} = \\sqrt{10000 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.95} = \\sqrt{475} \\approx 21.79\\]\n\nSo, the normal distribution has \\(\\mu = 500\\) and \\(\\sigma \\approx 21.79\\).\n\nNow, to find the probability of exactly 450 defective widgets using the normal approximation, I need to use the continuity correction. Since the binomial distribution is discrete and the normal distribution is continuous, I need to adjust the range by 0.5.\n\nSo, for exactly 450, I'll use the interval from 449.5 to 450.5.\n\nTherefore, I need to find:\n\n\\[P(449.5 < X < 450.5)\\]\n\nWhere X is a normal random variable with \\(\\mu = 500\\) and \\(\\sigma \\approx 21.79\\).\n\nTo find this probability, I'll standardize X to the standard normal distribution Z, using the formula:\n\n\\[Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nFirst, let's find \\(Z\\) for 449.5:\n\n\\[Z_{lower} = \\frac{449.5 - 500}{21.79} \\approx \\frac{-50.5}{21.79} \\approx -2.32\\]\n\nAnd for 450.5:\n\n\\[Z_{upper} = \\frac{450.5 - 500}{21.79} \\approx \\frac{-49.5}{21.79} \\approx -2.27\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the area under the standard normal curve between \\(Z = -2.32\\) and \\(Z = -2.27\\).\n\nUsing a standard normal table or a calculator, I can find the cumulative probabilities for these Z-scores.\n\nFirst, find the cumulative probability for \\(Z = -2.27\\):\n\nLooking up \\(Z = 2.27\\) (since the table is usually for positive Z), the area is approximately 0.9884. Therefore, for \\(Z = -2.27\\), the cumulative probability is \\(1 - 0.9884 = 0.0116\\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\(Z = -2.32\\):\n\nLooking up \\(Z = 2.32\\), the area is approximately 0.9898. So, for \\(Z = -2.32\\), the cumulative probability is \\(1 - 0.9898 = 0.0102\\).\n\nNow, the probability between \\(Z = -2.32\\) and \\(Z = -2.27\\) is:\n\n\\[P(-2.32 < Z < -2.27) = P(Z < -2.27) - P(Z < -2.32) = 0.0116 - 0.0102 = 0.0014\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of having exactly 450 defective widgets is approximately 0.0014, or 0.14%.\n\nWait a second, that seems really small. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, mean and standard deviation seem correct: \\(\\mu = 500\\), \\(\\sigma \\approx 21.79\\).\n\nThe Z-scores also seem correct: \\(Z_{lower} \\approx -2.32\\) and \\(Z_{upper} \\approx -2.27\\).\n\nThe cumulative probabilities are also correctly found: \\(P(Z < -2.27) \\approx 0.0116\\) and \\(P(Z < -2.32) \\approx 0.0102\\).\n\nSubtracting them gives \\(0.0116 - 0.0102 = 0.0014\\), which is 0.14%.\n\nBut intuitively, with a mean of 500 and standard deviation of about 21.79, 450 is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. So, it should be a pretty low probability, but maybe not that low.\n\nLet me check if I should have used a different method. Maybe the Poisson approximation would be better here?\n\nThe Poisson approximation to the binomial is useful when n is large and p is small, which is the case here (n=10000, p=0.05). The Poisson distribution has parameter \\(\\lambda = n \\times p = 500\\).\n\nThe probability of exactly k successes in a Poisson distribution is:\n\n\\[P(k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\times e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\\]\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[P(450) = \\frac{500^{450} \\times e^{-500}}{450!}\\]\n\nThis looks even more complicated to calculate directly. Factorials and such large exponents are not practical without computational tools.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking with the normal approximation is the way to go, despite the low probability I obtained.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use software or a calculator that can handle these computations more accurately.\n\nAssuming I don't have access to such tools, the normal approximation with continuity correction seems reasonable, and the calculated probability of approximately 0.0014, or 0.14%, stands.\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 450 widgets are defective is about 0.14%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.0014} \\]"
