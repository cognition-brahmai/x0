        "content": "Sure! Here's a Python function that implements the quicksort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of numbers to it, and it will return the sorted list. For example:\n\n```python\nunsorted_list = [3,6,8,10,1,2,1]\nsorted_list = quicksort(unsorted_list)\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\nThe quicksort algorithm works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This implementation uses list comprehensions to create the left, middle, and right lists based on the pivot.\n"
