        "content": "So I have this problem here about students playing soccer and basketball. Let's see what it's asking. There are 25 students in total. Out of these, 12 play soccer, 8 play basketball, and 5 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that some students play both sports, which is 5 students. So, if 12 play soccer and 5 of those also play basketball, that means the number of students who play only soccer is 12 minus 5, which is 7. Similarly, for basketball, 8 play basketball, and 5 of those also play soccer, so the number who play only basketball is 8 minus 5, which is 3.\n\nNow, if I add up those who play only soccer, only basketball, and both, that should give me the total number of students who play at least one sport. So, that's 7 (only soccer) plus 3 (only basketball) plus 5 (both), which totals 15 students.\n\nSince there are 25 students in total, the number who don't play either sport would be 25 minus 15, which is 10.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. 12 play soccer, 8 play basketball, and 5 play both. So, only soccer is 12 - 5 = 7, only basketball is 8 - 5 = 3, and both is 5. Total playing at least one sport is 7 + 3 + 5 = 15. Total students are 25, so 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a formula for this kind of problem: the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula is:\n\nTotal = A + B - Both + Neither\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the number in group A (soccer),\n\n- B is the number in group B (basketball),\n\n- Both is the number in both groups,\n\n- Neither is the number in neither group.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\n25 = 12 + 8 - 5 + Neither\n\nLet's solve for Neither:\n\n25 = 20 - 5 + Neither\n\n25 = 15 + Neither\n\nNeither = 25 - 15\n\nNeither = 10\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 10 students do not play either sport.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this. Suppose I consider the students who play soccer and those who play basketball, and account for the overlap.\n\nThe total number who play at least one sport is A + B - Both, which is 12 + 8 - 5 = 15, as before. Then, total students minus those who play at least one sport gives those who play neither, which is 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of sets. Let S be the set of students playing soccer, and B be the set of students playing basketball. The number of students playing at least one sport is |S \u222a B|, which is |S| + |B| - |S \u2229 B|. So, |S \u222a B| = 12 + 8 - 5 = 15. Then, the number not playing any sport is the total students minus this number, which is 25 - 15 = 10.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, the answer comes out to be 10 students.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance I'm miscounting. For example, are there students who might be playing other sports not mentioned here? The question only talks about soccer and basketball, so students who don't play these two sports are considered as not playing any sport, assuming there are no other sports involved.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the numbers given make sense. There are 12 who play soccer and 8 who play basketball, with 5 playing both. So, the number of students playing soccer only is 7, basketball only is 3, both is 5, and neither is 10, totaling 25 students.\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. I think my answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
