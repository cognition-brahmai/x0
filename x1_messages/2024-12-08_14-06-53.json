I can, however, provide you with a general idea of how this information might be structured in JSON format.\n\nHere's an example of how the information could be presented:\n\n```\n\n{\n\n\"buildings\": [\n\n{\n\n\"name\": \"Building A\",\n\n\"height\": \"X meters\",\n\n\"location\": \"City, Country\",\n\n\"year_completed\": \"YYYY\"\n\n},\n\n{\n\n\"name\": \"Building B\",\n\n\"height\": \"Y meters\",\n\n\"location\": \"City, Country\",\n\n\"year_completed\": \"YYYY\"\n\n},\n\n{\n\n\"name\": \"Building C\",\n\n\"height\": \"Z meters\",\n\n\"location\": \"City, Country\",\n\n\"year_completed\": \"YYYY\"\n\n}\n\n]\n\n}\n\n```\n\nTo get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking reliable sources such as official architecture websites, encyclopedias, or databases that specialize in building statistics.\n\n\n"
