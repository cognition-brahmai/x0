        "content": "So the farmer has 15 cows and 5 chickens, making a total of 20 animals. The problem says that \"all but 8\" of these animals die. So, \"all but 8\" means that 8 animals do not die. Therefore, the number of animals still alive is 8.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The phrase \"all but 8\" means that every animal except for 8 dies. So, if there are 20 animals in total and \"all but 8\" die, then 20 minus 8 equals 12 animals die, leaving 8 alive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overthinking it. The straightforward interpretation is that 8 animals survive. But let's see if there's any trick here.\n\nPerhaps the trick is in the types of animals that survive. Maybe only cows or only chickens survive, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says that all but 8 die, without specifying which ones survive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"all but 8\" refers to a specific group. For example, all cows but 8 die, or something like that. But the problem says \"all but 8 of these animals die,\" referring to all the animals collectively, not just one type.\n\nSo, sticking to the straightforward interpretation, if there are 20 animals in total and all but 8 die, then 8 animals are still alive.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider another angle. Maybe some cows and some chickens survive. For example, perhaps 5 cows and 3 chickens survive, totaling 8 animals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all 5 chickens die, and only 8 cows survive. But the problem says \"all but 8 die,\" meaning that 8 animals in total survive, not necessarily 8 cows or 8 chickens.\n\nWait, or maybe it's a trick with the way the animals are counted. But no, the problem is pretty clear: 15 cows, 5 chickens, total 20 animals, all but 8 die, so 8 survive.\n\nI think the answer is simply 8 animals are still alive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
