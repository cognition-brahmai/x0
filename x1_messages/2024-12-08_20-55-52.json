        "content": "\"In the Air Tonight\" is a song by Phil Collins, released in 1981 as part of his album \"Face Value.\" The song has been a subject of much speculation and interpretation due to its enigmatic lyrics and intense drumming, which has led to various theories about its meaning.\n\nOne of the most persistent rumors is that the song is about Collins witnessing a drowning and confronting the person who allowed it to happen. This theory suggests that the lyrics refer to a specific event where someone drowned, and Collins was present but unable to prevent it, leading to feelings of guilt and anger towards the person who could have intervened but didn't.\n\nHowever, Collins has repeatedly denied this interpretation. In various interviews, he has stated that the song is not about any specific event or person. Instead, he has described it as a reflection on his own anger and the need to confront and control it.\n\nIn a 1981 interview with Rolling Stone, Collins explained that the song was inspired by his frustration with the music industry and the pressures he faced as a musician. He said, \"I was feeling really angry about things, and I needed to write something that would let me vent that anger.\"\n\nCollins has also mentioned that the song was influenced by his experience with tinnitus, a ringing in the ears that can be caused by loud noises, including drumming. He has said that the song's build-up and release mirror the physical and emotional sensations he experiences with tinnitus.\n\nFurthermore, the line \"It's hard to see, what's real and what's make believe\" has been interpreted as Collins grappling with the artificiality of the music business and the difficulty of distinguishing between genuine emotions and manufactured personas.\n\nIn summary, while the \"drowning\" theory persists, Phil Collins has clearly stated that \"In the Air Tonight\" is not about a specific event but rather about his own feelings of anger and the need to confront them. The song is a personal expression of emotion and a reflection on the pressures and frustrations he faced in his career."
