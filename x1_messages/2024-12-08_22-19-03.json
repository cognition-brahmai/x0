        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 250 widgets per hour, and each widget requires 2 minutes of machine time. They operate 8 hours per day. I need to find out how many machines are needed.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total machine time required per hour. Since each widget takes 2 minutes on a machine, and they produce 250 widgets per hour, the total machine time needed per hour is 250 widgets * 2 minutes/widget = 500 minutes.\n\nBut wait, there are only 60 minutes in an hour, so 500 minutes per hour doesn't make sense unless there are multiple machines working simultaneously.\n\nSo, if one machine can work for 60 minutes in an hour, and the total machine time needed is 500 minutes per hour, then the number of machines required would be 500 minutes / 60 minutes per machine = 8.333 machines.\n\nBut you can't have a fraction of a machine, so you'd need to round up to 9 machines.\n\nLet me double-check that. If there are 9 machines, each working for 60 minutes per hour, that's 9 * 60 = 540 minutes per hour. Since the requirement is 500 minutes, 540 minutes cover that.\n\nIf there were only 8 machines, that would be 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per hour, which is less than the required 500 minutes. So, 8 machines wouldn't be enough because 480 minutes is less than 500 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs 9 machines to meet the production target of 250 widgets per hour.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's consider the factory operates 8 hours per day. But actually, since the production rate is per hour, and the machine time is per widget, the daily operating hours might not directly affect the number of machines needed, as long as they operate for those 8 hours.\n\nSo, the number of machines required remains based on the hourly production rate.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's calculate the total daily production.\n\n250 widgets per hour * 8 hours per day = 2,000 widgets per day.\n\nEach widget requires 2 minutes of machine time, so total machine time needed per day is 2,000 widgets * 2 minutes/widget = 4,000 minutes per day.\n\nIf each machine works for 8 hours per day, that's 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes per machine per day.\n\nSo, the number of machines needed would be total machine time required per day divided by machine time available per machine per day: 4,000 minutes / 480 minutes per machine \u2248 8.333 machines.\n\nAgain, rounding up to 9 machines.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of machine utilization. If each machine is running continuously for 8 hours, it can produce a certain number of widgets.\n\nEach machine can produce 60 minutes per hour / 2 minutes per widget = 30 widgets per hour.\n\nOver 8 hours, one machine can produce 30 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 240 widgets per day.\n\nIf the factory needs to produce 2,000 widgets per day, then the number of machines required would be 2,000 widgets / 240 widgets per machine \u2248 8.333 machines, which again suggests needing 9 machines.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated based on hourly production, and got the same result.\n\nSo, all methods point to needing 9 machines.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. For example, are there breaks or downtime for the machines? The problem doesn't specify any downtime, so I'll assume the machines can operate continuously for the 8 hours.\n\nAlso, I've assumed that all machines are identical and operate at the same rate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the widgets can be produced in parallel or if there's any sequencing required. But since each widget requires 2 minutes on a machine, and machines can work simultaneously, parallel production is possible.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the factory needs 9 machines to produce 250 widgets per hour, given each widget requires 2 minutes of machine time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
