        "content": "So there are 20 students in the class, and each student has exactly 4 friends in the class. We need to find out how many friendships exist among them. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a friendship means here. If student A is friends with student B, then student B is also friends with student A. So, each friendship is a mutual connection between two students.\n\nNow, if every student has 4 friends, that means each student is connected to 4 other students. So, if I think about it in terms of connections, each student has 4 connections.\n\nBut, since each friendship involves two students, if I just multiply the number of students by the number of friends each has, I'll be counting each friendship twice. Let me explain that.\n\nSuppose there are only 2 students, and they are friends with each other. Then, each has 1 friend, so total friends are 2, but there's only 1 friendship. So, in this case, number of friendships is half the total number of friends.\n\nSimilarly, in this problem, with 20 students each having 4 friends, the total number of friends is 20 times 4, which is 80. But since each friendship is counted twice in this total, the actual number of friendships should be half of that.\n\nSo, number of friendships = 80 / 2 = 40.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the concept of handshakes. If every person shakes hands with every other person, the total number of handshakes is n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of people. But in this case, it's not every student being friends with every other student; each student has only 4 friends.\n\nSo, the handshake analogy isn't directly applicable here. Instead, this seems more like a graph theory problem, where students are nodes and friendships are edges.\n\nIn graph theory, the degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. Here, each student has a degree of 4, meaning each node has 4 edges.\n\nThe sum of the degrees of all nodes in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges, because each edge contributes to the degree of two nodes.\n\nSo, sum of degrees = 2 * number of edges.\n\nIn this case, sum of degrees = 20 * 4 = 80.\n\nTherefore, number of edges (friendships) = 80 / 2 = 40.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this to confirm?\n\nLet's try to think about it combinatorially.\n\nWe have 20 students, and we need to choose pairs of them to represent friendships.\n\nBut since each student has exactly 4 friends, we need to ensure that each student appears in exactly 4 friendships.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky directly, so maybe sticking with the graph theory approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we try to count the total number of friendships directly.\n\nEach friendship involves two students, so if we list all possible pairs, there are C(20,2) = 190 possible friendships.\n\nBut not all of these are actual friendships; only those where the two students are friends.\n\nGiven that each student has 4 friends, we can think of each student having 4 friendships.\n\nSo, total friendships would be (20 * 4) / 2 = 40.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, think about it this way: if we list all the friendships from each student's perspective, we'd have 20 students each listing 4 friendships, totaling 80.\n\nBut since each friendship is listed twice (once from each friend's perspective), the actual number of unique friendships is 80 / 2 = 40.\n\nI think this makes sense.\n\nIs there any chance that some friendships are being counted more than twice or something like that?\n\nWell, no, because friendships are mutual and undirected, so each friendship should be counted exactly twice in the total count of friends.\n\nAlright, so the answer should be 40 friendships.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider a smaller example.\n\nSuppose there are 4 students, each with 2 friends.\n\nIf we apply the same logic: total friends = 4 * 2 = 8, and number of friendships = 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nYes, because in this case, the students could be arranged in a cycle, where each is friends with two others, forming a loop. That would indeed have 4 friendships.\n\nSimilarly, with 20 students each having 4 friends, the structure would be more complex, but the calculation should hold.\n\nTherefore, the number of friendships is 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
