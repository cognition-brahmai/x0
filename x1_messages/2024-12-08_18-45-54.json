        "content": "This is a classic logic puzzle, and it's a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out. So, there are two doors: one leads to death, and the other leads to riches. There are two people: one always tells the truth, and the other always lies. I don't know which is which, and I can only ask one question to one of them.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what kind of question would give me information about both the doors and the people. It seems complicated because I have to consider whether the person I'm asking is a truth-teller or a liar.\n\nLet me consider asking directly about the doors. For example, \"Which door leads to the riches?\" But the problem is, if I ask the liar, they might point me to the death door, and if I ask the truth-teller, they'll point to the riches door. But since I don't know who is who, I can't be sure.\n\nMaybe I need to ask a question that involves both people and doors in a way that their answers will help me distinguish between the two.\n\nLet's think about asking about what the other person would say. For example, \"If I were to ask the other person which door leads to the riches, what would they say?\"\n\nOkay, let's consider this:\n\n- If I ask the truth-teller about the liar, the truth-teller knows that the liar would point to the wrong door, so the truth-teller would tell me that the liar would point to the death door.\n\n- If I ask the liar about the truth-teller, the liar would know that the truth-teller would point to the riches door, but since the liar lies, they would tell me that the truth-teller would point to the death door.\n\nWait a minute, in both cases, if I ask \"What door would the other person say leads to the riches?\", both the truth-teller and the liar would point to the death door.\n\nBut that means, regardless of who I ask, I get pointed to the death door. So, in that case, I should choose the opposite door to reach the riches.\n\nIs that right? Let's test it:\n\n1. Suppose I ask the truth-teller: \"What door would the liar say leads to the riches?\" The truth-teller knows the liar would point to the death door, so the truth-teller tells me that the liar would point to the death door. So, I choose the opposite, which is the riches door.\n\n2. Suppose I ask the liar: \"What door would the truth-teller say leads to the riches?\" The liar knows the truth-teller would point to the riches door, but since the liar lies, they tell me that the truth-teller would point to the death door. Again, I choose the opposite, which is the riches door.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, I get pointed to the death door and choose the opposite, which is the riches door.\n\nThat seems to work. But is there a better way to phrase the question?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can ask, \"Which door would you recommend I choose?\" \n\n- The truth-teller would recommend the riches door.\n\n- The liar would recommend the death door.\n\nBut since I don't know who is who, I can't be sure which door is which based on their recommendation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to ask, \"If I were to ask you which door leads to the riches, would you point to this door?\" while pointing to one of the doors.\n\nHmm, that might be too confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose I ask, \"Which door would you choose if you were me?\"\n\n- The truth-teller would choose the riches door.\n\n- The liar would choose the death door.\n\nAgain, without knowing who is who, I'm back to square one.\n\nWait, perhaps I should ask, \"Which door does the other person think leads to the riches?\"\n\n- If I ask the truth-teller, they would truthfully say which door the liar thinks leads to the riches, which is the death door.\n\n- If I ask the liar, they would lie about which door the truth-teller thinks leads to the riches, so they would say the death door.\n\nAgain, same as before. Both point to the death door, so I choose the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can ask, \"If I were to ask you which door leads to death, which door would you point to?\"\n\n- The truth-teller would point to the death door.\n\n- The liar would point to the riches door, because they lie.\n\nBut again, I don't know who is who.\n\nWait, perhaps I can ask, \"Which door does the other person think leads to death?\"\n\n- The truth-teller would know that the liar would point to the riches door as leading to death, so the truth-teller would say the riches door.\n\n- The liar would know that the truth-teller would point to the death door, but since the liar lies, they would say the riches door.\n\nSo, in this case, both would point to the riches door.\n\nThen, I should choose the opposite, which is the death door, but that's not what I want.\n\nI need to find a way to consistently get either the correct door or a pointer to the incorrect door, so I can choose the opposite.\n\nWait, maybe I should ask, \"Which door would both of you agree on?\"\n\n- The truth-teller would only agree on the door that actually leads to riches, but the liar would agree on the death door.\n\nWait, no, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can ask, \"Is the door you're standing in front of the one leading to riches?\"\n\n- The truth-teller, if in front of the riches door, would say yes.\n\n- The truth-teller, if in front of the death door, would say no.\n\n- The liar, if in front of the riches door, would say no.\n\n- The liar, if in front of the death door, would say yes.\n\nThis is tricky because their answers are conflicting, and I don't know who is who.\n\nWait, perhaps I can combine questions.\n\nBut I can only ask one question to one person.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should ask a question about what they think about the other person.\n\nFor example, \"If I were to ask the other person which door leads to the riches, would they point to this door?\" while pointing to one of the doors.\n\nLet's say I point to door A.\n\n- If I ask the truth-teller about the liar, the truth-teller knows the liar would point to the death door. So, if door A is the death door, the truth-teller would say \"yes.\"\n\n- If door A is the riches door, the truth-teller would say \"no.\"\n\n- If I ask the liar about the truth-teller, the liar knows the truth-teller would point to the riches door. So, if door A is the riches door, the liar would lie and say \"no.\"\n\n- If door A is the death door, the liar would lie and say \"yes.\"\n\nWait, so in both cases, if door A is the death door, both would say \"yes,\" and if door A is the riches door, both would say \"no.\"\n\nTherefore, if they say \"yes,\" door A is the death door, and I should choose the other door.\n\nIf they say \"no,\" door A is the riches door, and I should choose door A.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet's test it:\n\nScenario 1:\n\n- Door A: riches\n\n- Truth-teller in front of door A\n\n- I ask, \"If I were to ask the other person which door leads to the riches, would they point to door A?\"\n\n- The truth-teller knows the liar would point to door B (death), so they would say \"no.\"\n\n- If I get \"no,\" I choose door A, which is correct.\n\nScenario 2:\n\n- Door A: death\n\n- Liar in front of door A\n\n- I ask, \"If I were to ask the other person which door leads to the riches, would they point to door A?\"\n\n- The liar knows the truth-teller would point to door B (riches), so they lie and say \"yes.\"\n\n- If I get \"yes,\" I choose the other door, door B, which is correct.\n\nScenario 3:\n\n- Door A: riches\n\n- Liar in front of door A\n\n- I ask, \"If I were to ask the other person which door leads to the riches, would they point to door A?\"\n\n- The liar knows the truth-teller would point to door A, so they lie and say \"no.\"\n\n- If I get \"no,\" I choose door A, which is correct.\n\nScenario 4:\n\n- Door A: death\n\n- Truth-teller in front of door A\n\n- I ask, \"If I were to ask the other person which door leads to the riches, would they point to door A?\"\n\n- The truth-teller knows the liar would point to door A (death), so they say \"yes.\"\n\n- If I get \"yes,\" I choose the other door, door B, which is correct.\n\nSo, in all scenarios, if I get \"yes,\" I choose the other door, and if I get \"no,\" I choose door A.\n\nThis seems consistent and reliable.\n\nTherefore, the question I should ask is:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other person which door leads to the riches, would they point to this door?\" while pointing to one of the doors.\n\nThen, if the answer is \"yes,\" I choose the other door, and if \"no,\" I choose that door.\n\nThis way, I can successfully identify the door leading to the riches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Ask, \"If I were to ask the other person which door leads to the riches, would they point to this door?\" while pointing to one of the doors. If the answer is \"yes,\" choose the other door; if \"no,\" choose that door.}} \\]"
