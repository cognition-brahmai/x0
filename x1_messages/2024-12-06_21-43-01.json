        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden that's 25 feet long and 15 feet wide, and I need to figure out how much fencing is required to go around it. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that a rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So, there are two sides that are 25 feet each and two sides that are 15 feet each. To find the total amount of fencing needed, I think I need to add up all the sides.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal fencing = length + length + width + width\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nTotal fencing = 25 + 25 + 15 + 15\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n25 plus 25 is 50, and 15 plus 15 is 30. So, 50 plus 30 equals 80 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there a shorter way to calculate this? I recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is sometimes calculated using a formula. Maybe I can use that.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:\n\nP = 2 * (length + width)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP = 2 * (25 + 15) = 2 * 40 = 80 feet\n\nOkay, that matches what I calculated earlier by adding all the sides separately. So, that gives me more confidence that 80 feet is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I can visualize this. If I imagine the garden, it's longer in one direction, 25 feet, and shorter in the other, 15 feet. So, going around it, I'd have to cover both the longer sides and both the shorter sides.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider it as a path around the garden. If I start at one corner and walk along the length to the next corner, that's 25 feet. Then, turn and walk along the width, that's 15 feet. Then again along the length, 25 feet, and finally along the width, 15 feet, back to where I started.\n\nSo, adding those up: 25 + 15 + 25 + 15, which again is 80 feet.\n\nAlternatively, since there are two of each length and width, I could multiply each by 2 and add them together, which is basically what the perimeter formula does.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. It seems like 80 feet is the amount of fencing needed.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there anything else I need to consider, like maybe the gates or something? But the problem doesn't mention any gates or additional features, so probably not.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent, which they are, since both length and width are given in feet.\n\nSo, I think 80 feet is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
