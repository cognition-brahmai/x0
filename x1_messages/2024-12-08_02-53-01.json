        "content": "So I've got this problem about a rectangular garden. It says that the length is 5 meters longer than the width, and the area is 84 square meters. I need to find the dimensions, which means finding both the length and the width. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, area = length \u00d7 width. That makes sense. Now, the problem gives me that the area is 84 square meters. So, I can write that as:\n\nlength \u00d7 width = 84\n\nBut I have two variables here, so I need another equation to relate them. The problem also says that the length is 5 meters longer than the width. So, if I let the width be, say, w meters, then the length would be w + 5 meters. That seems straightforward.\n\nSo, now I can substitute these expressions into the area equation:\n\n(w + 5) \u00d7 w = 84\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation with one variable, w, which is the width. I can expand this equation:\n\nw\u00b2 + 5w = 84\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. I need to solve for w. To do that, I should set the equation to zero. So, I'll subtract 84 from both sides:\n\nw\u00b2 + 5w - 84 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in standard form: w\u00b2 + 5w - 84 = 0. I can solve this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -84 and add up to 5. Let's see, some pairs of factors of 84 are: 1 and 84, 2 and 42, 3 and 28, 4 and 21, 6 and 14, 7 and 12. Since I need them to multiply to -84, one of them has to be negative.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -84 and add to 5, I think 12 and -7 would work because 12 \u00d7 -7 = -84 and 12 + (-7) = 5.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(w + 12)(w - 7) = 0\n\nNow, setting each factor equal to zero gives me the possible solutions for w:\n\nw + 12 = 0 \u21d2 w = -12\n\nw - 7 = 0 \u21d2 w = 7\n\nBut, width can't be negative, so w = -12 doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, the width must be 7 meters.\n\nNow, since the length is 5 meters longer than the width, length = w + 5 = 7 + 5 = 12 meters.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 7 meters in width and 12 meters in length.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If width is 7 and length is 12, then the area is 7 \u00d7 12 = 84, which matches the given area. Also, the length is indeed 5 meters longer than the width. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the quadratic formula to solve for w. The quadratic formula is:\n\nw = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nFor the equation w\u00b2 + 5w - 84 = 0, a = 1, b = 5, and c = -84. Plugging these values in:\n\nw = [-5 \u00b1 \u221a(5\u00b2 - 4(1)(-84))] / (2(1))\n\nw = [-5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 + 336)] / 2\n\nw = [-5 \u00b1 \u221a361] / 2\n\nw = [-5 \u00b1 19] / 2\n\nNow, calculating both possibilities:\n\nw = (-5 + 19) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7\n\nw = (-5 - 19) / 2 = -24 / 2 = -12\n\nAgain, w = -12 is not feasible, so w = 7 meters, and length = 7 + 5 = 12 meters.\n\nI could also check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using geometry or some other method, but I think the algebraic approach is sufficient here.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes, problems like these can have tricky parts, but in this case, it seems straightforward. Just need to translate the words into equations and solve.\n\nSo, to summarize, the garden has a width of 7 meters and a length of 12 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{width} = 7 \\text{ meters}, \\text{ length} = 12 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
