        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 houses on a street, each painted with a different color. The colors mentioned are green, white, red, and blue. So, there must be one more color, but it's not specified. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the blue house is the first house on the left. Okay, so position 1 is blue.\n\nNext, the red house is in the middle. Since there are 5 houses, the middle one would be position 3. So, position 3 is red.\n\nNow, the green house is immediately to the left of the white house. That means green and white are next to each other, with green on the left and white on the right.\n\nSo, we have positions 1 to 5:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: ?\n\n3: Red\n\n4: ?\n\n5: ?\n\nWe need to place green and white in positions such that green is immediately to the left of white.\n\nPossible pairs for green and white could be:\n\n- Positions 1 and 2, but position 1 is already blue, so not possible.\n\n- Positions 2 and 3, but position 3 is red, so not possible.\n\n- Positions 3 and 4, but position 3 is red, so not possible.\n\n- Positions 4 and 5.\n\nSo, the only possible positions for green and white are positions 4 and 5, with green in 4 and white in 5.\n\nTherefore, the last house on the right is the white house.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm.\n\nWe have:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: ?\n\n3: Red\n\n4: Green\n\n5: White\n\nNow, are there any other constraints? The problem mentions that there are five houses, each with a different color, and only green, white, red, and blue are mentioned. So, there must be one more color for house 2.\n\nBut since the question is only asking for the last house on the right, and we've deduced it's white, that should be the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{white}} \\]"
