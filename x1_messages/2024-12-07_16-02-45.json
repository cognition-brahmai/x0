        "content": "I'm here to help with your questions, but I need to clarify some information first. It seems there might be some confusion in the details you've provided about Martin Luther King Jr. Let's address this step by step.\n\nFirstly, Martin Luther King Jr. was not a leader in the Women's Suffrage Movement. He was a prominent leader in the African American Civil Rights Movement. The Women's Suffrage Movement was focused on securing voting rights for women, while King was advocating for racial equality and civil rights for African Americans.\n\nSecondly, Martin Luther King Jr. was not born in 1949. He was actually born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, not Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nRegarding the Equal Rights Amendment, it is true that Martin Luther King Jr. supported it, but he was not directly involved in its establishment. The amendment was first introduced in Congress in 1923 and was passed in 1972, but it never received ratification from the required number of states to be enacted into law.\n\nLastly, Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, not in 1980, for his nonviolent resistance to racial prejudice in America.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, I suspect there might be some confusion between Martin Luther King Jr. and other historical figures. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\n\nAs for your request for citations, the information about Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth date and place, as well as his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement and his receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, can be verified through numerous reliable sources, including the official Nobel Prize website and the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change.\n\nHere are a couple of references:\n\n1. \"Martin Luther King Jr.\" NobelPrize.org. Nobel Media AB 2020.

If you have any more questions, please let me know."
