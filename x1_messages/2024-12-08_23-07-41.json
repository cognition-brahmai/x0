        "content": "Let's see. I have this sequence where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2 and then subtracting 3. It starts with 4. I need to find the 5th term.\n\nOkay, so the first term is 4.\n\nTo get the second term, I multiply 4 by 2, which is 8, and then subtract 3, which gives me 5.\n\nSo, term 2 is 5.\n\nNow, for the third term, I take 5, multiply by 2 to get 10, and subtract 3 to get 7.\n\nTerm 3 is 7.\n\nNext, term 4: 7 multiplied by 2 is 14, minus 3 is 11.\n\nSo, term 4 is 11.\n\nFinally, term 5: 11 times 2 is 22, minus 3 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the 5th term is 19.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nStart with 4.\n\n1st term: 4\n\n2nd term: 4*2 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5\n\n3rd term: 5*2 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n\n4th term: 7*2 - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11\n\n5th term: 11*2 - 3 = 22 - 3 = 19\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula I can derive for the nth term.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the nth term as a_n.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4\n\nAnd a_{n+1} = 2*a_n - 3\n\nI can try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence relation.\n\nI recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_{n+1} = r*a_n + k,\n\nThe solution can be found using the formula:\n\na_n = r^{n-1}*(a_1 - p) + p\n\nWhere p is the particular solution to the equation x = r*x + k.\n\nWait, in this case, a_{n+1} = 2*a_n - 3, so r=2, k=-3.\n\nFirst, find p such that p = 2*p - 3.\n\nSolving for p: p - 2*p = -3 => -p = -3 => p = 3.\n\nThen, the general solution is:\n\na_n = 2^{n-1}*(a_1 - p) + p\n\nPlugging in a_1 = 4 and p = 3:\n\na_n = 2^{n-1}*(4 - 3) + 3 = 2^{n-1}*1 + 3 = 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nSo, the nth term is 2^{n-1} + 3.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: 2^{0} + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: 2^{1} + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: 2^{2} + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: 2^{3} + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: 2^{4} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula checks out.\n\nTherefore, the 5th term is indeed 19.\n\nBut the problem seems straightforward, just following the rule step by step.\n\nMaybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the sequence as a transformation.\n\nEach term is transformed by multiplying by 2 and subtracting 3.\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 2*4 - 3 = 5\n\na_3 = 2*5 - 3 = 7\n\na_4 = 2*7 - 3 = 11\n\na_5 = 2*11 - 3 = 19\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of functions.\n\nDefine f(x) = 2x - 3\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = f(a_n)\n\nSo, a_2 = f(a_1) = f(4) = 5\n\na_3 = f(a_2) = f(5) = 7\n\na_4 = f(a_3) = f(7) = 11\n\na_5 = f(a_4) = f(11) = 19\n\nAgain, confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a shortcut for larger n.\n\nBut since n=5 is small, maybe not necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use iteration or look for a steady state.\n\nThe steady state would be when a_{n+1} = a_n = s\n\nSo, s = 2s - 3\n\nSolving for s: s - 2s = -3 => -s = -3 => s = 3\n\nSo, the sequence converges to 3 if it converges.\n\nBut in this case, starting from 4, and applying the rule, it seems to be increasing.\n\nSo, it doesn't converge, since it's increasing without bound.\n\nWait, but n=5 gives 19, which is higher than previous terms.\n\nBut in general, since each step multiplies by 2 and subtracts 3, it's growing rapidly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the sequence in terms of exponents.\n\nGiven that each step multiplies by 2, it's exponential growth.\n\nBut with the subtraction of 3, it's modified.\n\nBut I already have the closed-form formula, so perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can derive the formula differently.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a pattern in the differences.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 5\n\na_3 = 7\n\na_4 = 11\n\na_5 = 19\n\nDifferences:\n\n5 - 4 = 1\n\n7 - 5 = 2\n\n11 - 7 = 4\n\n19 - 11 = 8\n\nSo, the differences are 1, 2, 4, 8, which are powers of 2.\n\nSpecifically, 2^{0}, 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{3}, etc.\n\nSo, the difference between consecutive terms seems to be 2^{n-1}.\n\nWait, for n=2, difference is 1 = 2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3, difference is 2 = 2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4, difference is 4 = 2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5, difference is 8 = 2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the difference between a_{n} and a_{n-1} is 2^{n-2}.\n\nWait, but earlier I have a general formula a_n = 2^{n-1} + 3.\n\nLet me see if that matches.\n\na_n - a_{n-1} = (2^{n-1} + 3) - (2^{n-2} + 3) = 2^{n-1} - 2^{n-2} = 2^{n-2}(2 - 1) = 2^{n-2}\n\nWhich matches the differences I observed: 2^{n-2}.\n\nBut in my earlier observation, for n=2, difference is 2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the closed-form formula a_n = 2^{n-1} + 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the nth term without recursion.\n\nBut I already have a formula, and it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use induction to prove the formula.\n\nBase case: n=1\n\na_1 = 2^{1-1} + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches.\n\nInductive step: Assume a_k = 2^{k-1} + 3 for some k >=1.\n\nThen, a_{k+1} = 2*a_k - 3 = 2*(2^{k-1} + 3) - 3 = 2^k + 6 - 3 = 2^k + 3.\n\nWhich matches the formula for a_{k+1}.\n\nTherefore, by induction, the formula a_n = 2^{n-1} + 3 holds for all n >=1.\n\nSo, for n=5, a_5 = 2^{4} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.\n\nTherefore, the 5th term is 19.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the sequence in terms of binary operations.\n\nMultiplying by 2 is like a left shift in binary, and subtracting 3 is like subtracting 3.\n\nBut that might not be helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the sequence in terms of generating functions.\n\nLet\u2019s define the generating function for the sequence a_n.\n\nA(x) = sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n x^n\n\nGiven the recurrence a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3\n\nMultiply both sides by x^{n+1} and sum over n starting from 1:\n\nsum_{n=1}^infinity a_{n+1} x^{n+1} = 2 sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n x^{n+1} - 3 sum_{n=1}^infinity x^{n+1}\n\nThe left side is A(x) - a_1 x = A(x) - 4x\n\nThe right side is 2x A(x) - 3x / (1 - x)\n\nSo, A(x) - 4x = 2x A(x) - 3x / (1 - x)\n\nSolve for A(x):\n\nA(x) - 2x A(x) = 4x - 3x / (1 - x)\n\nA(x) (1 - 2x) = 4x - 3x / (1 - x)\n\nA(x) = [4x - 3x / (1 - x)] / (1 - 2x)\n\nThis seems complicated, and since I already have the closed-form formula, maybe generating functions are overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the error term or something.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the sequence as a linear combination of geometric sequences.\n\nGiven that a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3\n\nLet\u2019s consider the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} = 2 a_n\n\nThe solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n = c * 2^{n-1}\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (-3), I can assume a particular solution that is constant, say p.\n\nThen, p = 2p - 3\n\nSolving for p: p - 2p = -3 => -p = -3 => p = 3\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = c * 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = c * 2^{0} + 3 => 4 = c + 3 => c = 1\n\nTherefore, a_n = 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nWhich matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, the 5th term is a_5 = 2^{4} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use iteration to derive the formula.\n\nStarting with a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 2*a_1 - 3 = 2*4 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5\n\na_3 = 2*a_2 - 3 = 2*5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n\na_4 = 2*a_3 - 3 = 2*7 - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11\n\na_5 = 2*a_4 - 3 = 2*11 - 3 = 22 - 3 = 19\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a_n in terms of a_1.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\na_2 = 2*a_1 - 3\n\na_3 = 2*a_2 - 3 = 2*(2*a_1 - 3) - 3 = 4*a_1 - 6 - 3 = 4*a_1 - 9\n\na_4 = 2*a_3 - 3 = 2*(4*a_1 - 9) - 3 = 8*a_1 - 18 - 3 = 8*a_1 - 21\n\na_5 = 2*a_4 - 3 = 2*(8*a_1 - 21) - 3 = 16*a_1 - 42 - 3 = 16*a_1 - 45\n\nPlugging in a_1 = 4:\n\na_5 = 16*4 - 45 = 64 - 45 = 19\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the constants being subtracted.\n\nFor a_2: -3\n\na_3: -6 -3 = -9\n\na_4: -12 -3 = -15\n\na_5: -24 -3 = -27\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to stick with the closed-form formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the sequence in terms of telescoping series.\n\nBut that might be unnecessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence modulo some number.\n\nBut again, not necessary for finding the 5th term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the long-term behavior of the sequence.\n\nBut since it's growing exponentially, it goes to infinity.\n\nBut for n=5, it's 19.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of a function iteration.\n\nDefine f(x) = 2x - 3\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = f(a_n)\n\nSo, a_2 = f(a_1) = f(4) = 5\n\na_3 = f(a_2) = f(5) = 7\n\na_4 = f(a_3) = f(7) = 11\n\na_5 = f(a_4) = f(11) = 19\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the nth iterate of f.\n\nGiven f(x) = 2x - 3\n\nThen, f^n(x) = 2^n * x - 3*(2^n - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^n * x - 3*(2^n - 1)\n\nWait, that seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to find a fixed point.\n\nThe fixed point p satisfies p = 2p - 3 => p = 3\n\nThen, f(x) - p = 2(x - p)\n\nSo, f(x) - 3 = 2(x - 3)\n\nThen, f^n(x) - 3 = 2^n*(x - 3)\n\nTherefore, f^n(x) = 2^n*(x - 3) + 3\n\nTherefore, a_{n} = f^{n-1}(a_1)\n\nWait, let's see.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = f(a_1) = f(4) = 5\n\na_3 = f(a_2) = f(5) = 7\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, a_n = f^{n-1}(4)\n\nUsing the formula above:\n\nf^{n-1}(x) = 2^{n-1}*(x - 3) + 3\n\nTherefore, a_n = 2^{n-1}*(4 - 3) + 3 = 2^{n-1}*1 + 3 = 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nSame as before.\n\nTherefore, a_5 = 2^{4} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of a generating function.\n\nDefine A(x) = sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n x^n\n\nGiven a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3\n\nMultiply both sides by x^{n+1}:\n\na_{n+1} x^{n+1} = 2 a_n x^{n+1} - 3 x^{n+1}\n\nSum over n from 1 to infinity:\n\nsum_{n=1}^infinity a_{n+1} x^{n+1} = 2 sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n x^{n+1} - 3 sum_{n=1}^infinity x^{n+1}\n\nThe left side is A(x) - a_1 x = A(x) - 4x\n\nThe right side is 2x (A(x)) - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nTherefore:\n\nA(x) - 4x = 2x A(x) - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nSolve for A(x):\n\nA(x) - 2x A(x) = 4x - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nA(x) (1 - 2x) = 4x - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nA(x) = [4x - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)] / (1 - 2x)\n\nThis seems complicated, and since I already have the closed-form formula, maybe generating functions are not the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the z-transform or other advanced methods, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence in terms of differences.\n\nFirst differences: a_2 - a_1 = 1\n\na_3 - a_2 = 2\n\na_4 - a_3 = 4\n\na_5 - a_4 = 8\n\nSo, the first differences are 1, 2, 4, 8, which are powers of 2.\n\nSecond differences: 2 - 1 = 1\n\n4 - 2 = 2\n\n8 - 4 = 4\n\nWhich are again powers of 2.\n\nThis suggests that the sequence is described by a recursive formula involving exponential growth.\n\nBut again, since I already have the formula, maybe I don't need to explore this further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of binary numbers or something, but that might not be helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider writing a simple program or using a spreadsheet to compute the terms.\n\nBut for n=5, it's straightforward to compute manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can generalize the problem to finding the nth term.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3 with a_1 = 4\n\nWe can solve the recurrence as follows:\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} = 2 a_n\n\nThe solution is a_n = c * 2^{n-1}\n\nThen, find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation.\n\nSince the non-homogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution p is constant.\n\nSo, p = 2p - 3 => p = 3\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = c * 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nUse the initial condition a_1 = 4 to find c:\n\n4 = c * 2^{0} + 3 => 4 = c + 3 => c = 1\n\nTherefore, a_n = 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nTherefore, a_5 = 2^{4} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can verify this by solving the recurrence using generating functions.\n\nDefine A(x) = sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n x^n\n\nGiven a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3\n\nMultiply both sides by x^{n+1}:\n\na_{n+1} x^{n+1} = 2 a_n x^{n+1} - 3 x^{n+1}\n\nSum over n from 1 to infinity:\n\nsum_{n=1}^infinity a_{n+1} x^{n+1} = 2 sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n x^{n+1} - 3 sum_{n=1}^infinity x^{n+1}\n\nThe left side is A(x) - a_1 x = A(x) - 4x\n\nThe right side is 2x A(x) - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nTherefore:\n\nA(x) - 4x = 2x A(x) - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nSolve for A(x):\n\nA(x) - 2x A(x) = 4x - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nA(x) (1 - 2x) = 4x - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nA(x) = [4x - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)] / (1 - 2x)\n\nThis seems messy, and since I already have the closed-form formula, maybe it's better to stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can decompose A(x) into partial fractions.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider expanding the generating function as a power series and find the coefficient of x^5.\n\nBut again, for n=5, it's easier to use the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the 5th term is 19.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of a matrix.\n\nDefine a vector [a_n, 1]^T\n\nThen, [a_{n+1}, 1]^T = [2 -3; 0 1] * [a_n, 1]^T\n\nSo, [a_{n}, 1]^T = [2 -3; 0 1]^{n-1} * [a_1, 1]^T\n\nThen, [a_n, 1]^T = [2^{n-1} (-3)(2^{n-1} -1)/(2 - 1); 0 1] * [4; 1] = [2^{n-1}*4 + (-3)(2^{n-1} -1); 1] = [4*2^{n-1} - 3*2^{n-1} + 3; 1] = [2^{n-1}(4 - 3) + 3; 1] = [2^{n-1} + 3; 1]\n\nTherefore, a_n = 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nAgain, same formula.\n\nTherefore, a_5 = 2^{4} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence in terms of characteristic equations.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3\n\nWhich can be written as a_{n+1} - 2 a_n = -3\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 2 = 0 => r = 2\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = c * 2^{n-1}\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution p is constant.\n\nSo, p - 2p = -3 => -p = -3 => p = 3\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + p = c * 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = c * 2^{0} + 3 => 4 = c + 3 => c = 1\n\nTherefore, a_n = 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nTherefore, a_5 = 2^{4} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of summations.\n\nGiven a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange: a_{n+1} - 3 = 2(a_n - 3)\n\nLet b_n = a_n - 3\n\nThen, b_{n+1} = 2 b_n\n\nWith b_1 = a_1 - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nTherefore, b_n = 2^{n-1} b_1 = 2^{n-1} * 1 = 2^{n-1}\n\nTherefore, a_n = b_n + 3 = 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nAgain, same formula.\n\nTherefore, a_5 = 2^{4} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider generating the sequence in a table.\n\nn | a_n\n\n1 | 4\n\n2 | 5\n\n3 | 7\n\n4 | 11\n\n5 | 19\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can plot the sequence to see its behavior.\n\nBut for n=5, it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of financial calculations, like compound interest or something, but that might not be applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence in terms of population growth, where each term represents the population at a certain time, growing by a factor of 2 and then decreasing by 3.\n\nBut again, for n=5, it's sufficient to compute directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence in terms of physics, like a ball bouncing with each bounce reaching half the height minus 3 units, but that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of geometric series or something, but since it's not a geometric series, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence in terms of computer algorithms, like a recursive function that computes each term.\n\nBut again, for n=5, direct computation is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of number theory, looking for patterns or properties.\n\nFor example, is a_n always odd for n >=2?\n\nFrom the terms: a_2=5 (odd), a_3=7 (odd), a_4=11 (odd), a_5=19 (odd)\n\nSo, seems like after the first term, all terms are odd.\n\nIs that always true?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAssume a_n is odd for n >=2.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 2*a_n - 3\n\nIf a_n is odd, then 2*a_n is even, and subtracting 3 (odd) results in even - odd = odd.\n\nTherefore, if a_n is odd, then a_{n+1} is odd.\n\nSince a_2=5 is odd, all subsequent terms are odd.\n\nTherefore, yes, for n >=2, a_n is always odd.\n\nBut for this problem, it's not directly relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence modulo 2.\n\na_1 = 4 \u2261 0 mod 2\n\na_2 = 5 \u2261 1 mod 2\n\na_3 = 7 \u2261 1 mod 2\n\na_4 = 11 \u2261 1 mod 2\n\na_5 = 19 \u2261 1 mod 2\n\nSo, from n=2 onwards, a_n \u2261 1 mod 2, which confirms that they are odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of binary representations.\n\nFor example:\n\na_1 = 4 = 100 in binary\n\na_2 = 5 = 101\n\na_3 = 7 = 111\n\na_4 = 11 = 1011\n\na_5 = 19 = 10011\n\nBut I don't see an immediate pattern that helps with finding the nth term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the differences between consecutive terms.\n\nAs earlier observed, the differences are 1, 2, 4, 8, which are powers of 2.\n\nSo, the difference between a_{n} and a_{n-1} is 2^{n-2}\n\nTherefore, a_n = a_{n-1} + 2^{n-2}\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the earlier formula a_n = 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nIf a_n = 2^{n-1} + 3, then a_{n} - a_{n-1} = 2^{n-1} + 3 - (2^{n-2} + 3) = 2^{n-1} - 2^{n-2} = 2^{n-2}(2 - 1) = 2^{n-2}\n\nWhich matches the differences 1, 2, 4, 8 for n=2,3,4,5.\n\nTherefore, the formula is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider summing up the differences to find a_n.\n\nStarting from a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = a_1 + 1 = 5\n\na_3 = a_2 + 2 = 7\n\na_4 = a_3 + 4 = 11\n\na_5 = a_4 + 8 = 19\n\nWhich again confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a_n in terms of a_1 and the sum of differences.\n\na_n = a_1 + sum_{k=2}^n (a_k - a_{k-1}) = a_1 + sum_{k=2}^n 2^{k-2}\n\nSum_{k=2}^n 2^{k-2} = sum_{m=0}^{n-2} 2^m = 2^{n-1} - 1\n\nTherefore, a_n = 4 + (2^{n-1} - 1) = 2^{n-1} + 3\n\nAgain, same formula.\n\nTherefore, a_5 = 2^{4} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of telescoping sums.\n\nBut I think I've covered enough methods to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider writing a recursive function to compute a_n.\n\nFor example, in Python:\n\ndef a(n):\n\nif n == 1:\n\nreturn 4\n\nelse:\n\nreturn 2 * a(n-1) - 3\n\nThen, a(5) = 2 * a(4) - 3 = 2 * 11 - 3 = 19\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write an iterative function.\n\ndef a(n):\n\na = 4\n\nfor i in range(2, n+1):\n\na = 2 * a - 3\n\nreturn a\n\nThen, for n=5:\n\nStart with a=4\n\nn=2: a=2*4-3=5\n\nn=3: a=2*5-3=7\n\nn=4: a=2*7-3=11\n\nn=5: a=2*11-3=19\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the closed-form formula directly in code.\n\ndef a(n):\n\nreturn 2**(n-1) + 3\n\nThen, a(5) = 2**4 + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nSimple and efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence in terms of Excel or another spreadsheet.\n\nCreate a column with n from 1 to 5.\n\nIn the adjacent column, start with a_1=4.\n\nThen, for each subsequent row, use the formula =2*above cell -3.\n\nFill down to n=5, and you should get 19.\n\nBut again, for n=5, manual calculation is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider plotting the sequence to visualize its growth.\n\nBut for n=5, it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the sequence in terms of discrete dynamical systems.\n\nThe recurrence a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3 is a linear discrete dynamical system.\n\nThe fixed point is p=3, as found earlier.\n\nThe system is unstable because the multiplier is 2, which is greater than 1 in absolute value.\n\nTherefore, the sequence diverges away from the fixed point.\n\nBut for this problem, that's not directly relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the z-transform of the sequence.\n\nDefine A(z) = sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n z^{-n}\n\nGiven a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3\n\nMultiply both sides by z^{-n-1} and sum over n from 1 to infinity:\n\nsum_{n=1}^infinity a_{n+1} z^{-n-1} = 2 sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n z^{-n-1} - 3 sum_{n=1}^infinity z^{-n-1}\n\nThe left side is A(z) - a_1 z^{-1}\n\nThe right side is 2 z^{-1} A(z) - 3 z^{-1} / (1 - z^{-1})\n\nTherefore:\n\nA(z) - 4 z^{-1} = 2 z^{-1} A(z) - 3 z^{-1} / (1 - z^{-1})\n\nSolve for A(z):\n\nA(z) - 2 z^{-1} A(z) = 4 z^{-1} - 3 z^{-1} / (1 - z^{-1})\n\nA(z) (1 - 2 z^{-1}) = 4 z^{-1} - 3 z^{-1} / (1 - z^{-1})\n\nA(z) = [4 z^{-1} - 3 z^{-1} / (1 - z^{-1})] / (1 - 2 z^{-1})\n\nThis seems complicated, and since I already have the closed-form formula, maybe z-transform is not necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the Laplace transform or other integral transforms, but that's not applicable to discrete sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider generating functions in a different way.\n\nDefine A(x) = sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n x^n\n\nGiven a_{n+1} = 2 a_n - 3\n\nMultiply both sides by x^{n+1}:\n\na_{n+1} x^{n+1} = 2 a_n x^{n+1} - 3 x^{n+1}\n\nSum over n from 1 to infinity:\n\nsum_{n=1}^infinity a_{n+1} x^{n+1} = 2 sum_{n=1}^infinity a_n x^{n+1} - 3 sum_{n=1}^infinity x^{n+1}\n\nThe left side is A(x) - a_1 x = A(x) - 4x\n\nThe right side is 2x A(x) - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nTherefore:\n\nA(x) - 4x = 2x A(x) - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nSolve for A(x):\n\nA(x) - 2x A(x) = 4x - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nA(x) (1 - 2x) = 4x - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nA(x) = [4x - 3 x^2 / (1 - x)] / (1 - 2x)\n\nThis seems too involved for this problem, so I'll stop here.\n\nIn conclusion, the 5th term of the sequence is 19.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]"
