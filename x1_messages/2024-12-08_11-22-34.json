        "content": "Let's see here. I've got this sequence: 3, 9, 27, 81, and it goes on like that. I need to find the 8th term. Hmm, first thing I notice is that each number seems to be multiplied by 3 to get the next one. Let me check:\n\n- 3 multiplied by 3 is 9.\n\n- 9 multiplied by 3 is 27.\n\n- 27 multiplied by 3 is 81.\n\nYeah, that's consistent. So, it's a geometric sequence where each term is 3 times the previous one. In general, for a geometric sequence, the nth term can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[a_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(a_n\\) is the nth term,\n\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the common ratio,\n\n- \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\(a_1 = 3\\),\n\n- \\(r = 3\\),\n\n- \\(n = 8\\).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[a_8 = 3 \\times 3^{(8-1)} = 3 \\times 3^7\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(3^7\\). Let's see:\n\n\\[3^1 = 3\\]\\[3^2 = 9\\]\\[3^3 = 27\\]\\[3^4 = 81\\]\\[3^5 = 243\\]\\[3^6 = 729\\]\\[3^7 = 2187\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[a_8 = 3 \\times 2187 = 6561\\]\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Is \\(3^7\\) really 2187? Let me verify:\n\n\\[3^6 = 729\\]\\[3^7 = 729 \\times 3 = 2187\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, \\(a_8 = 3 \\times 2187 = 6561\\).\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the sequence as powers of 3:\n\n- 3 is \\(3^1\\),\n\n- 9 is \\(3^2\\),\n\n- 27 is \\(3^3\\),\n\n- 81 is \\(3^4\\),\n\nSo, the nth term is \\(3^{n}\\).\n\nWait, but according to this, the first term would be \\(3^1 = 3\\), which matches, and the second term \\(3^2 = 9\\), and so on. So, the nth term is \\(3^n\\).\n\nTherefore, the 8th term would be \\(3^8\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated \\(3 \\times 3^7 = 3^8\\), which is consistent.\n\nSo, \\(3^8 = 6561\\).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me calculate \\(3^8\\) directly:\n\n\\[3^1 = 3\\]\\[3^2 = 9\\]\\[3^3 = 27\\]\\[3^4 = 81\\]\\[3^5 = 243\\]\\[3^6 = 729\\]\\[3^7 = 2187\\]\\[3^8 = 6561\\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence again:\n\n\\[a_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)}\\]\n\nWith \\(a_1 = 3\\), \\(r = 3\\), and \\(n = 8\\):\n\n\\[a_8 = 3 \\times 3^{7} = 3^8 = 6561\\]\n\nOr, if I consider the general formula for a geometric sequence starting with \\(a_1\\), then yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the exponents are increasing by one for each term:\n\n- Term 1: \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n\n- Term 2: \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n\n- Term 3: \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n\n- Term 4: \\(3^4 = 81\\)\n\n- Term 5: \\(3^5 = 243\\)\n\n- Term 6: \\(3^6 = 729\\)\n\n- Term 7: \\(3^7 = 2187\\)\n\n- Term 8: \\(3^8 = 6561\\)\n\nSo, the 8th term is 6561.\n\nJust to make sure there isn't any other pattern I'm missing, let's consider if it could be something else. For example, maybe it's not strictly geometric, but that seems unlikely given the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a sequence where each term is multiplied by 3, but starting from a different initial term. But no, the first term is 3, and each subsequent term is indeed multiplied by 3.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the sequence could be defined differently, like recursively. For instance, \\(a_n = 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\), with \\(a_1 = 3\\). That would indeed generate the same sequence.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, it seems that the 8th term is 6561.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6561.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6561} \\]"
