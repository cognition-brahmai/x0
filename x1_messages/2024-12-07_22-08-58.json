Each step of your plan should be accompanied by an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the functions given an input string that can be either the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows users to search for information on Bing. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkPicker[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nKnowledgeModel[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g. What color is the dog, given #E1?\n\nThe output format should be as follows:\nPlan: [first action]\n#E0 = [function with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function with input parameter referencing previous evidence if necessary]\n...\nAnswer: [#En containing the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019 and what was their most notable work?"
