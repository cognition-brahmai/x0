        "content": "So there are 8 apples on the table to start with. John takes away 3 apples, so that means he has 3 apples now. Then Jane takes away 2 apples from the table, so the table now has 8 - 3 - 2 = 3 apples left. After that, Mary puts back 1 apple on the table, so now there are 3 + 1 = 4 apples on the table.\n\nBut the question is asking how many apples John has. From the beginning, John took 3 apples, and there's no mention of him giving any away or taking more, so he should still have those 3 apples.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about this differently. Let me see.\n\nWe have 8 apples initially on the table.\n\n- John takes away 3 apples: so John has 3 apples, and there are 5 left on the table.\n\n- Jane takes away 2 apples: so Jane has 2 apples, and there are 3 left on the table.\n\n- Mary puts back 1 apple: so now there are 4 apples on the table.\n\nBut the question is about how many apples John has. Since only John and Jane took apples away, and Mary added one back, but only to the table, not to anyone's possession.\n\nSo, John has the 3 apples he took, unless someone gave him more or he gave some away, but the problem doesn't say that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to be tricky by mentioning the apples on the table and the actions performed, but actually, John's apples aren't affected by what Mary does, since she's only interacting with the table.\n\nTherefore, John still has 3 apples.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose the question is about the apples on the table, and it's a misdirection to ask about John's apples.\n\nBut no, it specifically asks for John's apples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's confusion about the sequence of events.\n\nLet me outline the sequence again:\n\n1. 8 apples on the table.\n\n2. John takes 3 apples away. Now, John has 3 apples, and there are 5 left on the table.\n\n3. Jane takes 2 apples away. Now, Jane has 2 apples, and there are 3 left on the table.\n\n4. Mary puts back 1 apple. Now, there are 4 apples on the table.\n\nUnless something else happens, John's apple count hasn't changed.\n\nSo, John has 3 apples.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
