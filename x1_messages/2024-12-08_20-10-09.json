        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 7 math books, 5 physics books, and 4 chemistry books on a shelf, making a total of 7 + 5 + 4 = 16 books. I need to choose 3 books, and at least one of them must be a math book.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of ways to choose 3 books out of 16 without any restrictions is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. So, \\( C(16, 3) \\) would be \\( \\frac{16!}{3!(16 - 3)!} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 560 \\) ways.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that at least one book is a math book. To find this, I can use the principle of complementary counting. That means I'll calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 books without any restrictions and subtract the number of ways to choose 3 books with no math books.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 books with no math books would be choosing all 3 books from the physics and chemistry books only. There are 5 physics books and 4 chemistry books, making a total of 5 + 4 = 9 books that are not math books.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 books from these 9 non-math books is \\( C(9, 3) = \\frac{9!}{3!(9 - 3)!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 84 \\) ways.\n\nNow, subtracting this from the total number of ways without restrictions gives me the number of ways to choose at least one math book:\n\n560 (total ways) - 84 (ways with no math books) = 476 ways.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it directly by considering the different scenarios where I have at least one math book. That means I could have:\n\n1. Exactly one math book and two non-math books.\n\n2. Exactly two math books and one non-math book.\n\n3. All three math books.\n\nLet's calculate each of these scenarios separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, exactly one math book and two non-math books:\n\nNumber of ways to choose one math book from seven: \\( C(7, 1) = 7 \\).\n\nNumber of ways to choose two non-math books from nine: \\( C(9, 2) = \\frac{9!}{2!(9 - 2)!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = 36 \\).\n\nSo, the total for this scenario is 7 \u00d7 36 = 252 ways.\n\nSecond, exactly two math books and one non-math book:\n\nNumber of ways to choose two math books from seven: \\( C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7 - 2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21 \\).\n\nNumber of ways to choose one non-math book from nine: \\( C(9, 1) = 9 \\).\n\nSo, the total for this scenario is 21 \u00d7 9 = 189 ways.\n\nThird, all three math books:\n\nNumber of ways to choose three math books from seven: \\( C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35 \\) ways.\n\nNow, adding up all these scenarios: 252 + 189 + 35 = 476 ways.\n\nThis matches the previous result I got using complementary counting. So, I'm confident that 476 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, could I use probability here? Well, probability might not be necessary since we're dealing with combinations here, but I could think about it in terms of probabilities if I wanted to.\n\nBut sticking with combinations, I think the approach I took is solid. Whether I use complementary counting or direct calculation by considering each scenario separately, I end up with the same answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is 476 ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{476} \\]"
