        "content": "So there are 7 billion people in the world, and each person has an average of 5 close friends. I need to find out how many total friendships exist based on this information.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a friendship is in this context. Assuming that friendship is a mutual relationship, meaning if person A is friends with person B, then person B is also friends with person A. So each friendship involves two people.\n\nGiven that, if I simply multiply the number of people by the average number of friends per person, I might be double-counting each friendship because each friendship is counted once for each person involved.\n\nSo, if there are 7 billion people and each has 5 friends, the total number of friendships, considering each friendship is between two people, should be (7 billion * 5) / 2.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n7,000,000,000 people * 5 friends per person = 35,000,000,000 friendships counted, but since each friendship is counted twice, I need to divide by 2.\n\n35,000,000,000 / 2 = 17,500,000,000 friendships.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider if there's any possibility of one-sided friendships or any other factors that could affect this calculation.\n\nIn reality, friendships might not always be mutual. There could be one-sided friendships where person A considers person B a friend, but person B does not consider person A a friend. However, the problem states \"close friends,\" which might imply a mutual relationship.\n\nAdditionally, there could be overlapping friendships, meaning that friends of friends might create complex networks, but in terms of counting total friendships, that shouldn't affect the calculation as long as each unique pair is counted only once.\n\nAnother consideration is that people might have friends outside the defined population, but since the problem specifies \"each person has an average of 5 close friends,\" and doesn't mention friends outside the group, I'll assume that all friends are within the 7 billion people.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any people with zero friends. If some people have zero friends, then the average could still be 5, but the total number of friendships would be less than if everyone has at least one friend.\n\nWait, no. If some people have zero friends, that would lower the average number of friends per person. So, if the average is exactly 5, then the total number of friendships should still be (7 billion * 5) / 2, assuming that friendships are mutual.\n\nLet me think about it differently. I can model this as a graph, where each person is a node, and each friendship is an edge connecting two nodes.\n\nIn graph theory, the sum of the degrees (number of edges connected to a node) divided by 2 equals the number of edges in the graph. This is because each edge contributes to the degree of two nodes.\n\nSo, in this case, the sum of the degrees is 7 billion times 5, which is 35 billion. Therefore, the number of edges, or friendships, is 35 billion divided by 2, which is 17.5 billion.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about selecting pairs of people and determining if they are friends. The total number of possible pairs is combinations of 7 billion people taken 2 at a time, which is (7 billion choose 2) = (7,000,000,000 * 6,999,999,999) / 2, which is approximately 24,999,999,995 billion pairs.\n\nBut that's the total possible number of friendships if everyone is friends with everyone else, which is not the case here. We're given that each person has an average of 5 friends, so the actual number of friendships is much smaller.\n\nWait, no. The total possible number of friendships is indeed the number of possible pairs, but in reality, only a small fraction of those pairs are actual friendships.\n\nGiven the average number of friends per person, we can calculate the actual number of friendships, as I did earlier.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the total number of friendships is equal to the number of unique pairs of friends.\n\nSo, if each person has 5 friends, and friendships are mutual, then the total number of unique friendships is (7 billion * 5) / 2 = 17.5 billion.\n\nThis seems consistent across different approaches.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. For example, could there be friendships that involve more than two people? Like a group friendship, where multiple people are all friends with each other.\n\nIn traditional graph theory, friendships are modeled as pairwise connections, so a group friendship would be represented by multiple pairwise friendships.\n\nTherefore, the calculation should still hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some friendships are counted multiple times if there are overlapping social circles, but again, in graph theory, each unique pair is counted only once, regardless of how many mutual friends they have.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of friendships is 17.5 billion.\n\nWait, but in reality, the number of friendships might not be exactly 17.5 billion, because averages can be affected by variations in the number of friends per person.\n\nFor example, if some people have many more than 5 friends and others have fewer, the average could still be 5, but the distribution might affect the total number of unique friendships.\n\nHowever, in terms of calculating the expected number based on the average, the calculation is valid.\n\nAlternatively, if the distribution of friends per person is highly skewed, it could affect the total number of unique friendships, but with the information given, I have to assume that the average is representative.\n\nTherefore, the total number of friendships is approximately 17.5 billion.\n\nSo, the final answer is 17,500,000,000 friendships.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{17500000000} \\]"
