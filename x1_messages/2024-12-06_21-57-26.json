        "content": "So the company has 120 employees, and each one works 40 hours per week. That makes sense. Now, they're planning to increase their workforce by 25%. I need to find out how many additional hours will be worked weekly because of this increase.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many new employees are being added. A 25% increase on 120 employees. So, 25% of 120 is calculated by 120 multiplied by 0.25. Let me do that: 120 * 0.25 = 30. So, they're adding 30 new employees.\n\nEach new employee works 40 hours per week, just like the existing ones. So, the additional hours worked weekly would be the number of new employees times the hours each works per week. That is 30 employees * 40 hours/employee = 1200 hours.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe in terms of the total hours before and after the increase.\n\nInitially, with 120 employees, total hours per week are 120 * 40 = 4800 hours.\n\nAfter a 25% increase in workforce, the new number of employees is 120 + 30 = 150 employees.\n\nTotal hours after the increase would be 150 * 40 = 6000 hours.\n\nSo, the additional hours are 6000 - 4800 = 1200 hours.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, the additional hours worked weekly are 1200 hours.\n\nBut let's think about this another way. If the workforce increases by 25%, and each employee works the same number of hours, then the total hours worked should also increase by 25%.\n\nSo, 25% of the original total hours is the additional hours.\n\nOriginal total hours are 4800 hours, as calculated before.\n\n25% of 4800 is 4800 * 0.25 = 1200 hours.\n\nAgain, that's the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 1200 additional hours worked weekly.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
