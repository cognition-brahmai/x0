        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to choose a committee of 4 people from a group of 10 people, and there must be at least one man and one woman included. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many total ways there are to choose 4 people from 10 without any restrictions. That sounds like a combination problem, right? The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 4 people from 10 is C(10, 4). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 210.\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to choose any 4 people from 10.\n\nBut there's a condition: the committee must include at least one man and one woman. That means I can't have all men or all women in the committee.\n\nSo, maybe I can find out how many committees are all men and how many are all women, and then subtract those from the total number of committees.\n\nLet me assume that among the 10 people, there are both men and women. But the problem doesn't specify how many men and how many women there are. Does that matter?\n\nWait a minute, actually, it does matter because the number of all-male and all-female committees depends on how many men and women there are in the group of 10.\n\nHmm, the problem doesn't specify the number of men and women in the group of 10. Does that mean I have to assume there are enough men and women to form the committees?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the answer in terms of the number of men and women.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nLet's consider the possible distributions of men and women in the committee.\n\nSince there must be at least one man and one woman, the possible scenarios are:\n\n- 1 man and 3 women\n\n- 2 men and 2 women\n\n- 3 men and 1 woman\n\nSo, I can calculate the number of ways for each of these scenarios and then add them up.\n\nBut again, to calculate these, I need to know how many men and how many women there are in the group of 10.\n\nWait, maybe I can assume that there are m men and w women in the group, where m + w = 10.\n\nThen, the number of ways to choose 1 man and 3 women would be C(m, 1) \u00d7 C(w, 3).\n\nSimilarly, 2 men and 2 women would be C(m, 2) \u00d7 C(w, 2), and 3 men and 1 woman would be C(m, 3) \u00d7 C(w, 1).\n\nSo, the total number of ways would be:\n\nC(m, 1) \u00d7 C(w, 3) + C(m, 2) \u00d7 C(w, 2) + C(m, 3) \u00d7 C(w, 1).\n\nBut since I don't know m and w, and m + w = 10, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal committees: C(10, 4) = 210.\n\nSubtract the number of all-male committees and all-female committees.\n\nSo, number of committees with at least one man and one woman = total committees - all-male committees - all-female committees.\n\nBut again, to find the number of all-male committees, I need to know how many men there are, and similarly for all-female committees.\n\nThis seems like a dead end without knowing the number of men and women.\n\nWait a second, maybe the problem expects me to assume that there are at least 4 men and at least 4 women in the group of 10, so that it's possible to have all-male and all-female committees.\n\nBut even then, without knowing the exact numbers, I can't compute C(m, 4) and C(w, 4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is missing some information, or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose I select any 4 people from 10, which is 210 ways, as I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that there is at least one man and one woman.\n\nThis is equivalent to total committees minus the committees that are all men minus the committees that are all women.\n\nSo, number of valid committees = C(10, 4) - C(m, 4) - C(w, 4).\n\nBut again, without knowing m and w, I can't compute this.\n\nWait, but I know that m + w = 10.\n\nMaybe I can express C(w, 4) in terms of m.\n\nSince w = 10 - m, C(w, 4) = C(10 - m, 4).\n\nSo, number of valid committees = C(10, 4) - C(m, 4) - C(10 - m, 4).\n\nBut this still depends on m, which is unknown.\n\nUnless there's a symmetry or something that allows me to find a numerical answer without knowing m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the group has an equal number of men and women, say 5 men and 5 women.\n\nIf that's the case, then m = 5, w = 5.\n\nSo, number of all-male committees = C(5, 4) = 5.\n\nSimilarly, number of all-female committees = C(5, 4) = 5.\n\nTherefore, number of valid committees = 210 - 5 - 5 = 200.\n\nSo, the answer would be 200.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify that there are equal numbers of men and women. It just says there are 10 people, and I need to choose 4 with at least one man and one woman.\n\nSo, assuming equal numbers might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the context of the problem, it's safe to assume equal numbers.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that there are enough men and women to form the committees.\n\nFor example, if there are at least 4 men and at least 4 women, then C(m, 4) and C(w, 4) can be calculated.\n\nBut again, without knowing m and w, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I select one man and one woman first, ensuring that there is at least one of each, and then select the remaining two members from the remaining people.\n\nSo, number of ways = C(m, 1) \u00d7 C(w, 1) \u00d7 C(8, 2).\n\nBut this overcounts because the remaining two can be both men, both women, or one of each.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach.\n\nMoreover, this approach counts each committee multiple times because the selection of man and woman is separate from the selection of the remaining members.\n\nSo, this might not be the best way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the total number of committees with at least one man and one woman is the total number of committees minus the all-male and all-female committees.\n\nWhich is what I thought earlier.\n\nBut without knowing m and w, I can't compute C(m, 4) and C(w, 4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that doesn't require knowing m and w.\n\nWait, maybe I can use generating functions or something like that.\n\nBut that might be too complicated for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the number of ways is the same regardless of the distribution of men and women, as long as there are at least 4 men and at least 4 women.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the group has exactly 5 men and 5 women.\n\nIn that case, as I calculated earlier, number of valid committees = 210 - 5 - 5 = 200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is missing some information, and I should consider all possible cases for the number of men and women.\n\nFor example, m can range from 4 to 6, assuming there are at least 4 men and at least 4 women.\n\nWait, but m can be from 4 to 6 only if w is from 6 to 4, but m + w = 10.\n\nWait, m can be from 4 to 6 if w is from 6 to 4, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, if m is 4, then w is 6; if m is 5, w is 5; if m is 6, w is 4.\n\nSo, m can be 4, 5, or 6.\n\nBut why would I assume m is between 4 and 6?\n\nBecause if m is less than 4, then there can't be an all-male committee, and similarly if w is less than 4, there can't be an all-female committee.\n\nBut the problem states that there must be at least one man and one woman, which implies that there are at least one man and one woman in the group.\n\nBut to have all-male or all-female committees of 4, there need to be at least 4 men or at least 4 women.\n\nSo, if m < 4, then there are no all-male committees, and similarly if w < 4, no all-female committees.\n\nSo, I need to consider different cases based on the values of m and w.\n\nCase 1: m >= 4 and w >= 4.\n\nThen, number of valid committees = C(10, 4) - C(m, 4) - C(w, 4).\n\nCase 2: m >= 4 and w < 4.\n\nThen, there are no all-female committees, so number of valid committees = C(10, 4) - C(m, 4).\n\nCase 3: m < 4 and w >= 4.\n\nThen, there are no all-male committees, so number of valid committees = C(10, 4) - C(w, 4).\n\nCase 4: m < 4 and w < 4.\n\nBut in this case, m + w = 10, so if m < 4, then w > 6, which contradicts w < 4. So, this case is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I need to consider only the first three cases.\n\nBut without knowing m and w, I can't compute specific numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that m and w are both at least 4.\n\nIn that case, the number of valid committees is 210 - C(m, 4) - C(w, 4).\n\nBut again, without knowing m and w, this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different way to approach this problem.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of complementary counting.\n\nTotal committees minus the committees that don't meet the condition.\n\nCommittees that don't meet the condition are all-male or all-female committees.\n\nSo, number of valid committees = C(10, 4) - [C(m, 4) + C(w, 4)].\n\nBut again, without knowing m and w, this seems stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express m in terms of w, since m + w = 10.\n\nSo, m = 10 - w.\n\nThen, C(m, 4) = C(10 - w, 4), and C(w, 4) = C(w, 4).\n\nSo, number of valid committees = C(10, 4) - C(10 - w, 4) - C(w, 4).\n\nBut this still doesn't help without knowing w.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a symmetry here that I can exploit.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that C(m, 4) + C(w, 4) = C(10 - w, 4) + C(w, 4).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider generating functions or other combinatorial identities.\n\nBut that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved under the assumption that the group has an equal number of men and women.\n\nIn that case, m = w = 5, and as I calculated earlier, number of valid committees = 210 - 5 - 5 = 200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach altogether.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about selecting at least one man and one woman as selecting any committee and subtracting the all-male and all-female committees.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nBut again, without knowing m and w, I can't get a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is missing some information, and I should consider that m and w are such that there are at least 4 men and at least 4 women.\n\nIn that case, m >= 4 and w >= 4, with m + w = 10.\n\nSo, m can be 4, 5, or 6.\n\nSimilarly, w can be 4, 5, or 6.\n\nBut in each of these cases, the number of all-male and all-female committees would be different.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If m = 4 and w = 6, then C(m, 4) = C(4, 4) = 1, and C(w, 4) = C(6, 4) = 15.\n\nSo, number of valid committees = 210 - 1 - 15 = 194.\n\n- If m = 5 and w = 5, then C(m, 4) = C(5, 4) = 5, and C(w, 4) = C(5, 4) = 5.\n\nSo, number of valid committees = 210 - 5 - 5 = 200.\n\n- If m = 6 and w = 4, then C(m, 4) = C(6, 4) = 15, and C(w, 4) = C(4, 4) = 1.\n\nSo, number of valid committees = 210 - 15 - 1 = 194.\n\nSo, in two of the cases, the number is 194, and in one case, it's 200.\n\nBut without knowing m and w, I can't determine a single numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to express the answer in terms of m and w.\n\nIn that case, the number of valid committees is C(10, 4) - C(m, 4) - C(w, 4).\n\nBut that seems unsatisfactory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to be interpreted as: from a group of 10 people consisting of both men and women, choose a committee of 4 with at least one man and one woman.\n\nIn that case, without specified numbers of men and women, perhaps the answer should be expressed in terms of m and w.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, as the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as: from a group of 10 people consisting of 5 men and 5 women, choose a committee of 4 with at least one man and one woman.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be 210 - 5 - 5 = 200.\n\nThis seems like a plausible assumption, as having equal numbers of men and women is common in such problems if not specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is missing some information, and I should consider that m and w are such that there are at least 4 men and at least 4 women.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be 200, as in the previous scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using probabilities or expected values, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and there's a simpler way to approach it.\n\nWait a second, maybe I can think about selecting at least one man and one woman as the total selections minus the selections that are all same gender.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, number of valid committees = C(10, 4) - [C(m, 4) + C(w, 4)].\n\nBut without knowing m and w, I can't compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express C(m, 4) + C(w, 4) in terms of C(10, 4).\n\nBut I don't see an immediate relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the inclusion-exclusion principle in a different way.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of ways to choose a committee with at least one man and one woman is the sum of the ways to choose 1 man and 3 women, 2 men and 2 women, and 3 men and 1 woman.\n\nSo, number of valid committees = C(m, 1) \u00d7 C(w, 3) + C(m, 2) \u00d7 C(w, 2) + C(m, 3) \u00d7 C(w, 1).\n\nBut again, without knowing m and w, this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express this sum in terms of m and w, but I don't see it immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the binomial theorem or some other combinatorial identity to simplify this expression.\n\nBut that might be too involved for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering specific cases, but without knowing m and w, that seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach, and there's a simpler way to think about this.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that the total number of committees is C(10, 4) = 210.\n\nThen, the number of committees with at least one man and one woman is equal to the total committees minus the all-male committees minus the all-female committees.\n\nSo, number of valid committees = 210 - C(m, 4) - C(w, 4).\n\nBut again, without knowing m and w, I can't compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find C(m, 4) + C(w, 4) using other known quantities.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nI know that m + w = 10.\n\nIs there a relationship between C(m, 4), C(w, 4), and C(10, 4)?\n\nNot directly, but perhaps I can express C(m, 4) + C(w, 4) in terms of m and w.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that C(m, 4) + C(w, 4) = C(10, 4) - C(m, 3) \u00d7 w - C(w, 3) \u00d7 m.\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should give up and assume that the problem expects me to assume m = 5 and w = 5, leading to 200 valid committees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of \"at least one man and one woman.\"\n\nMaybe it's interpreted as at least one man and at least one woman, which is the same as not all men and not all women.\n\nWhich again brings me back to the previous approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about selecting one man and one woman first, and then selecting the remaining two members from the remaining 8 people.\n\nSo, number of ways = C(m, 1) \u00d7 C(w, 1) \u00d7 C(8, 2).\n\nBut this overcounts because some committees can be formed in multiple ways depending on which man and which woman are selected first.\n\nFor example, if there are multiple men and women in the committee, this method would count each committee multiple times.\n\nSo, this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion differently.\n\nNumber of committees with at least one man and at least one woman = (total committees) - (committees with no men) - (committees with no women).\n\nWhich is again 210 - C(m, 4) - C(w, 4).\n\nBut as before, without knowing m and w, this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing a pattern or using a known formula.\n\nBut I don't recall any specific formula for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the number of ways is independent of the distribution of men and women, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is missing some information, and I should make a reasonable assumption.\n\nIn that case, assuming m = 5 and w = 5 seems reasonable, leading to 200 valid committees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that there are at least 4 men and at least 4 women, in which case the answer would be 210 - C(4, 4) - C(6, 4) = 210 - 1 - 15 = 194, or 210 - C(5, 4) - C(5, 4) = 200, etc.\n\nBut without specific numbers, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to demonstrate that without knowing the number of men and women, the exact number of valid committees cannot be determined.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as the problem asks for a specific number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of \"at least one man and one woman.\"\n\nMaybe it means that both genders must be represented, but not necessarily in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nBut I think that's already accounted for in my earlier approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the expected value or average number of valid committees, but that seems too advanced for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation of total committees.\n\nBut C(10, 4) is definitely 210.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a combinatorial identity that relates C(m, 4) + C(w, 4) to other known quantities.\n\nBut I don't see one immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider generating functions for men and women, but that seems overly complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of binary choices, but that doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should accept that without knowing m and w, I can't find a numerical answer, and thus the problem is incomplete.\n\nBut that seems like giving up too easily.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the group has an equal number of men and women, leading to m = 5 and w = 5, and thus 200 valid committees.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, the answer is 200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
