        "content": "So there's this family with 2 parents and 4 children. Each child has 3 siblings. I need to find out how many people are in the family.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. There are 2 parents and 4 children, so initially, it seems like there are 2 + 4 = 6 people in the family.\n\nNow, the part that says \"each child has 3 siblings.\" Hmm, if there are 4 children, then each child should have 3 siblings because 4 children minus the child themselves is 3 siblings. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if each child has 3 siblings, that aligns with there being 4 children in total. Because if there were, say, 5 children, then each child would have 4 siblings, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the total number of people in the family. We have 2 parents and 4 children, so that's 6 people.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nLet's think about it differently. If I pick one child, that child has 3 siblings. So, total children would be the one child plus their 3 siblings, which is 4 children. That matches the given information.\n\nSo, adding the 2 parents, the total number of people in the family is 6.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Is there any trick here that I might be overlooking?\n\nSometimes, questions like these might include extended family members or something, but in this case, it clearly states \"2 parents and 4 children.\" So, no extended family is mentioned.\n\nAlso, it's specified that each child has 3 siblings, which confirms that there are no more or fewer children than stated.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people in the family is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
