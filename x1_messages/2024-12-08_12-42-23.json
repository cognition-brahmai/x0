        "content": "So I've got this problem about a rectangular garden. It says that the length is 6 meters more than its width, and the area is 70 square meters. I need to find the dimensions, which means finding both the length and the width. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, area = length \u00d7 width. That makes sense. Now, the problem gives me that the area is 70 square meters. So, I can write that as:\n\nlength \u00d7 width = 70\n\nBut I need to express both length and width in terms of one variable to solve for them. It says that the length is 6 meters more than the width. So, if I let the width be, say, w meters, then the length would be w + 6 meters. That seems straightforward.\n\nSo, replacing length and width in the area formula:\n\n(w + 6) \u00d7 w = 70\n\nNow, I have to solve for w in this equation. Let's expand it:\n\nw\u00b2 + 6w = 70\n\nHmm, I think I need to set this equation to zero to solve for w. So, subtracting 70 from both sides:\n\nw\u00b2 + 6w - 70 = 0\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation: w\u00b2 + 6w - 70 = 0. I need to solve for w. I can either factor this, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let's see if it factors easily.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -70 and add up to 6. Let's think: 10 and -7 multiply to -70 and add to 3, which is not 6. How about 14 and -5: 14 \u00d7 -5 = -70, and 14 + (-5) = 9, which is not 6. Not sure, maybe it's not factoring easily.\n\nMaybe I should use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is:\n\nw = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nFor my equation w\u00b2 + 6w - 70 = 0, a = 1, b = 6, and c = -70. Plugging these values in:\n\nw = [-6 \u00b1 sqrt(6\u00b2 - 4\u00d71\u00d7(-70))] / (2\u00d71)\n\nw = [-6 \u00b1 sqrt(36 + 280)] / 2\n\nw = [-6 \u00b1 sqrt(316)] / 2\n\nHmm, sqrt(316) seems a bit messy. Let's see if 316 can be simplified under the square root. 316 divided by 4 is 79, and 79 is a prime number. So, sqrt(316) = sqrt(4\u00d779) = 2sqrt(79). So, the equation becomes:\n\nw = [-6 \u00b1 2sqrt(79)] / 2\n\nI can simplify this by dividing each term by 2:\n\nw = -3 \u00b1 sqrt(79)\n\nNow, since width can't be negative, I'll take the positive value:\n\nw = -3 + sqrt(79)\n\nAlright, so the width is -3 + sqrt(79) meters. But that doesn't look very neat. Maybe there's a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again: area = length \u00d7 width = 70\n\nLength = width + 6\n\nSo, (width + 6) \u00d7 width = 70\n\nWhich gives width\u00b2 + 6width - 70 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nwidth = [-6 \u00b1 sqrt(36 + 280)] / 2\n\nwidth = [-6 \u00b1 sqrt(316)] / 2\n\nwidth = [-6 \u00b1 2sqrt(79)] / 2\n\nwidth = -3 \u00b1 sqrt(79)\n\nYes, same result. So, width is -3 + sqrt(79) meters. Now, to find the length, which is width + 6:\n\nlength = (-3 + sqrt(79)) + 6 = 3 + sqrt(79) meters.\n\nHmm, I was hoping for nice whole numbers, but maybe the dimensions are not integers. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nLet's plug these values back into the area formula to verify:\n\nlength \u00d7 width = (3 + sqrt(79)) \u00d7 (-3 + sqrt(79))\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n= 3\u00d7(-3) + 3\u00d7sqrt(79) + sqrt(79)\u00d7(-3) + sqrt(79)\u00d7sqrt(79)\n\n= -9 + 3sqrt(79) - 3sqrt(79) + 79\n\n= -9 + 79 + (3sqrt(79) - 3sqrt(79))\n\n= 70 + 0\n\n= 70\n\nYes, it checks out. So, the dimensions are width = -3 + sqrt(79) meters and length = 3 + sqrt(79) meters.\n\nBut, to make it more understandable, maybe I can approximate the square root of 79. sqrt(64) = 8 and sqrt(81) = 9, so sqrt(79) is a bit less than 9. Let's say sqrt(79) \u2248 8.9\n\nSo, width \u2248 -3 + 8.9 = 5.9 meters\n\nLength \u2248 3 + 8.9 = 11.9 meters\n\nSo, approximately, the garden is about 6 meters wide and 12 meters long.\n\nBut since the problem gives exact values, I should probably leave it in terms of square roots unless it asks for an approximation.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let's try assuming that the width is w meters, then the length is w + 6 meters, and the area is 70 square meters.\n\nSo, (w)(w + 6) = 70\n\nWhich again gives w\u00b2 + 6w - 70 = 0\n\nI end up with the same quadratic equation. So, unless I make an error in calculation, the solution should be w = -3 \u00b1 sqrt(79)\n\nSince width can't be negative, w = -3 + sqrt(79)\n\nAnd length = w + 6 = 3 + sqrt(79)\n\nI think that's the correct solution. Maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of square roots, or perhaps an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try completing the square to solve the quadratic equation.\n\nStarting with w\u00b2 + 6w - 70 = 0\n\nMove the constant term: w\u00b2 + 6w = 70\n\nComplete the square by adding (6/2)^2 = 9 to both sides:\n\nw\u00b2 + 6w + 9 = 70 + 9\n\n(w + 3)^2 = 79\n\nTake square roots: w + 3 = \u00b1sqrt(79)\n\nSo, w = -3 \u00b1 sqrt(79)\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed the solution sufficiently. The dimensions of the garden are:\n\nWidth: -3 + sqrt(79) meters \u2248 5.9 meters\n\nLength: 3 + sqrt(79) meters \u2248 11.9 meters\n\nSo, approximately 6 meters by 12 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the garden are \\boxed{width = -3 + \\sqrt{79} \\text{ meters}, \\ length = 3 + \\sqrt{79} \\text{ meters}} or approximately \\boxed{6 \\text{ meters by } 12 \\text{ meters}}."
