        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: \"In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability of drawing a red card and then a black card without replacement?\" Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about a standard deck of playing cards. There are 52 cards in total, divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Hearts and diamonds are red, and clubs and spades are black. So, there are 26 red cards and 26 black cards.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of drawing a red card first and then a black card, without replacing the first card back into the deck. That means once I draw the first card, it's out of the deck, and the second draw will be from the remaining 51 cards.\n\nProbability of two events happening in sequence, without replacement, is calculated by multiplying the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event given that the first event has already occurred. This is known as conditional probability.\n\nSo, let's find the probability of the first event: drawing a red card.\n\nThere are 26 red cards out of 52 total cards, so the probability is:\n\nP(Red first) = 26/52 = 1/2\n\nNow, given that the first card drawn was red, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, with 26 black cards remaining (since no black cards were removed in the first draw).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a black card second, given that the first card was red, is:\n\nP(Black second | Red first) = 26/51\n\nNow, to find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence, we multiply these two probabilities:\n\nP(Red first and Black second) = P(Red first) * P(Black second | Red first) = (1/2) * (26/51)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(1/2) * (26/51) = (1 * 26) / (2 * 51) = 26 / 102\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n26 \u00f7 2 = 13\n\n102 \u00f7 2 = 51\n\nSo, 13/51\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red card first and then a black card without replacement is 13/51.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there another way to approach this to confirm?\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the total number of ways to draw a red card first and a black card second, divided by the total number of ways to draw any two cards in sequence without replacement.\n\nThe number of ways to draw a red card first is 26 (since there are 26 red cards), and then the number of ways to draw a black card second is 26 (since there are 26 black cards left). So, the number of favorable outcomes is 26 * 26.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw any two cards in sequence without replacement is 52 * 51.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\nP = (26 * 26) / (52 * 51)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n26/52 = 1/2\n\nSo, P = (1/2) * (26/51) = 26/102 = 13/51\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations. But since the order matters here (first red, then black), it's more straightforward to use permutations or direct probability approach, which is what I did.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Suppose I consider the probability of drawing a black card first and then a red card. Would that be the same?\n\nLet's see:\n\nP(Black first) = 26/52 = 1/2\n\nP(Red second | Black first) = 26/51\n\nSo, P(Black first and Red second) = (1/2) * (26/51) = 13/51\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Interesting, so the probability of drawing a red followed by a black is the same as drawing a black followed by a red.\n\nThat makes sense because the number of red and black cards is the same.\n\nBut in this problem, we specifically want red first and then black.\n\nSo, 13/51 is the answer.\n\nLet me see if there's another perspective.\n\nSuppose I think about it as the probability of drawing a red card and then a black card, without replacement, from a standard deck.\n\nAnother way is to consider the entire sample space of drawing two cards without replacement, which is 52 choose 2, and then figure out how many of those pairs have a red first and black second.\n\nBut wait, that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nWait, actually, let's try it.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw two cards without replacement is C(52,2), which is 52*51/2 = 1326.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes: first card red and second card black.\n\nSince order matters here, it's not just combinations; it's permutations.\n\nWait, actually, in combinations, order doesn't matter, but in this case, order does matter because it's first and then second.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to think in terms of permutations.\n\nThe number of ways to draw a red first and then a black second is:\n\nNumber of red cards (26) times the number of black cards (26), which is 26*26 = 676.\n\nThen, the total number of possible two-card sequences without replacement is 52*51 = 2652.\n\nTherefore, P = 676 / 2652\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n676 \u00f7 4 = 169\n\n2652 \u00f7 4 = 663\n\nSo, 169/663\n\nWait, but earlier I got 13/51.\n\nLet's see if these are equal.\n\nLet's simplify 169/663.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 13:\n\n169 \u00f7 13 = 13\n\n663 \u00f7 13 = 51\n\nSo, 13/51\n\nYes, it's the same.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with 13/51.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 13/51.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I use the concept of conditional probability more formally.\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\n\nHere, A is drawing a red card first, and B is drawing a black card second given that the first was red.\n\nWe already have:\n\nP(A) = P(Red first) = 26/52 = 1/2\n\nP(B|A) = P(Black second | Red first) = 26/51\n\nTherefore, P(A and B) = (1/2) * (26/51) = 13/51\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something here?\n\nWell, maybe I should consider that after drawing the first red card, the number of remaining cards is 51, and the number of black cards is still 26, since no black cards were removed in the first draw.\n\nWait, actually, that's correct.\n\nSo, P(Black second | Red first) is indeed 26/51.\n\nAlternatively, if the first card drawn was black, then P(Black second | Black first) would be 25/51, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, no, I'm on the right track.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the deck is shuffled properly, but I think we can assume that the deck is well-shuffled, and each card has an equal probability of being drawn.\n\nAlso, since it's a standard deck, there are no jokers or any other cards that might alter the total count.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability of drawing a red card first and then a black card without replacement from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is 13/51.\n\nLet me just double-check the calculation one more time.\n\n(1/2) * (26/51) = 26/102 = 13/51\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 13/51 is approximately 0.2549 or about 25.49%.\n\nSo, there's a little over a 25% chance of this happening.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}} \\]"
