        "content": "The International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth approximately 15.5 times per day. To find out how many times it orbits in one week, we can calculate:\n\nOrbits per day: 15.5\n\nDays in a week: 7\n\nTotal orbits in one week = 15.5 orbits/day \u00d7 7 days = 108.5 orbits\n\nSince the ISS cannot complete half an orbit, we can consider it as approximately 108 orbits per week.\n\nHowever, for a more precise calculation, let's consider the exact orbital period of the ISS.\n\nThe ISS orbits the Earth once every 90 minutes approximately.\n\nThere are 1,0080 minutes in a week (60 minutes/hour \u00d7 24 hours/day \u00d7 7 days).\n\nSo, the number of orbits in one week would be:\n\nTotal minutes in a week / Orbital period\n\n= 1,0080 minutes / 90 minutes/orbit\n\n= 112 orbits per week\n\nTherefore, the ISS orbits the Earth approximately 112 times in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]"
