        "content": "I'm here to help you with your C++ programming task! You need to develop a basic banking system simulation that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and transfer money between accounts. You should implement classes for different account types like checking and savings, transactions, and customers. Additionally, you need to ensure proper exception handling and write unit tests to validate the functionality.\n\nFirst, let's break down the requirements to understand what needs to be done.\n\n1. **Classes to Implement:**\n   - **Customer:** This class should hold information about the bank customers, such as name, address, and contact details.\n   - **Account:** This is a base class for different types of accounts. It should have common properties like account number, balance, and methods for deposit and withdraw.\n   - **CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount:** These are derived classes from Account, each possibly having different properties or methods, such as overdraft limits or interest rates.\n   - **Transaction:** This class should handle transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. It might record transaction details like amount, date, and type.\n\n2. **Functionalities:**\n   - **Create Accounts:** Users should be able to create new accounts, specifying the type (checking or savings).\n   - **Deposit Funds:** Allow depositing money into an account.\n   - **Withdraw Funds:** Allow withdrawing money from an account, considering sufficient balance or overdraft limits.\n   - **Transfer Money:** Enable transferring funds from one account to another.\n\n3. **Exception Handling:**\n   - Handle cases like insufficient balance, invalid account numbers, or invalid transactions.\n\n4. **Unit Tests:**\n   - Write tests to ensure that each part of the system works correctly, such as successful deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, as well as proper handling of exceptions.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure this program.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Customer Class**\n\nThe Customer class should store information about the bank's customers. Each customer can have multiple accounts.\n\n```cpp\nclass Customer {\nprivate:\n    std::string name;\n    std::string address;\n    std::string contactInfo;\n    // List of accounts associated with this customer\n    std::vector<Account*> accounts;\npublic:\n    Customer(const std::string& name, const std::string& address, const std::string& contactInfo);\n    void addAccount(Account* account);\n    // Other methods to manage customer's accounts\n};\n```\n\n**Step 2: Define the Account Base Class**\n\nThe Account class is an abstract base class that defines common properties and methods for all account types.\n\n```cpp\nclass Account {\nprotected:\n    std::string accountNumber;\n    double balance;\npublic:\n    Account(const std::string& accountNumber, double initialBalance);\n    virtual ~Account() {}\n    virtual bool deposit(double amount);\n    virtual bool withdraw(double amount) = 0;\n    double getBalance() const;\n    // Other account-related methods\n};\n```\n\n**Step 3: Define Derived Account Classes**\n\nCreate CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount classes that inherit from Account and implement their specific behaviors.\n\n```cpp\nclass CheckingAccount : public Account {\n    double overdraftLimit;\npublic:\n    CheckingAccount(const std::string& accountNumber, double initialBalance, double overdraftLimit);\n    bool withdraw(double amount) override;\n};\n\nclass SavingsAccount : public Account {\n    double interestRate;\npublic:\n    SavingsAccount(const std::string& accountNumber, double initialBalance, double interestRate);\n    bool withdraw(double amount) override;\n    void applyInterest();\n};\n```\n\n**Step 4: Define the Transaction Class**\n\nThe Transaction class should handle various types of transactions.\n\n```cpp\nclass Transaction {\nprivate:\n    std::string transactionType;\n    double amount;\n    std::string date;\npublic:\n    Transaction(const std::string& transactionType, double amount);\n    void recordTransaction(Account* account);\n    // Other transaction-related methods\n};\n```\n\n**Step 5: Implement Exception Handling**\n\nDefine custom exceptions for handling errors like insufficient balance or invalid account numbers.\n\n```cpp\nclass InsufficientBalanceException : public std::exception {\npublic:\n    const char* what() const throw() {\n        return \"Insufficient balance.\";\n    }\n};\n\nclass InvalidAccountException : public std::exception {\npublic:\n    const char* what() const throw() {\n        return \"Invalid account number.\";\n    }\n};\n```\n\n**Step 6: Write Unit Tests**\n\nUse a testing framework like Google Test to write unit tests for your classes and methods.\n\n```cpp\nTEST(AccountTest, DepositTest) {\n    Account account(\"12345\", 0.0);\n    account.deposit(100.0);\n    EXPECT_EQ(account.getBalance(), 100.0);\n}\n\nTEST(AccountTest, WithdrawTest) {\n    Account account(\"12345\", 100.0);\n    EXPECT_TRUE(account.withdraw(50.0));\n    EXPECT_EQ(account.getBalance(), 50.0);\n    EXPECT_FALSE(account.withdraw(100.0)); // Insufficient balance\n}\n```\n\n**Step 7: Main Function**\n\nImplement the main function to create customers, accounts, and perform transactions.\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    try {\n        Customer customer(\"John Doe\", \"123 Street\", \"john@example.com\");\n        Account* checking = new CheckingAccount(\"C123\", 0.0, 100.0);\n        Account* savings = new SavingsAccount(\"S123\", 0.0, 0.05);\n        customer.addAccount(checking);\n        customer.addAccount(savings);\n\n        checking->deposit(1000.0);\n        savings->deposit(500.0);\n\n        checking->withdraw(1500.0); // Should use overdraft\n\n        Transaction transfer(\"Transfer\", 200.0);\n        transfer.recordTransaction(checking);\n        transfer.recordTransaction(savings);\n\n        std::cout << \"Final balances:\" << std::endl;\n        std::cout << \"Checking: \" << checking->getBalance() << std::endl;\n        std::cout << \"Savings: \" << savings->getBalance() << std::endl;\n    } catch (const std::exception& e) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis is a high-level overview of how you can structure your banking system simulation in C++. You'll need to fill in the details for each class and method, ensuring that you handle exceptions appropriately and write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any part of this implementation, feel free to ask!"
