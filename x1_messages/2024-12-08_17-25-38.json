        "content": "So, you've got a train traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, and you want to know how far it goes. Well, to figure this out, we can use the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nHere, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 3 hours. So, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 60 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 180 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the train travels 180 miles.\n\nBut, let's think a bit deeper. What does \"average speed\" really mean? It's the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, if the train's speed varies during the journey, as long as the overall distance divided by the overall time equals 60 mph, our calculation holds.\n\nAlso, it's important to ensure that the units are consistent. In this case, speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, so multiplying them directly gives us distance in miles, which is what we want.\n\nNow, if the speed wasn't constant, and we had different speeds for different parts of the journey, we'd need to calculate the distance for each part separately and then sum them up. But in this straightforward case, since the average speed is given and assumed constant over the entire journey, multiplying speed by time gives us the direct answer.\n\nAnother way to visualize this is to imagine the train covering 60 miles every hour. So, in one hour, it's at 60 miles, in two hours, 120 miles, and in three hours, 180 miles. It's a linear relationship between time and distance when speed is constant.\n\nMoreover, if you were to plot a graph with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis, the slope of the line would represent the speed. So, with a speed of 60 mph, the line would have a slope of 60, meaning for every hour passed, the distance increases by 60 miles.\n\nThis concept is fundamental in physics and everyday life, helping us plan travel times, understand motion, and even in engineering and transportation logistics.\n\nSo, in summary, the train travels 180 miles in 3 hours at an average speed of 60 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180 \\text{ miles}} \\]"
