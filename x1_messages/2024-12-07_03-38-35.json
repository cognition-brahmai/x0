Smart pointers are a great way to handle dynamic memory automatically, preventing memory leaks and making code safer and cleaner. We'll focus on `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, as they are the most commonly used smart pointers in C++.\n\nFirst, let's understand what smart pointers are. Smart pointers are objects that act like pointers but manage the lifetime of the objects they point to. They automatically deallocate the memory when it's no longer needed, which is a significant improvement over raw pointers that require manual deletion.\n\nWe'll create a simple custom class and demonstrate how `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` can be used to manage its instances.\n\n### Step 1: Define a Custom Class\n\nLet's create a simple class called `Resource` that simulates some resource that needs proper management, like files or network connections.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <memory>\n\nclass Resource {\npublic:\n    Resource() {\n        std::cout << \"Resource created\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    ~Resource() {\n        std::cout << \"Resource destroyed\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    void use() {\n        std::cout << \"Using resource\" << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Step 2: Using `std::unique_ptr`\n\n`std::unique_ptr` is a smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes of that object when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope.\n\n```cpp\nvoid demonstrateUniquePtr() {\n    std::unique_ptr<Resource> uniqueResource = std::make_unique<Resource>();\n    uniqueResource->use();\n    // No need to manually delete, unique_ptr handles it\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Using `std::shared_ptr`\n\n`std::shared_ptr` is a smart pointer that can share ownership of an object through copy operations, and the object is destroyed only when the last `shared_ptr` owning it is destroyed or reset.\n\n```cpp\nvoid demonstrateSharedPtr() {\n    std::shared_ptr<Resource> sharedResource = std::make_shared<Resource>();\n    {\n        std::shared_ptr<Resource> anotherShared = sharedResource;\n        anotherShared->use();\n        // sharedResource count is 2\n    }\n    // anotherShared is destroyed, count is 1\n    sharedResource->use();\n    // sharedResource is destroyed at the end of the function, Resource is deleted\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Main Function\n\nNow, let's put it all together in the `main` function.\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    std::cout << \"Demonstrating unique_ptr:\" << std::endl;\n    demonstrateUniquePtr();\n    std::cout << \"\\nDemonstrating shared_ptr:\" << std::endl;\n    demonstrateSharedPtr();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Resource Class**: This class has a constructor and destructor that print messages when an object is created and destroyed. It also has a `use` method to simulate using the resource.\n\n2. **unique_ptr Demonstration**: We create a `unique_ptr` to manage a `Resource` object. When the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope at the end of the function, it automatically deletes the `Resource` object.\n\n3. **shared_ptr Demonstration**: We create a `shared_ptr` to manage a `Resource` object. Inside a inner scope, we create another `shared_ptr` that shares ownership of the same `Resource`. When the inner scope ends, one `shared_ptr` is destroyed, but the `Resource` remains because another `shared_ptr` still owns it. Finally, when all `shared_ptr`s are destroyed, the `Resource` is deleted.\n\nThis example shows how smart pointers can automatically manage the lifetime of objects, making memory management easier and safer in C++."
