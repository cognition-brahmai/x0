        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a factory that makes two types of products, A and B. The production ratio is 3 units of A for every 2 units of B, and the total production per day is 500 units. I need to find out how many units of each product are produced daily.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the ratio means. A ratio of 3:2 for A to B means that for every 3 units of A, there are 2 units of B. So, in total, that's 3 + 2 = 5 units for each cycle of production.\n\nNow, the factory produces 500 units per day. I need to figure out how many of these are A and how many are B, given the ratio.\n\nMaybe I can think of it in terms of parts. Each cycle of production consists of 5 parts: 3 parts A and 2 parts B. So, the total number of cycles in a day would be the total units divided by the units per cycle, which is 500 divided by 5.\n\nLet me calculate that: 500 \u00f7 5 = 100. So, there are 100 cycles of production per day.\n\nNow, since each cycle produces 3 units of A, the total units of A produced per day would be 3 units/cycle \u00d7 100 cycles = 300 units of A.\n\nSimilarly, each cycle produces 2 units of B, so the total units of B produced per day would be 2 units/cycle \u00d7 100 cycles = 200 units of B.\n\nWait, let me check if this adds up to 500 units: 300 + 200 = 500. Yes, that matches the total production.\n\nAlternatively, I could use algebra to solve this. Let\u2019s denote the number of units of A as A and the number of units of B as B. According to the ratio, A/B = 3/2, which can be written as A = (3/2)B.\n\nAlso, the total production is A + B = 500.\n\nSubstituting A from the ratio into the total production equation: (3/2)B + B = 500.\n\nCombining terms: (3/2)B + (2/2)B = (5/2)B = 500.\n\nNow, solve for B: B = 500 \u00d7 (2/5) = 200.\n\nThen, A = (3/2) \u00d7 200 = 300.\n\nSo, again, A = 300 units and B = 200 units.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the fraction of total production that each product represents.\n\nThe ratio is 3:2, so the fraction for A is 3/(3+2) = 3/5, and for B it's 2/(3+2) = 2/5.\n\nTherefore, units of A = (3/5) \u00d7 500 = 300, and units of B = (2/5) \u00d7 500 = 200.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: the factory produces 300 units of product A and 200 units of product B daily.\n\nI think this makes sense. The ratio is maintained, and the total adds up to 500 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300 \\text{ units of A and } 200 \\text{ units of B}} \\]"
