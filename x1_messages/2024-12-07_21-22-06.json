        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a cylindrical water tank. The tank has a diameter of 12 feet and a height of 15 feet, and I need to find out its maximum capacity in gallons. The hint says that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the volume of the cylinder because the volume will tell me how much space is inside the tank, which corresponds to its capacity. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nNow, the problem gives me the diameter, which is 12 feet, but I need the radius. Remember that the radius is half of the diameter, so:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{12 \\, \\text{feet}}{2} = 6 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\nAlright, so the radius is 6 feet, and the height is 15 feet. Plugging these values into the volume formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (6)^2 (15) \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (36) (15) \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (540) \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 3.1416 \\times 540 \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 1696.46 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nSo, the volume of the tank is approximately 1696.46 cubic feet.\n\nBut I need the capacity in gallons, and I know that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, to find the capacity in gallons, I'll multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48:\n\n\\[ \\text{Capacity} = 1696.46 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\times 7.48 \\, \\text{gallons per cubic foot} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Capacity} \\approx 12694.56 \\, \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nSo, the maximum capacity of the tank is approximately 12,694.56 gallons.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, radius is half the diameter: 12 feet / 2 = 6 feet. That's correct.\n\nThen, volume formula: \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\). Plugging in the values: \\( V = \\pi \\times 6^2 \\times 15 = \\pi \\times 36 \\times 15 = \\pi \\times 540 \\). Using \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\), so \\( V \\approx 3.1416 \\times 540 = 1696.46 \\) cubic feet. That seems right.\n\nNow, converting cubic feet to gallons: 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons. So, 1696.46 cubic feet \u00d7 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 12694.56 gallons. Yeah, that looks correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a more precise value of \\( \\pi \\), but for practical purposes, 3.1416 is sufficiently accurate.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any need to account for units or if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, sometimes tanks aren't filled to the brim, but the problem asks for maximum capacity, so this should be fine.\n\nMoreover, ensuring that the diameter and height are in the same units, which they are (both in feet), so no conversion issues there.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to calculate this to verify. Perhaps using the formula for the volume of a cylinder in terms of diameter and height. I know that the area of the base can also be expressed as \\( \\pi \\times \\left( \\frac{d}{2} \\right)^2 \\), which is the same as \\( \\pi r^2 \\), so it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\pi d^2 h}{4} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\pi \\times (12)^2 \\times 15}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\pi \\times 144 \\times 15}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\pi \\times 2160}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\times 540 \\]\n\nWhich is the same as before, so that's good.\n\nThen, converting to gallons again gives the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The maximum capacity of the tank is approximately 12,694.56 gallons.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should round it to a more practical number. Depending on the context, rounding to the nearest gallon might be appropriate. So, 12,695 gallons.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify the number of decimal places, leaving it as 12,694.56 gallons is fine.\n\nAlright, that's it. I've got my answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12694.56 \\, \\text{gallons}} \\]"
