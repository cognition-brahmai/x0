        "content": "So, there's this problem about a family of 6 people where each person has one sibling, and I need to figure out how many pairs of siblings there are. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a family, siblings are people who have the same parents. So, if each person has one sibling, that means everyone has just one brother or one sister, right? No more, no less.\n\nSo, with 6 people, and each having one sibling, I need to find out how many unique pairs of siblings there are in total.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help. I can represent each person as a point, and connect them with a line if they are siblings.\n\nSince each person has only one sibling, each point will be connected to only one other point. So, in this diagram, there shouldn't be any points with multiple connections.\n\nWait a minute, this sounds like making pairs. Each pair consists of two siblings, and each person is in exactly one pair.\n\nSo, if there are 6 people, and they form pairs, then the number of pairs should be 6 divided by 2, which is 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, there are 3 pairs of siblings.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose the people are A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\nIf A is siblings with B, then B is siblings with A. That's one pair.\n\nSimilarly, C is siblings with D, and E is siblings with F. That's three pairs in total.\n\nWait, but the problem says each person has one sibling. So, in this arrangement, everyone has exactly one sibling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to pair them. Like, what if A is siblings with B, B is siblings with C, and C is siblings with A?\n\nWait, but in that case, A, B, and C would all be siblings, which means each of them has two siblings, not one. But the problem says each person has one sibling. So, that can't be the case.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to have disjoint pairs, where each pair is a separate unit, and no overlapping.\n\nSo, in a family of 6, with each person having one sibling, there are 3 pairs of siblings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 people out of 6 is \"6 choose 2,\" which is 15.\n\nBut that's the total number of possible pairs, not necessarily sibling pairs.\n\nIn this case, since each person has only one sibling, only 3 of those 15 pairs are actual sibling pairs.\n\nWait, but I already concluded that there are 3 pairs based on dividing 6 by 2.\n\nIs there another way to confirm this?\n\nLet me think about it mathematically.\n\nIf each person has one sibling, that means the family can be divided into pairs of siblings.\n\nLet me denote the pairs as (A,B), (C,D), and (E,F).\n\nIn this setup, A has only B as a sibling, B has only A, C has only D, and so on.\n\nThis satisfies the condition that each person has one sibling.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 pairs.\n\nAlternatively, suppose the family is structured differently, like a bunch of cousins or something, but the problem specifies that each person has one sibling, which implies that they are paired off.\n\nSo, I don't think there's any other way to interpret it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3 pairs of siblings.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any overlapping or shared siblings.\n\nFor example, if A is siblings with B, and B is siblings with C, then A, B, and C are all siblings, which means each has two siblings, which contradicts the condition that each person has only one sibling.\n\nTherefore, there can't be any overlapping like that.\n\nThus, the family must consist of disjoint pairs, each pair being siblings.\n\nHence, with 6 people, divided into pairs of 2, there are 3 pairs.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
