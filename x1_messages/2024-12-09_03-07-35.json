        "content": "Option E is the correct answer.\n\nLet's break this down. Stars don't just pop into existence; they have a lifecycle, much like living organisms. It starts with a nebula, which is essentially a cloud of dust and gas in space. When parts of this cloud become dense enough due to gravity, it can collapse and form a protostar. This is like the embryo stage of a star.\n\nAs the protostar continues to collapse, it heats up. When it gets hot enough in the core, nuclear fusion begins. This is where hydrogen atoms are fused into helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy\u2014this is what makes stars shine. This marks the beginning of the star's main sequence life, which is the longest and most stable phase.\n\nNow, what happens next depends on the star's mass. For stars like our Sun, after burning through their hydrogen, they expand into red giants, then shed their outer layers, and finally collapse into a white dwarf. White dwarfs are very dense and cool slowly over billions of years.\n\nMore massive stars have more dramatic endings. They can become neutron stars or even black holes after a supernova explosion. A supernova is a massive explosion that occurs at the end of some stars' lives, dispersing elements like oxygen, carbon, and iron into space.\n\nSo, to address the options:\n\nA) All stars start their life as black holes. This is incorrect. Black holes are usually the end result of very massive stars, not the starting point.\n\nB) Supernovae occur at the beginning of a star's life. Actually, supernovae typically occur at the end of a star's life, often after it has exhausted its nuclear fuel.\n\nC) Stars transform from nebulae straight into black holes. Again, this is not accurate. Only the most massive stars will eventually become black holes, and they go through several stages before reaching that point.\n\nD) The lifecycle of stars does not involve nuclear fusion. This is false. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers stars and allows them to shine.\n\nE) Stars evolve through stages including nebulae, protostars, main sequence stars, and depending on their mass, end as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. This accurately summarizes the stellar lifecycle.\n\nSo, the correct choice is E. It's important to understand that stars have a complex lifecycle, and their final state depends largely on their mass. The study of stars and their evolution is a fundamental part of astronomy and helps us understand the universe better."
