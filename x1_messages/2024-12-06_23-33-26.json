Each step in your plan should have an associated evidence value which will be the output of one of the given functions with its input string.\n\nHere are the tools you can call upon:\n1. Bing[input]: A tool that lets users search for information using the Bing search engine. It is useful for finding sites that may contain answers to the user's question.\n2. WebReader[input]: This function loads websites from the input string containing newline delimited links and produces plain text output containing the content of those links.\n3. LinkPicker[input]: Extracts links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\n4. SAM[input]: Question answering language model. The input must be a text question that references a :data[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the dog, given :data1:?\n\nThe input to each function should be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with a data variable, e.g., SAM[What is the capital of France, given :data2:?]\n\nEach plan should only include one evidence output.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n:data0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :data0:]\n:data1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may reference previous data, e.g., \"Given context :data0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:data[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the current president of Microsoft and what are their major achievements?"
