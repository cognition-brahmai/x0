        "content": "So I've got this problem about an airline introducing new direct flights between two major cities. They're planning three daily round-trip flights, each with a capacity of 200 passengers, and the average ticket price is $300. To launch this new route, they need to purchase two new planes, each costing $100 million, and invest $50 million in airport infrastructure upgrades. I need to calculate the annual revenue generated by these flights, assuming an 80% passenger load factor and 365 days of operation. Also, I have to determine the payback period for the initial investment, considering fixed costs of $10 million annually.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a round-trip flight means. A round-trip flight typically means flying from city A to city B and back to city A, counting as one round trip. So, three daily round-trip flights mean that each day, there are three flights going from A to B and three returning from B to A.\n\nBut wait, actually, in aviation, a round trip is considered as one cycle from A to B and back to A, but in terms of passenger movement, it's two one-way flights. So, for passenger count, I need to consider both legs of the trip.\n\nGiven that, let's clarify:\n\n- Each round-trip flight consists of two one-way flights: A to B and B to A.\n\n- There are three round-trip flights daily, meaning six one-way flights daily.\n\n- Each one-way flight has a capacity of 200 passengers.\n\n- The average ticket price is $300.\n\n- Passenger load factor is 80%.\n\n- Operation is for 365 days a year.\n\n- Initial investment: two planes at $100 million each, plus $50 million for infrastructure, totaling $250 million.\n\n- Annual fixed costs: $10 million.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the annual revenue.\n\nTo do that, I need to find out the total number of passengers carried in a year and multiply that by the average ticket price.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of one-way flights per day:\n\nSince each round trip consists of two one-way flights, and there are three round trips daily:\n\nTotal one-way flights per day = 3 round-trips/day * 2 one-way flights per round-trip = 6 one-way flights/day.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of seats available per day:\n\nEach one-way flight has 200 seats, so:\n\nTotal seats per day = 6 one-way flights/day * 200 seats/flight = 1200 seats/day.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of seats available per year:\n\nAssuming 365 days of operation:\n\nTotal seats per year = 1200 seats/day * 365 days/year = 438,000 seats/year.\n\n4. Apply the passenger load factor:\n\nLoad factor is 80%, so the number of passengers per year is:\n\nPassengers per year = 438,000 seats/year * 80% = 350,400 passengers/year.\n\n5. Calculate the annual revenue:\n\nAverage ticket price is $300, so:\n\nAnnual revenue = 350,400 passengers/year * $300/passenger = $105,120,000/year.\n\nOkay, that's the annual revenue.\n\nNow, I need to determine the payback period for the initial investment, taking into account the annual fixed costs.\n\nFirst, let's understand what payback period means. It's the time it takes for the net cash inflow to recover the initial investment.\n\nSo, I need to find out how many years it will take for the revenue, minus the annual fixed costs, to cover the initial investment of $250 million.\n\nLet's calculate the annual net cash flow:\n\nAnnual net cash flow = Annual revenue - Annual fixed costs = $105,120,000 - $10,000,000 = $95,120,000/year.\n\nNow, payback period = Initial investment / Annual net cash flow = $250,000,000 / $95,120,000/year.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$250,000,000 / $95,120,000/year \u2248 2.628 years.\n\nSo, the payback period is approximately 2.63 years.\n\nBut maybe I should express it in years and months. 0.63 years is roughly 7.5 months.\n\nTherefore, the payback period is about 2 years and 7.5 months.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if this is correct. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it more precisely.\n\nEach year, the net cash flow is $95,120,000.\n\nAfter 2 years, the total net cash flow would be $95,120,000 * 2 = $190,240,000.\n\nThe remaining amount to recover is $250,000,000 - $190,240,000 = $59,760,000.\n\nAt the rate of $95,120,000 per year, the time to recover $59,760,000 is $59,760,000 / $95,120,000/year \u2248 0.628 years.\n\nConvert 0.628 years to months: 0.628 years * 12 months/year \u2248 7.53 months.\n\nSo, indeed, the payback period is approximately 2 years and 7.5 months.\n\nTherefore, the annual revenue generated by these flights is $105,120,000, and the payback period for the initial investment is about 2 years and 7.5 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ years and } 7.5 \\text{ months}} \\]"
