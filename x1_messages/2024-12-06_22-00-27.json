        "content": "So there's this problem here. Let's see. In a class of 40 students, 60% are female. Then, 10 more male students join the class, and we need to find out what percentage of the class will be female after that.\n\nAlright, first things first. I need to find out how many female students there are initially. Since 60% of the 40 students are female, I can calculate that by multiplying 40 by 60%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky sometimes. Let me make sure I do this right. 60% of 40 is 0.6 times 40, which is 24. So, there are 24 female students.\n\nNow, the total number of students initially is 40. If there are 24 females, then the number of male students must be 40 minus 24, which is 16. So, there are 16 male students.\n\nNext, 10 more male students join the class. So, the new number of male students will be 16 plus 10, which is 26.\n\nThe total number of students now will be the original 40 plus the 10 new males, which is 50.\n\nNow, the number of female students remains the same, which is 24, because only male students joined.\n\nWe need to find out what percentage of the new total class is female. So, it's the number of females divided by the total number of students, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, that's 24 divided by 50, times 100.\n\nLet me calculate that. 24 divided by 50 is 0.48. Multiply by 100 gives 48%.\n\nSo, after 10 more male students join, 48% of the class will be female.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 40 students, 60% female: 0.6 * 40 = 24 females.\n\nMales: 40 - 24 = 16.\n\nAdd 10 males: 16 + 10 = 26 males.\n\nTotal students now: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nPercentage female: (24 / 50) * 100 = 48%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it this way: initially, there are 24 females out of 40 students. Then, only males are added, so the number of females stays the same, but the total number of students increases.\n\nSo, the new percentage female should be lower than before, which makes sense because we're adding only males.\n\nOriginally, it was 60%, and now it's 48%, which is indeed lower.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see the change in the proportion of females.\n\nInitially, females were 24 out of 40.\n\nAfter adding 10 males, total students are 50, and females are still 24.\n\nSo, 24 out of 50 is indeed 48%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48\\%} \\]"
