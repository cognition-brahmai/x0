        "content": "The Dead Sea Scrolls were found in caves near the Dead Sea, which is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west. The Dead Sea is known for its high salt content, making it one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, and it's also famous for its low elevation, being the lowest point on Earth's surface. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the mid-20th century was a significant archaeological find, providing valuable insights into the history and religious practices of the region during the time of Jesus and beyond."
