        "content": "I'd be happy to help you classify those water purification methods into physical, chemical, and biological processes. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst up is filtration. Filtration is a physical process where water is passed through a filter to remove particles and impurities. The filter can be a screen, a membrane, or even a bed of sand or gravel. Essentially, it's separating solids from liquids based on size, so no chemical reactions are involved.\n\nNext is chlorination. This is a chemical process where chlorine is added to water to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. Chlorine reacts with these pathogens, breaking down their cell structures and rendering them harmless. So, it's definitely a chemical treatment.\n\nUV radiation is another method. This is also a physical process, believe it or not. UV light is used to disinfect water by damaging the DNA of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, preventing them from reproducing. No chemicals are added; it's all about the energy from the UV light.\n\nBoiling is a classic method. This is a physical process as well. When water is boiled, the heat kills bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens by denaturing their proteins. It's a straightforward way to make water safe to drink by using heat.\n\nSedimentation is the process where heavier particles in water settle at the bottom over time. This is a physical process driven by gravity. It doesn't involve any chemical reactions or biological activity; it's just allowing particles to settle out naturally.\n\nCoagulation and flocculation are related processes often used together. Coagulation involves adding chemicals called coagulants to water, which help to neutralize the charges of particles, allowing them to come together. Flocculation is the gentle mixing that helps these particles form larger clumps, or flocs, which can then be removed through settling or filtration. So, coagulation is a chemical process, and flocculation is more of a physical process, but they're often combined.\n\nDistillation is a physical process where water is heated to produce vapor, which is then condensed back into liquid form, leaving impurities behind. It's essentially purifying water by boiling it and collecting the steam, which is then cooled to turn back into water. No chemical reactions are involved; it's based on the differences in boiling points of water and contaminants.\n\nLastly, ozonation is similar to chlorination but uses ozone instead of chlorine. Ozone is a strong oxidizing agent that breaks down organic matter and kills microorganisms. It's a chemical process because it involves the reaction of ozone with contaminants in the water.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\n- Physical processes: filtration, UV radiation, boiling, sedimentation, flocculation, distillation.\n\n- Chemical processes: chlorination, coagulation, ozonation.\n\n- Biological processes: none in this list.\n\nI hope that helps clarify things for you!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l|l|l}\n\\text{Physical Processes} & \\text{Chemical Processes} & \\text{Biological Processes} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Filtration} & \\text{Chlorination} & \\text{None} \\\\\n\\text{UV Radiation} & \\text{Coagulation} & \\\\\n\\text{Boiling} & \\text{Ozonation} & \\\\\n\\text{Sedimentation} & & \\\\\n\\text{Flocculation} & & \\\\\n\\text{Distillation} & & \\\\\n\\end{array} } \\]"
