        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, and they have gold and silver coins. The problem gives me a few relationships between the number of coins they have.\n\nFirst, it says that Alice has twice as many gold coins as Bob. Let's denote the number of gold coins Alice has as A_g and the number of gold coins Bob has as B_g. So, A_g = 2 * B_g.\n\nNext, Bob has three times as many silver coins as Alice. Let's denote Alice's silver coins as A_s and Bob's silver coins as B_s. So, B_s = 3 * A_s.\n\nI'm also told that Alice has 12 silver coins, so A_s = 12. That means B_s = 3 * 12 = 36.\n\nNow, the total number of coins they have is equal. So, the total coins for Alice are A_g + A_s, and for Bob are B_g + B_s. Since their total coins are equal, A_g + A_s = B_g + B_s.\n\nWe know A_s = 12 and B_s = 36, so plugging in, we have A_g + 12 = B_g + 36.\n\nBut from the first relationship, A_g = 2 * B_g. So, substituting that in:\n\n2 * B_g + 12 = B_g + 36.\n\nNow, let's solve for B_g.\n\nSubtract B_g from both sides:\n\n2 * B_g - B_g + 12 = 36\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nB_g + 12 = 36\n\nNow, subtract 12 from both sides:\n\nB_g = 36 - 12\n\nB_g = 24\n\nSo, Bob has 24 gold coins.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf Bob has 24 gold coins, then Alice has twice that, so A_g = 2 * 24 = 48 gold coins.\n\nAlice has 12 silver coins, and Bob has 36 silver coins.\n\nTotal coins for Alice: 48 + 12 = 60\n\nTotal coins for Bob: 24 + 36 = 60\n\nYes, their total coins are equal.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
