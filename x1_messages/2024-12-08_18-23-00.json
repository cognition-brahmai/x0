        "content": "A Bode plot is a graphical representation of a linear, time-invariant system with frequency against magnitude and phase. It is commonly used in control systems engineering to analyze the stability and performance of a system. The magnitude plot shows the gain or attenuation of the system at different frequencies, while the phase plot shows the phase shift introduced by the system at those frequencies. Bode plots are useful for understanding the frequency response of a system and for designing controllers to achieve desired performance specifications."
