        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 seats in a movie theater, arranged in a grid with 10 rows and 10 columns, since each row has 10 seats and each column has 10 seats. So, it's a 10x10 grid.\n\nI need to find out how many ways to choose 2 adjacent seats. Adjacent probably means seats that are next to each other, either in the same row or in the same column.\n\nFirst, I should think about how many pairs of adjacent seats there are in the rows. Each row has 10 seats, so in one row, the number of adjacent pairs would be 9, because each pair consists of two consecutive seats. For example, seats 1 and 2, seats 2 and 3, up to seats 9 and 10. So, 9 pairs per row.\n\nSince there are 10 rows, the total number of adjacent pairs in rows would be 10 rows times 9 pairs per row, which is 90.\n\nNext, I need to consider the adjacent pairs in the columns. Each column has 10 seats, so similarly, in one column, the number of adjacent pairs would be 9, because each pair consists of two seats one above the other. For example, seats 1 and 11, seats 11 and 21, up to seats 91 and 101, but wait, the seats are numbered from 1 to 100, so seats 1 to 10 are row 1, seats 11 to 20 are row 2, and so on up to row 10.\n\nSo, in column 1, the seats are 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91. So, adjacent pairs would be (1,11), (11,21), (21,31), ..., (81,91), which is 9 pairs.\n\nSimilarly, each column has 9 adjacent pairs. With 10 columns, that would be 10 columns times 9 pairs per column, which is 90.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to choose 2 adjacent seats, I need to add the number of adjacent pairs in rows and in columns. So, 90 from rows plus 90 from columns equals 180.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that I'm not double-counting any pairs. Are there any pairs that are counted both in rows and in columns? No, because adjacent in rows are horizontal neighbors, and adjacent in columns are vertical neighbors. So, no overlap there.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if \"adjacent\" includes both horizontal and vertical neighbors or if there's a specific definition. Given the problem statement, it seems to include both horizontal and vertical adjacency, but not diagonal.\n\nAssuming that, then my calculation seems correct: 90 row pairs plus 90 column pairs equals 180 total ways to choose 2 adjacent seats.\n\nBut let me double-check. For rows: 10 rows * 9 pairs each = 90.\n\nFor columns: 10 columns * 9 pairs each = 90.\n\nTotal: 90 + 90 = 180.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as a grid and count the number of edges between seats. In a 10x10 grid, the number of horizontal edges is 10 rows * 9 edges per row = 90, and the number of vertical edges is 10 columns * 9 edges per column = 90, totaling 180 edges, which correspond to adjacent seat pairs.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 180.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
