        "content": "So, I've got this scenario here: a doctor gives me three pills and tells me to take one every half hour. I need to figure out how long these pills will last. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"take one every half hour\" means. Does that mean I take a pill and then wait half an hour before taking the next one, or is there a different timing involved?\n\nLet me think about it. If I take the first pill at time zero, then the second pill at half an hour, and the third pill at one hour, that means the entire duration from the first pill to the last pill is one hour.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me visualize it:\n\n- Time 0: Take pill 1\n\n- Time 0.5 hours: Take pill 2\n\n- Time 1 hour: Take pill 3\n\nSo, from the first pill to the last pill, it's a one-hour period. But does \"every half hour\" mean something else?\n\nMaybe I should consider the interval between pills. The interval is half an hour between each pill. So, with three pills, there are two intervals between them.\n\nInterval 1: between pill 1 and pill 2 = 0.5 hours\n\nInterval 2: between pill 2 and pill 3 = 0.5 hours\n\nTotal time = interval 1 + interval 2 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 hour\n\nYes, that seems consistent with my earlier thought.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in scheduling tasks, the timing can be interpreted differently. For example, maybe the doctor meant to take a pill every half hour starting from the first pill, but including the time when the first pill is taken.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Time 0: Take pill 1\n\n- Time 0.5 hours: Take pill 2\n\n- Time 1 hour: Take pill 3\n\nStill, the total time is one hour.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the time from the first pill to after the last pill is taken. So, if I take the first pill at time zero and the last pill at one hour, the pills last for one hour.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe the doctor wants me to take a pill every half hour, but starting at different times.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If I take one pill every half hour, and I have three pills, how much time passes between the first and the last pill?\n\nAgain, it's two intervals of half an hour each, so total time is one hour.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of a sequence:\n\n- Pill 1 at time t=0\n\n- Pill 2 at t=0.5 hours\n\n- Pill 3 at t=1 hour\n\nSo, the last pill is taken at t=1 hour.\n\nTherefore, the pills last for one hour in total.\n\nBut wait, does \"how long would the pills last\" refer to the duration of the effect of the pills, or just the timing of taking them?\n\nThe question seems to be about the timing of taking the pills, not necessarily how long their effects last. So, I should focus on the timing of ingestion.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the time between the first and the last pill.\n\nTime between first and last pill = time of last pill - time of first pill = 1 hour - 0 hours = 1 hour\n\nTherefore, the pills last for one hour in terms of the timing of taking them.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each pill is taken every half hour, and there are three pills, then the total time is the number of intervals between pills times the interval duration.\n\nNumber of intervals = number of pills - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nInterval duration = 0.5 hours\n\nTotal time = 2 * 0.5 hours = 1 hour\n\nThis matches my previous conclusion.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose the doctor says \"take one every half hour.\" Maybe this means that after taking the first pill, wait half an hour and take the second, then wait another half hour and take the third.\n\nAgain, that leads to the same conclusion: total time is one hour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the doctor means to take a pill at time zero, then at time 0.5 hours, and then at time 1 hour.\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nI think I've considered all possible interpretations, and they all point to the same answer: the pills last for one hour in terms of the timing of taking them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is one hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]"
