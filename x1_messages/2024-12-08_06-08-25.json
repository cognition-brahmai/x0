        "content": "To address the user's request to \"count the number of rows where the 'status' column has the value 'active'\", I need to select the most appropriate function from the available options. The available functions are `csv_analytics`, `search`, and `data_sorting`. \n\nFirst, let's understand what each function does:\n\n1. **csv_analytics**:\n   - Description: Performs various aggregations and counts from CSV data.\n   - Parameters:\n     - action: The action to perform, such as \"count\", \"filter\", \"grouped_count\", etc.\n     - filters:\n       - column: The column to filter on.\n       - value: Explicit value to filter on.\n       - expression: Expression value to filter on.\n\n2. **search**:\n   - Description: Helps users find information by converting the input query into search terms and filters.\n   - Parameters:\n     - search_terms: List of keywords and/or phrases important to the input.\n     - alternatives: List of alternative keywords and/or phrases.\n     - date_range:\n       - begin: Limit results to items with date >= this value.\n       - end: Limit results to items with date <= this value.\n\n3. **data_sorting**:\n   - Description: Useful for sorting data according to specified criteria.\n   - Parameters:\n     - sort_by: The column to sort by.\n     - order: Order of sorting (ascending or descending).\n\nGiven the user's request, they want to count rows based on a specific condition in the 'status' column. This sounds like a filtering and counting operation, which is directly supported by the `csv_analytics` function.\n\nLet's break down the user's request:\n\n- Action: Count rows.\n- Condition: 'status' column has the value 'active'.\n\nSo, using `csv_analytics`, we can set:\n\n- action: \"count\"\n- filters:\n  - column: \"status\"\n  - value: \"active\"\n\nThe `search` function seems more geared towards searching for information using keywords and possibly date ranges, which doesn't directly align with the user's request to count rows based on a column value.\n\nThe `data_sorting` function is for sorting data, which again doesn't meet the user's need for counting specific rows.\n\nTherefore, `csv_analytics` is the most suitable function for this task.\n\nNow, I need to format this in JSON according to the required structure.\n\n**Final Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"csv_analytics\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"action\": \"count\",\n    \"filters\": {\n      \"column\": \"status\",\n      \"value\": \"active\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"
