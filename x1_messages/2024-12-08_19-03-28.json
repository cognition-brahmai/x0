This function is designed for performing operations on text data, such as counting words and finding word frequencies, which directly aligns with the user's requirement.\n\nTo accomplish this task, we need to specify the appropriate parameters for the `text_analytics` function. The user wants to count the occurrences of a specific word, \"robotics\", which corresponds to the \"find_frequency\" action in the function's parameters.\n\nHere's how we can structure the function call in YAML format:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: text_analytics\nparams:\n  action: find_frequency\n  filters:\n    word: robotics\n```\n\nThis configuration instructs the `text_analytics` function to perform the \"find_frequency\" action, focusing on the word \"robotics\" within the provided text file. This should effectively count how many times \"robotics\" appears in the file, fulfilling the user's request."
