        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a man who earns $20 for every hour he works. He works 8 hours each day. We need to find out how much he earns in a week.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many days are in a week. Typically, a week has 7 days. So, if he works 8 hours each day for 7 days, that would be:\n\n8 hours/day \u00d7 7 days = 56 hours in a week.\n\nNow, since he earns $20 per hour, his total earnings for the week would be:\n\n56 hours \u00d7 $20/hour = $1120.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate his daily earnings first and then multiply by the number of days in a week.\n\nSo, daily earnings:\n\n8 hours/day \u00d7 $20/hour = $160/day.\n\nThen, weekly earnings:\n\n$160/day \u00d7 7 days = $1120.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it seems like $1120 is the correct amount he earns in a week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, is there overtime? Does he work every day of the week? The problem says he works 8 hours a day, and doesn't mention any overtime or holidays, so I'll assume it's a standard workweek.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the week is a regular 7-day week or if it's a different type of workweek. But since no specifics are given, I'll go with the standard 7-day week.\n\nSo, in conclusion, he earns $1120 in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1120} \\]"
