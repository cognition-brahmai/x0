        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a city with a population of 500,000 people, 60% of the population own a car. I need to find out how many people that actually is. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what percentage means. Percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. So, 60% means 60 per 100, or in decimal form, 0.60.\n\nNow, to find out how many people own a car, I need to calculate 60% of the total population, which is 500,000 people.\n\nThe formula for this is:\n\nNumber of car owners = (percentage owning a car / 100) \u00d7 total population\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of car owners = (60 / 100) \u00d7 500,000\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\n60 / 100 = 0.60\n\nSo,\n\nNumber of car owners = 0.60 \u00d7 500,000\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 500,000 = 300,000\n\nTherefore, 300,000 people in the city own a car.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf 60% own a car, then the number should be less than the total population but significant. 300,000 out of 500,000 is indeed 60%, so that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of fractions. 60% is the same as 3/5 (since 60 divided by 100 is 3/5).\n\nSo, 3/5 of 500,000 would be:\n\n(3/5) \u00d7 500,000 = 3 \u00d7 (500,000 / 5) = 3 \u00d7 100,000 = 300,000\n\nSame answer. Good, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that half of the population would be 50%, which is 250,000 people (since 50% of 500,000 is 250,000). But here, it's 60%, which is 10% more than 50%. So, 10% of 500,000 is 50,000 (because 10% of 500,000 is 50,000). Adding that to the 250,000 gives 300,000 again.\n\nAlright, no matter which way I approach it, I keep getting 300,000. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any possibility that the percentage could be applied differently, maybe considering households instead of individuals? But the question specifically says \"population,\" so it's referring to individuals.\n\nAlso, it doesn't mention anything about multiple cars per person or anything like that, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 300,000 people in the city own a car.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300000} \\]"
