        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 200 units of product A and 300 units of product B in one day. Each unit of product A takes 4 hours to produce, and each unit of product B takes 6 hours. I need to find out the total hours spent producing both products in a day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total hours spent on product A. Since each unit of product A takes 4 hours, and they produce 200 units, I can multiply 200 by 4.\n\n200 units * 4 hours/unit = 800 hours\n\nThat's for product A.\n\nNow, for product B, each unit takes 6 hours, and they produce 300 units. So, 300 units * 6 hours/unit = 1800 hours\n\nThat's for product B.\n\nTo find the total hours spent on both products, I need to add the hours for product A and product B together.\n\n800 hours + 1800 hours = 2600 hours\n\nSo, the total hours spent producing both products in a day is 2600 hours.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing? Let's double-check.\n\nThe factory produces 200 units of A and 300 units of B in one day. Product A takes 4 hours per unit, product B takes 6 hours per unit. Multiplying the units by their respective production times and then adding them up should give the total hours.\n\n200 * 4 = 800 hours\n\n300 * 6 = 1800 hours\n\n800 + 1800 = 2600 hours\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total production time per unit for both products and then sum them up. But that seems like it would be more complicated for this problem. The method I used appears to be the most straightforward.\n\nI don't think there's any need for additional calculations or considerations here. The question is pretty straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2600} \\]"
