        "content": "So, if a car gets 25 miles per gallon and has a 12-gallon gas tank, how many miles can it travel on a full tank? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"miles per gallon\" means. It's a measure of fuel efficiency, right? So, 25 miles per gallon means that for every gallon of gas, the car can travel 25 miles.\n\nNow, if the car has a 12-gallon gas tank, that means it can hold 12 gallons of gas at once. So, if I want to know how many miles it can travel on a full tank, I need to calculate how far it can go with all 12 gallons.\n\nTo do that, I think I should multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank. So, 25 miles per gallon times 12 gallons.\n\nLet me write that down: 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons.\n\nHmm, when I multiply those, the \"gallons\" unit should cancel out, leaving me with miles. That makes sense because I'm trying to find out the total miles it can travel on a full tank.\n\nSo, 25 * 12 equals 300. Therefore, the car can travel 300 miles on a full tank.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the car doesn't use gas perfectly efficiently all the time. For example, if the car is driven at high speeds, it might use more gas than usual. Or if it's carrying heavy loads, that could affect fuel efficiency too.\n\nAlso, the condition of the car's engine and tires can impact fuel efficiency. If the engine is not tuned properly or if the tires are underinflated, the car might not get the advertised 25 miles per gallon.\n\nMoreover, driving conditions like traffic, road grade, and weather can affect how much gas the car uses. For instance, stopping and starting in traffic burns more gas than cruising on a highway.\n\nSo, while the calculation gives me 300 miles, in real-world driving, the actual distance might be less due to these factors.\n\nBut based on the information provided, which assumes ideal conditions, the car can travel 300 miles on a full tank.\n\nMaybe I should also consider the precision of the numbers given. 25 miles per gallon and 12 gallons are both whole numbers, so perhaps the answer should be given as a whole number as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 12-gallon tank isn't completely fillable to the brim, and there's some unusable space in the tank. But I think for this problem, we can assume that the entire 12 gallons are usable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the accuracy of the car's fuel gauge. If the gauge isn't perfectly accurate, the driver might not know exactly when the tank is full, which could affect the actual distance traveled.\n\nBut again, for this calculation, I'll assume that the tank is fully filled to its 12-gallon capacity.\n\nSo, in conclusion, multiplying the miles per gallon by the tank size in gallons gives the total miles\u53ef\u884c\u9a76 on a full tank. Therefore, 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward. But it's always good to remember that real-world mileage may vary based on various factors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
