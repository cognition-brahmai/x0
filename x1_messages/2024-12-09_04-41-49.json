        "content": "Let's solve the equation 3x - 7 = 5x + 1 step by step.\n\nFirst, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. To do that, I can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to eliminate the x term on the left side.\n\nSo, subtracting 3x from both sides:\n\n3x - 7 - 3x = 5x + 1 - 3x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-7 = 2x + 1\n\nNow, I want to isolate the x term. I can do this by subtracting 1 from both sides:\n\n-7 - 1 = 2x + 1 - 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-8 = 2x\n\nNow, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 2:\n\n-8 / 2 = 2x / 2\n\nThis gives:\n\n-4 = x\n\nSo, the solution is x = -4.\n\nTo make sure this is correct, I can plug x = -4 back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x - 7 = 5x + 1\n\nPlugging in x = -4:\n\n3*(-4) - 7 = 5*(-4) + 1\n\n-12 - 7 = -20 + 1\n\n-19 = -19\n\nSince both sides are equal, x = -4 is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-4} \\]"
