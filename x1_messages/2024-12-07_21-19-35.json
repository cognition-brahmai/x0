        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 mph and comes back at 40 mph. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between Town A and Town B is D miles. That means the total distance for the round trip is 2D miles.\n\nNow, the time taken to go from A to B at 60 mph is D divided by 60, which is D/60 hours.\n\nThe time taken to come back from B to A at 40 mph is D divided by 40, which is D/40 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is D/60 + D/40 hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.\n\nSo, D/60 = (2D)/120 and D/40 = (3D)/120.\n\nAdding them up: (2D + 3D)/120 = 5D/120 = D/24 hours.\n\nNow, the average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 2D divided by D/24.\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 2D * 24/D.\n\nThe D's cancel out, and we get 2 * 24 = 48 mph.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this?\n\nI recall that for round trips with different speeds, the average speed is not just the arithmetic mean of the two speeds. In this case, it's 60 mph and 40 mph, so the arithmetic mean would be (60 + 40)/2 = 50 mph, but that's not what we got.\n\nNo, the correct way is to use the harmonic mean for speeds over the same distance. The formula for the average speed for a round trip is twice the product of the speeds divided by the sum of the speeds.\n\nSo, average speed = 2 * (60 * 40) / (60 + 40) = 2 * 2400 / 100 = 4800 / 100 = 48 mph.\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If the train goes faster one way and slower the other, the average should be somewhere in between. 48 mph is between 40 and 60, closer to 40 because it spent more time at the slower speed.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire round trip is 48 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
