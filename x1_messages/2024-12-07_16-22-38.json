        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Java program that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. This program will prompt the user to enter a number and then compute its factorial using a recursive function.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class FactorialRecursion {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \");\n        int number = scanner.nextInt();\n        if (number < 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\");\n        } else {\n            long factorial = factorial(number);\n            System.out.println(\"The factorial of \" + number + \" is \" + factorial);\n        }\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorial(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - The program uses `Scanner` to read input from the user.\n   - It prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n\n2. **Factorial Calculation**:\n   - The `factorial` method is defined recursively:\n     - Base case: If `n` is 0, the factorial is 1.\n     - Recursive case: The factorial of `n` is `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - If the user enters a negative number, the program informs them that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The result is displayed showing the factorial of the entered number.\n\nTo run this program, ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Save the code in a file named `FactorialRecursion.java`, then compile and run it using the following commands in your terminal:\n\n```sh\njavac FactorialRecursion.java\njava FactorialRecursion\n```\n\nThis will execute the program, allowing you to input a number and see its factorial calculated using recursion."
