        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a room, every person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, and there are a total of 66 handshakes. I need to figure out how many people are in the room. Hmm, interesting. Let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that this kind of problem is related to combinations. You know, like how many ways can you choose pairs from a group of people. Since each handshake is between two people and every pair shakes hands exactly once, it's similar to finding the number of unique pairs in the group.\n\nSo, if there are n people in the room, the number of handshakes would be the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n, which is denoted as C(n, 2), or \"n choose 2\". The formula for C(n, 2) is n(n-1)/2. So, according to the problem, n(n-1)/2 = 66.\n\nAlright, so I have the equation n(n-1)/2 = 66. I need to solve for n. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn(n-1) = 132.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0.\n\nI can try to solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: n = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 528)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 \u221a529] / 2.\n\n\u221a529 is 23, so n = [1 \u00b1 23]/2.\n\nThat gives me two potential solutions: n = (1 + 23)/2 = 12, and n = (1 - 23)/2 = -11.\n\nWell, negative numbers of people don't make sense, so n = 12 is the only feasible solution.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. If there are 12 people, the number of handshakes would be C(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 66. That matches the given number. Good.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using sequences or something else?\n\nLet's think about it differently. The first person shakes hands with 11 other people. The second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 10 remaining people. The third shakes hands with 9, and so on, until the last person, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be 11 + 10 + 9 + ... + 1.\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term a1 = 11, the last term an = 1, and the number of terms is 11.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a1 + an).\n\nSo, S = 11/2 * (11 + 1) = 11/2 * 12 = 11 * 6 = 66.\n\nAgain, this matches the given number of handshakes.\n\nNow, to find the number of people, n, I notice that the number of handshakes is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers.\n\nSo, sum = (n-1)n/2 = 66.\n\nWait, that's the same equation as before: n(n-1)/2 = 66.\n\nSo, I end up with the same quadratic equation and the same solution, n = 12.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nPerhaps using permutations instead of combinations. But no, because the order doesn't matter in a handshake; shaking hands is a mutual action.\n\nWait, but if I consider ordered pairs, like person A shakes hands with person B, and person B shakes hands with person A, that would be counting each handshake twice.\n\nSo, if I were to use permutations, it would be P(n, 2) = n(n-1), but then I would need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting, which brings me back to C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, again, the same equation.\n\nLet me consider if there's a way to solve this without solving a quadratic equation.\n\nI know that C(n, 2) = 66.\n\nI could try plugging in different values of n to see which one gives 66.\n\nLet's try n = 10: C(10, 2) = 10*9/2 = 45. Too low.\n\nn = 11: C(11, 2) = 11*10/2 = 55. Still less than 66.\n\nn = 12: C(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 66. Perfect.\n\nSo, n = 12 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, n = 13: C(13, 2) = 13*12/2 = 78, which is more than 66.\n\nSo, 12 is indeed the correct number.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other integer n that could satisfy n(n-1)/2 = 66?\n\nWell, n = 12 works, and n = -11 doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAre there any fractional solutions?\n\nLet's see, suppose n is not an integer.\n\nLet\u2019s say n is between 11 and 12.\n\nFor example, n = 11.5.\n\nThen, C(11.5, 2) = 11.5*10.5/2 = (11.5*10.5)/2 = 120.75/2 = 60.375. That's less than 66.\n\nn = 12 gives exactly 66.\n\nn = 12.5: C(12.5, 2) = 12.5*11.5/2 = 143.75/2 = 71.875, which is more than 66.\n\nSo, no fractional number of people would give exactly 66 handshakes; only n = 12 does.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the handshake graph, where each person is a vertex and each handshake is an edge.\n\nIn graph theory, the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, again, n(n-1)/2 = 66.\n\nSolving for n gives n\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0, leading to n = 12.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways: through combinations, arithmetic series, and graph theory.\n\nIs there any other approach I can take to verify this?\n\nPerhaps using the concept of triangular numbers.\n\nTriangular numbers are sums of the first n natural numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2.\n\nBut in this problem, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, 66 is a triangular number, and I need to find n such that the (n-1)th triangular number is 66.\n\nLooking up triangular numbers, the 11th triangular number is 66, since 11*12/2 = 66.\n\nBut wait, if it's the 11th triangular number, then n-1 = 11, so n = 12.\n\nAgain, n = 12.\n\nAlternatively, I can list out the triangular numbers:\n\n1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66,...\n\nSo, the 11th triangular number is 66, corresponding to n-1 = 11, hence n = 12.\n\nConsistent with previous methods.\n\nLet me consider if there's a way this could be misinterpreted.\n\nFor example, what if some people don't shake hands with certain others? But the problem says every person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, so no exceptions.\n\nAlternatively, what if there are people who don't shake hands with anyone, but that would contradict \"every person shakes hands with every other person.\"\n\nSo, no, all people must participate in handshakes.\n\nAnother potential misunderstanding: multiple handshakes between the same pair.\n\nBut the problem specifies exactly once, so only one handshake per pair.\n\nAlso, no\u63e1\u624bwith oneself, which is standard in these problems.\n\nI think the assumption that it's a simple handshake where each pair shakes hands exactly once is correct.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that n = 12 is solid.\n\nTo summarize, using combinations, arithmetic series, quadratic equations, and triangular numbers, I've arrived at the same answer: there are 12 people in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
