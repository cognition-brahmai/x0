        "content": "So the hotel is planning to have 200 rooms, each being 300 square feet. Plus, there are common areas that take up 40% of the total building area. The building has four floors and is assumed to have a square floor plan. I need to find the total area of the hotel and then figure out the approximate dimensions of the building.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total area occupied by the rooms. Since there are 200 rooms and each is 300 square feet:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total room area} = 200 \\times 300 = 60,000 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nNow, the common areas occupy 40% of the total building area. Let's denote the total building area as \\( T \\). The room area is 60,000 square feet, which is 60% of the total area because common areas take up 40%. So:\n\n\\[ 60\\% \\text{ of } T = 60,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.6T = 60,000 \\]\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{60,000}{0.6} = 100,000 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nSo, the total area of the hotel is 100,000 square feet.\n\nNext, I need to determine the approximate dimensions of the building, assuming it has a square floor plan and four floors.\n\nFirst, since the building has four floors, the area per floor would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area per floor} = \\frac{100,000}{4} = 25,000 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nGiven that the floor plan is square, let\u2019s find the length of one side of the square. Let \\( s \\) be the length of one side:\n\n\\[ s^2 = 25,000 \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{25,000} \\]\n\n\\[ s \\approx 158.11 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSo, each floor is approximately a square with sides of about 158.11 feet.\n\nBut, to find the overall dimensions of the building, considering it has four floors, we need to consider the height as well. However, the question asks for the approximate dimensions of the building, assuming a square floor plan, which suggests that the width and depth are equal, and the height is determined by the number of floors.\n\nIf we consider the building to be a square prism, with each floor being a square of side \\( s \\), and there are four floors, then the overall dimensions would be:\n\n- Width: \\( s \\) feet\n\n- Depth: \\( s \\) feet\n\n- Height: \\( h \\) feet per floor times 4 floors\n\nBut, typically, the height per floor can vary based on the design and\u7528\u9014. For simplicity, if we assume an average ceiling height per floor, say 10 feet, then the total height would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total height} = 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the approximate dimensions of the building would be:\n\n- Width: 158.11 feet\n\n- Depth: 158.11 feet\n\n- Height: 40 feet\n\nHowever, building heights can vary, so this is just an estimation based on the assumption of 10-foot ceiling heights per floor.\n\nAlternatively, if we only consider the base dimensions and not the height, since the question mentions \"approximate dimensions of the building\" assuming a square floor plan, it might be referring only to the width and depth.\n\nIn that case, the building would have a base of approximately 158.11 feet by 158.11 feet, with four floors.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in real-world scenarios, buildings have additional areas for stairs, elevators, mechanical spaces, and other features that aren't accounted for in this simplified calculation. But based on the information provided, this should give a reasonable estimate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100,000 \\text{ square feet}, \\text{ with approximate dimensions } 158.11 \\text{ feet} \\times 158.11 \\text{ feet} \\times 40 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
