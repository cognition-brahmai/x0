        "content": "So I need to calculate the total cost of buying some notebooks and pens. Specifically, it's 10 notebooks each costing $2, and 5 pens each costing $1. I need to figure out the total amount I'd have to pay for all these items. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost of the notebooks. Since each notebook costs $2 and I'm buying 10 of them, I need to multiply the price per notebook by the number of notebooks. So, that's $2 multiplied by 10. Let me do that calculation:\n\n$2 \u00d7 10 = $20\n\nSo, the total cost for the notebooks is $20.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost of the pens. Each pen costs $1, and I'm buying 5 pens. Again, I'll multiply the price per pen by the number of pens:\n\n$1 \u00d7 5 = $5\n\nSo, the total cost for the pens is $5.\n\nNow, to find the total cost of both the notebooks and the pens, I need to add the two amounts together:\n\n$20 (notebooks) + $5 (pens) = $25\n\nTherefore, the total cost for buying 10 notebooks and 5 pens is $25.\n\nJust to double-check, let me verify these calculations. First, 10 notebooks at $2 each:\n\n10 \u00d7 $2 = $20 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 5 pens at $1 each:\n\n5 \u00d7 $1 = $5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAdding them up:\n\n$20 + $5 = $25 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident that $25 is the correct total cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
