        "content": "Let's see. The store sells bags of candy for $12 each, and during the sale, they offer a 20% discount on each bag. I need to find out how much 7 bags will cost during the sale.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the discount amount is per bag. If each bag is $12 and there's a 20% discount, I need to calculate 20% of $12.\n\nTo calculate 20% of $12, I can multiply 12 by 0.20 because 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 12 times 0.20 is 2.4. That means the discount per bag is $2.40.\n\nNow, to find the sale price per bag, I need to subtract the discount from the original price.\n\nSo, $12 minus $2.40 is $9.60. Therefore, each bag costs $9.60 during the sale.\n\nNow, I need to find out the cost of 7 bags at $9.60 each.\n\nTo do that, I multiply 7 by $9.60.\n\nLet me calculate that. 7 times 9.60.\n\nFirst, 7 times 9 is 63, and 7 times 0.60 is 4.20. So, 63 plus 4.20 is 67.20.\n\nTherefore, 7 bags will cost $67.20 during the sale.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could have calculated the sale price differently. Since there's a 20% discount, that means the customer pays 80% of the original price.\n\nBecause 100% minus 20% is 80%.\n\nSo, 80% of $12 is the sale price per bag.\n\nTo find 80% of 12, I can multiply 12 by 0.80.\n\n12 times 0.80 is 9.60, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the sale price per bag is indeed $9.60.\n\nThen, 7 bags at $9.60 each would be 7 times 9.60, which is $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, I could have calculated the total original price for 7 bags and then applied the discount.\n\nLet me try that method to confirm.\n\nFirst, the total original price for 7 bags at $12 each is 7 times 12, which is $84.\n\nThen, the discount is 20% off, so I need to find 20% of $84.\n\n20% of 84 is 0.20 times 84, which is 16.80.\n\nSo, the discount is $16.80.\n\nSubtracting the discount from the original total: $84 minus $16.80 is $67.20.\n\nAgain, I get $67.20 as the total cost for 7 bags during the sale.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a 20% discount, the customer pays 80% of the original total.\n\nSo, 80% of $84 is 0.80 times 84, which is also $67.20.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same answer, so I'm confident that $67.20 is the correct total cost for 7 bags during the sale.\n\nLet me just make sure about the decimal places.\n\n$9.60 per bag times 7 is $67.20.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of moving decimals, 7 times 9 is 63, and 7 times 0.6 is 4.2, so 63 plus 4.2 is indeed 67.2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $67.20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{67.20} \\]"
