Web surfers have spurned those all- too familiar banners and links. RAMIN MARZBANI, CEO, A.C. NIELSEN CONSULT.: Just because they click on an ad doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re attracting with it or they\\'re interested in the product. PEK: That\\'s left advertisers scrambling to find new, more creative campaigns guaranteed to catch your eye. KENT WERTIME, CEO, OGLIVEY INTERACTIVE: More and more banners are going to be like TV commercials. They\\'re going to have much more interesting concepts. PEK: So what are marketeers and advertisers doing these days? Find out on this edition of E-BIZ ASIA. Hello and welcome to E-BIZ ASIA. I\\'m Lian Pek. Advertisers and marketeers have been hit hard by the bursting of the tech bubble and the global economic slowdown. Gone are the days when dot-coms could afford to spend millions in edgy TV ads and big magazine spreads. And both new and old economy companies alike are in belt tightening mode, scaling back their costly campaigns. Although online marketeers pitch the Web as a way to get more bang for the buck, fewer and fewer seem convinced that digital marketing is effective. But according to one entertainment group, Web promoting doesn\\'t need to be a sheer waste of cash, so long as you have a few tricks up your sleeve. PEK (voice-over): Even the world\\'s best-known magician has to keep up with the times. For David Copperfield, that means latching onto the Internet. That\\'s the theme of his latest show, \"Portal,\" currently making the rounds in Asia, but also a crucial way of putting bums on seats. DALE RENNGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, AEC LTD.: David\\'s very much into IT. We love IT. So our entire campaign was like built around how are we going to do this? How are we going to really use the Internet to get to people? PEK: And the Web did get to people. Videomail sent us some 5,000 VIPs and a dedicated Copperfield Web site did the trick. AEC, the show\\'s promoters, sold nearly a third of their tickets online in both Hong Kong and Singapore. More than the measly 5 percent they were expecting. Decent enough results to make the worst critics of Web advertising think again. RENNGER: I think that there are existing businesses now like ticketing, which are perfectly suited for the Internet platform. However, I do disagree with many pundits out there that say that all our product cannot be sold over the Internet. I think you have to get really deep. You have to really analyze what is the product, what are the traditional methods of a client buying your product? Not just \"let\\'s put a banner ad here and if don\\'t get any click-throughs, it ain\\'t working.\" PEK: Ramin Marzbani from Internet research company, A.C. Nielsen Consult, couldn\\'t agree more. Looking at six Hong Kong case studies recently, he found that for every 1,000 consumers exposed to an online ad, 82 more people remembered the ad. Better yet, 18 more expressed an intention to buy the advertised brand. Marzbani says this goes to show that the advertising industry should stop obsessing about click through rates and the fact that they\\'ve fallen through the floor. MARZBANI: You need someone to click on an ad doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re interacting with it or they\\'re interested in the product. And especially if you\\'re interested in brand effectiveness, you absolutely have to drop the click here. PEK: And though the dot-com crash has put a definite strain on those in the online ad business, their may be hope yet. Savvy marketeers who\\'ve hung in there are beginning to see results. MARZBANI: Are we seeing anyone who is spending, for example, less than 2,000 U.S. per month? Absolutely exit the market because it doesn\\'t work. It\\'s a little bit like going to a TV station and buying $2,000 a month of advertising. Or you could stay awake until 3:00 in the morning and see your ad, but it\\'s probably not going to have a big impact on your business. The banks and financial services companies who have been spending the most have actually stayed with online advertising. And they\\'re not getting more and more value, more and more page impressions for the same budgets they have last year. So they don\\'t really need to expand their budgets. PEK: The David Copperfield Show is another case in point. In fact, more than keeping a cap on budgets, the show\\'s promoters are saving 30 percent in advertising and promotions over his previous tour in \\'98. And all thanks to the Internet, which appears to be offering more value for money over traditional TV and print ads. No surprise going forward, more than a third of their budget will go to the Net from the current one-fifth. RENNGER: There has to be a mix of the above the line traditional advertising with the Internet. The two have to work together because one is Goliath. The other one is David. But I do definitely see David very much catching up with Goliath. PEK: If only everybody had that magic touch. Truth is, many companies have found initial efforts to advertise on the Web ineffective, but is it wise to give up on the Net altogether? I sat down with Kent Wertime, the regional CEO of Oglivy Interactive and asked him just that. WERTIME: The Net is definitely not dead. The Net is changing. People realize after the dot-com bubble that really the space is about marketing. It\\'s not simply about transacting. So we\\'re seeing a lot of clients interested more and more in the Net because more people on the Net every day, more than last year. PEK: And so, let\\'s not forget the fact that there is growing online audience which the advertisers cannot forget about. WERTIME: Definitely, definitely. PEK: Well, among the experiments now, we know that people have come up with alternatives to the banner ads. Sort of seven new sort of formats for Internet ads. How well have those actually gone down? WERTIME: They\\'re doing that well, but we have to remember that in advertising in general, you have to balance out intrusiveness versus annoyance. So the sizes are bigger, the more intrusive they work better. But the annoyance factor with consumers can be larger. So there\\'s always got to be a balance there. PEK: So i.e., they\\'re not actually doing all that well? I mean, that\\'s another experiment, sort of sung by a lot of people in the industry? WERTIME: Well, it\\'s not just size. That\\'s the issue here. Really, it\\'s media richness. It\\'s about how much content you actually deliver to a banner. In the future, more and more banners are going to be like TV commercials. They\\'re going to have much more interesting content. And that\\'s where I think the whole online ad industry\\'s really going to begin to take off even more. PEK: Now you said earlier, of course, that people have to move beyond sort of marketing and thinking about sort of transactions and that sort of thing? They have to move beyond making the sales pitch? WERTIME: Well, they have to build a relationship. I mean, the Internet now is a great area for customer relationship management. It\\'s a great place to be out there educating consumers. It\\'s not about just flogging goods online cheaper. It\\'s about building brands. PEK: I.e. you will have to be offering sort of Internet information services? For instance, I mean, sort of like Web sites selling moisturizing creams will have to give information on how to take care of your skin, skin care and that sort of thing? WERTIME: Exactly. That\\'s what they\\'re doing today because a 30 second commercial, even if you love the commercial, it\\'s over after 30 seconds. Well, Web site, if it\\'s compelling, you can spend 20 minutes on it. You can spend two hours on it, if there\\'s enough content there to hold the consumer\\'s interest. So it\\'s an amazing place to be marketing because you can build this compelling relationship, if you know how to do it. PEK: And how else does one actually make the relationship more compelling? I mean, are we seeing here more a sense of people going across platforms, as well, apart from the traditional, sort of, TV and print ads? They\\'re going into a sort of Internet ads? They\\'re going to streaming? WERTIME: Absolutely. What we\\'re seeing is more and more companies are looking at e-commercials because e-commercials allow you not only to show a traditional commercial, but add interactivity to it. Assuming more and more happening in the wireless front, particularly with SMS and also of course in places like Japan with I-mode. So there are more and more platforms. Of course, the PDA as well. So we\\'re going to see over the next couple of years a real profusion of advertising on a number of different platforms, all of which have to integrate, because let\\'s not forget a brand has to be consistent. So we will be integrating these messages across the platform. PEK: Right, with this sort of integration, do you think it\\'s going to be more expensive for the companies, for the people wanting to market things? I mean, if they have to carve out their sort of ad budgets, you know, to include the various platforms, what does it mean for them in terms of spending? WERTIME: These are going to have re-look at how they\\'re allocating money, but the issue isn\\'t just cost. It\\'s return on investment. So they do areas people are interested in because they see that they\\'re exciting for consumers. They add new value if done properly. And that they can add new benefit to the brand. So the cost isn\\'t the issue, it\\'s the return that\\'s the real question. PEK: Fundamentally, I suppose, the best way to reach the customer right now is to follow them everywhere, to make sure you have all your bases covered? WERTIME: As long as you help them. You don\\'t want to haunt them, particularly on the hand phone, which is a much more personal item, say than a traditional desktop. You need to be able to communicate in a way that they want, which means not invading their lives, but helping them. PEK: Hollywood\\'s had some success generating buzz about this summer\\'s blockbusters, but it seems promoting your flick on the Net takes coming up with a plot almost as intricate as the movies, themselves. Sherri Sylvester reports. SHERRI SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Two summers after \"The Blair Witch\" cast a spell on Web surfers, the studios have seen the spirit of Internet movie marketing.\" Nearly every major summer movie is generating online buzz with sites that go far beyond the old fashioned trailer watching. AARON SCHATZ, LYCOS.COM: You have to turn it into a must see movie. If you\\'ve been playing the A.I. game for three months, when A.I. comes out, you\\'re going. SYLVESTER: The A.I. game began when the film\\'s posters and trailer revealed this credit. Watch closely. Jeanine Salla Sentient Machine Therapist sent surfers searching under her name for clues to the Spielberg film. BRANDON GRAY, ZAPTOIT.COM: Actually, what sprung up were all these sites for Dr. Jeanine Salla. And she\\'s apparently -- she\\'s a part of this fictional university called Bangalore University. And there\\'s all these links. There\\'s like -- it\\'s a labyrinth of sites. SYLVESTER: We went out searching for signs of intelligence life with Brandon Gray from Zaptoit.com. GRAY: If you go to Google.com, it\\'s a search engine, and you type in Jeanine Salla, you\\'ll be taken to a number of sites. I believe this is the group that\\'s trying to liberate the robots with the artificial intelligence, so that they have the same length as human beings. This is the Coalition for Robotic Freedom is the name. You\\'ll find links to the actual fan site that are trying to figure this whole thing out. Like here\\'s a Yahoo club about the Jeanine Salla conspiracy. SYLVESTER: \"Planet of the Apes\" has gone into cyberspace with a real- life scavenger hunt. Click on \"project apes\" or find coordinates to use with a global positioning satellite. Props from the film and other prizes can be found around the world. GRAY: Mission number four, southern bowl. It\\'s hidden somewhere in South America. SYLVESTER: No one knows who is playing this game or another operation Swordfish. Here, cracking the code requires watching the film\\'s final credits. For the studios, it\\'s cheap crass promotion. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They have managed to create this whole online world. And people go to these Web sites and have started all of this buzz and interest around the movie without having to purchase extra commercials, extra TV time, extra trailer time. SYLVESTER: But is it all just an elaborate tease? The A.I. searchers called cloudmakers say watch for the eyes to spot a Web of deceit. GRAY: It\\'ll pop right here. See that? SYLVESTER (on camera): Yeah. GRAY: You get two little blue eyes. The A.I. eyes of Haley Joel Osment. SYLVESTER (voice-over): So we asked Osment about Jeanine Salla. HALEY JOEL OSMENT, ACTOR: I actually didn\\'t have that much work with her because she\\'s post-production. SYLVESTER: Hmm, maybe a case of artificial intelligence.
