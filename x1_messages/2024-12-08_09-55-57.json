        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a bag with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, making a total of 10 balls. We're drawing two balls without replacement, and we want to find the probability that both balls are of different colors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw the first ball, it stays out, and the second ball is drawn from the remaining balls. So, the total number of balls changes after the first draw.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability that the two balls are of different colors. That means one is red and the other is blue. It could be red first then blue, or blue first then red.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to calculate the probabilities of these two scenarios separately and then add them up.\n\nLet's start with the probability of drawing a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 4 red out of 10 total, so that's 4/10 or 2/5.\n\nAfter drawing a red ball, there are now 9 balls left in the bag, with 6 of them being blue. So, the probability of drawing a blue ball next is 6/9 or 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball first and then a blue ball is (2/5) * (2/3) = 4/15.\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of drawing a blue ball first and then a red ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue ball first is 6 blue out of 10 total, which is 6/10 or 3/5.\n\nAfter drawing a blue ball, there are now 9 balls left, with 4 of them being red. So, the probability of drawing a red ball next is 4/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a blue ball first and then a red ball is (3/5) * (4/9) = 12/45, which simplifies to 4/15.\n\nNow, since these two scenarios are mutually exclusive (you can't have both red then blue and blue then red at the same time), we can add their probabilities together to get the total probability of drawing two balls of different colors.\n\nSo, total probability = (4/15) + (4/15) = 8/15.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the probability that both balls are the same color and subtract that from 1, since the only other possibilities are different colors.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are the same color is the probability that both are red plus the probability that both are blue.\n\nFirst, probability that both are red:\n\nProbability of first ball being red is 4/10.\n\nAfter drawing a red, the probability of second ball being red is 3/9.\n\nSo, (4/10)*(3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15.\n\nNext, probability that both are blue:\n\nProbability of first ball being blue is 6/10.\n\nAfter drawing a blue, the probability of second ball being blue is 5/9.\n\nSo, (6/10)*(5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are the same color is 2/15 + 1/3.\n\nWait, to add these, I need a common denominator. 1/3 is equivalent to 5/15, so 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15.\n\nThen, the probability that both balls are of different colors is 1 - 7/15 = 8/15.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 8/15 is the probability that both balls are of different colors.\n\nLet me see if there's yet another way to confirm this.\n\nI've heard of combinations being used in probability problems like this. So, maybe I can use combinations to calculate the probability.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 10 is C(10,2), which is 45.\n\nThe number of ways to draw one red and one blue is C(4,1)*C(6,1), which is 4*6=24.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 24/45, which simplifies to 8/15.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, I'm confident that 8/15 is correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach.\n\nSuppose I think about it in terms of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that the second ball is a different color from the first.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the first ball's color. Doesn't matter which it is, but I need to consider both cases.\n\nSo, P(second ball different | first ball red) * P(first ball red) + P(second ball different | first ball blue) * P(first ball blue).\n\nWe already calculated P(first ball red) = 4/10, and P(second ball blue | first ball red) = 6/9.\n\nSimilarly, P(first ball blue) = 6/10, and P(second ball red | first ball blue) = 4/9.\n\nSo, overall probability = (6/9)*(4/10) + (4/9)*(6/10) = (24/90) + (24/90) = 48/90 = 8/15.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently from multiple angles.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are of different colors is 8/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{15}} \\]"
