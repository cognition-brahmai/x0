        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the car rental company charges a flat fee of $25 per day and an additional $0.15 per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for 4 days and driving 200 miles during that time.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost of renting the car for 4 days. Since the flat fee is $25 per day, I'll multiply $25 by 4.\n\n$25 * 4 = $100\n\nSo, the cost for 4 days is $100.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 200 miles. The charge is $0.15 per mile, so I'll multiply $0.15 by 200.\n\n$0.15 * 200 = $30\n\nSo, the cost for driving 200 miles is $30.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I'll add the two amounts together.\n\n$100 + $30 = $130\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car for 4 days and drive 200 miles would be $130.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{130} \\]"
