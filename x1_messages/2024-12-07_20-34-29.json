        "content": "Alright, let's solve the equation 3x - 7 = 2x + 5 for x. So, the goal here is to isolate x on one side of the equation. Let's see how we can do that.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are x terms on both sides of the equation. Maybe I can get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Let's try subtracting 2x from both sides to eliminate the x term on the right side.\n\nSo, starting with:\n\n3x - 7 = 2x + 5\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides:\n\n3x - 2x - 7 = 2x - 2x + 5\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx - 7 = 5\n\nNow, I have x - 7 = 5. To isolate x, I need to get rid of the -7. I can do that by adding 7 to both sides.\n\nSo, adding 7 to both sides:\n\nx - 7 + 7 = 5 + 7\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx = 12\n\nWait a minute, let me check my work. If I plug x = 12 back into the original equation, does it hold true?\n\nOriginal equation: 3x - 7 = 2x + 5\n\nPlugging in x = 12:\n\n3(12) - 7 = 2(12) + 5\n\nThat's 36 - 7 = 24 + 5\n\n29 = 29\n\nYes, it checks out. So, x = 12 is the correct solution.\n\nBut let me try another approach to see if I get the same answer. Maybe I can add 7 to both sides first to eliminate the -7 on the left side.\n\nStarting again with:\n\n3x - 7 = 2x + 5\n\nAdd 7 to both sides:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 2x + 5 + 7\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3x = 2x + 12\n\nNow, subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n3x - 2x = 2x - 2x + 12\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx = 12\n\nAgain, x = 12. That's reassuring.\n\nLet me try one more way, just for fun. What if I subtract 3x from both sides instead?\n\nStarting with:\n\n3x - 7 = 2x + 5\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides:\n\n3x - 3x - 7 = 2x - 3x + 5\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n-7 = -x + 5\n\nNow, to isolate x, I can subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n-7 - 5 = -x + 5 - 5\n\nWhich gives:\n\n-12 = -x\n\nNow, to solve for x, I can multiply both sides by -1:\n\n-1 * -12 = -1 * (-x)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n12 = x\n\nAgain, x = 12. No matter which method I use, I keep getting the same answer, which is a good sign that I've got it right.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility that there might be no solution or infinite solutions. In this case, since it's a linear equation and I ended up with a single solution, x = 12, that should be the case. There are no variables disappearing or anything like that which would suggest no solution or infinite solutions.\n\nAlternatively, if the equation were something like 3x - 7 = 3x + 5, then subtracting 3x from both sides would give -7 = 5, which is not true, so there would be no solution. But in this case, that's not happening.\n\nAlternatively, if it were something like 3x - 7 = 3x - 7, then subtracting 3x from both sides would give -7 = -7, which is always true, so there would be infinite solutions. But again, not the case here.\n\nSo, definitely, x = 12 is the correct and only solution.\n\nLet me try to make this equation a bit more complicated to see if I can still solve it. Suppose there are parentheses involved. For example, 3(x - 2) - 7 = 2(x + 1) + 5. Can I solve that?\n\nFirst, I need to expand the parentheses.\n\n3(x - 2) - 7 = 2(x + 1) + 5\n\nWhich is:\n\n3x - 6 - 7 = 2x + 2 + 5\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\n3x - 13 = 2x + 7\n\nNow, subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n3x - 2x - 13 = 2x - 2x + 7\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx - 13 = 7\n\nAdd 13 to both sides:\n\nx - 13 + 13 = 7 + 13\n\nSo, x = 20\n\nLet me check this by plugging x = 20 back into the original equation:\n\n3(20 - 2) - 7 = 2(20 + 1) + 5\n\nThat's 3(18) - 7 = 2(21) + 5\n\n54 - 7 = 42 + 5\n\n47 = 47\n\nIt checks out. So, x = 20 is the correct solution for that modified equation.\n\nBut in the original equation, it's just x = 12.\n\nI think I've covered this sufficiently. The answer is x = 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
