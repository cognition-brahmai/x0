Detective Alexander Hart stood at the center, his eyes scanning the cluttered space. He had been called here, to this old mansion on the outskirts of the city, for a case that defied conventional explanation.\n\nA murder had taken place, and the victim was found in this very room, lifeless and cold, with no signs of struggle or forced entry. The local police were stumped; there were no fingerprints, no witnesses, and no motive. It was as if the killer had vanished into thin air.\n\nAlexander, however, possessed a unique ability: he could see fragments of the past by touching objects that had witnessed events. It was a gift, or perhaps a curse, that had made him one of the most sought-after detectives in the business.\n\nHe approached the body, now covered with a white sheet, and took a deep breath. The room was filled with the usual suspects: the victim's family, the police chief, and a few curious onlookers. But Alexander's focus was solely on the crime scene.\n\nFirst, he examined the window. It was shut tight, but the lock showed signs of recent use. He placed his hand on the cold glass and closed his eyes, letting his mind drift back in time.\n\n*Flashback:*\n\n_The window creaked open, and a figure slipped through, silhouetted against the moonlight. He moved with purpose, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of life._\n\n*End Flashback.*\n\nAlexander opened his eyes, a frown etched on his face. \"Someone entered through the window,\" he stated, turning to the police chief. \"But who?\"\n\nNext, he moved to the desk, where a half-empty glass of wine sat beside an open book. He touched the glass, feeling the residual warmth.\n\n*Flashback:*\n\n_The victim, a middle-aged man with graying hair, sat at the desk, sipping his wine and reading. His expression was one of contentment, unaware of the impending danger._\n\n*End Flashback.*\n\nAlexander noted the time: it was around 9 PM, according to the position of the sun outside. He made a mental note of this.\n\nHe then picked up the book, feeling its leather-bound cover. As he touched it, images flooded his mind.\n\n*Flashback:*\n\n_The same man, engrossed in reading, smiled at something in the book. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. He set the book down and walked towards the entrance._\n\n*End Flashback.*\n\nAlexander's eyes widened. \"There was a visitor,\" he said aloud. \"The victim was expecting someone.\"\n\nHe walked over to the door and touched the doorknob. This time, the vision was clearer.\n\n*Flashback:*\n\n_The man opened the door, revealing a woman in a long coat, her face partially hidden by a hat. They exchanged a few words, too indistinct to hear, and then the woman entered the room._\n\n*End Flashback.*\n\nAlexander's mind raced. \"A woman visited the victim around 9 PM. They talked, and then...?\"\n\nHe needed to find out what happened next. He looked around the room, searching for another object that might hold clues.\n\nHis gaze fell on a small, ornate box on the mantlepiece. It was made of polished wood, intricate carvings adorning its surface. He walked over and touched it, feeling the smoothness of the wood.\n\n*Flashback:*\n\n_The woman and the man were standing near the fireplace, their voices low. The woman reached into her coat and pulled out a small box, placing it on the mantle. The man looked at it, confusion etched on his face._\n\n_\"What is this?\" he asked._\n\n_\"It's for you,\" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper._\n\n_He opened the box, revealing a beautiful, antique watch. His eyes lit up with surprise and pleasure._\n\n_\"Thank you,\" he said, taking the watch from the box._\n\n_But then, his expression changed. He looked at her with suspicion. \"Why are you giving me this?\"_\n\n_She hesitated, then took a step closer to him. \"Because I love you.\"_\n\n_His face softened. \"But I thought... I thought you were just a friend.\"_\n\n_She shook her head. \"I've always cared for you more than just friendship.\"_\n\n_He seemed torn, unsure of how to respond. Just then, there was a loud noise from outside, like a car backfiring. Startled, the man looked towards the window._\n\n_In that moment, the woman lunged at him, a knife glinting in her hand. She buried it deep into his chest, and he collapsed to the ground, eyes wide with shock and pain._\n\n_She stood there for a moment, panting, then quickly retrieved the knife and wiped it clean on the man's shirt. She picked up the box and the watch, making sure nothing incriminated her was left behind._\n\n_Then, she opened the window and climbed out, closing it quietly behind her._\n\n*End Flashback.*\n\nAlexander pulled his hand away from the box, his mind reeling from the vivid images. He had witnessed the murder, thanks to his ability.\n\nHe turned to the police chief, determination in his eyes. \"I know who did this,\" he said confidently. \"And I can prove it.\"\n\nThe chief raised an eyebrow. \"Really? Who is it?\"\n\nAlexander took a deep breath. \"The victim's lover. A woman named Elizabeth Thompson. She came here to give him an antique watch as a gift, but when he rejected her advances, she killed him in a fit of rage.\"\n\nThe chief looked skeptical. \"Do you have any evidence to support this claim?\"\n\nAlexander nodded. \"Yes. The watch is the key. It has her fingerprints on it. And I can describe the scene in detail, including the exact words they exchanged.\"\n\nHe proceeded to recount the entire sequence of events, based on what he had seen through the box. The chief listened intently, his expression changing from doubt to interest.\n\n\"Alright,\" he finally said. \"I'll have my team look into this Elizabeth Thompson. If she has a solid alibi, then your theory falls apart. But if not...\"\n\nAlexander smiled. \"I'm confident she's our killer. And with the watch as evidence, we can bring her to justice.\"\n\nAs the chief gave orders to his officers, Alexander couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Another case solved, thanks to his unique gift. But he also knew that each case brought its own share of emotional toll. Witnessing such violence, even indirectly, took its toll on him.\n\nBut that was the price he paid for his abilities. And he wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n**End of Scene**"
