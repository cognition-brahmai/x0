So, first, I need to find out the total number of windows in the whole village.\n\nTotal windows = Number of houses \u00d7 Windows per house\nTotal windows = 20 \u00d7 4 = 80 windows\n\nNow, the storm broke half of the windows in every house. So, I need to find out how many windows were broken in total.\n\nBroken windows per house = Half of the windows per house\nBroken windows per house = 4 / 2 = 2 windows\n\nTotal broken windows = Number of houses \u00d7 Broken windows per house\nTotal broken windows = 20 \u00d7 2 = 40 windows\n\nAlternatively, since half of all the windows were broken, I could have calculated it as:\n\nTotal broken windows = Half of total windows\nTotal broken windows = 80 / 2 = 40 windows\n\nEither way, the total number of broken windows that need to be fixed is 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
