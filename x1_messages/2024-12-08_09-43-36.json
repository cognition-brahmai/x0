        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to figure out how many possible 4-digit PIN codes can be created using the numbers 0 through 9, with the condition that each number can only be used once in a code. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a PIN code is a sequence of numbers, and in this case, it's 4 digits long. Each digit can be from 0 to 9, and no number repeats in the code. So, for example, 1234 would be allowed, but 1224 wouldn't because the number 2 is repeated.\n\nI think this is a permutation problem because the order of the numbers matters in a PIN code. For instance, 1234 is different from 4321, even though they use the same digits.\n\nSo, in permutations, we consider the arrangement of items where the order is important. The formula for permutations when selecting r items from a set of n items without replacement is:\n\n\\[ P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\n- \\( n - r \\) accounts for the items not chosen.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( n = 10 \\) because there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9).\n\n- \\( r = 4 \\) because the PIN code is 4 digits long.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ P(10, 4) = \\frac{10!}{(10 - 4)!} = \\frac{10!}{6!} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate the factorials.\n\nFirst, \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3,628,800 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720 \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{10!}{6!} = \\frac{3,628,800}{720} = 5,040 \\)\n\nTherefore, there are 5,040 possible unique 4-digit PIN codes where each digit is from 0 to 9 and no digit repeats.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this because sometimes with permutations, especially in PIN codes, we might need to consider if leading zeros are allowed or not. For example, is 0123 a valid PIN code?\n\nIn many real-world scenarios, PIN codes can start with zero. For instance, if you have a safe or a digital lock, entering 0123 would be different from 1234. So, yes, leading zeros should be considered valid in this context.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation stands: there are 5,040 possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it step by step:\n\n- For the first digit, I have 10 choices (0 through 9).\n\n- For the second digit, since one number has already been used, I have 9 remaining choices.\n\n- For the third digit, I have 8 choices left.\n\n- For the fourth digit, I have 7 choices left.\n\nSo, the total number of possible PIN codes is:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 5,040 \\]\n\nThis matches my previous calculation, which is a good sign that I'm correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the condition \"each number can only be used once\" affects anything else. Since it's a permutation without replacement, yes, it does exactly that: it ensures that no digit is repeated in the code.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total number of possible 4-digit codes with repetition allowed, which would be \\( 10^4 = 10,000 \\), and then subtract the number of codes with repeated digits. But that seems more complicated, and my initial approach seems sufficient and accurate.\n\nI can also consider a smaller example to verify. Suppose I want to create 2-digit PIN codes with digits from 0 to 9, without repetition.\n\nUsing the permutation formula:\n\n\\[ P(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{8!} = 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\]\n\nManually listing them: 01, 02, 03, ..., 09, 10, 12, 13, ..., 19, 20, 21, 23, ..., and so on, up to 98. Indeed, there are 90 unique 2-digit codes without repetition.\n\nThis smaller example confirms my understanding and application of the permutation formula.\n\nTherefore, for the original problem, the number of possible 4-digit PIN codes with unique digits is 5,040.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5040} \\]"
