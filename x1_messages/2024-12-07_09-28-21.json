        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in the room. 75% of them are wearing glasses. So, first, I need to find out how many people are wearing glasses.\n\nTo find 75% of 100, I can calculate:\n\n75% of 100 = (75/100) * 100 = 75 people\n\nSo, 75 people are wearing glasses.\n\nNow, 80% of those wearing glasses also wear hats. So, I need to find out how many people wearing glasses also wear hats.\n\nTo find 80% of 75, I can calculate:\n\n80% of 75 = (80/100) * 75\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n80 divided by 100 is 0.8, and 0.8 multiplied by 75 is 60.\n\nSo, 60 people are wearing both glasses and hats.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I should double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again: 75% of 100 people wear glasses, which is 75 people.\n\nThen, 80% of these 75 people also wear hats.\n\nSo, 80% of 75 is indeed 60.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as:\n\nTotal people = 100\n\nPercentage wearing glasses = 75%\n\nPercentage of glasses wearers also wearing hats = 80%\n\nSo, the number of people wearing both glasses and hats is 75 * (80/100) = 60\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: out of 100 people, 75 wear glasses, and of those, 80% also wear hats. So, 80% of 75 is 60.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 60 people are wearing both glasses and hats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
