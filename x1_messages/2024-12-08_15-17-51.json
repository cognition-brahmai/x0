Earthquakes occur due to the movement of tectonic plates, and areas located near plate boundaries or fault lines are more prone to frequent seismic activities. Even regions not directly on plate boundaries can experience earthquakes due to various geological factors. It's essential to stay informed about earthquake risks and preparedness in your area."
