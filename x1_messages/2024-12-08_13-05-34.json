But interestingly, lions don't actually live in jungles; they inhabit grasslands and savannas in Africa and some parts of India. The term \"king of the jungle\" might have originated from the lion's position as an apex predator and its majestic appearance, but etymologically, it's a bit of a misnomer since they don't reside in jungles. It's more accurate to think of them as the \"king of the savanna.\"\n"
