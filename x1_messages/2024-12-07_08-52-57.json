        "content": "Alright, I'll help you create a simple Python script that takes two numbers and an operator from the user, performs the operation, and prints the result. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to get input from the user. In Python, we can use the `input()` function to do this. We'll ask the user to enter two numbers and the operator they want to use.\n\nNext, we need to perform the operation based on the operator provided. For this, we can use conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else`.\n\nFinally, we'll print out the result.\n\nLet's start by writing the code to get input from the user.\n\n```python\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\noperator = input(\"Enter operator (+,-,*,/): \")\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n```\n\nHere, we're using `float()` to convert the input strings to floating-point numbers so that we can perform mathematical operations on them.\n\nNow, we need to handle different operators. We'll use if-elif-else statements for this.\n\n```python\nif operator == \"+\":\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == \"-\":\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == \"*\":\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        result = \"Error! Division by zero.\"\nelse:\n    result = \"Invalid operator!\"\n```\n\nIn this code, we check what operator the user entered and perform the corresponding operation. If the operator is division (/), we also need to check if the second number is not zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nFinally, we'll print the result.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Result: \", result)\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the complete script looks like this:\n\n```python\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\noperator = input(\"Enter operator (+,-,*,/): \")\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\nif operator == \"+\":\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif operator == \"-\":\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif operator == \"*\":\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif operator == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        result = \"Error! Division by zero.\"\nelse:\n    result = \"Invalid operator!\"\n\nprint(\"Result: \", result)\n```\n\nThis script will take two numbers and an operator from the user, perform the operation, and display the result. It also handles division by zero and invalid operators.\n\n**Note:** When running this script, make sure to enter valid numbers and operators. If you enter a non-numeric value for numbers, it will raise a `ValueError`. To handle this, you can add try-except blocks to handle exceptions, but for simplicity, we'll keep it like this for now.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
