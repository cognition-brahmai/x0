        "content": "Let's see. The company's revenue started at $100,000. In the first year, it increased by 20%. So, to find the increased amount, I need to calculate 20% of $100,000.\n\n20% of $100,000 is (20/100) * 100,000 = 0.2 * 100,000 = $20,000.\n\nSo, the revenue at the end of the first year is $100,000 + $20,000 = $120,000.\n\nNow, in the second year, the revenue decreased by 10%. I need to find 10% of $120,000 to see how much it decreased.\n\n10% of $120,000 is (10/100) * 120,000 = 0.1 * 120,000 = $12,000.\n\nSo, the revenue decreased by $12,000 in the second year.\n\nTherefore, the revenue at the end of the second year is $120,000 - $12,000 = $108,000.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this? Maybe using decimal multipliers?\n\nYes, I can use decimal multipliers for percentage changes.\n\nFor the first year, a 20% increase means multiplying by 1 + 0.20 = 1.20.\n\nSo, $100,000 * 1.20 = $120,000.\n\nIn the second year, a 10% decrease means multiplying by 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nSo, $120,000 * 0.90 = $108,000.\n\nThat confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could combine the two percentage changes into a single multiplier.\n\nFirst, a 20% increase followed by a 10% decrease.\n\nThe combined multiplier would be 1.20 * 0.90 = 1.08.\n\nSo, the final revenue would be $100,000 * 1.08 = $108,000.\n\nInteresting, so all these methods lead to the same result.\n\nBut I should be careful with the combined percentage change. It's not just 20% - 10% = 10%. That would be incorrect because the percentage changes are applied sequentially, not arithmetically added.\n\nIn this case, a 20% increase followed by a 10% decrease results in an overall increase of 8%, as seen from the combined multiplier of 1.08.\n\nTo verify, $100,000 * 1.08 = $108,000, which matches the previous calculations.\n\nSo, the revenue at the end of the second year is $108,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{108000} \\]"
