        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells packs of pencils, and each pack contains 12 pencils. The store received a shipment of 500 packs. First, I need to find out how many packs were sold in the first week. The problem says that 60% of the packs were sold. So, I'll calculate 60% of 500 packs.\n\nTo find 60% of 500, I can multiply 500 by 0.60:\n\n500 \u00d7 0.60 = 300 packs sold.\n\nNow, if 300 packs were sold, then the number of packs remaining unsold would be the total packs minus the sold packs:\n\n500 - 300 = 200 packs unsold.\n\nBut the question asks for the number of individual pencils that remain unsold. Since each pack contains 12 pencils, I need to multiply the number of unsold packs by 12 to get the total number of unsold pencils:\n\n200 \u00d7 12 = 2400 pencils.\n\nSo, there are 2400 individual pencils remaining unsold after the first week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with 500 packs, each containing 12 pencils, the total number of pencils initially is:\n\n500 \u00d7 12 = 6000 pencils.\n\nIf 60% of the packs were sold, then 60% of 500 packs is 300 packs sold, as I calculated earlier. The number of pencils sold would be:\n\n300 \u00d7 12 = 3600 pencils.\n\nTherefore, the number of pencils remaining unsold would be the total pencils minus the sold pencils:\n\n6000 - 3600 = 2400 pencils.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation. So, the final answer is 2400 individual pencils remain unsold after the first week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]"
