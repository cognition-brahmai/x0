        "content": "So the car dealership sells 15 cars in the first week, and then their sales increase by 10% each week after that. We need to find out how many cars they sell in total over four weeks. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, week one is straightforward: they sell 15 cars.\n\nNow, for week two, sales increase by 10%. So, I need to calculate 10% of 15 and add that to the original 15 cars.\n\n10% of 15 is 1.5, so in week two, they sell 15 + 1.5 = 16.5 cars. But since you can't sell half a car, maybe I should keep it as a decimal for now and worry about whole numbers at the end.\n\nWait, actually, in business, it's possible to sell fractions of a car if they're being sold in parts or something, but I think in this context, it's safer to assume whole numbers. Maybe I should round to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, in week two, they sell 16.5 cars, which I'll round to 17 cars.\n\nNow, for week three, sales increase by another 10% from week two's sales.\n\nSo, 10% of 17 is 1.7, and adding that to 17 gives 18.7, which I'll round to 19 cars.\n\nThen, for week four, again a 10% increase from week three's sales.\n\n10% of 19 is 1.9, so 19 + 1.9 = 20.9, which I'll round to 21 cars.\n\nNow, to find the total sales over the four weeks, I'll add up the sales from each week:\n\nWeek one: 15\n\nWeek two: 17\n\nWeek three: 19\n\nWeek four: 21\n\nTotal: 15 + 17 = 32, plus 19 is 51, plus 21 is 72.\n\nSo, they sell a total of 72 cars over the four-week period.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 15 cars in week one.\n\nWeek two: 15 + (0.10 * 15) = 15 + 1.5 = 16.5, rounded to 17.\n\nWeek three: 17 + (0.10 * 17) = 17 + 1.7 = 18.7, rounded to 19.\n\nWeek four: 19 + (0.10 * 19) = 19 + 1.9 = 20.9, rounded to 21.\n\nTotal: 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 = 72.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric sequence where each term is the previous term multiplied by 1.10 (since it's a 10% increase each week).\n\nSo, week one: 15\n\nWeek two: 15 * 1.10 = 16.5\n\nWeek three: 16.5 * 1.10 = 18.15, which is approximately 18.15, but I previously rounded it to 19. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I should keep the decimals without rounding until the end.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nWeek one: 15\n\nWeek two: 15 * 1.10 = 16.5\n\nWeek three: 16.5 * 1.10 = 18.15\n\nWeek four: 18.15 * 1.10 = 19.965\n\nNow, adding them up: 15 + 16.5 + 18.15 + 19.965 = let's see:\n\n15 + 16.5 = 31.5\n\n31.5 + 18.15 = 49.65\n\n49.65 + 19.965 = 69.615\n\nSo, total sales over four weeks would be approximately 69.615 cars.\n\nBut since we're dealing with whole cars, I need to round this to the nearest whole number, which would be 70 cars.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 72 cars when rounding each week's sales to the nearest whole number before summing them up.\n\nThere's a difference here.\n\nWhich approach is correct?\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nIn reality, sales would likely be in whole numbers each week, so rounding to the nearest whole number each week makes sense.\n\nBut from a mathematical perspective, it's more accurate to keep the decimals throughout the calculation and round only at the end.\n\nSo, according to that, the total sales would be approximately 70 cars.\n\nBut considering the practical aspect, rounding each week's sales might be more appropriate.\n\nLet me check the instructions again.\n\nIt says: \"their sales increase by 10% each week after that.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify whether the increase is compounded or not.\n\nIf it's compounded, then using the geometric sequence approach is correct.\n\nBut if it's a straightforward 10% increase each week based on the previous week's sales, then rounding each week might be acceptable.\n\nTo be precise, I should use the geometric sequence approach and round only at the end.\n\nSo, total sales = 15 + 15*1.10 + 15*(1.10)^2 + 15*(1.10)^3\n\nCalculating that:\n\n15 + 16.5 + 18.15 + 19.965 = 69.615, which rounds to 70 cars.\n\nTherefore, the total sales over the four-week period would be approximately 70 cars.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose we consider the sales increase compounded weekly.\n\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a * (1 - r^n)/(1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, a = 15, r = 1.10, n = 4.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 15 * (1 - 1.10^4)/(1 - 1.10)\n\nFirst, calculate 1.10^4:\n\n1.10^4 = 1.4641\n\nNow, 1 - 1.4641 = -0.4641\n\n1 - 1.10 = -0.10\n\nSo, S = 15 * (-0.4641)/(-0.10) = 15 * 4.641 = 69.615, which again rounds to 70 cars.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total sales over the four-week period would be approximately 70 cars.\n\nBut earlier, when I rounded each week's sales to the nearest whole number and then summed them up, I got 72 cars.\n\nThis discrepancy is due to the timing of the rounding.\n\nTo maintain accuracy, it's better to perform the calculations with decimals and round only at the end.\n\nHence, the final answer is approximately 70 cars.\n\nAlternatively, if the context allows for fractional cars, the exact total would be 69.615 cars.\n\nBut since car sales are typically in whole numbers, rounding to 70 is appropriate.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
