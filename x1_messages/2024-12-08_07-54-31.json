        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that sells two types of widgets, A and B. The profit from each A widget is $15, and from each B widget is $25. In one month, they sold a total of 300 widgets and made a total profit of $6,500. We need to find out how many of each type they sold.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of A widgets sold as \\( x \\) and the number of B widgets sold as \\( y \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of widgets sold is 300.\n\n2. The total profit from these widgets is $6,500.\n\nSo, we can write two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 300 \\)   (since the total number of widgets is 300)\n\n2. \\( 15x + 25y = 6500 \\)   (since the total profit is $6,500)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I'll use the substitution method here.\n\nFirst, solve equation 1 for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 300 - y \\)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into equation 2:\n\n\\( 15(300 - y) + 25y = 6500 \\)\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n\\( 15*300 - 15y + 25y = 6500 \\)\n\n\\( 4500 - 15y + 25y = 6500 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 4500 + 10y = 6500 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 4500 from both sides:\n\n\\( 10y = 2000 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n\\( y = 200 \\)\n\nSo, the number of B widgets sold is 200.\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 300 - 200 = 100 \\)\n\nTherefore, the company sold 100 A widgets and 200 B widgets.\n\nLet's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they sold 100 A widgets at $15 each, that's \\( 100 * 15 = 1500 \\) dollars. For 200 B widgets at $25 each, that's \\( 200 * 25 = 5000 \\) dollars. Adding those profits together: \\( 1500 + 5000 = 6500 \\), which matches the total profit given.\n\nSo, the solution is correct. The company sold 100 units of widget A and 200 units of widget B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\text{ units of widget A and } 200 \\text{ units of widget B}} \\]"
