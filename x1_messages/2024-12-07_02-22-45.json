        "content": "So the library has 120 books in total, and 40% of them are fiction. I need to find out how many non-fiction books there are. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many fiction books there are. Since 40% of the books are fiction, I can calculate that by taking 40% of 120. To find a percentage of a number, I multiply the percentage by the number. But I need to remember to convert the percentage to a decimal first. So, 40% is the same as 0.40.\n\nSo, the number of fiction books is 0.40 times 120. Let me do that calculation:\n\n0.40 \u00d7 120 = 48\n\nSo, there are 48 fiction books.\n\nNow, to find the number of non-fiction books, I subtract the number of fiction books from the total number of books.\n\nNon-fiction books = total books - fiction books\n\nNon-fiction books = 120 - 48 = 72\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Another way to think about it is that if 40% are fiction, then the remaining percentage must be non-fiction. So, 100% - 40% = 60% are non-fiction.\n\nSo, I can also find the number of non-fiction books by calculating 60% of 120.\n\nLet me do that to confirm:\n\n60% of 120 is 0.60 \u00d7 120 = 72\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, there are 72 non-fiction books in the library.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can check if adding the fiction and non-fiction books gives me the total number of books.\n\n48 (fiction) + 72 (non-fiction) = 120\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use proportions or ratios, but that might be overcomplicating things for this problem. The straightforward approach seems fine here.\n\nI think I've got it right. The library has 72 non-fiction books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]\n"
