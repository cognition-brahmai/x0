        "content": "So I have this problem here about students playing soccer and basketball. Let me see if I can figure this out. There are 50 students in total. 25 play soccer, 20 play basketball, and 15 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport.\n\nOkay, first, I think I should find out how many students play at least one of the sports. That would be the number of students who play soccer or basketball, considering that some play both.\n\nI recall there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle. It says that to find the total number of elements in two sets, you add the sizes of the sets and subtract the intersection to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, for students playing soccer or basketball, it would be:\n\nNumber playing soccer + number playing basketball - number playing both.\n\nThat would be 25 + 20 - 15 = 30 students play at least one of the sports.\n\nNow, since there are 50 students in total, the number who don't play either sport would be:\n\nTotal students - students playing at least one sport = 50 - 30 = 20 students.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using a Venn diagram would help visualize it.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents soccer players, and the other represents basketball players. The overlap is the students who play both sports.\n\nSo, the soccer circle has 25 students, but within that, 15 play both. That means 25 - 15 = 10 students play only soccer.\n\nThe basketball circle has 20 students, with 15 playing both, so 20 - 15 = 5 students play only basketball.\n\nThen, the overlap has 15 students who play both.\n\nSo, the total number of students playing at least one sport is:\n\nOnly soccer + only basketball + both = 10 + 5 + 15 = 30 students.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total: 50 - 30 = 20 students who don't play either sport.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can consider the possibility that some students play other sports not mentioned here. However, the problem only talks about soccer and basketball, so I think it's safe to assume that's all there is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some students play other sports, but since they're not mentioned, I should only consider soccer and basketball.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"don't play either sport,\" so I think it's straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nn(A \u222a B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \u2229 B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(A) is the number of students playing soccer (25)\n\n- n(B) is the number of students playing basketball (20)\n\n- n(A \u2229 B) is the number of students playing both (15)\n\nSo, n(A \u222a B) = 25 + 20 - 15 = 30\n\nThen, the number of students not playing either sport is the total number of students minus those playing at least one sport:\n\n50 - 30 = 20\n\nI think that's the answer. But to make sure, maybe I can consider the probability or percentage, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use a table to represent the data:\n\n|                | Soccer | Not Soccer | Total |\n\n|----------------|--------|------------|-------|\n\n| Basketball     | 15     | 5          | 20    |\n\n| Not Basketball | 10     | 20         | 30    |\n\n| Total          | 25     | 25         | 50    |\n\nFrom this table, it's clear that 20 students don't play either sport.\n\nWait, but in the table, the \"Not Basketball\" row and \"Not Soccer\" column intersect at 20 students who don't play either sport.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 20 students don't play either sport.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, perhaps I should consider if there's any possibility of students playing other sports affecting this count. However, since the question is only about soccer and basketball, and it's asking for students who don't play either of these sports, I think 20 is the correct answer.\n\nMaybe I can look at it from another angle. If 30 students play at least one of the two sports, then the remaining students don't play either. Since there are no other variables mentioned, it should be 50 - 30 = 20.\n\nI think that's solid. I can confidently say that 20 students don't play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
