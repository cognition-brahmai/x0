        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a factory produces 1200 units of product A in 8 hours, and I need to figure out how many units it will produce in 15 days if it works 10 hours per day. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rate at which the factory produces the units. It produces 1200 units in 8 hours. So, to find the hourly production rate, I can divide the total units by the total hours. That would be 1200 units divided by 8 hours, which is 150 units per hour. Okay, so the factory produces 150 units each hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many hours the factory works in 15 days if it works 10 hours per day. That should be straightforward. I multiply the number of days by the number of hours per day. So, 15 days times 10 hours per day equals 150 hours in total.\n\nNext, I'll take the total hours worked and multiply it by the hourly production rate to find the total units produced. So, 150 hours times 150 units per hour. Let's do the math: 150 times 150.\n\nWell, 150 times 100 is 15,000, and 150 times 50 is 7,500. So, adding those together, 15,000 plus 7,500 equals 22,500 units.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. Starting again: the factory produces 1200 units in 8 hours, which is indeed 150 units per hour. Then, working 10 hours per day for 15 days gives 150 hours in total. Multiplying 150 hours by 150 units per hour should give 22,500 units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Perhaps I can find the daily production first and then multiply by the number of days.\n\nLet's try that. If the factory works 8 hours and produces 1200 units, then in 10 hours, it should produce more units. So, first, find the production rate per hour, which is 150 units per hour, and then multiply by 10 hours to find the daily production.\n\n150 units per hour times 10 hours equals 1,500 units per day.\n\nThen, over 15 days, it would produce 1,500 units per day times 15 days, which is also 22,500 units.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, it seems like the factory will produce 22,500 units in 15 days working 10 hours per day.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors I might have missed. Is there any information about the factory's production efficiency, breaks, or downtime? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll assume the factory operates at a constant rate without any interruptions.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent throughout the calculation. I have units in hours and days, and I've converted everything appropriately. It looks fine.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up a proportion. If 8 hours result in 1200 units, then 10 hours per day would result in X units per day. So, I can set up the proportion:\n\n8 hours / 1200 units = 10 hours / X units\n\nThen, solving for X, I get X = (1200 units * 10 hours) / 8 hours = 1,500 units per day.\n\nThen, over 15 days, it's 1,500 units per day times 15 days, which again is 22,500 units.\n\nAlright, no matter which way I look at it, I keep arriving at the same answer. So, I'm confident that 22,500 units is the correct total production for 15 days working 10 hours per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22500} \\]"
