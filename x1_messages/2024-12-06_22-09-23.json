        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 2000 widgets per day. Each widget costs $10 to produce, and they sell each one for $15. I need to find out the daily profit.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total production cost per day. Since each widget costs $10 and they make 2000 of them, I can multiply 2000 by $10 to get the total cost.\n\nTotal production cost = 2000 widgets * $10/widget = $20,000\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total revenue from selling these widgets. They sell each widget for $15, so again, I'll multiply the number of widgets by the selling price.\n\nTotal revenue = 2000 widgets * $15/widget = $30,000\n\nNow, to find the profit, I need to subtract the total production cost from the total revenue.\n\nProfit = Total revenue - Total production cost = $30,000 - $20,000 = $10,000\n\nSo, the daily profit generated by the factory is $10,000.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider? Are there any other costs involved, like overhead or labor? The problem only mentions production cost per widget, so maybe that's all inclusive.\n\nAlso, it's important to make sure that all the units are consistent. Here, everything is per widget, and the quantities are in the same units, so that seems fine.\n\nI think $10,000 is the correct daily profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10000} \\]"
