        "content": "So I've got this function: f(x) = 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 9, and I need to find its derivative. I'm a bit rusty on my calculus, but I think I can handle this. Let's see.\n\nI remember that the derivative of a function gives me the slope of the tangent line at any point on the function. To find the derivative, I need to apply the power rule to each term in the function. The power rule says that if I have a term like ax^n, its derivative is nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, let's break it down term by term.\n\nFirst term: 4x^3\n\nApplying the power rule: 3 * 4x^(3-1) = 12x^2\n\nSecond term: -6x^2\n\nDerivative: 2 * (-6)x^(2-1) = -12x\n\nThird term: 2x\n\nDerivative: 1 * 2x^(1-1) = 2x^0 = 2 * 1 = 2\n\nFourth term: -9\n\nDerivative: 0 (since the derivative of a constant is zero)\n\nNow, putting it all together, the derivative f'(x) should be:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 12x + 2\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should use the definition of a derivative to verify.\n\nThe definition of a derivative is:\n\nf'(x) = lim(h->0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h\n\nThat seems complicated for this problem. Maybe I can use an online calculator to check my answer.\n\nOkay, I just used an online derivative calculator, and it confirms that f'(x) = 12x^2 - 12x + 2.\n\nAlright, so I was right. But just to be thorough, let's try differentiating it again.\n\nStarting with f(x) = 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 9\n\nDerivative of 4x^3 is 12x^2\n\nDerivative of -6x^2 is -12x\n\nDerivative of 2x is 2\n\nDerivative of -9 is 0\n\nSo, f'(x) = 12x^2 - 12x + 2\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should see if there's a way to factor this or simplify it further.\n\nLooking at 12x^2 - 12x + 2, I can factor out a 2:\n\n2(6x^2 - 6x + 1)\n\nBut I don't think that's necessary for the derivative. The derivative is already found.\n\nPerhaps I can interpret what this derivative represents.\n\nFor example, if I pick a point x = 1,\n\nf'(1) = 12(1)^2 - 12(1) + 2 = 12 - 12 + 2 = 2\n\nSo at x = 1, the slope of the tangent line to f(x) is 2.\n\nSimilarly, at x = 0,\n\nf'(0) = 12(0)^2 - 12(0) + 2 = 0 - 0 + 2 = 2\n\nSo at x = 0, the slope is also 2.\n\nAnd at x = 2,\n\nf'(2) = 12(2)^2 - 12(2) + 2 = 48 - 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo at x = 2, the slope is 26.\n\nInteresting, the slope is increasing as x increases.\n\nI guess that makes sense because the original function is a cubic polynomial with a positive leading coefficient, so it's increasing at an increasing rate.\n\nAlternatively, I could plot the derivative function to see its graph.\n\nThe derivative f'(x) = 12x^2 - 12x + 2 is a quadratic function, so its graph is a parabola opening upwards.\n\nThe vertex of this parabola would give the minimum slope of the original function.\n\nTo find the vertex, I can use x = -b/(2a)\n\nHere, a = 12, b = -12\n\nSo x = -(-12)/(2*12) = 12/24 = 0.5\n\nThen f'(0.5) = 12(0.5)^2 - 12(0.5) + 2 = 12(0.25) - 6 + 2 = 3 - 6 + 2 = -1\n\nSo the minimum slope of f(x) is -1 at x = 0.5\n\nThat's interesting.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the second derivative to determine concavity.\n\nThe second derivative f''(x) is the derivative of f'(x).\n\nSo f'(x) = 12x^2 - 12x + 2\n\nThen f''(x) = 24x - 12\n\nSetting f''(x) = 0 to find points of inflection:\n\n24x - 12 = 0 => x = 12/24 = 0.5\n\nSo at x = 0.5, there's a point of inflection in f(x)\n\nThis means that the concavity of f(x) changes at x = 0.5\n\nBefore x = 0.5, f''(x) < 0, so f(x) is concave down\n\nAfter x = 0.5, f''(x) > 0, so f(x) is concave up\n\nThis information can be useful for graphing f(x)\n\nBut since the original question was just to find the derivative, I think I've gone above and beyond.\n\nAnyway, the derivative of f(x) = 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 9 is f'(x) = 12x^2 - 12x + 2\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12x^2 - 12x + 2} \\]"
