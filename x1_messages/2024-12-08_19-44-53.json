        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Python script that connects to an SQLite database and performs CRUD operations on a table named \"students\" with columns: id, first_name, last_name, and grade. Additionally, I'll include a function to calculate the average grade of all students in the table.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need the `sqlite3` module, which is included in Python's standard library, so you don't need to install anything extra for that.\n\nLet's break down the tasks:\n\n1. **Connect to an SQLite database.**\n2. **Create a table named \"students\" with the specified columns.**\n3. **Perform CRUD operations:**\n   - **Create (Insert):** Add a new student to the table.\n   - **Read (Select):** Retrieve student data.\n   - **Update:** Modify student data.\n   - **Delete:** Remove a student from the table.\n4. **Calculate the average grade of all students.**\n\nI'll guide you through each step.\n\n### Step 1: Connect to an SQLite Database\n\nFirst, you need to establish a connection to an SQLite database. If the database doesn't exist, SQLite will create it automatically.\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef create_connection():\n    conn = None;\n    try:\n        conn = sqlite3.connect('students.db')\n        print(f'successful connection with sqlite version {sqlite3.version}')\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n    return conn\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create the \"students\" Table\n\nNext, you'll create a table named \"students\" with the specified columns.\n\n```python\ndef create_table(conn):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        cursor.execute('''\n            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (\n                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n                first_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n                last_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n                grade REAL NOT NULL\n            )\n        ''')\n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Table 'students' created successfully.\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n### Step 3: CRUD Operations\n\n#### Insert a New Student\n\n```python\ndef insert_student(conn, student):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = '''INSERT INTO students(first_name, last_name, grade) VALUES(?,?,?)'''\n        cursor.execute(query, student)\n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Student inserted successfully.\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n#### Retrieve Student Data\n\n```python\ndef select_all_students(conn):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = \"SELECT * FROM students\"\n        cursor.execute(query)\n        rows = cursor.fetchall()\n        for row in rows:\n            print(row)\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n#### Update Student Data\n\n```python\ndef update_student_grade(conn, student_id, new_grade):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = '''UPDATE students SET grade = ? WHERE id = ?'''\n        cursor.execute(query, (new_grade, student_id))\n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Student grade updated successfully.\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n#### Delete a Student\n\n```python\ndef delete_student(conn, student_id):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = \"DELETE FROM students WHERE id = ?\"\n        cursor.execute(query, (student_id,))\n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Student deleted successfully.\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Average Grade\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(conn):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = \"SELECT AVG(grade) FROM students\"\n        cursor.execute(query)\n        row = cursor.fetchone()\n        average = row[0]\n        print(f\"The average grade is: {average}\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\nNow, let's put all these functions together in a single script and test them.\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef create_connection():\n    conn = None;\n    try:\n        conn = sqlite3.connect('students.db')\n        print(f'successful connection with sqlite version {sqlite3.version}')\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n    return conn\n\ndef create_table(conn):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        cursor.execute('''\n            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (\n                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n                first_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n                last_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n                grade REAL NOT NULL\n            )\n        ''')\n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Table 'students' created successfully.\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n\ndef insert_student(conn, student):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = '''INSERT INTO students(first_name, last_name, grade) VALUES(?,?,?)'''\n        cursor.execute(query, student)\n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Student inserted successfully.\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n\ndef select_all_students(conn):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = \"SELECT * FROM students\"\n        cursor.execute(query)\n        rows = cursor.fetchall()\n        for row in rows:\n            print(row)\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n\ndef update_student_grade(conn, student_id, new_grade):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = '''UPDATE students SET grade = ? WHERE id = ?'''\n        cursor.execute(query, (new_grade, student_id))\n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Student grade updated successfully.\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n\ndef delete_student(conn, student_id):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = \"DELETE FROM students WHERE id = ?\"\n        cursor.execute(query, (student_id,))\n        conn.commit()\n        print(\"Student deleted successfully.\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n\ndef calculate_average_grade(conn):\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        query = \"SELECT AVG(grade) FROM students\"\n        cursor.execute(query)\n        row = cursor.fetchone()\n        average = row[0]\n        print(f\"The average grade is: {average}\")\n    except Error as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    conn = create_connection()\n    if conn is not None:\n        create_table(conn)\n        \n        # Inserting some students\n        student1 = ('John', 'Doe', 85.5)\n        student2 = ('Jane', 'Smith', 90.0)\n        insert_student(conn, student1)\n        insert_student(conn, student2)\n        \n        # Retrieving all students\n        print(\"All students:\")\n        select_all_students(conn)\n        \n        # Updating a student's grade\n        update_student_grade(conn, 1, 87.5)\n        print(\"Updated student 1's grade to 87.5\")\n        \n        # Deleting a student\n        delete_student(conn, 2)\n        print(\"Deleted student 2\")\n        \n        # Calculating average grade\n        calculate_average_grade(conn)\n        \n        # Closing the connection\n        conn.close()\n    else:\n        print(\"Error! cannot create the database connection.\")\n```\n\nThis script does the following:\n\n- Connects to an SQLite database named `students.db`.\n- Creates a table named `students` if it doesn't exist.\n- Inserts two students into the table.\n- Retrieves and prints all students.\n- Updates the grade of the first student.\n- Deletes the second student.\n- Calculates and prints the average grade of all students.\n- Closes the database connection.\n\nYou can run this script in your Python environment to see it in action. Make sure to handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during database operations.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
