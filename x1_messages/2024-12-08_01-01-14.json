She was known for her tireless dedication to improving the conditions of hospitals and the treatment of patients. Despite the societal norms of her time, she pursued her calling in nursing, driven by a sense of duty and a belief in the dignity of all human beings.\n\nShe was also a keen observer and a pioneer in the use of statistics in health care. Florence understood the importance of sanitation and hygiene in preventing disease, and she used data to demonstrate this. Her work in this area led to significant improvements in hospital conditions and a reduction in death rates.\n\nFlorence was not just a nurse but also a prolific writer. Her writings, which include notes on nursing and hospital planning, have had a profound influence on healthcare worldwide. Her approach to patient care emphasized not just physical treatment but also the importance of considering a patient's mental and emotional well-being.\n\nDespite her fame and the recognition she received, Florence remained humble and dedicated to her work. She believed in service to others and lived her life with a sense of purpose and dedication that continues to inspire many today.\nEmily: What does the smell of antiseptic remind you of?"
