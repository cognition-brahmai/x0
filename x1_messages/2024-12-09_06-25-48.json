        "content": "In electrical engineering, the term for the property of a system whose output is not directly proportional to its input is called nonlinearity. So, the correct answer is option C. Nonlinearity.\n\nTo elaborate, linearity refers to a system where the output is directly proportional to the input. In other words, if you double the input, the output also doubles. This is often represented mathematically by a straight-line relationship between input and output.\n\nNonlinearity, on the other hand, describes a system where this direct proportionality does not hold. The output does not change in direct proportion to changes in the input. This can lead to complex behaviors and is common in many real-world systems.\n\nReciprocity is a different property that refers to the symmetry of a system's response. In reciprocal systems, the relationship between two points is the same regardless of the direction of signal flow.\n\nTime-invariance refers to systems where the parameters do not change over time. In other words, the system's behavior remains consistent regardless of when the input is applied.\n\nSo, in summary, when a system's output isn't directly proportional to its input, it's exhibiting nonlinearity."
