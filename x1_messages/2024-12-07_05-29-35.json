        "content": "To create a Python script that fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap**: You need an API key to make requests to their service. Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api), sign up, and get your API key.\n\n2. **Install necessary Python packages**: You'll need `requests` to make HTTP requests. You can install it using pip if you don't have it already.\n\n3. **Write the script**: The script will take a city name as input, make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and display the current temperature, humidity, and weather description. It should also handle errors gracefully.\n\nHere's a sample script that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        'q': city,\n        'appid': api_key,\n        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit\n    }\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad status codes\n        data = response.json()\n        return data\n    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:\n        print(f\"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}\")\n    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as conn_err:\n        print(f\"Connection error occurred: {conn_err}\")\n    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as timeout_err:\n        print(f\"Timeout error occurred: {timeout_err}\")\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as req_err:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {req_err}\")\n    return None\n\ndef display_weather(data):\n    if data is None:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve data.\")\n        return\n    try:\n        temperature = data['main']['temp']\n        humidity = data['main']['humidity']\n        weather_description = data['weather'][0]['description']\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Weather Description: {weather_description}\")\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"Some data is missing or invalid.\")\n        print(data)  # For debugging purposes\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'  # Replace with your actual API key\n    city = input(\"Enter city name: \")\n    weather_data = get_weather(city, api_key)\n    display_weather(weather_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **get_weather function**:\n   - Constructs the API URL with the city name and API key.\n   - Makes a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n   - Handles various exceptions that might occur during the request, such as HTTP errors, connection errors, timeouts, etc.\n   - Returns the JSON response if successful, otherwise returns None.\n\n2. **display_weather function**:\n   - Extracts and prints the temperature, humidity, and weather description from the API response.\n   - Handles cases where the expected data is missing or invalid.\n\n3. **Main block**:\n   - Prompts the user to enter a city name.\n   - Calls the `get_weather` function with the provided city name and API key.\n   - Passes the received data to `display_weather` to display the results.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n- The `units` parameter in the API request is set to `'metric'` for Celsius. Change it to `'imperial'` for Fahrenheit if needed.\n- This script handles basic error cases, but you can expand the error handling based on specific needs or API behaviors.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point for fetching and displaying weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API in Python."
