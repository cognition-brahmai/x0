        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. Let's create a C++ class called \"BankAccount\" that manages an account's details like account number, holder's name, and balance. We'll include functions to deposit and withdraw money, as well as display the current balance. We'll also add validations to prevent withdrawals that exceed the current balance and to ensure that deposits are not negative.\n\nFirst, we need to include the necessary headers. We'll use `<iostream>` for input and output operations and `<string>` to handle the account holder's name.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n```\n\nNow, let's define the BankAccount class. We'll make the account number, holder's name, and balance private members to encapsulate the data and provide public member functions to interact with them.\n\n```cpp\nclass BankAccount {\nprivate:\n    int accountNumber;\n    std::string accountHolderName;\n    double balance;\npublic:\n    // Constructor to initialize the account\n    BankAccount(int accNum, const std::string& name, double initialBalance);\n\n    // Function to deposit money\n    void deposit(double amount);\n\n    // Function to withdraw money\n    void withdraw(double amount);\n\n    // Function to display the current balance\n    void displayBalance() const;\n};\n```\n\nNext, we'll implement the constructor. The constructor will take the account number, holder's name, and initial balance as parameters and initialize the private members.\n\n```cpp\nBankAccount::BankAccount(int accNum, const std::string& name, double initialBalance)\n    : accountNumber(accNum), accountHolderName(name), balance(initialBalance) {\n    // Ensure initial balance is not negative\n    if (initialBalance < 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"Initial balance cannot be negative. Setting balance to zero.\" << std::endl;\n        balance = 0.0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's implement the deposit function. This function should add the deposited amount to the current balance, but it should validate that the deposit amount is not negative.\n\n```cpp\nvoid BankAccount::deposit(double amount) {\n    if (amount < 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"Deposit amount cannot be negative.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        balance += amount;\n        std::cout << \"Deposited: \" << amount << \". New balance: \" << balance << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor the withdraw function, we need to ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the current balance. If it does, we should display an error message.\n\n```cpp\nvoid BankAccount::withdraw(double amount) {\n    if (amount < 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.\" << std::endl;\n    } else if (amount > balance) {\n        std::cerr << \"Insufficient funds. Cannot withdraw \" << amount << \".\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        balance -= amount;\n        std::cout << \"Withdrew: \" << amount << \". New balance: \" << balance << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the displayBalance function will simply output the current balance.\n\n```cpp\nvoid BankAccount::displayBalance() const {\n    std::cout << \"Current balance: \" << balance << std::endl;\n}\n```\n\nTo use this class, you can create an instance of BankAccount and call its member functions. Here's a simple example:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    BankAccount myAccount(123456, \"John Doe\", 1000.0);\n\n    myAccount.displayBalance();\n    myAccount.deposit(500.0);\n    myAccount.withdraw(200.0);\n    myAccount.withdraw(1500.0); // This should fail due to insufficient funds\n    myAccount.deposit(-100.0);  // This should be invalid\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a BankAccount class with the required functionalities and demonstrates its usage in the main function. The validations ensure that the account operations are performed correctly and safely.\n\n**Final Solution Code**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nclass BankAccount {\nprivate:\n    int accountNumber;\n    std::string accountHolderName;\n    double balance;\npublic:\n    // Constructor to initialize the account\n    BankAccount(int accNum, const std::string& name, double initialBalance);\n\n    // Function to deposit money\n    void deposit(double amount);\n\n    // Function to withdraw money\n    void withdraw(double amount);\n\n    // Function to display the current balance\n    void displayBalance() const;\n};\n\nBankAccount::BankAccount(int accNum, const std::string& name, double initialBalance)\n    : accountNumber(accNum), accountHolderName(name), balance(initialBalance) {\n    if (initialBalance < 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"Initial balance cannot be negative. Setting balance to zero.\" << std::endl;\n        balance = 0.0;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid BankAccount::deposit(double amount) {\n    if (amount < 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"Deposit amount cannot be negative.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        balance += amount;\n        std::cout << \"Deposited: \" << amount << \". New balance: \" << balance << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid BankAccount::withdraw(double amount) {\n    if (amount < 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.\" << std::endl;\n    } else if (amount > balance) {\n        std::cerr << \"Insufficient funds. Cannot withdraw \" << amount << \".\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        balance -= amount;\n        std::cout << \"Withdrew: \" << amount << \". New balance: \" << balance << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid BankAccount::displayBalance() const {\n    std::cout << \"Current balance: \" << balance << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    BankAccount myAccount(123456, \"John Doe\", 1000.0);\n\n    myAccount.displayBalance();\n    myAccount.deposit(500.0);\n    myAccount.withdraw(200.0);\n    myAccount.withdraw(1500.0); // This should fail due to insufficient funds\n    myAccount.deposit(-100.0);  // This should be invalid\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- **Class Definition:** The `BankAccount` class encapsulates the account number, holder's name, and balance as private members to ensure data integrity.\n- **Constructor:** Initializes the account with provided account number, holder's name, and initial balance. It also checks if the initial balance is negative and sets it to zero if true.\n- **deposit Function:** Adds the deposit amount to the balance if the amount is positive; otherwise, it logs an error.\n- **withdraw Function:** Subtracts the withdrawal amount from the balance if the amount is positive and sufficient funds are available; otherwise, it logs an error.\n- **displayBalance Function:** Outputs the current balance.\n- **Main Function:** Demonstrates creating a `BankAccount` object and performing deposit, withdrawal, and balance display operations, including error cases."
