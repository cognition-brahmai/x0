        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that travels between two cities: first at 60 mph and then returns at 40 mph because of bad weather. We need to find the average speed for the entire round trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance between the two cities is \\( d \\) miles. That means the round trip distance is \\( 2d \\) miles.\n\nNow, for the trip to the first city, the train travels at 60 mph, so the time taken for that part is \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours.\n\nOn the return trip, the train travels at 40 mph, so the time taken for that part is \\( \\frac{d}{40} \\) hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time for the round trip is \\( \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{40} \\).\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120, so:\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{2d}{120} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{40} = \\frac{3d}{120} \\)\n\nAdding them up: \\( \\frac{2d}{120} + \\frac{3d}{120} = \\frac{5d}{120} = \\frac{d}{24} \\) hours.\n\nNow, the total distance is \\( 2d \\) miles, and the total time is \\( \\frac{d}{24} \\) hours.\n\nSo, the average speed is \\( \\frac{total distance}{total time} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \\times \\frac{24}{d} = 48 \\) mph.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But I recall that average speed for a round trip isn't simply the arithmetic mean of the two speeds. In fact, it's the harmonic mean, which makes sense because we're dealing with rates and times.\n\nLet me verify this with the formula for the harmonic mean of two speeds: \\( \\frac{2ab}{a + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the two speeds.\n\nPlugging in \\( a = 60 \\) mph and \\( b = 40 \\) mph:\n\n\\( \\frac{2 \\times 60 \\times 40}{60 + 40} = \\frac{4800}{100} = 48 \\) mph.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed for the entire round trip is 48 mph.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider an example with actual distances. Suppose the distance between the two cities is 120 miles.\n\nThen, the total distance for the round trip is \\( 2 \\times 120 = 240 \\) miles.\n\nTime to first city: \\( \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\) hours.\n\nTime to return: \\( \\frac{120}{40} = 3 \\) hours.\n\nTotal time: \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\) hours.\n\nAverage speed: \\( \\frac{240}{5} = 48 \\) mph.\n\nSame answer again. So, I'm confident that 48 mph is the correct average speed for the entire round trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
