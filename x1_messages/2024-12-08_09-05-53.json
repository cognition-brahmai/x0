        "content": "So, the company has 120 employees in total. Out of these, 60% are full-time workers, and the remaining are part-time workers. I need to find out how many part-time workers there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many full-time workers there are. Since 60% of the employees are full-time, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 120.\n\nTo calculate 60% of 120, I can use the formula:\n\nFull-time workers = (60/100) * 120\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n60 divided by 100 is 0.6.\n\nThen, 0.6 multiplied by 120 is 72.\n\nSo, there are 72 full-time workers.\n\nNow, to find the number of part-time workers, I can subtract the number of full-time workers from the total number of employees.\n\nPart-time workers = Total employees - Full-time workers\n\nPart-time workers = 120 - 72\n\nPart-time workers = 48\n\nTherefore, the company has 48 part-time workers.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by calculating the percentage of part-time workers directly.\n\nSince 60% are full-time, the remaining percentage must be part-time. So, part-time workers would be 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nThen, I can calculate 40% of 120 to find the number of part-time workers.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n40% of 120 is (40/100) * 120\n\n40 divided by 100 is 0.4.\n\n0.4 multiplied by 120 is 48.\n\nAgain, I get 48 part-time workers.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. It confirms that 48 is the correct number of part-time workers.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also check if the sum of full-time and part-time workers equals the total number of employees.\n\nFull-time workers: 72\n\nPart-time workers: 48\n\nTotal: 72 + 48 = 120\n\nYes, it matches the total number of employees given.\n\nSo, the company has 48 part-time workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
