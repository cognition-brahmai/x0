        "content": "To calculate the future value of an investment with compound interest, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ A = P \\times (1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{n \\times t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- \\( P = \\$100,000 \\)\n\n- \\( r = 5\\% = 0.05 \\)\n\n- \\( n = 1 \\) (since the interest is compounded annually)\n\n- \\( t = 7 \\) years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\times (1 + \\frac{0.05}{1})^{1 \\times 7} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\times (1 + 0.05)^7 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\times (1.05)^7 \\]\n\nNow, calculating \\( (1.05)^7 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.05)^7 \\approx 1.4071006 \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ A \\approx 100,000 \\times 1.4071006 \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 140,710.06 \\]\n\nSo, after 7 years, the investment will be worth approximately \\$140,710.06.\n\n**Alternative Method Using Compound Interest Table or Calculator:**\n\nIf you have access to a compound interest table or a financial calculator, you can find the future value factor for 5% over 7 years, which is approximately 1.4071, and then multiply it by the principal amount (\\$100,000) to get the same result.\n\n**Understanding Compound Interest:**\n\nCompound interest allows your investment to grow exponentially over time because you earn interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. This is different from simple interest, where interest is only earned on the initial principal.\n\nIn this case, with annual compounding, the interest is added to the principal at the end of each year, and the next year's interest is calculated on this new amount.\n\n**Year-by-Year Breakdown:**\n\nTo illustrate, here's a year-by-year breakdown of the investment growth:\n\n- **Year 0:** \\$100,000\n\n- **Year 1:** \\$100,000 + (0.05 \u00d7 \\$100,000) = \\$105,000\n\n- **Year 2:** \\$105,000 + (0.05 \u00d7 \\$105,000) = \\$110,250\n\n- **Year 3:** \\$110,250 + (0.05 \u00d7 \\$110,250) = \\$115,762.50\n\n- **Year 4:** \\$115,762.50 + (0.05 \u00d7 \\$115,762.50) = \\$121,550.63\n\n- **Year 5:** \\$121,550.63 + (0.05 \u00d7 \\$121,550.63) = \\$127,628.16\n\n- **Year 6:** \\$127,628.16 + (0.05 \u00d7 \\$127,628.16) = \\$134,009.57\n\n- **Year 7:** \\$134,009.57 + (0.05 \u00d7 \\$134,009.57) = \\$140,710.05\n\nAs you can see, the investment grows each year based on the previous year's balance.\n\n**Comparing to Simple Interest:**\n\nFor comparison, if the interest were simple (not compounded), the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ A = P + (P \\times r \\times t) \\]\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 + (100,000 \\times 0.05 \\times 7) \\]\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 + 35,000 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 135,000 \\]\n\nSo, with compound interest, the investment grows to \\$140,710.06, whereas with simple interest, it would only grow to \\$135,000. This demonstrates the power of compounding over time.\n\n**Impact of Compounding Frequency:**\n\nIt's worth noting that the more frequently interest is compounded, the higher the final amount will be, up to a certain point. For example, if the interest were compounded semi-annually or monthly, the final amount would be slightly higher than with annual compounding.\n\nHowever, in this specific scenario, since the interest is compounded annually, we use \\( n = 1 \\).\n\n**Formula Adjustments for Different Compounding Periods:**\n\n- **Compounded Semi-Annually:** \\( n = 2 \\)\n\n- **Compounded Quarterly:** \\( n = 4 \\)\n\n- **Compounded Monthly:** \\( n = 12 \\)\n\n- **Compounded Daily:** \\( n = 365 \\)\n\nFor instance, if the interest were compounded monthly, the formula would be:\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 7} \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 100,000 \\times (1.0041667)^{84} \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 100,000 \\times 1.418334 \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 141,833.40 \\]\n\nAs you can see, monthly compounding results in a slightly higher amount compared to annual compounding.\n\n**Continuous Compounding:**\n\nIn some cases, interest can be compounded continuously. The formula for continuous compounding is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\times e^{r \\times t} \\]\n\nWhere \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828.\n\nUsing the same values:\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\times e^{0.05 \\times 7} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 100,000 \\times e^{0.35} \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 100,000 \\times 1.4190675 \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 141,906.75 \\]\n\nContinuous compounding yields a slightly higher amount than discrete compounding periods.\n\n**Practical Implications:**\n\nUnderstanding how compound interest works is crucial for making informed financial decisions. It can help in planning investments, saving for retirement, or taking out loans.\n\nIn investments, the power of compounding can significantly increase wealth over time, especially when starting early. For example, investing in retirement accounts that offer compound interest can lead to substantial savings by retirement age.\n\nConversely, in borrowing, compound interest can cause\u503a\u52a1 to grow rapidly if not managed properly. This is why it's important to understand the terms of any loan and to make timely payments to avoid excessive interest charges.\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nCompound interest is not only applicable to investments and loans but also in various other financial products such as savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and more.\n\nFor instance, if you have a savings account with a bank that offers compound interest, your savings will grow over time based on the compounding frequency and the interest rate.\n\nSimilarly, in business, compound interest principles are used in calculating the net present value (NPV) of future cash flows, which is essential for investment appraisal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the future value of a \\$100,000 investment with an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded annually over 7 years, is approximately \\$140,710.06. This calculation demonstrates the power of compound interest in growing investments over time. Understanding and utilizing compound interest can be a valuable tool in achieving financial goals."
