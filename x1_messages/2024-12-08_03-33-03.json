        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: There are 6 black socks and 4 white socks in a box, making a total of 10 socks. I need to find the probability of picking two socks that match, meaning both are black or both are white, without looking.\n\nFirst, I think I should recall the basic formula for probability, which is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the pairs of socks that match, either both black or both white, and the total possible outcomes are all possible pairs of socks I can pick from the box.\n\nTo find the total number of possible pairs, I can use combinations because the order in which I pick the socks doesn't matter. The number of ways to choose 2 socks out of 10 is denoted as \"10 choose 2\", which is calculated as 10! divided by (2! times (10-2)!). Simplifying that, it's (10 times 9)/2 = 45 possible pairs.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, I need to find the number of ways to pick 2 black socks plus the number of ways to pick 2 white socks.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to pick 2 black socks from 6 black socks is \"6 choose 2\", which is (6 times 5)/2 = 15.\n\nNext, the number of ways to pick 2 white socks from 4 white socks is \"4 choose 2\", which is (4 times 3)/2 = 6.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is 15 + 6 = 21.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a matching pair is 21/45. I can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3, which gives 7/15.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using probabilities step by step instead of combinations.\n\nLet's try that. The probability of picking two matching socks can be thought of as the probability of picking two black socks plus the probability of picking two white socks.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a black sock on the first draw. There are 6 black socks out of 10, so that's 6/10 or 3/5.\n\nGiven that the first sock is black, the probability that the second sock is also black is 5/9, because there are now 5 black socks left out of 9 total socks.\n\nSo, the probability of both socks being black is (3/5) times (5/9) = 15/45 = 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a white sock first is 4/10 or 2/5.\n\nGiven that the first sock is white, the probability that the second sock is also white is 3/9 = 1/3.\n\nSo, the probability of both socks being white is (2/5) times (1/3) = 2/15.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of getting a matching pair is (1/3) + (2/15). To add those, I need a common denominator, which is 15. So, 1/3 is 5/15, plus 2/15 is 7/15.\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier result from using combinations. So, the probability is 7/15.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it another way. What's the probability of getting two socks of different colors? And then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of matching pairs.\n\nThe probability of picking one black and one white sock. Well, there are two scenarios for that: black first and white second, or white first and black second.\n\nFirst, black then white: (6/10) * (4/9) = 24/90.\n\nWhite then black: (4/10) * (6/9) = 24/90.\n\nSo, total probability of getting a mismatching pair is 24/90 + 24/90 = 48/90, which simplifies to 16/30 or 8/15.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting a matching pair is 1 - 8/15 = 7/15.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, I think 7/15 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations again. The total number of ways to pick 2 socks from 10 is 45, as before.\n\nThe number of matching pairs is 21, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, probability is 21/45 = 7/15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of conditional probability. The probability that the second sock matches the first one.\n\nSo, the probability that the second sock is the same color as the first one.\n\nLet me denote B for black and W for white.\n\nP(matching) = P(both B) + P(both W).\n\nP(both B) = P(first B) * P(second B | first B) = (6/10)*(5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3.\n\nP(both W) = P(first W) * P(second W | first W) = (4/10)*(3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15.\n\nTotal P(matching) = 1/3 + 2/15 = 7/15.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlternatively, P(second sock matches the first) = P(second is B | first is B) * P(first is B) + P(second is W | first is W) * P(first is W).\n\nWhich is (5/9)*(6/10) + (3/9)*(4/10) = (30/90) + (12/90) = 42/90 = 7/15.\n\nAgain, confirming the same answer.\n\nI think it's solid. The probability is 7/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{15}} \\]"
