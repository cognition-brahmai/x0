        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 8 friends who went out for dinner and they ordered some pizzas, burgers, and sandwiches. I need to find out how much each person has to pay if they split the bill equally.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total cost of all the items they ordered. They ordered 5 pizzas, and each pizza costs $10. So, the total cost for pizzas would be 5 times $10, which is $50.\n\nNext, they ordered 6 burgers, and each burger costs $5. So, the total cost for burgers would be 6 times $5, which is $30.\n\nThen, they ordered 7 sandwiches, and each sandwich costs $3. So, the total cost for sandwiches would be 7 times $3, which is $21.\n\nNow, I need to add up all these amounts to get the total bill. That would be $50 for pizzas plus $30 for burgers plus $21 for sandwiches. Let's add those up: $50 + $30 is $80, and then $80 + $21 is $101.\n\nSo, the total bill is $101.\n\nNow, this bill needs to be split equally among 8 people. To find out how much each person has to pay, I need to divide the total bill by the number of people.\n\nSo, $101 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 101 divided by 8 is 12.625.\n\nSo, each person has to pay $12.625.\n\nBut it's not common to deal with fractions of a cent in cash, so maybe we should round it to the nearest cent.\n\n$12.625 rounded to the nearest cent is $12.63.\n\nWait a minute, but 8 times $12.63 is $101.04, which is 3 cents more than the total bill. Alternatively, if each person pays $12.62, the total would be $100.96, which is 4 cents less than the total bill.\n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy here because of the rounding.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to have each person pay $12.63, and then one person pays a little less to make up for the total.\n\nBut that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to not worry about the rounding and just accept that each person pays $12.63, and the extra 3 cents is somehow absorbed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total comes out evenly, and I'm making a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the total cost.\n\n5 pizzas at $10 each: 5 * 10 = $50\n\n6 burgers at $5 each: 6 * 5 = $30\n\n7 sandwiches at $3 each: 7 * 3 = $21\n\nTotal: $50 + $30 + $21 = $101\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, dividing $101 by 8.\n\nLet me do the division again: 8 goes into 101 a total of 12 times (since 8*12=96), with a remainder of 5.\n\nSo, 101 divided by 8 is 12 with a remainder of 5, which is 12 and 5/8 dollars.\n\n5/8 of a dollar is $0.625.\n\nSo, $12.625.\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, it's $12.63.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, 8 * $12.63 = $101.04, which is 3 cents more than the total bill.\n\nAlternatively, 8 * $12.62 = $100.96, which is 4 cents less.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to have each person pay $12.63, and then have one person pay a little less to make up for the total.\n\nBut that might be too complicated for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to express the answer in decimal form, accepting that it's $12.63, and the slight discrepancy is negligible.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with each person paying $12.63.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12.63} \\]"
