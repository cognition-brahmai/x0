        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are two boxes, Box A and Box B, each containing apples and oranges. Box A has 10 apples and 30 oranges, and Box B has 20 apples and 40 oranges. The task is to find the probability that if I pick one fruit from each box, both of them are apples.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nIn this case, I'm picking one fruit from each box, and I want both to be apples.\n\nLet me consider each box separately.\n\nFor Box A:\n\n- Total fruits in Box A = 10 apples + 30 oranges = 40 fruits\n\n- Probability of picking an apple from Box A = Number of apples in A / Total fruits in A = 10/40 = 1/4\n\nFor Box B:\n\n- Total fruits in Box B = 20 apples + 40 oranges = 60 fruits\n\n- Probability of picking an apple from Box B = Number of apples in B / Total fruits in B = 20/60 = 1/3\n\nNow, since these are independent events\u2014meaning what I pick from Box A doesn't affect what I pick from Box B\u2014I can find the probability of both events happening by multiplying their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability that both fruits are apples should be:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{both apples}) = P(\\text{apple from A}) \\times P(\\text{apple from B}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{12} \\]\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total number of ways to pick one fruit from each box and the number of ways to pick two apples.\n\nTotal ways to pick one fruit from Box A and one from Box B:\n\n- Total from A = 40\n\n- Total from B = 60\n\n- Total combinations = 40 \u00d7 60 = 2400\n\nNumber of ways to pick an apple from A and an apple from B:\n\n- Apples from A = 10\n\n- Apples from B = 20\n\n- Favorable combinations = 10 \u00d7 20 = 200\n\nTherefore, probability = favorable / total = 200 / 2400 = 1/12\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using combinations or other probability rules.\n\nWell, since the events are independent, multiplying the probabilities is the straightforward way.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the general formula for the probability of two events occurring together.\n\nIf A and B are two events, then:\n\n\\[ P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A) \\]\n\nWhere P(B|A) is the probability of B given that A has occurred.\n\nIn this case, since the picks are independent, P(B|A) = P(B), so it simplifies to:\n\n\\[ P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\]\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nWait, but what if the picks were not independent? For example, if I was picking from the same box twice without replacement, then the probabilities would change. But in this case, it's two separate boxes, so they are independent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the probability step by step.\n\nFirst, pick from Box A:\n\n- Probability of apple: 10/40 = 1/4\n\nThen, pick from Box B:\n\n- Probability of apple: 20/60 = 1/3\n\nSince these are sequential independent events, multiply the probabilities:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{12} \\]\n\nSame answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Are there any dependencies between the boxes? The problem says \"randomly pick one fruit from each box,\" so I think they're truly independent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of combinations.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one apple from A: C(10,1) = 10\n\nNumber of ways to pick one apple from B: C(20,1) = 20\n\nTotal number of ways to pick one fruit from A and one from B: C(40,1) \u00d7 C(60,1) = 40 \u00d7 60 = 2400\n\nSo, probability = (10 \u00d7 20) / (40 \u00d7 60) = 200 / 2400 = 1/12\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The probability that both fruits are apples is 1/12.\n\nJust to be comprehensive, maybe I can find the probabilities of other outcomes to see if they make sense.\n\nFor example, probability that both are oranges.\n\nFor Box A:\n\n- Probability of orange = 30/40 = 3/4\n\nFor Box B:\n\n- Probability of orange = 40/60 = 2/3\n\nSo, probability both are oranges:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nProbability that first is apple and second is orange:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nProbability that first is orange and second is apple:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nAdding all these up:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nLet's see:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{12}{12} = 1 \\]\n\nPerfect, it all adds up to 1, which makes sense because these are all possible mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the probability that both fruits are apples is indeed 1/12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}} \\]"
