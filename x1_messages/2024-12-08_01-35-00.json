        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces widgets in batches of either 5 or 7. At the end of the day, they've produced a total of 53 widgets. We need to figure out how many batches of 5 and how many batches of 7 were produced to reach that total.\n\nFirst, let's define our variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- \\(x\\) is the number of batches of 5 widgets.\n\n- \\(y\\) is the number of batches of 7 widgets.\n\nSo, the total number of widgets can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\[5x + 7y = 53\\]\n\nOur goal is to find non-negative integer values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy this equation, because you can't have a negative number of batches.\n\nThis looks like a linear Diophantine equation, which means we're looking for integer solutions. To solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we can use a method of trial and error, but I'll try to be systematic about it.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for one variable in terms of the other. I'll solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[5x = 53 - 7y\\]\\[x = \\frac{53 - 7y}{5}\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) must be an integer, \\(53 - 7y\\) must be divisible by 5. That means \\(53 - 7y\\) should be a multiple of 5.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the possible values of \\(y\\) that make \\(53 - 7y\\) divisible by 5. Since \\(y\\) represents the number of batches of 7, it has to be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet\u2019s try different integer values for \\(y\\) and see if \\(x\\) comes out as an integer.\n\nStarting with \\(y = 0\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{53 - 7(0)}{5} = \\frac{53}{5} = 10.6\\]\n\nThat's not an integer, so \\(y = 0\\) doesn't work.\n\nNext, \\(y = 1\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{53 - 7(1)}{5} = \\frac{53 - 7}{5} = \\frac{46}{5} = 9.2\\]\n\nStill not an integer.\n\n\\(y = 2\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{53 - 14}{5} = \\frac{39}{5} = 7.8\\]\n\nNot an integer.\n\n\\(y = 3\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{53 - 21}{5} = \\frac{32}{5} = 6.4\\]\n\nNot an integer.\n\n\\(y = 4\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{53 - 28}{5} = \\frac{25}{5} = 5\\]\n\nHey, that's an integer! So one possible solution is \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 4\\).\n\nLet\u2019s check if there are other possible solutions by trying \\(y = 5\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{53 - 35}{5} = \\frac{18}{5} = 3.6\\]\n\nNot an integer.\n\n\\(y = 6\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{53 - 42}{5} = \\frac{11}{5} = 2.2\\]\n\nNot an integer.\n\n\\(y = 7\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{53 - 49}{5} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8\\]\n\nNot an integer.\n\n\\(y = 8\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{53 - 56}{5} = \\frac{-3}{5} = -0.6\\]\n\nNegative, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, the only solution where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are non-negative integers is \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 4\\).\n\nLet\u2019s double-check this solution to make sure it adds up to 53 widgets.\n\nBatches of 5: 5 batches \u00d7 5 widgets/batch = 25 widgets\n\nBatches of 7: 4 batches \u00d7 7 widgets/batch = 28 widgets\n\nTotal widgets: 25 + 28 = 53\n\nPerfect, that matches the total given.\n\nTherefore, the factory produced 5 batches of 5 widgets and 4 batches of 7 widgets to reach a total of 53 widgets in a day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ batches of 5 widgets and } 4 \\text{ batches of 7 widgets}} \\]"
