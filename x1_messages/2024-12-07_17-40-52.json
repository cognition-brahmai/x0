        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces 500 units of a product every day. Out of these, 2% are defective. We need to find out how many non-defective products are produced in 30 days, considering that all defective products are discarded and not sold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 2% defective means. If the factory produces 500 units daily and 2% of them are defective, then the number of defective units per day would be 2% of 500. Let me calculate that:\n\nDefective units per day = 2% of 500\n                          = (2/100) * 500\n                          = 0.02 * 500\n                          = 10 units\n\nSo, every day, 10 units are defective.\n\nNext, since all defective products are discarded, the number of non-defective units produced each day would be the total units produced minus the defective units.\n\nNon-defective units per day = Total units per day - Defective units per day\n                             = 500 - 10\n                             = 490 units\n\nNow, we need to find out how many non-defective units are produced in 30 days. Since the factory produces 490 non-defective units each day, over 30 days, the total would be:\n\nTotal non-defective units in 30 days = 490 units/day * 30 days\n                                      = 14,700 units\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since 2% of the products are defective, that means 98% are non-defective. So, instead of subtracting the defective units, I could directly calculate 98% of the daily production to find the non-defective units.\n\nNon-defective units per day = 98% of 500\n                             = (98/100) * 500\n                             = 0.98 * 500\n                             = 490 units\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, daily non-defective production is indeed 490 units.\n\nNow, multiplying that by 30 days:\n\nTotal non-defective units in 30 days = 490 * 30\n                                      = 14,700 units\n\nLet me just make sure there are no other factors to consider. The problem says \"all defective products are discarded and not sold,\" so we don't need to account for any defective units in the final count. Also, the production rate is constant at 500 units per day, with a consistent defective rate of 2%, over the 30-day period.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider holidays, machine breakdowns, or other variables, as the problem doesn't mention any. So, assuming the factory operates every day for 30 days, producing 500 units each day, with 2% defectives, the total non-defective production would be 14,700 units.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the defective rate could vary or if there's any other interpretation, but based on the information given, this seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 14,700 non-defective products produced in 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14700} \\]"
