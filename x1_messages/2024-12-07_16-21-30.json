        "content": "So there's this game where 100 people take turns saying numbers in order, starting from 1. If someone says a number that's divisible by 7 or has a 7 in it, they're out. You want to know which position you should pick to make sure you don't get eliminated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules clearly. People say numbers in sequence: 1, 2, 3, and so on. If the number is divisible by 7 or contains the digit 7, that person is eliminated.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- 7 is divisible by 7, so the person saying 7 is out.\n\n- 14 is divisible by 7, so that person is out.\n\n- 17 contains a 7, so that person is out.\n\n- 27 contains a 7, so out.\n\n- And so on.\n\nThe goal is to pick a position among the 100 players where you'll say a number that's not eliminated.\n\nTo ensure you won't be eliminated, you need to pick a position that corresponds to a number which is neither divisible by 7 nor contains the digit 7.\n\nSo, I need to find out how many numbers from 1 to 100 are eliminated based on these rules, and then determine which positions are safe.\n\nLet me first find out how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 7 or contain the digit 7.\n\nFirst, numbers divisible by 7:\n\n7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98.\n\nThat's 14 numbers.\n\nNext, numbers that contain the digit 7 but are not already counted in the divisible by 7 list.\n\nLooking at numbers from 1 to 100:\n\n- 7, 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 70, 77, 87, 97.\n\nWait, but some of these are already in the divisible by 7 list, like 7, 21, 35, 70, 77, etc.\n\nSo, let's list all numbers containing the digit 7:\n\n7, 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 70, 77, 87, 97.\n\nNow, subtract those already counted in divisible by 7:\n\n7, 70, 77 are already counted.\n\nSo, additional numbers to consider: 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 87, 97.\n\nThat's 8 more numbers.\n\nTherefore, total eliminated numbers = 14 (divisible by 7) + 8 (contain 7 but not divisible by 7) = 22 numbers.\n\nSo, out of 100 numbers, 22 are eliminated, meaning 78 numbers are safe.\n\nNow, to ensure you won't be eliminated, you need to pick a position that corresponds to one of these 78 safe numbers.\n\nBut the game is played with 100 people, each saying a number in sequence, and those who say an eliminated number are out.\n\nHowever, every time someone is eliminated, the sequence continues with the next person.\n\nWait, no. The sequence is just numbers from 1 to 100, each person says one number, regardless of eliminations.\n\nSo, position 1 says 1, position 2 says 2, ..., position 100 says 100.\n\nBut if a person says a number that's eliminated, they are out.\n\nSo, to ensure you won't be eliminated, you need to pick a position that corresponds to a non-eliminated number.\n\nSo, find the positions (numbers) that are not eliminated.\n\nWe already know there are 78 safe numbers.\n\nSo, positions 1 to 100, but only 78 are safe.\n\nSo, you should pick one of those 78 positions.\n\nBut the question is: which position should you choose to ensure you won't be eliminated?\n\nWell, any position that corresponds to a non-eliminated number.\n\nSo, basically, pick a number between 1 and 100 that is not divisible by 7 and does not contain the digit 7.\n\nLet me list some of them to see the pattern.\n\nNumbers to eliminate:\n\nDivisible by 7: 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77,84,91,98.\n\nContains digit 7 but not divisible by 7: 17,27,37,47,57,67,87,97.\n\nSo, safe numbers are all other numbers from 1 to 100 not in this list.\n\nFor example:\n\n1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,18,19,20,22,23,24,25,26,29,30,31,32,33,34,36,38,39,40,41,43,44,45,46,48,50,51,52,53,54,55,58,59,60,61,62,64,65,66,68,69,80,81,82,83,85,86,88,89,90,92,93,94,95,96,99,100.\n\nThat's 78 numbers.\n\nSo, you can pick any of these positions to ensure you won't be eliminated.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking for a specific position that guarantees safety, considering the sequence of eliminations.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that as people are eliminated, the sequence might change.\n\nBut according to the initial description, people take turns saying numbers in ascending order, starting from 1, regardless of eliminations.\n\nMeaning, even if someone is eliminated, the next person still says the next number in sequence.\n\nSo, position 1 says 1, position 2 says 2, ..., position 100 says 100.\n\nEliminations happen based on the number said, but the sequence continues without skipping numbers.\n\nTherefore, to ensure you won't be eliminated, you need to pick a position that corresponds to a number not divisible by 7 and does not contain the digit 7.\n\nSo, any of the 78 positions corresponding to safe numbers.\n\nBut perhaps there's a specific position that is safest or has some advantage.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the order of elimination and wanting to be in a position that is called later, after many have been eliminated.\n\nBut according to the rules, everyone says their number in order, and those who say an eliminated number are out.\n\nBut the sequence continues fully from 1 to 100, regardless of eliminations.\n\nSo, it's not like the game progresses with fewer people; everyone says their number in turn, and eliminations are determined based on the number said.\n\nTherefore, to ensure you're not eliminated, pick a position with a safe number.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about the Josephus problem or some similar elimination game where positions affect survival.\n\nHowever, in this case, it's not about positions affecting survival in that way; it's about the number said being eliminated based on specific criteria.\n\nSo, to guarantee you won't be eliminated, choose a position that says a number not divisible by 7 and does not contain the digit 7.\n\nTherefore, any position corresponding to a safe number is fine.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking for a specific position, like the last safe position or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about choosing a position that is least likely to be eliminated, but since it's deterministic, not probabilistic.\n\nWait, but in this setup, it's completely deterministic; some positions are safe, some aren't.\n\nSo, to ensure you won't be eliminated, choose any safe position.\n\nBut maybe the question is about strategic choice in a competitive setting, where you want to choose a position that maximizes your chances or has some advantage.\n\nHowever, given the rules provided, there's no additional strategy beyond choosing a safe position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game continues in rounds, but the description doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven the information provided, the answer is to choose any position corresponding to a number that is not divisible by 7 and does not contain the digit 7.\n\nSo, for example, position 1, saying 1, is safe.\n\nPosition 2, saying 2, is safe.\n\nPosition 7, saying 7, is eliminated.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTherefore, to ensure you won't be eliminated, choose positions like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc., avoiding the eliminated numbers.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern or a specific position that is advantageously placed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about finding the position that corresponds to the last safe number.\n\nBut the game doesn't seem to have a progressing elimination round; it's just a single pass through the numbers from 1 to 100, eliminating based on the criteria.\n\nSo, in that case, choosing any safe position ensures you won't be eliminated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game continues with the remaining players after the first round, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven the information, I'll assume it's a single pass through the numbers from 1 to 100, and you just need to choose a position that says a safe number.\n\nTherefore, any of the 78 positions corresponding to safe numbers will do.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it.\n\nWait, maybe the game continues with the remaining players, and numbers are continued to be said beyond 100, but the problem specifies 100 people saying numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nSo, I think it's a single pass from 1 to 100, with eliminations based on the specified criteria.\n\nTherefore, to ensure you won't be eliminated, choose a position that says a number not divisible by 7 and does not contain the digit 7.\n\nHence, positions 1 through 100, excluding those that say eliminated numbers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, choose any position that corresponds to a safe number.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking for a specific position number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about understanding the pattern of eliminated numbers.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern.\n\nNumbers eliminated are those divisible by 7 or containing the digit 7.\n\nSo, in the sequence from 1 to 100:\n\n- Multiples of 7: 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77,84,91,98.\n\n- Numbers containing 7 but not multiples of 7: 17,27,37,47,57,67,87,97.\n\nTotal eliminated: 14 + 8 = 22.\n\nSo, 78 safe positions.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find a position that is always safe, or a position that corresponds to a number that is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the Josephus problem, where people are eliminated in a circle, and there's a specific position that survives.\n\nBut in this case, it's not a circular elimination; it's just a linear sequence from 1 to 100, with eliminations based on the number properties.\n\nTherefore, to ensure you won't be eliminated, choose any position that says a number not divisible by 7 and does not contain the digit 7.\n\nSo, for example, position 1 is safe, position 2 is safe, position 7 is eliminated, position 8 is safe, and so on.\n\nTherefore, any position corresponding to a safe number is fine.\n\nBut perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n\"A group of people are playing a game where they take turns saying numbers in ascending order. The first person says \"1,\" the second person says \"2,\" and so on. When someone says a number that is divisible by 7 or contains the digit 7, they are eliminated from the game. If there are 100 people playing, which position should you choose to ensure you won't be eliminated?\"\n\nSo, it seems that the sequence is from 1 to 100, each person saying one number, and those who say a number divisible by 7 or containing the digit 7 are eliminated.\n\nTherefore, to ensure you won't be eliminated, choose a position that says a number not meeting those criteria.\n\nHence, any position corresponding to a safe number is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the intent is to find the position that corresponds to the highest safe number, or the last safe position.\n\nBut even then, it's just choosing a position that says a safe number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about understanding the sequence and ensuring you're not in a position that says an eliminated number.\n\nGiven that, the answer is to choose any position that says a safe number.\n\nBut perhaps there's a specific position that is advantageous in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the game continues beyond 100, but the problem specifies 100 people saying numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is to choose any position corresponding to a safe number.\n\nFor example, position 1 is safe, position 2 is safe, position 3 is safe, and so on, avoiding positions that say eliminated numbers like 7,14,21,27, etc.\n\nTherefore, to ensure you won't be eliminated, choose a position that says a number not divisible by 7 and does not contain the digit 7.\n\nHence, positions 1 through 100, excluding those that say eliminated numbers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, choose any position corresponding to a safe number.\n\nBut perhaps the question is looking for a specific position number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about understanding the pattern of safe positions.\n\nLet me try to list the safe positions:\n\nPositions saying numbers not divisible by 7 and not containing the digit 7.\n\nSo, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,18,19,20,22,23,24,25,26,29,30,31,32,33,34,36,38,39,40,41,43,44,45,46,48,50,51,52,53,54,55,58,59,60,61,62,64,65,66,68,69,80,81,82,83,85,86,88,89,90,92,93,94,95,96,99,100.\n\nThat's a total of 78 positions.\n\nSo, you can choose any of these 78 positions to ensure you won't be eliminated.\n\nBut perhaps there's a specific position that is considered the best or has some advantage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about understanding the sequence and choosing the position that corresponds to the highest safe number.\n\nBut even then, position 100 is safe, as 100 is not divisible by 7 and does not contain the digit 7.\n\nTherefore, position 100 is a safe position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game continues beyond 100, but the problem specifies 100 people saying numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nTherefore, position 100 is safe, and you can choose that position to ensure you won't be eliminated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first person has an advantage or disadvantage.\n\nBut in this case, since the elimination is based on the number said, not on the position per se, except insofar as the position corresponds to the number said.\n\nTherefore, to ensure you won't be eliminated, choose position 100, which says 100, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, any of the 78 safe positions would work.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about choosing the position that is least likely to be eliminated, but since it's deterministic, not probabilistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about choosing a position that is later in the sequence, after many have been eliminated.\n\nBut given that eliminations don't affect the sequence of numbers being said, as the sequence continues from 1 to 100 regardless of eliminations.\n\nTherefore, choosing any safe position ensures you won't be eliminated.\n\nHence, position 100 is a safe choice.\n\nSo, the answer is to choose position 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]"
