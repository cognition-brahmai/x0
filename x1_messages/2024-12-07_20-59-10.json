        "content": "Let's see. So, the tree produces 20 apples in the first year, and each year after that, it doubles its production from the previous year. I need to find out how many apples it will produce in five years total. Okay, so I should probably calculate the production for each year and then add them up.\n\nFirst year: 20 apples.\n\nSecond year: double of the first year, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 apples.\n\nThird year: double of the second year, so 40 times 2, which is 80 apples.\n\nFourth year: double of the third year, so 80 times 2, which is 160 apples.\n\nFifth year: double of the fourth year, so 160 times 2, which is 320 apples.\n\nNow, I need to add all these up to get the total production over five years.\n\n20 + 40 + 80 + 160 + 320.\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n20 + 40 = 60\n\n60 + 80 = 140\n\n140 + 160 = 300\n\n300 + 320 = 620.\n\nSo, the tree will produce a total of 620 apples in five years.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to calculate this without adding each year's production separately? I think there might be a formula for this since it's doubling each year, which means it's a geometric sequence.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, the sum S of the first n terms where each term is multiplied by a common ratio r can be calculated using the formula:\n\nS = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nwhere:\n\n- a is the first term,\n\n- r is the common ratio,\n\n- n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- a = 20 (first year's production),\n\n- r = 2 (since it doubles each year),\n\n- n = 5 (five years).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nS = 20 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1)\n\nFirst, calculate 2^5:\n\n2^5 = 32\n\nThen, 32 - 1 = 31\n\nAnd 2 - 1 = 1\n\nSo, S = 20 * 31 / 1 = 20 * 31 = 620\n\nOkay, that matches the total I calculated earlier by adding each year's production separately. Good, that makes sense.\n\nI think both methods are valid, but using the geometric series formula might be faster, especially for larger numbers of years.\n\nLet me just double-check the formula to make sure I'm using it correctly.\n\nThe general formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is:\n\nS_n = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), for r \u2260 1\n\nIn this case, r = 2, which is greater than 1, so the formula applies.\n\nAlternatively, for r = 1, the sum would be S_n = a * n, but since r is not 1, we use the formula above.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the tree doubled its production but started with a different number or had a different multiplier.\n\nFor example, if the tree produced 10 apples in the first year and doubled each year for five years:\n\nS = 10 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 10 * (32 - 1) / 1 = 10 * 31 = 310 apples.\n\nOr, if it tripled its production each year, with 20 apples in the first year:\n\nS = 20 * (3^5 - 1) / (3 - 1) = 20 * (243 - 1) / 2 = 20 * 242 / 2 = 20 * 121 = 2420 apples.\n\nYes, the formula seems consistent.\n\nBack to the original problem: 20 apples first year, doubling each year for five years, total production is 620 apples.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{620} \\]"
