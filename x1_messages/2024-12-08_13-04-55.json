I think the film you're referring to is \"The Goonies.\" It's a classic from the 1980s where a group of kids go on an adventure to find pirate treasure, led by a map that one of them inherits. They're pursued by a gang of criminals who also want the treasure. It's filled with action, comedy, and a great sense of adventure. Does that sound right?"
