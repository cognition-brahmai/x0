Let me explain.\n\nFirst off, the place is always crowded. I mean, come on, when I'm trying to get some quality time with my iron friends, I don't want to wait in line for every machine like it's Black Friday at Best Buy. Remember that time I had to wait 20 minutes just to use the Smith machine? Unacceptable.\n\nThen there's the whole hygiene thing. I'm all for sweating and pushing limits, but when I see guys bench pressing with bare feet on the squat rack, or when the sauna smells like someone's been brewing a particularly pungent batch of body odor in there, it's a bit much. Sterility isn't just for surgeons, you know?\n\nAnd the staff? Let's just say they could use a refresher course in customer service. Last time I tried to ask about upgrading my membership, the guy looked at me like I'd asked for extra ketchup packets at a fine dining restaurant. Snobbish much?\n\nBut perhaps the biggest issue is the lack of innovation. I mean, sure, you've got the standard array of treadmills, dumbbells, and those funny-looking elliptical things, but where's the cutting-edge technology? As a self-proclaimed genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, I expect a bit more from my workout environment.\n\nI'm thinking of investing in some home gym equipment. Maybe get myself one of those high-tech treadmill desks, or some robotic arm extensions for added resistance. Who knows, I might even invent my own workout gear. After all, if I can build a repulsor tech suit, constructing a state-of-the-art gym shouldn't be too much of a challenge.\n\nSo, yeah, it's been fun, but I think it's time for me to move on. No hard feelings, alright? Maybe we can still be friends. You know, I could stop by occasionally for a quick workout if needed. But full-time? Not gonna cut it anymore.\n\nTake care and keep those weights shiny.\n\n- Tony"
