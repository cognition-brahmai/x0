        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a JavaScript function that takes two arrays of integers and returns both their intersection and union, and both results need to be sorted in ascending order. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find the intersection of two arrays, which means the elements that are common to both arrays. Then, I need to find the union, which is all unique elements from both arrays combined. Finally, both of these resulting arrays should be sorted in ascending order.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For the intersection, I can iterate through one array and check if each element exists in the other array. But that might not be the most efficient way, especially if the arrays are large. A better way might be to use a Set for one array and then filter the other array to include only elements that are in the Set. That should be faster because checking for existence in a Set is generally O(1) time.\n\nFor the union, I need to combine both arrays and remove duplicates. Again, using Sets can be helpful here because Sets automatically handle uniqueness. I can create a Set from both arrays combined and then convert it back to an array.\n\nFinally, I need to sort both the intersection and union arrays in ascending order. In JavaScript, arrays have a sort method that can do this, but I need to make sure to sort numerically, not lexicographically. By default, the sort method sorts strings lexicographically, which would give incorrect order for numbers. So, I need to provide a compare function to sort numerically.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Find the intersection using a Set for one array and filtering the other array.\n\n2. Find the union by combining both arrays into a Set to remove duplicates.\n\n3. Convert both Sets to arrays and sort them numerically.\n\n4. Return both sorted arrays.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as empty arrays or arrays with no common elements.\n\nLet me try to write some pseudocode:\n\nfunction findIntersectionAndUnion(arr1, arr2) {\n\n// Step 1: Find intersection\n\nlet set1 = new Set(arr1);\n\nlet intersection = arr2.filter(item => set1.has(item));\n\n// Step 2: Find union\n\nlet unionSet = new Set([...arr1, ...arr2]);\n\nlet union = Array.from(unionSet);\n\n// Step 3: Sort both arrays numerically\n\nintersection.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\nunion.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n// Step 4: Return both sorted arrays\n\nreturn [intersection, union];\n\n}\n\nThat seems straightforward. But I should test this logic with some examples to make sure it works.\n\nExample 1:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]\n\narr2 = [2, 3, 5]\n\nIntersection should be [2, 3]\n\nUnion should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAfter sorting, intersection is [2, 3] and union is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nExample 2:\n\narr1 = [ ]\n\narr2 = [1, 2, 3]\n\nIntersection should be [ ]\n\nUnion should be [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 3:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 3]\n\narr2 = [4, 5, 6]\n\nIntersection should be [ ]\n\nUnion should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nExample 4:\n\narr1 = [1, 1, 1]\n\narr2 = [1, 2, 3]\n\nIntersection should be [1]\n\nUnion should be [1, 2, 3]\n\nSeems like the logic holds for these cases.\n\nOne thing to note is that in the intersection, we're using arr2.filter(item => set1.has(item)). This will include duplicates if they exist in arr2. But according to the task, we need unique elements in both intersection and union. So, perhaps I should convert the intersection to a Set as well to remove duplicates.\n\nWait, but in the intersection, duplicates are only included if they appear in both arrays. But since we're dealing with integers and the task says \"elements common to both input arrays\", I think it's safe to assume we want unique elements in the intersection as well.\n\nLet me adjust the code to ensure that both intersection and union contain unique elements.\n\nUpdated pseudocode:\n\nfunction findIntersectionAndUnion(arr1, arr2) {\n\n// Convert both arrays to Sets to remove duplicates\n\nlet set1 = new Set(arr1);\n\nlet set2 = new Set(arr2);\n\n// Step 1: Find intersection\n\nlet intersection = [...set1].filter(item => set2.has(item));\n\n// Step 2: Find union\n\nlet union = [...new Set([...set1, ...set2])];\n\n// Step 3: Sort both arrays numerically\n\nintersection.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\nunion.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n// Step 4: Return both sorted arrays\n\nreturn [intersection, union];\n\n}\n\nThis way, both set1 and set2 are Sets without duplicates, and the intersection and union are built from these Sets, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nI should also consider the order of operations. By converting arr1 and arr2 to Sets initially, I avoid duplicates right from the start.\n\nLet me test this updated logic with the earlier examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4] => set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\narr2 = [2, 3, 5] => set2 = {2, 3, 5}\n\nIntersection: [2, 3]\n\nUnion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nSorted correctly.\n\nExample 2:\n\narr1 = [] => set1 = {}\n\narr2 = [1, 2, 3] => set2 = {1, 2, 3}\n\nIntersection: []\n\nUnion: [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 3:\n\narr1 = [1, 2, 3] => set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n\narr2 = [4, 5, 6] => set2 = {4, 5, 6}\n\nIntersection: []\n\nUnion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nExample 4:\n\narr1 = [1, 1, 1] => set1 = {1}\n\narr2 = [1, 2, 3] => set2 = {1, 2, 3}\n\nIntersection: [1]\n\nUnion: [1, 2, 3]\n\nAll look good.\n\nI think this should work. Now, I'll implement this in actual JavaScript code.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that takes two arrays of integers and returns a new array containing their intersection (elements common to both input arrays) and union (all unique elements from both input arrays combined). The resulting arrays should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Intersection**: We use a Set for one array and filter the other array to include only elements that exist in the Set.\n2. **Union**: We combine both arrays into a Set to ensure all elements are unique.\n3. **Sorting**: Convert the Sets to arrays and sort them numerically in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction findIntersectionAndUnion(arr1, arr2) {\n    // Convert both arrays to Sets to remove duplicates\n    let set1 = new Set(arr1);\n    let set2 = new Set(arr2);\n    \n    // Step 1: Find intersection\n    let intersection = [...set1].filter(item => set2.has(item));\n    \n    // Step 2: Find union\n    let union = [...new Set([...set1, ...set2])];\n    \n    // Step 3: Sort both arrays numerically\n    intersection.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    union.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    \n    // Step 4: Return both sorted arrays\n    return [intersection, union];\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst arr1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4];\nconst arr2 = [2, 3, 5];\nconst [intersection, union] = findIntersectionAndUnion(arr1, arr2);\nconsole.log(\"Intersection:\", intersection); // [2, 3]\nconsole.log(\"Union:\", union); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Intersection**: By converting `arr1` and `arr2` to Sets (`set1` and `set2`), we remove duplicates. We then filter `set1` to include only elements that exist in `set2`, ensuring we have unique common elements.\n2. **Union**: We create a new Set from the combined spread of `set1` and `set2`, which inherently removes any duplicates and combines all unique elements.\n3. **Sorting**: We convert the Sets back to arrays and sort them using the numerical sort function `(a, b) => a - b` to ensure ascending order.\n4. **Return**: The function returns an array containing the sorted intersection and union arrays.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency and correctness, handling duplicates and edge cases effectively."
