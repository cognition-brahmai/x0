        "content": "Let's tackle this age puzzle step by step. So, we have a family of six people: four children and two parents. The father is older than the mother, and the mother is older than all the children. That makes sense. Now, the youngest child is half the age of the second oldest child. Hmm, and the sum of the ages of the three youngest children equals the age of the oldest child. I need to find out how old the youngest child is.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out the family members in order of their ages, from oldest to youngest. So, starting with the parents: father (oldest), mother (next oldest), and then the four children, who are all younger than the mother.\n\nLet me denote their ages with variables to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Father: F\n\n- Mother: M\n\n- Children: C1 (oldest child), C2, C3, C4 (youngest child)\n\nNow, from the information given:\n\n1. Father is older than the mother: F > M\n\n2. Mother is older than all the children: M > C1 > C2 > C3 > C4\n\n3. Youngest child is half the age of the second oldest child: C4 = 0.5 * C2\n\n4. Sum of the ages of the three youngest children equals the age of the oldest child: C4 + C3 + C2 = C1\n\nAlright, so I have these equations:\n\n- C4 = 0.5 * C2\n\n- C4 + C3 + C2 = C1\n\nI need to find C4, the age of the youngest child.\n\nHmm, I have two equations but four variables (C1, C2, C3, C4). That seems insufficient. Maybe I can express all variables in terms of C4.\n\nFrom equation 1: C4 = 0.5 * C2 \u2192 C2 = 2 * C4\n\nNow, plug C2 into equation 2:\n\nC4 + C3 + (2 * C4) = C1 \u2192 C1 = 3 * C4 + C3\n\nHmm, still have C3 and C4. Need another equation to relate C3 and C4.\n\nWait, I know that the children are ordered by age: C1 > C2 > C3 > C4\n\nAnd I have C2 = 2 * C4\n\nSo, C1 > C2 > C3 > C4, and C2 = 2 * C4\n\nTherefore, C1 > 2 * C4 > C3 > C4\n\nI need to find a relationship between C3 and C4.\n\nMaybe I can assume that the age differences between the children are constant, like they are spaced evenly in age. That might simplify things.\n\nLet's assume that each child is a certain number of years apart, say 'd' years apart.\n\nSo, C1 = C4 + 3d\n\nC2 = C4 + 2d\n\nC3 = C4 + d\n\nC4 = C4\n\nBut wait, I already have C2 = 2 * C4 from earlier.\n\nSo, C4 + 2d = 2 * C4 \u2192 2d = C4 \u2192 d = C4 / 2\n\nNow, I can express C1, C2, and C3 in terms of C4:\n\nC2 = 2 * C4 (from earlier)\n\nC3 = C4 + d = C4 + (C4 / 2) = 1.5 * C4\n\nC1 = C4 + 3d = C4 + 3*(C4 / 2) = C4 + 1.5 * C4 = 2.5 * C4\n\nNow, from equation 2: C4 + C3 + C2 = C1\n\nPlugging in the expressions:\n\nC4 + (1.5 * C4) + (2 * C4) = 2.5 * C4\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nC4 + 1.5 * C4 + 2 * C4 = 4.5 * C4\n\nSo, 4.5 * C4 = 2.5 * C4\n\nWait, that can't be right. 4.5 * C4 equals 2.5 * C4 only if C4 = 0, which doesn't make sense because ages can't be zero.\n\nHmm, maybe my assumption about the age differences being constant isn't correct. Maybe the ages aren't evenly spaced.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nI have:\n\nC4 = 0.5 * C2 \u2192 C2 = 2 * C4\n\nAnd C4 + C3 + C2 = C1 \u2192 C1 = C4 + C3 + 2 * C4 = 3 * C4 + C3\n\nNow, since the children are ordered by age, C1 > C2 > C3 > C4, and C2 = 2 * C4, then C3 must be between C4 and C2.\n\nBut I don't have any other direct relationships between C3 and C4.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the parents' ages.\n\nWait, the parents are older than the children, but their ages aren't directly related to the children's ages in any specified way, except that the father is older than the mother.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the sum of the ages of the three youngest children equals the age of the oldest child.\n\nSo, C2 + C3 + C4 = C1\n\nBut I already have that.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that C2 = 2 * C4 to express C1 in terms of C4.\n\nSo, C1 = 3 * C4 + C3\n\nBut I still have C3 in there.\n\nMaybe I need to find another equation involving C3 and C4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume specific ages and see if they fit the conditions.\n\nLet me try assigning a hypothetical age to C4 and see what follows.\n\nSuppose C4 is 4 years old.\n\nThen, C2 = 2 * C4 = 8 years old.\n\nNow, let's say C3 is 6 years old.\n\nThen, C1 = C4 + C3 + C2 = 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 years old.\n\nSo, the children's ages would be 18, 8, 6, and 4.\n\nNow, check if this satisfies all conditions.\n\nThe youngest is half the second oldest: 4 is half of 8? Yes.\n\nSum of the three youngest: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18, which equals the oldest child's age. Yes.\n\nBut are there any other conditions I need to consider? Oh, the parents' ages.\n\nThe father is older than the mother, who is older than all the children.\n\nSo, Father > Mother > Children.\n\nBut their exact ages aren't specified, only their relative ages.\n\nSo, as long as the mother is older than the oldest child (18), and the father is older than the mother, it's fine.\n\nFor example, Mother could be 30, Father 35.\n\nThat seems acceptable.\n\nSo, in this case, the youngest child is 4 years old.\n\nBut maybe there are other possible ages that satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet me try another set.\n\nSuppose C4 is 5 years old.\n\nThen, C2 = 10 years old.\n\nLet\u2019s say C3 is 7 years old.\n\nThen, C1 = 5 + 7 + 10 = 22 years old.\n\nSo, children are 22, 10, 7, and 5.\n\nAgain, youngest is half of second oldest: 5 is half of 10. Yes.\n\nSum of three youngest: 5 + 7 + 10 = 22, equals oldest child. Yes.\n\nParents could be, say, Mother 35, Father 40. That works.\n\nSo, in this case, the youngest is 5.\n\nWait a minute, in the first scenario, C4 was 4, and in the second, C4 was 5, and both seemed to satisfy the conditions.\n\nThat suggests that there might be multiple possible ages for the youngest child, which contradicts the idea that there's a single solution.\n\nBut puzzles like this usually have one definitive answer.\n\nMaybe I'm missing a constraint that relates the ages more strictly.\n\nLet me look back at the information given.\n\n\" The youngest child is half the age of the second oldest child.\"\n\n\" The sum of the ages of the three youngest children is equal to the age of the oldest child.\"\n\nI have used these two pieces of information, but perhaps there's more.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the ages of the three youngest children\" equals the age of the oldest child.\n\nSo, the three youngest are C2, C3, and C4, and their sum equals C1.\n\nBut actually, in terms of age, the three youngest would be C3, C4, and C2, assuming C1 is the oldest child.\n\nWait, in my earlier notation, C1 is the oldest child, then C2, C3, C4.\n\nSo, the three youngest children are C2, C3, C4.\n\nBut in terms of age, C2 > C3 > C4.\n\nSo, their sum is C2 + C3 + C4 = C1.\n\nAnd C4 = 0.5 * C2 \u2192 C2 = 2 * C4.\n\nNow, expressing C3 in terms of C4.\n\nFrom C1 = C2 + C3 + C4 = 2 * C4 + C3 + C4 = 3 * C4 + C3.\n\nBut I have C1 = 3 * C4 + C3.\n\nI need another equation to relate C3 and C4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the age differences between the children.\n\nBut earlier, assuming constant age differences led to a contradiction.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the age differences aren't constant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between the mother's age and the children's ages, but the problem doesn't specify any such relationship.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the mother's age being the sum of the ages of two children or something like that, but that's speculative.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I express everything in terms of C4.\n\nWe have:\n\nC2 = 2 * C4\n\nC1 = C2 + C3 + C4 = 2 * C4 + C3 + C4 = 3 * C4 + C3\n\nBut I need another equation to find C3 in terms of C4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the average age of the children or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the sum of all children's ages.\n\nSum of children's ages: C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = (3 * C4 + C3) + 2 * C4 + C3 + C4\n\nWait, that seems messy.\n\nLet me simplify:\n\nC1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = (3 * C4 + C3) + 2 * C4 + C3 + C4 = 3 * C4 + C3 + 2 * C4 + C3 + C4 = 6 * C4 + 2 * C3\n\nBut I don't have any information about the sum of the children's ages.\n\nMaybe I need to think of the parents' ages in relation to the children's ages.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide any such relationship.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the mother is older than all the children, so M > C1, and F > M.\n\nBut without specific ages or relationships, that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a hidden relationship or a mathematical constraint that I'm missing.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a way to express C3 in terms of C4.\n\nFrom C1 = 3 * C4 + C3, and knowing that C1 > C2 > C3 > C4, and C2 = 2 * C4, then:\n\n3 * C4 + C3 = C1 > C2 = 2 * C4\n\nSo, 3 * C4 + C3 > 2 * C4 \u2192 C3 > -C4\n\nBut since ages are positive, C3 > 0.\n\nAlso, C3 > C4, because C3 is older than C4.\n\nWait, no, C3 > C4? Wait, C3 is between C4 and C2.\n\nGiven that C2 = 2 * C4, and C3 is between C4 and C2, then C4 < C3 < 2 * C4.\n\nWait, no, C3 should be greater than C4, since C3 is older than C4.\n\nSo, C3 > C4.\n\nAlso, C3 < C2 = 2 * C4.\n\nSo, C4 < C3 < 2 * C4.\n\nTherefore, C3 could be any value between C4 and 2 * C4.\n\nBut I need a specific value for C4.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to set up an equation where the only variable is C4.\n\nLet me see.\n\nI have C1 = 3 * C4 + C3\n\nBut I also have that C1 is the oldest child, and M > C1.\n\nBut without knowing M, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a ratio or another relationship I can assume.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that the sum of the ages of the three youngest children equals the age of the oldest child, and the youngest is half the age of the second oldest.\n\nLet me try to express C3 in terms of C4 using the inequality C4 < C3 < 2 * C4.\n\nSuppose C3 = k * C4, where 1 < k < 2.\n\nThen, C1 = 3 * C4 + k * C4 = (3 + k) * C4\n\nNow, I need to find k such that the conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut without additional constraints, k can be any value between 1 and 2, leading to different values of C4.\n\nThis suggests that there are infinitely many solutions, which contradicts the idea of a puzzle with a single answer.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the ages are integers, which might limit the possible values.\n\nLet me assume that ages are integers in years.\n\nThen, C4 must be an integer, and C2 = 2 * C4 is also an integer.\n\nC3 must be an integer greater than C4 and less than C2.\n\nSo, for C4 = 4, C2 = 8, C3 could be 5, 6, or 7.\n\nSimilarly, for C4 = 5, C2 = 10, C3 could be 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n\nBut in both cases, C1 = C2 + C3 + C4, which seems to work.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario, C4 = 4, C2 = 8, C3 = 6, C1 = 18.\n\nIn the second, C4 = 5, C2 = 10, C3 = 7, C1 = 22.\n\nBoth seem valid.\n\nSo, maybe the puzzle allows for multiple solutions, but perhaps there's a standard approach to find the youngest possible age for the youngest child.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mathematical relationship I'm missing that ties these variables together.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a way to express C3 in terms of C4 using the sum.\n\nGiven that C1 = C2 + C3 + C4 = 2 * C4 + C3 + C4 = 3 * C4 + C3\n\nBut I don't have another equation to relate C3 and C4.\n\nWait a second, maybe I need to consider the mother's age.\n\nThe mother is older than all the children, so M > C1.\n\nBut without knowing anything else about M, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a generational age gap, but that's speculative.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the sum of the children's ages relates to the parents' ages in some way, but again, that's assuming too much.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose I let C4 be x years old.\n\nThen, C2 = 2x\n\nC1 = 3x + C3\n\nNow, C3 must be greater than x and less than 2x, and probably an integer if ages are in whole years.\n\nSo, C3 could be x + 1, x + 2, ..., up to 2x - 1.\n\nThen, C1 = 3x + C3\n\nNow, the sum of the three youngest children is C2 + C3 + C4 = 2x + C3 + x = 3x + C3, which equals C1, as per the given condition.\n\nSo, this holds true.\n\nBut I need to find a specific value for x (C4).\n\nPerhaps there's a constraint on the sum of all children's ages or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the parents' ages and the children's ages that isn't stated, but I shouldn't assume that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the average age of the children.\n\nThe sum of the children's ages is C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = (3x + C3) + 2x + C3 + x = 6x + 2C3\n\nBut without knowing the average or any other information, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the differences in ages.\n\nBut earlier attempts at assuming constant differences led to inconsistencies.\n\nPerhaps I need to accept that there are multiple solutions and that additional information is needed to find a unique answer.\n\nHowever, since this is presented as a puzzle, there's likely a single intended answer.\n\nMaybe I need to look for a mathematical relationship that enforces a unique solution.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a way to set up an equation that allows me to solve for x.\n\nGiven that C3 is between x and 2x, let's assume that C3 is equal to some multiple of x.\n\nSuppose C3 = kx, where k is a real number between 1 and 2.\n\nThen, C1 = 3x + kx = x(3 + k)\n\nBut without knowing k, I can't find x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the difference between C3 and C4 is equal to the difference between C2 and C3.\n\nIn other words, if the age differences between consecutive children are equal.\n\nSo, C2 - C3 = C3 - C4\n\nThen, C3 = (C2 + C4)/2\n\nGiven that C2 = 2x and C4 = x, then C3 = (2x + x)/2 = 1.5x\n\nSo, C3 = 1.5x\n\nNow, C1 = 3x + C3 = 3x + 1.5x = 4.5x\n\nBut earlier, when I assumed constant age differences, it led to a contradiction.\n\nWait, in that case, C1 = 4.5x, C2 = 2x, C3 = 1.5x, C4 = x\n\nThen, sum of three youngest: C2 + C3 + C4 = 2x + 1.5x + x = 4.5x = C1, which holds.\n\nBut earlier, when I plugged these into the equations, I got 4.5x = 2.5x, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me recast this.\n\nIf C3 = (C2 + C4)/2 = (2x + x)/2 = 1.5x\n\nThen, C1 = C2 + C3 + C4 = 2x + 1.5x + x = 4.5x\n\nBut earlier, I thought C1 = 2.5x, which was incorrect.\n\nI must have made a mistake there.\n\nSo, correcting that, C1 = 4.5x\n\nNow, is there any other relationship that can help me find x?\n\nPerhaps considering the parents' ages.\n\nThe mother is older than the children, so M > C1 = 4.5x\n\nAnd the father is older than the mother, F > M\n\nBut without specific ages for the parents, I can't use this to find x.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the mother's age is related to the children's ages in a specific way, but that seems like speculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the puzzle implies that all ages are integers, so x must be a multiple that makes all ages integers.\n\nGiven that C3 = 1.5x, for C3 to be an integer, x must be even.\n\nLet\u2019s set x = 2n, where n is an integer.\n\nThen, C4 = 2n\n\nC2 = 4n\n\nC3 = 1.5 * 2n = 3n\n\nC1 = 4.5 * 2n = 9n\n\nSo, the children's ages are 9n, 4n, 3n, and 2n.\n\nNow, for n = 1:\n\nC1 = 9, C2 = 4, C3 = 3, C4 = 2\n\nCheck if C4 is half of C2: 2 is half of 4. Yes.\n\nSum of three youngest: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9, which equals C1. Yes.\n\nSo, n = 1 is possible, making C4 = 2 years old.\n\nFor n = 2:\n\nC1 = 18, C2 = 8, C3 = 6, C4 = 4\n\nAgain, 4 is half of 8. Sum: 8 + 6 + 4 = 18. Yes.\n\nn = 3:\n\nC1 = 27, C2 = 12, C3 = 9, C4 = 6\n\n6 is half of 12. Sum: 12 + 9 + 6 = 27. Yes.\n\nSo, there are multiple possible values for n, each giving a different age for the youngest child: 2, 4, 6, etc.\n\nBut puzzles like this often expect a specific answer, so maybe I need to find the youngest possible age for the youngest child.\n\nIn that case, the smallest positive integer value for C4 is 2 years old (when n=1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a constraint I haven't considered that would fix n at a particular value.\n\nFor example, maybe the mother's age is related to the children's ages in a specific way.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide that information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the puzzle assumes that the children's ages are all different by at least one year, which is already satisfied in the above scenarios.\n\nGiven that, the youngest possible age for the youngest child is 2 years old.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the youngest child is 2 years old.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
