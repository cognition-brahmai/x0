        "content": "Let's see here. So, there's a bus that goes from station A to station B in 3 hours, and the total distance is 180 miles. It's traveling at a constant speed, which makes things easier because the speed doesn't change. I need to find out how many minutes it takes to travel half that distance.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the bus's speed is. Since speed is distance divided by time, I can calculate that. The distance is 180 miles and the time is 3 hours. So, speed equals 180 miles divided by 3 hours, which is 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, half the distance would be half of 180 miles, which is 90 miles. So, I need to find out how long it takes to travel 90 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\nTime is equal to distance divided by speed, so time equals 90 miles divided by 60 miles per hour. That gives me 1.5 hours.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes, not hours. So, I need to convert 1.5 hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1.5 hours times 60 minutes per hour equals 90 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take the bus 90 minutes to travel half the distance.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using proportions or something like that.\n\nIf the whole trip takes 3 hours for 180 miles, then half the distance should take half the time, right? Because the speed is constant.\n\nSo, half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours, which again is 90 minutes. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check the speed again. 180 miles in 3 hours is indeed 60 mph. And 90 miles at 60 mph is 1.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nGiven that, time for half the distance is 90 miles / 60 mph = 1.5 hours = 90 minutes.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to overcomplicate it.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
