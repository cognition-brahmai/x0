        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which is 300 miles apart. It takes 6 hours to do that. So, to find the speed, I know that speed is equal to distance divided by time. So, speed equals 300 miles divided by 6 hours, which is 50 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the question is, if the train took only 4 hours to make the same journey, what would its speed be? So, again, using the formula speed equals distance divided by time, it would be 300 miles divided by 4 hours. That would be 75 miles per hour.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If the train is covering the same distance in less time, it must be going faster, which makes sense because 75 miles per hour is faster than 50 miles per hour.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of proportions. If the time decreases, the speed must increase to cover the same distance. So, from 6 hours to 4 hours, that's a decrease in time by one-third, since 4 is two-thirds of 6. But I think that's not the right way to look at it.\n\nActually, time is inversely proportional to speed when distance is constant. So, if time decreases by a factor, speed increases by the reciprocal of that factor.\n\nLet me calculate the factor. Original time is 6 hours, new time is 4 hours. So, the factor is 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3. So, the new speed should be the original speed divided by 2/3, which is the same as multiplied by 3/2.\n\nOriginal speed is 50 mph, multiplied by 3/2 is 75 mph. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the speed required to cover 300 miles in 4 hours. So, speed equals distance over time, which is 300 miles over 4 hours, which is 75 mph.\n\nI can also verify this by considering the relationship between speed, time, and distance. If distance equals speed multiplied by time, then speed equals distance divided by time.\n\nSo, in this case, distance is fixed at 300 miles. If time is 4 hours, then speed must be 300 divided by 4, which is 75 mph.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the original scenario, where speed is 50 mph and time is 6 hours, then distance is 50 times 6, which is 300 miles. So, that checks out.\n\nNow, if the train takes less time, say 4 hours, to cover the same distance, its speed must increase accordingly.\n\nAnother angle to approach this is to consider the rate of travel. The train's speed is essentially the rate at which it covers distance per unit of time.\n\nSo, if it covers 300 miles in 6 hours, its rate is 50 miles per hour.\n\nIf it needs to cover the same 300 miles in 4 hours, its rate must be higher to cover the distance in less time.\n\nSo, 300 miles divided by 4 hours is indeed 75 miles per hour.\n\nI can also think about it in terms of how much distance is covered per hour.\n\nIn 6 hours at 50 mph, it covers 300 miles.\n\nIn 4 hours at 75 mph, it also covers 300 miles.\n\nSo, both scenarios cover the same distance, but at different speeds and times.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the ratio of times, 4 hours to 6 hours is 2:3.\n\nSince time and speed are inversely proportional when distance is constant, the ratio of speeds should be 3:2.\n\nOriginal speed is 50 mph, so new speed should be 50 multiplied by 3/2, which is 75 mph.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the increase in speed required to reduce the time from 6 hours to 4 hours.\n\nThe difference in time is 2 hours. So, to save 2 hours over 6 hours, the speed must increase by a certain amount.\n\nBut I think sticking to the basic formula of speed equals distance over time is the most straightforward approach.\n\nSo, speed required to travel 300 miles in 4 hours is 75 miles per hour.\n\nTo double-check, if the train travels at 75 mph for 4 hours, the distance covered would be 75 times 4, which is 300 miles. That matches the required distance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 75 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
