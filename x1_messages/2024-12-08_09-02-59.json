        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train's journey. It says the train travels at an average speed of 60 mph for the first half of its journey and then increases its speed to 80 mph for the second half. The total distance is 420 miles, and I need to find out how long the entire trip takes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find the total time of the journey. I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. But here, the train is traveling at different speeds for each half of the journey.\n\nSo, the total distance is 420 miles. The first half is 210 miles at 60 mph, and the second half is also 210 miles at 80 mph.\n\nLet me calculate the time for each half separately and then add them together to get the total time.\n\nStarting with the first half:\n\nDistance: 210 miles\n\nSpeed: 60 mph\n\nTime = distance / speed = 210 / 60 = 3.5 hours\n\nNow, the second half:\n\nDistance: 210 miles\n\nSpeed: 80 mph\n\nTime = distance / speed = 210 / 80 = 2.625 hours\n\nNow, I need to add these two times together to get the total time.\n\nTotal time = time for first half + time for second half = 3.5 + 2.625 = 6.125 hours\n\nBut I should check if this makes sense. Let's see, 60 mph for 210 miles takes 3.5 hours, and 80 mph for 210 miles takes 2.625 hours. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the average speed for the entire journey and see if that matches.\n\nAverage speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nBut in this case, since the speeds are different for each half and the distances are equal, the average speed is not just the arithmetic mean of the two speeds.\n\nActually, for equal distances, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nThe formula for average speed when distances are equal is:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * speed1 * speed2) / (speed1 + speed2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * 60 * 80) / (60 + 80) = (9600) / (140) = 68.571 mph (approximately)\n\nNow, total time = total distance / average speed = 420 / 68.571 \u2248 6.125 hours\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the times to minutes to make it more understandable.\n\n3.5 hours is 3 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n2.625 hours is 2 hours and 37.5 minutes.\n\nAdding them together: 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours; 30 minutes + 37.5 minutes = 67.5 minutes, which is 1 hour and 7.5 minutes.\n\nSo, total time is 5 hours + 1 hour and 7.5 minutes = 6 hours and 7.5 minutes.\n\nBut in decimal form, it's 6.125 hours.\n\nAlternatively, 0.125 hours is 7.5 minutes, so yes, it matches.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.125 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
