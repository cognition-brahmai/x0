        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Python. The graph is represented by an adjacency matrix, and I need to find the shortest distances from a source node to all other nodes. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Dijkstra's algorithm is. It's a way to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which works for graphs with non-negative edge path costs. It's pretty widely used, so that's good.\n\nAn adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. In this case, since it's a matrix, I'll have to deal with a 2D list in Python.\n\nSo, the input will be an adjacency matrix, and a source node. The output should be the shortest distances from the source to all other nodes.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved in Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialize distances**: Set the distance to the source as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\n\n2. **Create a set of unvisited nodes**: Initially, all nodes are unvisited.\n\n3. **Select the node with the smallest distance**: This will be the current node.\n\n4. **Update distances to neighbors**: For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the distance through the current node. If this distance is less than the previously known distance, update the distance.\n\n5. **Mark the current node as visited**: Once all neighbors are checked, mark the node as visited.\n\n6. **Repeat steps 3-5** until all nodes are visited or the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes is infinity.\n\nI need to be careful with how I handle the adjacency matrix. Since it's a matrix, accessing elements should be straightforward using indices.\n\nLet me consider an example to make sure I understand.\n\nSuppose I have the following adjacency matrix:\n\n```\n\n0 -1 4\n\n-1 0 3\n\n4 3 0\n\n```\n\nHere, -1 indicates no direct edge. So, node 0 is connected to node 2 with weight 4, node 1 is connected to node 2 with weight 3, and so on.\n\nIf the source is node 0, the shortest distances should be:\n\n- Node 0: 0\n\n- Node 1: 7 (through node 2)\n\n- Node 2: 4\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nFrom node 0 to node 2: direct edge with weight 4.\n\nFrom node 2 to node 1: edge with weight 3.\n\nSo, total weight from 0 to 1 via 2 is 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nIs there a shorter path? No, since there's no direct edge from 0 to 1.\n\nAlright, so distances should be [0, 7, 4].\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI'll need to:\n\n- Represent the graph as a 2D list.\n\n- Keep track of distances using another list, initialized with infinity except for the source which is 0.\n\n- Keep track of visited nodes, perhaps with a set or a list of booleans.\n\n- repeatedly select the node with the smallest distance that hasn't been visited yet.\n\n- update the distances of its neighbors.\n\nI need to handle the selection of the node with the smallest distance efficiently. Since this is Dijkstra's algorithm, and we're using an adjacency matrix, a simple approach would work, but for larger graphs, I might need to optimize.\n\nIn Python, I can use `float('inf')` to represent infinity.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where there are no edges between certain nodes, which is represented by -1 in the matrix.\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the neighbors of a node in an adjacency matrix.\n\nGiven a node `u`, its neighbors are all nodes `v` where `matrix[u][v] != -1`.\n\nSo, in code, for each `v` in range(len(matrix[u])), if matrix[u][v] != -1, then `v` is a neighbor.\n\nNow, for updating the distances:\n\nIf distance[u] + matrix[u][v] < distance[v], then update distance[v] = distance[u] + matrix[u][v].\n\nI need to make sure that I don't update the distance of a node that has already been visited.\n\nSo, I'll need a way to mark nodes as visited.\n\nPerhaps a list of booleans, `visited = [False] * num_nodes`.\n\nAfter all nodes are visited, or when the smallest distance in unvisited nodes is infinity, I can stop.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Initialize distances: `dist = [float('inf')] * num_nodes`\n\n- Set `dist[source] = 0`\n\n- Initialize `visited = [False] * num_nodes`\n\n- For _ in range(num_nodes):\n\n- Select node `u` with the smallest distance in `dist` where `not visited[u]`\n\n- Mark `visited[u] = True`\n\n- For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n\n- If `not visited[v]`:\n\n- If `dist[u] + matrix[u][v] < dist[v]`:\n\n- `dist[v] = dist[u] + matrix[u][v]`\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nBut selecting the node with the smallest distance each time can be optimized.\n\nIn a simple implementation, I can iterate through all unvisited nodes to find the one with the smallest distance.\n\nBut for larger graphs, this would be inefficient.\n\nIn Python, I can use the `min` function with a key to find the node with the smallest distance among unvisited nodes.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a priority queue, but since the problem allows using an adjacency matrix, which typically implies a dense graph, the simple approach should be acceptable.\n\nLet me consider implementing it simply first, and then think about optimizations if needed.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the source node is out of bounds.\n\nI should add checks to ensure that the source is a valid node.\n\nLet me think about the function signature.\n\nIt should take the adjacency matrix and the source node as inputs.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n`def dijkstra(matrix, source):`\n\nI need to handle cases where the matrix is empty or invalid.\n\nBut for simplicity, assume the matrix is valid and source is a valid node.\n\nI should also consider that the graph may not be connected, so some nodes may not be reachable from the source.\n\nIn such cases, their distances should remain infinity, which is fine.\n\nLet me try writing some pseudocode:\n\ndef dijkstra(matrix, source):\n\nnum_nodes = len(matrix)\n\ndist = [float('inf')] * num_nodes\n\ndist[source] = 0\n\nvisited = [False] * num_nodes\n\nfor _ in range(num_nodes):\n\n# Select node with smallest distance\n\nu = select_min_distance(dist, visited)\n\nvisited[u] = True\n\n# Update distances to neighbors\n\nfor v in range(num_nodes):\n\nif matrix[u][v] != -1 and not visited[v]:\n\nif dist[u] + matrix[u][v] < dist[v]:\n\ndist[v] = dist[u] + matrix[u][v]\n\nreturn dist\n\ndef select_min_distance(dist, visited):\n\nmin_dist = float('inf')\n\nmin_index = -1\n\nfor i in range(len(dist)):\n\nif not visited[i] and dist[i] < min_dist:\n\nmin_dist = dist[i]\n\nmin_index = i\n\nreturn min_index\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n\nLet me test this pseudocode with the earlier example.\n\nMatrix:\n\n0 -1 4\n\n-1 0 3\n\n4 3 0\n\nSource: 0\n\nInitialize:\n\ndist = [0, inf, inf]\n\nvisited = [False, False, False]\n\nIteration 1:\n\nSelect u = 0 (smallest distance, 0)\n\nMark visited[0] = True\n\nUpdate neighbors:\n\nv=0: matrix[0][0]=0, but visited[0]=True, skip\n\nv=1: matrix[0][1]=-1, no edge\n\nv=2: matrix[0][2]=4, not visited, 0 + 4 < inf, so dist[2] = 4\n\nNow dist = [0, inf, 4]\n\nIteration 2:\n\nSelect u=2 (smallest distance, 4)\n\nMark visited[2]=True\n\nUpdate neighbors:\n\nv=0: matrix[2][0]=4, visited[0]=True, skip\n\nv=1: matrix[2][1]=3, not visited, 4 + 3 < inf, so dist[1] = 7\n\nv=2: matrix[2][2]=0, skip\n\nNow dist = [0, 7, 4]\n\nIteration 3:\n\nSelect u=1 (smallest distance, 7)\n\nMark visited[1]=True\n\nNo unvisited neighbors to update\n\nFinal dist = [0, 7, 4]\n\nWhich matches what I expected earlier.\n\nGood.\n\nLet me consider another example to test for correctness.\n\nSuppose a graph with one node:\n\nMatrix: [0]\n\nSource: 0\n\nShould return [0]\n\nAnother example:\n\nMatrix:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 3\n\n0 3 0\n\nSource: 0\n\nPaths:\n\n0 to 1: direct edge with weight 2\n\n0 to 2: 0 -> 1 -> 2 with weight 2 + 3 = 5\n\nDirect 0 to 2: no edge\n\nSo, dist should be [0, 2, 5]\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nInitialize:\n\ndist = [0, inf, inf]\n\nvisited = [False, False, False]\n\nIteration 1:\n\nSelect u=0 (dist=0)\n\nMark visited[0]=True\n\nUpdate neighbors:\n\nv=0: skip\n\nv=1: matrix[0][1]=2, not visited, 0 + 2 < inf, dist[1]=2\n\nv=2: matrix[0][2]=0, no edge\n\nNow dist = [0, 2, inf]\n\nIteration 2:\n\nSelect u=1 (dist=2)\n\nMark visited[1]=True\n\nUpdate neighbors:\n\nv=0: matrix[1][0]=2, visited[0]=True, skip\n\nv=1: skip\n\nv=2: matrix[1][2]=3, not visited, 2 + 3 < inf, dist[2]=5\n\nNow dist = [0, 2, 5]\n\nIteration 3:\n\nSelect u=2 (dist=5)\n\nMark visited[2]=True\n\nNo unvisited neighbors\n\nFinal dist = [0, 2, 5]\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: disconnected graph\n\nMatrix:\n\n0 1 0 0\n\n1 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 1\n\n0 0 1 0\n\nSource: 0\n\nPaths:\n\n0 connected to 1, distance 1\n\n2 and 3 are not connected to 0\n\nSo, dist should be [0, 1, inf, inf]\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nInitialize:\n\ndist = [0, inf, inf, inf]\n\nvisited = [False, False, False, False]\n\nIteration 1:\n\nSelect u=0 (dist=0)\n\nMark visited[0]=True\n\nUpdate neighbors:\n\nv=0: skip\n\nv=1: matrix[0][1]=1, not visited, 0 + 1 < inf, dist[1]=1\n\nv=2: matrix[0][2]=0, no edge\n\nv=3: matrix[0][3]=0, no edge\n\nNow dist = [0, 1, inf, inf]\n\nIteration 2:\n\nSelect u=1 (dist=1)\n\nMark visited[1]=True\n\nUpdate neighbors:\n\nv=0: matrix[1][0]=1, visited[0]=True, skip\n\nv=1: skip\n\nv=2: matrix[1][2]=0, no edge\n\nv=3: matrix[1][3]=0, no edge\n\nNow dist = [0, 1, inf, inf]\n\nIteration 3:\n\nSelect u=2 (dist=inf)\n\nBut since u=2 and u=3 are not connected to the source, their distances remain inf.\n\nFinal dist = [0, 1, inf, inf]\n\nCorrect.\n\nSeems like the algorithm works as expected in these cases.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Python.\n\nI should also consider the time complexity.\n\nIn this implementation, selecting the minimum distance node takes O(V) time, and updating the neighbors takes O(E) time per iteration.\n\nSo overall time complexity is O(V^2), which is acceptable for dense graphs.\n\nSince the problem specifies an adjacency matrix, which is O(V^2) space, this should be fine.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like:\n\n- Single node graph\n\n- Source node has no outgoing edges\n\n- Negative weights (but Dijkstra's doesn't handle negative weights, so assume all weights are non-negative, except -1 for no edge)\n\nWait, in the matrix, -1 represents no edge, and positive numbers represent edge weights.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that -1 is treated as no edge, and all other values are positive weights.\n\nI should add comments to the code for clarity.\n\nAlso, I can return the distance list, as per the requirement.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code.\n\nI can have the main function `dijkstra(matrix, source)`, and perhaps a helper function to select the node with the smallest distance.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the `min` function with a key in Python to find the node with the smallest distance.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSomething like:\n\nu = min([v for v in range(num_nodes) if not visited[v]], key=lambda v: dist[v])\n\nThis would work and is more concise.\n\nI need to make sure that the list is not empty when selecting the min.\n\nBut since we're iterating num_nodes times, and marking one node per iteration, it should be fine.\n\nLet me adjust the pseudocode:\n\ndef dijkstra(matrix, source):\n\nnum_nodes = len(matrix)\n\ndist = [float('inf')] * num_nodes\n\ndist[source] = 0\n\nvisited = [False] * num_nodes\n\nfor _ in range(num_nodes):\n\n# Select node with smallest distance\n\nu = min([v for v in range(num_nodes) if not visited[v]], key=lambda v: dist[v])\n\nvisited[u] = True\n\n# Update distances to neighbors\n\nfor v in range(num_nodes):\n\nif matrix[u][v] != -1 and not visited[v]:\n\nif dist[u] + matrix[u][v] < dist[v]:\n\ndist[v] = dist[u] + matrix[u][v]\n\nreturn dist\n\nThis is cleaner.\n\nI can use this approach.\n\nLet me think about the time complexity again.\n\nThe min operation inside the loop is O(V), and it's done V times, so O(V^2).\n\nThe inner loop runs E times, but in an adjacency matrix, E can be up to V^2, so overall it's still O(V^2).\n\nFor sparse graphs, this isn't the most efficient, but since we're using an adjacency matrix, it's assumed that the graph is dense.\n\nI should also consider that the matrix could be very large, but in practice, Python handles large lists reasonably well.\n\nNow, to make it more efficient, I could use a priority queue, but that would complicate the implementation, especially since we need to update distances and maintain the queue.\n\nFor simplicity, and given the constraints, I'll stick with the straightforward approach.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the graph.\n\nIn Python, a list of lists can represent the adjacency matrix.\n\nFor example:\n\nmatrix = [\n\n[0, 2, 0],\n\n[2, 0, 3],\n\n[0, 3, 0]\n\n]\n\nSource = 0\n\nShould return [0, 2, 5]\n\nAs per the earlier example.\n\nI should also consider that the matrix might not be symmetric, i.e., it could be a directed graph.\n\nSo, edges are one-way unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, in the adjacency matrix, if matrix[u][v] != matrix[v][u], it's a directed graph.\n\nI need to make sure that the implementation handles directed graphs correctly.\n\nFor example:\n\nMatrix:\n\n0 2 0\n\n0 0 3\n\n0 0 0\n\nSource: 0\n\nPaths:\n\n0 to 1: 2\n\n0 to 2: 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, dist = [0, 2, 5]\n\nAnother example:\n\nMatrix:\n\n0 2 0\n\n3 0 3\n\n0 0 0\n\nSource: 0\n\nPaths:\n\n0 to 1: 2\n\n0 to 2: directly 0 (no edge), or through 1: 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, dist = [0, 2, 5]\n\nCorrect.\n\nNow, implement the function accordingly.\n\nI need to make sure that the function works for both directed and undirected graphs, based on the input matrix.\n\nI think the current implementation should handle that, as it uses the matrix[u][v] values directly.\n\nNow, to implement this in code.\n\nI should also consider that the matrix could have diagonal elements, which represent self-loops.\n\nBut in most graph representations, self-loops are not considered, or they might have zero weight.\n\nIn this case, since the diagonal is 0 in the examples, I'll assume no self-loops or zero-weight self-loops.\n\nI need to make sure that the diagonal elements don't affect the distance calculations.\n\nIn the initialization, dist[source] = 0, which is fine.\n\nDuring the iteration, when updating neighbors, if matrix[u][u] is considered, but since it's zero, it won't change the distance.\n\nBut to be safe, I can skip the diagonal elements or ensure that they don't affect the distances.\n\nWait, in the update step, when u is the node being visited, and v is a neighbor, if u == v, matrix[u][v] is the diagonal, which is 0.\n\nBut adding 0 to dist[u] won't change dist[v], since dist[v] is already at least 0.\n\nSo, it's safe to include or exclude them.\n\nI think it's fine as is.\n\nNow, to implement the function.\n\nI should also think about the output format.\n\nThe problem says to output the shortest distances from the source to all other nodes.\n\nSo, returning the dist list should suffice.\n\nI can print it or return it as is.\n\nLet me think about how to present it.\n\nPerhaps return a list of distances, with indices corresponding to node indices.\n\nFor example, dist[0] is the distance from source to node 0, and so on.\n\nIn the earlier example, source=0, dist=[0,7,4].\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider that the nodes are labeled from 0 to num_nodes - 1, based on their indices in the matrix.\n\nNow, to implement this in code.\n\nI need to define the function `dijkstra(matrix, source)`.\n\nI should add comments to explain each step.\n\nAlso, I can add a check to ensure that the source is within the range of num_nodes.\n\nIf source >= num_nodes, raise an error or handle it appropriately.\n\nBut for now, assuming source is valid.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for a graph represented by an adjacency matrix in Python, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize Distances:** Set the distance to the source as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\n2. **Track Unvisited Nodes:** Use a list to keep track of which nodes have been visited.\n3. **Select Node with Smallest Distance:** Find the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the source.\n4. **Update Neighbors' Distances:** For each unvisited neighbor of the selected node, calculate the distance through the current node and update if it's smaller.\n5. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all nodes are visited.\n\n### Approach\n\n- **Data Structure:** Use a 2D list (adjacency matrix) to represent the graph.\n- **Distance Tracking:** Use a list to keep track of the shortest distances from the source to each node.\n- **Visited Nodes:** Use a list to track which nodes have been visited.\n- **Selection of Min Distance Node:** Find the node with the smallest distance that hasn't been visited yet.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef dijkstra(matrix, source):\n    import heapq\n\n    num_nodes = len(matrix)\n    dist = [float('inf')] * num_nodes\n    dist[source] = 0\n    visited = [False] * num_nodes\n\n    # Using a priority queue to efficiently get the min distance node\n    pq = [(0, source)]\n\n    while pq:\n        current_dist, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        if not visited[u]:\n            visited[u] = True\n            for v in range(num_nodes):\n                if matrix[u][v] != -1 and not visited[v]:\n                    new_dist = dist[u] + matrix[u][v]\n                    if new_dist < dist[v]:\n                        dist[v] = new_dist\n                        heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, v))\n    return dist\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Set the distance to the source as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\n   - Use a priority queue to efficiently select the node with the smallest distance.\n\n2. **Node Selection and Distance Update:**\n   - While the priority queue is not empty, pop the node with the smallest distance.\n   - For each unvisited neighbor, calculate the new distance through the current node.\n   - If the new distance is smaller than the known distance, update the distance and push the neighbor into the priority queue.\n\n3. **Completion:**\n   - The algorithm continues until all nodes are visited or the priority queue is empty.\n   - The `dist` list holds the shortest distances from the source to each node.\n\nThis implementation ensures efficient selection of the next node to visit using a priority queue, optimizing the performance for graphs with a large number of nodes."
