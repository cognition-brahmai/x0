        "content": "Let's see. So, there are four people who need to cross a bridge at night, and they've only got one flashlight. The bridge is dangerous to cross without a flashlight, and it can only hold two people at a time. Each person takes a different amount of time to cross: 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes. When two people cross together, they have to go at the slower person's pace.\n\nI need to figure out the fastest way for all four of them to get across.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out the times for each person:\n\n- Person A: 1 minute\n\n- Person B: 2 minutes\n\n- Person C: 5 minutes\n\n- Person D: 10 minutes\n\nThe goal is to get all of them across in the least amount of time possible.\n\nI know that the bridge can only hold two people at a time, and they need to share the flashlight. So, two people will cross together, and then one will have to bring the flashlight back, and so on.\n\nI need to minimize the total time. To do that, I should probably try to have the faster people make the return trips with the flashlight.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. First, send the two fastest people across together. So, Person A (1 minute) and Person B (2 minutes). They cross together, which means they have to go at the slower one's pace, so that's 2 minutes.\n\n2. Now, one of them has to bring the flashlight back. To minimize time, I should have the fastest one bring it back. So, Person A comes back, which takes 1 minute.\n\n3. Now, the flashlight is back on the original side. Next, I should send the two slower people across. So, Person C (5 minutes) and Person D (10 minutes). They cross together, at the slower one's pace, which is 10 minutes.\n\n4. Now, the flashlight is on the other side. To get it back, I should have Person B come back, since Person A is already on the other side. Person B takes 2 minutes to come back.\n\n5. Finally, Person A and Person B cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nLet's add up the times:\n\n- First cross: 2 minutes\n\n- Person A back: 1 minute\n\n- Second cross: 10 minutes\n\n- Person B back: 2 minutes\n\n- Final cross: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a faster way?\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nWhat if I have the fastest person accompany everyone across?\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Person A and Person B cross together: 2 minutes\n\n2. Person A comes back: 1 minute\n\n3. Person A and Person C cross: 5 minutes\n\n4. Person A comes back: 1 minute\n\n5. Person A and Person D cross: 10 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes\n\nThat's worse than the previous plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have the two slowest cross together first.\n\n1. Person C and Person D cross together: 10 minutes\n\n2. Person B comes back: 2 minutes\n\n3. Person A and Person B cross together: 2 minutes\n\n4. Person A comes back: 1 minute\n\n5. Person A and Person C cross: 5 minutes\n\n6. Person A comes back: 1 minute\n\n7. Person A and Person D cross: 10 minutes\n\nTotal time: 10 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 31 minutes\n\nThat's even worse.\n\nAnother idea: have the fastest people make multiple trips.\n\n1. Person A and Person B cross: 2 minutes\n\n2. Person A comes back: 1 minute\n\n3. Person A and Person C cross: 5 minutes\n\n4. Person A comes back: 1 minute\n\n5. Person A and Person D cross: 10 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes\n\nSame as before.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to have someone make a trip without crossing.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI've heard of this problem before, maybe there's a standard solution.\n\nOh, right. The standard way is to minimize the time by having the faster people make the return trips.\n\nSo, in the first plan I thought of, which took 17 minutes, that seems to be the optimal.\n\nBut let me see if there's a way to make it faster.\n\nWhat if, after the first crossing of A and B, instead of A coming back, B stays and A brings the flashlight back.\n\nWait, that's what I did in the first plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have someone else bring the flashlight back.\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me try a different sequence.\n\n1. Send A and C across: 5 minutes\n\n2. A comes back: 1 minute\n\n3. Send A and D across: 10 minutes\n\n4. A comes back: 1 minute\n\n5. Send A and B across: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 5 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 19 minutes\n\nStill 19 minutes.\n\nNot better than the first plan.\n\nHmm.\n\nIs there a way to have multiple people moving at the same time?\n\nNo, the bridge can only hold two at a time.\n\nAnd they need to share the flashlight.\n\nWait, maybe have someone on the other side bring the flashlight back.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Send A and B across: 2 minutes\n\n2. B stays there, and A brings the flashlight back: 1 minute\n\n3. Send C and D across: 10 minutes\n\n4. B brings the flashlight back: 2 minutes\n\n5. Send A and B across: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes\n\nSame as before.\n\nIs there a way to make the return trips faster?\n\nWell, A is the fastest, so having A make the return trips makes sense.\n\nWait, what if after the first crossing of A and B, instead of A coming back, B stays and A brings the flashlight back.\n\nThen, send C and D across: 10 minutes\n\nThen, A brings the flashlight back: 1 minute\n\nFinally, A and B cross again: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes\n\nSame as before.\n\nIs there a way to overlap some of these trips?\n\nWait, maybe have A and C cross first: 5 minutes\n\nThen, A comes back: 1 minute\n\nThen, A and B cross: 2 minutes\n\nThen, A comes back: 1 minute\n\nThen, A and D cross: 10 minutes\n\nTotal time: 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes\n\nStill 19 minutes.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe send A and D across first: 10 minutes\n\nThen, A comes back: 1 minute\n\nThen, A and C cross: 5 minutes\n\nThen, A comes back: 1 minute\n\nThen, A and B cross: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 19 minutes\n\nSame again.\n\nWait, is there a way to have someone cross twice?\n\nWait, no, everyone needs to cross to the other side.\n\nWait, perhaps have two people cross, then one comes back, then two others cross, and so on.\n\nWait, I think the 17-minute plan is the best so far.\n\nLet me see if I can find a way to make it 15 minutes.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf I can save 2 minutes somewhere.\n\nWait, what if after the first crossing of A and B: 2 minutes\n\nThen, instead of A coming back, have B stay and A brings the flashlight back: 1 minute\n\nThen, send C and D across: 10 minutes\n\nNow, on the other side, B can bring the flashlight back: 2 minutes\n\nThen, send A and B across again: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes\n\nSame as before.\n\nIs there a way to have A not make one of the return trips?\n\nWait, maybe have A and B cross: 2 minutes\n\nThen, A comes back: 1 minute\n\nThen, A and C cross: 5 minutes\n\nThen, B comes back: 2 minutes\n\nThen, B and D cross: 10 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 10 = 20 minutes\n\nWorse than before.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. A and B cross: 2 minutes\n\n2. A comes back: 1 minute\n\n3. A and D cross: 10 minutes\n\n4. A comes back: 1 minute\n\n5. A and C cross: 5 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 19 minutes\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think 17 minutes is the fastest possible.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I try to have two people cross, then one comes back, then two others cross, and so on.\n\nI need to minimize the time spent on return trips.\n\nSince A is the fastest, having A make the return trips makes sense.\n\nSo, the initial plan seems optimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to have some people cross without needing the flashlight brought back immediately.\n\nWait, for example, have the two slowest cross together: C and D: 10 minutes\n\nThen, B comes back with the flashlight: 2 minutes\n\nThen, A and B cross together: 2 minutes\n\nThen, A comes back: 1 minute\n\nThen, A and C cross: 5 minutes\n\nWait, but C is already on the other side.\n\nWait, no, if C and D have already crossed, then C is already on the other side.\n\nSo, in this case, A and B cross together: 2 minutes\n\nThen, A comes back: 1 minute\n\nThen, A and D cross: 10 minutes\n\nThen, A comes back: 1 minute\n\nThen, A and C cross: 5 minutes\n\nBut D is already on the other side, so maybe I can skip that last step.\n\nWait, no, D is already across, so perhaps:\n\n1. C and D cross together: 10 minutes\n\n2. B comes back: 2 minutes\n\n3. A and B cross together: 2 minutes\n\n4. A comes back: 1 minute\n\n5. A and C cross: 5 minutes\n\nBut C is already across, so maybe skip the last step.\n\nWait, no, C is already across, so perhaps after step 3, everyone is across.\n\nWait, no:\n\n- After step 1: C and D are on the other side.\n\n- Step 2: B crosses back, so now B is back, and C and D are on the other side.\n\n- Step 3: A and B cross together: 2 minutes, so now A and B are on the other side, joining C and D.\n\nSo, everyone is across after step 3.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 2 + 2 = 14 minutes.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nWait a minute, but the flashlight is with A and B after step 3.\n\nEveryone is across, and the flashlight is with them.\n\nSo, yes, that seems to work.\n\nIs this a faster way?\n\n14 minutes, which is faster than the previous 17 minutes.\n\nBut earlier I thought 17 minutes was the fastest.\n\nIs there something wrong with this approach?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nSequence:\n\n1. C and D cross together: 10 minutes\n\n2. B comes back with the flashlight: 2 minutes\n\n3. A and B cross together: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 10 + 2 + 2 = 14 minutes\n\nThat seems to work.\n\nWhy didn't I think of this earlier?\n\nOh, maybe because it's counterintuitive to send the two slowest across first.\n\nBut, in doing so, you can have a faster person bring the flashlight back.\n\nWait, but in this case, B is bringing the flashlight back, which is faster than having A do it, since B is faster than C and D.\n\nWait, no, A is faster than B.\n\nWait, A is 1 minute, B is 2 minutes.\n\nSo, A is faster.\n\nSo, perhaps having B bring the flashlight back is still acceptable, since A is already on the other side.\n\nWait, no, in this sequence, A is crossing with B in step 3, after B has brought the flashlight back.\n\nWait, no, in step 3, A and B are crossing together to the other side, where C and D are already waiting.\n\nSo, yes, after step 3, everyone is on the other side.\n\nAnd the flashlight is with them.\n\nSo, total time is 14 minutes.\n\nIs there any flaw in this plan?\n\nI think this is the optimal solution.\n\nEarlier, I thought 17 minutes was the best, but this seems to be faster.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's a way to make it even faster.\n\nIs there a way to get everyone across in less than 14 minutes?\n\nLet's see.\n\nAnother approach:\n\n1. A and B cross together: 2 minutes\n\n2. A comes back: 1 minute\n\n3. A and C cross: 5 minutes\n\n4. A comes back: 1 minute\n\n5. A and D cross: 10 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes\n\nWorse than 14 minutes.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. A and C cross: 5 minutes\n\n2. A comes back: 1 minute\n\n3. A and D cross: 10 minutes\n\n4. A comes back: 1 minute\n\n5. A and B cross: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 5 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 19 minutes\n\nAgain, worse.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. B and C cross: 5 minutes\n\n2. B comes back: 2 minutes\n\n3. B and D cross: 10 minutes\n\n4. B comes back: 2 minutes\n\n5. A and B cross: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 5 + 2 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 21 minutes\n\nEven worse.\n\nSo, the initial plan of sending the two slowest across first and then having B bring the flashlight back seems to be the optimal solution, with a total time of 14 minutes.\n\nI think that's the fastest possible time for all four people to cross the bridge.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
