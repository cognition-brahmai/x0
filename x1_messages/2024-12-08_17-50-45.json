Currently, the bakery produces 500 loaves of bread per day, with an average weight of 1 pound per loaf. They want to introduce three new types of pastries, with production targets of 200 units for pastry type A, 300 units for pastry type B, and 400 units for pastry type C. Each unit of pastry type A weighs 0.25 pounds, while types B and C weigh 0.5 pounds and 0.75 pounds, respectively. Determine the total daily output in terms of weight for all products combined and calculate the required storage space if each pound of product needs 2 cubic feet of space."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the bakery is expanding by adding three new types of pastries to their menu, and they want to know the total daily output in terms of weight for all their products combined. Also, they need to figure out the required storage space, given that each pound of product needs 2 cubic feet of space.\n\nFirst, let's summarize what we know:\n\n1. **Current production:**\n   - 500 loaves of bread per day\n   - Each loaf weighs 1 pound\n\n2. **New pastries:**\n   - Pastry type A: 200 units, each weighing 0.25 pounds\n   - Pastry type B: 300 units, each weighing 0.5 pounds\n   - Pastry type C: 400 units, each weighing 0.75 pounds\n\nOur tasks are:\na) Calculate the total daily output in weight for all products combined.\nb) Calculate the required storage space based on the total weight and the space requirement per pound.\n\nLet's start with part a).\n\n**Calculating the total daily output in weight:**\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the total weight for each type of product and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Weight of current bread production:**\n   \\[\n   500 \\text{ loaves} \\times 1 \\text{ pound-loaf} = 500 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Weight of pastry type A:**\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ units} \\times 0.25 \\text{ pounds/unit} = 50 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Weight of pastry type B:**\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ units} \\times 0.5 \\text{ pounds/unit} = 150 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Weight of pastry type C:**\n   \\[\n   400 \\text{ units} \\times 0.75 \\text{ pounds/unit} = 300 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's add up all these weights to get the total daily output in weight:\n\n\\[\n500 \\text{ pounds} + 50 \\text{ pounds} + 150 \\text{ pounds} + 300 \\text{ pounds} = 1000 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total daily output in weight for all products combined is 1000 pounds.\n\n**Calculating the required storage space:**\n\nWe're told that each pound of product needs 2 cubic feet of space. Therefore, to find the total storage space required, we multiply the total weight by the space per pound:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\text{ pounds} \\times 2 \\text{ cubic feet/pound} = 2000 \\text{ cubic feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the bakery will need 2000 cubic feet of storage space to accommodate all their daily productions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2000 \\text{ cubic feet}} \\]"
