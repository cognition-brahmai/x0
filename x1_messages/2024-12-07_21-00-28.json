        "content": "Let's see. So, in this game, Tom scores twice as many points as Jerry. The total score is 90, and Jerry scored 30 points. The question is, did Tom win the game? And I need to justify my answer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"winning the game\" means in this context. Usually, in a game, the player with the highest score wins. So, if Tom has more points than Jerry, he wins. But, I need to make sure there aren't any other conditions or players involved.\n\nGiven that Tom scores twice as many points as Jerry, and Jerry scored 30 points, I can calculate Tom's score. Twice 30 is 60, so Tom scored 60 points.\n\nNow, the total score is 90. If Tom scored 60 and Jerry scored 30, that adds up to 90, which matches the total score. So, that seems correct.\n\nNext, to determine if Tom won, I need to see if his score is higher than Jerry's. Tom has 60, Jerry has 30. So, yes, Tom has a higher score.\n\nBut, maybe there are other players. The problem mentions Tom and Jerry, but doesn't specify if there are others. If there are other players, their scores would also matter in determining the winner.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"the total score is 90,\" which includes all players' scores. Since only Tom and Jerry are mentioned, and their scores add up to 90, it's likely that there are no other players.\n\nAlternatively, if there were other players, their combined score would be 90 minus Tom and Jerry's scores, which would be 90 - 60 - 30 = 0. That doesn't make sense, as other players would presumably score some points.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to assume that only Tom and Jerry are playing, and Tom has the higher score.\n\nSo, Tom wins the game.\n\nBut wait, the problem says, \"did Tom win the game?\" It doesn't specify if it's a single-game or multiple-game match. If it's a single game, then yes, Tom wins because he has the higher score.\n\nBut if it's a match consisting of multiple games, then we would need to know who won each game and perhaps see who has the overall lead.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, it seems to be a single game, and Tom has the higher score, so he wins.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if there are any tiebreakers or other conditions for winning. But again, the problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume that the highest score wins.\n\nSo, to conclude, yes, Tom won the game because he scored 60 points, which is higher than Jerry's 30 points, and their total is 90, which matches the total score mentioned.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, Tom won the game.}} \\]"
