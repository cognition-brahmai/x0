        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to implement a simple banking system in Java with classes for Bank, Account, and Customer. The Bank class should be able to hold multiple accounts, each account belongs to a customer and has a balance. I need to implement methods for deposit, withdrawal, and transferring funds between accounts.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the structure of these classes. Let's start with the Customer class. Each customer should have some identifying information, like a name and maybe an ID. Then, the Account class should be associated with a Customer and have a balance that can be deposited to or withdrawn from. Finally, the Bank class should manage multiple accounts.\n\nI should probably use some sort of collection to hold multiple accounts in the Bank class. Maybe a List<Account> would work. And for transferring funds, I need to make sure that both accounts are valid and that the sender has sufficient funds.\n\nLet me sketch out the classes first.\n\nStarting with the Customer class:\n\nclass Customer {\n\n    private String name;\n\n    private int id;\n\n    // constructors, getters, setters\n\n}\n\nThen the Account class:\n\nclass Account {\n\n    private Customer customer;\n\n    private double balance;\n\n    private String accountNumber;\n\n    // constructors, getters, setters, deposit, withdraw\n\n}\n\nAnd the Bank class:\n\nclass Bank {\n\n    private List<Account> accounts;\n\n    // constructors, methods to add account, deposit, withdraw, transfer\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Bank class, I need to be able to identify accounts, maybe by account number. So perhaps Account should have a unique account number.\n\nAlso, for transferring funds, I need to find accounts based on their account numbers.\n\nSo maybe in the Bank class, I should use a Map<String, Account> where the key is the account number.\n\nThat sounds better.\n\nLet me adjust that.\n\nBank class:\n\nclass Bank {\n\n    private Map<String, Account> accounts;\n\n    // constructors, methods to add account, deposit, withdraw, transfer\n\n}\n\nNow, for deposit and withdrawal, I can have methods in the Account class, and the Bank class can call those methods after finding the account by its account number.\n\nFor transferring funds, I need to ensure that both the source and destination accounts exist and that the source account has sufficient funds.\n\nI should also think about error handling. For example, if someone tries to withdraw more than the balance, or if an account doesn't exist.\n\nMaybe I can throw exceptions in such cases.\n\nLet me think about the methods I need.\n\nIn the Bank class:\n\n- addAccount(Account account): adds an account to the bank\n\n- deposit(String accountNumber, double amount): deposits amount to the account\n\n- withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount): withdraws amount from the account\n\n- transfer(String fromAccount, String toAccount, double amount): transfers amount from one account to another\n\nIn the Account class:\n\n- deposit(double amount): adds amount to the balance\n\n- withdraw(double amount): subtracts amount from the balance if sufficient funds\n\nIn the Customer class:\n\n- just properties for name and ID, with getters and setters\n\nI should also make sure that account numbers are unique.\n\nMaybe in the Bank class, when adding an account, I can generate a unique account number.\n\nAlternatively, the account number can be provided when creating the Account object.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to generate it in the Bank class to ensure uniqueness.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume that the account number is provided when creating the Account object, and the bank will check for uniqueness.\n\nWait, no. Let's have the Bank class generate the account number.\n\nThat way, I can ensure uniqueness.\n\nSo, when adding an account to the bank, it assigns a unique account number to it.\n\nI'll need a counter or something similar in the Bank class to generate incremental account numbers.\n\nNow, about the Customer class. Each Account is associated with a Customer.\n\nSo, when creating an Account, I need to associate it with a Customer.\n\nMaybe the Account class should have a reference to a Customer object.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in the Account constructor, I'll pass a Customer object.\n\nNow, for the Bank class, I need to be able to add accounts, but generate account numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps the Bank class should be the one creating Account objects, assigning account numbers, and adding them to its map.\n\nBut to keep it flexible, maybe I'll have the addAccount method that takes a Customer and perhaps an initial balance, creates an Account with a unique account number, and adds it to the map.\n\nAlternatively, the Account class can generate its own account number, but then the Bank class needs to ensure that the account number is unique.\n\nI think it's better for the Bank class to manage account numbers since it's the one holding all the accounts.\n\nSo, in the Bank class, I'll have a private static int accountCounter; that increments each time a new account is added.\n\nThen, the account number can be a string like \"ACC00001\", \"ACC00002\", etc.\n\nFor generating such strings, I can use String.format to pad the account number with zeros.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation step by step.\n\nFirst, the Customer class:\n\npublic class Customer {\n\n    private String name;\n\n    private int id;\n\n    public Customer(String name, int id) {\n\n        this.name = name;\n\n        this.id = id;\n\n    }\n\n    // getters and setters\n\n}\n\nNext, the Account class:\n\npublic class Account {\n\n    private Customer customer;\n\n    private double balance;\n\n    private String accountNumber;\n\n    public Account(Customer customer, String accountNumber) {\n\n        this.customer = customer;\n\n        this.balance = 0.0;\n\n        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n\n        if (amount > 0) {\n\n            balance += amount;\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n\n        if (amount > 0) {\n\n            if (balance >= amount) {\n\n                balance -= amount;\n\n            } else {\n\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // getters for customer, balance, accountNumber\n\n}\n\nThen, the Bank class:\n\npublic class Bank {\n\n    private Map<String, Account> accounts = new HashMap<>();\n\n    private static int accountCounter = 1;\n\n    public void addAccount(Customer customer) {\n\n        String accountNumber = String.format(\"ACC%05d\", accountCounter++);\n\n        Account newAccount = new Account(customer, accountNumber);\n\n        accounts.put(accountNumber, newAccount);\n\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n\n        Account account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n\n        if (account != null) {\n\n            account.deposit(amount);\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n\n        Account account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n\n        if (account != null) {\n\n            account.withdraw(amount);\n\n        } else {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public void transfer(String fromAccount, String toAccount, double amount) {\n\n        if (fromAccount.equals(toAccount)) {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Source and destination accounts cannot be the same.\");\n\n        }\n\n        Account from = accounts.get(fromAccount);\n\n        Account to = accounts.get(toAccount);\n\n        if (from == null || to == null) {\n\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"One or both accounts not found.\");\n\n        }\n\n        from.withdraw(amount);\n\n        to.deposit(amount);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements.\n\nNow, to test this, I can write a simple main method.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        Bank bank = new Bank();\n\n        Customer cust1 = new Customer(\"Alice\", 1);\n\n        Customer cust2 = new Customer(\"Bob\", 2);\n\n        bank.addAccount(cust1);\n\n        bank.addAccount(cust2);\n\n        String aliceAccount = \"ACC00001\";\n\n        String bobAccount = \"ACC00002\";\n\n        bank.deposit(aliceAccount, 1000.0);\n\n        bank.transfer(aliceAccount, bobAccount, 200.0);\n\n        // check balances\n\n        Account aliceAcc = bank.accounts.get(aliceAccount);\n\n        Account bobAcc = bank.accounts.get(bobAccount);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Alice's balance: \" + aliceAcc.getBalance());\n\n        System.out.println(\"Bob's balance: \" + bobAcc.getBalance());\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis should output:\n\nAlice's balance: 800.0\n\nBob's balance: 200.0\n\nI need to make sure to add getters in the Account class for balance and accountNumber.\n\nAlso, perhaps add a method in Account to get the customer's name or id.\n\nAlternatively, I can add a getCustomer method in Account that returns the Customer object.\n\nThen, in the main method, I can access the customer's name through the Account object.\n\nWait, but in the transfer method, do I need to know the customer information? Maybe not, since transactions are based on account numbers.\n\nBut it might be useful for reporting or displaying account holder names.\n\nSo, I'll add a getCustomer method in Account that returns the Customer object.\n\nThen, in the Customer class, I can have getters for name and id.\n\nAlright, I think this is a good starting point.\n\nI might need to add more error checking or features, but for a simple banking system, this should work.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement a simple banking system in Java, we need to create classes for `Bank`, `Account`, and `Customer`. The `Bank` class manages multiple accounts, each associated with a `Customer` and holding a balance. We will implement methods for deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer between accounts.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Customer Class**: Holds customer information like name and ID.\n2. **Account Class**: Associated with a `Customer`, holds a balance, and allows deposit and withdrawal operations.\n3. **Bank Class**: Manages multiple accounts using a `Map` for quick look-up by account number. Provides methods to add accounts, deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass Customer {\n    private String name;\n    private int id;\n\n    public Customer(String name, int id) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Account {\n    private Customer customer;\n    private double balance;\n    private String accountNumber;\n\n    public Account(Customer customer, String accountNumber) {\n        this.customer = customer;\n        this.balance = 0.0;\n        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balance += amount;\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            if (balance >= amount) {\n                balance -= amount;\n            } else {\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n            }\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public Customer getCustomer() {\n        return customer;\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n\n    public String getAccountNumber() {\n        return accountNumber;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Bank {\n    private Map<String, Account> accounts = new HashMap<>();\n    private static int accountCounter = 1;\n\n    public void addAccount(Customer customer) {\n        String accountNumber = String.format(\"ACC%05d\", accountCounter++);\n        Account newAccount = new Account(customer, accountNumber);\n        accounts.put(accountNumber, newAccount);\n    }\n\n    public void deposit(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        Account account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            account.deposit(amount);\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount) {\n        Account account = accounts.get(accountNumber);\n        if (account != null) {\n            account.withdraw(amount);\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Account not found.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void transfer(String fromAccount, String toAccount, double amount) {\n        if (fromAccount.equals(toAccount)) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Source and destination accounts cannot be the same.\");\n        }\n        Account from = accounts.get(fromAccount);\n        Account to = accounts.get(toAccount);\n        if (from == null || to == null) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"One or both accounts not found.\");\n        }\n        from.withdraw(amount);\n        to.deposit(amount);\n    }\n\n    public Account getAccount(String accountNumber) {\n        return accounts.get(accountNumber);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Bank bank = new Bank();\n\n        Customer cust1 = new Customer(\"Alice\", 1);\n        Customer cust2 = new Customer(\"Bob\", 2);\n\n        bank.addAccount(cust1);\n        bank.addAccount(cust2);\n\n        String aliceAccount = \"ACC00001\";\n        String bobAccount = \"ACC00002\";\n\n        bank.deposit(aliceAccount, 1000.0);\n        bank.transfer(aliceAccount, bobAccount, 200.0);\n\n        // Check balances\n        Account aliceAcc = bank.getAccount(aliceAccount);\n        Account bobAcc = bank.getAccount(bobAccount);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Alice's balance: \" + aliceAcc.getBalance());\n        System.out.println(\"Bob's balance: \" + bobAcc.getBalance());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Customer Class**: \n   - Holds the name and ID of the customer.\n   - Getters for name and ID.\n\n2. **Account Class**:\n   - Associated with a `Customer` and has a balance and account number.\n   - Methods to deposit and withdraw money with necessary validations.\n\n3. **Bank Class**:\n   - Manages accounts using a `Map` with account numbers as keys.\n   - Generates unique account numbers for new accounts.\n   - Methods to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds with error handling for invalid operations.\n\n4. **Main Class**:\n   - Demonstrates the usage of the banking system by creating customers, adding accounts, performing deposits, transfers, and checking balances."
