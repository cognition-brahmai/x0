        "content": "So there's a class with 30 students, and 15 of them are boys. That means the rest, which would be 30 minus 15, equals 15 girls. Now, half of the boys have brown eyes. So, if there are 15 boys and half of them have brown eyes, that means 15 divided by 2 equals 7.5. But since we can't have half a person, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. If half of the boys have brown eyes, then the other half must have a different eye color, right? So, if there are 15 boys and half of them have brown eyes, then the number of boys with brown eyes is 15 divided by 2, which is 7.5. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because you can't have half a person.\n\nMaybe the problem assumes that exactly half have brown eyes, meaning 7 or 8 boys, but that would be ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps it's intended to be exactly half, so 7.5, but since that's not possible, maybe the problem has a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that approximately half have brown eyes. In that case, the number of boys with brown eyes is about half of 15, which is 7.5, but since we can't have half a person, perhaps it's 7 or 8 boys with brown eyes.\n\nBut the question is: how many boys do not have brown eyes? If half have brown eyes, then the other half must have a different eye color. So, if 7 boys have brown eyes, then 15 minus 7 equals 8 boys without brown eyes. Alternatively, if 8 boys have brown eyes, then 15 minus 8 equals 7 boys without brown eyes.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing because of the half person issue. Maybe I should consider that \"half\" is meant to be exactly half, and since 15 is an odd number, perhaps the problem isn't set up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number. So, half of 15 is 7.5, which rounds to 8. Therefore, 8 boys have brown eyes, and 15 minus 8 equals 7 boys without brown eyes.\n\nBut I think the precise mathematical answer would be that half of 15 is 7.5, which isn't possible in reality, so perhaps the problem is hypothetical or needs to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to teach that when dealing with halves of odd numbers, we need to consider rounding or practical implications.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is that 7.5 boys have brown eyes, but since we can't have half a person, in reality, it would be either 7 or 8 boys with brown eyes, corresponding to 8 or 7 boys without brown eyes, respectively.\n\nBut since the problem says \"half of the boys have brown eyes,\" and 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, perhaps the expected answer is that 7.5 boys have brown eyes, and thus 7.5 boys do not have brown eyes. But that doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that half of the boys, rounded down, have brown eyes, so 7 boys have brown eyes, and the remaining 8 do not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's intended to be exact, and the class has an even number of boys, but in this case, it's 15, which is odd.\n\nI think the most reasonable approach is to acknowledge that half of 15 is 7.5, which suggests that either 7 or 8 boys have brown eyes, depending on how the half is rounded.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys without brown eyes would be either 8 or 7, respectively.\n\nBut since the problem says \"half of the boys have brown eyes,\" and 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, perhaps the answer should be expressed as 7.5 boys do not have brown eyes, understanding that in reality, it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be straightforward, with half of 15 being 7.5, and thus 7.5 boys do not have brown eyes.\n\nBut since we can't have half a person, maybe the problem is flawed or needs more information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as 7 boys have brown eyes and 8 do not, or vice versa, but without further specification, it's ambiguous.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is that 7.5 boys do not have brown eyes, but in reality, it would be either 7 or 8 boys, depending on how the half is apportioned.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.5} \\]"
