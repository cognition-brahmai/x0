        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a farmer who has both chickens and cows on his farm. He counts a total of 36 heads and 100 legs. We need to figure out how many chickens and how many cows there are.\n\nFirst, I think we should consider what we know about chickens and cows. Chickens have 1 head and 2 legs, right? And cows have 1 head and 4 legs. So, each animal has one head, but the number of legs differs between chickens and cows.\n\nSince there are a total of 36 heads, that means there are 36 animals in total, because each animal has one head. So, if we let\u2019s say, C represents the number of chickens and K represents the number of cows, then:\n\nC + K = 36\n\nThat's our first equation.\n\nNow, for the legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 100. So, the total legs can be represented as:\n\n2C + 4K = 100\n\nThat's our second equation.\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) C + K = 36\n\n2) 2C + 4K = 100\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of C and K.\n\nOne way to solve this is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for C:\n\nC = 36 - K\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for C into the second equation:\n\n2(36 - K) + 4K = 100\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n72 - 2K + 4K = 100\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n72 + 2K = 100\n\nNow, subtract 72 from both sides:\n\n2K = 28\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nK = 14\n\nSo, there are 14 cows.\n\nNow, plug this back into the first equation to find C:\n\nC = 36 - 14 = 22\n\nTherefore, there are 22 chickens and 14 cows.\n\nBut, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If there are 22 chickens, that's 22 heads and 44 legs (since each chicken has 2 legs). For the 14 cows, that's 14 heads and 56 legs (since each cow has 4 legs). Adding them up: 22 + 14 = 36 heads, and 44 + 56 = 100 legs. Perfect, it matches the given totals.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is by using the concept of average legs per animal. Since there are 100 legs for 36 animals, the average number of legs per animal is 100 / 36, which is approximately 2.777 legs per animal. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4, the average suggests that there are more chickens than cows, which aligns with our solution of 22 chickens and 14 cows.\n\nAnother method could be to assume all animals are chickens, then see how many additional legs are accounted for by replacing chickens with cows. If all 36 animals were chickens, there would be 36 * 2 = 72 legs. But there are 100 legs, which is 28 legs short. Since each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken, we would need 28 / 2 = 14 cows to make up for the extra legs. Then, the number of chickens would be 36 - 14 = 22, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method we choose, we arrive at the same conclusion: there are 22 chickens and 14 cows on the farm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22 \\text{ chickens and } 14 \\text{ cows}} \\]"
