        "content": "Let's see. So, Alice has twice as many apples as Bob, and Bob has 3 more apples than Carol. Together, they have 21 apples. I need to find out how many apples Alice has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to the number of apples each person has. Let's say:\n\n- Let C represent the number of apples Carol has.\n\n- Since Bob has 3 more apples than Carol, Bob has C + 3 apples.\n\n- Alice has twice as many apples as Bob, so Alice has 2 times (C + 3), which is 2(C + 3).\n\nNow, together they have 21 apples, so the sum of their apples should be 21:\n\nC + (C + 3) + 2(C + 3) = 21\n\nI need to solve this equation for C.\n\nFirst, I'll expand the equation:\n\nC + C + 3 + 2C + 6 = 21\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC + C + 2C is 4C, and 3 + 6 is 9, so:\n\n4C + 9 = 21\n\nNow, subtract 9 from both sides:\n\n4C = 12\n\nThen, divide both sides by 4:\n\nC = 3\n\nSo, Carol has 3 apples.\n\nNow, Bob has C + 3, which is 3 + 3 = 6 apples.\n\nAlice has twice as many as Bob, so 2 * 6 = 12 apples.\n\nLet me check if this adds up to 21:\n\n3 (Carol) + 6 (Bob) + 12 (Alice) = 21\n\nYes, it does.\n\nSo, Alice has 12 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
