The expression is:\n\n(4^2 - 3) / (2 + 1)^2 - 7\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the exponentiation, then subtraction and addition, and finally division and subtraction, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).\n\nSo, starting with the exponentiation:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nAnd (2 + 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9\n\nNow, plug these values back into the expression:\n\n(16 - 3) / 9 - 7\n\nNext, do the subtraction inside the parentheses:\n\n16 - 3 = 13\n\nSo now it's:\n\n13 / 9 - 7\n\nThen, perform the division:\n\n13 divided by 9 is approximately 1.4444\n\nSo:\n\n1.4444 - 7\n\nFinally, subtract 7:\n\n1.4444 - 7 = -5.5556\n\nTherefore, the result is approximately -5.5556.\n\nBut to be precise, 13 divided by 9 is 13/9, which is approximately 1.4444, but keeping it as a fraction would be better for accuracy.\n\nSo, 13/9 - 7 = 13/9 - 63/9 = (13 - 63)/9 = -50/9\n\n-50/9 is approximately -5.5556, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is -50/9 or approximately -5.5556.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-\\dfrac{50}{9}} \\]"
