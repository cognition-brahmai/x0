        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a bottle fills up a glass 8 times, and each glass holds 250 milliliters of water. I need to find out how many liters of water the bottle holds. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The bottle fills up a glass 8 times, meaning that the bottle contains enough water to fill that glass 8 times. Each glass holds 250 milliliters, so I need to find out the total volume of water in the bottle in liters.\n\nAlright, so the first step is to find out the total volume of water in the bottle in milliliters. Since each glass is 250 milliliters and the bottle fills 8 glasses, I can multiply 250 milliliters by 8.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n250 milliliters/glass \u00d7 8 glasses = 2000 milliliters\n\nSo, the bottle holds 2000 milliliters of water.\n\nNow, the question asks for the volume in liters, not milliliters. I know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. Therefore, to convert milliliters to liters, I need to divide the volume in milliliters by 1000.\n\nSo, 2000 milliliters \u00f7 1000 = 2 liters\n\nTherefore, the bottle holds 2 liters of water.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I multiplied 250 by 8 to get 2000 milliliters, which seems correct. Then, converting milliliters to liters by dividing by 1000, which also seems right, giving me 2 liters. Yeah, that sounds good.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe I can think in terms of units. Since 1 liter is 1000 milliliters, each glass holds 250 milliliters, which is 0.25 liters. Then, if the bottle fills 8 glasses, I can multiply 0.25 liters/glass by 8 glasses.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n0.25 liters/glass \u00d7 8 glasses = 2 liters\n\nSo, I get the same answer again. That gives me more confidence that 2 liters is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many glasses are in a liter. Since each glass is 250 milliliters, and 1 liter is 1000 milliliters, then 1 liter divided by 250 milliliters/glass equals 4 glasses per liter.\n\nSo, if there are 4 glasses in 1 liter, and the bottle fills 8 glasses, then the bottle holds 8 glasses \u00f7 4 glasses/liter = 2 liters.\n\nAgain, the same answer. It's good to see that no matter which way I approach it, I end up with 2 liters.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should make sure that all my units are consistent. I started with milliliters and converted to liters, which is fine. Alternatively, I could have worked entirely in liters from the beginning, but milliliters are easier to work with in this case.\n\nAlso, I should check if there's any possibility of misinterpretation in the problem. The statement says \"a bottle fills up a glass 8 times.\" Does that mean that the bottle is filled 8 times to fill the glass, or that the bottle fills the glass 8 times? The way it's worded, it's the latter: the bottle fills the glass 8 times. So, the bottle is being used to fill the glass repeatedly, 8 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, re-reading it, \"a bottle fills up a glass 8 times.\" This could be ambiguous. Does it mean that the bottle fills the glass 8 times, or that the bottle is filled up 8 times to fill the glass?\n\nLet me think about this. If the bottle fills up a glass 8 times, it probably means that the bottle is used to fill the glass 8 times. But, if the bottle is being used to fill the glass multiple times, does that mean that the bottle is being replenished each time, or that it holds enough to fill the glass 8 times without being replenished?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: the bottle is used to fill the glass 8 times, meaning that the bottle holds enough to fill the glass 8 times without being replenished. In this case, my earlier calculation stands: bottle volume = 8 \u00d7 250 milliliters = 2000 milliliters = 2 liters.\n\nSecond interpretation: the bottle is filled up 8 times to fill the glass. This would mean that the glass is being filled by 8 separate bottles, or that the bottle is being refilled 8 times to fill one glass. This seems less likely, as it would imply that the glass requires 8 bottles to fill it, which doesn't make much sense because a glass is typically smaller than a bottle.\n\nGiven that a glass holds 250 milliliters, which is less than a typical bottle of water, it's more plausible that the bottle is larger and can fill the glass multiple times. Therefore, the first interpretation makes more sense.\n\nSo, sticking with the first interpretation, the bottle holds 2 liters of water.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
