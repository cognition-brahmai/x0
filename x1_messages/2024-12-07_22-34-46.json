        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a man has 8 pairs of socks in his drawer, but they're all mixed up. He wants to pick socks randomly without looking and needs to know how many he has to pick to guarantee that he gets at least one matching pair. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. He has 8 pairs, which means 16 individual socks. But they're all mixed up, so he doesn't know which ones match which. He's picking randomly without looking, and he wants to ensure that he gets at least one matching pair.\n\nSo, the goal is to find the minimum number of socks he needs to pick to be certain that among them, there are at least two that match.\n\nI think this is a problem related to the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle is a simple concept that says if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole will have more than one pigeon. In this context, the \"pigeonholes\" would be the different pairs of socks, and the \"pigeons\" are the socks being picked.\n\nLet me try to apply this.\n\nHe has 8 pairs of socks, so there are 8 different \"pigeonholes\" or categories (each pair being a category).\n\nIf he picks 8 socks, it's possible that he could have one sock from each pair, right? So, no matching pair yet.\n\nBut if he picks one more sock, that's the 9th sock, it has to match one of the previous 8 socks because there are only 8 pairs.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, he picks one sock from each pair first, and the next sock he picks will match one of them.\n\nTherefore, he needs to pick 9 socks to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this.\n\nSuppose he picks 8 socks, and each one is from a different pair. That's possible, right? So, no matches yet.\n\nBut when he picks the 9th sock, it has to match one of the first 8 because there are only 8 pairs.\n\nSo, yes, 9 socks guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nIs there a chance that he could get a matching pair before picking 9 socks?\n\nYes, definitely. He might get a matching pair in the first two socks he picks, if he's lucky.\n\nBut the question is about guaranteeing it, meaning it has to be true no matter what, so we need to consider the worst-case scenario.\n\nIn the worst case, he could pick one sock from each pair first, and only the next sock guarantees a match.\n\nSo, 9 socks are needed to guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose he has 8 pairs of different colors or patterns or something. Each pair is identical, but different from the others.\n\nSo, if he picks 8 socks, each of a different \"pair,\" no matches.\n\nThe 9th sock has to match one of them.\n\nAlternatively, if he picks more than 8, say 9, then since there are only 8 pairs, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one pair must have two socks picked.\n\nTherefore, 9 socks guarantee at least one matching pair.\n\nI think this makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or if the scenario changes with more information.\n\nBut given the information, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer should be 9 socks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
