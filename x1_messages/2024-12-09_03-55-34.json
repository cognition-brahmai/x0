        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a box with red and blue balls, and apparently, there are twice as many red balls as blue balls initially. Then, if we remove 10 red balls and add 5 blue balls, the number of red and blue balls becomes equal. We need to find out how many balls were in the box at the start.\n\nFirst, let's assign some variables to make this easier. Let\u2019s say the number of blue balls initially in the box is B. Since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, the number of red balls would be 2B.\n\nSo, initially, we have:\n- Red balls: 2B\n- Blue balls: B\n- Total balls: 2B + B = 3B\n\nNow, according to the problem, if we take out 10 red balls and add 5 blue balls, the number of red and blue balls becomes equal.\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens to the number of red and blue balls after these changes:\n\n- Red balls after removing 10: 2B - 10\n- Blue balls after adding 5: B + 5\n\nAnd these two quantities are equal:\n\n2B - 10 = B + 5\n\nNow, we can solve this equation for B.\n\nSubtract B from both sides:\n\n2B - B - 10 = B - B + 5\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nB - 10 = 5\n\nNow, add 10 to both sides:\n\nB - 10 + 10 = 5 + 10\n\nSo:\n\nB = 15\n\nAlright, so initially, there were 15 blue balls. Since there were twice as many red balls as blue balls, the number of red balls was 2 * 15 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls initially in the box was 30 red + 15 blue = 45 balls.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf we start with 30 red and 15 blue balls, and we remove 10 red balls, we have 30 - 10 = 20 red balls left.\n\nThen, we add 5 blue balls, so the blue balls become 15 + 5 = 20.\n\nYes, now there are 20 red and 20 blue balls, which matches the condition that they are equal.\n\nSo, the initial total number of balls was indeed 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
