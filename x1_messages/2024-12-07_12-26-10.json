        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces widgets at a rate of 500 per hour. They're planning to increase production by 20% every week for the next four weeks. We need to find out how many widgets will be produced in the fourth week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% increase means in this context. If they produce 500 widgets per hour initially, a 20% increase would mean they're adding another 20% of 500 to the production rate each week.\n\nBut wait, the problem says they're increasing production by 20% every week. So, does that mean each week's production is 20% more than the previous week's?\n\nYes, that's what it sounds like. So, it's a compounded increase week over week.\n\nLet me confirm the initial production rate. 500 widgets per hour. But I need to know how many hours they work in a week to calculate the total weekly production.\n\nHmm, the problem doesn't specify the number of hours they work per week. Maybe I can assume a standard workweek, like 40 hours?\n\nBut actually, perhaps I don't need to assume the number of hours per week because the increase is applied to the hourly rate, and then I can calculate the weekly production based on that.\n\nWait, no. The increase is probably on the total weekly production, not the hourly rate. But the problem says they increase the production rate by 20% every week.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"They decide to increase production by 20% every week for the next 4 weeks.\"\n\nSo, it's the production rate that increases by 20% each week.\n\nAlright, so the production rate starts at 500 widgets per hour. After the first week, it increases by 20%, so the new rate is 500 plus 20% of 500, which is 500 + 100 = 600 widgets per hour.\n\nThen, in the second week, it increases by another 20% based on the new rate of 600, so 600 + 20% of 600 = 600 + 120 = 720 widgets per hour.\n\nSimilarly, in the third week, it's 720 + 20% of 720 = 720 + 144 = 864 widgets per hour.\n\nAnd in the fourth week, it's 864 + 20% of 864 = 864 + 172.8 = 1036.8 widgets per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but this seems a bit tedious to calculate each step manually. Maybe there's a better way to calculate the production rate after four weeks of 20% increases.\n\nI recall that compounded growth can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1 + growth rate)^number of periods\n\nIn this case, the initial production rate is 500 widgets per hour, the growth rate is 20% or 0.2, and the number of periods is 4 weeks.\n\nSo, the production rate after 4 weeks would be:\n\n500 * (1 + 0.2)^4 = 500 * (1.2)^4\n\nLet me calculate (1.2)^4.\n\n1.2^1 = 1.2\n\n1.2^2 = 1.44\n\n1.2^3 = 1.728\n\n1.2^4 = 2.0736\n\nSo, the production rate after 4 weeks is 500 * 2.0736 = 1036.8 widgets per hour.\n\nWait, that matches what I calculated earlier, step by step.\n\nNow, to find out how many widgets are produced in the fourth week, I need to know how many hours are worked in that week.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the number of hours per week. Maybe I can assume a standard 40-hour workweek.\n\nSo, if they work 40 hours in the fourth week, the total production would be:\n\n1036.8 widgets per hour * 40 hours = 41,472 widgets.\n\nBut perhaps they work more or less hours. Maybe I should check if there's information about the number of hours.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify the number of hours per week. Maybe the production rate is given per hour, but the increase is applied to the weekly production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production rate increases each week, and I need to calculate the weekly production based on the hourly rate and the number of hours worked that week.\n\nBut without knowing the number of hours worked each week, I might have to assume a constant number of hours per week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increase is applied to the total weekly production, not the hourly rate.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose the initial weekly production is based on a certain number of hours, and then each week, that weekly production is increased by 20%.\n\nIn that case, I can calculate the weekly production after each increase.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the initial weekly production as W0.\n\nThen, after the first week, the production is W1 = W0 * 1.2\n\nAfter the second week, W2 = W1 * 1.2 = W0 * 1.2^2\n\nAfter the third week, W3 = W2 * 1.2 = W0 * 1.2^3\n\nAfter the fourth week, W4 = W3 * 1.2 = W0 * 1.2^4\n\nSo, the production in the fourth week would be W4 = W0 * 1.2^4\n\nBut I need to find W4, and I need to know W0, the initial weekly production.\n\nTo find W0, I need to know the number of hours worked per week.\n\nLet\u2019s assume they work 40 hours per week.\n\nThen, W0 = 500 widgets/hour * 40 hours/week = 20,000 widgets/week\n\nThen, W4 = 20,000 * 1.2^4 = 20,000 * 2.0736 = 41,472 widgets\n\nWait, that's the same result as before.\n\nBut perhaps they don't work 40 hours per week. Maybe they work different hours each week.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's safe to assume a constant 40-hour workweek.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increase is applied to the hourly rate, and then the weekly production is based on that new rate times the number of hours worked.\n\nIn that case, it's similar to what I did earlier.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I increased the hourly rate by 20% each week, and then calculated the weekly production based on that rate and 40 hours.\n\nThat gave me the same result as increasing the initial weekly production by 20% each week for four weeks.\n\nSo, either way, I end up with the same calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of widgets produced in the fourth week is 41,472.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nLet me consider if the increase is applied to the total weekly production rather than the hourly rate.\n\nIf the initial hourly rate is 500 widgets/hour, and they work 40 hours per week, then W0 = 20,000 widgets.\n\nThen, each week, the weekly production increases by 20%.\n\nSo, W1 = 20,000 * 1.2 = 24,000\n\nW2 = 24,000 * 1.2 = 28,800\n\nW3 = 28,800 * 1.2 = 34,560\n\nW4 = 34,560 * 1.2 = 41,472\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the hourly rate increases by 20% each week, and they work the same number of hours each week, then:\n\nHourly rate week 1: 500\n\nHourly rate week 2: 500 * 1.2 = 600\n\nHourly rate week 3: 600 * 1.2 = 720\n\nHourly rate week 4: 720 * 1.2 = 864\n\nThen, if they work 40 hours in week 4, production in week 4 is 864 * 40 = 34,560 widgets.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous calculation.\n\nHold on, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nIn the first approach, I increased the weekly production by 20% each week, leading to W4 = 20,000 * 1.2^4 = 41,472\n\nIn the second approach, I increased the hourly rate by 20% each week, leading to an hourly rate in week 4 of 500 * 1.2^3 = 864 (since first increase is at the end of week 1, leading to week 2's rate, etc.), and then production in week 4 is 864 * 40 = 34,560\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion stems from when the increases are applied.\n\nIf the production rate increases by 20% every week, does that mean the increase is applied at the end of each week for the following week, or does it mean that the production rate for each week is increased by 20% over the previous week?\n\nIn the first approach, I considered the weekly production increasing by 20% each week, compounded.\n\nIn the second approach, I considered the hourly rate increasing by 20% each week, compounded, and then calculated the weekly production based on the hourly rate for that week.\n\nBut according to the problem: \"they decide to increase production by 20% every week for the next 4 weeks.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted as increasing the weekly production by 20% each week, which would mean that each week's total production is 20% more than the previous week's total production.\n\nAlternatively, it could be interpreted as increasing the production rate (hourly rate) by 20% each week.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, both interpretations could be valid, but they lead to different answers.\n\nPerhaps the key is to determine which interpretation aligns best with the problem's wording.\n\nThe problem says \"increase production by 20% every week.\" Production could refer to the total weekly production or the production rate per hour.\n\nGiven that the initial production rate is given in widgets per hour, it might make more sense to interpret the increase as applying to the hourly rate.\n\nMoreover, if the increase is applied to the hourly rate, and the number of hours worked per week is constant, then the total weekly production would increase by the same percentage each week.\n\nWait a second, if the hourly rate increases by 20% each week and the number of hours worked is constant, then the total weekly production would indeed increase by 20% each week.\n\nSo, in this case, both interpretations lead to the same result: the total weekly production increases by 20% each week.\n\nTherefore, whether I increase the hourly rate by 20% each week or increase the total weekly production by 20% each week, the end result should be the same.\n\nBut in my earlier calculations, I got different numbers for the fourth week's production using these two methods.\n\nThat suggests I might have made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the first approach.\n\nInitial weekly production, W0 = 500 widgets/hour * 40 hours/week = 20,000 widgets/week\n\nAfter week 1: W1 = W0 * 1.2 = 20,000 * 1.2 = 24,000\n\nAfter week 2: W2 = W1 * 1.2 = 24,000 * 1.2 = 28,800\n\nAfter week 3: W3 = W2 * 1.2 = 28,800 * 1.2 = 34,560\n\nAfter week 4: W4 = W3 * 1.2 = 34,560 * 1.2 = 41,472\n\nNow, in the second approach:\n\nInitial hourly rate: 500 widgets/hour\n\nAfter week 1: hourly rate increases by 20%, so new rate = 500 * 1.2 = 600 widgets/hour\n\nAfter week 2: 600 * 1.2 = 720 widgets/hour\n\nAfter week 3: 720 * 1.2 = 864 widgets/hour\n\nAfter week 4: 864 * 1.2 = 1,036.8 widgets/hour\n\nThen, weekly production in week 4 = 1,036.8 * 40 = 41,472 widgets\n\nWait, now that I recalculate it this way, both approaches give the same result: 41,472 widgets in the fourth week.\n\nSo, earlier, I mistakenly calculated the hourly rate for week 4 as 864, but actually, after four increases of 20%, the hourly rate should be 500 * 1.2^4 = 500 * 2.0736 = 1,036.8 widgets/hour\n\nThen, 1,036.8 * 40 = 41,472\n\nTherefore, the correct number of widgets produced in the fourth week is 41,472.\n\nI must have made an error in my earlier calculation of the hourly rate after four increases.\n\nSo, the final answer is 41,472 widgets produced in the fourth week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41472} \\]"
