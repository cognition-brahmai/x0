        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A group of people wants to split a bill evenly. The total bill amount is $240, and each person pays $30. I need to figure out how many people are in the group.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, the total bill is $240, and each person pays $30. I need to find out how many people are sharing this bill.\n\nI think this is a division problem. If each person pays $30, and the total is $240, then the number of people should be the total bill divided by what each person pays. So, 240 divided by 30.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 240 divided by 30.\n\nWell, 30 times 8 is 240. So, 240 divided by 30 is 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 people in the group.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If 8 people each pay $30, then 8 times 30 is 240, which matches the total bill. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using multiplication or something else.\n\nSuppose I let the number of people be x. Then, each person pays $30, so the total amount would be 30 times x, and that equals $240.\n\nSo, 30x = 240.\n\nTo find x, I divide both sides by 30.\n\nx = 240 / 30.\n\nAgain, that's 8.\n\nSo, whether I think of it as division or solving for x in an equation, I get the same answer.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe if there was a tip involved or something, but the problem doesn't mention any additional costs.\n\nIt seems straightforward. The total bill is $240, each person pays $30, so the number of people is 8.\n\nLet me consider if there could be any fractional people, which doesn't make sense, so it's probably a whole number.\n\nYes, 8 is a whole number, so that fits.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
