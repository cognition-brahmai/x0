        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses in the village, and each house has 4 walls. So, total walls would be 10 houses times 4 walls per house, which is 40 walls. Now, each wall has one window, so there are 40 windows in total. And since a bird sits on every window, there should be 40 birds sitting in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check. Houses have 4 walls each, and each wall has one window. So, for each house, number of birds would be equal to the number of walls, which is 4. Therefore, for 10 houses, it should be 10 times 4, which is indeed 40.\n\nHmm, but I've heard similar riddles before where there might be shared walls or something like that. But in this case, the problem says each house has 4 walls, so I think it's safe to assume that they are separate houses with no shared walls.\n\nAlso, it mentions that a bird sits on every window, so presumably, there's one bird per window.\n\nSo, my final answer is 40 birds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
