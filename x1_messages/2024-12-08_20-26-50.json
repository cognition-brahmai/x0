        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a bacteria culture that doubles its population every hour. Starting with 100 bacteria, I need to figure out how many there will be after one day. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked.\n\nA day has 24 hours, right? So if the bacteria double every hour, that means their population multiplies by 2 each hour. Starting with 100, after one hour it's 200, after two hours it's 400, and so on. I need to calculate this for 24 hours.\n\nI think this is an example of exponential growth, where the population at any time is the initial amount multiplied by the growth rate raised to the power of the number of time periods. In this case, the growth rate is 2 (doubling), and the time period is hours.\n\nSo, the formula should be:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times 2^{t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the population after time \\( t \\),\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population,\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time in hours.\n\nGiven that \\( P_0 = 100 \\) and \\( t = 24 \\), plugging these values in:\n\n\\[ P = 100 \\times 2^{24} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 2^{24} \\). Let's see, \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\), so \\( 2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = 1024^2 \\). But that might be a bit messy to calculate manually. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it step by step. Starting with 100, double it every hour for 24 hours.\n\nHour 0: 100\n\nHour 1: 200\n\nHour 2: 400\n\nHour 3: 800\n\nHour 4: 1600\n\nHour 5: 3200\n\nHour 6: 6400\n\nHour 7: 12800\n\nHour 8: 25600\n\nHour 9: 51200\n\nHour 10: 102400\n\nHour 11: 204800\n\nHour 12: 409600\n\nHour 13: 819200\n\nHour 14: 1638400\n\nHour 15: 3276800\n\nHour 16: 6553600\n\nHour 17: 13107200\n\nHour 18: 26214400\n\nHour 19: 52428800\n\nHour 20: 104857600\n\nHour 21: 209715200\n\nHour 22: 419430400\n\nHour 23: 838860800\n\nHour 24: 1677721600\n\nSo, after 24 hours, the population would be 1,677,721,600 bacteria.\n\nBut wait, is there a more efficient way to calculate this without listing every hour? Yeah, probably using the formula I mentioned earlier.\n\nLet me verify that.\n\n\\[ P = 100 \\times 2^{24} \\]\n\nI know that \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\), so \\( 2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = 1024^2 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( 1024^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 1024 \\times 1024 = 1,048,576 \\]\n\nThen, \\( 2^{24} = 2^{20} \\times 2^{4} = 1,048,576 \\times 16 \\)\n\n\\[ 1,048,576 \\times 16 = 16,777,216 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P = 100 \\times 16,777,216 = 1,677,721,600 \\]\n\nThat matches what I got from listing each hour. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for exponential growth:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times e^{rt} \\]\n\nBut in this case, since it's doubling every hour, the base is 2, not e. So the first formula is more appropriate.\n\nIt's important to note that this assumes unlimited resources and no constraints on growth, which isn't always realistic, but for the purposes of this problem, we'll go with the exponential model.\n\nSo, after one day, or 24 hours, the bacteria population would be 1,677,721,600.\n\nWait a minute, that's over 1.6 billion bacteria starting from just 100. That seems like a lot, but exponential growth can be surprising.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 100, doubling every hour:\n\nAfter 1 hour: 100 * 2 = 200\n\nAfter 2 hours: 200 * 2 = 400\n\nAfter 3 hours: 400 * 2 = 800\n\nAfter 4 hours: 800 * 2 = 1600\n\nAfter 5 hours: 1600 * 2 = 3200\n\nAfter 6 hours: 3200 * 2 = 6400\n\nAfter 7 hours: 6400 * 2 = 12800\n\nAfter 8 hours: 12800 * 2 = 25600\n\nAfter 9 hours: 25600 * 2 = 51200\n\nAfter 10 hours: 51200 * 2 = 102400\n\nAfter 11 hours: 102400 * 2 = 204800\n\nAfter 12 hours: 204800 * 2 = 409600\n\nAfter 13 hours: 409600 * 2 = 819200\n\nAfter 14 hours: 819200 * 2 = 1638400\n\nAfter 15 hours: 1638400 * 2 = 3276800\n\nAfter 16 hours: 3276800 * 2 = 6553600\n\nAfter 17 hours: 6553600 * 2 = 13107200\n\nAfter 18 hours: 13107200 * 2 = 26214400\n\nAfter 19 hours: 26214400 * 2 = 52428800\n\nAfter 20 hours: 52428800 * 2 = 104857600\n\nAfter 21 hours: 104857600 * 2 = 209715200\n\nAfter 22 hours: 209715200 * 2 = 419430400\n\nAfter 23 hours: 419430400 * 2 = 838860800\n\nAfter 24 hours: 838860800 * 2 = 1677721600\n\nYes, that confirms it. 1,677,721,600 bacteria after 24 hours.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 100 \\times 2^{24} \\]\n\n\\[ 2^{24} = 16,777,216 \\]\n\n\\[ P = 100 \\times 16,777,216 = 1,677,721,600 \\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1,677,721,600 bacteria after one day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1677721600} \\]"
