        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: a farmer has chickens and rabbits in his yard. He counted a total of 30 heads and 80 legs. I need to figure out how many chickens and rabbits there are.\n\nFirst, I know that both chickens and rabbits have heads, and that's probably what the 30 heads represent. So, if there are 30 heads, that means there are 30 animals in total because each animal has one head.\n\nNext, I need to consider the legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and rabbits have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 80.\n\nI think I can set up some equations to solve this. Let's define:\n\n- Let C be the number of chickens.\n\n- Let R be the number of rabbits.\n\nFrom the heads, I know that:\n\nC + R = 30\n\nBecause there are 30 animals in total.\n\nFrom the legs, I know that:\n\n2C + 4R = 80\n\nBecause chickens have 2 legs and rabbits have 4 legs, and together they have 80 legs.\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) C + R = 30\n\n2) 2C + 4R = 80\n\nI need to solve for C and R.\n\nOne way to solve this is by substitution. I can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for C:\n\nC = 30 - R\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n2(30 - R) + 4R = 80\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n60 - 2R + 4R = 80\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n60 + 2R = 80\n\nNow, subtract 60 from both sides:\n\n2R = 20\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nR = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 rabbits.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for C:\n\nC = 30 - 10 = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 20 chickens and 10 rabbits.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nIf there are 20 chickens, that's 20 * 2 = 40 legs.\n\nIf there are 10 rabbits, that's 10 * 4 = 40 legs.\n\nTotal legs: 40 + 40 = 80, which matches the given total.\n\nAnd heads: 20 + 10 = 30, which also matches.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used elimination or other methods to solve the system of equations, but substitution worked fine in this case.\n\nIt's interesting how setting up the equations based on the given information allows me to find the solution systematically.\n\nI wonder if there are other ways to approach this problem, maybe without using algebra.\n\nLet's think about it.\n\nSuppose I assume all animals are chickens. Then, with 30 animals, there would be 30 * 2 = 60 legs.\n\nBut actually, there are 80 legs, which is 20 legs more than 60.\n\nSince each rabbit has 2 more legs than a chicken, the difference of 20 legs must be due to the rabbits.\n\nSo, number of rabbits = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nThen, number of chickens = 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nThis matches the previous result.\n\nThat's a quicker way to solve it, without setting up equations.\n\nI like that method because it's more intuitive and requires less algebra.\n\nSo, in summary, there are 20 chickens and 10 rabbits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20 \\text{ chickens and } 10 \\text{ rabbits}} \\]"
