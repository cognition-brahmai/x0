        "content": "So I've got this anagram to solve. It says, \"I am a weakish speller\" and it's supposed to be the name of a famous English playwright and poet. Hmm, let's see. First, I need to rearrange the letters in that phrase to form the name.\n\nOkay, the phrase is \"I am a weakish speller.\" Let's count the letters:\n\nI, a, m, a, space, w, e, a, k, i, s, h, space, s, p, e, l, l, e, r.\n\nWait, spaces don't count in anagrams, right? So, ignoring the spaces, the phrase has: I, a, m, a, w, e, a, k, i, s, h, s, p, e, l, l, e, r.\n\nLet me list all the letters:\n\nI: 3\n\nA: 3\n\nM: 1\n\nW: 1\n\nE: 3\n\nK: 1\n\nI: already counted\n\nS: 2\n\nH: 1\n\nP: 1\n\nL: 2\n\nR: 1\n\nSo, total letters: 3 I's, 3 A's, 1 M, 1 W, 3 E's, 1 K, 2 S's, 1 H, 1 P, 2 L's, 1 R.\n\nNow, I need to form a name of a famous English playwright and poet from these letters.\n\nFirst, I should think about famous English playwrights and poets. Shakespeare comes to mind immediately. Let's see if his name can be formed from these letters.\n\nShakespeare is spelled S-H-A-K-E-S-P-E-A-R-E.\n\nLet's check the letters:\n\nS: 2 (needed 2)\n\nH: 1\n\nA: 3 (needed 3)\n\nK: 1\n\nE: 3 (needed 3)\n\nS: already counted\n\nP: 1\n\nE: already counted\n\nA: already counted\n\nR: 1\n\nE: already counted\n\nSo, all the letters in Shakespeare can be formed from the letters in \"I am a weakish speller.\"\n\nWait, but the anagram should use all the letters, right? Or just form the name from the available letters?\n\nIn some anagrams, you can use only the letters present, but don't have to use them all. But in this case, since it's a famous name, and Shakespeare fits, and the letters match, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other famous English playwrights or poets whose names can be formed from these letters.\n\nLet's consider some alternatives:\n\n1. Christopher Marlowe: C-H-R-I-S-T-O-P-H-E-R - M-A-R-L-O-W-E\n\nLooking at the letters available, I don't have C, O, T, etc., so that doesn't fit.\n\n2. John Milton: J-O-H-N - M-I-L-T-O-N\n\nAgain, I don't have J, O, etc.\n\n3. William Wordsworth: W-I-L-L-I-A-M - W-O-R-D-S-W-O-R-T-H\n\nI don't have D, O, etc.\n\n4. Andrew Marvell: A-N-D-R-E-W - M-A-R-V-E-L-L\n\nI don't have V, etc.\n\nSo, none of these seem to fit the letters available.\n\nTherefore, Shakespeare seems to be the only plausible option.\n\nMoreover, there's a famous anecdote about Shakespeare being a \"weakish speller,\" as his spelling of words was not always consistent and sometimes idiosyncratic.\n\nSo, I think the answer is Shakespeare.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Shakespeare}} \\]"
