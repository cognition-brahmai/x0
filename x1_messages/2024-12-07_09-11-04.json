        "content": "Let's see here. So, we have a group of friends playing a guessing game with candies in a jar. Alice guesses 35, Bob guesses 42, and Carol guesses 50. The actual number is 45. The winner is the one who guessed closest to 45, and if there's a tie, they split the prize.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who guessed closest to 45. To do that, I should probably calculate the difference between each guess and the actual number. Let's start with Alice.\n\nAlice guessed 35. So, the difference between her guess and the actual number is 45 minus 35, which is 10. So, she was off by 10 candies.\n\nNext, Bob guessed 42. The difference between his guess and the actual number is 45 minus 42, which is 3. So, he was off by 3 candies.\n\nThen, Carol guessed 50. The difference between her guess and the actual number is 50 minus 45, which is 5. So, she was off by 5 candies.\n\nNow, comparing the differences: Alice was off by 10, Bob by 3, and Carol by 5. So, Bob has the smallest difference, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, Bob wins the game because his guess was closest to the actual number of candies.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that if two or more people tie, they split the prize. In this case, there is no tie since Bob has the smallest difference. So, Bob wins alone.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nAlice: 45 - 35 = 10\n\nBob: 45 - 42 = 3\n\nCarol: 50 - 45 = 5\n\nYes, Bob's difference is indeed the smallest.\n\nSo, the final answer is Bob wins the game.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Bob wins the game.}} \\]"
