        "content": "The fundamental theorem of calculus connects differential calculus and integral calculus. So, the correct answer is B. Differential and Integral Calculus.\n\nTo elaborate, differential calculus deals with rates of change and slopes of curves, while integral calculus deals with accumulation of quantities and areas under and between curves. The fundamental theorem of calculus establishes the relationship between these two branches by stating that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. This means that if you take a function, differentiate it, and then integrate the result, you get back to the original function (up to a constant). Similarly, if you integrate a function and then differentiate the result, you obtain the original function.\n\nThis theorem is crucial because it provides a way to compute integrals by finding antiderivatives, which are functions whose derivatives are the original functions being integrated. This connection has far-reaching implications and is a cornerstone of calculus, making it a fundamental tool in mathematics and its applications in science, engineering, and economics.\n\nSo, to summarize, the fundamental theorem of calculus bridges the gap between differential and integral calculus, showing that these two seemingly distinct areas of mathematics are intimately connected and, in a sense, inverses of each other.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
