        "content": "Let's break this down. So, the factory produces 200 widgets per hour. And every 10 minutes, one defective widget is produced. We need to find out how many non-defective widgets are produced in 5 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of widgets produced in 5 hours. Since the factory produces 200 widgets per hour, in 5 hours it would produce:\n\n200 widgets/hour * 5 hours = 1000 widgets\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these are defective. It says that a defective widget is produced every 10 minutes.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so in one hour, the number of defective widgets would be:\n\n60 minutes/hour / 10 minutes/defective widget = 6 defective widgets/hour\n\nOver 5 hours, the total number of defective widgets would be:\n\n6 defective widgets/hour * 5 hours = 30 defective widgets\n\nNow, to find the number of non-defective widgets, I subtract the defective ones from the total widgets produced:\n\n1000 widgets - 30 defective widgets = 970 non-defective widgets\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of rates. The production rate is 200 widgets per hour, and the defective rate is one every 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, convert the defective rate to per hour.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, and a defective widget is produced every 10 minutes, the number of defective widgets per hour is:\n\n60 / 10 = 6 defective widgets per hour\n\nSo, the non-defective production rate per hour would be:\n\n200 widgets/hour - 6 defective widgets/hour = 194 non-defective widgets/hour\n\nOver 5 hours, the total non-defective widgets would be:\n\n194 non-defective widgets/hour * 5 hours = 970 non-defective widgets\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the probability of a widget being non-defective.\n\nIf one out of every 10 minutes' production is defective, and widgets are produced at a rate of 200 per hour, I can find the rate of defective widgets.\n\nBut I think I've already established that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the time between defective widgets.\n\nEvery 10 minutes, one defective widget is produced.\n\nIn 5 hours, which is 300 minutes, the number of defective widgets would be:\n\n300 minutes / 10 minutes/defective widget = 30 defective widgets\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total production:\n\n1000 total widgets - 30 defective widgets = 970 non-defective widgets\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the defective widget is part of the 200 produced per hour or in addition to it.\n\nThe way the question is phrased, \"a defective widget is produced every 10 minutes,\" I think it's part of the production rate.\n\nSo, the total production is 200 widgets per hour, including both defective and non-defective.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-defective widgets would be the total production minus the defective ones.\n\nI think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the defective widget is in addition to the 200, then the total production would be higher, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nThe question says \"a defective widget is produced every 10 minutes,\" which seems like it's included in the total production rate.\n\nSo, I'll stick with my original answer of 970 non-defective widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{970} \\]"
