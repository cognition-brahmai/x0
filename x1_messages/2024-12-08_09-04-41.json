The fuel consumption rates are 5 gallons per mile for regional jets, 8 gallons per mile for medium-sized planes, and 12 gallons per mile for long-haul aircraft. The airline flies a total of 10,000 miles daily, with a breakdown of 40% regional jets, 35% medium-sized planes, and 25% long-haul aircraft. Calculate the total daily fuel consumption for each type of aircraft and determine which one contributes the most to overall fuel expenses."

        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The airline operates three types of aircraft: small regional jets, medium-sized planes, and large long-haul aircraft. Each has different fuel consumption rates: 5 gallons per mile for regional jets, 8 gallons per mile for medium-sized planes, and 12 gallons per mile for long-haul aircraft. The total daily mileage is 10,000 miles, divided among the aircraft types as follows: 40% regional jets, 35% medium-sized planes, and 25% long-haul aircraft. Our goal is to calculate the total daily fuel consumption for each type and determine which one contributes the most to overall fuel expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many miles each type of aircraft flies daily.\n\nStarting with regional jets:\n\nTotal miles: 10,000 miles\n\nPercentage for regional jets: 40%\n\nMiles flown by regional jets: 40% of 10,000 miles\n\nTo calculate that: (40/100) * 10,000 = 4,000 miles\n\nNext, medium-sized planes:\n\nPercentage: 35%\n\nMiles flown: 35% of 10,000 miles\n\n(35/100) * 10,000 = 3,500 miles\n\nThen, long-haul aircraft:\n\nPercentage: 25%\n\nMiles flown: 25% of 10,000 miles\n\n(25/100) * 10,000 = 2,500 miles\n\nNow, I need to calculate the fuel consumption for each type based on their miles flown and their respective fuel consumption rates.\n\nStarting with regional jets:\n\nMiles flown: 4,000 miles\n\nFuel consumption rate: 5 gallons per mile\n\nTotal fuel consumption: 4,000 miles * 5 gallons/mile = 20,000 gallons\n\nNext, medium-sized planes:\n\nMiles flown: 3,500 miles\n\nFuel consumption rate: 8 gallons per mile\n\nTotal fuel consumption: 3,500 miles * 8 gallons/mile = 28,000 gallons\n\nThen, long-haul aircraft:\n\nMiles flown: 2,500 miles\n\nFuel consumption rate: 12 gallons per mile\n\nTotal fuel consumption: 2,500 miles * 12 gallons/mile = 30,000 gallons\n\nNow, let's summarize the total daily fuel consumption for each type:\n\n- Regional jets: 20,000 gallons\n\n- Medium-sized planes: 28,000 gallons\n\n- Long-haul aircraft: 30,000 gallons\n\nTo determine which one contributes the most to overall fuel expenses, we need to look at which type consumes the most fuel. From the calculations above, the long-haul aircraft consume the most fuel daily, with 30,000 gallons, compared to medium-sized planes at 28,000 gallons and regional jets at 20,000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the long-haul aircraft contribute the most to overall fuel expenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Long-haul aircraft contribute the most to overall fuel expenses.}} \\]"
