        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces widgets at a rate of 500 per hour. They have two shifts, each lasting 8 hours. So, first, I need to calculate how many widgets they produce in a normal day.\n\nEach shift is 8 hours long, and they have two shifts, so that's 16 hours in total for the day. At 500 widgets per hour, the total production in a normal day would be:\n\n500 widgets/hour * 16 hours = 8,000 widgets.\n\nBut they need to produce 15,000 widgets in one day. So, the shortfall is:\n\n15,000 widgets - 8,000 widgets = 7,000 widgets.\n\nNow, they need to produce these additional 7,000 widgets. Since they produce at a rate of 500 widgets per hour, the number of additional hours required would be:\n\n7,000 widgets / 500 widgets/hour = 14 hours.\n\nSo, they need to operate an additional 14 hours beyond their normal schedule to meet the target of 15,000 widgets in one day.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. In a normal day, they operate for 16 hours and produce 8,000 widgets. Adding 14 more hours would bring the total operating time to 30 hours, and the total production would be:\n\n500 widgets/hour * 30 hours = 15,000 widgets.\n\nYes, that matches the required production. So, the answer is they need to operate an additional 14 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
