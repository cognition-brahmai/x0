        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers and returns an object with the minimum, maximum, average, and median values. Also, I need to handle errors for non-integer inputs and empty arrays. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the function accepts an array as its argument. I should check if the input is indeed an array and that it's not empty. If it's not an array or is empty, I should probably throw an error or handle it in some way.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that all elements in the array are integers. JavaScript has a way to check if a value is an integer using the Number.isInteger() method. I should iterate through the array and verify each element. If I find any non-integer, I should handle that appropriately, maybe by throwing an error or skipping that value.\n\nOnce I have a valid array of integers, I can proceed to calculate the required statistics:\n\n1. **Minimum value**: I can use the Math.min() function on the array, but I need to spread the array since Math.min() takes individual arguments.\n\n2. **Maximum value**: Similarly, Math.max() can be used with the spread operator.\n\n3. **Average value**: I need to sum all the integers and divide by the number of elements. I can use the reduce() method to sum the array.\n\n4. **Median value**: This is a bit trickier. I need to sort the array first and then find the middle value. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nLet me think about the steps for the median:\n\n- Sort the array in ascending order.\n\n- If the array length is odd, the median is the middle element.\n\n- If the array length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\nI should also consider if the array has only one element; in that case, the median would be that single element.\n\nNow, for error handling:\n\n- If the input is not an array, throw an error.\n\n- If the array is empty, maybe return a specific message or throw an error.\n\n- If the array contains non-integer values, decide whether to throw an error or exclude those values from calculations.\n\nI think for the sake of robustness, I'll choose to throw an error if any non-integer is found in the array. That way, the function expects clean data, and the caller knows to preprocess the data if necessary.\n\nAlternatively, I could make the function more forgiving and automatically skip non-integer values, but that might lead to unexpected results if the caller isn't aware of it.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the function:\n\n```\n\nfunction arrayStats(arr) {\n\n if (!Array.isArray(arr)) {\n\n throw new Error('Input must be an array.');\n\n }\n\n if (arr.length === 0) {\n\n throw new Error('Array is empty.');\n\n }\n\n if (!arr.every(Number.isInteger)) {\n\n throw new Error('All elements must be integers.');\n\n }\n\n const sorted = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n const min = sorted[0];\n\n const max = sorted[sorted.length - 1];\n\n const sum = sorted.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);\n\n const avg = sum / sorted.length;\n\n let median;\n\n if (sorted.length % 2 === 0) {\n\n const mid1 = sorted[sorted.length / 2 - 1];\n\n const mid2 = sorted[sorted.length / 2];\n\n median = (mid1 + mid2) / 2;\n\n } else {\n\n median = sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length / 2)];\n\n }\n\n return {\n\n min: min,\n\n max: max,\n\n avg: avg,\n\n median: median\n\n };\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. Now, I need to think about edge cases:\n\n- Array with one element.\n\n- Array with two elements.\n\n- Array with odd and even numbers of elements.\n\n- Array with negative integers.\n\n- Array with all identical integers.\n\nI should test each of these scenarios to ensure the function works correctly.\n\nLet me consider an array with one element, say [5]. The min, max, avg, and median should all be 5.\n\nFor an array with two elements, like [3, 7], the min should be 3, max be 7, avg be 5, and median be 5.\n\nFor an array with odd length, like [1, 3, 5], the median should be 3.\n\nFor even length, like [1, 2, 3, 4], the median should be 2.5.\n\nFor negative integers, like [-1, -3, -2], the min should be -3, max be -1, avg be -2, and median be -2.\n\nFor identical integers, like [4, 4, 4, 4], all stats should be 4.\n\nNow, let's think about non-integer values. If the array contains a non-integer, like [1, 2, '3', 4], the function should throw an error.\n\nAlso, if the input is not an array, say a string or a number, it should throw an error.\n\nIf the array is empty, it should throw an error.\n\nI need to make sure that the function handles these cases gracefully.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the sort function for numbers should use the comparator (a, b) => a - b to ensure numerical sorting instead of lexicographical.\n\nI should also consider if the array contains undefined or null values, but since I'm checking with Number.isInteger(), those would be caught as non-integers.\n\nWait, Number.isInteger() checks if the value is an integer number. So, undefined, null, strings, etc., would not pass this check.\n\nBut, just to be safe, I can add explicit checks for these cases.\n\nMaybe I can iterate through the array and ensure each element is a number and an integer.\n\nLet me think about floating-point numbers. If the array contains floats, like [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], Number.isInteger() should return false because they are floats, not integers. So, the function would throw an error, which is correct.\n\nHowever, if the floats are whole numbers, like [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], technically they are integers, but JavaScript considers them as floats. To handle this, I might need to check if the number is integer-valued, even if it's represented as a float.\n\nIn JavaScript, Number.isInteger(1.0) returns false, so I need a way to check if a number is a whole number, regardless of being integer or float.\n\nI can use something like Number.isInteger(value) || (typeof value === 'number' && value % 1 === 0)\n\nThis way, both 1 and 1.0 would be considered integers.\n\nBut, to keep it strict, maybe I should only accept values that are actually integers, i.e., use Number.isInteger().\n\nThe problem with accepting 1.0 as an integer is that it might not be the intended behavior, and it's better to enforce that the input is strictly integers.\n\nSo, I'll stick with Number.isInteger().\n\nNow, let's think about the sorting. I'll need to sort the array in ascending order to find the median.\n\nI should create a copy of the array before sorting, to avoid modifying the original array.\n\nIn JavaScript, arr.slice() creates a shallow copy, which is sufficient for our purposes.\n\nNow, for the average, I need to handle the case where the sum of integers might be a large number, but in JavaScript, numbers are floating-point, and for very large integers, there might be precision issues.\n\nHowever, for the scope of this function, I'll assume that the integers are within a range that JavaScript can handle accurately.\n\nAlternatively, if high precision is needed, I could use the BigInt type, but that would complicate things, and since the input is integers, I'll proceed with regular numbers.\n\nLet me also consider how to return the average. Should it be a floating-point number even if the average is an integer?\n\nFor example, for [1, 2, 3], the average is 2, which is an integer, but for [1, 2, 3, 4], it's 2.5.\n\nIn JavaScript, the division operation will return a float if the result is not an integer, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nI can just return the division result as is.\n\nNow, let's think about the median. It should always be a number, either an integer or a float, depending on the values.\n\nIn the case where the median is an integer, it should return an integer, and if it's between two numbers, it should return a float.\n\nFor example, in [1, 2, 3, 4], the median is 2.5, which is a float.\n\nIn [1, 2, 3], the median is 2, which is an integer.\n\nJavaScript will handle this appropriately, as long as I perform the division correctly.\n\nI need to make sure that when calculating the median for even-length arrays, I average the two middle numbers correctly.\n\nLet me write some test cases:\n\n1. arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n- min: 1\n\n- max: 4\n\n- avg: 2.5\n\n- median: 2.5\n\n2. arr = [1, 2, 3]\n\n- min: 1\n\n- max: 3\n\n- avg: 2\n\n- median: 2\n\n3. arr = [5]\n\n- min: 5\n\n- max: 5\n\n- avg: 5\n\n- median: 5\n\n4. arr = [-1, -3, -2]\n\n- min: -3\n\n- max: -1\n\n- avg: -2\n\n- median: -2\n\n5. arr = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n\n- Should throw an error, as these are floats, not integers.\n\n6. arr = ['1', '2', '3']\n\n- Should throw an error, as these are strings.\n\n7. arr = [1, 2, '3', 4]\n\n- Should throw an error due to the string '3'.\n\n8. arr = []\n\n- Should throw an error for empty array.\n\n9. arr = 123\n\n- Should throw an error for non-array input.\n\n10. arr = undefined\n\n- Should throw an error for non-array input.\n\nI should also consider if the array contains boolean values, as they can be coerced to numbers in JavaScript.\n\nFor example, arr = [1, true, 3], where true is coerced to 1.\n\nTo prevent this, I should ensure that only integers are allowed, and booleans are not.\n\nSince Number.isInteger(true) returns false, it should be caught by the error handling.\n\nSimilarly, null and undefined should be caught.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation in code.\n\nI'll start by checking if the input is an array using Array.isArray().\n\nIf not, throw an error.\n\nThen, check if the array is empty. If it is, throw an error.\n\nNext, iterate through the array and check if each element is an integer using Number.isInteger().\n\nIf any element is not an integer, throw an error.\n\nThen, sort the array in ascending order using arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b).\n\nCalculate min and max using sorted[0] and sorted[sorted.length - 1].\n\nCalculate sum using sorted.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0).\n\nCalculate avg by dividing sum by the length of the array.\n\nCalculate median:\n\n- If the length is odd, median is sorted[Math.floor(length / 2)].\n\n- If even, median is the average of sorted[length / 2 - 1] and sorted[length / 2].\n\nFinally, return an object with min, max, avg, and median properties.\n\nI should also consider rounding the avg and median to a certain number of decimal places, but for now, I'll keep them as is.\n\nIf needed, I can add rounding in the function.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll return the exact values.\n\nLet me also think about performance.\n\nSince the function is likely to be used with small to moderately sized arrays, performance shouldn't be a big issue.\n\nHowever, sorting has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is acceptable for this purpose.\n\nIf the arrays are extremely large, there might be performance considerations, but for now, I'll assume that the arrays are manageable.\n\nI should also consider if there are built-in functions in JavaScript that can help with these calculations.\n\nFor example, Math.min.apply() can be used to find the minimum value, but it's deprecated in strict mode and not recommended for large arrays due to potential stack overflows.\n\nSimilarly, Math.max.apply() has the same issues.\n\nUsing the spread operator with Math.min and Math.max is better, but still, for consistency, I'll use the sorted array to get min and max.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the function.\n\nI can write a single function that does all these calculations, or I can break them down into smaller helper functions.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll keep it in a single function.\n\nHowever, if I were to make it more modular, I could have separate functions for min, max, avg, and median, each taking the sorted array as an argument.\n\nBut for this task, a single function should suffice.\n\nI should also consider adding comments to the code for clarity.\n\nNow, let me write a draft of the function and test it with some of the cases I thought about.\n\nHere's a draft:\n\n```\n\nfunction arrayStats(arr) {\n\n if (!Array.isArray(arr)) {\n\n throw new Error('Input must be an array.');\n\n }\n\n if (arr.length === 0) {\n\n throw new Error('Array is empty.');\n\n }\n\n if (!arr.every(Number.isInteger)) {\n\n throw new Error('All elements must be integers.');\n\n }\n\n const sorted = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\n const min = sorted[0];\n\n const max = sorted[sorted.length - 1];\n\n const sum = sorted.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);\n\n const avg = sum / sorted.length;\n\n let median;\n\n if (sorted.length % 2 === 0) {\n\n const mid1 = sorted[sorted.length / 2 - 1];\n\n const mid2 = sorted[sorted.length / 2];\n\n median = (mid1 + mid2) / 2;\n\n } else {\n\n median = sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length / 2)];\n\n }\n\n return {\n\n min: min,\n\n max: max,\n\n avg: avg,\n\n median: median\n\n };\n\n}\n\n```\n\nNow, test it with arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n\n- sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n- min: 1\n\n- max: 4\n\n- sum: 10\n\n- avg: 2.5\n\n- median: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTest with arr = [1, 2, 3]:\n\n- sorted: [1, 2, 3]\n\n- min: 1\n\n- max: 3\n\n- sum: 6\n\n- avg: 2\n\n- median: 2\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest with arr = [5]:\n\n- sorted: [5]\n\n- min: 5\n\n- max: 5\n\n- sum: 5\n\n- avg: 5\n\n- median: 5\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest with arr = [-1, -3, -2]:\n\n- sorted: [-3, -2, -1]\n\n- min: -3\n\n- max: -1\n\n- sum: -6\n\n- avg: -2\n\n- median: -2\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest with arr = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]:\n\n- Number.isInteger(1.0) === false\n\n- Should throw an error\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest with arr = ['1', '2', '3']:\n\n- Number.isInteger('1') === false\n\n- Should throw an error\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest with arr = [1, 2, '3', 4]:\n\n- Number.isInteger('3') === false\n\n- Should throw an error\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest with arr = []:\n\n- arr.length === 0\n\n- Should throw an error\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest with arr = 123:\n\n- !Array.isArray(123) === true\n\n- Should throw an error\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest with arr = undefined:\n\n- !Array.isArray(undefined) === true\n\n- Should throw an error\n\nCorrect.\n\nSeems like the function is working as expected with these test cases.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the array contains NaN or Infinity.\n\nFor example, arr = [1, 2, NaN, 4]\n\n- Number.isInteger(NaN) === false\n\n- Should throw an error\n\nSimilarly, arr = [1, 2, Infinity, 4]\n\n- Number.isInteger(Infinity) === false\n\n- Should throw an error\n\nThis is good, as it ensures only valid integers are processed.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to make the function more efficient or if there's any way to optimize it.\n\nOne optimization could be to calculate min, max, sum in a single pass, but since the array needs to be sorted for median, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sort operation.\n\nSo, trying to optimize min, max, and sum might not have a significant impact.\n\nHowever, for the sake of efficiency, I can iterate through the array once and keep track of the current min, max, and sum.\n\nThen, after sorting, calculate the median.\n\nBut in JavaScript, the sort function is highly optimized, so it's probably not worth the extra complexity.\n\nI'll keep it simple for now.\n\nAnother consideration is that sorting an array with duplicate values should not affect the calculations.\n\nFor example, arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\n- sorted: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\n- min: 1\n\n- max: 3\n\n- sum: 8\n\n- avg: 2\n\n- median: (2 + 2)/2 = 2\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAlso, arr = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]\n\n- sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n- min: 1\n\n- max: 5\n\n- sum: 15\n\n- avg: 3\n\n- median: 3\n\nCorrect.\n\nI think the function is robust and handles various cases correctly.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the function is properly formatted and follows best practices.\n\nI can add JSDoc comments to describe the function, its parameters, and return value.\n\nI can also consider making the function more flexible, perhaps by allowing options to handle non-integer values in a different way, but for this task, sticking to the requirements is sufficient.\n\nFinally, I should test the function in a JavaScript environment to ensure there are no syntax errors or runtime issues.\n\nAssuming I've done that and confirmed it works, I can consider the task complete.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers and returns an object containing the minimum value, maximum value, average value, and median value of the array. We must also handle errors for non-integer inputs and empty arrays.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - Check if the input is an array using `Array.isArray()`.\n   - Check if the array is empty.\n   - Ensure all elements in the array are integers using `Number.isInteger()`.\n\n2. **Calculations**:\n   - **Minimum and Maximum**: After sorting the array, the first and last elements will be the minimum and maximum values, respectively.\n   - **Average**: Calculate the sum of the array elements using `reduce()` and divide by the number of elements.\n   - **Median**: \n     - If the array length is odd, the median is the middle element.\n     - If the array length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - Throw an error if the input is not an array.\n   - Throw an error if the array is empty.\n   - Throw an error if any element in the array is not an integer.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Computes min, max, average, and median of an array of integers.\n *\n * @param {number[]} arr - The array of integers.\n * @returns {{min: number, max: number, avg: number, median: number}} An object containing the computed statistics.\n * @throws {Error} If input is not an array, is empty, or contains non-integer values.\n */\nfunction arrayStats(arr) {\n    if (!Array.isArray(arr)) {\n        throw new Error('Input must be an array.');\n    }\n    if (arr.length === 0) {\n        throw new Error('Array is empty.');\n    }\n    if (!arr.every(Number.isInteger)) {\n        throw new Error('All elements must be integers.');\n    }\n\n    const sorted = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    const min = sorted[0];\n    const max = sorted[sorted.length - 1];\n    const sum = sorted.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);\n    const avg = sum / sorted.length;\n\n    let median;\n    if (sorted.length % 2 === 0) {\n        const mid1 = sorted[sorted.length / 2 - 1];\n        const mid2 = sorted[sorted.length / 2];\n        median = (mid1 + mid2) / 2;\n    } else {\n        median = sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length / 2)];\n    }\n\n    return {\n        min: min,\n        max: max,\n        avg: avg,\n        median: median\n    };\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Validation**: Ensures the input is a non-empty array of integers.\n- **Sorting**: Creates a sorted copy of the array to easily find min, max, and median.\n- **Min and Max**: Directly accessed from the sorted array.\n- **Average**: Calculated by summing the array elements and dividing by the number of elements.\n- **Median**: Computed based on the array's length being even or odd.\n- **Error Handling**: Throws informative errors for invalid inputs."
