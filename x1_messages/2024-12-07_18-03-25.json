The dayside is a scorching desert, while the nightside is covered in icy tundras. A narrow band of habitable temperate zones exists along the terminator line, where day meets night.\n\n**Inhabitants:** The planet is home to the indigenous Luminari, a bioluminescent humanoid species that can regulate their body temperature to adapt to extreme climates. They have established sustainable cities in the temperate regions, harnessing geothermal energy from the planet's volcanic fissures.\n\n**Anomaly:** Recently, a mysterious energy signature has been detected emanating from the heart of the dayside desert. It appears to be a massive, pulsating structure that defies known physics, emitting waves of energy that disrupt local ecosystems and technological devices.\n\n**Conflict:** As the energy pulses grow stronger, they begin to cause severe weather disturbances and melt the polar ice caps on the nightside, threatening to flood the Luminari cities. Additionally, the anomaly seems to be attracting hostile extraterrestrial entities, leading to increased aggression and attacks on the Luminari settlements. The Luminari must find a way to stabilize or neutralize the anomaly before their world is consumed by chaos."
