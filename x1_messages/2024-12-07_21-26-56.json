        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of employees: full-time and part-time. Full-time employees work 40 hours per week, and part-time employees work 20 hours per week. There are 30 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. We need to find out the total number of hours worked by all employees in one month.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many hours each type of employee works in a month. But wait, the problem gives us weekly hours. So, I should probably find out how many weeks are in a month to convert this to monthly hours.\n\nI know that a month typically has about 4 weeks. Some months have a little more, but to keep it simple, I'll assume there are 4 weeks in a month.\n\nSo, for full-time employees:\n\nHours per week: 40\n\nNumber of weeks in a month: 4\n\nTherefore, hours per month per full-time employee: 40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 hours/month\n\nSimilarly, for part-time employees:\n\nHours per week: 20\n\nNumber of weeks in a month: 4\n\nTherefore, hours per month per part-time employee: 20 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 80 hours/month\n\nNow, we have 30 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees.\n\nSo, total hours by full-time employees in a month:\n\n30 employees * 160 hours/month = 4800 hours/month\n\nTotal hours by part-time employees in a month:\n\n10 employees * 80 hours/month = 800 hours/month\n\nNow, to find the total hours worked by all employees in one month, we add these two amounts together:\n\n4800 hours/month + 800 hours/month = 5600 hours/month\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check my assumptions.\n\nFirst, assuming 4 weeks per month might not be entirely accurate, as most months have around 4.33 weeks (since 52 weeks in a year divided by 12 months is approximately 4.33 weeks per month). If I use that, my calculation might be more precise.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor full-time employees:\n\n40 hours/week * 4.33 weeks/month \u2248 173.2 hours/month\n\nFor part-time employees:\n\n20 hours/week * 4.33 weeks/month \u2248 86.6 hours/month\n\nNow, total hours by full-time employees:\n\n30 * 173.2 \u2248 5196 hours/month\n\nTotal hours by part-time employees:\n\n10 * 86.6 \u2248 866 hours/month\n\nTotal hours:\n\n5196 + 866 = 6062 hours/month\n\nThat's quite a bit different from my initial calculation of 5600 hours. So, which one should I go with?\n\nWell, using 4.33 weeks per month is more accurate, but the problem didn't specify, so maybe 4 weeks is acceptable for estimation purposes.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate based on hours per year and then divide by 12 to get monthly hours, but that might be overkill.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year.\n\nFull-time: 40 hours/week * 52 weeks = 2080 hours/year\n\nPart-time: 20 hours/week * 52 weeks = 1040 hours/year\n\nTotal full-time hours per year: 30 * 2080 = 62,400 hours/year\n\nTotal part-time hours per year: 10 * 1040 = 10,400 hours/year\n\nTotal hours per year: 62,400 + 10,400 = 72,800 hours/year\n\nNow, to find monthly hours, divide by 12:\n\n72,800 hours/year \u00f7 12 months/year \u2248 6,066.67 hours/month\n\nThis is very close to my earlier calculation using 4.33 weeks per month (6062 hours), so that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours worked by all employees in one month is approximately 6,067 hours.\n\nBut to be precise, considering that not all months have exactly the same number of days or weeks, and accounting for things like holidays and vacation time, the actual hours might vary.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, I think 6,067 hours is a reasonable estimate for the total monthly hours worked by all employees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6067} \\]"
