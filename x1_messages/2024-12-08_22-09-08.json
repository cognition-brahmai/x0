        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that extracts email addresses from a text file using regular expressions and then saves those emails into a new text file. Sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure I cover all the bases here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what a regular expression (regex) is and how it can help me find email addresses in a text. Regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, and it's particularly useful for matching patterns in strings, like identifying email addresses.\n\nSo, what does a typical email address look like? It usually has a username part, followed by the \"@\" symbol, and then the domain name, which includes the domain and the top-level domain (TLD). For example, \"example@example.com\".\n\nBut emails can be more complex than that. Users can have dots, hyphens, and other characters in their usernames. Domains can have subdomains, and there are many possible TLDs, like .com, .org, .net, and country-specific ones like .in or .uk.\n\nGiven that, I need to create a regex pattern that can capture a wide variety of valid email formats. I don't want to make it too permissive, allowing invalid emails, but nor do I want it to be too restrictive and miss valid ones.\n\nI recall that in regex, certain characters have special meanings, like the dot (.), which matches any character, or the asterisk (*), which matches zero or more of the preceding element. So, I need to be careful with these meta-characters, especially since they appear in email addresses themselves.\n\nLet me think about the structure:\n\n1. **Username Part:**\n\n- Typically consists of letters, numbers, dots (.), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).\n\n- May start with a letter or a number, but I've seen emails starting with dots or numbers as well.\n\n- For simplicity, I'll assume it can start with any of the allowed characters.\n\n2. **Domain Name:**\n\n- Consists of letters, numbers, hyphens, and dots.\n\n- Subdomains are possible, like \"sub.domain.com\".\n\n- The top-level domain can be two or more letters, like .com, .org, .co.uk, etc.\n\n3. **Special Cases:**\n\n- Emails with numbers in the username or domain.\n\n- Emails with multiple subdomains.\n\n- Emails with country-code TLDs.\n\n- Emails with hyphens in the username or domain.\n\nGiven these considerations, I need to craft a regex pattern that can handle these variations.\n\nI remember that in Python, the `re` module is used for regex operations. So, I'll need to import that.\n\nHere's a basic plan for the script:\n\n1. **Read the input text file:**\n\n- Open the file in read mode.\n\n- Read the content into a string.\n\n2. **Define the regex pattern for email addresses:**\n\n- Create a pattern that matches the structure of email addresses.\n\n3. **Find all occurrences of the pattern:**\n\n- Use `re.findall()` to get a list of all matching email addresses.\n\n4. **Write the extracted emails to a new text file:**\n\n- Open a new file in write mode.\n\n- Write each email address on a new line.\n\n5. **Handle any potential errors:**\n\n- Ensure the input file exists.\n\n- Handle cases where no emails are found.\n\n- Close files properly.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the regex pattern. A common regex pattern for emails is:\n\n```regex\n[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+(\\.[\\w]+)+\n```\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- `[\\w\\.-]+` matches one or more word characters, dots, or hyphens for the username part.\n\n- `@` matches the at symbol.\n\n- `[\\w\\.-]+` matches one or more word characters, dots, or hyphens for the domain name.\n\n- `(\\.[\\w]+)+` matches one or more groups of a dot followed by one or more word characters for the TLD.\n\nThis seems okay, but I've seen more comprehensive patterns that handle more edge cases. For example, some emails might have username parts enclosed in quotes, which is allowed by the RFC standards for emails. However, for simplicity, I'll stick with a somewhat less permissive pattern that still covers most common cases.\n\nI should also consider avoiding duplicate emails. So, perhaps I can store the emails in a set to ensure uniqueness.\n\nAnother thing to consider is case sensitivity. Email addresses are case-insensitive, so \"Example@Example.com\" is the same as \"example@example.com\". To handle this, I can convert all emails to lowercase before storing them.\n\nWait, actually, according to RFC standards, the local part (before the @) is case-sensitive, while the domain part is case-insensitive. But in practice, many email systems ignore case in the local part as well. To keep it simple, I'll make the entire email lowercase.\n\nBut to be more accurate, I should only lowercase the domain part. Let me think about how to do that.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's too complicated for this script. I'll go with making the entire email lowercase to avoid duplicates due to case differences.\n\nNow, regarding the input and output files:\n\n- I need to specify the input file name. For now, I'll hardcode it, but later I can make it more flexible by taking it as a command-line argument.\n\n- Similarly, the output file name can be hardcoded, but command-line arguments would be better.\n\n- I should ensure that the script creates the output file in the same directory unless specified otherwise.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the script:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef main():\n    # Define input and output file names\n    input_filename = 'input.txt'\n    output_filename = 'emails.txt'\n    \n    # Read the input file\n    with open(input_filename, 'r') as file:\n        text = file.read()\n    \n    # Define the regex pattern for emails\n    pattern = r'[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+'\n    \n    # Find all emails\n    emails = re.findall(pattern, text)\n    \n    # Convert to lowercase to avoid duplicates\n    emails = [email.lower() for email in emails]\n    \n    # Remove duplicates\n    unique_emails = list(set(emails))\n    \n    # Write to output file\n    with open(output_filename, 'w') as file:\n        for email in unique_emails:\n            file.write(email + '\\n')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nThis is a basic version. I need to test it with some sample text to see if it captures all emails correctly.\n\nLet me think about potential edge cases:\n\n- Emails with numbers: \"user123@example.com\"\n\n- Emails with hyphens: \"user-name@example.com\"\n\n- Emails with multiple dots: \"user.name.example@example.com\"\n\n- Emails with country-code TLDs: \"example@example.co.uk\"\n\n- Emails with special characters: \"user.name+tag@example.com\" (some email systems allow tags after the username)\n\n- Emails enclosed in angle brackets: \"<example@example.com>\"\n\n- Emails with comments: \"user/*comment*/@example.com\" (though this is less common and more complicated to handle)\n\nFor now, I'll focus on the most common formats and see if the pattern can be improved later.\n\nLet me test the pattern `r'[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+'` with some examples.\n\nExample 1: \"user.name@example.com\" -> Should match.\n\nExample 2: \"user-name@example.co.uk\" -> Should match.\n\nExample 3: \"user_name@example.com\" -> Should match.\n\nExample 4: \"user_name@sub.domain.com\" -> Should match.\n\nExample 5: \"user.name+tag@example.com\" -> Should match, but the \"+tag\" might be considered part of the username.\n\nExample 6: \"user-name@example.com\" -> Should match.\n\nExample 7: \"user@example.com\" -> Should match.\n\nExample 8: \"user@domain.com\" -> Should match.\n\nExample 9: \"user@domain.co.in\" -> Should match.\n\nExample 10: \"user@domain\" -> Should not match (no TLD).\n\nWait, according to the pattern `r'[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+'`, \"user@domain\" should not match because there's no dot before the TLD. Good.\n\nBut what about \"user@domain.com.\" with a trailing dot? Is that valid?\n\nAccording to DNS, domain names can end with a trailing dot, representing the root domain. So, \"user@domain.com.\" is technically valid.\n\nMy current pattern won't match it because it expects a dot followed by one or more word characters. To handle trailing dots, I might need to make the dot and TLD optional or handle it differently.\n\nBut for now, I'll leave it as is, assuming that most emails don't have trailing dots.\n\nAnother consideration is emails with IP addresses in the domain part, like \"user@192.168.1.1\". Are such emails valid? Technically, yes, but I doubt the current pattern would match them because it expects word characters in the domain.\n\nGiven that, I might want to make the domain part more flexible, allowing for IP addresses as well. But that complicates the pattern significantly.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll stick with matching domain names consisting of word characters and dots.\n\nWhat about Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), which can include non-Latin characters? My pattern uses `\\w`, which includes underscores and alphanumeric characters but not accented letters or characters from other alphabets.\n\nAgain, for simplicity, I'll assume that the text contains only ASCII emails.\n\nNow, about the username part. I allowed dots, hyphens, and underscores. But are there other allowed characters?\n\nAccording to RFC standards, the local part can include letters, digits, and the special characters: ! # $ % & ' * + - / = ? ^ _ ` { | } ~, as well as dots, but not consecutively.\n\nSo, my current pattern might miss some valid emails that include these special characters.\n\nTo make the pattern more inclusive, I could modify the username part to include these characters.\n\nSomething like: `[a-zA-Z0-9!#\\$%&'\\*\\+\\-/=\\?^_\\`{\\|\\}~]+` plus dots, hyphens, and underscores.\n\nBut dots in the local part have special meaning (they are used as word separators), but for simplicity, I'll keep it as is.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the local part can be enclosed in quotes, allowing for spaces and other characters. But again, that complicates the pattern.\n\nFor now, I'll keep the pattern relatively simple.\n\nLet me see if I can find a standard regex pattern for emails that is widely accepted.\n\nAfter a quick search, I found that a comprehensive regex pattern for emails is quite long and complicated, like this one:\n\n```regex\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\nThis pattern seems more robust:\n\n- `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` matches the local part with allowed characters.\n\n- `@` matches the at symbol.\n\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches the domain name.\n\n- `\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$` matches the dot followed by the TLD, which must be at least two letters long.\n\nThis seems better than my initial pattern. I should use this instead.\n\nLet me test this pattern with some examples.\n\nExample 1: \"user.name@example.com\" -> Matches.\n\nExample 2: \"user_name@example.com\" -> Matches.\n\nExample 3: \"user-name@example.com\" -> Does not match because hyphens are not allowed in the local part according to this pattern.\n\nWait, hyphens are allowed in the domain part but not in the local part in this pattern.\n\nBut according to RFC, hyphens are allowed in the local part.\n\nSo, perhaps I should include hyphens in the local part as well.\n\nModified pattern:\n\n```regex\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\nNow, hyphens are allowed in both local and domain parts.\n\nBetter.\n\nAnother consideration: the local part can have quotes to include special characters, but that's getting too complicated for this script.\n\nI'll stick with the modified pattern.\n\nNow, in the script, I need to use `re.findall()` to find all occurrences of this pattern in the text.\n\nBut `findall()` will return all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, as a list of strings.\n\nGiven that email addresses can be part of larger strings, I need to make sure that the pattern matches whole emails and not parts of larger strings.\n\nTo do that, I can use word boundaries or lookarounds, but the caret (^) and dollar ($) signs in the pattern ensure that it matches the entire email from start to end.\n\nWait, in the pattern I found, there are ^ and $, which match the start and end of the string, respectively.\n\nBut in `findall()`, the pattern is applied to the entire string, and ^ and $ will match the start and end of each line if the MULTILINE flag is used.\n\nI need to think about this.\n\nIf I use `re.findall(pattern, text, re.MULTILINE)`, the ^ and $ will match the start and end of each line.\n\nBut email addresses can span multiple lines, especially if the text is formatted differently.\n\nTo handle multi-line text, I should perhaps remove the ^ and $ from the pattern and let `findall()` find matches anywhere in the text.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the `re.S` flag to make the dot match newline characters as well, but that might not be necessary.\n\nLet me adjust the pattern to remove the ^ and $:\n\n```regex\n[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\n```\n\nThis should allow the pattern to match emails anywhere in the text.\n\nI should also consider that there might be emails enclosed in angle brackets, like \"<user@example.com>\". To handle these, I can modify the pattern to optionally match the angle brackets.\n\nModified pattern:\n\n```regex\n<[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}>\n```\n\nBut to make it optional, I can make the angle brackets optional in the pattern.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```regex\n(<)?[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}(>)?\n```\n\nThis way, it will match both \"<user@example.com>\" and \"user@example.com\".\n\nEven better, I can use groups to capture only the email address without the angle brackets.\n\nAdjusted pattern:\n\n```regex\n(?<=<)?[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}(?=>)?\n```\n\nBut lookbehind and lookahead assertions can be tricky.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to capture the email part within optional angle brackets.\n\nLike this:\n\n```regex\n(?:<)?([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})(?:>)?\n```\n\nHere, `(?:)` is a non-capturing group, and `()` captures the email part.\n\nThen, in `findall()`, it will return only the captured email part, excluding the angle brackets.\n\nThat's smarter.\n\nSo, in the script, I can set the pattern as:\n\n```python\npattern = r'(?:<)?([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})(?:>)?'\n```\n\nAnd `re.findall(pattern, text)` will return a list of email addresses without the angle brackets, if present.\n\nPerfect.\n\nI should also consider that there might be multiple emails in the text, and I need to extract all of them.\n\nAdditionally, I should handle any encoding issues when reading the text file. Assuming the text is in UTF-8, I can specify that when opening the file.\n\nIn the script, I should use the 'with' statement to handle file opening and closing, which ensures that files are properly closed after their suite finishes.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the text might contain emails in different cases, like \"USER@EXAMPLE.COM\" or \"User@Example.com\". To standardize, I'll convert all emails to lowercase before writing them to the output file.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, according to RFC, the local part is case-sensitive, but for simplicity, I'll make the entire email lowercase to avoid duplicates.\n\nIf precision is crucial, I should only lowercase the domain part.\n\nBut that complicates the script, and for most practical purposes, treating emails as case-insensitive should be okay.\n\nNow, to remove duplicates, I'll store the emails in a set, which automatically handles uniqueness.\n\nThen, I'll write each unique email to the output file, each on a new line.\n\nI should also consider what happens if the input file doesn't exist or if there are no emails found.\n\nFor error handling:\n\n- If the input file doesn't exist, catch the FileNotFoundError and inform the user.\n\n- If no emails are found, perhaps print a message indicating that.\n\nLet me add that to the script.\n\nAdditionally, I can provide some feedback to the user, like how many emails were found and written to the file.\n\nFinally, I should test the script with a sample text file containing various email formats to ensure it works as expected.\n\nIn summary, here's the refined plan:\n\n1. **Read the input text file:**\n\n- Open the file in read mode with UTF-8 encoding.\n\n- Read the content into a string.\n\n2. **Define the regex pattern for email addresses:**\n\n- Use a pattern that matches emails with optional angle brackets and captures only the email part.\n\n3. **Find all occurrences of the pattern:**\n\n- Use `re.findall()` to get a list of all matching email addresses.\n\n4. **Convert emails to lowercase and remove duplicates:**\n\n- Use a set to store unique emails in lowercase.\n\n5. **Write the extracted emails to a new text file:**\n\n- Open a new file in write mode with UTF-8 encoding.\n\n- Write each email address on a new line.\n\n6. **Handle potential errors:**\n\n- Catch FileNotFoundError and inform the user.\n\n- Inform the user if no emails are found.\n\n7. **Provide feedback:**\n\n- Print the number of unique emails found and written to the file.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to implement the script based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python script that extracts all email addresses from a given text file using regular expressions and saves them into a new text file. The script will handle various email formats and ensure that duplicates are removed.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Read the Input File:**\n   - Open the specified text file and read its content.\n\n2. **Define the Regular Expression Pattern:**\n   - Use a regex pattern to match email addresses, considering optional angle brackets and capturing only the email part.\n\n3. **Extract Emails:**\n   - Use the `re.findall()` function to extract all occurrences of the email pattern from the text.\n\n4. **Remove Duplicates and Standardize:**\n   - Convert all emails to lowercase to handle case insensitivity and use a set to remove duplicates.\n\n5. **Write to Output File:**\n   - Write the unique emails to a new text file, each on a new line.\n\n6. **Error Handling:**\n   - Handle cases where the input file does not exist or no emails are found.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef main():\n    # Define input and output file names\n    input_filename = 'input.txt'\n    output_filename = 'emails.txt'\n    \n    try:\n        # Read the input file\n        with open(input_filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n            text = file.read()\n        \n        # Define the regex pattern for emails\n        pattern = r'(?:<)?([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})(?:>)?'\n        \n        # Find all emails\n        emails = re.findall(pattern, text)\n        \n        # Convert to lowercase to avoid duplicates\n        emails = [email.lower() for email in emails]\n        \n        # Remove duplicates\n        unique_emails = set(emails)\n        \n        # Write to output file\n        with open(output_filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n            for email in unique_emails:\n                file.write(email + '\\n')\n        \n        # Provide feedback\n        print(f\"Found {len(emails)} emails, of which {len(unique_emails)} are unique.\")\n        print(f\"Unique emails have been saved to {output_filename}\")\n    \n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: The file {input_filename} does not exist.\")\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading the Input File:**\n   - The script reads the entire content of the input text file into a string.\n\n2. **Regex Pattern for Emails:**\n   - The pattern `(?:<)?([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})(?:>)?` is designed to match email addresses, optionally enclosed in angle brackets, and captures only the email part.\n\n3. **Extracting Emails:**\n   - `re.findall()` is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the text.\n\n4. **Processing Emails:**\n   - Emails are converted to lowercase to handle case insensitivity and duplicates are removed using a set.\n\n5. **Writing to Output File:**\n   - Each unique email is written to a new text file, each on a new line.\n\n6. **Error Handling:**\n   - The script handles cases where the input file does not exist and other potential errors, providing user-friendly messages."
