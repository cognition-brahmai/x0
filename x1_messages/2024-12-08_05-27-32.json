        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units per day, and each unit requires 0.75 kilograms of raw material. I need to find out how many tons of raw material are needed for 30 days.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total number of units produced in 30 days. That would be:\n\n500 units/day \u00d7 30 days = 15,000 units\n\nNow, each unit requires 0.75 kilograms of raw material, so the total raw material needed in kilograms would be:\n\n15,000 units \u00d7 0.75 kg/unit = 11,250 kg\n\nBut the question asks for the amount in tons. I know that 1 ton is equal to 1,000 kilograms. So, to convert kilograms to tons, I can divide the total kilograms by 1,000:\n\n11,250 kg \u00f7 1,000 = 11.25 tons\n\nTherefore, the factory needs 11.25 tons of raw material to produce the products for 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.25} \\]"
