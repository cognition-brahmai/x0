        "content": "Let's see. So, in this election, Candidate A got 60% of the votes, and Candidate B got 40%. The total number of votes cast was 50,000. I need to find out how many more votes Candidate A received compared to Candidate B.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many votes each candidate received. Since Candidate A got 60% of the votes, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 50,000. Similarly, Candidate B got 40% of the votes, so that would be 40% of 50,000.\n\nLet me start by calculating Candidate A's votes:\n\n60% of 50,000 is (60/100) * 50,000.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n60 divided by 100 is 0.6.\n\nThen, 0.6 multiplied by 50,000 is 30,000.\n\nSo, Candidate A received 30,000 votes.\n\nNow, for Candidate B:\n\n40% of 50,000 is (40/100) * 50,000.\n\n40 divided by 100 is 0.4.\n\n0.4 multiplied by 50,000 is 20,000.\n\nSo, Candidate B received 20,000 votes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes Candidate A received than Candidate B, I need to subtract Candidate B's votes from Candidate A's votes.\n\nThat would be 30,000 minus 20,000, which equals 10,000.\n\nTherefore, Candidate A received 10,000 more votes than Candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, is there a shorter way to do this without calculating each candidate's votes separately?\n\nLet me think.\n\nThe difference in their percentages is 60% minus 40%, which is 20%.\n\nSo, 20% of the total votes would be the difference.\n\nLet me calculate 20% of 50,000.\n\n20% of 50,000 is (20/100) * 50,000.\n\n20 divided by 100 is 0.2.\n\n0.2 multiplied by 50,000 is 10,000.\n\nSo, again, the difference is 10,000 votes.\n\nThat's a quicker way. I should remember that for future problems.\n\nSo, the final answer is 10,000 votes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10000} \\]"
