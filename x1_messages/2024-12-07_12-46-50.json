        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car rental company charges $20 per day for renting the car, and there's an additional fee of $0.15 for every mile you drive. You want to know the total cost for renting the car for 4 days and driving it for 150 miles.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the cost of renting the car for 4 days. Since it's $20 per day, I can multiply 20 by 4.\n\n20 * 4 = 80\n\nSo, the rental cost for 4 days is $80.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for driving 150 miles. The fee is $0.15 per mile, so I multiply 0.15 by 150.\n\n0.15 * 150 = 22.5\n\nTherefore, the mileage cost is $22.50.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I add the rental cost and the mileage cost together.\n\n80 + 22.5 = 102.5\n\nSo, the total cost to rent the car for 4 days and drive it for 150 miles would be $102.50.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Some rental companies have a daily mileage allowance or different pricing structures, but based on the information provided, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes companies might have a minimum charge or extra fees for certain conditions, but here, it's just $20 per day plus $0.15 per mile. So, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the total cost per day including mileage, but since the mileage is charged per mile, it's better to keep them separate.\n\nSo, for 4 days, it's $20 per day, totaling $80. For 150 miles, it's $0.15 per mile, totaling $22.50. Adding them up gives $102.50.\n\nI think that's the correct total cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{102.50} \\]"
