        "content": "So, the car is going 60 miles per hour and it takes 5 hours to get where it's going. You want to know how far it traveled, right?\n\nWell, to figure out distance when you know speed and time, you can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 5 hours. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 5 hours\n\nWhen you multiply those, the hours cancel out, and you're left with miles.\n\nSo, 60 times 5 is 300.\n\nTherefore, the car traveled 300 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to think about this? Maybe using conversion factors or something like that?\n\nWell, 60 miles per hour means it travels 60 miles every hour. So, in one hour, it's 60 miles, in two hours it's 120 miles, and so on.\n\nSo, for 5 hours, it would be 60 miles/hour \u00d7 5 hours = 300 miles.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if you wanted to think about it in minutes, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 5 hours is 300 minutes.\n\nBut speed in miles per hour is more straightforward for this calculation.\n\nOr, if you wanted to convert the speed to miles per minute, it would be 60 miles per 60 minutes, which is 1 mile per minute.\n\nThen, in 300 minutes, it would travel 300 miles.\n\nBut that seems like more work when you can just multiply hours by the speed in miles per hour.\n\nSo, bottom line, the car traveled 300 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
