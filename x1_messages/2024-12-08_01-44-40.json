        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a rectangular room is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, and I need to find out what the area is in square yards. Okay, first things first, I know that area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, in this case, it would be 15 feet times 10 feet.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n\nArea = 15 ft \u00d7 10 ft\n\nArea = 150 square feet\n\nBut the question asks for the area in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square yards. I recall that 1 yard equals 3 feet, but since we're dealing with area, I need to think about square yards and square feet.\n\nMaybe I should figure out how many square feet are in one square yard. If 1 yard is 3 feet, then 1 square yard would be 3 feet by 3 feet, which is 9 square feet.\n\nSo, 1 square yard = 9 square feet.\n\nNow, to convert 150 square feet to square yards, I can divide the area in square feet by the number of square feet in one square yard.\n\nArea in square yards = area in square feet \u00f7 square feet per square yard\n\nArea in square yards = 150 ft\u00b2 \u00f7 9 ft\u00b2/yd\u00b2\n\nArea in square yards = 16.666... yd\u00b2\n\nBut maybe I should leave it as a fraction. 150 divided by 9 is the same as 50 divided by 3, because both numerator and denominator can be divided by 3.\n\nSo, 150 \u00f7 3 = 50\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\nTherefore, area = 50/3 square yards\n\nWhich is approximately 16.666... square yards, but as a fraction, it's 50/3 square yards.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if that makes sense. Another way to approach this is to convert the dimensions from feet to yards before calculating the area.\n\nSince 1 yard = 3 feet, then:\n\nLength in yards = 15 ft \u00f7 3 ft/yd = 5 yd\n\nWidth in yards = 10 ft \u00f7 3 ft/yd = 10/3 yd \u2248 3.333 yd\n\nNow, area in square yards = length in yards \u00d7 width in yards\n\nArea = 5 yd \u00d7 10/3 yd = 50/3 yd\u00b2\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the entire room. It's 15 feet by 10 feet, which is 150 square feet. Since there are 9 square feet in a square yard, dividing 150 by 9 should give me the number of square yards.\n\nLet me do that division again: 150 \u00f7 9.\n\n9 \u00d7 16 = 144\n\n150 - 144 = 6\n\nSo, 16 square yards with a remainder of 6 square feet.\n\nBut 6 square feet is part of another square yard. Since 9 square feet make a square yard, 6 square feet is 6/9, which simplifies to 2/3 of a square yard.\n\nTherefore, the total area is 16 and 2/3 square yards, which is the same as 50/3 square yards.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I imagine the room being tiled with square yard tiles. Each tile is 1 yard by 1 yard, which is 3 feet by 3 feet, or 9 square feet.\n\nThe room is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.\n\nAlong the length, which is 15 feet, and each tile is 3 feet, so 15 \u00f7 3 = 5 tiles along the length.\n\nAlong the width, which is 10 feet, each tile is 3 feet, so 10 \u00f7 3 = 3 tiles with a remainder of 1 foot.\n\nWait, but we're dealing with area, not just length.\n\nSo, 5 tiles along the length and 3 tiles along the width would cover 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 square yards.\n\nBut there's a remainder in width: 10 feet - 9 feet (3 tiles of 3 feet each) leaves 1 foot.\n\nSo, along the length, there are 5 tiles, and along the width, there are 3 full tiles plus a strip of 1 foot.\n\nBut since 1 foot is less than 3 feet, that strip doesn't make a full tile.\n\nSimilarly, along the length, there are 5 full tiles.\n\nSo, the full tiles are 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 square yards.\n\nNow, the remaining strip is 15 feet long (the entire length) and 1 foot high.\n\nThe area of this strip is 15 ft \u00d7 1 ft = 15 square feet.\n\nNow, to find out how many square yards that is, divide by 9:\n\n15 \u00f7 9 = 1.666... square yards, which is 5/3 square yards.\n\nSo, total area would be 15 yd\u00b2 + 5/3 yd\u00b2 = 45/3 yd\u00b2 + 5/3 yd\u00b2 = 50/3 yd\u00b2.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nThis reinforces that 50/3 square yards is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the room is 15 feet by 10 feet, and I want to find the area in square yards, I can first find the area in square feet and then convert.\n\nArea in square feet: 15 \u00d7 10 = 150 ft\u00b2.\n\nConversion factor: 1 square yard = 9 square feet.\n\nSo, area in square yards: 150 \u00f7 9 = 50/3 yd\u00b2.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the dimensions to yards first and then multiply.\n\nLength in yards: 15 ft \u00f7 3 = 5 yd.\n\nWidth in yards: 10 ft \u00f7 3 = 10/3 yd.\n\nArea: 5 \u00d7 10/3 = 50/3 yd\u00b2.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways.\n\nSo, the area of the room is 50/3 square yards, which is approximately 16.666... square yards.\n\nIf the question requires a fractional answer, 50/3 is precise.\n\nIf it needs to be a decimal, it's approximately 16.67 square yards, rounding to two decimal places.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify, I'll go with the exact fraction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{50}{3}\\text{ square yards}} \\]"
