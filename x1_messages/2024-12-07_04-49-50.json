        "content": "So John reads 2 books every month. To find out how many books he reads in a year, I need to multiply that by 12, since there are 12 months in a year. So, 2 books/month times 12 months/year equals 24 books/year. That's how many books John reads in a year.\n\nNow, Mary reads twice as many books as John does in a year. So, I take the number of books John reads in a year, which is 24, and multiply that by 2. So, 24 books/year times 2 equals 48 books/year.\n\nTherefore, Mary reads 48 books in a year.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. John reads 2 books per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so 2 times 12 is indeed 24 books per year. Then, since Mary reads twice as many as John, it's 24 times 2, which is 48. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it this way: if John reads 2 books a month, then Mary reads twice as many as John in a year. So, first find John's annual reading, which is 24 books, and then Mary's is twice that, so 48.\n\nOr, I could consider that if John reads 2 books a month, Mary reads twice as many in a year, which would be 4 books a month, because twice 2 is 4. Then, 4 books/month times 12 months/year equals 48 books/year. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think that's solid. So, Mary reads 48 books in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
