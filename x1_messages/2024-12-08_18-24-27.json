        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the farmer has 20 acres of land and wants to divide it into rectangular plots where the longest side is twice as long as the shortest side. We need to find the dimensions of each plot.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the relationship between the sides of the rectangle. Let's denote the shortest side as \\( x \\) and the longest side as \\( 2x \\), since it's twice as long.\n\nNow, the area of each rectangular plot can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one plot} = x \\times 2x = 2x^2\n\\]\n\nBut we don't know how many plots the farmer wants to divide the land into. The total land is 20 acres, so if there are \\( n \\) plots, then:\n\n\\[\nn \\times 2x^2 = 20\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but the problem doesn't specify the number of plots. Maybe I need to assume that the farmer is dividing the entire 20 acres into identical plots, but without knowing the number of plots, I can't proceed directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the dimensions of a single plot that uses up the entire 20 acres with the given side ratio.\n\nLet me consider that possibility. If there's only one plot covering all 20 acres, then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the plot} = 2x^2 = 20\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n2x^2 = 20 \\\\\nx^2 = 10 \\\\\nx = \\sqrt{10}\n\\]\n\nSo, the shortest side is \\( \\sqrt{10} \\) acres, and the longest side is \\( 2\\sqrt{10} \\) acres.\n\nBut maybe the farmer wants to divide the land into multiple plots of equal size, each with the longest side twice the shortest side. In that case, we need to know how many plots there are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the farmer is dividing the land into plots of this shape, and we need to find the dimensions in terms of acres.\n\nWait, acres are a measure of area, but dimensions are in length. We might need to convert acres to square feet or another unit if we're to find the actual lengths of the sides.\n\nLet me recall that 1 acre is equal to 43,560 square feet.\n\nSo, 20 acres is:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 43,560 = 871,200 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, if we consider the area of one plot in square feet, and denote the sides as \\( x \\) and \\( 2x \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one plot} = x \\times 2x = 2x^2 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nIf there are \\( n \\) such plots, then:\n\n\\[\nn \\times 2x^2 = 871,200\n\\]\n\nBut again, without knowing \\( n \\), we can't solve for \\( x \\).\n\nPerhaps the farmer is dividing the land into plots where each plot has an area of, say, 1 acre, 2 acres, etc., but that's assuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the dimensions of a single large rectangle (the entire farm) divided into smaller rectangles each with the longest side twice the shortest side.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's try another approach.\n\nLet's assume the farmer is dividing the entire 20 acres into rectangular plots, each with dimensions in the ratio 1:2.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the shorter side of each small plot as \\( w \\) and the longer side as \\( 2w \\).\n\nNow, we need to arrange these smaller rectangles within the larger area of 20 acres.\n\nBut without knowing how many plots there are or how they are arranged (e.g., in a grid), it's tricky to find exact dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to divide the 20 acres into plots where each plot has dimensions in the ratio 1:2, and we need to find the possible dimensions for such plots.\n\nIn that case, let's consider that each plot has an area that is a fraction of the total 20 acres.\n\nFor instance, if there are \\( n \\) plots, each plot would have an area of \\( \\frac{20}{n} \\) acres.\n\nThen, for each plot:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = w \\times 2w = 2w^2 = \\frac{20}{n}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[\nw^2 = \\frac{10}{n} \\\\\nw = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{n}}\n\\]\n\nAnd the longer side:\n\n\\[\nl = 2w = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{10}{n}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the dimensions of each plot would be \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{n}} \\) by \\( 2\\sqrt{\\frac{10}{n}} \\) acres, where \\( n \\) is the number of plots.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify \\( n \\), maybe it's expecting a general solution like this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the farmer is dividing the land into plots where the dimensions are in the ratio 1:2, and we need to find the largest possible plot that fits into the 20 acres.\n\nIn that case, to maximize the area of each plot, \\( n \\) should be as small as possible, ideally \\( n = 1 \\), meaning one large plot covering the entire 20 acres, with dimensions \\( \\sqrt{10} \\) by \\( 2\\sqrt{10} \\) acres.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the farmer is dividing the land into plots of equal size, and we need to find integer-valued dimensions.\n\nBut again, without more information, it's hard to pin down exact numbers.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the farmer is dividing the land into plots where the sides are in a 1:2 ratio, and find possible integer dimensions in feet.\n\nFirst, convert 20 acres to square feet:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 43,560 = 871,200 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nLet the dimensions of each plot be \\( w \\) feet by \\( 2w \\) feet, so the area of each plot is:\n\n\\[\n2w^2 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nIf there are \\( n \\) such plots, then:\n\n\\[\nn \\times 2w^2 = 871,200\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, if the farmer is dividing the land into a grid of such plots, say \\( a \\) plots along the shorter side and \\( b \\) plots along the longer side, then the total number of plots is \\( a \\times b \\), and:\n\n\\[\na \\times w = \\text{total shorter side length} \\\\\nb \\times 2w = \\text{total longer side length}\n\\]\n\nBut this is getting too complicated without more information.\n\nPerhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it, and it's just about finding the dimensions of a single plot that uses up the entire 20 acres with the longest side being twice the shortest side.\n\nIn that case, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\nLet the shorter side be \\( x \\) acres, and the longer side be \\( 2x \\) acres.\n\nThen, the area is:\n\n\\[\nx \\times 2x = 2x^2 = 20\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n2x^2 = 20 \\\\\nx^2 = 10 \\\\\nx = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162 \\text{ acres}\n\\]\n\nSo, the shorter side is approximately 3.162 acres, and the longer side is approximately 6.324 acres.\n\nBut acres are a measure of area, not length, so this might not make sense in terms of dimensions.\n\nWait, actually, acres are a measure of area, so when we talk about the dimensions of a plot in acres, it's misleading because dimensions are lengths. We should be talking about the dimensions in units like feet or meters.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nLet's denote the shorter side of the plot as \\( w \\) feet and the longer side as \\( 2w \\) feet.\n\nThen, the area of one plot is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = w \\times 2w = 2w^2 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nThe total area is 20 acres, which is 871,200 square feet.\n\nIf there are \\( n \\) plots, then:\n\n\\[\nn \\times 2w^2 = 871,200\n\\]\n\nBut without knowing \\( n \\), we can't solve for \\( w \\).\n\nAlternatively, if the farmer is dividing the land into plots where each plot has an area proportional to the total area, we need more information.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe the problem expects us to assume that the farmer is dividing the land into one large plot with dimensions in the ratio 1:2.\n\nIn that case, the area of the plot is 20 acres, and the dimensions are \\( x \\) by \\( 2x \\), where:\n\n\\[\nx \\times 2x = 2x^2 = 20 \\text{ acres}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n2x^2 = 20 \\\\\nx^2 = 10 \\\\\nx = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162 \\text{ acres}\n\\]\n\nBut again, acres are for area, not length. We need to express the dimensions in linear units like feet or meters.\n\nLet me try converting acres to square feet.\n\n1 acre = 43,560 square feet.\n\nSo, 20 acres = 20 \u00d7 43,560 = 871,200 square feet.\n\nNow, let's denote the shorter side as \\( w \\) feet and the longer side as \\( 2w \\) feet.\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\nw \\times 2w = 2w^2 = 871,200 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[\n2w^2 = 871,200 \\\\\nw^2 = 435,600 \\\\\nw = \\sqrt{435,600} = 660 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nSo, the shorter side is 660 feet, and the longer side is \\( 2 \\times 660 = 1,320 \\) feet.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of each plot are 660 feet by 1,320 feet.\n\nBut wait, is this making sense? If it's one plot, then yes, but if there are multiple plots, the total area would be divided among them.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to divide the 20 acres into multiple plots, each with dimensions in the ratio 1:2.\n\nIn that case, we need to know how many plots there are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the farmer is dividing the land into plots of a certain size, say 1 acre each, with dimensions in the ratio 1:2.\n\nIf each plot is 1 acre, then:\n\n\\[\nw \\times 2w = 2w^2 = 43,560 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[\n2w^2 = 43,560 \\\\\nw^2 = 21,780 \\\\\nw = \\sqrt{21,780} \\approx 147.58 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nSo, the shorter side is approximately 147.58 feet, and the longer side is approximately 295.16 feet.\n\nBut again, without knowing the number of plots, it's hard to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the dimensions of the plots in terms of acres, accepting that acres are a measure of area.\n\nIn that case, as earlier, with one plot:\n\n\\[\nx \\times 2x = 2x^2 = 20 \\\\\nx^2 = 10 \\\\\nx = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162 \\text{ acres}\n\\]\n\nSo, the shorter side is approximately 3.162 acres, and the longer side is approximately 6.324 acres.\n\nBut this seems odd because acres are for area, not length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the perimeter or other factors.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to divide the 20 acres into plots where the perimeter of each plot has the longest side twice the shortest side.\n\nBut that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to divide the land into rectangular plots with dimensions in the ratio 1:2, and find the dimensions in feet.\n\nIn that case, as previously calculated, the dimensions would be 660 feet by 1,320 feet for one plot.\n\nAlternatively, if the farmer is dividing the land into multiple plots, we need more information.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll assume the farmer is dividing the entire 20 acres into one large plot with dimensions in the ratio 1:2.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions are approximately 660 feet by 1,320 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{660 \\text{ feet} \\times 1320 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
