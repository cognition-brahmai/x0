        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a town with 600 people in total. First, it says that 2/3 of the population are adults. So, to find out how many adults there are, I need to calculate 2/3 of 600.\n\nLet me do that: 2/3 times 600 is (2 * 600) / 3 = 1200 / 3 = 400. So, there are 400 adults in the town.\n\nNext, it says that 1/4 of the adult population have children. So, to find out how many adults have children, I need to calculate 1/4 of 400.\n\nThat's (1/4) * 400 = 400 / 4 = 100. So, 100 adults have children.\n\nNow, the question is asking for how many adults do not have children. Since there are 400 adults in total and 100 of them have children, then the number of adults without children should be 400 - 100 = 300.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Total adults are 400, adults with children are 100, so adults without children are indeed 300. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any other factor involved here. The town has 600 people: 400 adults and the remaining should be children. So, 600 - 400 = 200 children.\n\nNow, it's said that 1/4 of the adults have children. Does this imply that these 100 adults are parents to these 200 children? Well, possibly, but I don't think that's relevant for this particular question.\n\nThe question is specifically asking for the number of adults who do not have children. I've calculated that to be 300, and my steps seem correct. So, I think the answer is 300 adults do not have children.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me verify the fractions.\n\nTotal population: 600\n\nAdults: 2/3 of 600 = 400\n\nAdults with children: 1/4 of 400 = 100\n\nAdults without children: 400 - 100 = 300\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
