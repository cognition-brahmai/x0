        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are four people: A, B, C, and D, each with a different number of candies. Person A has 3 more candies than person B, and person C has twice as many candies as person D. The total number of candies is 28. I need to find out how many candies each person has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to represent the number of candies each person has. Let's say:\n\n- Let B have X candies.\n\n- Then, A has X + 3 candies (since A has 3 more than B).\n\n- Let D have Y candies.\n\n- Then, C has 2Y candies (since C has twice as many as D).\n\nNow, since there are four people and the total number of candies is 28, I can write an equation that sums up all their candies:\n\nA + B + C + D = 28\n\nSubstituting the variables:\n\n(X + 3) + X + 2Y + Y = 28\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n2X + 3Y + 3 = 28\n\nLet's subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n2X + 3Y = 25\n\nNow, I have one equation with two variables. That's not enough to solve directly, so I need to find another relationship or make some assumptions.\n\nI remember that all the numbers should be positive integers because you can't have a negative number of candies, and probably not fractions either.\n\nAlso, since each person has a different number of candies, the variables should all be distinct.\n\nLet me try to find possible integer values for X and Y that satisfy 2X + 3Y = 25.\n\nI can solve for X in terms of Y:\n\n2X = 25 - 3Y\n\nX = (25 - 3Y)/2\n\nSince X must be an integer, (25 - 3Y) must be even.\n\nLet me try different integer values for Y:\n\nY=1: X=(25-3*1)/2=(25-3)/2=22/2=11\n\nY=2: X=(25-6)/2=19/2=9.5 (not an integer)\n\nY=3: X=(25-9)/2=16/2=8\n\nY=4: X=(25-12)/2=13/2=6.5 (not integer)\n\nY=5: X=(25-15)/2=10/2=5\n\nY=6: X=(25-18)/2=7/2=3.5 (not integer)\n\nY=7: X=(25-21)/2=4/2=2\n\nY=8: X=(25-24)/2=1/2=0.5 (not integer)\n\nY=9: X=(25-27)/2=(-2)/2=-1 (negative, not possible)\n\nSo, the possible integer solutions are:\n\nY=1, X=11\n\nY=3, X=8\n\nY=5, X=5\n\nY=7, X=2\n\nBut wait, X must be positive, so Y=7 gives X=2, which is positive, and Y=1 gives X=11, which is also positive.\n\nY=5 gives X=5, but wait, if X=5 and Y=5, then C=2Y=10 and D=5, A=X+3=8, B=5.\n\nSo, A=8, B=5, C=10, D=5. But B and D have the same number of candies, which is not allowed because each person has a different number. So this solution is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, Y=3 gives X=8: A=11, B=8, C=6, D=3. All different, which is good.\n\nY=1 gives X=11: A=14, B=11, C=2, D=1. Again, all different.\n\nY=7 gives X=2: A=5, B=2, C=14, D=7. But wait, C=14 and D=7, which are different.\n\nSo, possible solutions are:\n\n1. Y=1, X=11: A=14, B=11, C=2, D=1\n\n2. Y=3, X=8: A=11, B=8, C=6, D=3\n\n3. Y=5, X=5: invalid because B and D have the same number\n\n4. Y=7, X=2: A=5, B=2, C=14, D=7\n\nNow, I need to check if all these solutions satisfy the total of 28 candies.\n\nFirst solution: 14 + 11 + 2 + 1 = 28\n\nSecond solution: 11 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 28\n\nFourth solution: 5 + 2 + 14 + 7 = 28\n\nAll these solutions work. But the problem states that each person has a different number of candies. In the first solution, A=14, B=11, C=2, D=1: all different.\n\nIn the second solution, A=11, B=8, C=6, D=3: all different.\n\nIn the fourth solution, A=5, B=2, C=14, D=7: all different.\n\nSo, there are three possible sets of solutions:\n\n1. A=14, B=11, C=2, D=1\n\n2. A=11, B=8, C=6, D=3\n\n3. A=5, B=2, C=14, D=7\n\nWait a minute, but in the fourth solution, C=14 and D=7, which are different, and A=5, B=2: all different.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing. The problem says \"each person has a different number of candies.\" So, in each of these solutions, the numbers are distinct, so they all satisfy that.\n\nBut maybe there's only one correct answer based on additional constraints or perhaps the problem expects the solution with the smallest possible number of candies for A, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that A has more candies than B, which is already accounted for since A has 3 more than B.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each person has a different number of candies,\" which is already satisfied in all three solutions.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the number of candies should be positive integers greater than zero.\n\nIn all three solutions, candies are positive integers greater than zero.\n\nSo, all three solutions are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects only one solution, which might mean I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the possible values for Y.\n\nEarlier, I considered Y=1,3,5,7.\n\nBut Y=5 led to X=5, which made B and D have the same number of candies, which is invalid.\n\nSo, only Y=1,3,7 are valid.\n\nThus, there are three possible distributions:\n\n1. Y=1, X=11: A=14, B=11, C=2, D=1\n\n2. Y=3, X=8: A=11, B=8, C=6, D=3\n\n3. Y=7, X=2: A=5, B=2, C=14, D=7\n\nAll these satisfy the conditions given in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a specific order or has additional constraints that I haven't considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have assigned variables differently.\n\nLet me try assigning variables differently.\n\nLet me let D have Z candies.\n\nThen C has 2Z candies.\n\nLet B have W candies.\n\nThen A has W + 3 candies.\n\nNow, the total is A + B + C + D = (W + 3) + W + 2Z + Z = 2W + 3Z + 3 = 28\n\nSo, 2W + 3Z = 25\n\nThis is the same equation as before.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that all variables must be distinct.\n\nSo, in addition to 2W + 3Z = 25, I need W + 3 \u2260 W, which is always true, W + 3 \u2260 2Z, W + 3 \u2260 Z, W \u2260 2Z, W \u2260 Z, 2Z \u2260 Z (which implies Z \u2260 0, which is already true since Z > 0).\n\nSo, ensuring that all values are distinct.\n\nIn the solutions above:\n\n1. Z=1, W=11: A=14, B=11, C=2, D=1 \u2013 all distinct\n\n2. Z=3, W=8: A=11, B=8, C=6, D=3 \u2013 all distinct\n\n3. Z=7, W=2: A=5, B=2, C=14, D=7 \u2013 here, A=5, B=2, C=14, D=7 \u2013 all distinct\n\nSo, all three are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution where the person with the least candies has the smallest possible number, which would be D=1 in the first solution.\n\nOr perhaps where A has the most candies.\n\nIn the first solution, A has 14, which is the highest among all.\n\nIn the second, A has 11, and in the third, A has 5.\n\nSo, perhaps the intended solution is the first one, where A has the most candies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution where C has the most candies, which would be the third solution where C=14.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify who has the most candies, all three solutions are possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on the constraints, but in this case, there are multiple solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of candies must be positive integers greater than zero, which I already did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that A has more candies than C or something like that, but it doesn't specify.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem expects only one solution, which might mean I made an error in assuming multiple solutions are possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is indeterminate with the given information, and multiple solutions are possible.\n\nIn that case, I should present all possible solutions.\n\nSo, the possible distributions are:\n\n1. A=14, B=11, C=2, D=1\n\n2. A=11, B=8, C=6, D=3\n\n3. A=5, B=2, C=14, D=7\n\nAll these satisfy the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Solution 1: A=14, B=11, C=2, D=1} \\\\\n\\text{Solution 2: A=11, B=8, C=6, D=3} \\\\\n\\text{Solution 3: A=5, B=2, C=14, D=7}\n\\end{array}}"
