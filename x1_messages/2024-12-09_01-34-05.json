So, he gives away 2 from the 8 he has left. That means he should have 6 apples remaining. Wait, but let's double-check that.\n\nInitially, there are 12 apples.\n\nJohn takes away 4, so he has 4 apples.\n\nThen he gives 2 to Mary, so he should have 4 - 2 = 2 apples left.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because according to my first thought, he should have more. Let me think again.\n\nIf there are 12 apples on the table, and John takes away 4, that means he has 4 apples, and there are 8 left on the table. Then, he gives 2 of those 4 to Mary, so he has 4 - 2 = 2 apples left.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2 apples.\n\nBut the first time I thought about it, I mistakenly thought that the 12 apples were his to begin with, but actually, he starts with none and takes away 4 from the table, then gives 2 to Mary.\n\nSo, yes, John has 2 apples left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
