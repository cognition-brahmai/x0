        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to write a C# console application that does what you've described. So, the program needs to keep asking the user for integers between 1 and 100, and it should keep doing that until the user enters -1. Then, it should calculate the sum, product, and average of all the numbers entered before -1, and display those results. Also, I need to make sure that the input is validated, so that if the user enters something that's not an integer or a number outside the specified range, the program should handle that gracefully without crashing.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic console application in C#. I can do this by creating a new C# console project in Visual Studio or any other IDE I'm comfortable with. Once that's set up, I'll need to write a loop that keeps prompting the user for input until they enter -1.\n\nI should use a loop like a while loop, where the condition is that the input is not -1. Inside the loop, I'll ask the user to enter an integer between 1 and 100, and I'll need to validate that the input is indeed an integer within that range.\n\nFor input validation, I can use the int.TryParse method, which attempts to parse the input string into an integer and returns a boolean indicating whether it succeeded or not. If it succeeds, I can then check if the number is between 1 and 100. If it is, I'll add it to a list or keep a running total for the sum and product. If it's not within the range, I'll display an error message and prompt again.\n\nOnce the user enters -1, I'll need to calculate the sum, product, and average of the numbers they've entered. For the sum, I'll just add up all the numbers. For the product, I'll multiply them all together. For the average, I'll divide the sum by the number of entries.\n\nI need to be careful with the product because if the user enters a lot of numbers, the product could get very large and exceed the maximum value that an integer can hold in C#. So, maybe I should use a long or decimal for the product to handle larger values.\n\nAlso, for the average, I need to make sure that I don't divide by zero if the user enters -1 immediately without entering any numbers. So, I'll need to check if the count of numbers is greater than zero before calculating the average.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the numbers.\n\n2. Start a while loop that continues until the user enters -1.\n\n3. Inside the loop:\n\na. Prompt the user to enter an integer between 1 and 100.\n\nb. Use int.TryParse to attempt to parse the input.\n\nc. If parsing fails, display an error message.\n\nd. If parsing succeeds, check if the number is between 1 and 100.\n\ni. If it is, add it to the list.\n\nii. If it's not, display an error message.\n\n4. When -1 is entered, exit the loop.\n\n5. Calculate the sum by iterating through the list and adding up the numbers.\n\n6. Calculate the product by iterating through the list and multiplying the numbers, using a long or decimal to avoid overflow.\n\n7. Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count of numbers, if the count is greater than zero.\n\n8. Display the sum, product, and average.\n\nI should also consider formatting the average to a certain number of decimal places for better readability.\n\nLet me consider writing some pseudocode to outline this logic:\n\n```\n\nList<int> numbers = new List<int>();\n\nint input;\n\nwhile (true)\n\n{\n\n    Console.Write(\"Enter an integer between 1 and 100 (enter -1 to finish): \");\n\n    string inputStr = Console.ReadLine();\n\n    if (int.TryParse(inputStr, out input))\n\n    {\n\n        if (input == -1)\n\n        {\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n        else if (input >= 1 && input <= 100)\n\n        {\n\n            numbers.Add(input);\n\n        }\n\n        else\n\n        {\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Number must be between 1 and 100.\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    else\n\n    {\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\");\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (numbers.Count > 0)\n\n{\n\n    int sum = 0;\n\n    decimal product = 1;\n\n    foreach (int num in numbers)\n\n    {\n\n        sum += num;\n\n        product *= num;\n\n    }\n\n    double average = (double)sum / numbers.Count;\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Sum: \" + sum);\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Product: \" + product);\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Average: \" + average.ToString(\"F2\"));\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"No numbers were entered.\");\n\n}\n\n```\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. Now, I'll need to translate this pseudocode into actual C# code, making sure to handle all the edge cases, such as no numbers entered, all numbers being the same, etc.\n\nI should also think about how to handle potential overflow issues, especially with the product. Since the product can get very large very quickly, even with relatively small numbers, using a decimal might be a better choice than an int or long, as decimals have a larger range.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a loop to calculate the product and check for overflow at each step, but using a decimal seems simpler.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if the user enters a large number of items, storing them in a list might not be the most memory-efficient approach, but since the range is limited to 100, and assuming the user won't enter an unreasonably large number of items, it should be fine.\n\nI should also make sure that the program is user-friendly and provides clear instructions and error messages.\n\nOnce I have the basic functionality working, I might want to add some additional features, like allowing the user to enter negative numbers within a certain range or extending the range, but for now, I'll stick to the requirements.\n\nLet me proceed to write the actual C# code based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a C# console application that repeatedly prompts the user to enter integers between 1 and 100 until they enter -1. The program should then calculate and display the sum, product, and average of the entered numbers, excluding -1. We must ensure proper input validation and error handling.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - Use a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for input until -1 is entered.\n   - Validate the input to ensure it is an integer within the range 1 to 100 (excluding -1).\n\n2. **Data Storage**:\n   - Store the valid integers in a list for further calculations.\n\n3. **Calculations**:\n   - **Sum**: Add all the numbers in the list.\n   - **Product**: Multiply all the numbers in the list, using `decimal` to handle large values.\n   - **Average**: Compute the average by dividing the sum by the count of numbers.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Display the sum, product, and average with appropriate formatting.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        List<int> numbers = new List<int>();\n        int input;\n\n        while (true)\n        {\n            Console.Write(\"Enter an integer between 1 and 100 (enter -1 to finish): \");\n            string inputStr = Console.ReadLine();\n\n            if (int.TryParse(inputStr, out input))\n            {\n                if (input == -1)\n                {\n                    break;\n                }\n                else if (input >= 1 && input <= 100)\n                {\n                    numbers.Add(input);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Number must be between 1 and 100.\");\n                }\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (numbers.Count > 0)\n        {\n            int sum = numbers.Sum();\n            decimal product = numbers.Aggregate(1M, (acc, num) => acc * num);\n            double average = sum / (double)numbers.Count;\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Sum: \" + sum);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Product: \" + product);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Average: \" + average.ToString(\"F2\"));\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"No numbers were entered.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for input.\n   - It checks if the input is a valid integer using `int.TryParse`.\n   - If the input is -1, the loop breaks, terminating input collection.\n   - Valid numbers (1-100) are added to a list; invalid numbers prompt an error message.\n\n2. **Calculations**:\n   - **Sum**: Uses LINQ's `Sum` method to add up the numbers.\n   - **Product**: Uses `Aggregate` with multiplication to calculate the product, handling large results with `decimal`.\n   - **Average**: Computes the average by dividing the sum by the count of numbers.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - Results are displayed with appropriate labels, and the average is formatted to two decimal places for better readability."
