        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Java program that reads employee data from a CSV file and manages it using an ArrayList of Employee objects. I need to implement sorting functionalities based on different attributes like ID, name, age, and department, and then display the sorted list on the console.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the CSV file. It contains employee information in the following order: ID, name, age, department. Assuming the CSV file is comma-separated and doesn't contain any headers, each line will have these four pieces of information.\n\nI should start by defining the Employee class, which will hold the employee's ID, name, age, and department. Each of these attributes will need to be properly typed: ID as an integer, name as a string, age as an integer, and department as a string.\n\nNext, I need to read the CSV file and populate an ArrayList with Employee objects. For file reading, I can use Java's built-in classes like FileReader, BufferedReader, and split the lines by commas to extract the data.\n\nAfter that, I need to implement sorting functionalities. Java's Collections class provides a sort method that can be used with a Comparator. I'll need to create Comparator objects for each sorting criterion: ID, name, age, and department.\n\nFinally, I need to implement a method to display the sorted list on the console. This should iterate through the ArrayList and print each employee's information.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Define the Employee class with ID, name, age, and department attributes, along with a constructor and toString method for easy printing.\n\n2. Create a class, say EmployeeManager, which will handle file reading and sorting.\n\n3. In EmployeeManager, write a method to read the CSV file and populate an ArrayList<Employee>.\n\n4. Implement sorting methods for each attribute using Comparator.\n\n5. Implement a method to print the list.\n\n6. Provide a simple demo or main method to test the functionalities.\n\nI need to handle potential exceptions, such as file not found or incorrect data formats in the CSV. For simplicity, I'll assume the CSV is well-formed.\n\nLet's start by defining the Employee class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Java program that reads employee data from a CSV file and manages it using an `ArrayList` of `Employee` objects. We will implement sorting functionalities based on different attributes like ID, name, age, and department, and then display the sorted list on the console.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Define the Employee Class:**\n   - Create a class `Employee` with attributes: ID, name, age, and department.\n   - Implement a constructor to initialize these attributes.\n   - Override the `toString` method for easy printing.\n\n2. **Read the CSV File:**\n   - Use `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` to read the CSV file.\n   - Split each line by commas to extract employee data and create `Employee` objects.\n   - Store these objects in an `ArrayList`.\n\n3. **Implement Sorting Functionality:**\n   - Use Java's `Collections.sort` method with custom `Comparator`s for each sorting criterion (ID, name, age, department).\n\n4. **Display the Sorted List:**\n   - Iterate through the `ArrayList` and print each employee's information.\n\n5. **Main Method:**\n   - Demonstrate the reading, sorting, and displaying functionalities.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass Employee {\n    int id;\n    String name;\n    int age;\n    String department;\n\n    public Employee(int id, String name, int age, String department) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee [ID=\" + id + \", Name=\" + name + \", Age=\" + age + \", Department=\" + department + \"]\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class EmployeeManager {\n    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void readCSV(String filePath) {\n        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n            String line;\n            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n                String[] values = line.split(\",\");\n                int id = Integer.parseInt(values[0]);\n                String name = values[1];\n                int age = Integer.parseInt(values[2]);\n                String department = values[3];\n                employees.add(new Employee(id, name, age, department));\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void sortById() {\n        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.id));\n    }\n\n    public void sortByName() {\n        employees.sort(Comparator.comparing(e -> e.name));\n    }\n\n    public void sortByAge() {\n        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.age));\n    }\n\n    public void sortByDepartment() {\n        employees.sort(Comparator.comparing(e -> e.department));\n    }\n\n    public void display() {\n        for (Employee e : employees) {\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        EmployeeManager manager = new EmployeeManager();\n        manager.readCSV(\"employees.csv\");\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted by ID:\");\n        manager.sortById();\n        manager.display();\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Name:\");\n        manager.sortByName();\n        manager.display();\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Age:\");\n        manager.sortByAge();\n        manager.display();\n        System.out.println(\"\\nSorted by Department:\");\n        manager.sortByDepartment();\n        manager.display();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Employee Class:**\n   - Holds employee data and provides a string representation for easy printing.\n\n2. **EmployeeManager Class:**\n   - Manages reading employee data from a CSV file and sorting/displaying the data.\n   - `readCSV` method reads the file and populates the `ArrayList`.\n   - Sorting methods use `Comparator`s to sort the list based on different attributes.\n   - `display` method prints the list of employees.\n\n3. **Main Method:**\n   - Demonstrates reading the CSV, sorting the data in different ways, and displaying the results.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program is modular, easy to understand, and maintains clean separation of concerns."
