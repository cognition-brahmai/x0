        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 3 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, in total, there are 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 balls in the box. The problem is asking for the probability of drawing one ball of each color when you draw 3 balls without replacement.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a ball, I don't put it back into the box. So, each draw depends on the previous one because the total number of balls decreases with each draw.\n\nNow, the event we're interested in is drawing one red, one blue, and one green ball in any order. So, the order doesn't matter here; it's the combination that counts.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use combinations because the order doesn't matter. The total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 12 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{12}{3}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to draw one red ball out of 3 is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{1}\n\\]\n\nOne blue ball out of 4:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{1}\n\\]\n\nAnd one green ball out of 5:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{1}\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes should be the product of these individual combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = \\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{5}{1}\n\\]\n\nThen, the probability is the ratio of favorable ways to the total ways:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one of each color}) = \\frac{\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{5}{1}}{\\binom{12}{3}}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate these values.\n\nFirst, \\(\\binom{12}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220\n\\]\n\nNext, \\(\\binom{3}{1}\\), \\(\\binom{4}{1}\\), and \\(\\binom{5}{1}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{1} = 3, \\quad \\binom{4}{1} = 4, \\quad \\binom{5}{1} = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the favorable ways are:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{60}{220} = \\frac{3}{11}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, is that simplest form? Let's check. 60 and 220 can both be divided by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60 \\div 20}{220 \\div 20} = \\frac{3}{11}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's simplest.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by considering the sequence of draws, since it's without replacement, but I think the combination approach is more straightforward for this problem.\n\nLet me just double-check with the sequential approach to confirm.\n\nSo, if I consider drawing three balls one by one without replacement, the probability of getting one of each color can be calculated by considering all possible orders of drawing red, blue, and green.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 possible orders: RBG, RGB, BRG, BGR, GRB, GBR.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for one order and then multiply by the number of orders.\n\nTake RBG for example:\n\nProbability of first draw being red:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{R first}) = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, probability of second draw being blue:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{B second} | \\text{R first}) = \\frac{4}{11}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that the first was red and second was blue, probability of third draw being green:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{G third} | \\text{R first and B second}) = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability for the RBG sequence is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{11} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{22}\n\\]\n\nSince there are 6 such sequences, the total probability is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\frac{1}{22} = \\frac{6}{22} = \\frac{3}{11}\n\\]\n\nOkay, this matches the earlier result from the combination approach.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing one ball of each color is \\(\\frac{3}{11}\\).\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{11}} \\]"
