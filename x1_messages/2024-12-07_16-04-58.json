        "content": "This sounds like a riddle! Let me try to solve it. So, it says \"Stealthy as a shadow in the dead of night, cunning but affectionate if given a bite.\" Hmm, something that's stealthy and active at night, probably an animal. Maybe a cat? Cats are known for being stealthy and affectionate, especially if you feed them. But then it says, \"Never owned but often loved.\" That might not fit cats perfectly, since people do own cats. Wait, maybe it's a wild animal that people don't own but still appreciate or love.\n\nLet me think about other animals that are active at night, stealthy, and cunning. Like owls, but owls aren't really affectionate. Maybe foxes? Foxes are known for their cunning nature and are active at night. They are also quite stealthy. And people often admire them even if they don't own them.\n\nThe next line is \"At my sport considered cruel, but that's because you never know me at all.\" What sport might a fox be known for? Maybe hunting? Foxes hunt small animals like rodents and birds, which some people might consider cruel, but it's just their natural behavior. So, perhaps the answer is a fox.\n\nBut let me consider if there are other possibilities. Maybe it's not an animal at all. Maybe it's a person, like a burglar or a thief, who is stealthy and cunning, and perhaps affectionate if treated nicely. But then, \"never owned but often loved\" doesn't really fit a burglar. So, maybe it's still an animal.\n\nAnother thought: could it be a mouse or a rat? They are stealthy at night, cunning, and some people might keep them as pets and love them, but generally, they are considered pests. But the \"affectionate if given a bite\" part seems off, because giving a bite to a mouse wouldn't make it affectionate.\n\nWait, maybe it's a snake? Some snakes are nocturnal, stealthy, and considered cunning. And some people keep them as pets and love them. But again, \"affectionate if given a bite\" doesn't really fit snakes, as they don't show affection in that way.\n\nI'm going to stick with fox as the answer. It seems to fit most of the descriptions provided in the riddle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{fox}} \\]"
