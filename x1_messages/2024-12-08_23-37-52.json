Okay, let's break this down. I remember that compound interest means the interest is added to the principal amount at certain intervals, and then future interest is calculated on that new total.\n\nFirst, I need to know the formula for compound interest. I think it's something like A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount, which is $5,000 in this case.\n\n- r is the annual interest rate, which is 4%, but I need to write that as a decimal, so that's 0.04.\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded quarterly, that means four times a year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for, in years, which is 3 years here.\n\nSo, plugging in these values into the formula:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step. First, calculate the interest rate per period:\n\n0.04 divided by 4 is 0.01.\n\nSo, 1 plus 0.01 is 1.01.\n\nNow, raise 1.01 to the power of 4 times 3, which is 12.\n\nSo, 1.01 to the power of 12.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1.01 to the power of 12 is approximately 1.126825.\n\nNow, multiply that by the principal amount:\n\n5000 times 1.126825 equals 5634.125.\n\nSo, after 3 years, the person will have approximately $5,634.13.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check those calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nP = $5,000\n\nr = 4% = 0.04\n\nn = 4 (since it's compounded quarterly)\n\nt = 3 years\n\nSo,\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3)\n\n= 5000(1 + 0.01)^12\n\n= 5000(1.01)^12\n\nNow, calculating (1.01)^12:\n\n1.01^12 \u2248 1.126825\n\nThen,\n\nA \u2248 5000 * 1.126825 = 5634.125\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final amount is approximately $5,634.13.\n\nI think that's the answer, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the interest earned each quarter and add it up over the 3 years. Since it's compounded quarterly, the interest is added every 3 months.\n\nFirst, find the quarterly interest rate:\n\nAnnual rate is 4%, so quarterly rate is 4%/4 = 1%.\n\nNow, each quarter, the interest is 1% of the current amount, and that interest is added to the principal for the next quarter.\n\nSo, for each quarter, the amount is multiplied by 1.01.\n\nOver 3 years, there are 4 quarters per year, so 12 quarters in total.\n\nSo, starting with $5,000, after 12 quarters, the amount is:\n\n5000 * (1.01)^12 \u2248 5000 * 1.126825 = 5634.125\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is the same.\n\nTherefore, the final amount after 3 years is approximately $5,634.13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5634.13} \\]"
