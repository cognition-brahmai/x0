Among the options provided, the best description of the purpose of a 'turn' in a sonnet is:\n\nB. To signal a change in theme or mood\n\nTo elaborate, a sonnet is a 14-line poem that follows a specific rhyme scheme and is characterized by a 'turn,' also known as a 'volta.' This turn typically occurs around the ninth or twelfth line and marks a shift in the poem's direction, often introducing a new perspective, resolving a conflict, or offering a counterargument to the ideas presented in the preceding lines.\n\nOption A, \"to introduce a new character,\" might occur within a sonnet, but it is not the primary purpose of the turn. Sonnets are generally focused on a single theme or idea rather than developing multiple characters.\n\nOption C, \"to end the poem with a rhyming couplet,\" refers to the concluding two lines of some sonnet forms, like the Shakespearean sonnet, but the turn can occur earlier and is not solely about the ending couplet.\n\nOption D, \"to establish the poem's meter,\" pertains to the rhythmic structure of the poem, which is indeed important in sonnets (typically iambic pentameter), but again, this is not the role of the turn.\n\nTherefore, option B accurately captures the essence of the turn in a sonnet, which is to signal a change in theme or mood, thereby adding depth and complexity to the poem's overall structure and meaning."
