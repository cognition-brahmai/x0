        "content": "Let's see. So, the train travels at two different speeds for different durations, and I need to find the average speed for the entire trip. I know that average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? So, maybe I should calculate the total distance first.\n\nFirst, it travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. So, the distance covered in that part is speed times time, which is 60 mph times 2 hours, equals 120 miles.\n\nThen, it travels at 80 mph for 3 hours. So, the distance for this part is 80 mph times 3 hours, which is 240 miles.\n\nNow, the total distance is 120 miles plus 240 miles, which equals 360 miles.\n\nThe total time is 2 hours plus 3 hours, which is 5 hours.\n\nSo, the average speed should be total distance divided by total time, which is 360 miles divided by 5 hours. That equals 72 mph.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? I remember that when speeds are different for different parts of the trip, you can't just average the speeds directly. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAnother way to calculate average speed is to use the harmonic mean if the distances are the same, but in this case, the distances are different because the times are different. Hmm.\n\nLet me think again. The definition of average speed is total distance over total time. I think I've applied that correctly. So, maybe 72 mph is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me see if there's another approach. Maybe using the weighted average of the speeds.\n\nSo, the train was at 60 mph for 2 hours and 80 mph for 3 hours. So, the weights are the times spent at each speed.\n\nSo, the weighted average would be (60 mph * 2 hours + 80 mph * 3 hours) divided by total time, which is 5 hours. That's (120 + 240) divided by 5, which is 360 divided by 5, which is again 72 mph.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, I think 72 mph is the correct average speed for the entire trip.\n\nBut why do I have a feeling that something might be missing? Maybe I should consider if the train traveled the same distance at each speed, but in this case, the times are different, so the distances are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for average speed when you have different speeds for different durations. Let me recall.\n\nI think the general formula is total distance over total time, which is what I've done. Unless the question is trickier and involves acceleration or something, but it doesn't seem to suggest that. It says the train travels at an average speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, then at 80 mph for another 3 hours.\n\nSo, assuming that the speeds are constant during each portion, my calculation should hold.\n\nMaybe I can look it up online to confirm, but since I'm supposed to solve it here, I'll stick with my answer of 72 mph.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. If the train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and 80 mph for 3 hours, what if I think about it in terms of the distance covered in each hour?\n\nIn the first hour, it travels 60 miles. In the second hour, another 60 miles. Then, in the next three hours, it travels 80 miles each hour, so 80 miles in the third hour, 80 in the fourth, and 80 in the fifth hour.\n\nSo, total distance is 60 + 60 + 80 + 80 + 80 = 360 miles in 5 hours. Again, average speed is 360 miles divided by 5 hours, which is 72 mph.\n\nI keep getting the same answer, which reinforces my confidence that 72 mph is correct.\n\nPerhaps I'm overthinking it, but I can't see any flaw in this reasoning. So, I'm ready to conclude that the average speed for the entire trip is 72 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
