        "content": "So there are 8 houses on the street, numbered from 1 to 8. House number 4 is painted blue, and all the others are painted white. I need to find out the probability that if I choose one house at random, it's not the blue one.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, total number of houses is 8. Only one house is blue, which is house number 4. So, the number of houses that are not blue is 8 minus 1, which is 7.\n\nProbability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the houses that are not blue, which is 7, and the total possible outcomes are all the houses, which is 8.\n\nSo, the probability should be 7/8.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I can think about the probability of choosing the blue house and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of not choosing it.\n\nThe probability of choosing the blue house is 1/8, since there's only one blue house out of eight. So, 1 minus 1/8 would be 7/8.\n\nOkay, both ways give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the probability that the house I choose is not painted blue is 7/8.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. Is there anything about the houses being numbered that could influence the probability? I don't think so, because the numbering is just labels and shouldn't affect the randomness of the selection.\n\nAlso, the fact that only one house is blue and the rest are white seems straightforward. No house has any other color, right? So, it's just blue or white.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible outcomes: houses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Out of these, house 4 is blue, and the others are white. So, if I pick one at random, there are 8 equally likely possibilities.\n\nThe event of picking a house that is not blue corresponds to picking any of houses 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, or 8\u2014seven options.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 7/8.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. Unless there's some trick or additional information that I'm missing in the problem, but based on what's given, the answer should be 7/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{8}} \\]"
