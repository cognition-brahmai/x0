        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, there are 100 lockers, all starting closed. Students walk down the hall one by one. The first student opens every single locker. The second student starts at locker 2 and closes every other locker. The third student starts at locker 3 and changes the state of every third locker, and so on, up to the 100th student who only changes the state of the 100th locker.\n\nI need to figure out how many lockers are left open after all these students have passed by.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what each student is doing. The first student opens all lockers, so now all are open. The second student starts at locker 2 and closes every other one, so lockers 2, 4, 6, up to 100 are closed. Now, the third student starts at locker 3 and changes every third locker's state, so lockers 3, 6, 9, up to 99. This means that locker 3 was open, now it's closed; locker 6 was closed, now it's open; and so on.\n\nThis pattern continues with each subsequent student changing the state of lockers at multiples of their own number.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can find a pattern or a mathematical way to approach this.\n\nLet me think about what happens to each individual locker. Take locker number 1, for example. It's opened by the first student and no one else touches it because only the first student's multiple is 1. So, locker 1 remains open.\n\nLocker number 2: opened by the first student, closed by the second student, and no one else touches it. So, it's closed.\n\nLocker number 3: opened by the first, closed by the second, then opened by the third. No one else touches it. So, it's open.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's verify:\n\n- Student 1: opens all lockers, so locker 3 is open.\n\n- Student 2: closes every other locker, so locker 3 is not affected because it's odd.\n\n- Student 3: changes locker 3, so it was open, now it's closed.\n\nWait, but in my earlier thought, I said student 3 opens it, but actually, student 3 changes it from open to closed.\n\nWait, maybe I need to be more systematic.\n\nLet's consider a smaller number of lockers to see the pattern. Suppose there are 4 lockers.\n\n- Student 1: opens all (1,2,3,4)\n\n- Student 2: closes every second locker (2 and 4)\n\n- Student 3: changes every third locker (3)\n\n- Student 4: changes the fourth locker\n\nSo, after student 1: all open\n\nAfter student 2: 1(open), 2(closed), 3(open), 4(closed)\n\nAfter student 3: 1(open), 2(closed), 3(closed), 4(closed)\n\nAfter student 4: 1(open), 2(closed), 3(closed), 4(open)\n\nSo, in this case, lockers 1 and 4 are open.\n\nAnother smaller case, say 6 lockers.\n\n- Student 1: opens all (1,2,3,4,5,6)\n\n- Student 2: closes 2,4,6\n\n- Student 3: changes 3,6\n\n- Student 4: changes 4\n\n- Student 5: changes 5\n\n- Student 6: changes 6\n\nAfter student 1: all open\n\nAfter student 2: 1(open), 2(closed), 3(open), 4(closed), 5(open), 6(closed)\n\nAfter student 3: 1(open), 2(closed), 3(closed), 4(closed), 5(open), 6(open)\n\nAfter student 4: 1(open), 2(closed), 3(closed), 4(open), 5(open), 6(open)\n\nAfter student 5: 1(open), 2(closed), 3(closed), 4(open), 5(closed), 6(open)\n\nAfter student 6: 1(open), 2(closed), 3(closed), 4(open), 5(closed), 6(closed)\n\nSo, in this case, lockers 1 and 4 are open.\n\nHmm, a pattern is emerging here. It seems that only lockers with an odd number of state changes will be open at the end.\n\nEach locker is changed by students whose numbers are divisors of the locker number.\n\nFor example, locker 6 is changed by students 1, 2, 3, and 6. That's four times: open, close, open, close. So, it ends up closed.\n\nLocker 4 is changed by students 1, 2, and 4: open, close, open. So, it ends up open.\n\nLocker 3 is changed by students 1 and 3: open, close. So, it ends up closed.\n\nLocker 1 is only changed by student 1: open. So, it ends up open.\n\nSo, the number of times a locker is changed is equal to the number of divisors it has.\n\nIf a locker has an odd number of divisors, it will be open; otherwise, it will be closed.\n\nNow, which numbers have an odd number of divisors?\n\nMost numbers have divisors in pairs. For example, 6: 1 and 6, 2 and 3. So, even number of divisors.\n\nPerfect squares have an odd number of divisors because one of the divisors is repeated. For example, 4: 1, 2, 2. But actually, we list unique divisors: 1, 2.\n\nWait, no. For 4, divisors are 1, 2, 4. That's three divisors.\n\nSimilarly, 9: 1, 3, 9. Three divisors.\n\n16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. Five divisors.\n\nSo, perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n\nTherefore, lockers that are perfect squares will be left open.\n\nSo, in 100 lockers, the perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.\n\nThat's 10 lockers.\n\nSo, the answer should be 10 lockers left open.\n\nBut let me double-check with the earlier smaller cases.\n\nIn the case of 4 lockers, perfect squares are 1 and 4, which matches the earlier result that lockers 1 and 4 are open.\n\nIn the case of 6 lockers, perfect squares are 1 and 4, which also matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, in 100 lockers, there should be 10 perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.\n\nHence, 10 lockers are left open.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
