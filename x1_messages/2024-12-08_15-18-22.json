        "content": "I believe the city you're referring to is Babylon. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were said to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, although there is some debate among historians about their exact location and existence. According to legend, the gardens were built by King Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 BCE for his queen, Amytis, who missed the greenery of her homeland. The gardens were designed with a series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, which were said to have had a remarkable system of irrigation. However, despite their fame, there is limited archaeological evidence for their existence, leading some scholars to suggest that they may have been purely mythical or located elsewhere, such as in Nineveh."
