        "content": "So I've got this problem here about shipping packages with different types of trucks, each having different capacities and costs. The goal is to minimize transportation costs while making sure all 10,000 packages are delivered. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we have:\n\n- Small trucks: capacity 100 packages, cost $200 per trip\n\n- Medium trucks: capacity 250 packages, cost $400 per trip\n\n- Large trucks: capacity 500 packages, cost $600 per trip\n\nI need to find the combination of these trucks that can carry exactly 10,000 packages while spending the least amount of money.\n\nHmm, this sounds like an optimization problem. Specifically, it seems like a linear programming problem where I need to minimize cost subject to the constraint that the total number of packages is 10,000.\n\nLet me define some variables:\n\n- Let x be the number of small trucks\n\n- Let y be the number of medium trucks\n\n- Let z be the number of large trucks\n\nThe total number of packages carried would be:\n\n100x + 250y + 500z = 10,000\n\nAnd the total cost would be:\n\n200x + 400y + 600z = C (where C is the total cost to minimize)\n\nSo, I need to minimize C = 200x + 400y + 600z subject to 100x + 250y + 500z = 10,000\n\nAlso, x, y, z must be non-negative integers because you can't have a negative number of trucks.\n\nThis seems similar to the classic \"knapsack problem\" where you try to maximize value without exceeding capacity, but in this case, it's about minimizing cost while meeting a specific capacity.\n\nMaybe I can start by seeing how many large trucks I would need if I only used large trucks.\n\nEach large truck carries 500 packages, so 10,000 / 500 = 20 large trucks.\n\nThe cost would be 20 * $600 = $12,000.\n\nIs there a way to use fewer large trucks and add medium or small trucks to make it cheaper?\n\nLet's see what happens if I use 19 large trucks: 19 * 500 = 9,500 packages.\n\nThen I need to transport the remaining 500 packages.\n\nI could use one large truck, but that would still be 20 large trucks total, which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could use medium trucks for the remaining 500 packages.\n\nSince each medium truck carries 250 packages, I would need 2 medium trucks: 2 * 250 = 500.\n\nThe cost would be 19 * $600 + 2 * $400 = $11,400 + $800 = $12,200.\n\nThat's actually more than $12,000, so not better.\n\nWhat if I use 18 large trucks: 18 * 500 = 9,000 packages.\n\nThen I need to transport the remaining 1,000 packages.\n\nI could use two large trucks, but that would be 20 large trucks again.\n\nAlternatively, use medium trucks: 1,000 / 250 = 4 medium trucks.\n\nCost would be 18 * $600 + 4 * $400 = $10,800 + $1,600 = $12,400.\n\nStill higher than $12,000.\n\nWhat if I use 15 large trucks: 15 * 500 = 7,500 packages.\n\nThen I need to transport the remaining 2,500 packages.\n\nI could use medium trucks: 2,500 / 250 = 10 medium trucks.\n\nCost would be 15 * $600 + 10 * $400 = $9,000 + $4,000 = $13,000.\n\nAgain, higher than $12,000.\n\nHmm, seems like using fewer large trucks and more medium trucks increases the cost.\n\nWhat about using small trucks?\n\nLet's say I use only large and small trucks.\n\nSuppose I use 20 large trucks: 20 * 500 = 10,000 packages, cost $12,000.\n\nAlternatively, use 19 large trucks: 19 * 500 = 9,500 packages.\n\nRemaining 500 packages can be carried by 5 small trucks: 5 * 100 = 500.\n\nCost would be 19 * $600 + 5 * $200 = $11,400 + $1,000 = $12,400.\n\nStill higher than $12,000.\n\nWhat if I use 10 large trucks: 10 * 500 = 5,000 packages.\n\nRemaining 5,000 packages would require 50 small trucks: 50 * 100 = 5,000.\n\nCost would be 10 * $600 + 50 * $200 = $6,000 + $10,000 = $16,000.\n\nWay higher than $12,000.\n\nThis suggests that using large trucks exclusively might be the cheapest option.\n\nBut let's see if there's a combination of all three truck types that can lower the cost.\n\nSuppose I use 15 large trucks: 15 * 500 = 7,500 packages.\n\nRemaining 2,500 packages.\n\nI could use a combination of medium and small trucks for this.\n\nFor example, use 10 medium trucks: 10 * 250 = 2,500.\n\nCost: 15 * $600 + 10 * $400 = $9,000 + $4,000 = $13,000.\n\nOr use 25 small trucks: 25 * 100 = 2,500.\n\nCost: 15 * $600 + 25 * $200 = $9,000 + $5,000 = $14,000.\n\nBoth higher than $12,000.\n\nWhat if I use 16 large trucks: 16 * 500 = 8,000 packages.\n\nRemaining 2,000 packages.\n\nUse 8 medium trucks: 8 * 250 = 2,000.\n\nCost: 16 * $600 + 8 * $400 = $9,600 + $3,200 = $12,800.\n\nStill higher than $12,000.\n\nAlternatively, use 20 small trucks: 20 * 100 = 2,000.\n\nCost: 16 * $600 + 20 * $200 = $9,600 + $4,000 = $13,600.\n\nWorse than $12,000.\n\nIt seems like any deviation from using only large trucks increases the cost.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider using fewer large trucks and more medium and small trucks in a way that the cost is less.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet's calculate the cost per package for each truck type.\n\n- Small truck: $200 for 100 packages \u2192 $2 per package\n\n- Medium truck: $400 for 250 packages \u2192 $1.60 per package\n\n- Large truck: $600 for 500 packages \u2192 $1.20 per package\n\nInteresting, the larger the truck, the lower the cost per package.\n\nSo, intuitively, using as many large trucks as possible should minimize the cost.\n\nThat aligns with what I've observed in the earlier trials.\n\nBut maybe there's a twist here.\n\nWait, what if I can fill the trucks to full capacity, and perhaps there's a way to optimize that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a combination where the total cost is less than $12,000.\n\nLet me consider using only medium and small trucks.\n\nSuppose I use only medium trucks.\n\nNumber of medium trucks needed: 10,000 / 250 = 40 trucks.\n\nCost: 40 * $400 = $16,000.\n\nHigher than $12,000.\n\nUsing only small trucks:\n\nNumber of small trucks needed: 10,000 / 100 = 100 trucks.\n\nCost: 100 * $200 = $20,000.\n\nWay higher than $12,000.\n\nSo, using only large trucks seems cheapest.\n\nBut maybe there's a combination where I use large and medium trucks together more efficiently.\n\nLet me try using 17 large trucks: 17 * 500 = 8,500 packages.\n\nRemaining 1,500 packages.\n\nUse 6 medium trucks: 6 * 250 = 1,500.\n\nCost: 17 * $600 + 6 * $400 = $10,200 + $2,400 = $12,600.\n\nStill higher than $12,000.\n\nAlternatively, use 15 large trucks: 15 * 500 = 7,500 packages.\n\nRemaining 2,500 packages.\n\nUse 5 medium trucks: 5 * 250 = 1,250.\n\nRemaining 1,250 packages.\n\nWait, 5 medium trucks would carry 1,250 packages, leaving 1,250 packages still to be carried.\n\nThen, I'd need 1,250 / 100 = 12.5 small trucks.\n\nBut I can't have half a truck, so 13 small trucks: 13 * 100 = 1,300.\n\nTotal packages carried: 7,500 + 1,250 + 1,300 = 10,050, which is over the required 10,000.\n\nCost: 15 * $600 + 5 * $400 + 13 * $200 = $9,000 + $2,000 + $2,600 = $13,600.\n\nAgain, higher than $12,000.\n\nThis suggests that any deviation from using only large trucks increases the cost.\n\nMaybe I should consider that large trucks are the most cost-effective, and using them exclusively is the cheapest option.\n\nBut let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose I fix the number of large trucks and see how the cost changes with different combinations of medium and small trucks for the remainder.\n\nFor example, use 18 large trucks: 18 * 500 = 9,000 packages.\n\nRemaining 1,000 packages.\n\nOption 1: Use 4 medium trucks: 4 * 250 = 1,000.\n\nCost: 18 * $600 + 4 * $400 = $10,800 + $1,600 = $12,400.\n\nOption 2: Use 10 small trucks: 10 * 100 = 1,000.\n\nCost: 18 * $600 + 10 * $200 = $10,800 + $2,000 = $12,800.\n\nOption 3: Use a combination of medium and small trucks.\n\nFor example, 2 medium trucks: 2 * 250 = 500.\n\nRemaining 500 packages.\n\nUse 5 small trucks: 5 * 100 = 500.\n\nTotal cost: 18 * $600 + 2 * $400 + 5 * $200 = $10,800 + $800 + $1,000 = $12,600.\n\nStill higher than $12,000.\n\nIt seems consistent that using only large trucks is cheaper.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's a way to use fewer large trucks and more medium trucks in a way that the cost decreases.\n\nLet me try using 16 large trucks: 16 * 500 = 8,000 packages.\n\nRemaining 2,000 packages.\n\nUse 8 medium trucks: 8 * 250 = 2,000.\n\nCost: 16 * $600 + 8 * $400 = $9,600 + $3,200 = $12,800.\n\nHigher than $12,000.\n\nAlternatively, use 14 large trucks: 14 * 500 = 7,000 packages.\n\nRemaining 3,000 packages.\n\nUse 12 medium trucks: 12 * 250 = 3,000.\n\nCost: 14 * $600 + 12 * $400 = $8,400 + $4,800 = $13,200.\n\nAgain, higher than $12,000.\n\nThis pattern suggests that as I decrease the number of large trucks and increase medium trucks, the total cost increases.\n\nSimilarly, adding small trucks also increases the cost.\n\nTherefore, it seems that using only large trucks is the most cost-effective option.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's a way to use a combination of all three truck types to minimize the cost further.\n\nSuppose I use 19 large trucks: 19 * 500 = 9,500 packages.\n\nRemaining 500 packages.\n\nOption 1: Use 1 large truck: total 20 large trucks, cost $12,000.\n\nOption 2: Use 2 medium trucks: 2 * 250 = 500, cost 19 * $600 + 2 * $400 = $11,400 + $800 = $12,200.\n\nOption 3: Use 5 small trucks: 5 * 100 = 500, cost 19 * $600 + 5 * $200 = $11,400 + $1,000 = $12,400.\n\nAll higher than $12,000.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe there's a way to minimize the number of trucks by using a combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at the cost per package again.\n\nSince large trucks have the lowest cost per package, followed by medium, then small, it makes sense to prioritize large trucks.\n\nBut maybe there's a break-even point where using a different combination could be cheaper.\n\nLet me try to set up the problem mathematically.\n\nWe have:\n\n100x + 250y + 500z = 10,000\n\nAnd we need to minimize C = 200x + 400y + 600z\n\nThis is a linear programming problem with integer constraints.\n\nTo solve this, I can try to express one variable in terms of the others.\n\nLet me solve for x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = (10,000 - 250y - 500z)/100\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = 100 - 2.5y - 5z\n\nBut x must be a non-negative integer, so 2.5y + 5z \u2264 100, and x = 100 - 2.5y - 5z.\n\nHowever, since x must be an integer, 2.5y must result in a half integer, but y is an integer, so 2.5y will have a .5 if y is odd, and .0 if y is even.\n\nThis complicates things, maybe I should try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the cost per package for each truck type:\n\n- Small: $2 per package\n\n- Medium: $1.60 per package\n\n- Large: $1.20 per package\n\nSince large trucks have the lowest cost per package, it's beneficial to use as many large trucks as possible.\n\nGiven that, using 20 large trucks seems optimal.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to use fewer large trucks and more medium and small trucks to reduce the total cost, but from the earlier trials, it doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a volume discount or some other factor, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven the information provided, using only large trucks seems to be the most cost-effective option.\n\nTherefore, the optimal combination is to use 20 large trucks, with a total cost of $12,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20 \\text{ large trucks at a total cost of } \\$12,000} \\]\n"
