        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that goes from City A to City B at 90 km/h and comes back at 120 km/h, and the whole trip takes 8 hours. We need to find the distance between City A and City B.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to find the distance between two cities, given the speeds in both directions and the total time for the round trip.\n\nLet's denote the distance between City A and City B as \\( d \\) kilometers.\n\nNow, we know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, the time taken to go from City A to City B is \\( \\frac{d}{90} \\) hours, and the time taken to return from City B to City A is \\( \\frac{d}{120} \\) hours.\n\nThe total time for the round trip is the sum of these two times, which is given as 8 hours. So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{90} + \\frac{d}{120} = 8\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( d \\).\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 90 and 120. The least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 120 is 360.\n\nSo, we can rewrite each fraction with the denominator of 360.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{90} = \\frac{d \\times 4}{90 \\times 4} = \\frac{4d}{360}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{120} = \\frac{d \\times 3}{120 \\times 3} = \\frac{3d}{360}\n\\]\n\nNow, add these two fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4d}{360} + \\frac{3d}{360} = \\frac{7d}{360}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this sum equals 8 hours:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7d}{360} = 8\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( d \\), we can solve for \\( d \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 360 and then dividing by 7.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 360:\n\n\\[\n7d = 8 \\times 360\n\\]\n\n\\[\n7d = 2880\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{2880}{7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd \\approx 411.4286\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance between City A and City B is approximately 411.43 kilometers.\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense. If the train goes at 90 km/h and returns at 120 km/h, the average speed isn't just the average of 90 and 120 because the speeds are for the same distance but in opposite directions.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for average speed for the round trip, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{speed}_1 \\times \\text{speed}_2}{\\text{speed}_1 + \\text{speed}_2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{2 \\times 90 \\times 120}{90 + 120} = \\frac{2 \\times 10800}{210} = \\frac{21600}{210} = 102.8571 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nNow, if the average speed is approximately 102.86 km/h and the total time is 8 hours, the total distance for the round trip would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = \\text{average speed} \\times \\text{total time} = 102.8571 \\times 8 \\approx 822.8571 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nSince this is the round trip distance, the one-way distance between City A and City B would be half of that:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{822.8571}{2} \\approx 411.4286 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the distance between City A and City B is approximately 411.43 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{411.43} \\]"
