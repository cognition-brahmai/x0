        "content": "So there's this probability problem here. Let's see: in a class, there are 12 boys and 8 girls. We need to find the probability that if we randomly select two students, both are girls.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to remember how probability works. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of students is 12 boys plus 8 girls, which is 20 students.\n\nNow, we're selecting two students. I need to figure out how many ways there are to select two students out of 20, and how many ways there are to select two girls out of 8.\n\nI think this is a combination problem because the order in which we select the students doesn't matter. It's just about who is selected, not the order.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 students out of 20 is C(20, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(20, 2) = 20! / (2!(20 - 2)!) = (20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 18!) = (20 \u00d7 19) / 2 = 190.\n\nSo, there are 190 possible pairs of students.\n\nNow, the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 8 is C(8, 2).\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8 - 2)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6!) = (8 \u00d7 7) / 2 = 28.\n\nSo, there are 28 possible pairs of girls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both selected students are girls is the number of favorable outcomes (selecting 2 girls) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (selecting any 2 students).\n\nSo, probability = 28 / 190.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2.\n\n28 \u00f7 2 = 14\n\n190 \u00f7 2 = 95\n\nSo, 14/95.\n\nAlternatively, I can leave it as a decimal. Let's see:\n\n28 divided by 190 is approximately 0.147368.\n\nSo, the probability is about 0.147 or 14.7%.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using probabilities sequentially.\n\nLike, the probability that the first student selected is a girl, and then the second student selected is also a girl, given that the first one was a girl.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nThe probability that the first student selected is a girl is 8 girls out of 20 students, which is 8/20 = 2/5.\n\nThen, if the first student selected is a girl, there are now 7 girls left and 19 students left in total.\n\nSo, the probability that the second student selected is also a girl is 7/19.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability is (2/5) \u00d7 (7/19) = (2 \u00d7 7) / (5 \u00d7 19) = 14/95.\n\nSo, that matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both selected students are girls is 14/95.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}} \\]"
