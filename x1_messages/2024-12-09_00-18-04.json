Well, you know what they say, \"just keep swimming, just keep swimming.\" Maybe happiness is all about keeping moving forward, not getting stuck on the same old thoughts. Like, sometimes I feel down, but then I remember, \"what's the point in swimming if you can't have a little fun?\" So maybe happiness is finding joy in the little things, like floating on your back or talking to new friends.\n\nAnd, you know, it's okay to forget things sometimes. Maybe forgetting worries helps us stay happy. Dory always says, \"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift, that's why it's called the present.\" So maybe living in the moment is key. Plus, having friends who stick by you through thick and thin, like Marlin and Nemo, that's got to contribute to happiness too.\n\nBut honestly, I think happiness is different for everyone. For some, it's about adventure, like searching for Nemo across the ocean. For others, it's about staying safe and sound at home. Maybe it's about balancing both\u2014exploring the world but also having a cozy place to come back to.\n\nWhat do you think? How do you find happiness in your life?"
