        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 100 red marbles and 100 blue marbles in a bag, making a total of 200 marbles. I need to find the probability of drawing exactly 3 red marbles in my first 5 draws, and I'm drawing without replacement. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes for drawing 5 marbles out of 200. Since the order in which I draw them doesn't matter for this problem, I should use combinations, not permutations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw 5 marbles out of 200 is C(200, 5). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(200, 5) = 200! / (5!(200 - 5)!) = (200 \u00d7 199 \u00d7 198 \u00d7 197 \u00d7 196) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 2,535,529,400.\n\nOkay, that's the denominator for my probability fraction.\n\nNow, for the numerator, I need to find the number of ways to draw exactly 3 red marbles and 2 blue marbles in those 5 draws.\n\nThere are 100 red marbles and 100 blue marbles.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 red marbles out of 100 is C(100, 3), and the number of ways to choose 2 blue marbles out of 100 is C(100, 2).\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is C(100, 3) \u00d7 C(100, 2).\n\nLet me calculate C(100, 3):\n\nC(100, 3) = 100! / (3!(100 - 3)!) = (100 \u00d7 99 \u00d7 98) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 161,700.\n\nAnd C(100, 2):\n\nC(100, 2) = 100! / (2!(100 - 2)!) = (100 \u00d7 99) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 4,950.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 161,700 \u00d7 4,950 = 800,115,000.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too large. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw 5 marbles: C(200, 5) = 2,535,529,400.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 red marbles: C(100, 3) = 161,700.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 blue marbles: C(100, 2) = 4,950.\n\nSo, favorable outcomes = 161,700 \u00d7 4,950 = 800,115,000.\n\nNow, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes:\n\nP = 800,115,000 / 2,535,529,400.\n\nLet me simplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 100:\n\nP = 8,001,150 / 25,355,294.\n\nHmm, does this fraction simplify further? Let's check if numerator and denominator have any common factors.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate this decimal division directly.\n\n8,001,150 \u00f7 25,355,294 \u2248 0.3154.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.3154, or 31.54%.\n\nWait a second, that seems a bit high. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this in terms of hypergeometric distribution, since I'm sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) \u00d7 C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (200 marbles)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (100 red marbles)\n\n- n is the number of draws (5 marbles)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (3 red marbles)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 3) = [C(100, 3) \u00d7 C(100, 2)] / C(200, 5)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, P(X = 3) = (161,700 \u00d7 4,950) / 2,535,529,400 = 800,115,000 / 2,535,529,400 \u2248 0.3154.\n\nAlternatively, to get a more exact fraction, I can leave it as 800,115,000 / 2,535,529,400.\n\nBut perhaps I can simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 1,000:\n\n800,115 / 2,535,529.4\n\nBut since denominators should be integers, maybe I can divide numerator and denominator by 100:\n\n8,001.15 / 25,355.294\n\nThat's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the original values before dividing by 100:\n\n800,115,000 / 2,535,529,400\n\nBoth numbers are divisible by 50:\n\n800,115,000 \u00f7 50 = 16,002,300\n\n2,535,529,400 \u00f7 50 = 50,710,588\n\nSo, P = 16,002,300 / 50,710,588\n\nIs this reducible further? Let's check.\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n16,002,300 \u00f7 4 = 4,000,575\n\n50,710,588 \u00f7 4 = 12,677,647\n\nSo, P = 4,000,575 / 12,677,647\n\nI don't think this fraction can be simplified further.\n\nTherefore, the exact probability is 4,000,575 / 12,677,647, which is approximately 0.3154, or 31.54%.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly 3 red marbles in the first 5 draws is about 31.54%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.3154} \\]"
