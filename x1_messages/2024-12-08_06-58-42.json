        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To accomplish this task, you'll need to have MongoDB installed and running on your machine, and also install the `pymongo` library in Python, which is the official MongoDB driver for Python.\n\nFirst, make sure you have `pymongo` installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pymongo\n```\n\nNow, let's write the Python script step by step.\n\n1. **Connect to the MongoDB database:**\n\n   You need to import the `pymongo` module and connect to your MongoDB instance. For this example, I'll assume that your MongoDB server is running locally on the default port (27017) and that you don't have authentication enabled.\n\n   ```python\n   from pymongo import MongoClient\n\n   # Connect to the MongoDB server\n   client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a new database or access an existing one:**\n\n   In MongoDB, you can create a new database or access an existing one by naming it. For this example, let's use a database named \"mydatabase\".\n\n   ```python\n   # Access the database\n   db = client['mydatabase']\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a new collection or access an existing one:**\n\n   Similarly, you can create a new collection or access an existing one by naming it. Here, we'll create a collection named \"employees\".\n\n   ```python\n   # Access the collection\n   collection = db['employees']\n   ```\n\n4. **Insert sample employee data:**\n\n   Let's insert some sample data into the \"employees\" collection. Each employee document will have fields for \"name\", \"age\", and \"department\".\n\n   ```python\n   # Sample employee data\n   employees = [\n       {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"department\": \"HR\"},\n       {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"department\": \"Tech\"},\n       {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"department\": \"HR\"},\n       {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 28, \"department\": \"Tech\"}\n   ]\n\n   # Insert the sample data into the collection\n   collection.insert_many(employees)\n   ```\n\n5. **Create a function to query employees from a specific department:**\n\n   Now, let's define a function that takes a department name as input and returns all employees from that department.\n\n   ```python\n   def get_employees_by_department(department):\n       # Query the collection for employees in the specified department\n       employees = collection.find({\"department\": department})\n       # Print the results\n       for employee in employees:\n           print(employee)\n   ```\n\n6. **Test the function:**\n\n   To verify that everything works as expected, let's call the function with a specific department, say \"HR\".\n\n   ```python\n   # Test the function\n   print(\"Employees in HR department:\")\n   get_employees_by_department(\"HR\")\n   ```\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete script:\n\n```python\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n# Connect to the MongoDB server\nclient = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n\n# Access the database\ndb = client['mydatabase']\n\n# Access the collection\ncollection = db['employees']\n\n# Sample employee data\nemployees = [\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"department\": \"HR\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"department\": \"Tech\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"department\": \"HR\"},\n    {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 28, \"department\": \"Tech\"}\n]\n\n# Insert the sample data into the collection\ncollection.insert_many(employees)\n\ndef get_employees_by_department(department):\n    # Query the collection for employees in the specified department\n    employees = collection.find({\"department\": department})\n    # Print the results\n    for employee in employees:\n        print(employee)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(\"Employees in HR department:\")\nget_employees_by_department(\"HR\")\n```\n\nThis script will connect to your MongoDB server, create a database named \"mydatabase\" (if it doesn't exist), create a collection named \"employees\", insert the sample employee data, and then query and print all employees from the \"HR\" department.\n\nMake sure your MongoDB server is running before executing this script.
