        "content": "Sure! A happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.\n\nHere's how you can implement a function in Python to check if a number is a happy number:\n\n```python\ndef is_happy(n):\n    def get_next(number):\n        return sum(int(char) ** 2 for char in str(number))\n    \n    seen = set()\n    while n != 1 and n not in seen:\n        seen.add(n)\n        n = get_next(n)\n    \n    return n == 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **get_next Function**: This inner function takes a number and returns the sum of the squares of its digits. For example, if the number is 19, it calculates \\(1^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 81 = 82\\).\n\n2. **Loop Detection**: We use a set called `seen` to keep track of numbers we've already processed. If we encounter a number that's already in this set, it means we're stuck in a loop and the number is not happy.\n\n3. **Main Loop**: We keep replacing the number with the next number until we either reach 1 (happy number) or detect a loop (not a happy number).\n\nYou can test this function with various numbers to see if they are happy numbers. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(is_happy(19))  # Output: True\nprint(is_happy(2))   # Output: False\n```\n\nThis should correctly identify whether a given number is a happy number or not."
