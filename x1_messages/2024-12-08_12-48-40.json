        "content": "Let's tackle this equation: (4x^2 - 9) / (2x + 3) = 2x - 3.\n\nFirst off, I notice that the left side has a numerator that looks familiar. 4x^2 - 9 is a difference of squares, which I know can be factored. The general form for a difference of squares is a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). So, in this case, a is 2x and b is 3, right? Because (2x)^2 is 4x^2 and 3^2 is 9.\n\nSo, 4x^2 - 9 = (2x - 3)(2x + 3). That's helpful because the denominator is 2x + 3. So, I can rewrite the left side as:\n\n(2x - 3)(2x + 3) / (2x + 3).\n\nNow, as long as 2x + 3 isn't zero, I can cancel out the (2x + 3) in the numerator and the denominator. So, that leaves me with just 2x - 3 on the left side.\n\nSo now, my equation is:\n\n2x - 3 = 2x - 3.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Both sides are the same. Does that mean every value of x is a solution? Well, not so fast. I need to consider if there are any restrictions on x.\n\nRemember earlier, I canceled out (2x + 3), but that's only valid if 2x + 3 \u2260 0. Because division by zero is undefined.\n\nSo, let's solve for x in 2x + 3 = 0 to find any excluded values.\n\n2x + 3 = 0\n\n2x = -3\n\nx = -3/2.\n\nSo, x cannot be -3/2 because that would make the denominator zero.\n\nBut looking back at the equation 2x - 3 = 2x - 3, that's always true unless x makes the denominator zero. So, it seems like the equation holds for all x except x = -3/2.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let's test it with a specific value.\n\nLet's pick x = 0.\n\nLeft side: (4(0)^2 - 9)/(2(0) + 3) = (-9)/3 = -3.\n\nRight side: 2(0) - 3 = -3.\n\nSo, it checks out for x = 0.\n\nLet's try x = 1.\n\nLeft side: (4(1)^2 - 9)/(2(1) + 3) = (4 - 9)/(2 + 3) = (-5)/5 = -1.\n\nRight side: 2(1) - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1.\n\nAgain, it matches.\n\nNow, let's try x = -3/2.\n\nWait, x = -3/2 makes the denominator zero, so it's undefined on the left side.\n\nSo, the equation is true for all x except x = -3/2.\n\nIs there a way to confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach the problem differently. Let's try cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominator.\n\nStarting again:\n\n(4x^2 - 9)/(2x + 3) = 2x - 3.\n\nMultiply both sides by (2x + 3):\n\n4x^2 - 9 = (2x - 3)(2x + 3).\n\nWait a second, that's the same as:\n\n4x^2 - 9 = 4x^2 - 9.\n\nWhich is always true.\n\nSo, again, this suggests that the equation holds for all x, but we have to remember that x cannot be -3/2 because that makes the denominator zero.\n\nSo, the solution is all real numbers except x = -3/2.\n\nAlternatively, in interval notation, that would be (-\u221e, -3/2) U (-3/2, \u221e).\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x \\in (-\\infty, -\\frac{3}{2}) \\cup (-\\frac{3}{2}, \\infty)} \\]"
