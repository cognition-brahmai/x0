        "content": "Let's see. So, the train normally travels at an average speed of 80 km/h and it takes 5 hours to go between two cities. If the train could increase its average speed by 25%, I need to find out how much time would be saved on the journey.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the distance between the two cities. Since speed is distance over time, distance should be speed multiplied by time. So, distance equals 80 km/h times 5 hours, which is 400 kilometers.\n\nNow, if the train increases its average speed by 25%, what's the new speed? 25% of 80 km/h is 20 km/h, so the new speed would be 80 plus 20, which is 100 km/h.\n\nNext, I need to find out how long it would take to travel the same distance at this new speed. Time is distance divided by speed, so 400 km divided by 100 km/h should be 4 hours.\n\nOriginally, it took 5 hours, and now it takes 4 hours, so the time saved would be 5 hours minus 4 hours, which is 1 hour.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I can check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the distance: 80 km/h times 5 h equals 400 km. That's correct.\n\nIncreasing speed by 25%: 80 km/h * 0.25 = 20 km/h, so new speed is 100 km/h. Alright.\n\nTime at new speed: 400 km / 100 km/h = 4 hours. Yes.\n\nTime saved: 5 h - 4 h = 1 h. Seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer: 1 hour is saved on the journey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ hour}} \\]"
