        "content": "So there are 100 people in a room. 60% of them are wearing glasses, and 40% of those wearing glasses also have brown hair. I need to find out what percentage of the total people have both glasses and brown hair.\n\nFirst, I'll find out how many people are wearing glasses. Since 60% of 100 people are wearing glasses, that means:\n\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 100 = 60 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nSo, 60 people are wearing glasses.\n\nNext, 40% of those wearing glasses also have brown hair. So, 40% of 60 people have both glasses and brown hair:\n\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 60 = 24 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find out what percentage 24 people are of the total 100 people in the room. To find the percentage, I use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{24}{100} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 24\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 24% of the people in the room have both glasses and brown hair.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24\\%} \\]"
