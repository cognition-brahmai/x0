        "content": "Let's see. So, in this group, there are twice as many women as men. That means if there are M men, there are 2M women. So the total number of people in the group is M + 2M = 3M.\n\nNow, 20% of the women wear glasses. Since there are 2M women, the number of women wearing glasses is 20% of 2M, which is 0.2 * 2M = 0.4M.\n\nSimilarly, 50% of the men wear glasses. So, the number of men wearing glasses is 50% of M, which is 0.5M.\n\nTo find the total number of people wearing glasses, we add the women and men wearing glasses: 0.4M + 0.5M = 0.9M.\n\nNow, the total number of people in the group is 3M. So, the percentage of the entire group that wears glasses is (0.9M / 3M) * 100%.\n\nSimplifying that, 0.9M divided by 3M is 0.3, and 0.3 multiplied by 100% is 30%.\n\nSo, 30% of the entire group wears glasses.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are 100 men. Then, there would be 200 women, making a total of 300 people.\n\n20% of the women wear glasses: 20% of 200 is 40 women.\n\n50% of the men wear glasses: 50% of 100 is 50 men.\n\nSo, total number wearing glasses is 40 + 50 = 90.\n\nPercentage of the group wearing glasses: (90 / 300) * 100% = 30%.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous calculation. So, the answer should be 30%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30\\%} \\]"
