        "content": "So I've got this differential equation to solve: dy/dx = y/x, and there's an initial condition y(1) = 2. I need to find the function y in terms of x that satisfies both the equation and the condition. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that this is a separable differential equation. That means I can rearrange the equation so that all the y terms are on one side and all the x terms are on the other side. This makes it easier to integrate both sides.\n\nSo, starting with dy/dx = y/x, I can rewrite this as:\n\ndy/y = dx/x\n\nNow, I need to integrate both sides. The left side with respect to y and the right side with respect to x.\n\nIntegrating both sides, I get:\n\n\u222b(1/y) dy = \u222b(1/x) dx\n\nI know that the integral of 1/y with respect to y is ln|y|, and the integral of 1/x with respect to x is ln|x|. So, this gives me:\n\nln|y| = ln|x| + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, to solve for y, I can exponentiate both sides to get rid of the natural logarithm.\n\nSo, e^(ln|y|) = e^(ln|x| + C)\n\nSimplifying this, I get:\n\n|y| = e^(ln|x|) * e^C\n\nSince e^(ln|x|) is just |x|, and e^C is just some positive constant, let's call it C1, then:\n\n|y| = C1 |x|\n\nNow, since y can be negative as well, I can write this as:\n\ny = C x\n\nWhere C is an arbitrary constant (which could be positive or negative).\n\nSo, the general solution to the differential equation dy/dx = y/x is y = C x.\n\nBut I also have an initial condition: y(1) = 2. That means when x = 1, y should be 2. I can use this to find the value of C.\n\nPlugging in x = 1 and y = 2 into the general solution:\n\n2 = C * 1\n\nSo, C = 2.\n\nTherefore, the particular solution that satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition is:\n\ny = 2x\n\nLet me just double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with dy/dx = y/x.\n\nIf y = 2x, then dy/dx = 2.\n\nAnd y/x = 2x / x = 2.\n\nSo, dy/dx = y/x = 2, which checks out.\n\nAlso, y(1) = 2*1 = 2, which satisfies the initial condition.\n\nLooks good to me!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{y = 2x} \\]"
