        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have ratios between different types of fruits and a specific number of oranges, and we need to find out how many apples and bananas there are in total.\n\nFirst, let's note down what we know:\n\n1. The ratio of apples to oranges is 3:2.\n\n2. The ratio of oranges to bananas is 5:4.\n\n3. There are 120 oranges.\n\nOur goal is to find the total number of apples and bananas.\n\nLet's start by understanding the ratios.\n\nThe ratio of apples to oranges is 3:2. This means that for every 3 apples, there are 2 oranges.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of oranges to bananas is 5:4, meaning that for every 5 oranges, there are 4 bananas.\n\nBut we have a problem here. The number of oranges in the two ratios is different: in the first ratio, it's 2 oranges, and in the second, it's 5 oranges. To combine these ratios, we need to make the number of oranges the same in both ratios.\n\nTo do this, we can find a common multiple of the oranges in both ratios. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 5 is 10.\n\nSo, we'll adjust both ratios so that the number of oranges is 10.\n\nFirst ratio: apples to oranges is 3:2.\n\nTo make oranges 10, we multiply both parts of the ratio by 5 (because 2 * 5 = 10).\n\nSo, apples:oranges = 3*5 : 2*5 = 15:10.\n\nSecond ratio: oranges to bananas is 5:4.\n\nTo make oranges 10, we multiply both parts by 2 (since 5 * 2 = 10).\n\nSo, oranges:bananas = 5*2 : 4*2 = 10:8.\n\nNow, we can combine these ratios into a single ratio of apples/oranges/bananas, which is 15:10:8.\n\nThis means that for every 15 apples, there are 10 oranges and 8 bananas.\n\nBut we know from the problem that there are 120 oranges.\n\nSo, we can set up a proportion to find out the multiplier for the ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the multiplier as x.\n\nSo, oranges = 10x = 120.\n\nSolving for x: x = 120 / 10 = 12.\n\nNow that we have x, we can find the number of apples and bananas.\n\nApples = 15x = 15 * 12 = 180.\n\nBananas = 8x = 8 * 12 = 96.\n\nTherefore, the total number of apples and bananas is 180 + 96 = 276.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, we adjusted the ratios to have the same number of oranges, which was 10.\n\nThen, we found that oranges are 10x = 120, so x = 12.\n\nThen, apples are 15x = 15*12 = 180.\n\nBananas are 8x = 8*12 = 96.\n\nTotal apples and bananas: 180 + 96 = 276.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet\u2019s try another method to verify.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Apples/oranges = 3/2.\n\n- Oranges/bananas = 5/4.\n\nAnd oranges = 120.\n\nFirst, find apples:\n\nApples/oranges = 3/2.\n\nSo, apples = (3/2) * oranges = (3/2) * 120 = 180.\n\nNow, find bananas:\n\nOranges/bananas = 5/4.\n\nSo, bananas = (4/5) * oranges = (4/5) * 120 = 96.\n\nTotal apples and bananas: 180 + 96 = 276.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nWait, is there any other way to look at this?\n\nLet\u2019s see, maybe using the combined ratio directly.\n\nWe have apples:oranges = 3:2.\n\nOranges:bananas = 5:4.\n\nTo combine these, we can write apples:oranges:bananas.\n\nBut to combine them, we need to make the oranges part the same in both ratios.\n\nWhich is what we did earlier by adjusting to 10.\n\nAlternatively, we can multiply the ratios.\n\nBut I think the first method is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using variables.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nA = number of apples.\n\nO = number of oranges.\n\nB = number of bananas.\n\nGiven:\n\nA/O = 3/2.\n\nO/B = 5/4.\n\nAnd O = 120.\n\nFrom A/O = 3/2, we get A = (3/2) * O.\n\nSubstitute O = 120:\n\nA = (3/2)*120 = 180.\n\nFrom O/B = 5/4, we get B = (4/5)*O.\n\nSubstitute O = 120:\n\nB = (4/5)*120 = 96.\n\nTotal A + B = 180 + 96 = 276.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of proportions or cross-multiplication.\n\nBut I think the methods above are sufficient and accurate.\n\nLet\u2019s consider if there is any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:2, and the ratio of oranges to bananas is 5:4, with 120 oranges.\n\nWe have used this information directly.\n\nIs there any other way the ratios could be interpreted?\n\nI don't think so; ratios are generally taken as direct comparisons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios are meant to be combined differently, but our method seems standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a way to set up equations and solve simultaneously.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nGiven:\n\nA/O = 3/2.\n\nO/B = 5/4.\n\nO = 120.\n\nFrom A/O = 3/2, A = (3/2)O.\n\nFrom O/B = 5/4, B = (4/5)O.\n\nSo, A + B = (3/2)O + (4/5)O.\n\nSubstitute O = 120:\n\nA + B = (3/2)*120 + (4/5)*120.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(3/2)*120 = 180.\n\n(4/5)*120 = 96.\n\nTotal: 180 + 96 = 276.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nIt seems consistent across multiple methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the ratios in terms of least common multiples or something, but it's unnecessary since we already have a consistent answer.\n\nLet\u2019s consider if the answer makes sense.\n\nWe have 120 oranges.\n\nApples are in a 3:2 ratio with oranges, so apples should be (3/2)*120 = 180.\n\nBananas are in a 4:5 ratio with oranges, so bananas should be (4/5)*120 = 96.\n\nTotal apples and bananas: 180 + 96 = 276.\n\nYes, that seems logical and consistent.\n\nI think we can confidently say the total number of apples and bananas is 276.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{276} \\]"
