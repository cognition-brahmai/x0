        "content": "The ancient civilization responsible for building the iconic pyramids at Giza, the Sphinx, and other monumental structures along the Nile River around 4,500 years ago was the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. The Old Kingdom is often referred to as the \"Age of the Pyramids\" due to the numerous pyramids built during this period, which served as tombs for pharaohs and their consorts. The most famous of these pyramids are the Great Pyramids of Giza, constructed for pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. The Sphinx, a monumental statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human, is also located near the Giza pyramids and is believed to have been built during the reign of pharaoh Khafre. These architectural marvels are testaments to the engineering skills and cultural achievements of the Ancient Egyptians during the Old Kingdom period."
