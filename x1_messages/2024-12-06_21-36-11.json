        "content": "Sure! To design a SQL query that retrieves information from an e-commerce database and produces a report showing each customer's total spending on each product category, we need to consider the structure of the database. Let's assume the following tables exist:\n\n1. **Customers**:\n   - customer_id (Primary Key)\n   - customer_name\n   - other relevant fields\n\n2. **Orders**:\n   - order_id (Primary Key)\n   - customer_id (Foreign Key referencing Customers)\n   - product_id (Foreign Key referencing Products)\n   - order_quantity\n   - order_price_per_unit\n   - other relevant fields\n\n3. **Products**:\n   - product_id (Primary Key)\n   - product_name\n   - category_id (Foreign Key referencing Categories)\n   - other relevant fields\n\n4. **Categories**:\n   - category_id (Primary Key)\n   - category_name\n   - other relevant fields\n\nOur goal is to produce a report that shows each customer's total spending on each product category. To achieve this, we need to join these tables appropriately and perform the necessary aggregations.\n\n### SQL Query\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    c.customer_id,\n    c.customer_name,\n    cat.category_id,\n    cat.category_name,\n    SUM(o.order_quantity * o.order_price_per_unit) AS total_spent\nFROM\n    Customers c\nJOIN\n    Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\nJOIN\n    Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id\nJOIN\n    Categories cat ON p.category_id = cat.category_id\nGROUP BY\n    c.customer_id,\n    c.customer_name,\n    cat.category_id,\n    cat.category_name\nORDER BY\n    c.customer_id,\n    cat.category_id;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Joins**:\n   - **Customers to Orders**: Link customers to their orders using `customer_id`.\n   - **Orders to Products**: Link orders to products using `product_id`.\n   - **Products to Categories**: Link products to their categories using `category_id`.\n\n2. **Aggregation**:\n   - Calculate the total spending per customer per category by multiplying the order quantity by the price per unit and summing these values.\n\n3. **Grouping**:\n   - Group the results by customer ID, customer name, category ID, and category name to get the total spending for each combination.\n\n4. **Ordering**:\n   - Order the results by customer ID and category ID for better readability.\n\nThis query will provide a detailed report showing how much each customer has spent on each product category, which can be useful for analytics and business decisions."
