        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection of two arrays efficiently without using built-in array methods or libraries, and ensuring a time complexity of O(n). Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have two arrays of integers.\n   - We need to find elements that are common to both arrays.\n   - The solution should not rely on built-in methods and should be efficient, with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n2. **Choose an Efficient Data Structure:**\n   - To achieve O(n) time complexity, we need a data structure that allows us to check for the existence of elements quickly.\n   - A Set in JavaScript would normally be ideal for this, but since we can't use built-in methods or libraries, we need a manual implementation.\n\n3. **Manual Implementation of a Set:**\n   - We can simulate a set using an object where keys represent the elements of the array, and values indicate their presence.\n   - This way, we can check for existence in O(1) time on average.\n\n4. **Algorithm Steps:**\n   - Create a set-like object for the first array.\n   - Iterate through the second array and check if each element exists in the set.\n   - If it does, add it to the result array.\n   - Ensure that each element in the result array is unique.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Arrays with no common elements.\n   - Arrays with duplicate elements.\n   - Empty arrays.\n\n6. **Implement the Function:**\n   - Initialize an object to simulate the set.\n   - Iterate through the first array and store each element as a key in the object.\n   - Iterate through the second array, and for each element, check if it exists in the object.\n   - If it does, add it to the result array and remove it from the object to avoid duplicates.\n\nHere is the JavaScript function that accomplishes this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction arrayIntersection(arr1, arr2) {\n    // Simulate a set using an object\n    const set = {};\n    const result = [];\n\n    // Add elements of the first array to the set\n    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {\n        const num = arr1[i];\n        set[num] = true;\n    }\n\n    // Check elements of the second array against the set\n    for (let i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {\n        const num = arr2[i];\n        if (set[num]) {\n            result.push(num);\n            // Remove the element to avoid duplicates\n            delete set[num];\n        }\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Set Simulation:**\n   - We use an object (`set`) to track the presence of elements from the first array.\n   - This allows us to check for existence in O(1) time.\n\n2. **Building the Result Array:**\n   - We iterate through the second array and check if each element exists in the `set`.\n   - If it does, we add it to the `result` array and remove it from the `set` to prevent duplicates.\n\n3. **Efficiency:**\n   - The time complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two arrays.\n   - Since we are required to have O(n) complexity, and n typically refers to the size of the input, this is acceptable.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the intersection efficiently without relying on built-in methods or libraries."
