        "content": "So you have a rectangular garden that's 15 feet by 20 feet, and you want to add a walkway around it that's 3 feet wide. You're trying to figure out what the new dimensions will be once you include the walkway.\n\nFirst, let's visualize this. Imagine your garden is a rectangle that's longer in one direction, say 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. Now, you want to add a walkway around it that's uniformly 3 feet wide all the way around.\n\nTo find the new dimensions, we need to account for the walkway on all sides of the garden. Since the walkway is 3 feet wide, it will add 3 feet to each side of the garden.\n\nBut wait, since it's around all sides, it will add 3 feet to both sides of the length and both sides of the width.\n\nSo, for the length:\n\nOriginal length = 20 feet\n\nWalkway on one end = 3 feet\n\nWalkway on the other end = 3 feet\n\nTotal addition to length = 3 + 3 = 6 feet\n\nTherefore, new length = original length + total addition = 20 + 6 = 26 feet\n\nSimilarly, for the width:\n\nOriginal width = 15 feet\n\nWalkway on one side = 3 feet\n\nWalkway on the other side = 3 feet\n\nTotal addition to width = 3 + 3 = 6 feet\n\nTherefore, new width = original width + total addition = 15 + 6 = 21 feet\n\nSo, the new dimensions of the entire area, including the walkway, would be 26 feet by 21 feet.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure we haven't missed anything.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the walkway forms a border around the garden, effectively increasing both the length and the width by twice the width of the walkway, since it's added on both sides.\n\nGiven that the walkway is 3 feet wide, twice that is 6 feet, which is what we added to both the length and the width.\n\nAlternatively, you could think of the entire area as a larger rectangle that encompasses both the garden and the walkway.\n\nIn this case, the larger rectangle's length would be the garden's length plus twice the walkway width, and similarly for the width.\n\nSo, length: 20 + 2*(3) = 20 + 6 = 26 feet\n\nWidth: 15 + 2*(3) = 15 + 6 = 21 feet\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the dimensions.\n\nFor example, does the walkway have a varying width or any irregular shapes? Based on your description, the walkway is uniformly 3 feet wide around the entire garden, so no, it's straightforward.\n\nAlso, are there any obstacles or features within the garden or walkway that might impact the dimensions? Again, based on what you've said, it's a simple rectangular garden with a uniform walkway around it.\n\nTherefore, the new dimensions should indeed be 26 feet by 21 feet.\n\nOne more thing to consider: if the walkway is only on one side of the garden or if it's partial, but in this case, it's around the entire garden, so it's added to all sides equally.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the new dimensions of the entire area, including the walkway, will be 26 feet in length and 21 feet in width.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26 \\text{ feet by } 21 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
