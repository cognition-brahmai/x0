        "content": "So the book club has 15 members, and each member reads 2 books per month. We want to find out how many books the entire club reads in a year. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many books one member reads in a year. Since each member reads 2 books per month, and there are 12 months in a year, one member would read:\n\n2 books/month * 12 months/year = 24 books/year\n\nNow, there are 15 members in the club, so to find the total number of books read by the entire club in a year, we multiply the number of books one member reads in a year by the number of members:\n\n24 books/year/member * 15 members = 360 books/year\n\nSo, the entire club reads 360 books in a year.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm our answer.\n\nAnother way is to first find out how many books the club reads in one month. Since each of the 15 members reads 2 books per month, the total number of books read in one month would be:\n\n15 members * 2 books/month/member = 30 books/month\n\nNow, to find out how many books are read in a year, we multiply the monthly total by 12:\n\n30 books/month * 12 months/year = 360 books/year\n\nOkay, that matches our previous calculation. So, it seems like 360 books per year is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we might have missed. For example, are there any holidays or months where members read more or less? The problem doesn't specify any variations, so we can assume that the reading rate is constant throughout the year.\n\nAlso, we're assuming that all members actively participate and read 2 books per month. If some members don't read that much, the total might be less, but based on the information given, we'll proceed with the assumption that all 15 members read 2 books each month.\n\nAnother angle to consider: perhaps some books are read by multiple members, but the problem doesn't indicate any overlap in reading, so we're assuming each book is read by one member.\n\nSo, sticking with our calculation, the club reads 360 books in a year.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If we imagine a grid with 15 rows (one for each member) and 12 columns (one for each month), each cell in the grid represents the 2 books read by that member in that month. So, total books would be 15 members * 12 months * 2 books/month.\n\nWait, that would be:\n\n15 * 12 * 2 = 15 * 24 = 360 books\n\nAgain, confirming our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, using dimensional analysis, we can set up the calculation as:\n\n15 members * 2 books/month/member * 12 months/year = 360 books/year\n\nThe units cancel out appropriately, leaving us with books per year.\n\nI think we've confirmed it sufficiently that the club reads 360 books in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
