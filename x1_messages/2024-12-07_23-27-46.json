        "content": "So John is renting a car from this company that charges a flat fee of $20 per day plus an additional $0.15 per mile driven. He's going to drive it for 100 miles. We need to figure out how much he'll be charged in total.\n\nFirst, let's break down the charges. There's a daily flat fee and a per-mile charge. But wait, the question doesn't specify how many days John is renting the car. It only mentions the daily flat fee, but doesn't say how many days he's renting it for. Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe it's just for one day? Or perhaps it's implied that it's per day, but he's only renting it for one day? I need to clarify that.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"A car rental company charges a flat fee of $20 per day plus an additional $0.15 per mile driven. If John rents a car and drives it for 100 miles, how much will he be charged?\"\n\nOkay, it says \"per day\" for the flat fee, but it doesn't specify how many days John rents the car. Maybe it's just for one day. Or perhaps the daily fee is applicable for each day he rents the car. But since it doesn't mention multiple days, I think it's safe to assume he's renting it for one day.\n\nSo, if he rents the car for one day and drives it for 100 miles, the total charge would be the daily flat fee plus the charge for the miles driven.\n\nLet's calculate the mile charge first. It's $0.15 per mile, and he drives 100 miles. So, 100 miles times $0.15 per mile would be:\n\n100 * 0.15 = $15\n\nSo, the mile charge is $15.\n\nNow, the daily flat fee is $20. Since he's renting it for one day, that's straightforward.\n\nSo, total charge would be:\n\nDaily fee + mile charge = $20 + $15 = $35\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are additional fees or something. But the question only mentions a flat fee per day and a per-mile charge. So, probably just these two components.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other possible charges. For example, sometimes car rental companies have charges for taxes, insurance, or other additives. However, the question doesn't mention any of these, so I think it's safe to assume that only the flat fee and the per-mile charge apply.\n\nAlso, we should consider if the car has to be returned with a full tank of gas or if there are drop-off fees, but again, the question doesn't mention any of these extraneous charges. So, I'll stick with the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the total amount John will be charged is $35.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, mile charge: 100 miles * $0.15/mile = $15\n\nDaily flat fee: $20\n\nTotal: $20 + $15 = $35\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the car is rented for more than one day, the flat fee would be multiplied by the number of days. But since the question doesn't specify multiple days, I'm assuming it's for one day only.\n\nSo, final answer: John will be charged $35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
