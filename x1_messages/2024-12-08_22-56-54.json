        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that sells two types of pens: blue and black. The ratio of blue pens to black pens is 3:2, and there are 250 pens in total. We need to find out how many more blue pens there are than black pens.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 3:2 for blue to black pens means that for every 3 blue pens, there are 2 black pens. So, the total number of parts in the ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, since there are 250 pens in total, each part of the ratio must represent a certain number of pens. To find out how many pens per part, I can divide the total number of pens by the total number of parts in the ratio.\n\nSo, pens per part = total pens / total parts = 250 / 5 = 50 pens per part.\n\nNow, since there are 3 parts of blue pens, the number of blue pens is 3 * 50 = 150.\n\nSimilarly, there are 2 parts of black pens, so the number of black pens is 2 * 50 = 100.\n\nNow, to find out how many more blue pens there are than black pens, I subtract the number of black pens from the number of blue pens: 150 - 100 = 50.\n\nSo, there are 50 more blue pens than black pens.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The ratio is 3:2, and the total is 250. Parts add up to 5, so each part is 50. Blue pens are 3 parts, so 150, black pens are 2 parts, so 100. Difference is 50. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of fractions. Since the ratio is 3:2, blue pens are 3/5 of the total, and black pens are 2/5 of the total.\n\nSo, blue pens = (3/5) * 250 = 150.\n\nBlack pens = (2/5) * 250 = 100.\n\nDifference is again 150 - 100 = 50.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 50.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this. Suppose I let the number of blue pens be 3x and the number of black pens be 2x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nThen, 3x + 2x = 250.\n\nCombining like terms, 5x = 250.\n\nSolving for x, x = 250 / 5 = 50.\n\nNow, blue pens = 3x = 3*50 = 150.\n\nBlack pens = 2x = 2*50 = 100.\n\nDifference is 150 - 100 = 50.\n\nAgain, the same answer. It seems no matter which method I use, I end up with 50 more blue pens than black pens.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if these numbers actually maintain the ratio.\n\nNumber of blue pens: 150.\n\nNumber of black pens: 100.\n\nRatio is 150:100, which simplifies to 3:2 when divided by 50. So, yes, that matches the given ratio.\n\nAlso, 150 + 100 = 250, which matches the total number of pens.\n\nTherefore, the answer is definitively 50.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The problem is straightforward once you understand how to work with ratios. I'm glad I could walk through it step by step and confirm the answer using multiple methods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
