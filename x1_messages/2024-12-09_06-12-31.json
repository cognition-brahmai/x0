        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have John and Mary, and John has twice as many apples as Mary. Together, they have 30 apples. We need to find out how many apples each person has.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being said. John has twice as many apples as Mary. That means if Mary has a certain number of apples, John has double that amount. And when you add both of their apples together, the total is 30.\n\nOkay, so maybe we can use some variables to represent the number of apples each has. Let's say Mary has M apples. Since John has twice as many as Mary, John would have 2M apples.\n\nNow, together they have 30 apples. So, if we add Mary's apples and John's apples, it should equal 30. That gives us the equation:\n\nM + 2M = 30\n\nCombining like terms, that's 3M = 30.\n\nTo find M, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\n3M / 3 = 30 / 3\n\nSo, M = 10\n\nTherefore, Mary has 10 apples. Since John has twice as many, John has 2 * 10 = 20 apples.\n\nLet's double-check that. If Mary has 10 apples and John has 20, together they have 10 + 20 = 30 apples, which matches the total given. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have approached this using ratios. Since John has twice as many apples as Mary, the ratio of John's apples to Mary's apples is 2:1. Together, that's 2 + 1 = 3 parts, and the total is 30 apples.\n\nSo, each part represents 30 / 3 = 10 apples.\n\nTherefore, Mary has 1 part, which is 10 apples, and John has 2 parts, which is 20 apples.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that Mary has some number of apples, and John has twice that. So, if Mary has M apples, John has 2M apples. Together, M + 2M = 30.\n\nAs we did earlier, that simplifies to 3M = 30, so M = 10.\n\nThis confirms our previous result.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The key is to translate the words into mathematical expressions and then solve the equations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Mary has } 10 \\text{ apples and John has } 20 \\text{ apples.}} \\]"
