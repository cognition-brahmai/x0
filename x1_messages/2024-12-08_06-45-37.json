solve this problem, we need to write a pantoum about the mysteries of the universe inspired by Walt Whitman. A pantoum is a type of poem where the lines are repeated in a specific pattern, creating a chain-like structure. This repetition creates a sense of continuity and echoes the themes throughout the poem.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understand Pantoum Structure**: \n   - A pantoum consists of quatrains (four-line stanzas).\n   - In each quatrain, the second and fourth lines are repeated as the first and third lines of the next quatrain.\n   - The last quatrain repeats the first and third lines of the first quatrain to create a circular structure.\n\n2. **Theme and Inspiration**:\n   - The theme is the mysteries of the universe, inspired by Walt Whitman's works, which often explore nature, humanity, and the cosmos.\n   - Incorporate elements of wonder, exploration, and the interconnectedness of all things, reflecting Whitman's style.\n\n3. **Line Repetition**:\n   - Ensure that the second and fourth
