        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If a car uses 6 liters of gas per 100 kilometers, how much gas does it use for a trip of 450 kilometers? And I need to show my work.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The car uses 6 liters of gas to travel 100 kilometers. I need to find out how much gas it uses for 450 kilometers.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how much gas the car uses per kilometer. That way, I can multiply that by 450 to get the total gas usage.\n\nSo, if 6 liters are used for 100 kilometers, then for 1 kilometer, it would use 6 liters divided by 100 kilometers. That is:\n\n6 liters / 100 km = 0.06 liters per kilometer.\n\nNow, for a 450-kilometer trip, I can multiply the gas used per kilometer by 450:\n\n0.06 liters/km * 450 km = 27 liters.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to approach this to double-check?\n\nMaybe I can set up a proportion. If 100 kilometers corresponds to 6 liters, then 450 kilometers corresponds to x liters.\n\nSo, 100 km : 6 liters = 450 km : x liters.\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n100/6 = 450/x\n\nWait, actually, that might not be correct. Let's see.\n\nActually, it should be:\n\n6 liters / 100 km = x liters / 450 km\n\nSo, 6/100 = x/450\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n6 * 450 = 100 * x\n\n2700 = 100x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 100:\n\nx = 2700 / 100 = 27 liters.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using multiplication factors.\n\nIf 100 kilometers use 6 liters, then for 450 kilometers, which is 4.5 times 100 kilometers, it should use 4.5 times 6 liters.\n\nSo, 4.5 * 6 = 27 liters.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, seems consistent. I can be confident that the answer is 27 liters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]"
