        "content": "What a fascinating riddle! I've been pondering over it, and I must say, it's quite intriguing. Let's see if I can unravel this mystery.\n\nSo, the riddle goes: \"You get many of me, but never enough. After the last one, your life soon will snuff. You may have one of me but one day a year, When the last one is gone, your life disappears.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key phrases here. \"You get many of me, but never enough\" suggests that whatever this thing is, it's something that people continually receive or possess, yet they always want more. \"After the last one, your life soon will snuff\" implies that there's a finite number of these things, and when you run out, it's the end of your life. Similarly, \"you may have one of me but one day a year\" suggests that in addition to having many over time, there's a special instance where you have just one, perhaps annually. And finally, \"when the last one is gone, your life disappears\" reiterates the idea that these things are crucial for survival.\n\nLet me consider some possibilities. Could it be something like breaths? We take many breaths, but we never have enough\u2014we always need more. And when our breaths run out, we die. But the part about \"one of me but one day a year\" doesn't seem to fit with breathing, as we breathe continuously, not just once a year.\n\nMaybe it's heartbeats. We have many heartbeats in our lives, but we can never have enough because our hearts keep beating until we die. However, again, the annual aspect doesn't make sense here.\n\nCould it be something related to time, like days or years? We have many days in our lives, but we never have enough time. And when our final day comes, our life ends. The annual aspect could be something like a birthday, where we get one each year. That seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's something more abstract, like chances or opportunities. We may have many chances in life, but we never feel like it's enough. When we've used up all our chances, maybe our life loses its purpose or meaning. But again, the annual aspect is unclear in this context.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's something that you receive or use up over time, with a specific annual event. Could it be something like candles on a birthday cake? Each year, you have one candle for each year of age, and on your birthday, you have one set of candles. But when you reach the end of your life, all the candles have been used up, so to speak. However, this doesn't entirely fit because having candles doesn't directly relate to the continuation of life.\n\nAnother angle: could it be something related to health or vitality? For example, units of health or life force. We have many units, but we never have enough because we're always using them up or needing more. When we use up the last unit, we die. The annual aspect might be a yearly check-up or a special health event once a year where you assess your health status. That could work, but it's a bit abstract.\n\nWait a minute, what about birthdays themselves? Each year, you have one birthday, which is a special day. Over your lifetime, you have many birthdays, but you never feel like you have enough\u2014you always look forward to the next one. And when your last birthday passes, your life is about to end, as you won't have another one. This seems to align well with the riddle.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against each line:\n\n1. \"You get many of me, but never enough.\" \u2014 You have many birthdays, but you always want more, to grow older.\n\n2. \"After the last one, your life soon will snuff.\" \u2014 After your final birthday, you won't have another, suggesting your life is coming to an end.\n\n3. \"You may have one of me but one day a year.\" \u2014 Each year, you have one birthday, which is a single day.\n\n4. \"When the last one is gone, your life disappears.\" \u2014 After the last birthday, life ends.\n\nThis seems to fit perfectly. Birthdays are something you have multiple times in your life, each year on your anniversary of birth. You can't have enough of them because each one marks another year of life, and people generally value longevity. The annual nature is inherent in birthdays, as they occur once a year. And indeed, after your last birthday, your life comes to an end, as there won't be another birthday to follow.\n\nI think this is the answer to the riddle: birthdays.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{birthdays}} \\]"
