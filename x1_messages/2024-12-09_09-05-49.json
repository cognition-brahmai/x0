        "content": "So there are 5 cats in a room, and each of these cats has 3 kittens. That means, first, we need to figure out how many kittens there are in total.\n\nIf each cat has 3 kittens, and there are 5 cats, then the total number of kittens would be 5 cats times 3 kittens per cat, which is 15 kittens.\n\nNow, adding the original 5 cats to the 15 kittens, there are a total of 5 + 15 = 20 cats in the room initially.\n\nEach cat, whether an adult or a kitten, has 4 legs. So, 20 cats times 4 legs per cat would be 80 legs in total.\n\nBut then, one of the kittens leaves the room. So, we need to subtract that one kitten and its 4 legs from the total.\n\nTherefore, 80 legs minus 4 legs for the kitten that left would be 76 legs remaining in the room.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that.\n\nWe have 5 adult cats and 15 kittens, making 20 cats total. Each has 4 legs, so 20 times 4 is indeed 80 legs.\n\nIf one kitten leaves, that's 4 legs less, so 80 minus 4 equals 76 legs remaining.\n\nHmm, but is there any other factor to consider? Are there any humans or other animals in the room? The question doesn't mention any, so perhaps it's just the cats and their kittens.\n\nAlso, the question specifies that each cat has 3 kittens. Does that mean that these are mother cats, and the kittens are their offspring? Probably, but that doesn't affect the leg count.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the kittens have all been born or are still unborn. But since the question says \"each cat has 3 kittens,\" it implies that the kittens exist and are present in the room.\n\nSo, sticking to the given information, we have 5 cats and 15 kittens, totaling 20 cats with 80 legs. One kitten leaves, subtracting 4 legs, leaving 76 legs in the room.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{76} \\]"
