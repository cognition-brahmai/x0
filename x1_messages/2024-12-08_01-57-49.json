        "content": "To calculate the amount of water that falls on the city each year in gallons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the area from square miles to square inches** because the rainfall is given in inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the total volume of rainfall in cubic inches**.\n\n3. **Convert the volume from cubic inches to gallons**.\n\nLet's start with the first step.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the area from square miles to square inches.**\n\nWe know that:\n\n- 1 mile = 5280 feet\n\n- 1 foot = 12 inches\n\nSo, 1 mile = 5280 * 12 = 63,360 inches\n\nTherefore, 1 square mile = (63,360 inches)^2 = 63,360 * 63,360 = 3,999,360,000 square inches\n\nGiven that the city's area is 100 square miles:\n\nArea in square inches = 100 * 3,999,360,000 = 399,936,000,000 square inches\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total volume of rainfall in cubic inches.**\n\nThe average annual rainfall is 40 inches. So, the volume of rainfall is the area multiplied by the rainfall depth.\n\nVolume = Area * Rainfall depth\n\nVolume = 399,936,000,000 square inches * 40 inches = 15,997,440,000,000 cubic inches\n\n**Step 3: Convert the volume from cubic inches to gallons.**\n\nWe need to know the conversion factor from cubic inches to gallons. The standard conversion is:\n\n1 gallon = 231 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the total volume in gallons is:\n\nTotal gallons = Volume in cubic inches / 231\n\nTotal gallons = 15,997,440,000,000 / 231 \u2248 69,253,419,913.42 gallons\n\nSo, approximately 69,253,419,913.42 gallons of water fall on the city each year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{69253419913.42} \\]"
