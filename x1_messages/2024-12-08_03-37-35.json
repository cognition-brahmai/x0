        "content": "I'm going to prove that the sum of the first n odd integers is equal to n\u00b2 using mathematical induction. So, let's get started.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what mathematical induction is. It's a method of proving statements that are indexed by natural numbers. It's like a domino effect: if I can show that the first domino falls and that each domino knocks over the next one, then all the dominoes will fall.\n\nSo, for this problem, the statement I'm trying to prove is that the sum of the first n odd integers equals n\u00b2. In mathematical terms, that's:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2\n\nAlright, step one is to state the base case. The base case is usually when n equals 1. So, let's check that.\n\nWhen n = 1, the first odd integer is 1, and 1\u00b2 is also 1. So, the base case holds true.\n\nNext, I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. This is called the induction hypothesis. So, I'll assume that:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to prove that if the statement is true for k, then it's also true for k + 1. In other words, I need to show that:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2\n\nLet me break that down. I already have the sum up to the kth odd integer, which is k\u00b2, according to my induction hypothesis. Now, I'm adding the next odd integer, which is 2(k + 1) - 1. Let's simplify that:\n\n2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1\n\nSo, I'm adding 2k + 1 to both sides of my induction hypothesis.\n\nSo, k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 should equal (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nLet's check that:\n\nk\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)\u00b2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, if the statement is true for k, it's also true for k + 1.\n\nNow, since I've shown that the base case is true, and that if it's true for k, it's true for k + 1, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let me double-check.\n\nI started with the base case n = 1, which holds true.\n\nThen, I assumed the statement is true for n = k, and proved that it implies the statement is true for n = k + 1.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me test it with another value of n.\n\nLet's say n = 3.\n\nThe first three odd integers are 1, 3, and 5.\n\nTheir sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is equal to 3\u00b2 = 9.\n\nLooks good.\n\nWhat about n = 4?\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4\u00b2.\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nI think this proof is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{n^2} \\]"
