        "content": "Let's see. So, the car travels at two different speeds for different periods of time, and I need to find out the total distance it covers. I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time, so maybe I can calculate the distance for each part of the trip separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, the car travels at 45 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance for this part should be 45 mph times 2 hours, which is 90 miles.\n\nThen, it increases its speed to 65 mph and travels for another 3 hours. So, the distance for this part should be 65 mph times 3 hours, which is 195 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together: 90 miles plus 195 miles, which equals 285 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider, like acceleration or something? But since the speeds are given as average speeds for each segment, I think it's okay to assume that's all I need.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire trip as one journey and see if there's another way to calculate the total distance, but I think breaking it down into parts is the straightforward approach.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations:\n\nFirst part: 45 mph * 2 hours = 90 miles.\n\nSecond part: 65 mph * 3 hours = 195 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 90 + 195 = 285 miles.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{285} \\]"
