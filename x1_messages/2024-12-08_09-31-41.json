        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python script that accepts a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the `n`th Fibonacci number using recursion.\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return \"Input should be a positive integer.\"\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\nprint(f\"The {n}th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci(n)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - The function `fibonacci(n)` is defined to calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number.\n   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it returns a message indicating that the input should be a positive integer.\n   - For `n` equal to 1, it returns 0 (since the first Fibonacci number is 0).\n   - For `n` equal to 2, it returns 1 (since the second Fibonacci number is 1).\n   - For `n` greater than 2, it recursively calls itself to get the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers.\n\n2. **Input and Output:**\n   - The script prompts the user to enter a positive integer.\n   - It reads the input, calculates the Fibonacci number using the `fibonacci` function, and prints the result.\n\nThis script efficiently calculates Fibonacci numbers using recursion, although it's worth noting that for large values of `n`, recursion might not be the most efficient approach due to repeated calculations. For such cases, iterative approaches or memoization techniques are recommended."
