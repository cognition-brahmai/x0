        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a square room with an area of 64 square feet, and I need to find out how long its diagonal is. Alright, let's start by recalling some properties of squares.\n\nFirst off, in a square, all sides are equal in length. So, if we can find the length of one side, we can easily find the diagonal because the diagonal of a square relates to its side length in a specific way.\n\nGiven that the area of the square is 64 square feet, and knowing that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one side (so area = side\u00b2), we can set up an equation to find the side length.\n\nLet's denote the side length as 's'. So, s\u00b2 = 64.\n\nTo find 's', we take the square root of both sides: s = \u221a64.\n\nThe square root of 64 is 8, so s = 8 feet.\n\nNow, to find the diagonal of the square. I remember that in a square, the diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with the two sides of the square. So, we can use the Pythagorean theorem here.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the diagonal of the square is the hypotenuse, and the two sides of the square are the other two sides of the triangle.\n\nSo, if we denote the diagonal as 'd', then according to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd\u00b2 = s\u00b2 + s\u00b2\n\nSince s = 8 feet, then:\n\nd\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = 64 + 64 = 128\n\nTherefore, d = \u221a128.\n\nNow, \u221a128 can be simplified. I know that 128 can be factored into 64 \u00d7 2, and since \u221a(64 \u00d7 2) = \u221a64 \u00d7 \u221a2 = 8\u221a2.\n\nSo, d = 8\u221a2 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? I recall that for squares, the relationship between the side length and the diagonal is always s\u221a2, where 's' is the side length.\n\nYes, that's another way to think about it. Since s = 8 feet, then d = 8\u221a2 feet, which matches what I found using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nJust to double-check, let's plug in the numbers again.\n\nIf s = 8 feet, then d = 8\u221a2 feet.\n\nI know that \u221a2 is approximately 1.414, so d \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.414 = 11.312 feet.\n\nLet me verify this by calculating it another way.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem again: d\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = 64 + 64 = 128, so d = \u221a128.\n\nCalculating \u221a128: well, 11\u00b2 = 121 and 12\u00b2 = 144, so \u221a128 should be between 11 and 12.\n\nLet's try 11.3: 11.3\u00b2 = 127.69, which is very close to 128.\n\nAlternatively, 11.31\u00b2 = 127.9161, and 11.32\u00b2 = 128.1424. So, 11.312\u00b2 would be approximately 128.\n\nTherefore, d \u2248 11.312 feet, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects an exact answer, I should leave it in terms of \u221a2, which is 8\u221a2 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a decimal approximation, I can provide that as well.\n\nHowever, unless specified, it's usually better to leave the answer in its exact form, which in this case is 8\u221a2 feet.\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't a different way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility that the room isn't a perfect square? The problem says \"square room,\" so I think it's safe to assume it's a square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area isn't 64 square feet, but the problem clearly states that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the units. The area is given in square feet, and we're asked for the length of the diagonal in feet, which is consistent.\n\nI don't think there are any tricks here; it's a straightforward problem once you recall the relationship between the side length and the diagonal of a square.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the room had been a rectangle instead of a square. In that case, we would need to know both the length and the width to find the diagonal. But since it's a square, all sides are equal, so it's straightforward.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 8\u221a2 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\sqrt{2}\\ \\text{feet}} \\]"
