        "content": "So there's this box with balls, right? 12 of them are red and 8 are blue. I need to find out the chance of picking a red ball if I grab one without looking. Okay, probability stuff.\n\nFirst, I remember that probability is basically the number of ways something can happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls.\n\nLet me count the total number of balls: 12 red plus 8 blue equals 20 balls in total.\n\nNow, the number of red balls is 12. So, the probability of picking a red ball should be 12 divided by 20.\n\nBut I can simplify that fraction. 12 divided by 20 is the same as 3 divided by 5, because both 12 and 20 can be divided by 4.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/5.\n\nWait, but probabilities are often expressed as decimals or percentages too, right? So, 3/5 is 0.6, which is 60%.\n\nMeaning, there's a 60% chance of picking a red ball.\n\nLet me double-check that. Total balls: 12 red + 8 blue = 20.\n\nProbability of red = number of red balls / total balls = 12/20 = 3/5 = 0.6 = 60%.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of chances. There are 12 chances to pick a red ball out of 20 possible picks, which again reduces to 3 in 5, or 60%.\n\nI don't think there's anything else complicating this problem. It seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other factor that might affect the probability, like whether the balls are arranged in a certain way or if picking one ball affects the others. But the problem says it's random and I'm picking without looking, so each ball has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nAlso, since I'm only picking one ball, not multiple, I don't need to worry about replacement or combinations or anything like that.\n\nSo, my final answer is 3/5, or 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
