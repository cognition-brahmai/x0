The total costs include both the fixed costs and the variable costs.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of widgets sold.\n\nThe cost to produce \\( x \\) widgets is the sum of the fixed costs and the variable costs. The variable cost is $5 per widget, and the fixed costs are $10,000 per month. So, the total cost (TC) is:\n\n\\[ TC = 5x + 10,000 \\]\n\nThe revenue from selling \\( x \\) widgets is the selling price per widget times the number of widgets sold. The selling price is $8 per widget. So, the total revenue (TR) is:\n\n\\[ TR = 8x \\]\n\nAt the break-even point, total revenue equals total cost:\n\n\\[ TR = TC \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for TR and TC:\n\n\\[ 8x = 5x + 10,000 \\]\n\nNow, we'll solve for \\( x \\):\n\nSubtract \\( 5x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 8x - 5x = 10,000 \\]\n\n\\[ 3x = 10,000 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{10,000}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx 3,333.33 \\]\n\nSince the factory can't sell a fraction of a widget, they need to sell at least 3,334 widgets to cover their costs.\n\nSo, the factory must sell 3,334 widgets each month to break even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3334} \\]"
