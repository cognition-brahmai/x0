        "content": "The architectural style commonly associated with flat roofs, open floor plans, and large windows is E) Mid-Century Modern.\n\nMid-Century Modern architecture emerged in the mid-20th century, roughly between the 1930s and 1960s. This style was a reaction against the ornamentation of earlier architectural movements and focused on clean lines, simplicity, and functionality. Key characteristics include:\n\n1. **Flat Roofs**: Many Mid-Century Modern buildings feature flat or low-sloped roofs, which were seen as more modern and in line with the International Style.\n\n2. **Open Floor Plans**: Interior spaces are often open and flowing, minimizing the use of walls to create a sense of spaciousness and connection between different areas of the home.\n\n3. **Large Windows**: Expansive windows, often floor-to-ceiling, allow for ample natural light and blur the distinction between indoor and outdoor spaces.\n\nOther features of Mid-Century Modern architecture include the use of materials like steel, glass, and concrete, as well as an emphasis on integrating the building with its natural surroundings.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n- **Baroque** (Option A) is known for its grandeur, ornamentation, and dramatic use of light and shadow. It emerged in the 17th century and is characterized by curved forms, rich detail, and a sense of movement.\n\n- **Byzantine** (Option B) architecture, dating from the 5th to the 15th century, is noted for its domes, vaulted ceilings, and intricate mosaics. It often features a central plan and extensive use of decorative elements.\n\n- **Rococo** (Option C) is a highly decorative and elaborate style that succeeded the Baroque in the early 18th century. It is characterized by asymmetry, pastel colors, and intricate, delicate ornamentation.\n\n- **Tudor Revival** (Option D) is a style that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, inspired by medieval Tudor architecture. It features steeply pitched roofs, half-timbering, and large chimneys.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E) Mid-Century Modern."
