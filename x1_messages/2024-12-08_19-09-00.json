        "content": "Let's see. I have a bag with 3 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, the total number of balls is 3 + 4 + 5, which is 12 balls.\n\nI need to find the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball without replacement. That means once I draw the first ball, I don't put it back into the bag before drawing the second ball.\n\nOkay, so for the first draw, the probability of drawing a red ball. There are 3 red balls out of 12 total balls, so the probability is 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\nNow, since I'm not replacing the first ball, the total number of balls left in the bag is 11. And since I drew a red ball first, there are still 4 blue balls left.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a blue ball second, given that the first ball drawn was red, is 4/11.\n\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014first drawing a red ball and then a blue ball\u2014I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the overall probability is (1/4) * (4/11).\n\nLet me calculate that: (1/4) * (4/11) = (1 * 4) / (4 * 11) = 4 / 44 = 1/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball without replacement is 1/11.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 12 without replacement is C(12,2), which is 12 choose 2.\n\nC(12,2) = 12! / (2! * (12-2)!) = (12*11)/2 = 66.\n\nThe number of ways to draw a red ball first and then a blue ball is the number of red balls times the number of blue balls, which is 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nSo, the probability should be 12 / 66 = 2/11.\n\nWait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me see where I went wrong.\n\nOh, I think I made a mistake in my first approach.\n\nWhen I multiplied (3/12) * (4/11), that is correct, but 3/12 is 1/4, and 1/4 * 4/11 is indeed 1/11.\n\nBut according to the combination approach, it's 12/66 = 2/11.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the order matters in the first approach, but in the combination approach, it's without regard to order.\n\nWait, no. In the combination approach, C(12,2) is for unordered pairs, but since we're interested in a specific order\u2014first red, then blue\u2014I think I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as permutations.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls in order is P(12,2), which is 12 * 11 = 132.\n\nThe number of ways to draw a red ball first and then a blue ball is 3 (red) * 4 (blue) = 12.\n\nSo, the probability is 12 / 132 = 1/11.\n\nThat matches my first calculation.\n\nSo, why did the combination approach give a different answer?\n\nOh, I see. In the combination approach, C(12,2) = 66, and the number of ways to choose one red and one blue ball is C(3,1) * C(4,1) = 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nBut since combinations don't consider order, this 12 includes both red then blue and blue then red.\n\nSo, to find the probability of red then blue specifically, I need to divide by 2, because half of those combinations would be red then blue, and half would be blue then red.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes for red then blue is 12 / 2 = 6.\n\nSo, the probability is 6 / 66 = 1/11.\n\nNow, this matches my first calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability is 1/11.\n\nI was confused because I mixed up the ordered and unordered approaches, but in the end, both methods should give the same result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{11}} \\]"
