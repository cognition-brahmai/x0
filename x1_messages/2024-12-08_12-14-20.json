        "content": "In Biomedical Engineering, the primary purpose of a pacemaker is to regulate the heart's electrical system. So, the correct answer is D. To regulate the heart's electrical system.\n\nTo provide some more details, a pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It's often used in patients who have arrhythmias, which are irregular or abnormal heartbeats.\n\nOption A, to regulate blood pressure, is not the primary purpose of a pacemaker. Blood pressure regulation is managed by other systems and devices in the body and in medicine.\n\nOption B, to monitor heart rate, is partially correct in that pacemakers can monitor heart rate, but their primary function is to regulate it by delivering electrical impulses when necessary.\n\nOption C, to stimulate bone growth, is incorrect. Pacemakers are designed for cardiac functions and do not affect bone growth.\n\nOption E, all of the above, is also incorrect because not all the options are correct purposes of a pacemaker.\n\nSo, in summary, while pacemakers can monitor heart activity, their main function is to regulate the heart's electrical system to maintain a proper heart rhythm."
