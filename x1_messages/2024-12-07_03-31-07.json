The expression is:\n\n((4^2 - 9) / 7) + 6 * (3 - 1)^2\n\nFirst, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, I'll start with the innermost parentheses.\n\nFirst, calculate 4^2:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow, subtract 9 from that:\n\n16 - 9 = 7\n\nSo, the expression now is:\n\n(7 / 7) + 6 * (3 - 1)^2\n\nNext, calculate 3 - 1:\n\n3 - 1 = 2\n\nSo now it's:\n\n(7 / 7) + 6 * (2)^2\n\nThen, calculate 2 squared:\n\n2^2 = 4\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(7 / 7) + 6 * 4\n\nNext, do the division and multiplication from left to right.\n\n7 / 7 = 1\n\nThen, 6 * 4 = 24\n\nSo now it's:\n\n1 + 24\n\nFinally, add those together:\n\n1 + 24 = 25\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
