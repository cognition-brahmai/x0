        "content": "Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\\frac{2x - 5}{3} + 4 = 7\\]\n\nFirst, I need to isolate the term with the variable \\(x\\). To do that, I can start by getting rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term on the left is +4. So, I'll subtract 4 from both sides to keep the equation balanced.\n\n\\[\\frac{2x - 5}{3} + 4 - 4 = 7 - 4\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[\\frac{2x - 5}{3} = 3\\]\n\nNow, I need to eliminate the denominator, which is 3. To do that, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 3.\n\n\\[3 \\times \\frac{2x - 5}{3} = 3 \\times 3\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[2x - 5 = 9\\]\n\nNext, I need to isolate the term with \\(x\\). There's a -5 on the left side, so I'll add 5 to both sides to eliminate it.\n\n\\[2x - 5 + 5 = 9 + 5\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[2x = 14\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2.\n\n\\[\\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{14}{2}\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[x = 7\\]\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is \\(x = 7\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
