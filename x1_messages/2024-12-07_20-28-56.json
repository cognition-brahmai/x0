        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. You're picking one ball, putting it back, and then picking another ball. You want to know the probability of picking two red balls in a row.\n\nFirst, since you're putting the ball back each time, each pick is independent. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first try is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So that's 5 red balls out of 8 total balls, which is 5/8.\n\nSince you're putting the ball back, the total number of balls remains the same for the second pick. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second try is also 5/8.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening in sequence (picking a red ball and then another red ball), you multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two red balls in a row is (5/8) * (5/8).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n5/8 is 0.625.\n\n0.625 multiplied by 0.625 is 0.390625.\n\nTo express that as a fraction, it's (5/8)^2, which is 25/64.\n\nSo, the probability is 25/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{64}} \\]"
