The script provides options to list all running services, stop a service, start a service, and restart a service.\n\n```powershell\n# Function to list all running services\nfunction List-RunningServices {\n    Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Running' } | Format-Table Name, DisplayName, Status\n}\n\n# Function to stop a service\nfunction Stop-ServiceByName {\n    param (\n        [string]$ServiceName\n    )\n    try {\n        $service = Get-Service -Name $ServiceName -ErrorAction Stop\n        if ($service.Status -eq 'Running') {\n            Stop-Service -Name $ServiceName -Force\n            Write-Host \"Service '$ServiceName' has been stopped.\"\n        } else {\n            Write-Host \"Service '$ServiceName' is not running.\"\n        }\n    } catch {\n        Write-Host \"Error: $_\"\n    }\n}\n\n# Function to start a service\nfunction Start-ServiceByName {\n    param (\n        [string]$ServiceName\n    )\n    try {\n        $service = Get-Service -Name $ServiceName -ErrorAction Stop\n        if ($service.Status -eq 'Stopped') {\n            Start-Service -Name $ServiceName\n            Write-Host \"Service '$ServiceName' has been started.\"\n        } else {\n            Write-Host \"Service '$ServiceName' is already running.\"\n        }\n    } catch {\n        Write-Host \"Error: $_\"\n    }\n}\n\n# Function to restart a service\nfunction Restart-ServiceByName {\n    param (\n        [string]$ServiceName\n    )\n    try {\n        $service = Get-Service -Name $ServiceName -ErrorAction Stop\n        if ($service.Status -eq 'Running') {\n            Restart-Service -Name $ServiceName -Force\n            Write-Host \"Service '$ServiceName' has been restarted.\"\n        } else {\n            Write-Host \"Service '$ServiceName' is not running.\"\n        }\n    } catch {\n        Write-Host \"Error: $_\"\n    }\n}\n\n# Main script\n$choice = $null\n\nwhile ($choice -ne 'q') {\n    Write-Host \"Options:\"\n    Write-Host \"1: List all running services\"\n    Write-Host \"2: Stop a service\"\n    Write-Host \"3: Start a service\"\n    Write-Host \"4: Restart a service\"\n    Write-Host \"q: Quit\"\n\n    $choice = Read-Host \"Enter your choice\"\n\n    switch ($choice) {\n        '1' {\n            List-RunningServices\n        }\n        '2' {\n            $serviceName = Read-Host \"Enter the name of the service to stop\"\n            Stop-ServiceByName -ServiceName $serviceName\n        }\n        '3' {\n            $serviceName = Read-Host \"Enter the name of the service to start\"\n            Start-ServiceByName -ServiceName $serviceName\n        }\n        '4' {\n            $serviceName = Read-Host \"Enter the name of the service to restart\"\n            Restart-ServiceByName -ServiceName $serviceName\n        }\n        'q' {\n            Write-Host \"Exiting...\"\n        }\n        default {\n            Write-Host \"Invalid choice.
