It's a popular instrument in jazz music, and it does have keys that open and close holes on a metal tube, which alters the pitch of the sound produced. The saxophone comes in various sizes, such as soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone, each with its own unique tone and range. Jazz musicians often use the saxophone to play melodic lines and solos, contributing to the expressive and improvisational nature of the genre."
