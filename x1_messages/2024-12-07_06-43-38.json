        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a group of people, and their eye colors are divided like this: 60% have brown eyes, 40% have blue eyes, and 10% have green eyes. Now, I need to find out the probability that if I pick one person at random, they have either brown or green eyes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Probability is about finding the chances of something happening. In this case, it's the chance that the person I pick has either brown or green eyes.\n\nI know that the total probability for all possible outcomes should add up to 100%, or 1, because someone has to have eyes of one color, assuming these are the only colors in the group.\n\nSo, here's what I have:\n\n- Brown eyes: 60%\n\n- Blue eyes: 40%\n\n- Green eyes: 10%\n\nWait a minute, if I add these up: 60% + 40% + 10% = 110%. That's over 100%! How is that possible? Probably, there's an error here because probabilities shouldn't exceed 100%.\n\nMaybe someone can have more than one eye color, or perhaps there's overlapping categories, but that seems unlikely. Perhaps the percentages aren't mutually exclusive, meaning some people have multiple eye colors or there's a mistake in the given percentages.\n\nAssuming that's not the case, and it's just a mistake in the problem, I might need to adjust the figures. Maybe the green eyes include some part of the brown or blue, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the green eyes are a subset of brown or blue, but that doesn't make much biological sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the percentages are incorrect, and the green eyes are separate from brown and blue.\n\nWait, perhaps the green eyes are in addition to the brown and blue, making the total more than 100%, which wouldn't make sense.\n\nI think the most likely scenario is that there's an error in the problem, and the percentages don't add up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blue eyes include some part of the green eyes, or something like that.\n\nBut for the sake of solving the problem, I'll assume that some people have multiple eye colors, and that's why the percentages add up to more than 100%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the green eyes are a separate group outside of brown and blue.\n\nWait, perhaps the brown, blue, and green eyes aren't the only categories, and there are others not mentioned.\n\nBut the problem says these are the only percentages given.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should just proceed by adding the probabilities of brown and green eyes, ignoring the total being over 100%.\n\nSo, if I add the probability of brown eyes and green eyes: 60% + 10% = 70%.\n\nBut, because the total is 110%, that might mean that 10% have both brown and green eyes, which isn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the green eyes are included in the brown eyes, but again, that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the green eyes are a separate group, and some people have neither brown nor blue eyes, but green eyes.\n\nBut then, the percentages still add up to more than 100%, which shouldn't happen.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that 60% have brown eyes, 40% have blue eyes, and out of those, 10% have green eyes.\n\nBut that still doesn't resolve the issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the green eyes are a separate category excluding brown and blue, but then the total would be 60% brown, 40% blue, and 10% green, totaling 110%.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentages are not mutually exclusive, meaning some people have multiple eye colors.\n\nIn that case, to find the probability of having either brown or green eyes, I would use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe formula for the union of two events is:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nIn this case, A is having brown eyes, and B is having green eyes.\n\nSo, P(brown or green) = P(brown) + P(green) - P(brown and green)\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide P(brown and green), so I can't calculate it directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that eye colors are mutually exclusive, meaning someone can't have both brown and green eyes.\n\nIn that case, P(brown and green) = 0, and P(brown or green) = 60% + 10% = 70%.\n\nBut then the total would be 70% brown or green, and 40% blue, totaling 110%, which is still problematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blue eyes include some part of the green eyes, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis seems like a flawed problem, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the green eyes are a mix of brown and blue eyes, but again, that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to simply add the percentages for brown and green eyes, ignoring the total exceeding 100%.\n\nIn that case, P(brown or green) = 60% + 10% = 70%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that 60% have brown eyes, 40% have blue eyes, and 10% have green eyes, with some overlap.\n\nIn that case, without knowing the overlap, I can't determine the exact probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that only brown and blue eyes are possible, and green eyes are a separate category, but again, that leads to a total of 110%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo, and the percentages are meant to add up to 100%.\n\nFor example, maybe it's 50% brown, 40% blue, and 10% green, totaling 100%.\n\nBut as per the problem, it's 60% brown, 40% blue, and 10% green.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in percentages larger than 100%, implying multiple counts.\n\nBut that seems too advanced for a basic probability problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group includes people with multiple eye colors, like both brown and green, but biologically, that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as having a Venn diagram with overlapping categories.\n\nIn that case, without knowing the overlaps, I can't determine the exact probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that eye colors are mutually exclusive, even though the percentages add up to more than 100%.\n\nIn that case, P(brown or green) = 60% + 10% = 70%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me by giving impossible percentages, and the answer is that the problem is flawed.\n\nBut I think the expectation is to proceed with the given numbers, assuming mutual exclusivity despite the total exceeding 100%.\n\nIn that case, the probability of selecting someone with either brown or green eyes is 70%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blue eyes include the green eyes, meaning that 40% have blue eyes, and 10% of those have green eyes.\n\nBut that would make the green eyes a subset of blue eyes, which doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the green eyes are a separate category outside of brown and blue.\n\nIn that case, P(brown or green) = P(brown) + P(green) - P(brown and green)\n\nBut without knowing P(brown and green), I can't calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that no one has both brown and green eyes, so P(brown and green) = 0.\n\nIn that case, P(brown or green) = 60% + 10% = 70%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to recognize that the total is over 100% and conclude that some people have multiple eye colors.\n\nIn that case, P(brown or green) would be less than 70%, depending on the overlap.\n\nBut without knowing the overlap, I can't determine the exact probability.\n\nGiven all this confusion, I think the simplest approach is to assume mutual exclusivity and add the probabilities of brown and green eyes, resulting in 70%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected person has either brown or green eyes is 70%, or 0.7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.7} \\]"
