        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a hospital emergency room dealing with 600 patients a day. These patients are categorized into three groups based on their needs: immediate attention, urgent care, and non-urgent issues. The breakdown is 70% needing immediate attention, 20% needing urgent care, and 10% with non-urgent issues.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many patients fall into each category.\n\nTotal patients per day: 600\n\nImmediate attention: 70% of 600 = 0.70 * 600 = 420 patients\n\nUrgent care: 20% of 600 = 0.20 * 600 = 120 patients\n\nNon-urgent: 10% of 600 = 0.10 * 600 = 60 patients\n\nSo, we have 420 patients needing immediate attention, 120 needing urgent care, and 60 with non-urgent issues.\n\nNow, the hospital has 50 doctors in the ER, and each doctor can treat 12 patients per shift. I need to find out how many shifts per doctor are required to handle this patient load.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total patient load:\n\nTotal patients = 420 + 120 + 60 = 600 patients\n\nEach doctor can treat 12 patients per shift, and there are 50 doctors.\n\nTotal patients treated per shift = 50 doctors * 12 patients/doctor = 600 patients/shift\n\nWait a minute, that's exactly the total number of patients per day: 600.\n\nSo, if the hospital operates with one shift per day, and all 50 doctors work that one shift, they can treat all 600 patients in that single shift.\n\nBut perhaps the hospital operates with multiple shifts per day. Let's consider that.\n\nAssuming a 24-hour day, if they have, say, three 8-hour shifts, then each doctor would work one of those shifts.\n\nIn that case, the number of shifts per doctor per day would be 1, assuming they work one shift per day.\n\nBut perhaps some doctors work more shifts. Let's generalize.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\ns = number of shifts per doctor per day\n\nThen, total doctor shifts per day = 50 doctors * s shifts/doctor = 50s shifts per day\n\nEach shift treats 12 patients, so total patients treated per day = 50s * 12 = 600s patients per day\n\nBut the patient load is 600 patients per day, so:\n\n600s = 600\n\ns = 1\n\nSo, each doctor needs to work 1 shift per day to handle the patient load, assuming the shifts are arranged such that the total doctor shifts per day meet the patient load.\n\nBut maybe the hospital has a certain number of shifts defined. Let\u2019s consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hospital has set shift lengths, and I need to determine how many shifts are needed.\n\nLet\u2019s assume a standard day has 24 hours.\n\nIf each shift is, say, 8 hours, then there would be 24 / 8 = 3 shifts per day.\n\nIf each doctor works one shift per day, then total doctor shifts per day = 50 doctors * 1 shift/doctor = 50 shifts per day\n\nEach shift treats 12 patients, so total patients treated per day = 50 shifts * 12 patients/shift = 600 patients/day\n\nWhich matches the patient load of 600 per day.\n\nSo, in this scenario, with 50 doctors each working one 8-hour shift per day, they can handle the 600 patients per day.\n\nBut perhaps the shifts overlap or are of different lengths. Let's consider that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some doctors work longer shifts or multiple shifts.\n\nBut based on the information given, with 50 doctors each working one shift per day totaling 50 shifts per day, each treating 12 patients, they can handle the 600 patients per day.\n\nNow, the next part is to estimate the waiting time for each category of patients based on this staffing plan.\n\nTo estimate waiting times, I need to consider how the patients are prioritized and how the doctors allocate their time among the different categories.\n\nGiven that there are three categories: immediate, urgent, and non-urgent, it's likely that doctors prioritize treating patients who need immediate attention first, then those who need urgent care, and finally those with non-urgent issues.\n\nAssuming that doctors treat patients in order of priority, I can model the waiting times based on the arrival rates and the service rates.\n\nFirst, let's assume that patients arrive uniformly throughout the shift.\n\nLet\u2019s assume each shift is 8 hours long.\n\nTotal time per shift = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes\n\nEach doctor treats 12 patients per shift, so the treatment time per patient is:\n\nTreatment time per patient = 480 minutes / 12 patients = 40 minutes per patient\n\nSo, each doctor spends 40 minutes per patient.\n\nNow, considering the prioritization:\n\n1. Immediate attention patients are treated first.\n\n2. Then urgent care patients.\n\n3. Finally, non-urgent patients.\n\nGiven that, the waiting time for each category will depend on the number of patients in higher priority categories ahead of them.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the total number of patients in each category that need to be treated.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nImmediate: 420 patients\n\nUrgent: 120 patients\n\nNon-urgent: 60 patients\n\nNow, with 50 doctors each treating 12 patients per shift, total patients treated per shift is 50 * 12 = 600, which matches the daily patient load.\n\nBut to find waiting times, I need to consider the flow within the shift.\n\nAssuming patients arrive uniformly throughout the shift, and doctors treat patients in order of priority.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the arrival rate per minute.\n\nTotal patients per shift: 600\n\nTotal time per shift: 480 minutes\n\nArrival rate: 600 patients / 480 minutes = 1.25 patients per minute\n\nBut more precisely, since there are three categories, I can find the arrival rates for each category.\n\nImmediate: 420 patients / 480 minutes = 0.875 patients per minute\n\nUrgent: 120 patients / 480 minutes = 0.25 patients per minute\n\nNon-urgent: 60 patients / 480 minutes = 0.125 patients per minute\n\nNow, each doctor has a service rate of 1 patient every 40 minutes.\n\nSo, service rate per doctor: 1/40 patients per minute\n\nWith 50 doctors, total service rate: 50 * (1/40) = 1.25 patients per minute\n\nWhich matches the overall arrival rate of 1.25 patients per minute.\n\nThis suggests that, in steady state, the system can handle the load without a growing queue.\n\nNow, to find the waiting time for each category, I need to consider the queueing discipline, which in this case is priority-based.\n\nIn priority queueing systems, higher priority patients are served before lower priority ones.\n\nSo, for immediate patients, their waiting time depends only on the number of immediate patients ahead of them.\n\nFor urgent patients, their waiting time depends on the number of immediate patients ahead of them and the service time for those immediate patients.\n\nSimilarly, for non-urgent patients, their waiting time depends on the number of immediate and urgent patients ahead of them.\n\nThis can get quite complex to model exactly, but I can make some simplifying assumptions to estimate the waiting times.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the doctors treat patients in order of priority, and that patients arrive uniformly throughout the shift.\n\nUnder these assumptions, I can model the waiting time for each category based on the workload for higher priority patients.\n\nFirst, let's find the total patient load for each priority:\n\nImmediate: 420 patients\n\nUrgent: 120 patients\n\nNon-urgent: 60 patients\n\nTotal: 600 patients\n\nNow, the total service capacity is 50 doctors * 12 patients/doctor = 600 patients, which matches the patient load.\n\nBut to find waiting times, I need to look at the system more dynamically.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of Little's Law, which relates waiting time, arrival rate, and queue length.\n\nLittle's Law: W = L / \u03bb\n\nWhere W is waiting time, L is average queue length, and \u03bb is arrival rate.\n\nBut in a priority system, applying Little's Law directly to each class is tricky because the service to one class affects the waiting times of other classes.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of effective arrival rates and service rates for each priority class.\n\nBut this might be too involved for our purposes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the system in stages.\n\nFirst, all immediate patients are treated first.\n\nThen, urgent patients are treated next.\n\nFinally, non-urgent patients are treated last.\n\nGiven that, I can estimate the time spent treating each category.\n\nTotal time per shift: 480 minutes\n\nTime spent treating immediate patients:\n\nNumber of immediate patients: 420\n\nService time per patient: 40 minutes\n\nTotal time for immediate patients: 420 * 40 = 16,800 minutes\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total time per shift is only 480 minutes.\n\nThis suggests that there's a bottleneck here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWith 50 doctors, each treating 12 patients per shift, the total treatment time available is:\n\n50 doctors * 40 minutes per patient = 2,000 minutes of treatment time per shift\n\nBut the total treatment time required is:\n\n420 immediate * 40 minutes = 16,800 minutes\n\n120 urgent * 40 minutes = 4,800 minutes\n\n60 non-urgent * 40 minutes = 2,400 minutes\n\nTotal required treatment time: 16,800 + 4,800 + 2,400 = 24,000 minutes\n\nBut the available treatment time is only 2,000 minutes per shift.\n\nThis doesn't add up.\n\nWait, there must be a mistake here.\n\nEarlier, I calculated that each doctor can treat 12 patients per shift, and with 50 doctors, that's 600 patients per shift, which matches the daily patient load.\n\nBut now, calculating the total treatment time required:\n\n420 immediate * 40 minutes = 16,800 minutes\n\n120 urgent * 40 minutes = 4,800 minutes\n\n60 non-urgent * 40 minutes = 2,400 minutes\n\nTotal required treatment time: 24,000 minutes\n\nBut with 50 doctors, each providing 40 minutes per patient * 12 patients = 4800 minutes per doctor per shift.\n\nWait, no, each doctor treats 12 patients, each taking 40 minutes, so total treatment time per doctor per shift is indeed 12 * 40 = 480 minutes, but that's not possible because a shift is only 480 minutes long.\n\nWait, this is inconsistent.\n\nIf each doctor treats 12 patients in a 480-minute shift, with each patient taking 40 minutes, that would require:\n\n12 patients * 40 minutes = 480 minutes, which matches the shift length.\n\nBut then, total treatment time provided is 50 doctors * 480 minutes = 24,000 minutes, which matches the total required treatment time of 24,000 minutes.\n\nSo, in theory, it balances out.\n\nBut now, considering the priority scheduling:\n\nDoctors treat immediate patients first, then urgent, then non-urgent.\n\nGiven that, the waiting time for each patient depends on the number of higher priority patients ahead of them and the service times.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the treatment process:\n\n- First, all immediate patients are treated.\n\n- Then, all urgent patients are treated.\n\n- Finally, all non-urgent patients are treated.\n\nGiven that, the waiting time for each category can be estimated as follows:\n\n1. Immediate patients:\n\n- No waiting time, as they are treated first.\n\n- However, since doctors are treating patients in order, and patients arrive uniformly throughout the shift, there might still be some waiting time due to the arrival pattern.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume that immediate patients have zero waiting time on average, as they are given top priority.\n\n2. Urgent patients:\n\n- Wait until all immediate patients have been treated.\n\n- The time to treat all immediate patients is:\n\nNumber of immediate patients: 420\n\nTotal treatment time for immediate patients: 420 * 40 = 16,800 minutes\n\nBut with 50 doctors treating simultaneously, the time to treat all immediate patients is:\n\nTotal treatment time for immediate patients / number of doctors = 16,800 / 50 = 336 minutes\n\nSo, urgent patients start being treated after 336 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the waiting time for urgent patients is 336 minutes.\n\nHowever, during these 336 minutes, urgent patients are arriving.\n\nSince patients arrive uniformly throughout the shift, urgent patients are arriving at a rate of 0.25 patients per minute.\n\nThe waiting time for urgent patients would be the time to treat all immediate patients, minus the time they arrived during that period.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the waiting time for urgent patients as the time to treat all immediate patients that arrived before them.\n\nGiven that patients arrive uniformly, the average urgent patient arrives halfway through the shift, but the treatment of immediate patients takes 336 minutes.\n\nSo, the waiting time for urgent patients would be approximately 336 minutes minus the time they arrived.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the waiting time for urgent patients is the time to treat the immediate patients that arrived before their arrival time.\n\nThis would require a more detailed queueing model, which might be beyond the scope here.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that the waiting time for urgent patients is approximately the time to treat half of the immediate patients, assuming arrivals are uniform.\n\nSo, waiting time for urgent patients: approximately 336 / 2 = 168 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, for non-urgent patients:\n\n- They wait until all immediate and urgent patients have been treated.\n\n- Time to treat urgent patients: number of urgent patients * service time / number of doctors = 120 * 40 / 50 = 96 minutes\n\n- Therefore, total waiting time for non-urgent patients: time to treat immediate patients (336 minutes) + time to treat urgent patients (96 minutes) = 432 minutes\n\nAgain, this is a simplification, as patients arrive uniformly during the shift.\n\nThis waiting time doesn't account for the arrivals of non-urgent patients during this period.\n\nBut for the sake of this exercise, let's proceed with these estimates.\n\nSo, estimated waiting times:\n\n- Immediate patients: 0 minutes (priority treatment)\n\n- Urgent patients: approximately 168 minutes\n\n- Non-urgent patients: approximately 432 minutes\n\nThese waiting times seem quite long, especially for non-urgent patients (7.2 hours), which is longer than the shift length. This suggests that there might be an issue with the current staffing plan or patient categorization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption that all immediate patients are treated first, then urgent, then non-urgent, leading to such long waiting times for lower priority patients, indicates that the hospital needs to reconsider its staffing or patient flow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe doctors are supposed to balance treating patients from all categories simultaneously, rather than treating one category completely before moving to the next.\n\nIf doctors are allowed to switch between categories, giving higher priority to urgent cases but also attending to some lower priority cases, the waiting times might be reduced.\n\nHowever, based on the initial instruction to treat immediate patients first, then urgent, then non-urgent, the estimated waiting times are as above.\n\nGiven these long waiting times, especially for non-urgent patients, the hospital might need to consider increasing the number of doctors or adjusting the patient categorization to reduce waiting times.\n\nAlternatively, they could implement a system where doctors are allocated specific times or capacities for each priority level, rather than treating one category completely before moving to the next.\n\nThis could help in reducing the waiting times for urgent and non-urgent patients.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the current staffing plan and priority treatment approach, the estimated waiting times are:\n\n- Immediate patients: 0 minutes\n\n- Urgent patients: approximately 168 minutes\n\n- Non-urgent patients: approximately 432 minutes\n\nThese estimates assume that doctors treat all immediate patients before moving on to urgent and then non-urgent patients, and that patients arrive uniformly throughout the shift.\n\nGiven the long waiting times, especially for non-urgent patients, the hospital should consider adjusting its patient flow or increasing staffing levels to improve waiting times for all patient categories.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\text{Required number of shifts per doctor: 1 shift per day} } \\]\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\text{Estimated waiting times: Immediate - 0 minutes, Urgent - 168 minutes, Non-urgent - 432 minutes} } \\]"
