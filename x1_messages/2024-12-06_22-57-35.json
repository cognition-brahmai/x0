        "content": "I think I've heard about this before. So, there's a European country whose capital is called the \"City of a Hundred Spires\" because it has lots of old churches with spires. I'm trying to remember which one it is.\n\nI know that many European cities have lots of churches, but this specific nickname sticks out. Maybe it's Prague? I've heard Prague is called the \"City of a Hundred Spires,\" but is that in Europe? Yes, Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic, which is definitely in Europe.\n\nLet me see if that makes sense. Prague has a rich history, and it's known for its architectural beauty, including many church spires. So, it seems plausible.\n\nBut maybe there's another city that also has this nickname. Is there any other European capital that's known for having a hundred spires? I can't think of any right now.\n\nWait, maybe Krakow in Poland? It's a beautiful city with many churches, but I don't recall it being called the \"City of a Hundred Spires.\" Maybe it's a different city in Poland.\n\nOr perhaps Salzburg in Austria? It's famous for its baroque architecture and churches, but again, I don't remember it being called by that nickname.\n\nLet me consider some other countries. In Germany, there are many cities with lots of churches, like Cologne, but its main attraction is the Cologne Cathedral, not a hundred spires.\n\nWhat about London? It has St. Paul's Cathedral and many churches, but I don't think it's called the \"City of a Hundred Spires.\"\n\nHmm, maybe it's a smaller European country. Let's think about the Czech Republic again. Prague is known for its Prague Castle and the Old Town with its towers and spires.\n\nI recall that the term \"City of a Hundred Spires\" refers to the numerous church spires that once dominated the city's skyline. Over the centuries, some of these spires may have been destroyed or rebuilt, but the nickname persists due to the city's enduring architectural character.\n\nAdditionally, Prague has been a center of culture and religion in Europe for many centuries, so it makes sense that it would have many churches and spires.\n\nLet me double-check this. If Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic and is known as the \"City of a Hundred Spires,\" then the answer should be the Czech Republic.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another city in Europe with this nickname. Let's see.\n\nAfter a quick search in my memory, it seems that Prague is indeed the most well-known city referred to as the \"City of a Hundred Spires.\" There might be other cities with similar nicknames, but Prague is the most famous one.\n\nTherefore, the European country in question is the Czech Republic, with Prague as its capital.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Czech Republic}} \\]"
