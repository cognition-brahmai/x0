        "content": "So, we've got this problem here about bacteria population growth. It says that the bacteria population doubles every hour, and we need to find out how many there will be after 8 hours, starting with an initial population of 50. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when something doubles every hour, it's growing exponentially. Exponential growth can be a bit tricky, but I think I've got it. The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times r^{t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the final population,\n\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial population,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate,\n\n- \\( t \\) is time.\n\nIn this case, the initial population \\( P_0 \\) is 50, the growth rate \\( r \\) is 2 (since it doubles), and time \\( t \\) is 8 hours. So, plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ P = 50 \\times 2^{8} \\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 2^{8} \\). Let's see:\n\n\\( 2^1 = 2 \\)\n\n\\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n\n\\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n\n\\( 2^4 = 16 \\)\n\n\\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n\n\\( 2^6 = 64 \\)\n\n\\( 2^7 = 128 \\)\n\n\\( 2^8 = 256 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 2^{8} = 256 \\). Now, multiply that by the initial population:\n\n\\[ P = 50 \\times 256 \\]\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n50 times 200 is 10,000, and 50 times 56 is 2,800. Wait, actually, 256 is 200 plus 56, but maybe it's easier to think of it as 250 plus 6.\n\nSo, 50 times 250 is 12,500, and 50 times 6 is 300. Adding those together:\n\n\\[ 12,500 + 300 = 12,800 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final population after 8 hours is 12,800 bacteria.\n\nBut, just to make sure, maybe I should check this another way. Maybe using a table to see the population at each hour.\n\nStarting with 50 bacteria at hour 0.\n\nHour 1: 50 times 2 = 100\n\nHour 2: 100 times 2 = 200\n\nHour 3: 200 times 2 = 400\n\nHour 4: 400 times 2 = 800\n\nHour 5: 800 times 2 = 1,600\n\nHour 6: 1,600 times 2 = 3,200\n\nHour 7: 3,200 times 2 = 6,400\n\nHour 8: 6,400 times 2 = 12,800\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 12,800 bacteria after 8 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of exponents. Starting with 50, and doubling each hour, it's like:\n\nHour 0: 50\n\nHour 1: 50 * 2^1 = 100\n\nHour 2: 50 * 2^2 = 200\n\n...\n\nHour 8: 50 * 2^8 = 50 * 256 = 12,800\n\nSame answer again. Looks like it's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the growth factor. Since it doubles every hour, the growth factor is 2 per hour. So, over 8 hours, the multiplication factor is 2 raised to the power of 8, which is 256, and 50 times 256 is 12,800.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The key is understanding that exponential growth means the population multiplies by a certain factor at each time interval, in this case, doubling every hour.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should note that in real life, bacterial growth might not continue exponentially forever because resources would eventually become limited, and other factors like waste accumulation could affect the population. But in this idealized scenario, we can assume unlimited resources and constant growth rate.\n\nSo, the answer is 12,800 bacteria after 8 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12800} \\]"
