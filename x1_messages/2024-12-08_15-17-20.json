        "content": "Let's see. There are 20 people in the group: 12 men and 8 women. Half of the men wear glasses, and one-third of the women wear glasses. I need to find out how many people do not wear glasses.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many men wear glasses. Since half of the 12 men wear glasses, that means 12 divided by 2, which is 6 men wear glasses.\n\nNext, for the women, one-third of them wear glasses. So, one-third of 8 women is 8 divided by 3, which is approximately 2.666, but since the number of people can't be a fraction, I'll need to think about this again. Wait, 8 divided by 3 is actually 2 with a remainder of 2, but in terms of fractions, it's 8/3, which is 2 and 2/3. However, people can't be divided into fractions, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me recheck: one-third of 8 women wear glasses. Well, 8 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 2, but in terms of exact division, it's 2.666..., but since we can't have a fraction of a person, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only whole numbers. Maybe it's intended that exactly 8/3 = 2.666... should be interpreted as 2 or 3 women wearing glasses, but that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to consider exact divisions only, and maybe the numbers are such that they work out to whole numbers. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that one-third of 8 is not a whole number, which suggests that the problem might have a mistake in the setup, but probably not. Maybe I need to assume that the number of women wearing glasses is exactly one-third of 8, which is 8/3, but since that's not a whole number, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be taken that exactly one-third of the women wear glasses, and since 8/3 is not a whole number, maybe it's a trick question, but that seems unlikely. Maybe I should just proceed with the assumption that the number of women wearing glasses is 8/3, which is approximately 2.666, and for the purpose of this calculation, we can consider it as 3 women wearing glasses, since rounding 2.666 to the nearest whole number is 3.\n\nSo, if 3 women wear glasses, then the total number of people wearing glasses is 6 men + 3 women = 9 people.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who do not wear glasses is the total number of people minus those who wear glasses: 20 - 9 = 11 people.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the interpretation of one-third of 8 women. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have whole numbers only, and maybe the one-third of 8 is meant to be exactly 8/3, but since that's not a whole number, perhaps the problem is misstated, or maybe it's expected that we recognize that one-third of 8 is not a whole number and thus cannot be applied in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to be interpreted as exactly one-third wearing glasses, and since 8/3 is not a whole number, perhaps the answer is that the situation is impossible, but that seems too pedantic for this kind of problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that one-third of 8 is approximately 2.666, and since we can't have a fraction of a person, we should either round up or down. If we round down, it's 2 women wearing glasses, and if we round up, it's 3.\n\nIf I assume 2 women wear glasses, then total wearing glasses is 6 men + 2 women = 8 people, and thus 20 - 8 = 12 people not wearing glasses.\n\nIf I assume 3 women wear glasses, then total wearing glasses is 6 men + 3 women = 9 people, and thus 20 - 9 = 11 people not wearing glasses.\n\nBut I need to decide which one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted exactly, and since one-third of 8 is not a whole number, the problem is invalid, but that seems too strict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to be taken that exactly one-third of the women wear glasses, and since 8/3 is not a whole number, perhaps the number of women wearing glasses is 8/3, and we accept that as a fractional person, but that doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted that approximately one-third of the women wear glasses, and since one-third of 8 is approximately 2.666, which is closer to 3, we can assume 3 women wear glasses.\n\nIn that case, total wearing glasses is 6 men + 3 women = 9 people, and thus 20 - 9 = 11 people do not wear glasses.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that one-third of 8 is exactly 8/3, and without rounding, then the total number of people wearing glasses is 6 men + 8/3 women = 6 + 8/3 = (18/3 + 8/3) = 26/3 people wearing glasses, which is approximately 8.666 people. Then, the number of people not wearing glasses would be 20 - 26/3 = (60/3 - 26/3) = 34/3, which is approximately 11.333 people. But again, people can't be divided into fractions, so this approach doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the best approach is to assume that approximately one-third of the women wear glasses, and round to the nearest whole number, which would be 3 women wearing glasses.\n\nThus, total wearing glasses is 6 men + 3 women = 9 people, and therefore, 20 - 9 = 11 people do not wear glasses.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider rounding down to 2 women wearing glasses, then total wearing glasses is 6 + 2 = 8 people, and 20 - 8 = 12 people not wearing glasses.\n\nBut since 8/3 is closer to 3 than to 2, I think rounding up to 3 is more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is that 11 people do not wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
