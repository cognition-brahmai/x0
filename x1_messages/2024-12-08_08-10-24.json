        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, and usually, 95% of them pass the inspection. I need to find out how many are expected to fail each day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 95% of 1000 is, since that's the number that passes. Then, I can subtract that from 1000 to find the failures.\n\nAlternatively, if 95% pass, that means 5% fail, right? Because 100% minus 95% is 5%.\n\nSo, maybe I can just calculate 5% of 1000 to find the number of failures.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n5% of 1000 is calculated by multiplying 1000 by 0.05.\n\n1000 times 0.05 is 50.\n\nSo, 50 widgets are expected to fail inspection each day.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if that makes sense.\n\nIf 95% pass, that's 950 widgets, because 1000 times 0.95 is 950.\n\nThen, 1000 minus 950 is indeed 50.\n\nSo, both ways, I get 50 widgets expected to fail.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
