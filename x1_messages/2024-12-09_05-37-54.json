        "content": "Let's see. There are two trains, one leaving from Station A to Station B at 50 miles per hour, and the other leaving from Station B to Station A at 70 miles per hour. The distance between the two stations is 300 miles. I need to find out how long it will take for these two trains to meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up when calculating how quickly they approach each other. So, the combined speed is 50 mph plus 70 mph, which is 120 mph.\n\nNow, since they're moving towards each other with a combined speed of 120 mph, and the distance between them is 300 miles, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 300 miles / 120 mph\n\nLet me calculate that. 300 divided by 120 is 2.5 hours.\n\nSo, it will take 2.5 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how far each train travels in a certain amount of time and set up an equation where the sum of the distances equals 300 miles.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time it takes for them to meet as t hours.\n\nThen, the distance traveled by the first train (from A to B) in t hours is 50t miles.\n\nThe distance traveled by the second train (from B to A) in t hours is 70t miles.\n\nSince they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the stations:\n\n50t + 70t = 300\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n120t = 300\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 300 / 120\n\nt = 2.5 hours\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider their relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is again 120 mph. So, the time it takes for them to cover the 300 miles at this relative speed is indeed 300 divided by 120, which is 2.5 hours.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the time. For example, are there any stops along the way, or is the speed constant? The problem doesn't mention any stops or changes in speed, so I'll assume the speeds are constant.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The distance is in miles, and the speeds are in miles per hour, so the time will be in hours, which is appropriate.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
