        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python script that implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for a graph represented by an adjacency matrix. I need to make sure that it's clear and straightforward since it's supposed to be in plain format.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what Dijkstra's algorithm is and how it works. Dijkstra's algorithm is a way to find the shortest path from one node to all other nodes in a graph. It's widely used in navigation and network routing. The algorithm works by maintaining a set of unvisited nodes and keeps track of the current shortest distance from the starting node to each node. It starts at the source node, marks it as current, and updates the distances to all its unvisited neighbors. Then, it selects the unvisited node with the smallest distance, marks it as current, and repeats the process until all nodes have been visited.\n\nNow, since the graph is represented by an adjacency matrix, that means we have a 2D list where the value at matrix[i][j] represents the weight of the edge between node i and node j. If there is no edge, the weight should be infinity or a special value indicating no connection.\n\nI need to decide on how to represent infinity in the matrix. In Python, there's a float('inf') that can represent infinity, which is convenient because it compares greater than any finite number.\n\nNext, I need to think about how to keep track of the visited nodes and the distances. I'll need a list to store the shortest distances from the source to each node, initialized with a large number (infinity) for all nodes except the source, which is zero.\n\nI also need a way to keep track of which nodes have been visited to avoid processing them multiple times. I can use a set or a list of booleans for this purpose.\n\nAs I iterate through the nodes, I need to select the unvisited node with the smallest distance. To do this efficiently, I can iterate through all unvisited nodes and find the one with the smallest distance value.\n\nOnce I select the current node, I need to update the distances to all its unvisited neighbors. If the distance through the current node is smaller than the previously known distance, I update the distance.\n\nI should also consider how to handle the case where the graph is not connected, meaning there are nodes that are unreachable from the source. In such cases, their distance should remain infinity, indicating no path exists.\n\nLet me outline the steps in pseudocode:\n\n1. Initialize distance list with infinity for all nodes except the source, which is 0.\n\n2. Create a set of unvisited nodes.\n\n3. While there are unvisited nodes:\n\na. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance as the current node.\n\nb. For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:\n\ni. Calculate the tentative distance through the current node.\n\nii. If this distance is less than the current known distance, update the distance.\n\n4. When the destination node is reached or all nodes are visited, the algorithm stops.\n\nNow, I need to translate this into Python code. I'll need to accept the adjacency matrix and the source node as inputs. I should also consider making the source node zero-based for simplicity.\n\nLet me think about edge cases:\n\n- A graph with a single node.\n\n- A graph with no edges except self-loops.\n\n- A graph with negative weight edges (Dijkstra's doesn't handle negative weights, so I should assume all weights are non-negative).\n\n- Disconnected graphs.\n\nI should also think about the time complexity. Since I'm using an adjacency matrix, the time complexity should be O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices, which is acceptable for dense graphs.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the graph. The adjacency matrix will be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row for a node, and each element in the row represents the weight to another node.\n\nFor example, for a graph with 3 nodes:\n\nmatrix = [\n\n[0, 1, float('inf')],\n\n[1, 0, 1],\n\n[float('inf'), 1, 0]\n\n]\n\nThis represents nodes 0 connected to 1 with weight 1, 1 connected to 0 and 2 with weight 1, and 2 connected to 1 with weight 1.\n\nIn this matrix, the diagonal is zero because there's no self-loop cost.\n\nI need to make sure that the matrix is symmetric if the graph is undirected, but Dijkstra's algorithm can work with directed graphs as well, so I should consider both possibilities.\n\nWait, actually, Dijkstra's algorithm can handle both directed and undirected graphs, depending on the adjacency matrix provided.\n\nI should also consider how to handle the case where the source node is out of range or invalid.\n\nLet me sketch a rough structure of the function:\n\ndef dijkstra(matrix, source):\n\n# Initialize distances\n\ndistances = [float('inf')] * len(matrix)\n\ndistances[source] = 0\n\nunvisited = set(range(len(matrix)))\n\nwhile unvisited:\n\n# Find the unvisited node with the smallest distance\n\ncurrent = min(unvisited, key=lambda node: distances[node])\n\n# Visit each unvisited neighbor\n\nfor neighbor, weight in enumerate(matrix[current]):\n\nif neighbor in unvisited and weight != float('inf'):\n\ntentative_distance = distances[current] + weight\n\nif tentative_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n\ndistances[neighbor] = tentative_distance\n\nunvisited.remove(current)\n\nreturn distances\n\nThis seems straightforward. I need to test this with some examples to ensure it works correctly.\n\nLet's take the example above with 3 nodes:\n\nmatrix = [\n\n[0, 1, float('inf')],\n\n[1, 0, 1],\n\n[float('inf'), 1, 0]\n\n]\n\nIf source is 0, the shortest distances should be [0, 1, 2].\n\nLet's walk through the algorithm:\n\n- Initialize distances: [0, inf, inf]\n\n- Unvisited: {0,1,2}\n\n- Select node 0 (smallest distance 0)\n\n- Update neighbors: node 1 distance becomes 1\n\n- Unvisited: {1,2}\n\n- Select node 1 (smallest distance 1)\n\n- Update neighbors: node 2 distance becomes 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Unvisited: {2}\n\n- Select node 2 (smallest distance 2)\n\n- No neighbors to update\n\n- Final distances: [0,1,2]\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAnother example with a disconnected graph:\n\nmatrix = [\n\n[0, 1, float('inf')],\n\n[1, 0, float('inf')],\n\n[float('inf'), float('inf'), 0]\n\n]\n\nSource is 0:\n\n- Initialize distances: [0, inf, inf]\n\n- Unvisited: {0,1,2}\n\n- Select node 0, update neighbor 1 to 1\n\n- Unvisited: {1,2}\n\n- Select node 1, no neighbors to update (since node 2 is inf)\n\n- Select node 2, no updates\n\n- Final distances: [0,1,inf]\n\nCorrect, since node 2 is unreachable from 0.\n\nNow, let's think about the code in terms of Python implementation. I need to make sure that the function accepts the matrix and source as parameters.\n\nI should also consider adding comments to the code for clarity.\n\nLet me also think about how to handle the input matrix. Should I assume that the matrix is square and correctly formatted? Or should I add checks to ensure that?\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that the matrix is square and correctly formatted, but in a real-world scenario, I should add checks for validity.\n\nAdditionally, I can add a main function to test the dijkstra function with some example matrices.\n\nLet me proceed to write the code accordingly.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for a graph represented by an adjacency matrix in Python, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\ndef dijkstra(matrix, source):\n    num_nodes = len(matrix)\n    distances = [float('inf')] * num_nodes\n    distances[source] = 0\n    unvisited = set(range(num_nodes))\n    \n    while unvisited:\n        # Select the node with the smallest distance\n        current = min(unvisited, key=lambda node: distances[node])\n        \n        # Update distances for unvisited neighbors\n        for neighbor in range(num_nodes):\n            weight = matrix[current][neighbor]\n            if weight != float('inf') and neighbor in unvisited:\n                tentative_distance = distances[current] + weight\n                if tentative_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                    distances[neighbor] = tentative_distance\n        \n        unvisited.remove(current)\n    \n    return distances\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example adjacency matrix for a graph with 3 nodes\n    matrix = [\n        [0, 1, float('inf')],\n        [1, 0, 1],\n        [float('inf'), 1, 0]\n    ]\n    source = 0\n    print(dijkstra(matrix, source))  # Output: [0, 1, 2]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create a list `distances` initialized with infinity for all nodes except the source node, which is set to 0.\n   - Use a set `unvisited` to keep track of nodes that have not been processed yet.\n\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - While there are unvisited nodes:\n     - Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance.\n     - For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:\n       - Calculate the tentative distance through the current node.\n       - If this distance is less than the previously known distance, update the distance.\n   - Remove the current node from the unvisited set.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - The function returns a list of the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input adjacency matrix is a square matrix with rows and columns corresponding to the nodes in the graph, and the source node index is zero-based. The matrix should use `float('inf')` to represent non-connected nodes."
