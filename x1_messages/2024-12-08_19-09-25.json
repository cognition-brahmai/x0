        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To create a Node.js script that reads a directory path from command line arguments and lists all files within the directory recursively, printing their file paths and sizes, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your project:**\n   - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.\n   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.\n\n2. **Initialize a new Node.js project:**\n   - Run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file with default settings.\n\n3. **Create the script:**\n   - Create a new JavaScript file, for example, `listFiles.js`.\n\n4. **Implement the functionality:**\n   - Use the `fs` (File System) and `path` modules which are built into Node.js.\n   - Read the directory path from command line arguments.\n   - Recursively traverse the directory and list all files with their paths and sizes.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\n// Read directory path from command line arguments\nconst dirPath = process.argv[2];\n\nif (!dirPath) {\n  console.error('Please provide a directory path.');\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n\n// Function to list all files recursively\nfunction listFilesRecursive(currentPath) {\n  const files = fs.readdirSync(currentPath);\n\n  files.forEach(file => {\n    const filePath = path.join(currentPath, file);\n    const stats = fs.statSync(filePath);\n\n    if (stats.isDirectory()) {\n      listFilesRecursive(filePath);\n    } else if (stats.isFile()) {\n      console.log(`${filePath} - ${stats.size} bytes`);\n    }\n  });\n}\n\ntry {\n  listFilesRecursive(dirPath);\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(`Error reading directory: ${error.message}`);\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Reading Command Line Arguments:**\n   - `process.argv` is used to read command line arguments. `process.argv[2]` corresponds to the first argument after the script name.\n\n2. **Checking if Directory Path is Provided:**\n   - If no directory path is provided, the script prints an error message and exits.\n\n3. **Recursive Function to List Files:**\n   - `listFilesRecursive` function reads the contents of the current directory.\n   - For each item, it checks if it's a directory or a file.\n   - If it's a directory, the function calls itself recursively.\n   - If it's a file, it prints the file path and its size in bytes.\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - Wrapped the recursive function call in a try-catch block to handle any errors that occur during directory reading.\n\n### How to Run the Script:\n\n1. **Save the script:**\n   - Save the above code in a file named `listFiles.js`.\n\n2. **Run the script:**\n   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `listFiles.js`.\n   - Run the script by providing the directory path as an argument:\n     ```sh\n     node listFiles.js /path/to/directory\n     ```\n\nThis will list all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories, along with their file paths and sizes.\n\n**Note:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read the directory and its contents."
