        "content": "So, I've got this probability question here: \"What's the probability of rolling two six-sided dice and getting a sum of 9?\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I'm familiar with probability, but let's make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst off, when you roll two six-sided dice, each die has numbers from 1 to 6, right? So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice should be 6 times 6, which is 36. Because each die is independent of the other.\n\nNow, I need to find out in how many of these 36 possible outcomes the sum of the two dice is 9. So, I should list out all the possible ways to get a sum of 9.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If the first die is 3, the second die needs to be 6 to make 9.\n\n- If the first die is 4, the second die needs to be 5.\n\n- If the first die is 5, the second die needs to be 4.\n\n- If the first die is 6, the second die needs to be 3.\n\nSo, that's four possible combinations: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), and (6,3).\n\nIs there any other way to get a sum of 9? Let's think: if the first die is 2, the second would need to be 7, but that's not possible because the highest on a die is 6. Similarly, if the first die is 1, the second would need to be 8, which is also impossible. So, only those four combinations work.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes.\n\nTo find the probability, I divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 4 divided by 36, which simplifies to 1/9.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider all the possible pairs that add up to 9. I've already listed them: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), and (6,3). No others, because (2,7) and (1,8) are invalid since dice only go up to 6.\n\nSo, yes, still 4 favorable outcomes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can consider the dice as distinct or indistinct. Wait, no, in probability problems with dice, we usually consider them distinct, meaning (3,6) is different from (6,3).\n\nSo, 36 possible outcomes, 4 favorable, probability is 4/36 = 1/9.\n\nAlternatively, if I calculate it another way, perhaps using combinations or something, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, probability is favorable outcomes over total outcomes, so 4/36 is correct.\n\nSimplifying, that's 1/9, which is approximately 0.1111, or 11.11%.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula for sum of two dice. I recall that the number of ways to get a sum \"s\" with two dice is s - 1, for s from 2 to 7, and then decreases symmetrically for s from 8 to 12.\n\nWait, let's see: for sum 2, only (1,1), so one way.\n\nSum 3: (1,2) and (2,1), so two ways.\n\nSum 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), three ways.\n\nSum 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), four ways.\n\nSum 6: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), five ways.\n\nSum 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1), six ways.\n\nThen, sum 8: (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2), five ways.\n\nWait, that's five ways for sum 8, not four. But earlier I only found four ways for sum 9.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing sum 8 with sum 9.\n\nLet me list for sum 8:\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (6,2)\n\nYes, five ways.\n\nFor sum 9:\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,3)\n\nThat's four ways.\n\nSo, indeed, sum 9 has four ways.\n\nSo, probability is 4/36 = 1/9.\n\nAlternatively, some people might think that since the number of ways decreases by one as the sum increases beyond 7, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, actually, for sum 7, it's six ways, sum 8 is five, sum 9 is four, sum 10 is three, sum 11 is two, and sum 12 is one.\n\nSo, yes, it's decreasing by one as the sum increases beyond 7.\n\nSo, for sum 9, it's four ways, which aligns with what I found.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 4/36, which simplifies to 1/9.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{9}} \\]"
