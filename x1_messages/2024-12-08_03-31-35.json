        "content": "Sure! Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. Below is a Python script that implements Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue to efficiently select the next vertex to visit.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start, end):\n    # Initialize distances and priority queue\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    priority_queue = [(0, start)]\n    \n    while priority_queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        \n        # Nodes can be added to the priority queue multiple times. We only\n        # process a node the first time it is removed from the priority queue.\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n        \n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():\n            distance = current_distance + weight\n            \n            # Only consider this new path if it's better\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))\n    \n    return distances[end]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example graph represented as an adjacency list\n    graph = {\n        'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},\n        'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},\n        'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},\n        'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}\n    }\n    \n    start_node = 'A'\n    end_node = 'D'\n    shortest_distance = dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node)\n    print(f\"The shortest distance from {start_node} to {end_node} is {shortest_distance}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We create a dictionary `distances` to store the shortest known distance from the start node to each node, initially set to infinity except for the start node itself, which is set to 0.\n   - A priority queue (implemented as a min-heap) is used to always expand the closest node.\n\n2. **Processing**:\n   - We repeatedly select the node with the smallest known distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighbor of the current node, we calculate the distance through the current node. If this distance is less than any previously known distance to the neighbor, we update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\n\n3. **Termination**:\n   - The algorithm continues until the priority queue is empty or the target node is processed.\n   - Finally, the shortest distance to the end node is returned.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the shortest path is found efficiently, provided that all edge weights are non-negative."
