        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how quicksort works:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot:** This can be any element in the array, but commonly it's the first or last element.\n\n2. **Partitioning:** Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and to the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.**\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python. I'll write a function called `quicksort` that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with the elements sorted in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    else:\n        pivot = arr[0]\n        less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]\n        greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]\n        return quicksort(less) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sample_list = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]\n    sorted_list = quicksort(sample_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Base Case:** If the list has one or no elements, it's already sorted, so we return the list as is.\n\n2. **Choosing the Pivot:** Here, we choose the first element of the list as the pivot.\n\n3. **Partitioning:** We create two lists:\n   - `less`: contains all elements less than or equal to the pivot.\n   - `greater`: contains all elements greater than the pivot.\n\n4. **Recursive Sorting:** We recursively sort the `less` and `greater` lists and concatenate them with the pivot in between.\n\n5. **Example Usage:** We test the function with a sample list and print the sorted result.\n\nThis implementation is straightforward and easy to understand. However, it's not the most efficient because it uses additional lists for the partitioning step. For larger lists, an in-place partitioning method would be more efficient in terms of space.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"
