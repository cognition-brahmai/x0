        "content": "So I've got this question here: If you have a circular pizza with a diameter of 16 inches, what is the area of the pizza in square inches? And it says to use \u03c0 approximately equal to 3.14.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to remember the formula for the area of a circle. I think it's A equals \u03c0 times the radius squared. Yeah, that sounds right. So, A = \u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives me the diameter, not the radius. I remember that the radius is half of the diameter. So, if the diameter is 16 inches, then the radius should be 16 divided by 2, which is 8 inches.\n\nSo, r = 8 inches.\n\nNow, plugging that into the formula, A = \u03c0 * (8)\u00b2.\n\nLet me calculate 8 squared. 8 times 8 is 64.\n\nSo, A = \u03c0 * 64.\n\nNow, it says to use \u03c0 approximately equal to 3.14. So, A \u2248 3.14 * 64.\n\nHmm, let's do that multiplication. 3.14 times 64.\n\nWell, 3 times 64 is 192.\n\n0.1 times 64 is 6.4.\n\n0.04 times 64 is 2.56.\n\nSo, adding those up: 192 + 6.4 is 198.4, plus 2.56 is 200.96.\n\nTherefore, the area of the pizza is approximately 200.96 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n3.14 times 64.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 3.14 times 60 is 188.4, and 3.14 times 4 is 12.56, and adding them up gives 200.96. Yeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll recall that the formula for the area of a circle is indeed A = \u03c0r\u00b2, and since the radius is half the diameter, that's why I divided 16 by 2 to get 8 inches.\n\nIf I had used the diameter instead of the radius, that would have been a mistake, but I think I got it right.\n\nAlso, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.14 is standard for these kinds of problems, so that should be fine.\n\nSo, the area of the pizza is approximately 200.96 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200.96} \\]"
