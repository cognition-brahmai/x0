        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. The numbers which remain unmarked are prime numbers.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:\n\n1. **Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n:** (2, 3, 4, ..., n).\n2. **Initially, let p equal 2, the smallest prime number.**\n3. **Mark all multiples of p (excluding p itself) as composite.** To do this, you can start from p^2, as all smaller multiples of p would have already been marked by smaller primes.\n4. **Find the smallest number in the list greater than p that is not marked.** If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.\n\nNow, let's translate this into Python code. We'll use a list to keep track of the numbers that are prime. Initially, we'll assume all numbers are prime (True), and then we'll mark the multiples of each prime number as not prime (False). Finally, we'll collect all the numbers that are still marked as prime.\n\nHere's the Python script:\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):\n    if limit < 2:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize a list to track prime status of numbers\n    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers\n    \n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= limit:\n        if is_prime[p]:\n            # Mark all multiples of p as composite\n            for multiple in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):\n                is_prime[multiple] = False\n        p += 1\n    \n    # Collect all prime numbers\n    primes = [num for num, prime in enumerate(is_prime) if prime]\n    return primes\n\n# Example usage:\nlimit = 30\nprimes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)\nprint(f\"Prime numbers up to {limit}: {primes}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - We create a list `is_prime` of size `limit + 1` and initialize all entries to `True`. This list will help us keep track of whether a number is prime.\n   - We set `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` to `False` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.\n\n2. **Sieve Algorithm:**\n   - We start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n   - We mark all multiples of each prime number starting from p^2 as not prime. We only need to consider multiples from p^2 because smaller multiples would have already been marked by smaller primes.\n   - We increment p to the next number that is still marked as prime and repeat the process until p * p is greater than the limit.\n\n3. **Collecting Primes:**\n   - After the algorithm completes, we collect all numbers that are still marked as prime in the `is_prime` list and return them.\n\nThis script is efficient for finding all primes up to a given limit and is a classic example of an ancient algorithm that still holds up well in modern computing."
