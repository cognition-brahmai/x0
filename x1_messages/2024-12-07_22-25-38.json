Each plan should have an associated evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to use:\nBing[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information via Bing's search engine. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from websites given an input string containing newline delimited links.\nLinkParser[input]: Parses plain text and produces a plain text, newline-delimited response of links.\nAIQA[input]: An artificial intelligence question answering model that answers questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :data[n]: variable.\n\nThe function input should be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with a data variable, e.g., AIQA[What is the capital of France, given :data3:?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n:data0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :data0:]\n:data1: = [next function to call and input parameter, referencing previous evidence if necessary]\n...\nAnswer: [:data[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the population of the largest city in Canada and what languages are commonly spoken there?"
