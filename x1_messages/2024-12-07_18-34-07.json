        "content": "Let's tackle this equation: 3x - 7 = 5x + 11. Okay, so I need to find the value of x that makes this equation true. I remember that the goal is to isolate x on one side of the equation. Let me think about how to do that.\n\nFirst, I should probably get all the x terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Let's see, if I subtract 3x from both sides, that should help. So, if I do that:\n\n3x - 7 - 3x = 5x + 11 - 3x\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n-7 = 2x + 11\n\nOkay, now I have -7 = 2x + 11. Next, I need to get rid of the 11 on the right side. I can do that by subtracting 11 from both sides:\n\n-7 - 11 = 2x + 11 - 11\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-18 = 2x\n\nNow, I need to solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n-18 / 2 = 2x / 2\n\nSo, x = -9\n\nWait, let me check that. Maybe I should plug it back into the original equation to make sure it's correct.\n\nOriginal equation: 3x - 7 = 5x + 11\n\nPlug in x = -9:\n\n3(-9) - 7 = 5(-9) + 11\n\nCalculate left side: 3*(-9) is -27, minus 7 is -34\n\nRight side: 5*(-9) is -45, plus 11 is -34\n\nSo, -34 = -34, which is true. Great, so x = -9 is the correct solution.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's try adding -5x to both sides instead of subtracting 3x.\n\nStarting again with 3x - 7 = 5x + 11\n\nAdd -5x to both sides:\n\n3x - 5x - 7 = 5x - 5x + 11\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-2x - 7 = 11\n\nNow, add 7 to both sides:\n\n-2x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7\n\nSo, -2x = 18\n\nThen, divide both sides by -2:\n\nx = 18 / -2 = -9\n\nAgain, x = -9. Good, same answer.\n\nMaybe I can try another method, like moving all terms to one side.\n\nStarting with 3x - 7 = 5x + 11\n\nSubtract 5x from both sides and add 7 to both sides:\n\n3x - 5x - 7 + 7 = 5x - 5x + 11 + 7\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n-2x = 18\n\nThen, x = -9\n\nSame result again. Seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have started by adding something else, but I think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer is definitely x = -9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-9} \\]"
