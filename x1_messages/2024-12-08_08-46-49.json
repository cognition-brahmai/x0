        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular garden that measures 50 feet in length and 30 feet in width, and I need to find out what the area is in square yards. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, in this case, it would be 50 feet times 30 feet. That should give me the area in square feet. But the question asks for the area in square yards, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square yards.\n\nI recall that 1 yard equals 3 feet. Therefore, 1 square yard would be 3 feet by 3 feet, which is 9 square feet. So, to convert from square feet to square yards, I need to divide the area in square feet by 9.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nArea in square feet = length \u00d7 width = 50 ft \u00d7 30 ft = 1500 square feet.\n\nNow, to convert to square yards:\n\nArea in square yards = area in square feet \u00f7 9 = 1500 \u00f7 9.\n\nHmm, 1500 divided by 9. Let's see:\n\n9 \u00d7 166 = 1494, which is 6 less than 1500. So, 166 and 2/3 square yards. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 9 \u00d7 166 = 1494, and 1500 minus 1494 is 6, so 6 divided by 9 is 2/3. So, yes, 166 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nBut let's double-check that conversion factor. Is 1 square yard really 9 square feet? Yeah, because 1 yard is 3 feet, so 1 yard \u00d7 1 yard = 3 feet \u00d7 3 feet = 9 square feet. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convert the measurements to yards before multiplying. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, then the length of 50 feet is 50 \u00f7 3 yards, and the width of 30 feet is 30 \u00f7 3 yards.\n\nSo, length in yards = 50 \u00f7 3 \u2248 16.666 yards.\n\nWidth in yards = 30 \u00f7 3 = 10 yards.\n\nNow, area in square yards = length in yards \u00d7 width in yards = 16.666 yd \u00d7 10 yd = 166.666 square yards.\n\nThat's the same as what I got earlier: 166 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nAlternatively, I can express 2/3 as a decimal. 2 divided by 3 is approximately 0.6667, so the area is approximately 166.6667 square yards.\n\nBut since the original measurements were given in whole numbers, maybe I should leave it as a fraction.\n\nSo, 1500 \u00f7 9 = 166 2/3 square yards.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express it in decimal form, it's approximately 166.67 square yards, rounding to two decimal places.\n\nBut, to be precise, it's 166.666... repeating.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should check if there's a better way to handle the units.\n\nLet me think about unit conversions more carefully.\n\nWe have:\n\n50 feet \u00d7 30 feet = 1500 square feet.\n\nAnd since 1 square yard = 9 square feet,\n\nThen, area in square yards = 1500 \u00f7 9 = 166.666... square yards.\n\nAlternatively, as a fraction, that's 166 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express it as 500/3 square yards, since 1500 \u00f7 9 = 1500/9 = 500/3 square yards.\n\nYes, 500 divided by 3 is 166 and 2/3.\n\nSo, all these are equivalent ways of expressing the same value.\n\nBut I think the most straightforward way is to say 166 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nAlternatively, if the context requires a decimal, then 166.67 square yards is acceptable, rounding to two decimal places.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify, I'll go with the fractional form.\n\nSo, the area of the garden is 166 and 2/3 square yards.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the initial calculations once more.\n\nGiven:\n\nLength = 50 feet\n\nWidth = 30 feet\n\nArea in square feet = 50 \u00d7 30 = 1500 sq ft\n\nSince 1 square yard = 9 square feet,\n\nArea in square yards = 1500 \u00f7 9 = 166.666... sq yd\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, converting feet to yards first:\n\nLength in yards = 50 \u00f7 3 \u2248 16.666 yards\n\nWidth in yards = 30 \u00f7 3 = 10 yards\n\nArea in square yards = 16.666 \u00d7 10 = 166.666 square yards\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the answer remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the area of the garden is 166 and 2/3 square yards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{166\\frac{2}{3}} \\]"
