This film marked a significant shift in Hollywood's approach to movie marketing and release strategies, as it was one of the first films to be given a wide release during the summer months and to be heavily marketed to audiences. The success of Jaws demonstrated that films could achieve massive box office returns during the summer, leading studios to increasingly focus on releasing big-budget films during this period."
