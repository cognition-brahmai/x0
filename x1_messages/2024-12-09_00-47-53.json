        "content": "So the factory originally produces 500 units of product A per day. They're planning to increase that by 20%, and also start producing 100 units of product B per day. I need to find out the total units produced daily after these changes.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 20% of 500 units is, since they're increasing product A's production by that amount. Then, add that increase to the original 500 units to get the new production amount for product A. After that, add the 100 units of product B to get the total production.\n\nLet me calculate 20% of 500. 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal form. So, 0.20 multiplied by 500 is:\n\n0.20 * 500 = 100 units.\n\nSo, the production of product A is increased by 100 units. Therefore, the new production amount for product A is:\n\n500 units + 100 units = 600 units.\n\nNow, they're also starting to produce 100 units of product B per day. So, to find the total units produced daily after these changes, I need to add the production of product A and product B together:\n\n600 units (product A) + 100 units (product B) = 700 units.\n\nTherefore, the total units produced daily after the changes are 700 units.\n\nBut let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. The original production is 500 units of product A. Increasing that by 20% means adding 100 units, bringing it to 600 units. Adding 100 units of product B should indeed total 700 units. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the increase in production as multiplying the original production by 1 plus the percentage increase. So, 500 units * 1.20 would give the new production of product A.\n\nLet me calculate that: 500 * 1.20 = 600 units, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, adding the 100 units of product B: 600 + 100 = 700 units.\n\nSo, no matter which way I look at it, the total daily production after the changes is 700 units.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]"
