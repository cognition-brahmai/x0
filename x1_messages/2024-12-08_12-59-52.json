        "content": "So here's this problem about two trains leaving the same station but at different times and going in the same direction. The first train leaves and goes east at 60 miles per hour, and then two hours later, another train leaves from the same station going in the same direction but faster, at 90 miles per hour. I need to figure out how many hours after the first train left it will take for the second train to catch up to the first one.\n\nOkay, so let's break this down. I need to find the time when the second train catches up to the first train, measured from when the first train left. So, if the first train has a head start of two hours, that means by the time the second train leaves, the first train is already 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles ahead.\n\nNow, the second train is going faster by 30 miles per hour (90 mph minus 60 mph). So, it's gaining on the first train at a rate of 30 miles per hour. I need to find out how long it takes for the second train to close that 120-mile gap at a relative speed of 30 miles per hour.\n\nI think I can use the formula for relative speed. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds since they're going in the same direction. So, relative speed = 90 mph - 60 mph = 30 mph.\n\nNow, time = distance / speed. The distance to be covered is the head start of the first train, which is 120 miles, and the relative speed is 30 mph. So, time = 120 miles / 30 mph = 4 hours.\n\nBut wait, this is the time after the second train leaves. The question asks for the time after the first train left. Since the second train leaves two hours later, the total time after the first train left would be 2 hours + 4 hours = 6 hours.\n\nLet me double-check this. Let's assume the first train has been traveling for t hours. Then, the second train has been traveling for t - 2 hours, since it left two hours later.\n\nThe distance covered by the first train is 60t miles, and the distance covered by the second train is 90(t - 2) miles. When the second train catches up, their distances are equal:\n\n60t = 90(t - 2)\n\nLet's solve for t:\n\n60t = 90t - 180\n\nSubtract 90t from both sides:\n\n60t - 90t = -180\n\n-30t = -180\n\nDivide both sides by -30:\n\nt = 6 hours\n\nSo, it takes 6 hours after the first train leaves for the second train to catch up.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the relative speed. The second train is catching up at 30 mph, and it needs to cover the 120-mile head start of the first train. Time = distance / speed = 120 / 30 = 4 hours. Since the second train leaves 2 hours later, total time from when the first train left is 2 + 4 = 6 hours.\n\nEither way, the answer is 6 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
