It wasn't meant to be like this...\n\nAnna: What are we going to do? We only have one bottle of water left...\n\nJack: Let's share it. If we take small sips and try not to use too much energy, it should last us a while.\n\nAnna: But what if no one comes? What if they don't find us?\n\nJack: They will, Anna. We just need to stay brave until then.\n\nAnna: Brave? How can you talk about bravery at a time like this? We're stranded in the middle of nowhere!\n\nJack: And that's exactly why we need to be brave, Anna. Because if we give up now, then we've lost for sure.\n\nAnna: You're right, Jack. We need to keep our hopes alive. Maybe someone will pass by soon...\n\nJack: That's the spirit, Anna! Let's sit under the shade of the car and wait. Someone is bound to come along eventually."
