        "content": "So there's a class with 20 students, and out of those, 12 are boys and 8 are girls. The teacher is going to pick one student at random, and we need to find out the probability that the student picked is a girl.\n\nProbability is basically about finding out the chances of something happening. In this case, it's the chance that the student chosen is a girl.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for probability. I think it's:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nSo, in this problem:\n\n- The number of favorable outcomes is the number of girls, which is 8.\n\n- The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of students, which is 20.\n\nSo, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\nProbability = 8 / 20\n\nNow, I can simplify this fraction. Both 8 and 20 can be divided by 4.\n\n8 \u00f7 4 = 2\n\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4.\n\nAnd if I want to express it as a percentage, I can multiply the decimal by 100, so 0.4 \u00d7 100 = 40%.\n\nSo, the probability that the student picked is a girl is 2/5, or 0.4, or 40%.\n\nJust to make sure, I can also think about it in another way. Since there are 12 boys and 8 girls, the probability of picking a boy would be 12/20, which simplifies to 3/5 or 0.6 or 60%. And since the total probability must add up to 1 (or 100%), then the probability of picking a girl should be 1 - 0.6 = 0.4, or 40%, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that probability can be expressed as a ratio, it would be 8:12, which simplifies to 2:3, but that's the ratio of girls to boys, not the probability of picking a girl.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the probability is about the favorable outcomes over the total outcomes, so it's still 8/20, which is 2/5.\n\nI think I've got it right. The probability is 2/5, or 0.4, or 40%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Is there any possibility that the teacher might not pick a girl, or are there any other constraints? The problem says it's a random pick, so each student has an equal chance of being picked, right?\n\nYes, in a random selection, each student has an equal probability of being chosen. So, the basic probability formula should suffice.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the proportion of girls in the class. Since girls make up 8 out of 20 students, their proportion is 8/20, which again simplifies to 2/5 or 40%.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the answer remains the same.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}} \\]"
