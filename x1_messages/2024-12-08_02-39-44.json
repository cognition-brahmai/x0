        "content": "So I've got this sequence where each term is given by the formula a_n = 3n - 2. I need to find the sum of the first 20 terms. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what kind of sequence this is. The formula a_n = 3n - 2 suggests that each term increases by a constant amount as n increases by 1. Let me check the first few terms to see the pattern.\n\nLet's calculate a_1:\n\na_1 = 3(1) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1\n\na_2 = 3(2) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4\n\na_3 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7\n\na_4 = 3(4) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10\n\nSo the sequence starts: 1, 4, 7, 10, ...\n\nI can see that each term increases by 3 from the previous one. So, this is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 1 and common difference d = 3.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nAlternatively, since I know the first term and the common difference, I could use:\n\nS_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]\n\nBut I think using S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n) is simpler. For that, I need to know a_n, the nth term.\n\nGiven that a_n = 3n - 2, for n = 20:\n\na_20 = 3(20) - 2 = 60 - 2 = 58\n\nSo, the 20th term is 58.\n\nNow, plugging into the sum formula:\n\nS_20 = 20/2 * (1 + 58) = 10 * 59 = 590\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, a_1 is indeed 1, and a_20 is 58. The number of terms n is 20.\n\nSo, S_20 = 20/2 * (1 + 58) = 10 * 59 = 590.\n\nAlternatively, using the other formula:\n\nS_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]\n\nS_20 = 20/2 * [2(1) + (20 - 1)3] = 10 * [2 + 57] = 10 * 59 = 590\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's verify with another approach. Maybe I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series directly from the sequence definition.\n\nGiven that the sequence is arithmetic with first term a_1 and common difference d, the sum of the first n terms is:\n\nS_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]\n\nWe already used this and got 590.\n\nAlternatively, since the general term is a_n = 3n - 2, I can sum this from n = 1 to n = 20.\n\nSo, S_20 = \u03a3 (from n=1 to 20) (3n - 2)\n\nI know that \u03a3 n = n(n + 1)/2 and \u03a3 1 = n.\n\nTherefore, S_20 = 3 * \u03a3 n - 2 * \u03a3 1, from n=1 to 20.\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\u03a3 n from 1 to 20 = 20 * 21 / 2 = 210\n\n\u03a3 1 from 1 to 20 = 20\n\nSo, S_20 = 3 * 210 - 2 * 20 = 630 - 40 = 590\n\nAgain, the same answer, 590.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this sequence as starting from a different point. Sometimes sequences are shifted, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The sequence is clearly defined by a_n = 3n - 2 for n from 1 to 20.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to list all the terms and add them up manually, it should also total 590, but that would be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLet me try adding the first and last terms, then the second and second-to-last, and so on, to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nLast term: 58\n\nSum: 59\n\nSecond term: 4\n\nSecond-to-last term: 55\n\nSum: 59\n\nThird term: 7\n\nThird-to-last term: 52\n\nSum: 59\n\nIt looks like each pair sums to 59, and since there are 20 terms, there are 10 such pairs.\n\nTherefore, total sum is 10 * 59 = 590.\n\nThis reinforces the earlier calculation.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the sum of the first 20 terms is indeed 590.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{590} \\]"
