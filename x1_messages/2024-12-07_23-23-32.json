        "content": "So the factory is currently producing 250 units per day, and they want to increase that by 15%. I need to find out how many units they'll produce daily after this increase.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 15% of 250 is, and then add that to the original 250 units. That makes sense.\n\nSo, to find 15% of 250, I can calculate it by multiplying 250 by 0.15. Let me do that:\n\n250 \u00d7 0.15 = 37.5\n\nSo, the increase is 37.5 units.\n\nNow, I need to add that increase to the original production:\n\n250 + 37.5 = 287.5\n\nTherefore, after the increase, the factory will produce 287.5 units daily.\n\nBut, since it's unlikely to produce half a unit, maybe I should round it to the nearest whole number. Let's see:\n\n287.5 rounds to 288 units.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 288 units daily after the increase.\n\nWait a minute, but the calculation gave me 287.5 exactly. Maybe the factory can produce half units, or perhaps I should consider if the unit is something that can be produced in fractions.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to leave it as 287.5 units.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nOriginal production: 250 units\n\nIncrease: 15% of 250 = 37.5 units\n\nTotal production: 250 + 37.5 = 287.5 units\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to calculate the total production after a 15% increase by multiplying the original production by 1.15.\n\nSo:\n\n250 \u00d7 1.15 = 287.5\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 287.5 units daily after the increase.\n\nIf the context requires a whole number, I might need to round it to 288 units.\n\nBut based on the calculation, 287.5 units is the exact amount.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{287.5} \\]"
