        "content": "Let's see. The store sells apples for $1.50 per pound, and the customer buys 4 pounds. So, first, I need to calculate the total cost of the apples.\n\nI can do this by multiplying the price per pound by the number of pounds:\n\nTotal cost = price per pound \u00d7 number of pounds\n\nTotal cost = $1.50 \u00d7 4\n\nNow, $1.50 times 4 is $6.00. So, the total cost of the apples is $6.00.\n\nThe customer pays with a $20 bill, and we need to find out how much change they will receive. To find the change, I'll subtract the total cost from the amount paid:\n\nChange = amount paid - total cost\n\nChange = $20.00 - $6.00\n\n$20.00 minus $6.00 is $14.00.\n\nSo, the customer will receive $14.00 in change.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The price per pound is $1.50, and 4 pounds would indeed be $6.00. Subtracting that from $20.00 should definitely be $14.00.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Maybe I can think of it another way. If the customer buys 4 pounds at $1.50 each, that's like buying 4 items at $1.50 each. So, 4 times $1.50 is $6.00. Paying with $20.00, the change should be $14.00.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many $1.50 units fit into $20.00, but that's not necessary for this problem since we know the total cost and the amount paid.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that each pound costs $1.50, so for 4 pounds, it's $6.00. The customer gives $20.00, so the change is $20.00 - $6.00 = $14.00.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Maybe I can consider if there's any sales tax or additional charges, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I'll assume that the price is exclusive of tax.\n\nTherefore, the change the customer will receive is $14.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
