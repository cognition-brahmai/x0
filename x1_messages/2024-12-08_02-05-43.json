        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, there are 200 houses, and each house has either a red or a blue door. The problem says that every third house has a red door, and every fifth house has a blue door. I need to find out how many houses have both red and blue doors.\n\nHmm, but wait a minute. If a house has both red and blue doors, that seems a bit confusing because the problem initially says each house has either a red or blue door. Maybe I misread that. Let me check again.\n\n\"Every house has either a red or blue door.\" So, no house can have both colors, right? Then why is the question asking for houses that have both red and blue doors? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"every third house has a red door\" and \"every fifth house has a blue door\" are overlapping in some houses, meaning some houses are being counted as both. But if each house has only one door, either red or blue, then how can a house have both?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to interpret this differently. Maybe the coloring of the doors is based on some pattern related to their ordering or numbering. Let's assume the houses are numbered from 1 to 200.\n\nIf every third house has a red door, that means houses numbered 3, 6, 9, up to 198 have red doors. Similarly, every fifth house has a blue door, so houses numbered 5, 10, 15, up to 200 have blue doors.\n\nBut the problem states that every house has either a red or blue door, which seems to suggest that all houses are covered by these two categories. However, if some houses are multiples of both 3 and 5, they would be houses that are being counted as both red and blue, which contradicts the initial statement that each house has either red or blue door.\n\nMaybe the intention is that houses that are multiples of both 3 and 5 have both colors, but that conflicts with the first statement. This is confusing.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem to understand it better. There are 200 houses, each with either a red or blue door. Two conditions are given:\n\n1. Every third house has a red door.\n\n2. Every fifth house has a blue door.\n\nIf a house is both a multiple of 3 and 5, i.e., a multiple of 15, then it's being specified to have both a red and blue door, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nPerhaps the correct interpretation is that:\n\n- Houses that are multiples of 3 have red doors.\n\n- Houses that are multiples of 5 have blue doors.\n\n- Houses that are multiples of neither 3 nor 5 have doors of the remaining color, but the problem says every house has either red or blue doors, so maybe there are no houses with doors of other colors.\n\nBut then, houses that are multiples of 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15) would have both red and blue doors, which again contradicts the first statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that houses that are multiples of 3 have red doors, and multiples of 5 have blue doors, and houses that are multiples of neither have blue doors. But that would mean some houses have blue doors based on being multiples of 5, and others have blue doors just because they're not multiples of 3. That seems messy.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find how many houses are multiples of both 3 and 5, i.e., multiples of 15, and see how many of those there are in 200 houses.\n\nLet me calculate that. The number of houses that are multiples of 15 up to 200 is floor(200/15), which is 13 times, since 15*13=195, and 15*14=210, which is beyond 200.\n\nSo, there are 13 houses that are multiples of both 3 and 5.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that these houses would have both red and blue doors, which contradicts the initial statement that each house has either red or blue door.\n\nMaybe the problem is poorly phrased, and what it really means is that houses that are multiples of 3 have red doors, and houses that are multiples of 5 have blue doors, and houses that are multiples of neither have blue doors. But that doesn't align with the statement that every house has either red or blue doors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find how many houses have doors that are both red and blue, given the overlapping conditions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that there are 13 houses with both red and blue doors, but that seems contradictory to the initial statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that houses that are multiples of both 3 and 5 have doors that are both red and blue, and to find that number.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be 13 houses.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find how many houses have red doors and blue doors, meaning houses that are multiples of 3 and 5, which are multiples of 15, and there are 13 such houses.\n\nSo, the answer is 13 houses have both red and blue doors.\n\nBut again, this seems contradictory to the initial statement that each house has either red or blue door.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to find how many houses have doors that are both red and blue, which would be the houses that are multiples of both 3 and 5, i.e., multiples of 15, and there are 13 such houses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13 houses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
