        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: a train travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 4 hours and 30 minutes to travel between two cities. I need to find out the distance between these cities.\n\nOkay, first things first, I know that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, speed is given as 60 miles per hour, and time is 4 hours and 30 minutes. But, I need to make sure that the units are consistent. That is, since the speed is in miles per hour, the time should be in hours.\n\nNow, 4 hours and 30 minutes... how do I convert that into hours? Well, 30 minutes is half an hour, so 4 hours plus 0.5 hours equals 4.5 hours.\n\nSo, time = 4.5 hours.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 4.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n60 times 4 is 240, and 60 times 0.5 is 30. So, 240 plus 30 equals 270.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two cities is 270 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the formula for speed, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nBut in this case, I have speed and time, and I need to find distance, so the first formula makes more sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the units:\n\n60 miles per hour times 4.5 hours... the hours cancel out, leaving miles, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had time in minutes, I would need to convert it to hours since the speed is in miles per hour.\n\nBut in this case, I already converted 4 hours and 30 minutes to 4.5 hours, so it should be fine.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe if the train wasn't traveling at a constant speed, but the problem says it's an average speed of 60 miles per hour, so using the formula should be acceptable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the train stops anywhere between the two cities, but the problem doesn't mention any stops, so I can assume that the entire time is spent traveling at that average speed.\n\nSo, I think 270 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
