        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in the class, and there are twice as many girls as boys. So, if we let the number of boys be B, then the number of girls would be 2B. Since the total number of students is 30, we can write the equation:\n\nB + 2B = 30\n\nThat simplifies to 3B = 30, so B = 10. That means there are 10 boys and 20 girls in the class.\n\nNow, half of the girls wear glasses. So, half of 20 girls is 10 girls who wear glasses.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many students do not wear glasses. To find that, we need to know how many students wear glasses and subtract that from the total number of students.\n\nWait a minute, the problem only tells us about the girls who wear glasses. It doesn't say anything about boys wearing glasses. So, perhaps we should assume that only girls wear glasses, and boys don't. But that seems like an assumption. Maybe some boys also wear glasses, but since it's not specified, maybe we should consider only the information given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that only girls wear glasses, but that seems unclear. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"In a class of 30 students, there are twice as many girls as boys. If half of the girls wear glasses, how many students in the class do not wear glasses?\"\n\nSo, it only specifies that half of the girls wear glasses, but it doesn't say anything about boys wearing glasses. Perhaps it's safe to assume that only girls wear glasses, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem assumes that only girls wear glasses, so the number of students who wear glasses is equal to the number of girls who wear glasses, which is 10, and therefore the number of students who do not wear glasses is 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nBut that seems a bit simplistic, and I'm worried that maybe some boys also wear glasses, and the problem just didn't mention it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to test something else. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider that only girls wear glasses, as per the information given, and proceed with that.\n\nSo, number of girls who wear glasses is 10, as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who do not wear glasses would be the total number of students minus the number of girls who wear glasses:\n\n30 - 10 = 20\n\nSo, 20 students do not wear glasses.\n\nBut wait, this seems too straightforward, and I'm still unsure about the assumption that only girls wear glasses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that only half of the girls wear glasses, and the rest of the students (boys and the other girls) do not wear glasses.\n\nBut again, that's assuming that no boys wear glasses, which may not be the case.\n\nI think the problem is ambiguous on this point, but perhaps according to standard problem-interpreting techniques, if it's not specified, we assume that only the specified group wears glasses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that some boys might wear glasses, but since it's not specified, I can't determine that number, so perhaps the problem is expecting the answer based on the information provided, which is only about girls wearing glasses.\n\nIn that case, the number of students who wear glasses is 10 (half of the girls), and therefore the number who do not wear glasses is 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to interpret this.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of students who do not wear glasses.\n\nWe have 10 boys, and 20 girls.\n\nHalf of the girls wear glasses, so 10 girls wear glasses, which implies that the other 10 girls do not wear glasses.\n\nAdditionally, if no boys wear glasses (which is an assumption), then all 10 boys do not wear glasses.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who do not wear glasses would be the 10 girls who do not wear glasses plus the 10 boys who do not wear glasses, totaling 20 students.\n\nBut again, this assumes that no boys wear glasses, which may not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if some boys do wear glasses, then the number of students who do not wear glasses would be less than 20.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the safest assumption is that only girls wear glasses, based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 students do not wear glasses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to test the understanding of complementary counting.\n\nThat is, total students minus those who wear glasses equals those who do not wear glasses.\n\nWe know that half of the girls wear glasses, and girls are 20 in number, so 10 girls wear glasses.\n\nIf we assume that no boys wear glasses, then the number of students who wear glasses is 10, and therefore those who do not wear glasses are 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nAlternatively, if some boys wear glasses, then the number would be different, but since it's not specified, perhaps the problem expects the answer based on the given information, assuming only girls wear glasses.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 20 students do not wear glasses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
