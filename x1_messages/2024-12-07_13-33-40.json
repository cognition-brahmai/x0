        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To develop a Node.js application that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather conditions for a specified city, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your Node.js project:**\n   - Initialize a new Node.js project by creating a directory and running `npm init` to set up the `package.json` file.\n\n2. **Install required packages:**\n   - You'll need to make HTTP requests to the API. For this, you can use the `axios` package, which is a promise-based HTTP client. Install it using:\n     ```bash\n     npm install axios\n     ```\n\n3. **Get an API key from OpenWeatherMap:**\n   - Sign up on the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) and obtain an API key.\n\n4. **Create the Node.js script:**\n   - Create a new JavaScript file, for example, `weather.js`.\n\n5. **Write the code to fetch and display weather data:**\n   - Use `axios` to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n   - Parse the response to extract and display the relevant weather information.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to get you started:\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\n// Replace 'YourApiKey' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key\nconst apiKey = 'YourApiKey';\nconst city = 'London'; // You can change this to any city you want\n\n// Construct the API URL\nconst url = `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}&units=metric`;\n\n// Function to fetch and display weather data\nasync function getWeather() {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.get(url);\n    const data = response.data;\n    console.log(`Weather in ${data.name}:`);\n    console.log(`Temperature: ${data.main.temp}\u00b0C`);\n    console.log(`Weather: ${data.weather[0].description}`);\n    console.log(`Humidity: ${data.main.humidity}%`);\n    console.log(`Wind Speed: ${data.wind.speed} m/s`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching weather data:', error.message);\n  }\n}\n\n// Call the function\ngetWeather();\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Setting up the project:**\n   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.\n   - Run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.\n\n2. **Installing `axios`:**\n   - `axios` is used for making HTTP requests. It's installed via npm.\n\n3. **Getting the API key:**\n   - Sign up on OpenWeatherMap and obtain an API key.\n\n4. **Creating the script:**\n   - In `weather.js`, import `axios`.\n   - Define the API key and the city for which you want to fetch weather data.\n   - Construct the API URL with query parameters.\n   - Define an asynchronous function `getWeather` to fetch and display the data.\n   - Use `axios.get` to make the request and handle the response or catch any errors.\n\n5. **Running the script:**\n   - Save the file and run it using Node.js:\n     ```bash\n     node weather.js\n     ```\n\nThis will display the current weather conditions for the specified city. You can modify the code to accept city names as command-line arguments or integrate it into a larger application as needed."
