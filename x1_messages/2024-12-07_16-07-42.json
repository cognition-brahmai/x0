        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly. \"A bag contains 4 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 6 green balls. If a ball is drawn at random, what is the probability that it is not blue?\" Okay, so I need to find the probability that the ball drawn isn't blue.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In formula terms, that's:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{event}) = \\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the event is drawing a ball that is not blue.\n\nSo, let's identify the total number of possible outcomes. That would be the total number of balls in the bag. There are 4 red, 5 blue, and 6 green balls. So, total balls are:\n\n\\[ 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \\]\n\nSo, there are 15 balls in total.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are the cases where I draw a ball that is not blue. That means it can be either red or green.\n\nThere are 4 red balls and 6 green balls, so the number of favorable outcomes is:\n\n\\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a ball that is not blue is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{not blue}) = \\frac{10}{15} \\]\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10 \\div 5}{15 \\div 5} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the complement rule. The complement of drawing a not blue ball is drawing a blue ball. So, the probability of not drawing blue is 1 minus the probability of drawing blue.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nFirst, find the probability of drawing a blue ball.\n\nNumber of blue balls is 5, total balls are 15.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(\\text{blue}) = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ P(\\text{not blue}) = 1 - P(\\text{blue}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Suppose I consider the probabilities separately for each color.\n\nProbability of drawing red:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{red}) = \\frac{4}{15} \\]\n\nProbability of drawing green:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{green}) = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\nThen, the probability of drawing not blue would be the sum of these two probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{not blue}) = P(\\text{red}) + P(\\text{green}) = \\frac{4}{15} + \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, no matter how I approach it, I end up with \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. The complement rule is often a quicker way to solve these kinds of problems, especially when the event of interest is a bit complicated. But in this case, both the direct method and the complement method are straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance that the balls are drawn without replacement or something like that, but the problem says \"drawn at random,\" and it's singular, so it's just one draw. So, no need to worry about replacement.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not overcomplicating things. The problem is pretty straightforward: find the probability of not drawing a blue ball from a bag containing balls of three different colors.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nI can also express this in decimal or percentage form if needed. \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is approximately 0.6667, or about 66.67%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form, I'll stick with the fraction.\n\nI think that's it. Probability of not drawing a blue ball is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
