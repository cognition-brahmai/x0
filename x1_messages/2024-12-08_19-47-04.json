They make you laugh when you're down, and they celebrate with you when you're up. It's like having your own personal support system, you know?\n\nTake me and the guys, for example. Me, Chandler, Ross, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel. We've been through so much together. From figuring out love and life to just hanging out and watching movies. Friends are like family, but you choose them, which makes it even better, if that makes sense.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the times we've helped each other out. Like when I was trying to get that job at Cheers, or when Chandler was dealing with his whole welcome home thing. Friends are there to give you advice, even if it's bad advice sometimes. Hey, at least you know they care, right?\n\nSo, to me, friendship is all about loyalty, trust, and a whole lot of laughter. It's about being there for each other no matter what, and knowing that you can always count on your friends to have your back. It's like a safety net when life gets crazy, and who doesn't need that?\n\nIn the end, friends are the family you choose, and that's something special. So, cherish your friends, because they make life so much richer and more enjoyable. That's what friendship means to me."
