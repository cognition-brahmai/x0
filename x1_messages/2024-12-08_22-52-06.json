        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. You're drawing one ball at random, putting it back, and then drawing another ball. You want to know the probability of drawing two red balls in a row.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw. There are 5 red balls out of 8 total balls, so the probability is 5/8.\n\nNow, because you're putting the ball back into the bag before drawing the second ball, the total number of balls remains the same, and the probabilities don't change. So, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is also 5/8.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014drawing a red ball first and then another red ball\u2014\u6211\u4eec need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing two red balls in a row is (5/8) * (5/8) = 25/64.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 25/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{64}} \\]"
