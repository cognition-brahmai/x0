        "content": "Let's see here. So, the train travels between two cities that are 200 miles apart, and it takes 4 hours to go from City A to City B. That means the train's speed is constant, right? So, first, I need to find out the speed of the train.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time, right? So, speed equals 200 miles divided by 4 hours, which is 50 miles per hour. Okay, so the train travels at 50 miles per hour.\n\nNow, on the return journey from City B back to City A, the train stops for 30 minutes at a station halfway between the two cities. Halfway would be 100 miles from City B, since the total distance is 200 miles.\n\nSo, the train travels 100 miles from City B to the station, stops for 30 minutes, and then travels another 100 miles from the station back to City A.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how long it takes to travel 100 miles at 50 miles per hour.\n\nTime equals distance divided by speed, so 100 miles divided by 50 miles per hour is 2 hours.\n\nSo, the train takes 2 hours to get to the station, stops for 30 minutes, and then takes another 2 hours to get back to City A.\n\nSo, total time is 2 hours + 0.5 hours + 2 hours, which is 4.5 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nThe speed is constant at 50 miles per hour, and the distance for each leg of the trip is 100 miles, so each leg takes 2 hours. Plus the 30-minute stop.\n\nSo, yes, 2 hours + 0.5 hours + 2 hours equals 4.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, the total distance is 200 miles, at 50 miles per hour, which would be 4 hours, plus the 0.5-hour stop, totaling 4.5 hours.\n\nEither way, the total time is 4.5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
