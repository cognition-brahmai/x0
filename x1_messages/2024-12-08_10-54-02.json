He is well-known for his works set in the Arctic, such as \"The Call of the Wild\" and \"White Fang.\" Interestingly, \"London\" can also refer to a type of sled used in Arctic regions, although I must clarify that it's not directly named after the author. The sled is called an \"Arctic sled\" or \"dog sled,\" but perhaps there's a specific type named \"London sled\" that I'm not aware of. However, given the context, Jack London is the author you're thinking of."
