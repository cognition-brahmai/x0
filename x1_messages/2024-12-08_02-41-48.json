        "content": "So the company sells two products, A and B, with different profit margins. Product A has a 20% profit margin, and Product B has a 40% profit margin. They sold $10,000 worth of Product A and $5,000 worth of Product B. I need to find out their total profit from these sales.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a profit margin is. A profit margin is the percentage of the selling price that is turned into profit. So, for Product A, for every dollar sold, 20 cents is profit. Similarly, for Product B, 40 cents out of every dollar sold is profit.\n\nTo find the profit from Product A, I can calculate 20% of $10,000. Similarly, for Product B, I'll calculate 40% of $5,000. Then, I'll add both profits to get the total profit.\n\nLet me start with Product A:\n\nProfit from Product A = 20% of $10,000\n\nI know that 20% is the same as 20/100 or 0.20. So,\n\nProfit from Product A = 0.20 * $10,000\n\nNow, calculating that:\n\n0.20 * 10,000 = $2,000\n\nSo, the profit from Product A is $2,000.\n\nNext, Product B:\n\nProfit from Product B = 40% of $5,000\n\nSimilarly, 40% is 40/100 or 0.40.\n\nProfit from Product B = 0.40 * $5,000\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.40 * 5,000 = $2,000\n\nSo, the profit from Product B is $2,000.\n\nNow, to find the total profit, I'll add both profits together:\n\nTotal profit = Profit from Product A + Profit from Product B\n\nTotal profit = $2,000 + $2,000 = $4,000\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total sales and some weighted average profit margin, but since the products have different sales amounts and different margins, it's probably more accurate to calculate each profit separately and then sum them up, which is what I did.\n\nAnother way to approach this could be to find the total sales first:\n\nTotal sales = Sales of Product A + Sales of Product B = $10,000 + $5,000 = $15,000\n\nThen, if I were to find an average profit margin, it would be weighted by the sales amounts.\n\nWeighted average profit margin = (Sales of A * Margin of A + Sales of B * Margin of B) / Total sales\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nWeighted average profit margin = ($10,000 * 0.20 + $5,000 * 0.40) / $15,000\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n($10,000 * 0.20) = $2,000\n\n($5,000 * 0.40) = $2,000\n\nTotal numerator = $2,000 + $2,000 = $4,000\n\nNow, divide by total sales:\n\n$4,000 / $15,000 = approximately 0.2667 or 26.67%\n\nSo, the weighted average profit margin is about 26.67%.\n\nThen, total profit would be weighted average margin times total sales:\n\nTotal profit = 26.67% * $15,000 = approximately $4,000\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier by summing the individual profits.\n\nThis confirms that my initial calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the total profit is $4,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000} \\]"
