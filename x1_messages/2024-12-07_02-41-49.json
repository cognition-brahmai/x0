        "content": "So there are 12 socks in total: 6 red, 4 blue, and 2 green. I need to find the probability that both socks picked are red. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are picking two red socks, and the total outcomes are picking any two socks from the drawer.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick two socks from 12 is a combination problem, right? Because the order doesn't matter when picking socks. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 socks out of 12 is denoted as C(12,2). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 red socks out of 6 is C(6,2).\n\nSo, the probability P that both socks are red is P = C(6,2) / C(12,2).\n\nNow, I need to calculate C(6,2) and C(12,2). The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nFirst, C(6,2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = (6*5*4!) / (2*1*4!) = (6*5) / 2 = 15.\n\nNext, C(12,2) = 12! / (2!(12-2)!) = (12*11*10!) / (2*1*10!)) = (12*11) / 2 = 66.\n\nTherefore, P = 15 / 66.\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: 15/3 = 5, 66/3 = 22. So, P = 5/22.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst pick: The probability that the first sock is red is 6/12, since there are 6 red socks out of 12.\n\nAfter picking one red sock, there are now 5 red socks left and a total of 11 socks remaining.\n\nSo, the probability that the second sock is also red is 5/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both socks are red is (6/12) * (5/11) = (1/2) * (5/11) = 5/22.\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier result. So, the probability is 5/22.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's another approach.\n\nSuppose I think about it in terms of permutations. If the order matters, then:\n\nTotal ways to pick two socks in order: 12 choices for the first sock, 11 for the second, so 12*11 = 132.\n\nNumber of ways to pick two red socks in order: 6 choices for the first red sock, 5 for the second, so 6*5 = 30.\n\nThen, the probability would be 30 / 132 = 30/132 = 15/66 = 5/22.\n\nAgain, the same answer. So, no matter which method I use, I get 5/22.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But just to be extra sure, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nAre there any dependencies or conditions that could affect the probability? For example, are the socks being picked with replacement? No, the problem says \"without looking,\" implying without replacement.\n\nAlso, all socks are distinct, but since they're only categorized by color, and the problem doesn't specify that the socks are distinguishable beyond their color, I think treating them as indistinguishable except for color is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each sock is unique, the calculation would be more complicated, but in probability problems like this, it's standard to treat items of the same type as identical.\n\nSo, I think 5/22 is the correct probability that both socks picked are red.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{22}} \\]"
