        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming a committee of 3 people from a group of 8 men and 5 women, and the condition is that at least one woman must be included. I need to figure out how many ways this can be done.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"at least one woman\" means in this context. It means that the committee can have 1 woman, 2 women, or all 3 women. So, I need to consider all these possibilities.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 3 people without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that have no women at all. That should give me the number of committees that have at least one woman.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of ways to form a committee of 3 from 13 people (8 men + 5 women). I think this is a combination problem, so I'll use the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of people, and \\(k\\) is the number of people to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways:\n\n\\[\nC(13, 3) = \\frac{13!}{3!(13 - 3)!} = \\frac{13!}{3! \\cdot 10!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 286\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the number of committees with no women, which means all men. There are 8 men, so the number of ways to choose 3 men from 8 is:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8 - 3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of committees with at least one woman is:\n\n\\[\n286 - 56 = 230\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check this approach. Is there another way to verify this answer?\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of committees with exactly 1 woman, exactly 2 women, and exactly 3 women, and then add them up.\n\nFirst, exactly 1 woman and 2 men:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 woman from 5:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 1) = 5\n\\]\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 men from 8:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, total for this case:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 28 = 140\n\\]\n\nNext, exactly 2 women and 1 man:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 women from 5:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 man from 8:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 1) = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, total for this case:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 8 = 80\n\\]\n\nThen, exactly 3 women:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 women from 5:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n\\[\n140 + 80 + 10 = 230\n\\]\n\nOkay, this matches the previous result. So, the number of committees with at least one woman is 230.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, is there a possibility of having more than one committee, or any overlapping members? No, the problem seems straightforward: form one committee of 3 people with at least one woman from a group of 8 men and 5 women.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not counting any committees multiple times. In the approach I took, since I'm using combinations, each committee is unique and not repeated.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the positions in the committee matter. The problem doesn't specify any roles, so I assume that the committee is unordered, which justifies using combinations.\n\nLet me also check if there's a more efficient way to calculate this. The initial approach of total committees minus all-men committees seems more efficient than calculating each possible woman count separately. Both methods give the same answer, which reinforces that 230 is correct.\n\nIs there any chance that the total number of people is not 13? Let's see: 8 men + 5 women = 13 people. That seems right.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll quickly recalculate the combinations.\n\nTotal committees:\n\n\\[\nC(13, 3) = 286\n\\]\n\nAll-men committees:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\\]\n\nSo, 286 - 56 = 230.\n\nAlternatively, sum of committees with at least one woman:\n\n\\[\nC(5,1) \\times C(8,2) + C(5,2) \\times C(8,1) + C(5,3) \\times C(8,0) = 140 + 80 + 10 = 230\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out. I think 230 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{230} \\]"
