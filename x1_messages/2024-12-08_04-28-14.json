        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets every day. On Monday, 5% of those widgets were defective. That means on Monday, the number of defective widgets is 5% of 1000. Let's calculate that first.\n\n5% of 1000 is (5/100) * 1000 = 50 widgets were defective on Monday.\n\nNow, on Tuesday, the number of defective widgets increased by 50%. So we need to find out what 50% of Monday's defective widgets is and add that to Monday's count to get Tuesday's count.\n\n50% of 50 is (50/100) * 50 = 25.\n\nSo, the number of defective widgets on Tuesday is Monday's defective widgets plus the increase:\n\n50 + 25 = 75.\n\nTherefore, 75 widgets were defective on Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Another way to think about a 50% increase is to multiply Monday's defective widgets by 1.5.\n\nSo, 50 * 1.5 = 75.\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer is 75 defective widgets on Tuesday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
