        "content": "Let's see. There are two cities that are 240 miles apart, and a train travels between them at a constant speed. It takes 4 hours to complete the journey without any stops. But in this scenario, the train stops at a station exactly halfway between the two cities for 30 minutes. I need to find out how long the entire journey takes including this stop.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the train's speed. Since it travels 240 miles in 4 hours at a constant speed, I can calculate the speed by dividing the distance by the time. So, speed equals distance divided by time, which is 240 miles divided by 4 hours. That gives me 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, the train stops halfway for 30 minutes. Halfway means it stops at 120 miles from the starting point. So, the journey can be divided into two legs: from the starting point to the halfway station, and then from the halfway station to the final destination.\n\nEach leg is 120 miles since it's halfway. Given that the train travels at 60 miles per hour, I can calculate the time for each leg by dividing the distance by the speed. So, time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nFor each leg: 120 miles divided by 60 miles per hour equals 2 hours.\n\nSo, without stops, the total time would be 4 hours, which matches the given information. But now there's a 30-minute stop at the halfway point.\n\nTo find the total journey time including the stop, I need to add the time for both legs and the stop time.\n\nFirst leg: 2 hours\n\nStop: 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour)\n\nSecond leg: 2 hours\n\nTotal time = 2 + 0.5 + 2 = 4.5 hours\n\nSo, the entire journey takes 4.5 hours.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. The train travels 120 miles at 60 mph, which takes 2 hours, then stops for 0.5 hours, and then travels another 120 miles at 60 mph, taking another 2 hours. Adding them up: 2 + 0.5 + 2 equals indeed 4.5 hours.\n\nAlternatively, since the original journey without stops is 4 hours, and we're adding a 30-minute stop, it should simply be 4 hours plus 0.5 hours, which again is 4.5 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
