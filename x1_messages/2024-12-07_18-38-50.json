        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Creating a simple command-line calculator in Python is a great way to get started with programming. I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a command-line calculator does. It's a program that takes user input, performs a specified arithmetic operation, and displays the result. In this case, we'll support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nHere's a plan for our calculator:\n\n1. **Display a menu**: Show the user the available operations.\n2. **Get user input**: Ask the user to choose an operation and enter two numbers.\n3. **Perform the operation**: Based on the user's choice, perform the appropriate arithmetic operation.\n4. **Display the result**: Show the result of the operation.\n5. **Handle errors**: Make sure the program doesn't crash if the user enters invalid input.\n\nLet's start by writing the code step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Display a menu\n\nWe'll display a simple menu showing the operations available:\n\n```\nCalculator Menu:\n1. Addition\n2. Subtraction\n3. Multiplication\n4. Division\n```\n\n### Step 2: Get user input\n\nWe need to get two numbers and the operation choice from the user. We'll use the `input()` function for this.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the operation\n\nBased on the user's choice, we'll perform the corresponding operation:\n\n- Addition: `num1 + num2`\n- Subtraction: `num1 - num2`\n- Multiplication: `num1 * num2`\n- Division: `num1 / num2`\n\n### Step 4: Display the result\n\nAfter performing the operation, we'll display the result to the user.\n\n### Step 5: Handle errors\n\nWe need to handle cases where the user enters invalid input, such as non-numeric values or choosing an invalid operation. Additionally, we should handle division by zero.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Calculator Menu:\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    try:\n        choice = int(input(\"Enter your choice (1-4): \"))\n        if choice not in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid operation.\")\n            return\n\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n        if choice == 1:\n            result = num1 + num2\n            operation = \"addition\"\n        elif choice == 2:\n            result = num1 - num2\n            operation = \"subtraction\"\n        elif choice == 3:\n            result = num1 * num2\n            operation = \"multiplication\"\n        elif choice == 4:\n            if num2 == 0:\n                print(\"Error: Division by zero.\")\n                return\n            result = num1 / num2\n            operation = \"division\"\n\n        print(f\"Result of {operation}: {result}\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Menu Display**: We print the menu options for the user to see.\n2. **User Input**: We take the operation choice and two numbers from the user.\n3. **Operation Performance**: Based on the choice, we perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n4. **Result Display**: We display the result of the operation.\n5. **Error Handling**: We use try-except blocks to handle invalid inputs and division by zero.\n\nThis should give you a basic but functional command-line calculator in Python. You can run this code in your Python environment, and it will prompt you for input and display the results accordingly.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
