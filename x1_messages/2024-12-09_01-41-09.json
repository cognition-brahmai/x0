        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 3 defective light bulbs and 7 non-defective ones, making a total of 10 light bulbs. The question is, if I pick two light bulbs at random without putting the first one back, what's the chance that both are defective?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember how probability works, especially when it comes to multiple events without replacement. Since the light bulbs are being selected without replacement, the probability changes after the first selection because the total number of light bulbs decreases by one.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the probability of selecting a defective light bulb on the first pick.\n\nThere are 3 defective light bulbs out of 10 total light bulbs, so the probability is 3/10.\n\nStep 2: Given that the first light bulb selected was defective, find the probability that the second one is also defective.\n\nNow, since we've already taken one defective light bulb out of the box, there are only 2 defective light bulbs left, and the total number of light bulbs remaining is 9. So, the probability for the second pick is 2/9.\n\nStep 3: To find the overall probability that both light bulbs are defective, I need to multiply the probabilities from Step 1 and Step 2.\n\nSo, overall probability = (3/10) * (2/9)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply the numerators: 3 * 2 = 6\n\nThen, multiply the denominators: 10 * 9 = 90\n\nSo, the probability is 6/90.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n6 \u00f7 6 = 1\n\n90 \u00f7 6 = 15\n\nSo, the simplified probability is 1/15.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can also think about it in terms of combinations to verify.\n\nAlternative approach using combinations:\n\nThe total number of ways to select 2 light bulbs out of 10 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 2 light bulbs out of 10 is C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 * 9)/2 = 45.\n\nNow, the number of ways to select 2 defective light bulbs out of 3 is C(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3 - 2)!) = (3 * 2)/2 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both selected light bulbs are defective is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 3/45, which simplifies to 1/15.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the probability is indeed 1/15.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's another way to look at this problem. For example, could I use permutations instead of combinations? Let's see.\n\nUsing permutations:\n\nThe number of ways to select 2 defective light bulbs in order is 3 options for the first pick and 2 for the second, so 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nThe total number of ways to select any 2 light bulbs in order is 10 options for the first pick and 9 for the second, so 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 6/90, which again simplifies to 1/15.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 1/15 is correct.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other factor I might have missed, like whether the light bulbs are identical or if there's any other condition that could affect the probability. But in this problem, all that's given is the number of defective and non-defective light bulbs, and that they are selected without replacement.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the selection is random, which it is, meaning each light bulb has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nSo, I think I've covered all the bases here. The probability that both selected light bulbs are defective is 1/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{15}} \\]"
