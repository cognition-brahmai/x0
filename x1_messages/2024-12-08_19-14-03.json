        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a circular pond with a diameter of 10 meters, and I need to find out its area in square meters. I'm supposed to use \u03c0 approximately equal to 3.14. Alright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst things first, I need to remember the formula for the area of a circle. I think it's A equals \u03c0 times the radius squared. Yes, that sounds right. So, A = \u03c0r\u00b2. But wait, the problem gives me the diameter, not the radius. I know that the radius is half of the diameter, so if the diameter is 10 meters, then the radius should be 5 meters.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDiameter (d) = 10 meters\n\nRadius (r) = d / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 meters\n\nNow, plugging these values into the area formula:\n\nA = \u03c0r\u00b2 = 3.14 \u00d7 (5)\u00b2\n\nI need to square the radius first, so 5 squared is 25.\n\nThen, A = 3.14 \u00d7 25\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication:\n\n3.14 \u00d7 25 = 78.5\n\nSo, the area of the pond is 78.5 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nDiameter is 10 meters, so radius is 5 meters.\n\nArea formula is A = \u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.14, so A = 3.14 \u00d7 (5)\u00b2 = 3.14 \u00d7 25 = 78.5\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of another formula for the area of a circle using diameter: A = \u03c0d\u00b2/4.\n\nLet me see if that gives me the same answer.\n\nUsing that formula:\n\nA = \u03c0d\u00b2/4 = 3.14 \u00d7 (10)\u00b2 / 4 = 3.14 \u00d7 100 / 4 = 3.14 \u00d7 25 = 78.5\n\nSame answer again. So, yeah, I'm confident now.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nMaybe using the circumference to find the area, but I don't think that's necessary here since I have the diameter and radius.\n\nAlternatively, if this were a real-world scenario, I might need to account for the depth of the pond or something, but since it's just asking for the surface area, I think area is sufficient.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are correct: since the diameter is in meters, the area will be in square meters, which matches the question's request.\n\nOne more thing: the problem specifies to use \u03c0 \u2248 3.14. I wonder if they wanted more decimal places, but no, it's clear to use 3.14.\n\nI think that's all I need to do here. The area of the pond is 78.5 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78.5} \\]"
