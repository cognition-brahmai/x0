        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a hospital studying a new surgical procedure. They're enrolling 500 patients, with 250 getting the new procedure and 250 getting the standard treatment. The new procedure takes 30 minutes longer and requires an extra surgeon who charges $500 per hour. I need to calculate the additional cost of doing the new procedure on 250 patients and then see how that compares to potential savings if the new procedure reduces postoperative complications by 10%.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the extra cost for the new procedure. The extra time is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The extra surgeon charges $500 per hour, so for 0.5 hours, that would be $500 * 0.5 = $250 per patient.\n\nSince 250 patients are getting the new procedure, the total extra cost would be 250 * $250 = $62,500.\n\nNow, I need to consider the potential savings from reducing postoperative complications by 10%. But to calculate that, I need to know what the current cost of postoperative complications is.\n\nAssuming that without the new procedure, there's a certain rate of complications, and the new procedure reduces that by 10%. To find the savings, I need to know the cost per complication.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify the current rate of complications or the cost per complication. Hmm, that's a problem. Without that information, I can't directly calculate the savings.\n\nMaybe I need to assume some values or express the savings in terms of the current complication rate and cost.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Let \\( r \\) be the rate of postoperative complications with the standard treatment.\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the cost per complication.\n\nWith the new procedure, the complication rate is reduced by 10%, so the new rate is \\( r - 0.1r = 0.9r \\).\n\nThe reduction in complications per 250 patients is \\( 250 \\times (r - 0.9r) = 250 \\times 0.1r = 25r \\).\n\nTherefore, the savings would be \\( 25r \\times c \\).\n\nBut without knowing \\( r \\) and \\( c \\), I can't calculate a numerical value for savings.\n\nMaybe the problem expects me to express the savings in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( c \\), or perhaps it provides additional information that I've missed.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it doesn't provide any data on the current complication rate or the cost per complication. It seems like I'm stuck here without making some assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compare the additional cost to the potential savings in a general way, without specific numbers.\n\nBut that seems unsatisfying. Maybe I should consider that the savings come from avoiding complications, which have associated costs, and those costs are presumably higher than the additional cost of the procedure, otherwise, there would be no point in studying the new procedure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to get at the idea that even if the new procedure costs more upfront, the long-term savings from reduced complications could make it more cost-effective.\n\nBut again, without specific numbers, it's hard to make a quantitative comparison.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can set up an equation to find out what the cost per complication would need to be for the savings to offset the additional cost.\n\nSo, additional cost for the new procedure is $62,500.\n\nSavings from reduced complications is \\( 25r \\times c \\).\n\nTo break even, savings should equal additional cost:\n\n\\( 25r \\times c = 62,500 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( c = \\frac{62,500}{25r} = \\frac{2,500}{r} \\)\n\nSo, the cost per complication would need to be $2,500 divided by the complication rate \\( r \\) for the savings to offset the additional cost.\n\nAlternatively, if I know \\( r \\), I can plug it in to find \\( c \\), or vice versa.\n\nBut since I don't have \\( r \\), I can't proceed further.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to express the break-even cost per complication in terms of \\( r \\), as I've done.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard cost for postoperative complications that I'm supposed to use, but that seems unlikely, as costs can vary widely depending on the procedure and the complication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing some information, and I should make a reasonable assumption.\n\nFor example, if I assume that the complication rate with the standard treatment is, say, 10% (just for illustration), then \\( r = 0.1 \\), and the required \\( c \\) would be \\( \\frac{2,500}{0.1} = 25,000 \\).\n\nThat means, if each complication costs $25,000, then reducing complications by 10% would save $25,000 per patient, which, for 250 patients, would be $6,250,000, which is much higher than the additional cost of $62,500.\n\nBut that seems too high. Maybe a 10% reduction in complications wouldn't save that much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the complication rate is lower, say 5% (\\( r = 0.05 \\)), then \\( c = \\frac{2,500}{0.05} = 50,000 \\).\n\nThat seems even higher.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose that with the standard treatment, the complication rate is \\( r \\), and each complication costs \\( c \\).\n\nThen, the expected cost of complications for 250 patients is \\( 250 \\times r \\times c \\).\n\nWith the new procedure, the complication rate is \\( 0.9r \\), so the expected cost is \\( 250 \\times 0.9r \\times c \\).\n\nThe savings would be the difference:\n\n\\( 250 \\times r \\times c - 250 \\times 0.9r \\times c = 250 \\times 0.1r \\times c = 25r c \\).\n\nSo, savings = \\( 25r c \\).\n\nThe additional cost of the new procedure is $62,500.\n\nTo find out if the savings offset the additional cost, I can set up the inequality:\n\n\\( 25r c \\geq 62,500 \\).\n\nThen, \\( r c \\geq 2,500 \\).\n\nThis means that the product of the complication rate and the cost per complication needs to be at least $2,500 for the savings to offset the additional cost.\n\nAlternatively, if I know \\( r \\) and \\( c \\), I can plug them in to see if the inequality holds.\n\nBut since I don't have specific values for \\( r \\) and \\( c \\), I can't make a numerical comparison.\n\nPerhaps the problem is testing my understanding that the effectiveness of the new procedure in terms of cost savings depends on the complication rate and the cost per complication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's more information implied in the problem that I'm missing.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says \"compare it to the potential savings if the new procedure reduces postoperative complications by 10%.\"\n\nWait, reducing complications by 10% implies that if the original complication rate is \\( r \\), the new rate is \\( r - 0.1r = 0.9r \\), which is what I used earlier.\n\nBut perhaps the 10% reduction is in terms of the number of complications, not the rate.\n\nWait, no, a 10% reduction in the complication rate is the same as reducing the number of complications by 10% relative to the number of patients.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of absolute numbers.\n\nSuppose that with the standard treatment, the complication rate is \\( r \\), so the expected number of complications is \\( 250r \\).\n\nWith the new procedure, it's \\( 250 \\times 0.9r = 225r \\).\n\nThe reduction is \\( 250r - 225r = 25r \\).\n\nIf each complication costs \\( c \\), then the savings are \\( 25r c \\).\n\nAdditional cost is $62,500.\n\nSo, savings - additional cost = \\( 25r c - 62,500 \\).\n\nIf this is positive, then the new procedure is cost-effective; otherwise, it's not.\n\nBut without knowing \\( r \\) and \\( c \\), I can't determine the sign of this expression.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to express the condition for cost-effectiveness as \\( 25r c > 62,500 \\), or \\( r c > 2,500 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem provides data on the typical complication rate and cost per complication, but it doesn't.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider some realistic values for \\( r \\) and \\( c \\) to illustrate the point.\n\nFor example, if the complication rate \\( r \\) is 20% (which is 0.2), and the cost per complication \\( c \\) is $10,000, then \\( r c = 0.2 \\times 10,000 = 2,000 \\), which is less than $2,500, so the savings wouldn't offset the additional cost.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( r = 0.2 \\) and \\( c = 13,000 \\), then \\( r c = 2,600 \\), which is greater than $2,500, so the savings would offset the additional cost.\n\nBut these are just hypothetical numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the savings may or may not offset the additional cost, depending on the values of \\( r \\) and \\( c \\), and to express the condition as \\( r c > 2,500 \\).\n\nGiven that, the final answer could be that the new procedure is cost-effective if the product of the complication rate and the cost per complication exceeds $2,500.\n\nBut to present it clearly, I should box that condition.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{r c > 2500} \\]"
