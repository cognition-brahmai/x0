        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there are 12 socks in a drawer, 6 black and 6 white. I need to figure out the minimum number of socks I have to pick to guarantee that I have at least one matching pair. And I'm supposed to assume I'm picking in complete darkness, so I can't see the colors.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The goal is to guarantee a matching pair. Now, socks come in two colors here: black and white. So, a matching pair would be either two black socks or two white socks.\n\nFirst, I should think about the worst-case scenario because that's often key to these kinds of problems. What's the worst that could happen when I'm picking socks?\n\nWell, in the first pick, I could get either a black or a white sock. Let's say I pick a black one.\n\nThen, on the second pick, I could pick another black one, which would give me a matching pair right there. But that's not necessarily the worst-case scenario.\n\nAlternatively, on the second pick, I could pick a white sock. So now, I have one black and one white sock, and I don't have a matching pair yet.\n\nSo, if I pick a third sock, it could be either black or white. If it's black, it matches the first one; if it's white, it matches the second one. Either way, I get a matching pair.\n\nWait a minute, is that the minimum number? Let's see.\n\nIf I pick two socks, I could have one black and one white, no match.\n\nIf I pick three socks, then regardless of the colors, I must have at least two of the same color, right?\n\nLet me think about it differently. There are only two colors. So, if I pick more than two socks, I have to repeat a color.\n\nIn fact, this seems similar to the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have n categories (or pigeonholes) and n+1 items, at least one category must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, the categories are the colors: black and white. So, if I pick 3 socks, which is one more than the number of categories, then at least one color must have at least two socks.\n\nTherefore, picking 3 socks guarantees that I have at least one matching pair.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there isn't a way to have fewer than 3 socks and still guarantee a matching pair.\n\nIf I pick only 2 socks, it's possible to have one black and one white, no match.\n\nSo, 2 socks don't guarantee a matching pair.\n\nBut with 3 socks, no matter what, I must have at least two of the same color.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks I need to pick to guarantee at least one matching pair is 3.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let's double-check.\n\nSuppose I pick 3 socks: \n\n- Case 1: all three are black. That's a matching pair.\n\n- Case 2: two black and one white. Still have a matching pair of black.\n\n- Case 3: two white and one black. Still have a matching pair of white.\n\n- Case 4: all three are white. Matching pair.\n\nSo, in every possible scenario with 3 socks, I have at least one matching pair.\n\nWhereas with 2 socks, it's possible not to have a matching pair.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number is 3.\n\nI think that's solid. No matter how the socks are arranged, picking 3 ensures a matching pair.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
