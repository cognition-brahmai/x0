I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the official Python website. For this chatbot, we'll be using Python 3.\n\nOnce you have Python set up, you can create a new Python file for your chatbot. Let's name it `simple_chatbot.py`.\n\nNow, open this file in your favorite text editor or IDE. We'll start by writing some basic code to handle user inputs and provide responses.\n\nHere's a simple outline of what our chatbot will do:\n\n1. Greet the user with a welcome message.\n2. Respond to basic greetings like \"hello\", \"hi\", \"hey\", etc.\n3. Ask for the user's name if they greet the bot.\n4. Provide information about itself when asked.\n\nTo make this chatbot, we'll use conditional statements to check the user's input and decide how to respond.\n\nLet's start by writing the code.\n\nFirst, we'll import the necessary modules. For this simple chatbot, we don't need any external libraries, so we can proceed without imports.\n\nNext, we'll define a function to handle the chatbot's responses. This function will take the user's input as an argument and return the bot's response.\n\nHere's a basic structure:\n\n```python\ndef get_bot_response(user_input):\n    # Convert the input to lowercase for easier matching\n    user_input = user_input.lower()\n    \n    # Define greetings that the bot should respond to\n    greetings = ['hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'hi there', 'hello there']\n    \n    # Check if the user's input is a greeting\n    if user_input in greetings:\n        return \"Hello! I'm your chatbot. What's your name?\"\n    \n    # If the user has provided their name\n    elif 'my name is' in user_input:\n        # Extract the name from the input\n        name = user_input.split('my name is')[1].strip()\n        return f\"Nice to meet you, {name}!\"\n    \n    # If the user asks about the bot\n    elif 'who are you' in user_input or 'what is your name' in user_input:\n        return \"I am a simple chatbot created to assist you.\"\n    \n    # Default response for unknown inputs\n    else:\n        return \"I'm not sure how to respond to that. Please greet me or tell me your name.\"\n```\n\nNow, we need to create a loop that allows the user to keep interacting with the bot until they decide to exit.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you today?\")\n    \n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"You: \")\n        \n        if user_input.lower() in ['exit', 'quit', 'bye']:\n            print(\"Chatbot: Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        \n        response = get_bot_response(user_input)\n        print(\"Chatbot:\", response)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `main` function initializes the chatbot with a welcome message.\n- It then enters a loop where it waits for user input.\n- If the user types 'exit', 'quit', or 'bye', the loop breaks, and the chatbot says goodbye.\n- Otherwise, it calls `get_bot_response` with the user's input and prints the bot's response.\n\nThis is a very basic version of a chatbot. It can be expanded with more features and responses as per your requirements.\n\nYou can run this script in your terminal or command prompt by navigating to the directory containing `simple_chatbot.py` and typing `python simple_chatbot.py`.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with building your own chatbot! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.\n\n**Final Code**\n\n```python\ndef get_bot_response(user_input):\n    user_input = user_input.lower()\n    greetings = ['hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'hi there', 'hello there']\n    \n    if user_input in greetings:\n        return \"Hello! I'm your chatbot. What's your name?\"\n    \n    elif 'my name is' in user_input:\n        name = user_input.split('my name is')[1].strip()\n        return f\"Nice to meet you, {name}!\"\n    \n    elif 'who are you' in user_input or 'what is your name' in user_input:\n        return \"I am a simple chatbot created to assist you.\"\n    \n    else:\n        return \"I'm not sure how to respond to that. Please greet me or tell me your name.\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you today?\")\n    \n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"You: \")\n        \n        if user_input.lower() in ['exit', 'quit', 'bye']:\n            print(\"Chatbot: Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        \n        response = get_bot_response(user_input)\n        print(\"Chatbot:\", response)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- **get_bot_response function**: This function processes the user's input and generates an appropriate response based on predefined conditions.\n- **main function**: This function handles the interaction loop, prompting the user for input and displaying the bot's responses until the user decides to exit."
