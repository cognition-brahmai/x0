        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many units are produced in one week. Since the factory produces 250 units every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total units produced in a week by multiplying 250 by 7.\n\nSo, 250 units/day * 7 days/week = 1750 units/week.\n\nNext, we know that each unit weighs 12 kilograms. To find the total weight in kilograms for the week, we multiply the number of units produced in a week by the weight per unit.\n\nThat would be 1750 units * 12 kg/unit = 21,000 kg.\n\nNow, we need to convert kilograms to tons. The note says that 1 ton equals 1000 kilograms. So, to find out how many tons are in 21,000 kilograms, we divide 21,000 by 1000.\n\n21,000 kg / 1000 kg/ton = 21 tons.\n\nSo, the factory produces 21 tons of the product in one week.\n\nBut let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again:\n\nDaily production: 250 units\n\nWeight per unit: 12 kg\n\nDays in a week: 7\n\nFirst, total units per week: 250 * 7 = 1750 units\n\nTotal weight in kg: 1750 * 12 = 21,000 kg\n\nConvert to tons: 21,000 / 1000 = 21 tons\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this differently. Maybe find out how much is produced in tons per day and then multiply by 7.\n\nLet's see:\n\nDaily production in kg: 250 units * 12 kg/unit = 3,000 kg\n\nConvert to tons: 3,000 kg / 1000 = 3 tons per day\n\nThen, for a week: 3 tons/day * 7 days/week = 21 tons/week\n\nSame answer again. So, I'm confident it's 21 tons.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the weekly production in units and then convert directly to tons.\n\nTotal units per week: 250 units/day * 7 days = 1750 units\n\nTotal weight: 1750 units * 12 kg/unit = 21,000 kg\n\n21,000 kg / 1000 = 21 tons\n\n\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\u5355\u4f4d\u6362\u7b97\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u30021\u5428\u7b49\u4e8e1000\u5343\u514b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u56fd\u9645\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c21,000\u5343\u514b\u9664\u4ee51000\u786e\u5b9e\u7b49\u4e8e21\u5428\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u9898\u76ee\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u201ceach unit weighs 12 kilograms\u201d\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u91cd\u91cf\u90fd\u662f\u5747\u5300\u7684\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u53d8\u5f02\u3002\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u91cd\u91cf\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u90fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u91cd12\u5343\u514b\u3002\n\n\u518d\u8005\uff0c\u9898\u76ee\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u201c1\u5428=1000\u5343\u514b\u201d\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u56fd\u5bb6\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u516c\u5236\u5355\u4f4d\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c\u6709\u77ed\u5428\uff082000\u78c5\uff09\u548c\u957f\u5428\uff082240\u78c5\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u9898\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f\u516c\u5236\u5428\uff0c\u53731\u5428=1000\u5343\u514b\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f21\u5428\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
