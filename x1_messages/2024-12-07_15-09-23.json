        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we have a factory that produces two types of products: product A and product B. Every day, it makes 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B. The selling price for each unit of product A is $20, and for product B, it's $30. We need to find out the total revenue after 10 days.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the daily revenue from each product and then sum them up to get the total daily revenue. After that, multiplying by 10 should give me the revenue for 10 days.\n\nSo, for product A:\n\nNumber of units per day: 500\n\nSelling price per unit: $20\n\nDaily revenue from product A: 500 * $20 = $10,000\n\nSimilarly, for product B:\n\nNumber of units per day: 300\n\nSelling price per unit: $30\n\nDaily revenue from product B: 300 * $30 = $9,000\n\nNow, total daily revenue from both products: $10,000 (from A) + $9,000 (from B) = $19,000\n\nTo find the revenue after 10 days: $19,000 * 10 = $190,000\n\nWait a minute, does that seem right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with product A:\n\n500 units * $20/unit = $10,000 per day\n\nProduct B:\n\n300 units * $30/unit = $9,000 per day\n\nTotal daily revenue: $10,000 + $9,000 = $19,000\n\nOver 10 days: $19,000 * 10 = $190,000\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could calculate the total units produced in 10 days and then multiply by their respective prices.\n\nLet's try that method to confirm.\n\nTotal units of product A in 10 days: 500 units/day * 10 days = 5,000 units\n\nTotal revenue from product A: 5,000 units * $20/unit = $100,000\n\nTotal units of product B in 10 days: 300 units/day * 10 days = 3,000 units\n\nTotal revenue from product B: 3,000 units * $30/unit = $90,000\n\nTotal revenue from both products: $100,000 + $90,000 = $190,000\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that $190,000 is the correct total revenue after 10 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{190000} \\]"
