        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about eyes colors in a group of people. So, there are 80 people in total, and they're divided into three groups based on eye color: brown, blue, and green. The percentages are 40% brown, 35% blue, and 25% green.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many people have brown eyes and how many have blue eyes. Then, I'll subtract the number of blue-eyed people from the number of brown-eyed people to find out how many more have brown eyes than blue eyes.\n\nAlright, starting with the brown-eyed people. 40% of 80 people have brown eyes. To find out how many that is, I can calculate 40% of 80.\n\nI know that percent means per hundred, so 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4. So, 0.4 times 80 should give me the number of brown-eyed people.\n\nLet me do the math: 0.4 \u00d7 80 = 32. So, there are 32 people with brown eyes.\n\nNext, for the blue-eyed people, it's 35% of 80. Similarly, 35% is 35/100 or 0.35. So, 0.35 times 80 should give me the number of blue-eyed people.\n\nCalculating that: 0.35 \u00d7 80 = 28. So, there are 28 people with blue eyes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more people have brown eyes than blue eyes, I subtract the number of blue-eyed people from the number of brown-eyed people: 32 - 28 = 4.\n\nSo, there are 4 more people with brown eyes than blue eyes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of people is 80. Brown eyes are 40%, which is 32 people. Blue eyes are 35%, which is 28 people. The difference is indeed 4 people.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let's check the green-eyed people. The remaining 25% have green eyes. So, 25% of 80 is 0.25 \u00d7 80 = 20 people. Adding them up: 32 (brown) + 28 (blue) + 20 (green) = 80, which matches the total number of people. So, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4 more people have brown eyes than blue eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
