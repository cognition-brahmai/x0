        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. I need to find out the probability that the sum of two fair six-sided dice equals 7. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst things first, when you roll two dice, each die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6. Since the dice are fair, each face has an equal chance of landing face up. Because there are two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 times 6, which is 36. So, there are 36 possible combinations of numbers that can come up when you roll two dice.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 36 combinations add up to 7. Let's list them out to make sure I don't miss any.\n\nStarting with the first die showing 1: if die one is 1, then die two would have to be 6 to make the sum 7 (1+6=7).\n\nNext, die one shows 2: die two would need to be 5 (2+5=7).\n\nDie one shows 3: die two is 4 (3+4=7).\n\nDie one shows 4: die two is 3 (4+3=7).\n\nWait, that's interesting. Earlier, I had 3+4=7, and now 4+3=7. These are two different outcomes because the dice are distinct. So, even though the numbers are the same, the order matters in terms of the dice being separate entities.\n\nContinuing:\n\nDie one shows 5: die two is 2 (5+2=7).\n\nDie one shows 6: die two is 1 (6+1=7).\n\nSo, in total, I have six combinations that result in a sum of 7:\n\n(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1).\n\nTherefore, there are 6 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes.\n\nTo find the probability, I divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that's 6 divided by 36, which simplifies to 1/6.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check my list to make sure I didn't miss any combinations or count any extra.\n\nLet's list all possible pairs where the sum is 7:\n\n- Die 1: 1, Die 2: 6 \u2192 sum is 7\n\n- Die 1: 2, Die 2: 5 \u2192 sum is 7\n\n- Die 1: 3, Die 2: 4 \u2192 sum is 7\n\n- Die 1: 4, Die 2: 3 \u2192 sum is 7\n\n- Die 1: 5, Die 2: 2 \u2192 sum is 7\n\n- Die 1: 6, Die 2: 1 \u2192 sum is 7\n\nYeah, that's all of them. No duplicates, no misses. So, 6 favorable outcomes.\n\nTotal possible outcomes are 36, as each die has 6 faces, and the dice are independent of each other.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of fractions. Each die is independent, so the probability of any specific pair occurring is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n\nSince there are 6 favorable pairs, the total probability is 6 * (1/36) = 1/6.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that no matter what the first die shows, there's only one number on the second die that will make the sum equal to 7.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If die one is 1, die two must be 6.\n\n- If die one is 2, die two must be 5.\n\n- And so on, up to die one being 6, die two must be 1.\n\nSince there are 6 possible values for die one, and for each value, only one corresponding value of die two will make the sum 7, the probability is 6 * (1/6 * 1/6) = 1/6.\n\nWait, I just repeated that. But it's good to confirm it the same way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the possible sums and see how many ways each sum can occur.\n\nThe possible sums range from 2 (1+1) to 12 (6+6).\n\nLet's list out the number of ways to get each sum:\n\n- Sum of 2: only (1,1) \u2192 1 way\n\n- Sum of 3: (1,2), (2,1) \u2192 2 ways\n\n- Sum of 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) \u2192 3 ways\n\n- Sum of 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) \u2192 4 ways\n\n- Sum of 6: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1) \u2192 5 ways\n\n- Sum of 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \u2192 6 ways\n\n- Sum of 8: (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2) \u2192 5 ways\n\n- Sum of 9: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) \u2192 4 ways\n\n- Sum of 10: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) \u2192 3 ways\n\n- Sum of 11: (5,6), (6,5) \u2192 2 ways\n\n- Sum of 12: (6,6) \u2192 1 way\n\nSo, indeed, sum of 7 has the most possibilities, with 6 ways.\n\nTotal number of outcomes is 36, and number of ways to get 7 is 6, so probability is 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, some people might think that since 7 is the most likely sum, the probability is higher. But in reality, while it's the most probable sum, its probability is still just 1/6.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that for any given value of the first die, there's exactly one value of the second die that makes the sum 7. Since the first die can be anything (probability 1), and the second die has a 1/6 chance of being the right number to make the sum 7, the overall probability is 1 * 1/6 = 1/6.\n\nWait, that's a bit hand-wavy, but it arrives at the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, using conditional probability: the probability that the sum is 7 is equal to the probability that the second die is the number that makes the sum 7, given the first die's value.\n\nSince the first die's value doesn't affect the second die (they are independent), the probability remains 1/6.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I keep arriving at 1/6.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, if the dice were weighted or something, but the problem states they are fair dice.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the dice are distinct. If they were indistinct, the number of possible outcomes would be different, but since they are fair and six-sided, and we're dealing with ordered pairs, the total number of outcomes is 36.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the dice are being rolled simultaneously or sequentially, but since the dice are independent, the order doesn't matter.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability that the sum of two fair six-sided dice equals 7 is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
