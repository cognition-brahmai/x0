Key individuals involved were Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, who were part of the NASA Apollo 11 mission. Armstrong famously said, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" as he became the first person to walk on the lunar surface.\n\n- **Voyager 1 Launch (1977)**: Launched by NASA in 1977, Voyager 1 is a space probe that has traveled farther than any other human-made object. It was designed to study the outer Solar System and has since entered interstellar space. Key figures include scientist Carl Sagan, who played a role in selecting the Voyager Golden Record, a message for potential extraterrestrial life.\n\n- **International Space Station (ISS) Assembly Begins (1998)**: The ISS is a modular space station in low Earth orbit, serving as a research laboratory and international collaboration project. Its assembly began in 1998 with the launch of Zarya, a Russian module. Notable astronauts and cosmonauts have spent extended periods aboard the ISS, conducting scientific experiments and advancing our understanding of life in space. Key contributors include NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA."
