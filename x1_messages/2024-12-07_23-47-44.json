        "content": "So I've got this problem about a city's public transportation system trying to optimize its bus routes. There are currently 50 buses running on 10 different routes, and each route requires 5 buses to maintain the desired frequency of service. The total daily ridership across all routes is 25,000 passengers, and I need to find the average number of passengers per bus.\n\nFirst, to find the average number of passengers per bus, I should divide the total daily ridership by the total number of buses in operation. So, that's 25,000 passengers divided by 50 buses. Let me do that calculation:\n\n25,000 passengers \u00f7 50 buses = 500 passengers per bus.\n\nSo, on average, each bus carries 500 passengers per day.\n\nNow, the city plans to add two new routes, which will require an additional 10 buses. So, the total number of buses will increase to:\n\n50 existing buses + 10 new buses = 60 buses.\n\nAdditionally, the overall daily ridership is expected to increase by 20%. So, I need to calculate what 20% of the current ridership is and add that to the current total to find the new total daily ridership.\n\nFirst, find 20% of 25,000:\n\n20% of 25,000 = 0.20 \u00d7 25,000 = 5,000 passengers.\n\nSo, the new total daily ridership will be:\n\n25,000 + 5,000 = 30,000 passengers.\n\nNow, with 60 buses and 30,000 passengers, the new average number of passengers per bus would be:\n\n30,000 passengers \u00f7 60 buses = 500 passengers per bus.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as before. How can that be? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nOriginal average: 25,000 \u00f7 50 = 500 passengers per bus.\n\nNew total ridership: 25,000 + 5,000 = 30,000 passengers.\n\nNew total buses: 50 + 10 = 60 buses.\n\nNew average: 30,000 \u00f7 60 = 500 passengers per bus.\n\nSo, the average remains the same at 500 passengers per bus.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider how the additional routes might affect ridership differently. Maybe the 20% increase isn't distributed evenly across all buses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a assumption that the additional routes will attract more passengers proportional to the number of additional buses.\n\nWait, let's think about it differently. Maybe the 20% increase is proportional to the increase in the number of buses.\n\nThe number of buses is increasing by 10 out of 50, which is 20%. So, if buses increase by 20% and ridership increases by 20%, the average passengers per bus should remain the same.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The percentage increase in buses and ridership is the same, so the average should stay constant.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe the new routes are more or less efficient in terms of passenger attraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current average is not uniform across all routes.\n\nBut based on the information given, I think assuming a uniform distribution is the best approach.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the average number of passengers per bus remains the same at 500 passengers per bus after adding the two new routes and increasing the ridership by 20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]\n"
