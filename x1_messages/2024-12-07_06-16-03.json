        "content": "Let's see. So, the car travels at 40 mph for the first half of its journey and then speeds up to 60 mph for the second half. I need to find the average speed for the entire trip. Hmm, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time, right?\n\nSo, let me assume the total distance is D miles. That means each half of the journey is D/2 miles.\n\nFirst half:\n\nDistance: D/2 miles\n\nSpeed: 40 mph\n\nTime: time = distance / speed, so time1 = (D/2) / 40 = D/(2*40) = D/80 hours\n\nSecond half:\n\nDistance: D/2 miles\n\nSpeed: 60 mph\n\nTime: time2 = (D/2) / 60 = D/(2*60) = D/120 hours\n\nTotal time: time1 + time2 = D/80 + D/120\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 80 and 120 is 240.\n\nSo, D/80 = (3D)/240\n\nAnd D/120 = (2D)/240\n\nTotal time = (3D + 2D)/240 = 5D/240 = D/48 hours\n\nTotal distance: D miles\n\nAverage speed: total distance / total time = D / (D/48) = 48 mph\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But I've heard that average speed isn't always just the average of the two speeds. In this case, since the distances are equal, maybe there's a different way to calculate it.\n\nLet me check another approach. If the distances are equal, maybe there's a formula for average speed when distances are the same but speeds are different.\n\nI think there is a formula for the average speed when traveling equal distances at different speeds. It should be the harmonic mean or something like that.\n\nLet me recall: for two speeds and equal distances, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nThe harmonic mean of two speeds, S1 and S2, is given by 2*(S1*S2)/(S1 + S2)\n\nSo, plugging in S1 = 40 mph and S2 = 60 mph:\n\nAverage speed = 2*(40*60)/(40 + 60) = 2*(2400)/100 = 4800/100 = 48 mph\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the average speed for the entire journey is 48 mph.\n\nBut wait a minute, if the car travels the first half at 40 mph and the second half at 60 mph, why isn't the average speed just (40 + 60)/2 = 50 mph?\n\nAh, that's a common mistake. The average speed isn't simply the arithmetic mean of the two speeds because the time spent at each speed is different. Since the car spends more time at the slower speed (40 mph), the average speed ends up being closer to the slower speed.\n\nIn this case, the car travels half the distance at 40 mph and half at 60 mph, so the average speed is 48 mph, not 50 mph.\n\nLet me think of another way to confirm this. Suppose the total distance is 80 miles.\n\nFirst half: 40 miles at 40 mph \u2192 time = 1 hour\n\nSecond half: 40 miles at 60 mph \u2192 time = 40/60 = 2/3 hours \u2248 0.6667 hours\n\nTotal time = 1 + 0.6667 = 1.6667 hours\n\nTotal distance = 80 miles\n\nAverage speed = 80 / 1.6667 \u2248 48 mph\n\nYes, that matches again.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for average speed when distances are equal:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * S1 * S2) / (S1 + S2) = (2 * 40 * 60) / (40 + 60) = (4800) / (100) = 48 mph\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same conclusion: the average speed is 48 mph.\n\nI think that's correct. Thank you for the question!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48 \\text{ mph}} \\]"
