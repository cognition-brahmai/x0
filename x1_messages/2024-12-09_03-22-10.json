        "content": "To convert the average distance from miles to kilometers, we need to use the conversion factor between miles and kilometers. The standard conversion factor is:\n\n1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers\n\nGiven that the Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of approximately 93 million miles, we can calculate the distance in kilometers by multiplying the number of miles by the conversion factor.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given distance in miles:\n\nDistance in miles = 93,000,000 miles\n\nNow, we'll multiply this by the conversion factor:\n\nDistance in kilometers = Distance in miles \u00d7 Conversion factor\nDistance in kilometers = 93,000,000 miles \u00d7 1.60934 kilometers/mile\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n\nDistance in kilometers = 93,000,000 \u00d7 1.60934\nDistance in kilometers = 149,668,020 kilometers\n\nTherefore, the average distance from the Earth to the Sun is approximately 149,668,020 kilometers.\n\nIt's worth noting that this value is often approximated to 149.6 million kilometers or simply 150 million kilometers in many scientific contexts. The exact average distance is defined as one astronomical unit (AU), which is approximately 149,597,870 kilometers. However, for most practical purposes, using 149.6 million kilometers is sufficient.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: The Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of approximately 149,668,020 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{149668020 \\text{ kilometers}} \\]"
