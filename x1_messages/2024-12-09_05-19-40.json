        "content": "So, if a restaurant serves 200 customers per day on average, and each customer spends $25 on their meal, and the restaurant operates 365 days a year, we can calculate the annual revenue by multiplying these numbers together.\n\nFirst, let's find out the daily revenue. That would be the number of customers per day times the average spending per customer. So, 200 customers/day times $25/customer equals $5,000/day.\n\nNext, to find the annual revenue, we'll multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a year the restaurant operates. Since it's 365 days a year, it would be $5,000/day times 365 days/year.\n\nLet me do the math: $5,000 multiplied by 365 is $1,825,000.\n\nSo, the restaurant's annual revenue would be $1,825,000.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some other factors to consider. For example, are there any holidays or closures that might reduce the number of operating days? Or perhaps there are peak seasons where the restaurant serves more customers and off-peak seasons with fewer customers.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, assuming the restaurant operates every day of the year without any variations in customer traffic, the annual revenue would be $1,825,000.\n\nIt's also important to consider that this is a straightforward calculation without factoring in costs, profits, or other financial aspects. If we were to analyze the restaurant's financial health, we'd need to look into expenses like ingredients, labor, rent, utilities, and so on.\n\nBut for the purpose of this question, which is simply to find the annual revenue, $1,825,000 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1825000} \\]"
