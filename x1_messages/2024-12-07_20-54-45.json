        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 100 units of product A every day. So from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days, right? So for product A, it would be 100 units/day times 5 days, which is 500 units.\n\nNow, starting on Monday, they also start producing product B at a rate of 50 units per day. So product B is also produced from Monday to Friday, which is also 5 days. So for product B, it's 50 units/day times 5 days, which is 250 units.\n\nTo find out the total units of both products by Friday, I need to add the units of product A and product B together. So that's 500 units of A plus 250 units of B, which equals 750 units in total.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. The factory was already producing product A before, and starting Monday, it adds product B. So from Monday to Friday, both products are being produced.\n\nYes, so every day from Monday to Friday:\n\n- Product A: 100 units/day\n\n- Product B: 50 units/day\n\nSo each day, the factory produces a total of 100 + 50 = 150 units.\n\nOver 5 days, that would be 150 units/day times 5 days, which is also 750 units.\n\nWait, but in my first calculation, I added 500 and 250 to get 750, and in this way, I got the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's break it down day by day.\n\n- Monday: 100 A + 50 B = 150 units\n\n- Tuesday: 100 A + 50 B = 150 units\n\n- Wednesday: 100 A + 50 B = 150 units\n\n- Thursday: 100 A + 50 B = 150 units\n\n- Friday: 100 A + 50 B = 150 units\n\nSo, 150 units per day for 5 days is indeed 750 units.\n\nAlternatively, you could calculate the total units of A and B separately and then add them up, which is what I did first.\n\nEither way, the total number of units produced by Friday is 750 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{750} \\]"
