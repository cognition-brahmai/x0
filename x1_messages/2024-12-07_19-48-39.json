        "content": "The chemical element with the symbol K on the periodic table is potassium. The symbol \"K\" comes from the Latin word \"kalium,\" which was derived from the arabic word \"al qali,\" meaning \"alkali,\" as potassium is a key component in alkali substances. Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element that belongs to the alkali metal group. It is highly reactive and readily reacts with water, air, and other elements. Potassium plays a vital role in various biological processes, including maintaining electrolyte balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction. It is commonly found in minerals such as sylvite (potassium chloride) and is essential for plant growth and human nutrition."
