        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a box with 12 balls in total, some of which are white and some are black. The problem states that if you pick two balls at random, the probability of getting one white and one black ball is 1/2. We need to figure out how many white balls are in the box.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic probability concepts. When dealing with combinations, the probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 12 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12!}{2!(12-2)!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 possible ways to choose 2 balls from 12.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of white balls as \\( w \\) and the number of black balls as \\( b \\). Since there are only white and black balls, we have:\n\n\\[\nw + b = 12\n\\]\n\nThe problem is asking for the number of white balls (\\( w \\)), so we'll need to express everything in terms of \\( w \\), or find an equation that allows us to solve for \\( w \\).\n\nThe event of interest is picking one white ball and one black ball. The number of ways to pick one white and one black ball is the product of the number of white balls and the number of black balls, because for each white ball, there are \\( b \\) black balls that can be paired with it, and vice versa. However, since the order in which we pick the balls doesn't matter (it's a combination, not a permutation), we can calculate it as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable combinations} = w \\times b\n\\]\n\nBut wait, since picking a white ball first and then a black ball is considered the same as picking a black ball first and then a white ball when we're dealing with combinations, we don't need to double-count. So, the formula \\( w \\times b \\) actually represents the number of ordered pairs, but in combinations, order doesn't matter. However, in the context of probability with combinations, the formula \\( w \\times b \\) divided by the total number of combinations (\\( \\binom{12}{2} \\)) is correct for the probability of picking one white and one black ball.\n\nGiven that the probability of this event is 1/2, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{w \\times b}{\\binom{12}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( \\binom{12}{2} \\) that we calculated earlier:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{w \\times b}{66} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( w \\times b \\):\n\n\\[\nw \\times b = 66 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 33\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\nw \\times b = 33\n\\]\n\nBut remember, we also have:\n\n\\[\nw + b = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( w + b = 12 \\)\n\n2. \\( w \\times b = 33 \\)\n\nThis is a system of equations that we can solve for \\( w \\) and \\( b \\). Let's solve equation 1 for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = 12 - w\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( b \\) into equation 2:\n\n\\[\nw \\times (12 - w) = 33\n\\]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n\\[\n12w - w^2 = 33\n\\]\n\nLet's rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation form:\n\n\\[\n-w^2 + 12w - 33 = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1 to make the \\( w^2 \\) term positive:\n\n\\[\nw^2 - 12w + 33 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we'll solve this quadratic equation for \\( w \\). We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nIn this equation, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -12 \\), and \\( c = 33 \\). Plugging these values in:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 33}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 132}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{12} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 3} = 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{12 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 6 \\pm \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, this gives us:\n\n\\[\nw = 6 + \\sqrt{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad w = 6 - \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nBut \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) is approximately 1.732, so:\n\n\\[\nw \\approx 6 + 1.732 = 7.732 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad w \\approx 6 - 1.732 = 4.268\n\\]\n\nHowever, the number of white balls must be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a ball. This suggests that our initial approach might have a flaw.\n\nLet me revisit our steps. We had:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{w \\times b}{66} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nLeading to:\n\n\\[\nw \\times b = 33\n\\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[\nw + b = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, we're looking for two integers \\( w \\) and \\( b \\) such that their product is 33 and their sum is 12.\n\nLet's list the pairs of integers that multiply to 33:\n\n- 1 and 33\n\n- 3 and 11\n\n- (-1) and (-33)\n\n- (-3) and (-11)\n\nBut since the number of balls can't be negative, we can disregard the negative pairs. Now, let's see which of these pairs add up to 12.\n\n- 1 + 33 = 34 \u2260 12\n\n- 3 + 11 = 14 \u2260 12\n\nHmm, neither of these pairs adds up to 12. This suggests that there might be no integer solutions for \\( w \\) and \\( b \\) that satisfy both equations, which would mean there's no solution to the problem as stated.\n\nBut that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let's double-check the probability calculation.\n\nThe probability of picking one white and one black ball can also be calculated using probabilities of sequences. For example, the probability of picking a white ball first and then a black ball, plus the probability of picking a black ball first and then a white ball.\n\nThe probability of picking a white ball first is \\( \\frac{w}{12} \\), and then picking a black ball is \\( \\frac{b}{11} \\), since one white ball has already been picked. Similarly, the probability of picking a black ball first is \\( \\frac{b}{12} \\), and then picking a white ball is \\( \\frac{w}{11} \\).\n\nSo, the total probability of picking one white and one black ball is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\left( \\frac{w}{12} \\times \\frac{b}{11} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{b}{12} \\times \\frac{w}{11} \\right) = 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{w \\times b}{12 \\times 11} \\right) = \\frac{2wb}{132} = \\frac{wb}{66}\n\\]\n\nThis matches what we had earlier. So, the equation \\( \\frac{wb}{66} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) is correct.\n\nGiven that \\( w + b = 12 \\) and \\( wb = 33 \\), and considering that \\( w \\) and \\( b \\) must be integers, it seems there's no solution because no integer pairs satisfying \\( w + b = 12 \\) also satisfy \\( wb = 33 \\).\n\nWait a second, maybe I should consider that the number of white balls could be a non-integer, but that doesn't make sense in reality since we can't have a fraction of a ball. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is considered without replacement, and maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me try another approach using combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 12 is \\( \\binom{12}{2} = 66 \\), as we calculated before.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one white and one black ball is \\( \\binom{w}{1} \\times \\binom{b}{1} = w \\times b \\).\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{w \\times b}{66} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhich again leads us to:\n\n\\[\nw \\times b = 33\n\\]\n\nWith \\( w + b = 12 \\).\n\nLet me see if there are any fractional solutions that make sense in some abstract way, but in reality, the number of balls should be integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the possibility of having non-integer numbers of balls, which doesn't make practical sense, but mathematically, it's possible.\n\nGiven that, the solutions we found are \\( w = 6 + \\sqrt{3} \\) and \\( w = 6 - \\sqrt{3} \\), which are approximately 7.732 and 4.268, respectively.\n\nBut again, this doesn't make sense in the context of counting balls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming that the order doesn't matter. Let's consider the permutations instead of combinations.\n\nIf we consider permutations, the total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 12 is \\( P(12, 2) = 12 \\times 11 = 132 \\).\n\nThe number of ways to pick one white and one black ball, considering order, is \\( w \\times b + b \\times w = 2wb \\).\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{2wb}{132} = \\frac{wb}{66} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhich again leads us to \\( wb = 33 \\).\n\nSo, regardless of whether we use combinations or permutations, we end up with the same equation.\n\nGiven that, and considering that \\( w \\) and \\( b \\) must be integers, it seems there's no solution to the problem as stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the possibility of having more than 12 balls, or some other scenario, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, and the total number of balls is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is not exactly 1/2, but close to it, and we're to find the integer values of \\( w \\) and \\( b \\) that make the probability closest to 1/2.\n\nBut the problem states that the probability is exactly 1/2.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that there are no integer solutions for \\( w \\) and \\( b \\) that satisfy both \\( w + b = 12 \\) and \\( wb = 33 \\), it seems there might be an error in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted in a different way, such as allowing for replacement of the balls, but that also doesn't seem to fit the context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to maximize or minimize the number of white balls given the probability condition, but again, the problem seems to be asking for a specific number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved using generating functions or some other method, but that seems overly complicated for this scenario.\n\nGiven all this, I'm inclined to conclude that there is no integer solution for the number of white balls that satisfies the given conditions, which suggests that the problem may have been misstated or that there's a misunderstanding in the approach.\n\nHowever, if we were to consider non-integer solutions, then \\( w = 6 + \\sqrt{3} \\) and \\( w = 6 - \\sqrt{3} \\) would be the answers, but again, that doesn't make sense in the context of counting balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the quadratic formula, and the answer is to be expressed in terms of square roots, but that also doesn't align with the expectation of an integer number of balls.\n\nGiven all of this, I think the most reasonable conclusion is that there is no integer solution for the number of white balls that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the problem as stated has no solution in the context of integer numbers of balls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No integer solution exists.}} \\]"
