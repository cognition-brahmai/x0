        "content": "So, the coffee shop serves 80 cups of coffee every hour. They're open for 8 hours each day and 7 days a week. I need to find out how many cups they serve in a whole week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cups they serve in one day. Since they serve 80 cups per hour and are open for 8 hours a day, I can multiply 80 by 8 to get the daily total.\n\n80 cups/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day = 640 cups/day\n\nSo, they serve 640 cups each day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly total, I need to multiply the daily total by the number of days they're open in a week. They're open 7 days a week, so:\n\n640 cups/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 4480 cups/week\n\nTherefore, the coffee shop serves 4,480 cups of coffee in a week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the total number of hours they're open in a week and then multiply that by the number of cups served per hour.\n\nThey're open 8 hours a day for 7 days, so:\n\n8 hours/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 56 hours/week\n\nNow, multiplying the total hours per week by the number of cups per hour:\n\n56 hours/week \u00d7 80 cups/hour = 4,480 cups/week\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, 4,480 cups per week seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this total. For example, are there any holidays or closing days that might reduce the number of hours or days they're open? The problem says they're open 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, so no, they're open every day.\n\nAlso, it assumes that the rate of coffee sales is constant throughout the week, which may not be the case in reality, but based on the information provided, we have to assume that.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4,480 cups per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4480} \\]"
