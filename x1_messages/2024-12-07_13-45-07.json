        "content": "So, Jack and Lily went on a family vacation and collected seashells at the beach. Jack collected 10 small shells, and Lily collected 5 large shells. Their mom collected all the shells and sorted them into two jars: one for small shells and one for large shells.\n\nNow, when Jack and Lily want to show their grandparents their collections, they need to know which jar to look in and how many shells they should expect to find.\n\nFirst, let's figure out which jar each sibling should look in.\n\nJack collected small shells, so he should look in the jar for small shells. Lily collected large shells, so she should look in the jar for large shells.\n\nNext, let's determine how many shells each should expect to find in their respective jars.\n\nJack collected 10 small shells, and since all the small shells are in the small shell jar, he should expect to find his 10 small shells there.\n\nLily collected 5 large shells, and since all the large shells are in the large shell jar, she should expect to find her 5 large shells there.\n\nIt's important to note that the jars are sorted based on the size of the shells, not who collected them. So, even if there were shells collected by other family members, they would be sorted into the appropriate jars based on their size.\n\nBut in this scenario, only Jack and Lily collected shells, and their mom sorted them accordingly.\n\nTherefore, Jack should look in the small shell jar and expect to find his 10 small shells, and Lily should look in the large shell jar and expect to find her 5 large shells.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Jack should look in the small shell jar for his 10 small shells, and Lily should look in the large shell jar for her 5 large shells.}} \\]"
