        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: \"If every person in a room shakes hands with every other person exactly once, and there were a total of 45 handshakes, how many people are in the room?\" Hmm, okay, so this sounds like a combinatorics problem. I need to figure out how many people would result in 45 handshakes if each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\n\nFirst, I should recall how to calculate the number of handshakes in such a scenario. If there are n people in the room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, then the total number of handshakes is given by the combination formula for choosing 2 people out of n, which is C(n, 2). The formula for C(n, 2) is n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, I have the equation:\n\nn(n-1)/2 = 45\n\nI need to solve for n.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn(n-1) = 90\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation:\n\nn\u00b2 - n - 90 = 0\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation for n. I can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -90 and add up to -1. Let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of 90 are:\n\n1 and 90\n\n2 and 45\n\n3 and 30\n\n5 and 18\n\n6 and 15\n\n9 and 10\n\nNow, considering the signs, I need one positive and one negative number that multiply to -90 and add up to -1.\n\nLooking at the pairs:\n\nIf I take 10 and -9:\n\n10 * -9 = -90\n\n10 + (-9) = 1, which is not -1.\n\nWhat about -10 and 9:\n\n-10 * 9 = -90\n\n-10 + 9 = -1, which is what I need.\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(n - 10)(n + 9) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives me:\n\nn - 10 = 0 => n = 10\n\nn + 9 = 0 => n = -9\n\nBut n represents the number of people, which can't be negative, so n = 10.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe I can use the quadratic formula to verify.\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 360)] / 2\n\nWait, let's compute the discriminant:\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n\nHere, a = 1, b = -1, c = -90\n\nSo, D = (-1)\u00b2 - 4(1)(-90) = 1 + 360 = 361\n\n\u221a361 = 19\n\nSo, n = [1 \u00b1 19]/2\n\nn = (1 + 19)/2 = 20/2 = 10\n\nn = (1 - 19)/2 = -18/2 = -9\n\nAgain, n = 10 is the valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the sum of an arithmetic series. Each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, so the first person shakes hands with n-1 people, the second with n-2 (since they've already shaken hands with the first), and so on, down to the last person who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they've already shaken hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is:\n\n(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 + 0\n\nThis is the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, which is (n-1)n/2.\n\nWait, that's the same as C(n, 2), which is consistent with what I had earlier.\n\nSo, again, (n-1)n/2 = 45\n\nSolving for n gives n\u00b2 - n - 90 = 0, leading to n = 10.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using permutations instead of combinations. But no, handshakes are combinations because the order doesn't matter. A handshake between person A and person B is the same as between person B and person A.\n\nAlternatively, I could try plugging in values for n to see which one gives 45 handshakes.\n\nLet's try n = 10:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10*9/2 = 90/2 = 45. Okay, that matches.\n\nWhat about n = 9:\n\nC(9, 2) = 9*8/2 = 72/2 = 36, which is less than 45.\n\nn = 10 gives exactly 45, as required.\n\nn = 11:\n\nC(11, 2) = 11*10/2 = 55, which is more than 45.\n\nSo, n = 10 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it graph theory terms, where each person is a vertex and each handshake is an edge. The problem then becomes finding the number of vertices in a complete graph with 45 edges.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nAgain, this brings me back to the same equation: n(n-1)/2 = 45.\n\nSolving as before, n\u00b2 - n - 90 = 0, leading to n = 10.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently from different angles.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are 10 people in the room.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
