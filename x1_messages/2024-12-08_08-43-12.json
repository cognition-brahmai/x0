        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A farmer has a rectangular field that's 100 meters by 70 meters, and he wants to divide it into square plots of equal size with no land left over. I need to figure out the largest possible size for each square plot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The field is rectangular, and its dimensions are 100 meters in one direction and 70 meters in the other. The farmer wants to divide this field into squares that are all the same size, and he doesn't want any land left over. That means the squares have to fit perfectly into the rectangle without any leftover space.\n\nSo, the key here is to find the largest possible square that can fit into both dimensions of the rectangle. In other words, the side length of the square has to be a divisor of both 100 meters and 70 meters.\n\nWait a minute, a divisor? Yes, that makes sense. If the side length of the square is a divisor of both 100 and 70, then the squares will fit perfectly into the rectangle without any leftover space.\n\nSo, I need to find the largest number that divides both 100 and 70 evenly. I think that's called the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 70.\n\nLet me recall, the GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the GCD of 100 and 70.\n\nHow do I find the GCD of two numbers? I remember there's a method called the Euclidean algorithm. Let me try that.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller number and then replacing the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder. You repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nLet's apply that here.\n\nFirst, divide 100 by 70.\n\n100 divided by 70 is 1, with a remainder of 30.\n\nNow, take 70 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 30.\n\n70 divided by 30 is 2, with a remainder of 10.\n\nNext, take 30 and divide it by 10.\n\n30 divided by 10 is 3, with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is 10. Therefore, the GCD of 100 and 70 is 10.\n\nSo, the largest possible size for each square plot is 10 meters by 10 meters.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that this makes sense.\n\nIf the field is 100 meters by 70 meters, and I divide it into squares of 10 meters on each side, how many squares would there be?\n\nAlong the 100-meter side, 100 divided by 10 is 10 squares.\n\nAlong the 70-meter side, 70 divided by 10 is 7 squares.\n\nSo, overall, there would be 10 times 7, which is 70 squares.\n\nAnd since 10 is the GCD of 100 and 70, there shouldn't be any leftover land.\n\nLet me verify if there's any other larger square that could fit.\n\nSuppose I try a square size of 15 meters.\n\nDoes 15 divide evenly into both 100 and 70?\n\n100 divided by 15 is approximately 6.666, which is not an integer.\n\n70 divided by 15 is approximately 4.666, which is also not an integer.\n\nSo, 15 doesn't work.\n\nWhat about 20 meters?\n\n100 divided by 20 is 5, which is an integer.\n\n70 divided by 20 is 3.5, which is not an integer.\n\nSo, 20 doesn't work.\n\nWhat about 5 meters?\n\n100 divided by 5 is 20.\n\n70 divided by 5 is 14.\n\nThat works, but 5 is smaller than 10.\n\nAnd what about 10 meters, which is the GCD.\n\nThat seems to work perfectly.\n\nI think 10 meters is indeed the largest possible square plot size that fits into both dimensions without leaving any land leftover.\n\nSo, the answer should be 10 meters by 10 meters.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any larger common divisor.\n\nFactors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nFactors of 70 are: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 70.\n\nThe common factors are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\nSo, the greatest common factor is 10.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible size for each square plot is 10 meters by 10 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
