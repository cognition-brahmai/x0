        "content": "So I have a basket with 100 apples, and I'm giving away 60% of them. I need to figure out how many apples I have left. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 60% of 100 apples is. Percentage means per hundred, so 60% is like 60 per 100. That means I'm giving away 60 apples out of 100.\n\nTo calculate it mathematically, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number to give away} = \\frac{\\text{percentage}}{100} \\times \\text{total number}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number to give away} = \\frac{60}{100} \\times 100 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, I'm giving away 60 apples.\n\nNow, to find out how many apples I have left, I subtract the number given away from the total number:\n\n\\[\n\\text{apples left} = \\text{total number} - \\text{number given away} = 100 - 60 = 40\n\\]\n\nTherefore, I have 40 apples left.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe instead of calculating the number to give away and then subtracting, I can directly calculate the percentage that I'm keeping.\n\nIf I'm giving away 60%, that means I'm keeping 40% of the apples, right? Because 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nSo, I can calculate 40% of 100 apples to find out how many I have left.\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{apples left} = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 100 = 40\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 40 apples left.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like both approaches are valid, and I can use whichever I find easier. In this case, since the numbers are straightforward, both were equally easy.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started with 100 apples, gave away 60%, which is 60 apples, and thus have 40 apples left. Alternatively, I kept 40% of the apples, which directly gives me 40 apples. Either way, 40 is the answer.\n\nI think that makes sense."
