        "content": "In the field of chemistry, basic chemistry involves the study of matter and its properties, how and why substances combine or separate to form other substances, and how substances interact with energy. Organic chemistry is a sub-discipline that focuses on the study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and synthesis of organic compounds, which contain carbon atoms. Physical chemistry, on the other hand, combines principles of physics and chemistry to understand the physical properties of molecules, the forces that act upon them, and how they interact and behave. Which branch of chemistry is primarily concerned with the study of carbon-containing compounds?\nA. Basic chemistry\nB. Inorganic chemistry\nC. Physical chemistry\nD. Biochemistry\nE. Organic chemistry"

Organic chemistry focuses specifically on the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and synthesis of organic compounds, which are compounds that contain carbon atoms. This field is distinct from inorganic chemistry, which deals with compounds that do not contain carbon, and physical chemistry, which applies principles of physics to understand chemical systems."
