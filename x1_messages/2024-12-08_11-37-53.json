        "content": "Let's see. So, the car first travels at 50 mph for 4 hours, and then it speeds up to 70 mph for another 2 hours. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nI remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I should probably calculate the total distance the car traveled and then divide it by the total time spent traveling.\n\nFirst, for the first part of the trip, at 50 mph for 4 hours, the distance would be speed times time, right? So, 50 mph times 4 hours equals 200 miles.\n\nThen, for the second part, at 70 mph for 2 hours, distance would be 70 mph times 2 hours, which is 140 miles.\n\nSo, the total distance is 200 miles plus 140 miles, which is 340 miles.\n\nNow, the total time is 4 hours plus 2 hours, which is 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, the average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 340 miles divided by 6 hours.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 340 divided by 6 is approximately 56.67 mph.\n\nSo, the car's average speed during the entire trip was about 56.67 mph.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe using the weighted average of the speeds.\n\nSo, the car spent more time at 50 mph than at 70 mph, since it traveled for 4 hours at 50 mph and only 2 hours at 70 mph.\n\nTherefore, the average speed should be closer to 50 mph than to 70 mph.\n\nLooking back at my calculation, 56.67 mph is between 50 and 70, and it makes sense that it's closer to 50 since more time was spent at that speed.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate a weighted average, it would be (50 mph * 4 hours + 70 mph * 2 hours) divided by total time, which is 6 hours.\n\nSo, (200 + 140) / 6 = 340 / 6 \u2248 56.67 mph.\n\nSame result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The total distance is indeed 340 miles, and the total time is 6 hours, so average speed is 56.67 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56.\\overline{6} \\text{ mph}} \\]"
