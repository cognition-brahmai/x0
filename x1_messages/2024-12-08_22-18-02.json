ANNOUNCER: TV`s most provocative entertainment news show starts right now. HAMMER: Hello. I`m A.J. Hammer, broadcasting tonight and every night from New York City. And where in the world is Tiger Woods? Brand-new Tiger mystery surfaced today about what`s happened to Tiger since his cheating scandal meltdown, including, is Tiger consoling himself by playing golf? And just when you thought the whole thing couldn`t get any more bizarre, it did today with Jessica Simpson, of all people, caught in the middle of the Tiger Woods mess. And let me tell you, she is furious. Yes, the brand-new developments keep on coming and keep on making for big news breaking today. MEREDITH VIEIRA, CO-ANCHOR, THE \"TODAY\" SHOW: The question a lot of people have been asking, where is he? HAMMER (voice-over): He`s not been seen in public. His famous friends complain they can`t reach him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He`s insulated. HAMMER: And SHOWBIZ TONIGHT can tell you with the Tiger Woods cheating scandal reaching a fever pitch and new reports swirling that his wife may leave him any day now, the entire world is asking, where in the world is Tiger Woods? CHARLES BARKLEY, TIGER WOODS` CLOSE FRIEND: When you have these fires in your life, as I call them, you need to talk to somebody else who is famous who have been through things in their life. HAMMER: Tiger`s close friend and confidant, basketball hall-of-famer, Charles Barkley, spoke with HLN`s \"Morning Express\" anchor, Robin Meade, on the special show \"With All Due Respect\" which airs on HLN on Sunday. Barkley says Tiger has changed his cell phone number and he`s not taking valuable advice from some of his famous friends. BARKLEY: I don`t think you can talk about it to your family and friends, because you`re family and friends - they are not famous. HAMMER: Other than two statements on his Web site admitting and apologizing for infidelities, Tiger hasn`t been heard from or seen publicly since reports of the serial cheating exploded after he smashed his car outside his home three weeks ago. \"Us Magazine\" reports today that Tiger has been playing golf by himself at night at a course near his Florida home to try to clear his head. MARVET BRITTO, CELEBRITY PUBLICIST: Tiger Woods by design has always been a fiercely private person. So I`m not surprised that in light of the gravity and thrust of this mishap that he has retreated. HAMMER: His wife, Elin Nordegren, hasn`t been saying much either. But she`s just started making a big statement of her own. This week, she`s been tooling around town without her wedding ring and seemingly making sure everyone noticed. And she reportedly plans to take their two small children to her native Sweden for the holidays without Tiger. DAVID CAPLAN, \"PEOPLE\" MAGAZINE: Friends of hers tell \"People\" that she`s still really planning to leave him. HAMMER: \"People\" magazine quotes two unnamed sources who say Elin Nordegren is planning to leave Woods. A check of court records by our sister network, CNN, found no divorce papers filed in either of their names in Orange County, Florida. But \"People`s\" David Caplan tells SHOWBIZ TONIGHT it prepares Elin is preparing for a life without Tiger. CAPLAN: By Elin stepping out and being photographed without her wedding ring, she`s sending a message that she`s coping. She`s going on with her life as best she can and that she`s being strong. Tiger, on the other hand, by not being spotted is trying to show his fans that he`s sort of taking a step back. He`s thinking. He`s collecting himself right now. HAMMER: But while Tiger quietly hides, plenty of others are stepping forward. CORI RIST, ALLEGED MISTRESS OF TIGER WOODS: It was just very comfortable. I think he was not afraid to show his affection. HAMMER: You can`t turn on the TV or go online without hearing from someone who claims to be one of Tiger`s mistresses. Now, even the woman who some say almost became Mrs. Tiger Woods is speaking out. DINA PARR, TIGER WOODS` HIGH SCHOOL GIRLFRIEND: I wasn`t surprised with the affair. I was surprised of the amount of women. And I surprised that he was able to get away with it as long as he did. HAMMER: \"E! Online\" has this explosive interview with Tiger`s long- time high school sweetheart. And she says he broke up with her by sending a handwritten letter during his freshman year at Stanford. She tells \"E! Online\" she`s not at all shocked by Tiger`s predicament. PARR: This personality trait that I started to notice in college, this kind of untouchable arrogance - it certainly seems that it`s escalated. HAMMER: So with all of these people talking smack about him, shouldn`t Tiger come out and tell his own story? Celebrity publicist, Marvet Britto, tells SHOWBIZ TONIGHT, her advice to Tiger would be to keep laying low. BRITTO: If Tiger was out addressing every allegation, many of us might argue that he wasn`t focusing on the restoration of his marriage. So in this particular instance, I think Tiger is doing what`s best for Tiger and what`s best for Elin. HAMMER: But as everyone keeps asking, \"Where in the world is Tiger Woods?\" and his mess gets even worse, it`s unclear whether this crouching Tiger will be able to stay hidden for much longer. HAMMER: And obviously, things could get even messier for Tiger Woods if his wife does step out and say she is divorcing him. But a lot of people were insisting today that Elin should actually try and make it work with Tiger. Joining me tonight in Hollywood, Carlos Diaz, a correspondent for \"Extra.\" Tonight, in New York, Cooper Lawrence, who is a psychologist and author of the book, \"The Cult of Celebrity.\" We have big news today across the land, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, we had women raising their fists in solidarity after \"People\" magazine reported that Elin plans to leave Tiger Woods. It was huge. And after all of the cheating, the claims from the alleged baker`s dozen of mistresses, it makes sense, right? Wrong. You`ve got to hear why Dr. Drew Pinsky thinks that Elin should stay with Tiger. Listen to what he told Joy Behar on her show here on HLN. DR. DREW PINSKY, PSYCHOLOGIST: We would normally advise people to stick it out. Well, that`s what we would say - JOY BEHAR, HOST, \"THE JOY BEHAR SHOW\": Why should she stick it out? Why? PINSKY: Well, a couple of reasons. One is whatever the reason was they got married for in the first place and they have a family together ... BEHAR: Yes. PINSKY: ... the reality is when the spouse in situations like this also have a lot to work on. And we bring them and get both of them engaged in treatment. They end up in a better place than they are going to be separately reenacting these things all over again with more people. HAMMER: All right. Cooper, off to you. Does that make any sense to you? Or do you think she should just dump him? COOPER LAWRENCE, PSYCHOLOGIST AND AUTHOR: You know, I`m shocked to hear Dr. Drew say that, because a lot of what he does is researched-based. And all of the latest research says that when you have children in these environments, being divorced sometimes is better than being in an environment like this. Look at her reaction. It was violent. Clearly, it`s a war zone they are living in. It`s not the best environment for these children. I`m very surprised that Dr. Drew thinks this would be a good thing for her to stay. It`s not one affair, it`s many. It`s indicative of a flaw in his personality ... HAMMER: Yes. LAWRENCE: ... that you don`t just fix. Plus, Dr. Drew knows about narcissism. He knows that people don`t get cured of narcissism. I don`t know why she should stay. HAMMER: He wrote a book on it. LAWRENCE: That`s why I`m so shocked that he would suggest that she stay. HAMMER: Well, here`s another side of that. And Carlos, my friend, I want to go to you on this. I think you made a terrific point on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT the other night, when you said, \"You know what? This marriage was likely never real. It sounds like he was probably cheating through the whole thing.\" So what would the point be of keeping it together? I`m guessing you`re not agreeing with what Dr. Drew was selling there. CARLOS DIAZ, CORRESPONDENT, \"EXTRA\": I`m confused, man. I talked to Dr. Drew several times. He`s really, really smart. And that`s one of dumbest things he`s ever said. LAWRENCE: Right. DIAZ: And if you look at the history of this - you know, I mean, the reason - it seems to me the reason Tiger married Elin is because he met her as a nanny. And he goes, \"Well, she can raise my kids,\" you know. And so they had two kids and he was never faithful to her the entire time. If they were married for 20 years and he had five years of infidelity, then I would agree with Dr. Drew. Yes, let`s make it work. But Tiger was never in this marriage. And in fact, I honestly don`t think Tiger is too unhappy right now. He`s got to be thinking to himself, \"Well, now I can just have sex with whoever I want and it`s all cool.\" HAMMER: Yes. Well, the opinion is certainly changing. Because I remember when the story first broke, there were more people saying, \"Well, maybe she should stand by him.\" But we got the SHOWBIZ TONIGHT question of the day results in late today. I must tell you, these results are powerful. Here`s what we asked - \"Tiger Woods: Should his wife forgive him?\" Only 19 percent now saying yes; 81 percent saying no. Cooper, this seems to make a lot of sense to me. What do you think? In light of these poll results, do you actually think their marriage is over? LAWRENCE: Of course, their marriage is over. And I agree, I`ve got to say, they should listen to Carlos, not Dr. Drew. But that marriage, from the beginning, was not a real marriage. It was based on like a business partnership. Why would you want to keep that together? If it was out of love and if it was out of this amazing bond they had, then you might want to find that bond again. But I mean, as Carlos was saying, from the very beginning, she was the nanny who should raise the children. And it`s all perfunctory. There was no real passion there. HAMMER: Well, Cooper, let me ask you this as a psychology professional, if for some reason, Elin did ultimately decide not to divorce Tiger, wouldn`t that set a terrible message and really set a terrible example? Not that she should be worried about that kind of stuff, but wouldn`t that be the message sent? LAWRENCE: It`s the most selfish thing she could do for those children. That is not an environment children should be growing up in, both in the fact that their marriage is based such a flimsy underpinnings, but also because it`s not a good environment for those kids to be in because they are seeing their mom not being fully loved and not being fully respected. That`s not the best environment for children. I`d be shocked if she stayed. HAMMER: Yes. And the truth is - and Carlos, you can nod in agreement with me here - we see a lot of celebrity couples divorce or not divorce, and people pay attention. And this story transcended everything at this point. Everybody is watching. I think it perhaps would a terrible message as well. Carlos Diaz, Cooper Lawrence, I do thank you both for being here. Now, you have to see more of what Tiger`s friend, Charles Barkley, has to say about Tiger`s mess. You`ve got to check out HLN`s own Robin Meade. She`s hosting \"With All Due Respect.\" It is a year-ender special like no other year-ender special, Sunday night, December 20th, 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific on HLN. Now, over to you.

And a lot more Tiger news is on the way for you tonight, like this, and this is almost nuts to me. What is Tiger`s connection to Jessica Simpson? Jessica is speaking out. You`ve got to hear what she has to say about some rumors that are flying around. HAMMER: Also, did Madonna give Kate Hudson a shoulder to cry on over A-Rod? Well, word is Kate and A-Rod are splitsville. But was Madonna really the one to console Kate? We will also have this - TEXT: Man accused of stalking Jennifer Garner arrested at her daughter`s nursery school.
