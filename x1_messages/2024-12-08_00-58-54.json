        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a room with people who speak different languages: English, French, and some speak both. Specifically, there are 6 people who speak English, 4 who speak French, and 3 who speak both languages. We need to find out how many people speak only one language.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many people speak only English and how many speak only French, and then add those two numbers together to get the total number of people who speak only one language.\n\nLet's start with English. There are 6 people who speak English, but among them, 3 also speak French. So, to find out how many people speak only English, I can subtract the number of people who speak both languages from the total number of English speakers. That would be 6 - 3 = 3 people who speak only English.\n\nNext, for French, there are 4 people who speak French, and again, 3 of them also speak English. So, similarly, the number of people who speak only French would be 4 - 3 = 1 person.\n\nNow, to find the total number of people who speak only one language, I can add the number of people who speak only English and the number of people who speak only French. That would be 3 + 1 = 4 people.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if there are any other people in the room who might not speak either English or French. The problem only mentions people who speak English, French, or both, so I assume that's the entire group. But just to be sure, maybe there are people who don't speak any of these languages, but the problem doesn't provide that information, so I'll proceed with the assumption that all people in the room speak at least one of these two languages.\n\nSo, based on this, the total number of people who speak only one language is 4.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach. I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of unique people in the room.\n\nThe total number of people who speak English or French is equal to the number who speak English plus the number who speak French minus the number who speak both, to avoid double-counting those who speak both languages.\n\nSo, total people = English speakers + French speakers - both languages speakers = 6 + 4 - 3 = 7 people.\n\nNow, out of these 7 people, 3 speak both languages, and 4 speak only one language (as calculated earlier). That adds up to 7, which matches the total number of people in the room. So, this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sets.\n\nLet E be the set of English speakers, and F be the set of French speakers.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |E| = 6\n\n- |F| = 4\n\n- |E \u2229 F| = 3\n\nWe need to find the number of people who speak only one language, which is the number of people who are in either E or F but not in both, which is |E \u222a F| - |E \u2229 F|.\n\nWait, actually, no. The number of people who speak only one language would be |E| + |F| - 2|E \u2229 F|.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- People who speak only English: |E| - |E \u2229 F| = 6 - 3 = 3\n\n- People who speak only French: |F| - |E \u2229 F| = 4 - 3 = 1\n\n- Total people who speak only one language: 3 + 1 = 4\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nTotal people = |E \u222a F| = |E| + |F| - |E \u2229 F| = 6 + 4 - 3 = 7\n\nThen, people who speak only one language = |E \u222a F| - |E \u2229 F| = 7 - 3 = 4\n\nWait, no. Actually, that would include people who speak only English, only French, and both. Subtracting |E \u2229 F| would leave us with only those who speak only one language.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Total people = people who speak only English + people who speak only French + people who speak both.\n\n- So, |E \u222a F| = (|E| - |E \u2229 F|) + (|F| - |E \u2229 F|) + |E \u2229 F| = 3 + 1 + 3 = 7\n\n- People who speak only one language = (|E| - |E \u2229 F|) + (|F| - |E \u2229 F|) = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, yes, 4 people speak only one language.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
