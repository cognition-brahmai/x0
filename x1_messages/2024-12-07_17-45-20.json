        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 50 people in a group, and among them, 30 like chocolate ice cream, 25 like vanilla ice cream, and 10 like both chocolate and vanilla. I need to find out how many people don't like either flavor. Hmm, this sounds like a classic problem in set theory, specifically dealing with subsets and overlaps.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are people who like chocolate, vanilla, both, or neither. I'm to find out how many like neither.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. I think a Venn diagram would be helpful here. I can draw two circles overlapping each other. One circle will represent people who like chocolate, and the other will represent people who like vanilla.\n\nSo, the chocolate circle has 30 people, the vanilla circle has 25, and the overlapping area, where people like both, has 10 people.\n\nNow, to find out how many people like either chocolate or vanilla or both, I need to add the number of people who like chocolate and the number who like vanilla, but subtract those who like both because they are counted in both categories.\n\nSo, the total number of people who like either chocolate or vanilla or both is:\n\n30 (chocolate) + 25 (vanilla) - 10 (both) = 45 people.\n\nSo, 45 people like either one or both flavors.\n\nNow, since there are 50 people in total, the number of people who don't like either flavor would be:\n\n50 (total people) - 45 (who like chocolate or vanilla or both) = 5 people.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any possibility that someone could like only chocolate, only vanilla, both, or neither?\n\nYes, those are the only possibilities.\n\nSo, people who like only chocolate would be:\n\n30 (chocolate) - 10 (both) = 20 people.\n\nOnly vanilla:\n\n25 (vanilla) - 10 (both) = 15 people.\n\nBoth:\n\n10 people.\n\nSo, total people who like at least one flavor:\n\n20 (only chocolate) + 15 (only vanilla) + 10 (both) = 45 people.\n\nAgain, 50 total - 45 = 5 people who don't like either.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle formula:\n\nNumber of people who like either chocolate or vanilla = number who like chocolate + number who like vanilla - number who like both.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, 30 + 25 - 10 = 45.\n\nThen, total people minus those who like at least one flavor gives those who like neither.\n\n50 - 45 = 5.\n\nYes, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I consider the number of people who like chocolate and those who like vanilla, and see how they overlap.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Total people = 50\n\n- Like chocolate = 30\n\n- Like vanilla = 25\n\n- Like both = 10\n\nSo, the number of people who like only chocolate is 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nOnly vanilla is 25 - 10 = 15.\n\nBoth is 10.\n\nSo, total people who like at least one flavor is 20 + 15 + 10 = 45.\n\nAgain, 50 - 45 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the probability or the proportion, but since we're dealing with exact numbers, it's not necessary.\n\nI could also think about it in terms of sets.\n\nLet C be the set of people who like chocolate, V be the set of people who like vanilla.\n\nWe're given:\n\nn(C) = 30\n\nn(V) = 25\n\nn(C \u2229 V) = 10\n\nWe need to find n(neither), where total number of people is 50.\n\nWe know that n(C \u222a V) = n(C) + n(V) - n(C \u2229 V) = 30 + 25 - 10 = 45.\n\nThen, n(neither) = total - n(C \u222a V) = 50 - 45 = 5.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider?\n\nWell, maybe I should consider if there's any possibility of people liking other flavors, but the question is only about chocolate and vanilla, and those who don't like either.\n\nSo, no, that's not necessary.\n\nAlso, the problem states that there are 50 people in total, and specifies the likes within that group.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider external factors.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who don't like either flavor is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
