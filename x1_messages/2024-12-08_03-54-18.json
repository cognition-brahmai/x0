        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're given some information about the age distribution in a country and we need to find the total population based on that.\n\nFirst, it says that 1/3 of the population is under 18 years old. That means if we let the total population be P, then the number of people under 18 is (1/3)P.\n\nNext, it says that 1/2 of the remaining population is between 18 and 65 years old. So, first we need to find out what the remaining population is after subtracting the under 18 group. The remaining population would be P - (1/3)P = (2/3)P.\n\nNow, half of this remaining population is between 18 and 65, so that would be (1/2)*(2/3)P = (1/3)P.\n\nThen, the rest of the population is over 65 years old. So, the population over 65 would be the total population minus those under 18 minus those between 18 and 65.\n\nThat is: Population over 65 = P - (1/3)P - (1/3)P = (1/3)P.\n\nBut wait, that seems straightforward, but the problem states that there are 12 million people over 65 years old. So, according to this, (1/3)P = 12 million.\n\nSo, to find P, we can set up the equation:\n\n(1/3)P = 12,000,000\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 3:\n\nP = 12,000,000 * 3\n\nP = 36,000,000\n\nSo, the total population is 36 million.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says that 1/3 are under 18, which is (1/3)*36,000,000 = 12,000,000.\n\nThen, the remaining population is 36,000,000 - 12,000,000 = 24,000,000.\n\nHalf of this remaining population is between 18 and 65, so (1/2)*24,000,000 = 12,000,000.\n\nThen, the rest are over 65, which is 24,000,000 - 12,000,000 = 12,000,000.\n\nYes, that matches the given information that there are 12 million people over 65.\n\nSo, the total population is 36 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36\\text{ million}} \\]"
