        "content": "Let's see. So, the regular price of one bag of candy is $4. There's a sale going on that offers a 25% discount on each bag. I need to find out how much I would pay for 6 bags with this discount.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the discount amount is per bag. A 25% discount on $4 means I need to calculate 25% of 4. To do that, I can multiply 4 by 0.25 because 25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 4 times 0.25 is 1. That means each bag has a $1 discount.\n\nNow, to find the sale price per bag, I subtract the discount from the regular price: $4 minus $1 equals $3 per bag.\n\nSince I want to buy 6 bags, I need to multiply the sale price per bag by 6.\n\nSo, $3 times 6 equals $18.\n\nTherefore, I would pay $18 for 6 bags of candy during the sale.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this to verify? Maybe I can calculate the total regular price first and then apply the discount.\n\nAlright, the regular price for 6 bags would be $4 times 6, which is $24.\n\nNow, a 25% discount on $24 would be $24 multiplied by 0.25, which is $6.\n\nSo, subtracting the discount from the total regular price: $24 minus $6 equals $18.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that a 25% discount means you're paying 75% of the original price, because 100% minus 25% is 75%.\n\nSo, 75% of $4 is $3 per bag, which is what I got before.\n\nOr, for all 6 bags, 75% of $24 would be $18.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer, which reinforces that $18 is correct.\n\nI think I've covered it thoroughly. The final answer is $18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
