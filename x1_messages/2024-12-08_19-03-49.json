        "content": "Alright, let's break this down step by step. The user has asked for a few things related to Quantum Computing: a shortened URL to the Wikipedia page, a QR code for that page, and some recent research papers on the topic. I've got a set of tools available to help me with this, so I'll need to figure out how to use them effectively.\n\nFirst, I need to get the Wikipedia page for Quantum Computing. I have a tool called Wikipedia[input] that can help with that. So, I'll use that to search for \"Quantum Computing\" and get the URL of the page.\n\nOnce I have the URL, I need to shorten it. There's a tool called URLShortener[input] that can do that for me. I'll pass the Wikipedia URL to this tool to get a shorter version.\n\nNext, I need to generate a QR code for this shortened URL. I have QRCodeGenerator[input], which can create a QR code from any input text. So, I'll input the shortened URL into this tool to get the QR code.\n\nFinally, the user wants some recent research papers on Quantum Computing. For this, I can use GoogleScholar[input], which is designed for searching academic papers and articles. I'll use this tool to search for \"recent Quantum Computing research papers\" or something similar to get the latest studies on the topic.\n\nI also have QAModel[input], which is a question-answering language model that can answer questions based on input text. I'm not sure if I need to use this right now, but maybe if I need to summarize the research papers or find specific information within them.\n\nLet me outline this plan:\n\n1. Use Wikipedia[\"Quantum Computing\"] to get the URL of the Quantum Computing page.\n\n2. Use URLShortener[Wikipedia[\"Quantum Computing\"]] to get a shortened version of the URL.\n\n3. Use QRCodeGenerator[URLShortener[Wikipedia[\"Quantum Computing\"]]] to generate a QR code for the shortened URL.\n\n4. Use GoogleScholar[\"recent Quantum Computing research papers\"] to find recent research papers on Quantum Computing.\n\n5. If needed, use QAModel to extract specific information from the research papers.\n\nI think that covers all the user's requests. Now, I'll proceed to execute this plan step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to execute Wikipedia[\"Quantum Computing\"] to get the URL.\n\n:evidence0: = Wikipedia[\"Quantum Computing\"]\n\nAssuming :evidence0: returns the URL \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing\", next I'll shorten this URL.\n\n:evidence1: = URLShortener[\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing\"]\n\nSuppose :evidence1: returns \"https://tinyurl.com/quantumcomputing\".\n\nNow, I'll generate a QR code for this shortened URL.\n\n:evidence2: = QRCodeGenerator[\"https://tinyurl.com/quantumcomputing\"]\n\nThis should give me a QR code image that links to the Wikipedia page on Quantum Computing.\n\nNext, I need to find recent research papers on Quantum Computing. I'll use GoogleScholar for this.\n\n:evidence3: = GoogleScholar[\"recent Quantum Computing research papers\"]\n\nThis should return a list of recent academic papers related to Quantum Computing.\n\nIf I need to summarize or extract specific information from these papers, I can use QAModel[input], but for now, I'll assume that providing the list of papers is sufficient.\n\nSo, compiling all this, the final answer would include:\n\n- The shortened URL for the Wikipedia page on Quantum Computing.\n\n- The QR code generated from this shortened URL.\n\n- A list of recent research papers on Quantum Computing.\n\nTherefore, the answer can be formatted as follows:\n\nAnswer: [The shortened URL is :evidence1:, the QR code is :evidence2:, and recent research papers can be found using :evidence3:.]\n\nThis should satisfy the user's request comprehensively.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\nPlan: Search for the Wikipedia page on Quantum Computing.\n\n:evidence0: = Wikipedia[\"Quantum Computing\"]\n\nPlan: Shorten the URL obtained from Wikipedia.\n\n:evidence1: = URLShortener[:evidence0:]\n\nPlan: Generate a QR code for the shortened URL.\n\n:evidence2: = QRCodeGenerator[:evidence1:]\n\nPlan: Search for recent research papers on Quantum Computing using Google Scholar.\n\n:evidence3: = GoogleScholar[\"recent Quantum Computing research papers\"]\n\nAnswer: [The shortened URL is :evidence1:, the QR code is :evidence2:, and recent research papers can be found using :evidence3:.]"
