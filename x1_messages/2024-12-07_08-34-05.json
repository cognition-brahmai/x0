        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a school election with three candidates: A, B, and C. Candidate A got 35% of the votes, candidate B got 25%, and candidate C got the remaining votes. The total number of students who voted is 800. I need to find out how many more votes candidate A received compared to candidate B.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many votes each candidate got. Since I know the percentages and the total number of votes, I can calculate the number of votes for each candidate by applying those percentages to the total votes.\n\nSo, for candidate A, who got 35% of the votes, the number of votes would be 35% of 800. Similarly, for candidate B, who got 25%, it's 25% of 800. Then, to find out how many more votes A received than B, I can subtract B's votes from A's votes.\n\nLet me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate A's votes:\n\nVotes for A = 35% of 800\n\nSimilarly, votes for B = 25% of 800\n\nThen, the difference = Votes for A - Votes for B\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, I can calculate votes for C to make sure everything adds up correctly. Since C got the remaining votes, it should be 100% - 35% - 25% = 40%. So, votes for C = 40% of 800.\n\nBut the main task is to find out how many more votes A received than B, so I'll focus on that.\n\nLet me proceed to calculate the actual numbers.\n\nFirst, 35% of 800:\n\n35% = 0.35\n\nSo, 0.35 * 800 = let's see, 0.35 times 800.\n\nWell, 0.35 times 100 is 35, so 0.35 times 800 is 35 * 8 = 280.\n\nSo, candidate A received 280 votes.\n\nNext, candidate B received 25% of 800.\n\n25% = 0.25\n\n0.25 * 800 = 0.25 times 800.\n\nSimilarly, 0.25 times 100 is 25, so 0.25 times 800 is 25 * 8 = 200.\n\nSo, candidate B received 200 votes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes A received than B, I subtract B's votes from A's votes:\n\n280 - 200 = 80\n\nSo, candidate A received 80 more votes than candidate B.\n\nJust to double-check, I can calculate C's votes to ensure everything adds up correctly.\n\nC received 40% of 800.\n\n40% = 0.40\n\n0.40 * 800 = 0.40 times 800.\n\n0.40 times 100 is 40, so 0.40 times 800 is 40 * 8 = 320.\n\nSo, candidate C received 320 votes.\n\nNow, let's add up A's, B's, and C's votes:\n\n280 + 200 + 320 = 800, which matches the total number of votes cast.\n\nTherefore, my calculations are correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is that candidate A received 80 more votes than candidate B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
