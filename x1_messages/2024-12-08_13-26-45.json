        "content": "So I need to find the volume of a cylinder that has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 10 cm. I remember that the formula for the volume of a cylinder is V equals pi times the radius squared times the height, or V = \u03c0r\u00b2h. Let me make sure I understand what each part of the formula represents.\n\nFirst, the radius is the distance from the center of the circular base to the edge. In this case, it's 4 cm. The height is the distance between the two bases, which is 10 cm here. Pi, or \u03c0, is a constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and it's approximately 3.14159.\n\nSo, to find the volume, I need to square the radius and then multiply it by pi and the height. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Square the radius.\n\nRadius (r) = 4 cm\n\nr\u00b2 = (4 cm)\u00b2 = 16 cm\u00b2\n\nStep 2: Multiply the squared radius by pi.\n\n\u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0 \u00d7 16 cm\u00b2\n\nSince \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, I can calculate this as:\n\n3.14159 \u00d7 16 cm\u00b2 = 50.26544 cm\u00b2\n\nStep 3: Multiply the result by the height.\n\nHeight (h) = 10 cm\n\nVolume (V) = \u03c0r\u00b2h = 50.26544 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 10 cm = 502.6544 cm\u00b3\n\nSo, the volume of the cylinder is approximately 502.6544 cubic centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's a more precise way to calculate this without approximating pi too early. Sometimes, it's better to keep pi as a symbol until the final step to maintain precision.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nStep 1: Square the radius.\n\nr\u00b2 = (4 cm)\u00b2 = 16 cm\u00b2\n\nStep 2: Multiply by pi.\n\n\u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0 \u00d7 16 cm\u00b2 = 16\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\nStep 3: Multiply by the height.\n\nV = 16\u03c0 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 10 cm = 160\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nNow, if I want a numerical value, I can substitute \u03c0 with its approximate value, say 3.14159.\n\nV \u2248 160 \u00d7 3.14159 cm\u00b3 = 502.6544 cm\u00b3\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. So, either way, the volume is approximately 502.6544 cubic centimeters.\n\nBut, in some cases, especially in math problems, it's acceptable to leave the answer in terms of \u03c0. So, V = 160\u03c0 cm\u00b3 could also be an acceptable answer, depending on the context.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for the area of the base and then multiplying by the height.\n\nThe base of the cylinder is a circle with radius 4 cm, so the area of the base (A) is A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0(4 cm)\u00b2 = 16\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nThen, the volume (V) is the area of the base times the height: V = A \u00d7 h = 16\u03c0 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 10 cm = 160\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nAgain, that matches what I got before.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also think about the cylinder in terms of its net shape. If I were to unfold the cylinder, I'd get a rectangle wrapped around a circle. The area of the rectangle would be the circumference of the base times the height, and then multiplying by the width (which is the thickness of the cylinder, but in this case, we're dealing with volume, not surface area.\n\nWait, that might be overcomplicating things. Maybe I should stick with the standard formula for volume.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about integrating the area of circular cross-sections along the height of the cylinder. So, if I imagine slicing the cylinder into many thin disks, each with thickness dh, and radius r, then the volume of each disk is \u03c0r\u00b2 dh, and the total volume is the integral from 0 to h of \u03c0r\u00b2 dh.\n\nSince r is constant, this simplifies to \u03c0r\u00b2 integrated from 0 to h, which is \u03c0r\u00b2 h.\n\nAgain, that brings me back to the original formula.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I end up with V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nV = \u03c0(4 cm)\u00b2(10 cm) = \u03c0(16 cm\u00b2)(10 cm) = 160\u03c0 cm\u00b3 \u2248 502.6544 cm\u00b3.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Maybe I should try plugging in the numbers in a different order to see if I get the same result.\n\nLet me try multiplying pi by the height first.\n\n\u03c0h = \u03c0 \u00d7 10 cm = 10\u03c0 cm\n\nThen multiply by r\u00b2:\n\nV = (10\u03c0 cm)(16 cm\u00b2) = 160\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr, multiply r\u00b2 by h first:\n\nr\u00b2h = (16 cm\u00b2)(10 cm) = 160 cm\u00b3\n\nThen multiply by \u03c0:\n\nV = \u03c0 \u00d7 160 cm\u00b3 = 160\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter the order of multiplication, the result is the same.\n\nI should also make sure that the units are consistent. Here, both the radius and height are in centimeters, so the volume should be in cubic centimeters, which makes sense.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\n16 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 10 cm = 160 cm\u00b3\n\nThen, 160 cm\u00b3 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2248 160 \u00d7 3.14159 = 502.6544 cm\u00b3\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I use a fraction for \u03c0, say 22/7, I can calculate it that way, but that's often less precise.\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 22/7:\n\nV = 160 \u00d7 22/7 cm\u00b3 = 3520/7 cm\u00b3 \u2248 502.8571 cm\u00b3\n\nThat's close to the previous approximation, but not as accurate as using a decimal approximation for \u03c0.\n\nIn most cases, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159 is sufficient for practical purposes.\n\nI think I've confirmed the calculation in multiple ways and the answer is consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any common mistakes to watch out for.\n\nOne common mistake is using the diameter instead of the radius. But in this problem, the radius is given as 4 cm, so I'm good there.\n\nAnother mistake could be using the wrong formula, like confusing it with the formula for the surface area or for a different shape, such as a cone or a sphere.\n\nAlso, sometimes people forget to square the radius, but I squared it correctly to get r\u00b2 = 16 cm\u00b2.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is ensuring that all measurements are in the same units. Here, both are in centimeters, so that's fine.\n\nIf the height and radius were in different units, I'd need to convert them to the same unit before calculating.\n\nAdditionally, if the cylinder were oblique, the volume formula remains the same, but since no mention is made of the cylinder being oblique, I assume it's a right cylinder.\n\nIn summary, the volume of the cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0(4 cm)\u00b2(10 cm) = 160\u03c0 cm\u00b3 \u2248 502.6544 cm\u00b3.\n\nI can also express the answer in terms of \u03c0, which might be more precise, especially if the problem doesn't specify to use a decimal approximation.\n\nSo, V = 160\u03c0 cm\u00b3 is exact, while 502.6544 cm\u00b3 is an approximation.\n\nDepending on the context, either could be acceptable.\n\nI think that covers it. If I were to explain this to someone, I'd walk them through the formula, identify what each variable represents, plug in the values step by step, and make sure to check units and common mistakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160\\pi \\text{ cm}^3 \\approx 502.6544 \\text{ cm}^3} \\]"
