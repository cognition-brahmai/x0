        "content": "So I have this problem here: a company with 12 employees wants to form a committee of 4 people, and I need to figure out how many different committees can be formed. Hmm, this sounds like a combination problem, right? Because the order in which we select the committee members doesn't matter; it's just about who is chosen, not who comes first or anything like that.\n\nOkay, so in combination problems, we use the formula for combinations, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 12, and k is 4.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12 - 4)!)\n\nFirst, I need to calculate 12 factorial, which is 12!, and that's 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. But that's a big number, and I'm going to have to divide it by 4! and 8!, so maybe there's a simpler way to compute this without calculating the full factorials.\n\nWait a minute, I remember that in combinations, a lot of the terms cancel out. So maybe I can simplify this expression before calculating it fully.\n\nLet's see, 12! is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, and 8! is 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. So, in the denominator, I have 4! which is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, and 8!.\n\nSo, C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! \u00d7 8!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (4! \u00d7 8!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / 4!\n\nBecause the 8! in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n\nNow, 4! is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\nSo, C(12, 4) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / 24.\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator: 12 \u00d7 11 = 132, times 10 is 1320, times 9 is 11880.\n\nSo, C(12, 4) = 11880 / 24.\n\nNow, 11880 divided by 24.\n\nLet me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 24 \u00d7 495 = 11880, because 24 \u00d7 500 = 12000, which is 120 more than 11880, so 24 \u00d7 495 = 11880.\n\nTherefore, 11880 / 24 = 495.\n\nSo, there are 495 different committees that can be formed from 12 employees, choosing 4 at a time.\n\nWait a second, is there another way to check this? Maybe I can use the combination formula in a different way or see if there's a pattern or something.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that combinations can also be calculated using the formula C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k). That's Pascal's identity.\n\nBut in this case, it might not be the most efficient way to calculate it, especially since I already have the straightforward formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of permutations.\n\nWait, no, in combinations, order doesn't matter, whereas in permutations, it does. Since this is a combination problem, I should stick with the combination formula.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nSo, C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! \u00d7 8!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / 24.\n\n12 \u00d7 11 = 132.\n\n132 \u00d7 10 = 1320.\n\n1320 \u00d7 9 = 11880.\n\n11880 / 24.\n\nLet's divide 11880 by 24.\n\n24 \u00d7 400 = 9600.\n\nSubtract 9600 from 11880, which gives 2280.\n\n24 \u00d7 95 = 2280.\n\nSo, 400 + 95 = 495.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the number of different committees that can be formed is 495.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{495} \\]"
