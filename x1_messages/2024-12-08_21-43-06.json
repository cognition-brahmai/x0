        "content": "So I have this problem here: If a box holds 20 marbles and I have 125 marbles, how many boxes do I need? And I need to show my working.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I have 125 marbles, and each box can hold 20 marbles. So, I need to find out how many boxes are required to hold all 125 marbles.\n\nFirst, I think I should divide the total number of marbles by the number of marbles each box can hold. So, that's 125 divided by 20.\n\nLet me do that division: 125 \u00f7 20.\n\nWell, 20 times 6 is 120, and 125 minus 120 is 5. So, 6 boxes can hold 120 marbles, and there are 5 marbles left over.\n\nBut I can't leave those 5 marbles without a box, can I? So, I need an additional box for those remaining marbles.\n\nTherefore, total boxes needed are 6 plus 1, which is 7 boxes.\n\nWait a minute, is there a mathematical way to confirm this?\n\nYes, I can use the ceiling function. Since division gives me 6.25, and I can't have a fraction of a box, I need to round up to the next whole number, which is 7.\n\nSo, boxes needed = ceiling of (125 \u00f7 20) = ceiling of 6.25 = 7 boxes.\n\nAlternatively, in programming, I might use integer division and check for remainders.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nUsing integer division: 125 \u00f7 20 = 6 boxes, with a remainder of 5 marbles.\n\nSince there's a remainder, I need an extra box.\n\nSo, boxes needed = 6 + 1 = 7 boxes.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if each box holds 20 marbles, then the number of boxes needed is the total marbles divided by the capacity per box, rounded up.\n\nThis is because even if there are leftover marbles, they still need their own box.\n\nSo, in general, for problems like this, I can use the formula:\n\nNumber of boxes = ceil(total marbles / marbles per box)\n\nIn this case, ceil(125 / 20) = ceil(6.25) = 7.\n\nAlternatively, using only integer arithmetic:\n\nNumber of boxes = (total marbles / marbles per box) + (remainder ? 1 : 0)\n\nWhere remainder is the result of total marbles % marbles per box.\n\nSo, 125 / 20 = 6, with a remainder of 5.\n\nSince remainder is not zero, add 1, so 6 + 1 = 7 boxes.\n\nYes, all these methods lead to the same conclusion: I need 7 boxes to hold 125 marbles, with each box holding 20 marbles.\n\nLet me double-check with smaller numbers to make sure this makes sense.\n\nSuppose I have 20 marbles and each box holds 20 marbles. So, 20 \u00f7 20 = 1 box. That makes sense.\n\nIf I have 21 marbles, 21 \u00f7 20 = 1.05, which would round up to 2 boxes.\n\nAlternatively, 21 / 20 = 1 with a remainder of 1, so 1 + 1 = 2 boxes.\n\nSimilarly, 40 marbles: 40 \u00f7 20 = 2 boxes.\n\n41 marbles: 41 \u00f7 20 = 2.05, rounds up to 3 boxes.\n\nWait, but with integer division, 41 / 20 = 2 with a remainder of 1, so 2 + 1 = 3 boxes.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to 125 marbles: 125 \u00f7 20 = 6 with a remainder of 5, so 6 + 1 = 7 boxes.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see how much total capacity is needed.\n\nEach box has 20 marbles worth of capacity.\n\nSo, total capacity needed is 125 marbles.\n\nTherefore, number of boxes = total capacity needed / capacity per box.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up.\n\nSo, again, that's ceil(125 / 20) = 7 boxes.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about what happens if I only use 6 boxes.\n\n6 boxes can hold 6 * 20 = 120 marbles.\n\nBut I have 125 marbles, so 125 - 120 = 5 marbles left without a box.\n\nTherefore, I need a 7th box for those remaining 5 marbles.\n\nSo, yes, 7 boxes are needed.\n\nI think this covers it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
