This roller coaster is going to be pretty big, with a track that's 3,000 feet long and a maximum height of 200 feet. Each train can hold up to 24 passengers. There are a couple of things they want to figure out: first, how much it's going to cost to build this thing, and second, how many people can ride it in an hour.\n\nAlright, let's tackle the construction cost first. The cost is $30,000 per foot of track, and the track is 3,000 feet long. So, the cost for the track alone would be 3,000 feet times $30,000 per foot. That sounds like a lot, but let's do the math:\n\n3,000 feet * $30,000/foot = $90,000,000\n\nSo, the track is going to cost $90 million. Now, they also need to buy trains. Each train costs $1 million, and they're planning to have three trains operating simultaneously. So, the cost for the trains would be:\n\n3 trains * $1,000,000/train = $3,000,000\n\nAdding that to the track cost:\n\n$90,000,000 + $3,000,000 = $93,000,000\n\nSo, the total construction cost for the roller coaster is $93 million. That's a hefty investment, but if it attracts more visitors, it might be worth it.\n\nNow, let's estimate how many passengers can ride the roller coaster in an hour. Each ride takes 2 minutes, and there are three trains operating at the same time. Each train holds 24 passengers.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many rides can happen in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and each ride takes 2 minutes. So, the number of rides per hour per train is:\n\n60 minutes / 2 minutes per ride = 30 rides per hour\n\nSince there are three trains, the total number of rides per hour is:\n\n3 trains * 30 rides per hour per train = 90 rides per hour\n\nNow, each ride accommodates 24 passengers, so the total number of passengers per hour is:\n\n90 rides per hour * 24 passengers per ride = 2,160 passengers per hour\n\nSo, the roller coaster can handle 2,160 passengers per hour.\n\nWait a minute, but is that actually possible? Let's think about it. If each ride takes 2 minutes, and the trains are operating simultaneously, then theoretically, every 2 minutes, three trains can depart, each carrying 24 passengers.\n\nSo, passengers per 2 minutes = 3 trains * 24 passengers = 72 passengers\n\nNow, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so the number of 2-minute intervals in an hour is:\n\n60 minutes / 2 minutes = 30 intervals\n\nTherefore, total passengers per hour = 30 intervals * 72 passengers per interval = 2,160 passengers\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any down time between rides, or if there's any loading/unloading time that might affect the operation. The problem says each ride takes 2 minutes, but that might include loading and unloading time.\n\nAssuming that 2 minutes is the complete cycle time per ride, including loading and unloading, then the calculation should be accurate.\n\nHowever, in reality, there might be some variability in loading and unloading times, or perhaps some maintenance needs that could reduce the number of rides per hour. But based on the information provided, we'll stick with 2,160 passengers per hour.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Construction cost: $93 million\n\n- Passengers per hour: 2,160\n\nI think that's what the theme park needs to know for their planning. Of course, there are other factors to consider, like maintenance costs, operational costs, and how many visitors the theme park gets per day, but for the purposes of this question, we've covered the construction cost and the passenger capacity per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe construction cost of the roller coaster is \\boxed{93000000} dollars, and it can accommodate \\boxed{2160} passengers per hour."
