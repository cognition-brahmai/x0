        "content": "Let's see. I need to find out how many prime numbers are there between 40 and 60. Prime numbers are those numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, I'll list out the numbers from 41 to 59 and check which ones are prime.\n\nStarting with 41:\n\n- 41 is only divisible by 1 and 41, so it's prime.\n\nNext, 42:\n\n- 42 is even, so it's divisible by 2, hence not prime.\n\n43:\n\n- 43 is only divisible by 1 and 43, so it's prime.\n\n44:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n45:\n\n- Ends with 5, divisible by 5, not prime.\n\n46:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n47:\n\n- 47 is only divisible by 1 and 47, so it's prime.\n\n48:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n49:\n\n- 49 is 7 squared, so divisible by 7, not prime.\n\n50:\n\n- Even number and ends with 0, divisible by 2 and 5, not prime.\n\n51:\n\n- 51 is divisible by 3 (3*17=51), not prime.\n\n52:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n53:\n\n- 53 is only divisible by 1 and 53, so it's prime.\n\n54:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n55:\n\n- Ends with 5, divisible by 5, not prime.\n\n56:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n57:\n\n- Divisible by 3 (3*19=57), not prime.\n\n58:\n\n- Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n\n59:\n\n- 59 is only divisible by 1 and 59, so it's prime.\n\nSo, between 40 and 60, the prime numbers are 41, 43, 47, 53, and 59. That makes a total of 5 prime numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
