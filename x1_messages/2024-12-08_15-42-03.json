        "content": "Let's see. So, there are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100, and the mayor wants to paint the house numbers using only red and blue colors. House number 1 is painted red, and he wants to make sure that every two consecutive houses have different colors. I need to figure out how many ways he can paint the remaining houses.\n\nOkay, so house 1 is red. That means house 2 has to be a different color, which is blue. Then house 3 has to be different from house 2, so red again. House 4 would then be blue, and so on. It seems like the colors alternate between red and blue as we go from house to house.\n\nSo, if house 1 is red, house 2 is blue, house 3 is red, house 4 is blue, and so on, up to house 100.\n\nWait a minute, is there any choice in this process? It seems like once the color of house 1 is fixed, the colors of all the other houses are determined because each one has to be different from the previous one.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose I have a sequence of 100 houses, and the first one is red. Then, each subsequent house must be the opposite color of the one before it. So, the second is blue, the third is red, the fourth is blue, and so on.\n\nThis pattern continues alternately until the last house. Since there are 100 houses, and the first is red, the 100th house would be blue, because 100 is even.\n\nSo, in this scenario, there's only one way to paint the houses following the given rules.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there are any other possibilities. For example, could there be a different sequence that satisfies the condition of consecutive houses having different colors, starting with house 1 as red?\n\nLet's think about it. If house 1 is red, house 2 must be blue. House 3 must be red, house 4 must be blue, and so on. It seems like there's no room for choice here; each house's color is determined by the color of the previous house.\n\nTherefore, there's only one possible way to paint all the houses under these constraints.\n\nI think that's the answer: there is only one way to paint the remaining houses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
