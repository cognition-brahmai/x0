        "content": "Let's see... There are 5 people in the room with an average age of 30 years. That means the total age of all 5 people together is 5 times 30, which is 150 years.\n\nNow, a sixth person enters the room, and the average age becomes 32 years. So, with 6 people in the room, the total age of all 6 people together would be 6 times 32, which is 192 years.\n\nTo find out how old the sixth person is, we can subtract the total age of the original 5 people from the total age of all 6 people.\n\nSo, the sixth person's age would be 192 years minus 150 years, which is 42 years.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nIf the average age of 5 people is 30, then the total age is 5 * 30 = 150 years.\n\nWhen a sixth person comes in, the average age becomes 32, so the total age is 6 * 32 = 192 years.\n\nTherefore, the sixth person's age is 192 - 150 = 42 years.\n\nYeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of the change in average.\n\nWhen the sixth person enters, the average age increases by 2 years (from 30 to 32).\n\nThis means that the sixth person's age is the new average plus the total change in age divided by the number of people.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nThe original total age is 150 years.\n\nAfter adding the sixth person, the total age is 192 years.\n\nSo, the sixth person must be 42 years old.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how much the sixth person's age affects the average.\n\nEach of the original 5 people's ages would need to increase by 2 years to reach the new average of 32.\n\nSo, the total increase in age for the 5 people is 5 * 2 = 10 years.\n\nThis increase must be contributed by the sixth person.\n\nTherefore, the sixth person's age is the new average age of 32 plus the total increase needed, which is 10 years, making it 42 years.\n\nWait, that gives the same answer.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the sixth person being 42 years old.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]"
