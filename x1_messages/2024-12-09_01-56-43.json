It was famously created by the alchemist Nicolas Flamel, who used the stone's elixir to extend his life for centuries. The stone plays a central role in the first book and film of the series, where Harry Potter and his friends must protect it from falling into the wrong hands, specifically those of the evil wizard Voldemort."
