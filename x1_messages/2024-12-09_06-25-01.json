        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are 5 houses in a row, each painted a different color: red, blue, green, yellow, or white. Each house has an owner who has a different pet: cat, dog, fish, bird, or rabbit. I need to find out which house the cat lives in based on the given clues.\n\nFirst, let's list out the houses in order:\n\nHouse 1, House 2, House 3, House 4, House 5.\n\nNow, the clues are:\n\n1. The first house is red.\n\nSo, House 1 is red.\n\n2. The second house has a dog.\n\nSo, House 2 has a dog.\n\n3. The third house is green.\n\nSo, House 3 is green.\n\n4. The blue house is next to the house with a bird.\n\nHmm, so the blue house is adjacent to the house that has a bird as a pet.\n\n5. The yellow house is not next to the house with a rabbit.\n\nSo, the yellow house is not adjacent to the house with a rabbit.\n\nAlright, let's start filling in what we know.\n\nWe know:\n\nHouse 1: Red\n\nHouse 2: Dog\n\nHouse 3: Green\n\nHouse 4: ?\n\nHouse 5: ?\n\nPets:\n\nHouse 1: ?\n\nHouse 2: Dog\n\nHouse 3: ?\n\nHouse 4: ?\n\nHouse 5: ?\n\nColors:\n\nHouse 1: Red\n\nHouse 2: ?\n\nHouse 3: Green\n\nHouse 4: ?\n\nHouse 5: ?\n\nNow, since each house has a different color, and House 1 is red and House 3 is green, House 2, 4, and 5 must be blue, yellow, or white, in some order.\n\nSimilarly, each house has a different pet, and House 2 has a dog, so House 1, 3, 4, and 5 have cat, fish, bird, and rabbit, in some order.\n\nNow, clue 4 says the blue house is next to the house with a bird.\n\nSo, the house with a bird cannot be House 1 or House 5, because they only have one neighbor each, and if blue is next to the bird house, then the bird house must have at least one neighbor that's blue.\n\nWait, actually, House 1 has House 2 as its neighbor, and House 5 has House 4 as its neighbor.\n\nBut, if the bird is in House 1, then the blue house must be House 2.\n\nSimilarly, if the bird is in House 5, then the blue house must be House 4.\n\nIf the bird is in House 2, then blue can be House 1 or House 3.\n\nBut House 1 is red, so it can't be blue. So, if bird is in House 2, blue must be House 3, but House 3 is green, so that's not possible.\n\nSimilarly, if bird is in House 3, blue can be House 2 or House 4.\n\nIf bird is in House 4, blue can be House 3 or House 5.\n\nWait, House 3 is green, so if bird is in House 4, blue must be House 5.\n\nAnd if bird is in House 5, blue must be House 4.\n\nWait, but House 4 could be blue if bird is in House 5.\n\nBut we need to consider all clues together.\n\nClue 5 says the yellow house is not next to the house with a rabbit.\n\nSo, yellow house is not adjacent to the rabbit house.\n\nLet's try to assign colors first, considering what we know.\n\nHouse 1: Red\n\nHouse 2: ?\n\nHouse 3: Green\n\nHouse 4: ?\n\nHouse 5: ?\n\nPossible colors for House 2, 4, 5: Blue, Yellow, White.\n\nNow, clue 4: Blue house is next to the house with a bird.\n\nSo, the house with a bird must have a blue neighbor.\n\nClue 5: Yellow house is not next to the house with a rabbit.\n\nLet me try to assign colors step by step.\n\nFirst, House 1 is red, House 3 is green.\n\nSo, House 2 can be blue, yellow, or white.\n\nHouse 4 can be blue, yellow, or white.\n\nHouse 5 can be blue, yellow, or white.\n\nBut, blue house is next to the house with a bird.\n\nSo, the bird house must have a blue neighbor.\n\nAlso, yellow house is not next to the rabbit house.\n\nLet's consider possible placements for blue and bird.\n\nLet me try assuming bird is in House 1.\n\nThen, blue house must be House 2.\n\nBut House 2 can be blue.\n\nSo, House 2 is blue.\n\nThen, House 1: Red, Bird.\n\nHouse 2: Blue.\n\nHouse 3: Green.\n\nHouse 4: Yellow or White.\n\nHouse 5: Yellow or White.\n\nBut, clue 5 says yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\nSo, yellow house cannot be next to rabbit house.\n\nBut right now, House 2 is blue, House 1 is bird.\n\nHouse 1 has bird, so House 2 is blue.\n\nHouse 2 has dog.\n\nHouse 3 is green.\n\nHouse 4 and 5 are yellow or white.\n\nNow, which house has rabbit?\n\nRabbit cannot be next to yellow house.\n\nBut right now, yellow could be House 4 or House 5.\n\nIf House 4 is yellow, then rabbit cannot be in House 3 or House 5.\n\nHouse 3 has green, so if House 4 is yellow, rabbit cannot be in House 3 or 5.\n\nSo, rabbit must be in House 1 or House 2.\n\nBut House 1 has bird, House 2 has dog.\n\nSo, rabbit cannot be in House 1 or 2.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if House 5 is yellow, then rabbit cannot be in House 4 or House 5.\n\nSo, rabbit must be in House 1, 2, or 3.\n\nHouse 1 has bird, House 2 has dog, House 3 is green.\n\nSo, rabbit must be in House 3.\n\nBut does that work?\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nHouse 1: Red, Bird.\n\nHouse 2: Blue, Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green, Rabbit.\n\nHouse 4: White.\n\nHouse 5: Yellow.\n\nNow, check clue 5: Yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\nHouse 5 is yellow, and House 4 is white, which is fine.\n\nHouse 3 is green, with rabbit, and House 4 is white, which is fine.\n\nBut, does this satisfy all clues?\n\nWait, clue 4: Blue house is next to the house with a bird.\n\nHouse 2 is blue, and House 1 has bird, which is adjacent.\n\nGood.\n\nClue 5: Yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\nHouse 5 is yellow, and House 4 is white, which is fine.\n\nHouse 3 is green with rabbit, not adjacent to yellow.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, we need to assign remaining pets: cat and fish.\n\nHouse 1: Bird.\n\nHouse 2: Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Rabbit.\n\nHouse 4: ?\n\nHouse 5: ?\n\nSo, House 4 and House 5 have cat and fish.\n\nBut, we need to determine which is which.\n\nWait, but the question is which house does the cat live in.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, cat could be in House 4 or House 5.\n\nBut, we need to find out exactly which one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this assumption is wrong.\n\nLet me try another possibility.\n\nAssume bird is in House 2.\n\nBut House 2 has dog, so that can't be.\n\nWait, no, each house has only one pet.\n\nWait, House 2 has dog, so bird cannot be in House 2.\n\nWait, no, the clues say House 2 has dog, so bird must be in one of the other houses.\n\nSo, bird is in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nEarlier, I assumed bird is in House 1.\n\nLet me try bird in House 3.\n\nIf bird is in House 3, which is green.\n\nThen, blue house must be next to House 3.\n\nSo, blue house is either House 2 or House 4.\n\nHouse 2 is already red, no, wait, House 1 is red.\n\nWait, no, House 1 is red, House 2 can be blue.\n\nAlternatively, House 4 can be blue.\n\nSo, blue can be House 2 or House 4.\n\nBut House 2 could be blue.\n\nWait, House 1 is red, House 2 is blue, House 3 is green, House 4 is white, House 5 is yellow.\n\nAlternatively, House 2 could be white, House 4 could be blue.\n\nWait, but if bird is in House 3, green, then blue must be next to it, so House 2 or House 4 must be blue.\n\nLet's say House 2 is blue.\n\nThen, House 4 can be white, and House 5 is yellow.\n\nNow, pets:\n\nHouse 1: ?\n\nHouse 2: Dog.\n\nHouse 3: ?\n\nHouse 4: ?\n\nHouse 5: ?\n\nBut House 3 is green, and bird is in House 3.\n\nWait, I assumed bird is in House 3.\n\nSo, House 3 has bird.\n\nThen, House 1 and House 5 have cat, fish, and rabbit.\n\nWait, no, House 1 has red, and House 2 has dog.\n\nHouse 3 has bird.\n\nHouse 4 and House 5 have cat, fish, and rabbit.\n\nWait, but there are only two pets left for House 4 and House 5.\n\nWait, no, wait, total pets are cat, dog, fish, bird, rabbit.\n\nHouse 2 has dog, House 3 has bird, so House 1, 4, 5 have cat, fish, rabbit.\n\nBut House 1 already has red, but no specific pet assigned yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider more.\n\nClue 5: Yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\nSo, yellow house cannot be next to rabbit house.\n\nIn this arrangement, House 2 is blue, House 3 is green, House 4 is white, House 5 is yellow.\n\nSo, yellow is House 5.\n\nRabbit cannot be in House 4 or House 5.\n\nSo, rabbit must be in House 1, 2, or 3.\n\nHouse 2 has dog, House 3 has bird, so rabbit must be in House 1.\n\nTherefore, House 1 has rabbit.\n\nThen, House 4 and House 5 have cat and fish.\n\nBut, which one is which?\n\nNo further clues to determine that.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, cat could be in House 4 or House 5.\n\nBut, perhaps there's another way to figure it out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bird is in House 4.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nAssume bird is in House 4.\n\nThen, blue house must be next to House 4.\n\nSo, blue is either House 3 or House 5.\n\nBut House 3 is green, so House 5 must be blue.\n\nThen, House 2 can be yellow or white.\n\nHouse 5 is blue, so House 4 is blue's neighbor, which has bird.\n\nNow, House 1 is red, House 2 is yellow or white, House 3 is green, House 4 is ?, House 5 is blue.\n\nWait, but House 4 must have bird.\n\nWait, in this assumption, bird is in House 4.\n\nSo, House 4 has bird.\n\nThen, House 5 is blue.\n\nNow, pets:\n\nHouse 1: ?\n\nHouse 2: ?\n\nHouse 3: ?\n\nHouse 4: Bird.\n\nHouse 5: ?\n\nHouse 2 has dog.\n\nSo, House 1, 3, 5 have cat, fish, rabbit.\n\nNow, clue 5: Yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\nHouse 5 is blue, so House 4 is bird, House 3 is green, House 2 is yellow or white, House 1 is red.\n\nIf House 2 is yellow, then yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\nSo, rabbit cannot be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nBut House 2 has dog, House 4 has bird, House 5 is blue.\n\nSo, rabbit must be in House 5.\n\nBut House 5 is blue, which is adjacent to House 4 with bird.\n\nWait, but yellow house is House 2, which is not next to rabbit, which is in House 5.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, House 1: ?\n\nHouse 2: Yellow, Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green.\n\nHouse 4: Bird.\n\nHouse 5: Blue, Rabbit.\n\nNow, House 1 has red, and has cat, fish, or rabbit.\n\nBut rabbit is in House 5, so House 1 has cat or fish.\n\nHouse 3 has green, and hasn't been assigned a pet yet, so it can have cat or fish.\n\nHouse 5 has blue and rabbit.\n\nWait, but earlier we assigned rabbit to House 5 based on yellow not being next to rabbit.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to double-check.\n\nWait, in this arrangement:\n\nHouse 1: Red, ?\n\nHouse 2: Yellow, Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green, ?\n\nHouse 4: Bird.\n\nHouse 5: Blue, Rabbit.\n\nNow, pets left: cat and fish.\n\nHouse 1 and House 3 can have cat and fish.\n\nBut again, no further clues to distinguish them.\n\nSo, perhaps in this arrangement, cat is in House 1 or House 3.\n\nBut the question is to find which house the cat lives in.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to consider another arrangement.\n\nLet me try assuming bird is in House 5.\n\nThen, blue house must be next to House 5.\n\nSo, blue is House 4.\n\nThen, House 2 can be yellow or white.\n\nHouse 1: Red.\n\nHouse 2: Yellow or White.\n\nHouse 3: Green.\n\nHouse 4: Blue.\n\nHouse 5: Bird.\n\nNow, pets:\n\nHouse 1: ?\n\nHouse 2: ?\n\nHouse 3: ?\n\nHouse 4: ?\n\nHouse 5: Bird.\n\nBut House 2 has dog.\n\nSo, House 1, 3, 4 have cat, fish, rabbit.\n\nNow, clue 5: Yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\nIf House 2 is yellow, then rabbit cannot be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nSo, rabbit must be in House 4.\n\nThen, House 1 and House 3 have cat and fish.\n\nSo, in this arrangement:\n\nHouse 1: Red, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 2: Yellow, Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 4: Blue, Rabbit.\n\nHouse 5: Bird.\n\nAgain, cat could be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nNo way to determine exactly which one based on the given clues.\n\nAlternatively, if House 2 is white, then House 4 is blue, House 5 is bird.\n\nThen, yellow could be House 5, but House 5 is already bird and blue.\n\nWait, no, House 5 is bird and blue.\n\nHouse 4 is blue.\n\nWait, no, if House 4 is blue, and House 5 is bird.\n\nThen, yellow could be House 2.\n\nSo, House 2 is yellow, not next to rabbit.\n\nSo, rabbit cannot be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nTherefore, rabbit must be in House 4 or House 5.\n\nBut House 5 is bird, so rabbit is in House 4.\n\nThen, House 1 and House 3 have cat and fish.\n\nAgain, no way to distinguish between them.\n\nSo, perhaps in all possible valid arrangements, cat can be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nBut the question is to find which house the cat lives in.\n\nMaybe there's only one possible arrangement.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something.\n\nLet me try to see if there are any other constraints.\n\nWait, in the first arrangement I tried, cat could be in House 4 or House 5.\n\nIn the second arrangement, cat could be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nBut the question is to find which house the cat lives in.\n\nPerhaps there is only one house where cat can be in all valid arrangements.\n\nBut in this case, it seems cat can be in different houses in different arrangements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's only one valid arrangement.\n\nLet me try to see if all arrangements are consistent.\n\nWait, in the first arrangement I tried:\n\nHouse 1: Red, Rabbit.\n\nHouse 2: Blue, Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green, Bird.\n\nHouse 4: White, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 5: Yellow, Cat or Fish.\n\nBut in this case, yellow house is House 5, not next to rabbit, which is in House 1.\n\nSo, that's fine.\n\nIn the second arrangement:\n\nHouse 1: Red, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 2: Yellow, Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 4: Blue, Rabbit.\n\nHouse 5: White, Bird.\n\nAgain, yellow house is House 2, not next to rabbit, which is in House 4.\n\nFine.\n\nSo, in both arrangements, cat can be in different houses.\n\nTherefore, based on the given clues, we cannot definitively determine which house the cat lives in.\n\nPerhaps there is missing information or I misinterpreted the clues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider more constraints.\n\nWait, let's list out all possible color assignments and pet assignments that satisfy all the clues.\n\nFirst, fixed assignments:\n\nHouse 1: Red.\n\nHouse 2: Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green.\n\nNow, colors for House 2, 4, 5: Blue, Yellow, White.\n\nPets for House 1, 3, 4, 5: Cat, Fish, Bird, Rabbit.\n\nClue 4: Blue house is next to the house with a bird.\n\nClue 5: Yellow house is not next to the house with a rabbit.\n\nLet's consider possible placements for blue and bird.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1:\n\n- Bird in House 1.\n\n- Then, blue house must be House 2.\n\n- House 2 is blue.\n\n- House 3 is green.\n\n- House 4: yellow or white.\n\n- House 5: yellow or white.\n\n- But House 2 is blue, House 1 is bird.\n\n- Clue 5: Yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\n- If House 4 is yellow, then rabbit cannot be in House 3 or House 5.\n\n- House 3 is green, has some pet.\n\n- House 5 has rabbit only if House 4 is not yellow.\n\n- Wait, need to think carefully.\n\n- House 4: if yellow, then rabbit cannot be in House 3 or House 5.\n\n- But House 3 is green, has cat or fish.\n\n- House 5: white, has cat or fish or rabbit.\n\n- Wait, but House 1 has bird, House 2 has dog, so House 3, 4, 5 have cat, fish, rabbit.\n\n- If House 4 is yellow, then rabbit cannot be in House 3 or House 5.\n\n- But House 3 is green, has cat or fish.\n\n- House 5 is white, has rabbit or fish or cat.\n\n- Wait, but rabbit cannot be in House 3 or House 5 if House 4 is yellow.\n\n- So, rabbit must be in House 1, but House 1 has bird.\n\n- Wait, no, House 1 has bird, so rabbit must be in House 4 or House 5.\n\n- But if House 4 is yellow, rabbit cannot be in House 3 or House 5.\n\n- So, rabbit must be in House 4.\n\n- Therefore, House 4 is yellow, rabbit.\n\n- House 5 is white, cat or fish.\n\n- House 3 is green, cat or fish.\n\n- So, in this scenario:\n\nHouse 1: Red, Bird.\n\nHouse 2: Blue, Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 4: Yellow, Rabbit.\n\nHouse 5: White, Cat or Fish.\n\n- But cat and fish are left for House 3 and House 5.\n\n- So, cat can be in House 3 or House 5.\n\nScenario 2:\n\n- Bird in House 4.\n\n- Then, blue house must be House 3 or House 5.\n\n- But House 3 is green, so House 5 must be blue.\n\n- House 5 is blue.\n\n- House 1: Red.\n\nHouse 2: Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green.\n\nHouse 4: Bird.\n\nHouse 5: Blue.\n\n- Now, colors:\n\nHouse 2: Yellow or White.\n\nHouse 4: Yellow or White.\n\n- Wait, House 4 has bird, and House 5 is blue.\n\n- Pets:\n\nHouse 1: Cat, Fish, or Rabbit.\n\nHouse 3: Cat, Fish, or Rabbit.\n\nHouse 5: Cat, Fish, or Rabbit.\n\n- But House 2 has dog.\n\n- Clue 5: Yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\n- If House 2 is yellow, then rabbit cannot be in House 1 or House 3.\n\n- House 1: Red, Cat, Fish, or Rabbit.\n\n- House 3: Green, Cat, Fish, or Rabbit.\n\n- House 4: Bird.\n\n- House 5: Blue, Cat, Fish, or Rabbit.\n\n- If House 2 is yellow, rabbit cannot be in House 1 or House 3.\n\n- So, rabbit must be in House 4 or House 5.\n\n- But House 4 has bird, so rabbit must be in House 5.\n\n- Then, House 5 is blue, rabbit.\n\n- House 1 and House 3 have cat and fish.\n\n- So, in this scenario:\n\nHouse 1: Red, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 2: Yellow, Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 4: Bird.\n\nHouse 5: Blue, Rabbit.\n\n- Again, cat can be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nScenario 3:\n\n- Bird in House 5.\n\n- Then, blue house must be House 4.\n\n- House 4 is blue.\n\n- House 5: Bird.\n\n- House 1: Red.\n\nHouse 2: Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green.\n\nHouse 4: Blue.\n\nHouse 5: Bird.\n\n- Colors:\n\nHouse 2: Yellow or White.\n\nHouse 3: Green.\n\n- Pets:\n\nHouse 1: Cat, Fish, Rabbit.\n\nHouse 3: Cat, Fish, Rabbit.\n\nHouse 4: Rabbit or something else.\n\n- Wait, House 4 has blue, adjacent to House 5 with bird.\n\n- Clue 5: Yellow house is not next to rabbit.\n\n- If House 2 is yellow, then rabbit cannot be in House 1 or House 3.\n\n- House 1: Red, Cat, Fish, Rabbit.\n\n- House 3: Green, Cat, Fish, Rabbit.\n\n- House 4: Blue, ?\n\n- House 5: Bird.\n\n- But House 4 cannot have bird, so perhaps rabbit is in House 4.\n\n- If House 4 is blue, and has rabbit.\n\n- Then, House 2 is yellow, dog.\n\n- Yellow house is House 2, not next to rabbit in House 4.\n\n- That works.\n\n- So, House 4: Blue, Rabbit.\n\n- House 5: Bird.\n\n- House 1 and House 3 have cat and fish.\n\n- So, in this scenario:\n\nHouse 1: Red, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 2: Yellow, Dog.\n\nHouse 3: Green, Cat or Fish.\n\nHouse 4: Blue, Rabbit.\n\nHouse 5: White, Bird.\n\n- Again, cat can be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nSo, in all valid arrangements, cat can be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nTherefore, based on the given clues, we cannot determine exactly which house the cat lives in.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cat is in the green house.\n\nWait, no, House 3 is green, and in some arrangements, cat can be in House 1, which is red.\n\nSo, cat can be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nTherefore, the cat lives in either the first or the third house.\n\nBut the question is to determine which house the cat lives in, and based on the clues, it's impossible to determine exactly which one.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the cat lives in the green house.\n\nWait, but House 3 is green, and in some arrangements, cat can be in House 1, which is red.\n\nSo, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's only one possible arrangement.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some constraints.\n\nLet me try to see if there are any other clues I can use.\n\nClue 1: First house is red.\n\nClue 2: Second house has a dog.\n\nClue 3: Third house is green.\n\nClue 4: Blue house is next to the house with a bird.\n\nClue 5: Yellow house is not next to the house with a rabbit.\n\nFrom earlier, in all valid arrangements, cat can be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nTherefore, the cat lives in either the first or the third house.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects one specific answer, and I need to find which one it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cat is in the white house.\n\nBut from the earlier arrangements, House 5 could be white, but cat could also be in House 1 or House 3, which could be red or green.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that the cat lives in the house that is neither blue nor yellow.\n\nBut that doesn't specify exactly which house.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cat lives in the house next to the dog.\n\nHouse 2 has a dog, so House 1 and House 3 are adjacent to House 2.\n\nSo, House 1 and House 3 are next to the dog.\n\nTherefore, the cat lives in a house next to the dog.\n\nBut in the earlier arrangements, cat can be in House 1 or House 3, both of which are next to House 2 with the dog.\n\nSo, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cat lives in the green house.\n\nBut House 3 is green, and in some arrangements, cat can be in House 1, which is red.\n\nSo, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cat lives in the house next to the blue house.\n\nBut in different arrangements, the blue house can be in different positions.\n\nFor example, in one arrangement, blue is House 2, in another, blue is House 4, and in another, blue is House 5.\n\nSo, depending on that, the house next to the blue house can be different.\n\nTherefore, cannot determine based on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the order of the colors or pets.\n\nWait, maybe there is a specific order that I haven't considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cat lives in the white house.\n\nBut in the earlier arrangements, House 5 could be white, but House 1 could be white as well, depending on the arrangement.\n\nWait, no, House 1 is red, House 3 is green, House 2 can be blue, yellow, or white, House 4 can be blue, yellow, or white, House 5 can be blue, yellow, or white.\n\nSo, white could be House 2, 4, or 5.\n\nAnd in some arrangements, cat could be in House 1 or House 3, which are red or green.\n\nTherefore, cat could be in a red, green, or white house, depending on the arrangement.\n\nBut, perhaps, there is only one possible arrangement where cat is in the white house.\n\nBut from earlier, it seems that cat can be in House 1 (red), House 3 (green), or House 5 (white).\n\nTherefore, cannot determine exactly which house the cat lives in.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the cat lives in the house that is not blue or yellow.\n\nBut that still leaves House 1 (red), House 3 (green), and House 5 (possibly white).\n\nTherefore, based on the given clues, it is impossible to determine exactly which house the cat lives in.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Cannot be determined}} \\]"
