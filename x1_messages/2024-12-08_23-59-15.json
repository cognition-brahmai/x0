        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 100 houses, numbered from 1 to 100, and we need to find out how many of these houses have the digit \"7\" in their number. Those houses will be painted red.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a house number to contain the digit \"7\". It means that anywhere in the number, whether in the tens place or the units place, there's a 7.\n\nSo, let's break it down by the digits. We have two-digit numbers here, from 1 to 100. But actually, numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit, and from 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 is a three-digit number.\n\nWait, but 100 is 100, which doesn't contain a 7, so we can ignore it for now.\n\nLet's consider the numbers from 1 to 99 first, and then we'll see about 100.\n\nSo, from 1 to 99, we have numbers from 00 to 99 if we consider leading zeros for single-digit numbers. But actually, house numbers start from 1, so it's from 01 to 100.\n\nBut to make it easier, let's think in terms of tens and units digits.\n\nLet's make a list:\n\n- In the tens place: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\n- In the units place: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nSo, for each tens digit, the units digit can be anything from 0 to 9.\n\nNow, we need to find all the combinations where either the tens digit is 7 or the units digit is 7 or both.\n\nOne way to approach this is to count the numbers where the tens digit is 7, count the numbers where the units digit is 7, and then subtract the overlap where both digits are 7, because we've counted those twice.\n\nSo, let's do that.\n\nFirst, numbers where the tens digit is 7:\n\nThat would be 70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79. That's 10 numbers.\n\nSecond, numbers where the units digit is 7:\n\nThat would be 7,17,27,37,47,57,67,77,87,97. That's another 10 numbers.\n\nNow, the overlap is where both digits are 7, which is 77. So, we've counted 77 in both lists, so we need to subtract one to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, total numbers with at least one 7 are:\n\n10 (from tens place) + 10 (from units place) - 1 (overlap) = 19.\n\nNow, what about house number 100? Does it contain a 7? No, it's 100, which has only 1 and 0.\n\nSo, adding that to our previous count, it remains 19.\n\nWait, but let's double-check to make sure we haven't missed any numbers.\n\nLet's list all the numbers from 1 to 100 that contain the digit 7:\n\n7,17,27,37,47,57,67,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,87,97.\n\nLet's count them:\n\n7 (1),17 (2),27 (3),37 (4),47 (5),57 (6),67 (7),70 (8),71 (9),72 (10),73 (11),74 (12),75 (13),76 (14),77 (15),78 (16),79 (17),87 (18),97 (19).\n\nYes, 19 houses.\n\nSo, the answer should be 19 houses will be painted red.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there any other number between 1 and 100 that contains the digit 7 that I might have missed?\n\nLet's think about it again.\n\nFrom 1 to 99:\n\n- Tens digit 7: 70-79 (10 numbers)\n\n- Units digit 7: 7,17,27,37,47,57,67,77,87,97 (10 numbers)\n\n- Overlap: 77 (1 number)\n\nSo, 10 + 10 - 1 = 19.\n\nAnd 100 doesn't contain a 7.\n\nSo, yes, 19 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]"
