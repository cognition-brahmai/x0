        "content": "Let's see. There are 25 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes occur in total.\n\nFirst, I think about smaller numbers to understand the pattern. For example, if there are 2 people, they would shake hands only once. So, with 2 people, there's 1 handshake.\n\nIf there are 3 people, person A shakes hands with person B and person C, and person B shakes hands with person C. So, that's 3 handshakes in total.\n\nFor 4 people, person A shakes hands with B, C, and D, person B shakes hands with C and D, and person C shakes hands with D. That adds up to 6 handshakes.\n\nWait a minute, there's probably a pattern here. Let's see:\n\n- 2 people: 1 handshake\n\n- 3 people: 3 handshakes\n\n- 4 people: 6 handshakes\n\nI notice that 1, 3, 6 are triangular numbers. Triangular numbers are sums of consecutive integers. For example:\n\n- 1 = 1\n\n- 3 = 1 + 2\n\n- 6 = 1 + 2 + 3\n\nSo, for 2 people, it's 1 handshake, which is the sum of the first 1 integer.\n\nFor 3 people, it's 3 handshakes, which is the sum of the first 2 integers.\n\nFor 4 people, it's 6 handshakes, which is the sum of the first 3 integers.\n\nFollowing this pattern, for n people, the number of handshakes would be the sum of the first (n-1) integers.\n\nSo, for 25 people, it would be the sum of the first 24 integers.\n\nI know that the sum of the first k integers is given by the formula k(k+1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for k=24, the sum is 24*25/2 = 300.\n\nSo, there would be 300 handshakes in total.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this reasoning. Maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider combinations. Each handshake is between 2 people, and the order doesn't matter. So, it's essentially choosing 2 people out of 25 to shake hands.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 people out of 25 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of people, and k is the number of people to choose.\n\nIn this case, n=25 and k=2.\n\nSo, C(25, 2) = 25! / (2!(25-2)!) = (25*24)/2 = 300.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each person shaking hands with every other person. So, the first person shakes hands with 24 others, the second person shakes hands with 23 remaining people (since they already shook hands with the first person), the third person shakes hands with 22 remaining people, and so on, until the last person, who doesn't need to shake hands with anyone because they already shook hands with everyone else.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes would be 24 + 23 + 22 + ... + 1.\n\nThis is the same as the sum of the first 24 integers, which is 24*25/2 = 300.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of double-counting or missing some handshakes.\n\nIn the combination approach, C(25, 2), we directly calculate the number of unique pairs, which avoids double-counting.\n\nIn the sum approach, by summing from 24 down to 1 and dividing by 2, we also avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 300 handshakes.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider a different example to verify.\n\nSuppose there are 5 people. According to the formula, C(5, 2) = 10 handshakes.\n\nAlternatively, sum of first 4 integers: 4+3+2+1=10.\n\nAnd indeed, if you think about it, with 5 people, each shaking hands with 4 others, but since each handshake involves 2 people, the total is 5*4/2=10.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to 25 people, it's 25*24/2=300.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 300 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
