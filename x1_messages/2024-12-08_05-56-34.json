        "content": "Let's see. There are 120 students in total. 25% play soccer, 30% play basketball, and 15% play both sports. I need to find out what percentage doesn't play either sport.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students play soccer and how many play basketball.\n\n25% of 120 students play soccer:\n\n25% of 120 = (25/100) * 120 = 30 students\n\n30% of 120 students play basketball:\n\n30% of 120 = (30/100) * 120 = 36 students\n\nNow, 15% play both soccer and basketball:\n\n15% of 120 = (15/100) * 120 = 18 students\n\nTo find out how many students play either soccer or basketball, I need to add the number of soccer and basketball players and then subtract those who play both, because they are counted in both groups.\n\nSo, total playing either soccer or basketball:\n\n= soccer players + basketball players - both\n\n= 30 + 36 - 18\n\n= 48 students\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either sport, I subtract the number of students playing either sport from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students not playing either sport:\n\n= total students - students playing either sport\n\n= 120 - 48\n\n= 72 students\n\nNow, to find the percentage of students not playing either sport:\n\n= (students not playing either sport / total students) * 100\n\n= (72 / 120) * 100\n\n= 60%\n\nSo, 60% of the students do not play either soccer or basketball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion directly with percentages.\n\nPercentage playing soccer: 25%\n\nPercentage playing basketball: 30%\n\nPercentage playing both: 15%\n\nPercentage playing either soccer or basketball:\n\n= soccer + basketball - both\n\n= 25% + 30% - 15%$\n\n= 40%\n\nTherefore, percentage not playing either sport:\n\n= 100% - 40% = 60%\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer is 60%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
