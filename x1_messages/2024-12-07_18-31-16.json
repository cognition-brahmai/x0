        "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to create a simple filesystem simulator in C++. It sounds like fun! So, the requirements are to implement basic commands like mkdir, rmdir, touch, rm, ls, and cd, and keep the filesystem structure in memory, printing the current state after each command.\n\nFirst, I need to plan how to represent the filesystem in memory. Since it's a filesystem with directories and files, a tree structure seems appropriate. Each node can represent either a directory or a file, with directories having children nodes.\n\nLet me think about the classes I'll need. I can have a base class called Node, which has common properties like name and perhaps a flag to indicate if it's a directory or a file. Then, I can have derived classes Directory and File, each adding specific functionalities.\n\nFor the filesystem, I'll need to maintain the current working directory, starting from the root. I'll need to handle paths, probably relative to the current directory.\n\nLet's sketch out the class structure:\n\n- class Node {\n\npublic:\n\nstd::string name;\n\nbool isDirectory;\n\n// Other common properties and methods\n\n};\n\n- class Directory : public Node {\n\npublic:\n\nstd::map<std::string, Node*> children;\n\n// Methods to add, remove children\n\n};\n\n- class File : public Node {\n\npublic:\n\n// File-specific properties and methods\n\n};\n\nThen, I'll need a FileSystem class to manage the overall structure, handle commands, and keep track of the current directory.\n\nI should also think about how to implement each command:\n\n- mkdir: Create a new directory inside the current directory.\n\n- rmdir: Remove an empty directory.\n\n- touch: Create a new file inside the current directory.\n\n- rm: Remove a file.\n\n- ls: List contents of the current directory.\n\n- cd: Change the current directory.\n\nI need to parse user inputs to recognize these commands and their arguments.\n\nError handling will be important, especially for operations like removing non-empty directories, removing non-existent files, changing to non-existent directories, etc.\n\nAlso, I need to print the current state of the filesystem after each command. Maybe recursively print the directory structure starting from the root.\n\nLet me start by defining the Node class and its derived classes.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement a simple filesystem simulator in C++, we need to create a program that can handle basic filesystem operations such as making directories, removing directories, creating files, removing files, listing directory contents, and changing directories. The filesystem structure will be stored in memory, and the current state will be printed after each command execution.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Class Structure:**\n   - `Node`: Base class with common properties like `name` and `isDirectory`.\n   - `Directory`: Derived from `Node`, contains a map of children nodes.\n   - `File`: Derived from `Node`, represents files.\n\n2. **FileSystem Class:**\n   - Manages the filesystem structure and handles commands.\n   - Maintains the current working directory, starting from the root.\n\n3. **Command Implementation:**\n   - `mkdir`: Create a new directory.\n   - `rmdir`: Remove an empty directory.\n   - `touch`: Create a new file.\n   - `rm`: Remove a file.\n   - `ls`: List contents of the current directory.\n   - `cd`: Change the current directory.\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - Handle operations on non-existent directories or files.\n   - Prevent removal of non-empty directories.\n\n5. **Printing the Filesystem:**\n   - Recursively print the directory structure starting from the root.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <map>\n#include <string>\n\nclass Node {\npublic:\n    std::string name;\n    bool isDirectory;\n    Node(std::string n, bool dir) : name(n), isDirectory(dir) {}\n};\n\nclass Directory : public Node {\npublic:\n    std::map<std::string, Node*> children;\n    Directory(std::string n) : Node(n, true) {}\n    ~Directory() {\n        for (auto& child : children) {\n            delete child.second;\n        }\n    }\n    Node* addNode(std::string name, bool isDir) {\n        if (children.find(name) != children.end()) {\n            return nullptr;\n        }\n        Node* node = isDir ?
