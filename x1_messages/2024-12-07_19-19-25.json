Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, I need to find the total distance and the total time.\n\nLet's find the distance for each part of the trip first.\n\nFor the first part:\n\nSpeed = 60 miles per hour\n\nTime = 2 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nFor the second part:\n\nSpeed = 40 miles per hour\n\nTime = 3 hours\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 40 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, the total distance is the sum of these two distances:\n\nTotal distance = 120 miles + 120 miles = 240 miles\n\nThe total time is the sum of the two time periods:\n\nTotal time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours\n\nNow, average speed = total distance / total time = 240 miles / 5 hours = 48 miles per hour\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me see: another way to think about average speed is to consider the harmonic mean of the speeds, but since the time intervals are different, I think the total distance divided by total time is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the time intervals were equal, I could maybe take the arithmetic mean, but that's not the case here.\n\nLet me confirm with another example. Suppose a car travels 30 miles per hour for 1 hour and then 60 miles per hour for 1 hour. The total distance would be 30 miles + 60 miles = 90 miles, and the total time is 2 hours, so average speed is 45 miles per hour.\n\nAlternatively, if it travels 30 miles per hour for 1 hour and then 60 miles per hour for 0.5 hours, the distances would be 30 miles and 30 miles, total 60 miles, total time 1.5 hours, average speed 40 miles per hour.\n\nBack to the original problem, with 120 miles at 60 mph for 2 hours and 120 miles at 40 mph for 3 hours, total 240 miles in 5 hours, average 48 mph. That seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using the concept of weighted averages? Yes, the average speed can be seen as a weighted average of the speeds, weighted by the time spent at each speed.\n\nSo, average speed = (speed1 \u00d7 time1 + speed2 \u00d7 time2) / (time1 + time2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAverage speed = (60 mph \u00d7 2 hours + 40 mph \u00d7 3 hours) / (2 hours + 3 hours) = (120 + 120) / 5 = 240 / 5 = 48 mph\n\nSame answer.\n\nWait, maybe I can also calculate it using the distances. Since distance = speed \u00d7 time, and average speed = total distance / total time.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire trip as two segments, and I need to find the overall average speed.\n\nAnother way: suppose the car travels the first 120 miles at 60 mph, taking 2 hours, and the next 120 miles at 40 mph, taking 3 hours, total time 5 hours, total distance 240 miles, average speed 48 mph.\n\nHmm, I keep getting to the same conclusion. I think 48 miles per hour is the correct average speed for the entire trip.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the car had traveled equal distances at each speed. Wait, in this case, it did travel equal distances, 120 miles each, but at different speeds.\n\nIn such cases, the average speed is not simply the arithmetic mean of the speeds, but rather the harmonic mean, because the times are different.\n\nWait, actually, for equal distances, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the speeds.\n\nLet me recall the formula for harmonic mean for two speeds over equal distances:\n\nAverage speed = (2 \u00d7 speed1 \u00d7 speed2) / (speed1 + speed2)\n\nIn this case, speed1 = 60 mph, speed2 = 40 mph\n\nSo, average speed = (2 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 40) / (60 + 40) = (4800) / (100) = 48 mph\n\nAgain, the same answer. Interesting, so both methods confirm that the average speed is 48 mph.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The average speed of the car during the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
