        "content": "Let's see. So, the car goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour and comes back at 40 miles per hour. I need to find the average speed for the whole trip.\n\nFirst, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's assume the distance from Town A to Town B is D miles. That means the total distance for the round trip is 2D miles.\n\nNow, the time taken to go from A to B at 60 mph is D divided by 60, which is D/60 hours.\n\nThe time taken to return from B to A at 40 mph is D divided by 40, which is D/40 hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is D/60 + D/40 hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.\n\nSo, D/60 is equal to 2D/120, and D/40 is equal to 3D/120.\n\nAdding them up, the total time is (2D + 3D)/120 = 5D/120 = D/24 hours.\n\nNow, the total distance is 2D miles, and the total time is D/24 hours.\n\nSo, the average speed is total distance divided by total time: 2D divided by D/24.\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 2D * 24/D.\n\nThe D's cancel out, and we get 2 * 24 = 48 miles per hour.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this?\n\nI've heard of something called the harmonic mean for average speeds when the distances are the same but the speeds are different.\n\nThe formula for the harmonic mean of two speeds is 2*(speed1*speed2)/(speed1 + speed2).\n\nPlugging in the values, it would be 2*(60*40)/(60 + 40) = 2*2400/100 = 4800/100 = 48 mph.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me try to understand why the average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean of 60 and 40, which would be 50 mph.\n\nWell, the arithmetic mean would be correct if the time spent at each speed was the same. But in this case, the car spends more time at the slower speed because it's going slower on the return trip.\n\nSo, the average speed is pulled closer to the slower speed, which makes sense because more time is spent at that speed.\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
