        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that if I roll a fair six-sided die three times, what's the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled will be exactly 10. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a fair six-sided die has sides numbered from 1 to 6, and each side has an equal chance of landing face up. Since I'm rolling it three times, I need to consider all possible outcomes of these three rolls and then figure out how many of those outcomes add up to 10.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die three times is 6 multiplied by itself three times, right? Because for each roll, there are 6 possible results, and the rolls are independent. So, 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 equals 216 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 216 outcomes sum to exactly 10. One way to approach this is to list all the possible combinations of three numbers between 1 and 6 that add up to 10. But that seems a bit tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, there's a method called \"stars and bars\" for solving problems like this, but I'm not sure if it directly applies here because the numbers on the die have a maximum limit of 6. So, I might need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me try to think of it this way: I need to find the number of integer solutions to the equation x + y + z = 10, where each variable x, y, and z is between 1 and 6, inclusive.\n\nFirst, I can make a substitution to make the variables start from 0 instead of 1. Let's set x' = x - 1, y' = y - 1, and z' = z - 1. Then, x', y', and z' are between 0 and 5, and the equation becomes:\n\n(x' + 1) + (y' + 1) + (z' + 1) = 10\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx' + y' + z' = 7\n\nNow, I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to x' + y' + z' = 7, where each variable is at most 5 (since x, y, z cannot exceed 6, and x' = x - 1, so x' \u2264 5).\n\nWithout the upper limit, the number of non-negative integer solutions would be C(7 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(9, 2) = 36, using the stars and bars theorem.\n\nBut I have to subtract the cases where one or more variables are greater than 5.\n\nLet's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, find the number of solutions where at least one variable is greater than 5. Suppose x' > 5, then let x'' = x' - 6, so x'' \u2265 0. Then the equation becomes:\n\nx'' + y' + z' = 1\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to this is C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nSimilarly, if y' > 5 or z' > 5, each would also have 3 solutions.\n\nHowever, it's not possible for two variables to both be greater than 5 because 6 + 6 = 12, and 12 > 7.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions where at least one variable is greater than 5 is 3 \u00d7 3 = 9.\n\nThus, the number of valid solutions is 36 - 9 = 27.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nTotal unrestricted solutions: C(9, 2) = 36.\n\nSolutions where one variable is greater than 5: for each variable, if x' \u2265 6, set x'' = x' - 6, then x'' + y' + z' = 1, which has C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3 solutions.\n\nSince there are three variables, total solutions where at least one variable is greater than 5 is 3 \u00d7 3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid solutions is 36 - 9 = 27.\n\nBut wait, let's verify this by listing some possibilities.\n\nPossible combinations for x', y', z' where x' + y' + z' = 7 and 0 \u2264 x', y', z' \u2264 5.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n- (5,2,0): permutations: 3! / 2! = 3 (since 2 and 0 are distinct)\n\n- (5,1,1): permutations: 3 (5 is distinct)\n\n- (4,3,0): permutations: 6\n\n- (4,2,1): permutations: 6\n\n- (3,3,1): permutations: 3\n\n- (3,2,2): permutations: 3\n\nAdding them up: 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 24.\n\nHmm, that's less than the 27 I calculated earlier. So, I must have made a mistake in my inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me re-examine the inclusion-exclusion step.\n\nTotal unrestricted solutions: C(9,2) = 36.\n\nSolutions where x' > 5: set x'' = x' - 6, then x'' + y' + z' = 1, which has C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3,2) = 3 solutions.\n\nSimilarly for y' > 5 and z' > 5.\n\nHowever, in inclusion-exclusion, we need to subtract the cases where at least one variable is greater than 5, but since it's not possible for two variables to be greater than 5 simultaneously (as 6+6=12 > 7), we don't need to add back any intersections.\n\nTherefore, the calculation should be 36 - 9 = 27.\n\nBut my manual count only gives 24. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I missed some combinations in the manual count.\n\nLet's list them again:\n\n- (5,2,0): permutations: 6 (5,2,0; 5,0,2; 2,5,0; 2,0,5; 0,5,2; 0,2,5)\n\n- (5,1,1): permutations: 3 (5,1,1; 1,5,1; 1,1,5)\n\n- (4,3,0): permutations: 6\n\n- (4,2,1): permutations: 6\n\n- (3,3,1): permutations: 3\n\n- (3,2,2): permutations: 3\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 27.\n\nWait, now it adds up to 27. Earlier I thought it was 24, but actually, it's 27. So, my inclusion-exclusion was correct, and the manual count matches.\n\nTherefore, there are 27 favorable outcomes where the sum is 10.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 27 / 216.\n\nSimplifying that fraction: 27 divided by 27 is 1, and 216 divided by 27 is 8. So, it's 1/8.\n\nWait, but 27 divided by 216 is 1/8.\n\nBut let me double-check that.\n\n27 \u00f7 216 = 0.125, which is 1/8.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/8.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a decimal or percentage, but since the question doesn't specify, I'll leave it as a fraction.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled will be exactly 10 is 1/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}} \\]"
