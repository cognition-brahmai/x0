I need to figure out how much each person owes.\n\nFirst, the bill is $60.\n\nOne friend has only $15, so he can pay $15.\n\nAnother friend says he can pay half the bill. Half of $60 is $30.\n\nThe last friend will cover the rest.\n\nSo, let's add up what the first two friends are paying: $15 + $30 = $45.\n\nThe total bill is $60, so the rest that the third friend needs to pay is $60 - $45 = $15.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check.\n\nFirst friend: $15\n\nSecond friend: $30 (half the bill)\n\nThird friend: $15 (the remaining amount)\n\nTotal: $15 + $30 + $15 = $60, which matches the bill.\n\nSo, each person owes:\n\n- First friend: $15\n\n- Second friend: $30\n\n- Third friend: $15\n\nThat seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15, 30, 15} \\]"
