Idaho is famous for its potatoes and is landlocked, sharing borders with six other U.S. states: Montana to the north and east, Wyoming to the east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the west. Additionally, it shares a small border with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north. So, Idaho fits the description of sharing borders with six states and one Canadian province."
