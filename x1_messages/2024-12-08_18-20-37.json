        "content": "So here's this problem: a dad gives his son $100 and says he can spend it however he wants, but every time he spends some money, he has to give half of what he spent back to his father. The question is, how much money could the son ultimately spend?\n\nAt first glance, it seems like the son can spend $100, give back half of that, which is $50, and then he's left with $50. But wait, he still has $50, maybe he can spend that again and give back half of that, which is $25, so he spends another $25, and now he's left with $25. He can repeat this process, spending half each time and giving back half of what he spends.\n\nSo, it seems like he can keep spending and giving back half forever, each time spending half of what he has left. This sounds like an infinite series where each term is half of the previous one.\n\nLet's try to model this mathematically. Let\u2019s denote the amount spent in each step as S1, S2, S3, ..., Sn.\n\nInitially, he has $100.\n\nFirst spend: S1 = some amount, say $x. He gives back half of S1, which is x/2, to his father. So, the remaining money is 100 - x + x/2 = 100 - x/2.\n\nSecond spend: S2 = some amount from the remaining money, say $y. He gives back y/2. Remaining money becomes (100 - x/2) - y + y/2 = 100 - x/2 - y/2.\n\nThis seems getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total amount spent is the sum of all the S_i, and each S_i has half of it given back to the father, which reduces the son's total money by only half of S_i.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as each spend costs him only half the amount he spends because he gets half back.\n\nSo, for each dollar he spends, he effectively loses only half a dollar because he gets half a dollar back.\n\nTherefore, with $100, the total amount he can spend is double the initial amount, which is $200.\n\nWait, does that make sense?\n\nLet me check with smaller numbers. Suppose he has $1.\n\nHe spends $1, gives back $0.5, so he's left with $0.5.\n\nThen he can spend $0.5, gives back $0.25, left with $0.25.\n\nThen spends $0.25, gives back $0.125, left with $0.125, and so on.\n\nThe total spent is 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ... which is a geometric series with first term a=1 and ratio r=0.5.\n\nThe sum of infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r) = 1 / (1 - 0.5) = 1 / 0.5 = 2.\n\nSo, with $1 initial, he can spend up to $2.\n\nTherefore, with $100, he can spend up to $200.\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier thought.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is that for each dollar he spends, he only reduces his net money by half a dollar because he gets half back.\n\nSo, if he spends S dollars, his net reduction is S/2 dollars.\n\nBut he starts with $100, so S/2 <= 100 => S <= 200.\n\nHence, S = $200.\n\nThis matches the earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the son can ultimately spend $200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
