        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people, and in this group, 65% are vaccinated against a certain disease. That means, naturally, that the remaining 35% are not vaccinated, right? Because 100% minus 65% vaccinated is 35% unvaccinated.\n\nNow, among those who are vaccinated, 4% still contract the disease. Similarly, among the unvaccinated, 12% contract the disease. We need to find out the overall percentage of people in the group who contract the disease, regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not.\n\nTo find this overall percentage, I think we need to calculate the weighted average of the percentages of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals who contract the disease, weighted by the proportion of each group in the total population.\n\nLet me try to write that down mathematically. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- V = percentage of vaccinated individuals = 65%\n\n- UV = percentage of unvaccinated individuals = 35%\n\n- D_V = percentage of vaccinated who contract the disease = 4%\n\n- D_UV = percentage of unvaccinated who contract the disease = 12%\n\nWe need to find the overall percentage of people who contract the disease, which I'll call D_total.\n\nI believe D_total can be calculated as:\n\nD_total = (V * D_V) + (UV * D_UV)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nD_total = (65% * 4%) + (35% * 12%)\n\nBut wait, multiplying percentages like this might be a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to convert them to decimals first for easier calculation.\n\nSo, converting percentages to decimals:\n\n- V = 65% = 0.65\n\n- UV = 35% = 0.35\n\n- D_V = 4% = 0.04\n\n- D_UV = 12% = 0.12\n\nNow, D_total = (0.65 * 0.04) + (0.35 * 0.12)\n\nLet's calculate each part:\n\nFirst part: 0.65 * 0.04 = 0.026\n\nSecond part: 0.35 * 0.12 = 0.042\n\nNow, adding them together: 0.026 + 0.042 = 0.068\n\nConverting this back to a percentage: 0.068 * 100% = 6.8%\n\nSo, the overall percentage of people in the group who contract the disease is 6.8%.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nV = 65% or 0.65\n\nUV = 35% or 0.35\n\nD_V = 4% or 0.04\n\nD_UV = 12% or 0.12\n\nD_total = (0.65 * 0.04) + (0.35 * 0.12)\n\nCalculate 0.65 * 0.04:\n\n0.65 * 0.04 = 0.026\n\nCalculate 0.35 * 0.12:\n\n0.35 * 0.12 = 0.042\n\nAdd them together:\n\n0.026 + 0.042 = 0.068\n\nConvert to percentage:\n\n0.068 * 100% = 6.8%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of actual numbers to verify. Suppose there are 1000 people in the group.\n\nNumber vaccinated: 65% of 1000 = 650 people\n\nNumber unvaccinated: 35% of 1000 = 350 people\n\nAmong vaccinated: 4% contract the disease: 4% of 650 = 0.04 * 650 = 26 people\n\nAmong unvaccinated: 12% contract the disease: 12% of 350 = 0.12 * 350 = 42 people\n\nTotal contracting the disease: 26 + 42 = 68 people\n\nOverall percentage: (68 / 1000) * 100% = 6.8%\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the overall percentage of people in the group who contract the disease is indeed 6.8%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.8\\%} \\]"
