        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. There's a group of people, and 40% of them have brown eyes while 60% have blue eyes. Then, 30% of those with brown eyes wear glasses, and 20% of those with blue eyes wear glasses. I need to find out what percentage of the entire group wears glasses.\n\nOkay, first things first. I need to understand what's being asked. It's about finding the overall percentage of people who wear glasses, considering both brown-eyed and blue-eyed people.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I believe I should consider the contributions from each eye color group separately and then sum them up to get the total percentage.\n\nSo, starting with the brown-eyed people:\n\n- 40% of the group has brown eyes.\n\n- 30% of these brown-eyed people wear glasses.\n\nSo, the percentage of the entire group that has brown eyes and wears glasses would be 40% times 30%.\n\nSimilarly, for the blue-eyed people:\n\n- 60% of the group has blue eyes.\n\n- 20% of these blue-eyed people wear glasses.\n\nSo, the percentage of the entire group that has blue eyes and wears glasses would be 60% times 20%.\n\nThen, I can add these two results together to get the total percentage of the group that wears glasses.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, for brown-eyed people:\n\n40% * 30% = ?\n\nWell, to multiply percentages, I can convert them to decimals:\n\n0.40 * 0.30 = 0.12\n\nThen, 0.12 as a percentage is 12%.\n\nNext, for blue-eyed people:\n\n60% * 20% = ?\n\nAgain, converting to decimals:\n\n0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12\n\nSo, that's another 12%.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n12% + 12% = 24%\n\nTherefore, 24% of the entire group wears glasses.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with brown-eyed people: 40% of the group, and 30% of them wear glasses. So, 0.40 * 0.30 = 0.12, which is 12%.\n\nFor blue-eyed people: 60% of the group, and 20% of them wear glasses. So, 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12, which is another 12%.\n\nTotal percentage wearing glasses: 12% + 12% = 24%.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it with actual numbers to confirm.\n\nLet's assume there are 100 people in the group for simplicity.\n\n- 40% have brown eyes: 40 people.\n\n- 60% have blue eyes: 60 people.\n\nNow, among the brown-eyed people:\n\n- 30% wear glasses: 30% of 40 is 0.30 * 40 = 12 people.\n\nAmong the blue-eyed people:\n\n- 20% wear glasses: 20% of 60 is 0.20 * 60 = 12 people.\n\nSo, total number of people wearing glasses: 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nSince the group has 100 people, 24 out of 100 is 24%.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, is there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nLet me consider the overall percentage of people wearing glasses as a weighted average of the two groups.\n\nThe weights are the proportions of brown-eyed and blue-eyed people in the group.\n\nSo, the weighted average would be:\n\n(Proportion of brown-eyed * percentage of brown-eyed wearing glasses) + (Proportion of blue-eyed * percentage of blue-eyed wearing glasses)\n\nWhich is:\n\n(0.40 * 30%) + (0.60 * 20%) = 12% + 12% = 24%\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think in terms of probability, the probability that a randomly selected person wears glasses is the sum of the probabilities of being brown-eyed and wearing glasses and being blue-eyed and wearing glasses.\n\nWhich is P(brown and glasses) + P(blue and glasses) = P(brown) * P(glasses|brown) + P(blue) * P(glasses|blue)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n0.40 * 0.30 + 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.24 or 24%\n\nOkay, I'm getting consistent results across different methods. That gives me confidence that 24% is the correct answer.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe if there were people with other eye colors, but the problem specifies only brown and blue eyes, so those are the only two groups.\n\nAlso, assuming that everyone either has brown or blue eyes, which adds up to 100%, which they do: 40% + 60% = 100%.\n\nSo, no one with other eye colors to consider.\n\nAlternatively, if there were people with other eye colors, I would need additional information about their glasses-wearing habits.\n\nBut in this case, it's just brown and blue eyes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 24%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24\\%} \\]"
