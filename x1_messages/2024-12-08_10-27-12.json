        "content": "Let's see. There are 40 students in the class, and 25% of them scored above 90 on the test. I need to find out how many students scored below or equal to 90.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students scored above 90. Since 25% of the class did that, I can calculate 25% of 40.\n\n25% of 40 is calculated as (25/100) * 40, which simplifies to 0.25 * 40 = 10 students.\n\nSo, 10 students scored above 90.\n\nNow, to find out how many scored below or equal to 90, I can subtract the number of students who scored above 90 from the total number of students.\n\nThat is, 40 - 10 = 30 students.\n\nTherefore, 30 students scored below or equal to 90.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the percentages directly.\n\nIf 25% scored above 90, then the remaining percentage must have scored below or equal to 90.\n\nSo, 100% - 25% = 75% scored below or equal to 90.\n\nThen, 75% of 40 students is (75/100) * 40 = 0.75 * 40 = 30 students.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any students who scored exactly 90. But the question says \"below or equal to 90,\" so those students would be included in this category.\n\nAlso, the problem doesn't mention any students who might have scored exactly 90, so we can assume that the 25% who scored above 90 and the remaining 75% who scored below or equal to 90 cover all the students.\n\nSo, my final answer is 30 students scored below or equal to 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
