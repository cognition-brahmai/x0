        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: In a group of 50 people, 30 prefer coffee, 20 prefer tea, and 10 like both coffee and tea. I need to find out how many people do not like either coffee or tea.\n\nOkay, so first, I should probably figure out how many people like either coffee or tea or both. Then, I can subtract that number from the total number of people to find out how many don't like either.\n\nI remember there's a principle in set theory called the inclusion-exclusion principle that might be useful here. It helps to avoid double-counting when dealing with overlapping sets.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\n- Let C be the set of people who like coffee.\n\n- Let T be the set of people who like tea.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- The total number of people is 50.\n\n- The number of people who like coffee, |C|, is 30.\n\n- The number of people who like tea, |T|, is 20.\n\n- The number of people who like both coffee and tea, |C \u2229 T|, is 10.\n\nWe need to find the number of people who like either coffee or tea or both, which is |C \u222a T|.\n\nAccording to the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|C \u222a T| = |C| + |T| - |C \u2229 T|\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n|C \u222a T| = 30 + 20 - 10 = 40\n\nSo, 40 people like either coffee or tea or both.\n\nNow, to find the number of people who do not like either coffee or tea, we subtract the number of people who like at least one of them from the total number of people:\n\nNumber of people who like neither = Total number of people - |C \u222a T| = 50 - 40 = 10\n\nTherefore, 10 people do not like either coffee or tea.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 30 like coffee and 20 like tea, but 10 like both, then the number of people who like only coffee is 30 - 10 = 20, and the number of people who like only tea is 20 - 10 = 10. So, total number of people who like either coffee or tea or both is 20 (only coffee) + 10 (only tea) + 10 (both) = 40, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnd then, 50 - 40 = 10 people who like neither. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it using a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents coffee lovers, and the other represents tea lovers. The overlapping part is those who like both.\n\nSo, the coffee circle has 30 people, but since 10 of those also like tea, the exclusive coffee lovers are 30 - 10 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, the tea circle has 20 people, but 10 of those also like coffee, so exclusive tea lovers are 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nThen, the overlapping section is 10 people who like both.\n\nSo, total people who like at least one of them is 20 (only coffee) + 10 (only tea) + 10 (both) = 40.\n\nAgain, 50 - 40 = 10 people who like neither.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother method could be to use the concept of sets and their complements.\n\nIf U is the universal set representing all 50 people, then the set of people who like coffee is C, and the set of people who like tea is T.\n\nThe set of people who like neither is the complement of the union of C and T, which is U - (C \u222a T).\n\nWe already found |C \u222a T| = 40, and |U| = 50, so |U - (C \u222a T)| = 50 - 40 = 10.\n\nThis matches our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, using probabilities, if this were a probability question, but since it's about counts, the set theory approach is more straightforward.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 10 people who do not like either coffee or tea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
