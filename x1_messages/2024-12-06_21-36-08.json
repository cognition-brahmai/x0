Panicked, Hana tries to recapture the Kraken but fails, leading to a city-wide manhunt.\n\nDetermined to fix her mistake, Hana turns to Jiji for help. He reveals that their family possesses an ancient technique called **\"Soul Fold,\"** which can infuse life into origami creations. However, this power comes with great responsibility, as the creatures can be influenced by the folder's emotions and intentions.\n\nJiji trains Hana in the art of Soul Fold, teaching her how to create and control origami beings. Along the way, they encounter other origami masters, each specializing in different aspects of the craft, such as **SENSEI YUKIO**, who focuses on peaceful, nature-inspired creations, and **MASTER KAITO**, a former student of Jiji who has fallen into darkness, using Soul Fold for personal gain.\n\nAs Hana masters her skills, she discovers that the Kraken was not the only creature awakened. A malevolent force, known as **THE SHADOW FOLD**, has been manipulating the origami creatures, turning them against humanity. This shadowy entity seeks to consume the souls of living beings to gain ultimate power.\n\nHana, Taku, Jiji, and their allies must embark on a perilous adventure across Japan, from the serene temples of Kyoto to the towering skyscrapers of Tokyo, to collect the scattered fragments of an ancient origami artifact that can seal away the Shadow Fold.\n\nAlong the way, they encounter various origami creatures, both benevolent and malevolent, each representing different aspects of Japanese folklore and culture. These include the **KAMI** (paper gods), **ONI** (demons), **TANUKI** (shape-shifting raccoon dogs), and **KITSUNE** (fox spirits).\n\nAs they journey, Hana learns about the deep cultural significance of origami in Japan, from its use in religious ceremonies to its role in storytelling and meditation. She also grapples with the ethical implications of creating life and the responsibilities that come with such power.\n\nIn a climactic battle, Hana faces off against Master Kaito, who has been corrupted by the Shadow Fold. With the help of her friends and the origami creatures she has befriended, she manages to defeat Kaito and seal away the Shadow Fold, saving the city from destruction.\n\nIn the aftermath, Hana chooses to continue her journey, traveling the world to spread the art of origami and promote peace and understanding between different cultures.
