        "content": "So I need to find the area of a rectangle, and I know that the length is 12 meters and the width is 7 meters. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, I'll do that.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n\nNow, I'll plug in the values I have:\n\nArea = 12 meters \u00d7 7 meters\n\nNow, I just need to multiply 12 by 7. Let's see, 12 times 7 is equal to 84.\n\nSo, the area is 84 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that I'm using the correct units. Since both the length and width are in meters, the area should be in square meters, which makes sense.\n\nLet me double-check my multiplication just to be sure. 12 times 7:\n\n10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. Adding those together, 70 + 14 equals 84. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is 84 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]"
