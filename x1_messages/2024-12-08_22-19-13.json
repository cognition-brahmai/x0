        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I've got a box with red, blue, and green balls, totaling 60 balls. The probabilities are a bit tricky here: the probability of picking a red ball is twice that of picking a blue ball, and the probability of picking a green ball is half that of picking a blue ball.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these probabilities are based on. Since probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of outcomes, I can express the number of each color ball in terms of variables.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of blue balls.\n\n- Then, since the probability of picking a red ball is twice that of picking a blue ball, the number of red balls \\( r \\) should be twice the number of blue balls, right? So, \\( r = 2b \\).\n\n- Similarly, the probability of picking a green ball is half that of picking a blue ball, so the number of green balls \\( g \\) should be half the number of blue balls, meaning \\( g = \\frac{1}{2}b \\).\n\nNow, the total number of balls is 60, so:\n\n\\[ r + b + g = 60 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ 2b + b + \\frac{1}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[ 3b + \\frac{1}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{6}{2}b + \\frac{1}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{60 \\times 2}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{120}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ b \\approx 17.14 \\]\n\nHmm, but the number of balls has to be a whole number. You can't have a fraction of a ball. This suggests that my initial approach might be flawed.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the probabilities in terms of ratios.\n\nLet \\( p_b \\) be the probability of picking a blue ball. Then:\n\n- \\( p_r = 2p_b \\) (probability of picking a red ball)\n\n- \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\) (probability of picking a green ball)\n\nSince these are probabilities, their sum should equal 1:\n\n\\[ p_r + p_b + p_g = 1 \\]\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\[ 2p_b + p_b + \\frac{1}{2}p_b = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 3p_b + \\frac{1}{2}p_b = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{2}p_b = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{2}{7} \\]\n\nNow, the number of blue balls \\( b \\) is the probability times the total number of balls:\n\n\\[ b = p_b \\times 60 = \\frac{2}{7} \\times 60 \\approx 17.14 \\]\n\nAgain, I get a fraction, which doesn't make sense for counting balls. Maybe I need to think about the ratios in terms of parts.\n\nLet's consider the ratios:\n\n- Red balls are twice as likely as blue balls, so for every blue ball, there are 2 red balls.\n\n- Green balls are half as likely as blue balls, so for every blue ball, there are 0.5 green balls.\n\nThis seems problematic because we can't have half a ball. Maybe I need to adjust the ratios to whole numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s think in terms of multiples. Suppose we have:\n\n- 2 parts red\n\n- 1 part blue\n\n- 0.5 parts green\n\nBut again, parts should be whole numbers. To eliminate the fraction, maybe I can multiply all parts by 2:\n\n- Red: 4 parts\n\n- Blue: 2 parts\n\n- Green: 1 part\n\nNow, the total parts are 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 parts.\n\nGiven that the total number of balls is 60, each part represents \\( \\frac{60}{7} \\approx 8.57 \\) balls, which is still not a whole number.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is still flawed because the total number of balls isn't divisible by the sum of the parts.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the total number of balls isn't divisible by 7, which is causing this issue. Let me check:\n\n\\[ 60 \\div 7 = 8.\\overline{57} \\]\n\nIndeed, it's not a whole number. Maybe the problem has no solution, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me go back to the probability definitions.\n\nProbability of picking a red ball \\( p_r = 2p_b \\)\n\nProbability of picking a green ball \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\)\n\nAnd \\( p_r + p_b + p_g = 1 \\)\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\[ 2p_b + p_b + \\frac{1}{2}p_b = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{2}p_b = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{2}{7} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ p_r = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{4}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{1}{7} \\]\n\nNow, the number of balls of each color should be:\n\n\\[ r = p_r \\times 60 = \\frac{4}{7} \\times 60 \\approx 34.2857 \\]\n\n\\[ b = p_b \\times 60 = \\frac{2}{7} \\times 60 \\approx 17.1429 \\]\n\n\\[ g = p_g \\times 60 = \\frac{1}{7} \\times 60 \\approx 8.5714 \\]\n\nAgain, fractions of balls don't make sense. This suggests that with 60 balls, it's impossible to satisfy the given probability conditions with whole numbers.\n\nPerhaps the total number of balls should be a multiple of 7 to make the parts whole numbers. Let's test this.\n\nSuppose the total number of balls is 7:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{4}{7} \\times 7 = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{2}{7} \\times 7 = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{1}{7} \\times 7 = 1 \\]\n\nThat works perfectly: 4 red, 2 blue, 1 green, totaling 7 balls.\n\nBut the problem states there are 60 balls. So, maybe the problem is misstated, or perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities are not directly proportional to the number of balls due to some weighting or other factors, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the probabilities are based on the ratios of the numbers of balls.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( r \\) = number of red balls\n\n- \\( b \\) = number of blue balls\n\n- \\( g \\) = number of green balls\n\nGiven:\n\n1. \\( r + b + g = 60 \\)\n\n2. \\( \\frac{r}{60} = 2 \\times \\frac{b}{60} \\) \u21d2 \\( r = 2b \\)\n\n3. \\( \\frac{g}{60} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{b}{60} \\) \u21d2 \\( g = \\frac{1}{2}b \\)\n\nNow, plugging into the first equation:\n\n\\[ 2b + b + \\frac{1}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 3b + \\frac{1}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{120}{7} \\approx 17.14 \\]\n\nSame as before.\n\nThis suggests that either the total number of balls needs to be adjusted or the probability relationships need to be reevaluated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are not directly translatable to the counts in that manner.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe the probabilities are related through some other means.\n\nSuppose the probability of picking a red ball is twice that of picking a blue ball, meaning \\( p_r = 2p_b \\), and the probability of picking a green ball is half that of picking a blue ball, so \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\).\n\nSince probabilities must sum to 1:\n\n\\[ p_r + p_b + p_g = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 2p_b + p_b + \\frac{1}{2}p_b = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{2}p_b = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{2}{7} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ p_r = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{4}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{1}{7} \\]\n\nNow, the expected number of each ball would be:\n\n\\[ r = p_r \\times 60 = \\frac{4}{7} \\times 60 \\approx 34.2857 \\]\n\n\\[ b = p_b \\times 60 = \\frac{2}{7} \\times 60 \\approx 17.1429 \\]\n\n\\[ g = p_g \\times 60 = \\frac{1}{7} \\times 60 \\approx 8.5714 \\]\n\nAgain, fractions of balls don't make sense. Perhaps the problem allows for rounding, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities are meant to be in whole numbers, and the total number of balls should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are based on the ratios of the numbers of balls, but scaled differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the number of red balls is twice the number of blue balls, and the number of green balls is half the number of blue balls.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ r = 2b \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{1}{2}b \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ r + b + g = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 2b + b + \\frac{1}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{120}{7} \\approx 17.14 \\]\n\nSame issue as before.\n\nPerhaps the problem is intended to have non-integer solutions, but that doesn't make sense in the context of counting balls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities are not directly proportional to the number of balls, but perhaps weighted in some other way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n\"The probability of picking a red ball is twice that of picking a blue ball, while the chance of picking a green ball is half that of picking a blue ball. If there are 60 balls in total, how many balls of each color are there?\"\n\nI think the issue is that the total number of balls is 60, which isn't divisible by 7, leading to fractional balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are intended to be in simplest form, and the numbers of balls are to be determined accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the ratios again:\n\n\\[ r : b : g = 2 : 1 : 0.5 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply all parts by 2:\n\n\\[ r : b : g = 4 : 2 : 1 \\]\n\nSo, for every 4 red balls, there are 2 blue balls and 1 green ball, totaling 7 balls.\n\nBut we have 60 balls, which is not a multiple of 7. So, perhaps the problem has no solution with whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find the closest possible whole numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nIf we have 4 red, 2 blue, and 1 green for every 7 balls, then in 60 balls, we would have:\n\nNumber of sets of 7 balls in 60: \\( \\frac{60}{7} \\approx 8.571 \\)\n\nThen:\n\nRed balls: \\( 4 \\times 8.571 \\approx 34.2857 \\)\n\nBlue balls: \\( 2 \\times 8.571 \\approx 17.1429 \\)\n\nGreen balls: \\( 1 \\times 8.571 \\approx 8.5714 \\)\n\nAgain, fractions of balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can have 8 sets of 7 balls, which is 56 balls, and then distribute the remaining 4 balls somehow.\n\nIn 8 sets:\n\nRed: \\( 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\)\n\nBlue: \\( 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\)\n\nGreen: \\( 1 \\times 8 = 8 \\)\n\nTotal: 56 balls\n\nNow, we have 4 balls left. How to distribute them while maintaining the required probabilities as closely as possible?\n\nIf we add these 4 balls to the red balls, we get:\n\nRed: 36, Blue: 16, Green: 8, Total: 60\n\nBut check the probabilities:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{36}{60} = 0.6 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{16}{60} \\approx 0.2667 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{8}{60} \\approx 0.1333 \\]\n\nNow, check if \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.2667 \\approx 0.5334 \\neq 0.6 \\]\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.2667 \\approx 0.13335 \\approx 0.1333 \\]\n\nSo, \\( p_g \\) is approximately correct, but \\( p_r \\) is not.\n\nAlternatively, add 3 red and 1 blue:\n\nRed: 35, Blue: 17, Green: 8, Total: 60\n\nCheck probabilities:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{35}{60} \\approx 0.5833 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{17}{60} \\approx 0.2833 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{8}{60} \\approx 0.1333 \\]\n\nCheck \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.2833 \\approx 0.5666 \\neq 0.5833 \\]\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.2833 \\approx 0.1417 \\neq 0.1333 \\]\n\nNot quite matching.\n\nAlternatively, add 2 red and 2 blue:\n\nRed: 34, Blue: 18, Green: 8, Total: 60\n\nCheck probabilities:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{34}{60} \\approx 0.5667 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{18}{60} = 0.3 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{8}{60} \\approx 0.1333 \\]\n\nCheck \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.3 = 0.6 \\neq 0.5667 \\]\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.3 = 0.15 \\neq 0.1333 \\]\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, add 1 red and 3 blue:\n\nRed: 33, Blue: 19, Green: 8, Total: 60\n\nCheck probabilities:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{33}{60} = 0.55 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{19}{60} \\approx 0.3167 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{8}{60} \\approx 0.1333 \\]\n\nCheck \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.3167 \\approx 0.6334 \\neq 0.55 \\]\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.3167 \\approx 0.1583 \\neq 0.1333 \\]\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, add 4 green balls:\n\nRed: 32, Blue: 16, Green: 12, Total: 60\n\nCheck probabilities:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{32}{60} \\approx 0.5333 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{16}{60} \\approx 0.2667 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{12}{60} = 0.2 \\]\n\nCheck \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.2667 \\approx 0.5334 \\approx 0.5333 \\]\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.2667 \\approx 0.13335 \\neq 0.2 \\]\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, add 2 red and 2 green:\n\nRed: 34, Blue: 16, Green: 10, Total: 60\n\nCheck probabilities:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{34}{60} \\approx 0.5667 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{16}{60} \\approx 0.2667 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{10}{60} \\approx 0.1667 \\]\n\nCheck \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.2667 \\approx 0.5334 \\neq 0.5667 \\]\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.2667 \\approx 0.13335 \\neq 0.1667 \\]\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, try 36 red, 18 blue, 6 green:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{36}{60} = 0.6 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{18}{60} = 0.3 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{6}{60} = 0.1 \\]\n\nCheck \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.3 = 0.6 \\]\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.3 = 0.15 \\neq 0.1 \\]\n\nDoesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, 34 red, 17 blue, 9 green:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{34}{60} \\approx 0.5667 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{17}{60} \\approx 0.2833 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{9}{60} = 0.15 \\]\n\nCheck \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.2833 \\approx 0.5666 \\approx 0.5667 \\]\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.2833 \\approx 0.1417 \\neq 0.15 \\]\n\nClose but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, 35 red, 17 blue, 8 green:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{35}{60} \\approx 0.5833 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{17}{60} \\approx 0.2833 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{8}{60} \\approx 0.1333 \\]\n\nCheck \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.2833 \\approx 0.5666 \\neq 0.5833 \\]\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.2833 \\approx 0.1417 \\neq 0.1333 \\]\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, 32 red, 16 blue, 12 green:\n\n\\[ p_r = \\frac{32}{60} \\approx 0.5333 \\]\n\n\\[ p_b = \\frac{16}{60} \\approx 0.2667 \\]\n\n\\[ p_g = \\frac{12}{60} = 0.2 \\]\n\nCheck \\( p_r = 2p_b \\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.2667 \\approx 0.5334 \\approx 0.5333 \\]\n\nAnd \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.2667 \\approx 0.13335 \\neq 0.2 \\]\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, 40 red, 20 blue, 0 green:\n\nBut that's not possible since there are green balls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for zero green balls, but the problem says \"red, blue, and green balls,\" implying there are some of each.\n\nThis is getting frustrating.

15%)\n\nSo, depending on which condition is more important, different solutions might be preferred.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to accept some approximation due to the constraints of having a total of 60 balls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to demonstrate that such conditions cannot be met with whole numbers and 60 balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach entirely.\n\nLet me consider that the probabilities are based on the number of balls, but perhaps there's a different relationship.\n\nSuppose that the number of red balls is twice the number of blue balls, and the number of green balls is half the number of blue balls.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ r = 2b \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{1}{2}b \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ r + b + g = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 2b + b + \\frac{1}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{120}{7} \\approx 17.14 \\]\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are not directly proportional to the number of balls, but are instead defined differently.\n\nWait a second, maybe the probabilities are defined based on some other factors, like the balls are not equally likely to be picked.\n\nBut the problem says \"the probability of picking a red ball is twice that of picking a blue ball,\" which typically implies that the number of red balls is twice the number of blue balls, assuming each ball is equally likely to be picked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the picking is not equally likely, which would complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted in terms of expected values or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of green balls is half the number of blue balls, but in terms of probability, not in terms of count.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the chance of picking a green ball is half that of picking a blue ball.\"\n\nDoes \"chance of picking\" refer to probability or to the number of balls?\n\nI think it refers to probability.\n\nSo, \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( p_r = 2p_b \\)\n\nAnd \\( p_r + p_b + p_g = 1 \\)\n\nWhich leads to the same equations as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"chance of picking\" refers to the number of balls, not the probability.\n\nIn that case, \\( g = \\frac{1}{2}b \\)\n\nAnd \\( r = 2b \\)\n\nWhich again leads to the same equations.\n\nI'm stuck in a loop here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the number of green balls is half the number of blue balls, but since we can't have half a ball, perhaps some balls are multi-colored or something, but that seems far-fetched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misphrased, and it should specify that the number of red balls is twice the number of blue balls, and the number of green balls is half the number of blue balls, in which case, with 60 balls, it's impossible to have whole numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are intended to be in the ratio 4:2:1 for red:blue:green, and the numbers are to be determined accordingly, accepting that they won't be exact multiples due to the total being 60.\n\nIn that case, the closest whole number solution would be 34 red, 17 blue, and 9 green balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to solve for the number of blue balls being a multiple of 2 to make the green balls a whole number.\n\nIf \\( b = 18 \\), then \\( g = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 = 9 \\), and \\( r = 2 \\times 18 = 36 \\)\n\nTotal: 36 + 18 + 9 = 63, which is more than 60.\n\nNot suitable.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( b = 16 \\), then \\( g = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 = 8 \\), and \\( r = 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\)\n\nTotal: 32 + 16 + 8 = 56, which is less than 60.\n\nNot suitable.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( b = 17 \\), \\( g = \\frac{17}{2} = 8.5 \\), which is not a whole number.\n\nNo good.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of blue balls is 14, then \\( g = 7 \\), \\( r = 28 \\), total = 28 + 14 + 7 = 49, which is less than 60.\n\nNot suitable.\n\nAlternatively, \\( b = 18 \\), \\( g = 9 \\), \\( r = 36 \\), total = 36 + 18 + 9 = 63, which is more than 60.\n\nNot suitable.\n\nAlternatively, \\( b = 15 \\), \\( g = 7.5 \\), which is not a whole number.\n\nNo good.\n\nAlternatively, \\( b = 12 \\), \\( g = 6 \\), \\( r = 24 \\), total = 24 + 12 + 6 = 42, which is less than 60.\n\nNot suitable.\n\nIt seems that no whole number of blue balls will satisfy the conditions with a total of 60 balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with fractions, treating the numbers of balls as continuous variables, but that doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and the total number of balls is meant to be a multiple of 7.\n\nFor example, if there were 70 balls, then:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{120}{7} \\times \\frac{70}{60} = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ r = 40 \\]\n\n\\[ g = 10 \\]\n\nTotal: 40 + 20 + 10 = 70\n\nBut the problem specifies 60 balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and it should be 63 balls, which is divisible by 7.\n\nIn that case:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{120}{7} \\times \\frac{63}{60} = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ r = 36 \\]\n\n\\[ g = 9 \\]\n\nTotal: 36 + 18 + 9 = 63\n\nBut again, the problem specifies 60 balls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that it's impossible to have whole numbers with 60 balls, and thus, no solution exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that some balls are not picked, or some other creative solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are based on some other factors, like weighted probabilities, but that seems beyond the scope of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"chance of picking a green ball is half that of picking a blue ball\" refers to the number of green balls being half the number of blue balls, not the probability.\n\nIn that case:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{1}{2}b \\]\n\nAnd \\( r = 2b \\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ r + b + g = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ 2b + b + \\frac{1}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{2}b = 60 \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{120}{7} \\approx 17.14 \\]\n\nSame issue as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the chance of picking a green ball is half that of picking a blue ball\" means that the probability of picking a green ball is half the probability of picking a blue ball, which is consistent with \\( p_g = \\frac{1}{2}p_b \\), leading back to the same equations.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most reasonable approach is to accept that with 60 balls, it's impossible to satisfy the given probability conditions with whole numbers, and thus, no solution exists.\n\nHowever, if we are to choose the closest possible whole numbers, 34 red, 17 blue, and 9 green balls would be a reasonable approximation, as it comes closest to satisfying the probability conditions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows for fractional balls, then the exact solution would be:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{120}{7} \\approx 17.1429 \\]\n\n\\[ r = 2 \\times 17.1429 \\approx 34.2857 \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 17.1429 \\approx 8.5714 \\]\n\nBut again, fractional balls don't make sense in reality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that some balls are multi-colored, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of balls is meant to be adjusted to the nearest multiple of 7, which would be 63, and then have 36 red, 18 blue, and 9 green balls.\n\nBut again, the problem specifies 60 balls.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best approach is to conclude that no whole number solution exists for 60 balls under the given probability conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No whole number solution exists for 60 balls under the given probability conditions.}} \\]"
