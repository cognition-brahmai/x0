        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a small town where everyone knows each other, and any two people are either friends or enemies. When two friends meet, they shake hands, but enemies don't shake hands at all. At a party in this town, there were 28 handshakes, and we need to figure out how many people attended the party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships between the people at the party. Since every pair of people is either friends or enemies, and only friends shake hands, the total number of handshakes should correspond to the number of friend pairs present at the party.\n\nLet's denote the number of people at the party as n. The total number of possible pairs of people at the party is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2. This represents all possible ways two people can meet.\n\nHowever, not all of these pairs will shake hands because some are enemies. Only the friend pairs will shake hands. So, if we let f be the number of friend pairs, then the number of handshakes is equal to f, which is given as 28.\n\nNow, I need to relate f to n. Since every pair is either a friend pair or an enemy pair, and enemies don't shake hands, the number of friend pairs is simply the total number of pairs minus the number of enemy pairs. But actually, since enemies don't shake hands, the number of handshakes is just the number of friend pairs.\n\nSo, f = C(n, 2) - e, where e is the number of enemy pairs. But since enemies don't shake hands, and handshakes are only between friends, f is directly equal to the number of handshakes, which is 28.\n\nWait a minute, but in this setup, it's only friends who shake hands, so f = number of handshakes = 28.\n\nBut C(n, 2) = f + e, where e is the number of enemy pairs.\n\nHowever, since we don't have information about the number of enemy pairs, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me think differently. In a group of n people, where every pair is either a friend or an enemy, and only friends shake hands, the number of handshakes is equal to the number of friend pairs, which is 28.\n\nSo, f = 28.\n\nBut f is also equal to C(n, 2) minus the number of enemy pairs, but without knowing e, that doesn't help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that in this town, the relationship between any two people is either friend or enemy, and it's a complete graph where edges are either present (friends) or absent (enemies).\n\nIn graph theory terms, the number of handshakes is the number of edges in the graph, which is 28.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding n such that C(n, 2) = 28.\n\nWait, but that would assume that everyone is friends with everyone else, which isn't the case here, since there are enemies who don't shake hands.\n\nSo, C(n, 2) is the maximum possible number of handshakes if everyone were friends, but in this case, some pairs are enemies and don't shake hands, so the actual number of handshakes is less than or equal to C(n, 2).\n\nGiven that, we have f = 28, and f \u2264 C(n, 2).\n\nBut without knowing how many enemy pairs there are, it seems like we don't have enough information to determine n uniquely.\n\nWait, but the problem states that \"every person knows everyone else,\" meaning that every pair is either friends or enemies, with no neutral status.\n\nAnd the only handshakes occur between friends.\n\nSo, the number of handshakes is equal to the number of friend pairs, which is f = 28.\n\nBut f can be any number less than or equal to C(n, 2), depending on how many enemy pairs there are.\n\nThis suggests that for different numbers of enemy pairs, the same number of handshakes can be achieved with different numbers of people.\n\nFor example, with n = 8, C(8, 2) = 28, so if there are no enemy pairs, f = 28.\n\nBut if n = 9, C(9, 2) = 36, and if there are 8 enemy pairs, then f = 36 - 8 = 28.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 10, C(10, 2) = 45, and if there are 17 enemy pairs, f = 45 - 17 = 28.\n\nThis means there are multiple possible values of n that could satisfy f = 28, depending on the number of enemy pairs.\n\nSo, is there something else in the problem that I'm missing that could help determine a unique n?\n\nLet's re-read the problem: \"In a small town, every person knows everyone else. If you randomly select two people from the town, they will either be friends or enemies. If two friends meet, they shake hands. If two enemies meet, they do not shake hands. At a party in the town, there were 28 handshakes. How many people attended the party?\"\n\nHmm, it seems straightforward, but it leads to multiple possible solutions as per my earlier reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the town has a specific structure of friendships and enmities that can help determine n.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide any additional constraints or properties about the friendships or enmities beyond the fact that every pair is either friends or enemies.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the town is such that the friendship relationships form a specific type of graph, like a complete graph or something else with particular properties.\n\nBut again, without additional information, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in such a setup, there's a specific formula relating the number of handshakes to the number of people.\n\nWait, perhaps I can set up an equation based on the number of handshakes.\n\nWe have f = 28, and f = C(n, 2) - e, where e is the number of enemy pairs.\n\nBut without knowing e, that doesn't help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the number of handshakes is equal to half the sum of the degrees of the vertices in the graph, where each vertex represents a person and an edge represents a friendship.\n\nIn graph theory, the sum of the degrees is equal to twice the number of edges, so sum of degrees = 2*f = 56.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible values of n such that C(n, 2) \u2265 28, and see which one makes sense.\n\nLet's calculate C(n, 2) for some small values of n:\n\nC(8, 2) = 28\n\nC(9, 2) = 36\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nC(7, 2) = 21, which is less than 28, so n cannot be 7 because there couldn't be 28 handshakes.\n\nFor n = 8, C(8, 2) = 28, so if there are no enemy pairs, f = 28.\n\nFor n = 9, C(9, 2) = 36, so f = 36 - e, and to have f = 28, e = 8.\n\nFor n = 10, C(10, 2) = 45, so f = 45 - e, and to have f = 28, e = 17.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, theoretically, for any n \u2265 8, there exists a number of enemy pairs e such that f = 28.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple possible values of n that satisfy the condition of having 28 handshakes.\n\nBut the problem seems to expect a single answer.\n\nPerhaps there's an assumption that the relationships are such that the number of enemy pairs is minimized, or some other constraint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the town has a specific property that I haven't considered yet.\n\nWait, the problem says \"in a small town, every person knows everyone else.\" Maybe the size \"small\" is meant to imply a specific number, but that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the town has a specific friendship structure, like everyone has the same number of friends, but again, the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem is implying that the friendship graph is complemented by the enemy relationships, and we need to consider properties of complementary graphs.\n\nBut again, without more information, that seems like a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the number of handshakes is 28, and find the smallest n such that C(n, 2) \u2265 28, which is n = 8.\n\nBut as we've seen, n = 8 only works if there are no enemy pairs, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the friendships form a specific type of graph, like a clique or something similar.\n\nBut again, that's not specified in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in this town, the relationships are such that there are no three people who are all mutual friends or all mutual enemies, or some other condition, but that would be speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation in the problem setup.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement: \"In a small town, every person knows everyone else. If you randomly select two people from the town, they will either be friends or enemies. If two friends meet, they shake hands. If two enemies meet, they do not shake hands. At a party in the town, there were 28 handshakes. How many people attended the party?\"\n\nIt seems clear: n people attend the party, each pair is either friends or enemies, friends shake hands, enemies do not, total handshakes are 28, find n.\n\nGiven that, and without additional constraints, it appears that there are multiple possible values of n that satisfy the condition, as shown earlier.\n\nBut perhaps there's a standard assumption in such problems that the friendship graph is complete, meaning everyone is friends with everyone else, but that would make e = 0, and f = C(n, 2) = 28, leading to n = 8.\n\nHowever, the problem states that enemies exist, as they do not shake hands, so assuming e = 0 might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the number of enemies is minimized, which would again lead to e = 0 and n = 8.\n\nBut again, that contradicts the presence of enemies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that the number of enemies is maximized, but that also doesn't lead to a unique solution.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that in such a town, the relationships are such that the number of friends each person has is the same, making it a regular graph.\n\nIf that's the case, then each person has the same number of friends, say k, then the total number of handshakes would be C(n, 2) - C(n - k, 2), but that seems complicated and not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, in a regular graph, the number of edges (handshakes) is (n*k)/2, since each of the n vertices has k edges.\n\nGiven that, we have (n*k)/2 = 28, so n*k = 56.\n\nNow, we need to find integer values of n and k such that n*k = 56, and k < n (since you can't be friends with yourself).\n\nPossible pairs (n, k):\n\n(7, 8) but C(7, 2) = 21 < 28, which doesn't work.\n\n(8, 7): C(8, 2) = 28, which would require e = 0, meaning no enemies, but the problem mentions enemies.\n\n(14, 4): C(14, 2) = 91, e = 91 - 28 = 63 enemy pairs.\n\n(28, 2): C(28, 2) = 378, e = 378 - 28 = 350 enemy pairs.\n\n(56, 1): C(56, 2) = 1540, e = 1540 - 28 = 1512 enemy pairs.\n\nBut the problem says it's a small town, so n = 8 seems more plausible than n = 14 or higher.\n\nHowever, n = 8 only works if e = 0, meaning no enemies, which contradicts the problem statement that there are enemies.\n\nWait, the problem says \"they will either be friends or enemies,\" so enemies may exist, but it doesn't specify that there must be enemies.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the case where e = 0 is allowed, meaning all pairs are friends, and thus f = C(n, 2) = 28, leading to n = 8.\n\nBut it seems that the problem mentions enemies to suggest that e > 0.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the number of enemies is minimized, which would be e = 0, leading to n = 8.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the mention of enemies seems superfluous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about it in terms of graph theory, where the graph is undirected, with nodes representing people, and edges representing friendships.\n\nThen, the number of handshakes is equal to the number of edges in the graph, which is 28.\n\nSo, we have a graph with n nodes and 28 edges.\n\nThe problem is to find n.\n\nBut without additional constraints on the graph, such as connectivity or degree constraints, there are multiple n that satisfy C(n, 2) \u2265 28.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is incomplete or missing some information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard assumption in such problems that the graph is complete, but that would make e = 0, which may not align with the problem's mention of enemies.\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be solved using the handshaking lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, sum of degrees = 2*28 = 56.\n\nBut without knowing something about the degrees of the vertices, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in this town, the friendship relationships satisfy some specific property, like being a friendship graph or something, but that seems too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be solved by considering that the number of handshakes is maximized given the presence of enemies, but again, without more information, that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the problem statement.\n\nLet me try rephrasing the problem:\n\nIn a small town, every person knows everyone else, and any two people are either friends or enemies. At a party in the town, there were 28 handshakes, with handshakes occurring only between friends. How many people attended the party?\n\nGiven that, and considering that enemies don't shake hands, it seems that the number of handshakes is equal to the number of friend pairs, which is f = 28.\n\nGiven that, and without additional constraints, there are multiple possible values of n that satisfy f = 28, as shown earlier.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem expects the minimal possible n, which would be n = 8, with e = 0.\n\nBut that would mean there are no enemies, which contradicts the problem's mention of enemies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a specific n where C(n, 2) = 28, which is n = 8.\n\nBut again, that would imply e = 0, no enemies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is misphrased or incomplete, and additional information is needed to determine a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach or formula that applies here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the number of handshakes is equal to the number of friend pairs, which is f = 28, and that in such a setup, there's a specific relationship between n and f.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the number of handshakes is equal to C(n, 2) minus the number of enemy pairs, which is f = C(n, 2) - e = 28.\n\nBut without knowing e, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up an equation based on the possible values of n and e.\n\nFor example, C(n, 2) - e = 28.\n\nBut again, without knowing e, it's not solvable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to bound e based on the problem's conditions.\n\nBut I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that in such a town, the friendship relationships satisfy some specific property that can be exploited to find n.\n\nBut without additional information, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the number of handshakes is 28, and finding n such that C(n, 2) = 28, which is n = 8.\n\nBut as we've seen, that would require e = 0, meaning no enemies, which contradicts the problem's mention of enemies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the number of enemies is minimized, which again leads to e = 0 and n = 8.\n\nBut that seems like a weak assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have multiple possible solutions, and the answer is a set of possible n values.\n\nBut that doesn't seem likely, as the problem asks for \"how many people attended the party,\" suggesting a single answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard result or formula that applies to this situation, which I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in such a setup, the number of handshakes must satisfy certain conditions based on n and e, but again, without more information, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the number of handshakes is 28, and finding n such that C(n, 2) = 28, which is n = 8.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the mention of enemies is just to provide context, and the actual determination of n is based on the number of handshakes alone, implying n = 8.\n\nBut again, that ignores the possibility of enemies, which would reduce the number of handshakes below C(n, 2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the number of enemies is negligible or zero, which would again lead to n = 8.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that in a small town, the number of enemies is small compared to the number of friends, but without quantifying that, it's not useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the number of handshakes is 28, and finding the smallest n such that C(n, 2) \u2265 28, which is n = 8.\n\nGiven that, perhaps n = 8 is the answer, with the understanding that e = 0.\n\nBut again, that contradicts the problem's mention of enemies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that in such a town, the number of enemies is minimized, leading again to e = 0 and n = 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten or incomplete, and additional constraints are needed to determine a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem that I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the town has a specific structure of friendships and enmities that allows for a unique determination of n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the number of handshakes is 28, and assuming that the friendship graph is complete, meaning e = 0, leading to n = 8.\n\nGiven that, perhaps n = 8 is the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to make students realize that multiple solutions are possible, but given that it's a small town, n = 8 seems most plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects students to consider that in a small town, the number of enemies is small, and thus n is close to the minimal possible value, which is n = 8.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the answer is n = 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
