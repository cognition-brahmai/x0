        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I need to solve the heat equation \\( u_t = k \\, u_{xx} \\) for an insulated rod of length \\( L \\), with an initial temperature distribution \\( f(x) \\), and the constant \\( k > 0 \\). Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, the heat equation describes how heat propagates through a medium over time. In this case, it's a one-dimensional rod, so we're only considering heat flow in one direction, along the length of the rod. The equation \\( u_t = k \\, u_{xx} \\) tells us that the rate of change of temperature with respect to time (\\( u_t \\)) is proportional to the second spatial derivative of temperature (\\( u_{xx} \\)), with proportionality constant \\( k \\), which is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nNow, since the rod is insulated, that probably means there's no heat flowing through the ends, which typically translates to Neumann boundary conditions, where the derivative of temperature with respect to \\( x \\) at the ends is zero. So, I think the boundary conditions are:\n\n\\[\nu_x(0, t) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u_x(L, t) = 0\n\\]\n\nAnd the initial condition is:\n\n\\[\nu(x, 0) = f(x)\n\\]\n\nAlright, to solve this partial differential equation (PDE), I recall that separation of variables is a common method for linear PDEs like this one. So, let's assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on \\( x \\) and the other only on \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\\]\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation:\n\n\\[\nX(x)T'(t) = k \\, X''(x)T(t)\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\( k \\, X(x)T(t) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T'(t)}{k \\, T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\n\\]\n\nSince the left side depends only on \\( t \\) and the right side depends only on \\( x \\), they must both be equal to a constant, say \\( -\\lambda \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T'(t)}{k \\, T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1. \\( X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0 \\)\n\n2. \\( T'(t) + k \\lambda T(t) = 0 \\)\n\nFirst, let's solve the spatial ODE with the boundary conditions.\n\nGiven the insulation, we have:\n\n\\[\nX'(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad X'(L) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the general solution to \\( X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0 \\) depends on the value of \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n**Case 1: \\( \\lambda > 0 \\)**\n\nLet \\( \\lambda = \\beta^2 \\), then the general solution is:\n\n\\[\nX(x) = A \\cos(\\beta x) + B \\sin(\\beta x)\n\\]\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n\\[\nX'(x) = -A \\beta \\sin(\\beta x) + B \\beta \\cos(\\beta x)\n\\]\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nX'(0) = B \\beta = 0 \\implies B = 0\n\\]\n\nAt \\( x = L \\):\n\n\\[\nX'(L) = -A \\beta \\sin(\\beta L) = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\( A \\) cannot be zero (trivial solution), and \\( \\beta \\neq 0 \\), we must have:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(\\beta L) = 0 \\implies \\beta L = n \\pi \\implies \\beta = \\frac{n \\pi}{L}, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda_n = \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 \\), and the corresponding eigenfunctions are:\n\n\\[\nX_n(x) = \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Case 2: \\( \\lambda = 0 \\)**\n\nThe ODE becomes \\( X''(x) = 0 \\), with general solution:\n\n\\[\nX(x) = A x + B\n\\]\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n\\[\nX'(x) = A\n\\]\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nX'(0) = A = 0\n\\]\n\nAt \\( x = L \\):\n\n\\[\nX'(L) = A = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( X(x) = B \\), a constant. This is also an acceptable solution.\n\n**Case 3: \\( \\lambda < 0 \\)**\n\nLet \\( \\lambda = -\\alpha^2 \\), then the general solution is:\n\n\\[\nX(x) = A \\cosh(\\alpha x) + B \\sinh(\\alpha x)\n\\]\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n\\[\nX'(x) = A \\alpha \\sinh(\\alpha x) + B \\alpha \\cosh(\\alpha x)\n\\]\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nX'(0) = B \\alpha = 0 \\implies B = 0\n\\]\n\nAt \\( x = L \\):\n\n\\[\nX'(L) = A \\alpha \\sinh(\\alpha L) = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\( A \\) cannot be zero and \\( \\alpha \\neq 0 \\), we have \\( \\sinh(\\alpha L) = 0 \\). But \\( \\sinh \\) is only zero at zero, so no non-trivial solutions in this case.\n\nTherefore, the only possible eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda_n = \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 \\) for \\( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\), with corresponding eigenfunctions \\( X_n(x) = \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) \\).\n\nNow, solving the temporal ODE for each \\( \\lambda_n \\):\n\n\\[\nT'(t) + k \\lambda_n T(t) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, with solution:\n\n\\[\nT_n(t) = C_n e^{-k \\lambda_n t} = C_n e^{-k \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 t}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a sum of these solutions:\n\n\\[\nu(x, t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n e^{-k \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 t} \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right)\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficients \\( C_n \\), we use the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) = f(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThis is a Fourier cosine series, since the boundary conditions are Neumann (insulated ends). To find \\( C_n \\), we use the orthogonality of cosine functions:\n\n\\[\nC_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} f(x) \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) \\, dx, \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nNote that for \\( n = 0 \\), the formula is slightly different:\n\n\\[\nC_0 = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} f(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nSo, putting it all together, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\n\\[\nu(x, t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} f(x') \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x'}{L} \\right) \\, dx' \\right] e^{-k \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 t} \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWith \\( C_0 \\) defined separately as above.\n\nThis should be the final solution. Let me just double-check if I've missed anything.\n\n- I considered the insulation correctly, leading to Neumann boundary conditions.\n\n- I solved the spatial ODE for different cases of \\( \\lambda \\), and only positive \\( \\lambda \\) and zero gave non-trivial solutions.\n\n- I solved the temporal ODE for each \\( \\lambda_n \\).\n\n- I formed the general solution as a sum of the product of spatial and temporal solutions.\n\n- I applied the initial condition to find the Fourier coefficients \\( C_n \\).\n\n- I ensured that the formula for \\( C_0 \\) is correct, as it often differs from the other coefficients in Fourier series.\n\nI think that covers it. Solving the heat equation with Neumann boundary conditions leads to a Fourier cosine series solution, which makes sense for an insulated rod.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ u(x, t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} f(x') \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x'}{L} \\right) \\, dx' \\right] e^{-k \\left( \\frac{n \\pi}{L} \\right)^2 t} \\cos\\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{L} \\right) } \\]\n\nWith \\( C_0 = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} f(x) \\, dx \\)."
