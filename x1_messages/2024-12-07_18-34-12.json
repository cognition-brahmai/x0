        "content": "So I've got this problem: \"How many 3-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 without repeating any digit?\" Okay, let's see. I need to form 3-digit numbers using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, and I can't repeat any digit in the number. So, for example, 123 is okay, but 121 is not because it repeats the digit 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have four digits to choose from: 1, 2, 3, and 4. I need to select three distinct digits and arrange them in some order to form a 3-digit number. The order matters because, for example, 123 is different from 321.\n\nSo, this sounds like a permutation problem because the order in which we arrange the digits matters. In permutations, we consider the arrangement of items where the sequence is important.\n\nThe formula for permutations when selecting r items from a set of n distinct items is:\n\n\\[ P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\n- \\( n - r \\) accounts for the items not chosen.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 4 \\) because there are four digits to choose from, and \\( r = 3 \\) because we're forming 3-digit numbers.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ P(4, 3) = \\frac{4!}{(4 - 3)!} = \\frac{4!}{1!} \\]\n\nNow, calculating the factorials:\n\n\\[ 4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24 \\]\n\n\\[ 1! = 1 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(4, 3) = \\frac{24}{1} = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 24 different 3-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 without repeating any digit.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should try to list them out to verify.\n\nStarting with 1 as the first digit:\n\n- 123\n\n- 124\n\n- 132\n\n- 134\n\n- 142\n\n- 143\n\nThat's 6 numbers.\n\nNow, with 2 as the first digit:\n\n- 213\n\n- 214\n\n- 231\n\n- 234\n\n- 241\n\n- 243\n\nAnother 6 numbers.\n\nWith 3 as the first digit:\n\n- 312\n\n- 314\n\n- 321\n\n- 324\n\n- 341\n\n- 342\n\nAgain, 6 numbers.\n\nFinally, with 4 as the first digit:\n\n- 412\n\n- 413\n\n- 421\n\n- 423\n\n- 431\n\n- 432\n\nOnce more, 6 numbers.\n\nSo, in total, that's 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 numbers. That matches the result I got from the permutation formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it step by step. For the first digit, I have 4 choices (1, 2, 3, or 4). Once I've chosen the first digit, I can't repeat it, so for the second digit, I have 3 remaining choices. Then, for the third digit, I have 2 choices left.\n\nSo, the total number of possible 3-digit numbers is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24 \\]\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think this makes sense. It's important to remember that in permutations, the order matters, which is exactly what we need here since the sequence of digits determines the number.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there's any restriction on the digits being used. The problem says \"using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 without repeating any digit.\" It doesn't specify anything about leading zeros, but since none of the digits are zero, that's not an issue here.\n\nAlso, it's assuming that all these combinations are valid 3-digit numbers, which they are, since all digits are non-zero.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
