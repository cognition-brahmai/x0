        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. There's a man with 53 socks in his drawer: 21 blue, 15 black, and 17 red. The room is dark, so he can't see the colors. He needs to take out some socks to make sure he has at least one matching pair. The question is, how many socks must he take out to ensure that?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what it means to have at least one matching pair. That means among the socks he takes out, there should be at least two of the same color.\n\nNow, he has three colors: blue, black, and red. The worst-case scenario would be that he picks socks of different colors until it's impossible to pick another sock without getting a matching pair.\n\nLet's think about that worst-case scenario. If he picks one blue, one black, and one red sock, he has three socks, all of different colors. Now, if he picks a fourth sock, no matter what color it is, it will match one of the socks he already has.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the fourth sock is blue, it matches the blue sock he already picked.\n\n- If it's black, it matches the black one.\n\n- If it's red, it matches the red one.\n\nSo, in this case, by picking four socks, he ensures that at least two of them are of the same color.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there isn't a possibility where he can pick more than three socks without getting a matching pair. If he picks only three socks, each of a different color, then he doesn't have a matching pair. But as soon as he picks a fourth sock, it has to match one of the three colors he already has.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of socks he must take out to ensure at least one matching pair is four.\n\nHmm, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's a scenario where he can pick more than four socks without getting a matching pair. But no, because after three socks of different colors, any fourth sock will necessarily match one of them.\n\nAlternatively, think about it in terms of the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have n categories (in this case, three colors) and you have more than n items, then at least one category must contain more than one item.\n\nSo, with three colors, if he picks four socks, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must have at least two socks.\n\nTherefore, four is the answer.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"ensure that he has at least one matching pair.\" Is there any way he could have a matching pair by picking fewer than four socks? Well, if he picks two socks, they could be of different colors. For example, one blue and one black. So, no guarantee of a matching pair.\n\nIf he picks three socks, they could all be different colors, as I mentioned earlier. So, again, no guarantee.\n\nOnly when he picks four socks is there a guarantee that at least two are of the same color.\n\nSo, yes, four is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the total number of socks and the distribution of colors. He has 21 blue, 15 black, and 17 red socks, totaling 53 socks.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is that he picks one blue, one black, and one red sock first. That's three socks, all different colors. The fourth sock he picks must be one of these three colors, hence guaranteeing a matching pair.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many socks there are of each color beyond that; the worst-case scenario is still three socks of different colors, and the fourth sock forces a match.\n\nSo, the answer is four socks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
