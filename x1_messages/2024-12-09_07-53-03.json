        "content": "So if a factory makes 500 cars each month, and there are 12 months in a year, I guess I just need to multiply 500 by 12 to find out how many cars are made in a year. Let me try that.\n\n500 cars/month times 12 months/year would be 500 * 12 = 6,000 cars/year.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If they make 500 cars each month, after 12 months, it should be 500 multiplied by 12.\n\nLet me do the multiplication again: 500 times 12.\n\n500 times 10 is 5,000, and 500 times 2 is 1,000, so altogether that's 5,000 plus 1,000, which is 6,000.\n\nYeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of it as 500 cars each month for 12 months.\n\nSo, 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500.\n\nThat's adding 500 twelve times, which should also give me 6,000.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe I can divide the annual production by the monthly production to see if it equals 12.\n\nSo, if annual production is 6,000 cars, and monthly production is 500 cars, then 6,000 divided by 500 should be 12.\n\nLet's check: 6,000 \u00f7 500.\n\n500 times 12 is 6,000, so yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there are 12 months in a year, and each month they produce 500 cars, then the total yearly production is 500 * 12 = 6,000.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, what if the factory doesn't operate every month? What if there are months when they don't produce any cars due to maintenance or something?\n\nBut the question says \"if a factory produces 500 cars every month,\" so I think it's safe to assume that they produce 500 cars each and every month without fail.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, I should probably stick with the given information.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the factory produces 6,000 cars in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
