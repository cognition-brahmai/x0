        "content": "The world's largest coral reef system is located in Australia and is known as the Great Barrier Reef. It is indeed considered one of the seven natural wonders of the world due to its immense size and biodiversity. The Great Barrier Reef stretches over 2,300 kilometers (about 1,400 miles) and covers an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometers (about 133,000 square miles). It is home to thousands of species of marine life, including fish, mollusks, sharks, rays, and anemones, as well as countless species of corals. The reef also supports a significant tourism industry and is of great scientific and environmental importance. However, it faces threats from climate change, pollution, and other human activities, which pose significant challenges to its preservation."
