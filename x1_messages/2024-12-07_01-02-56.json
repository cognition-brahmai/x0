        "content": "Let's see. If a car gets 25 miles per gallon and has a 15-gallon fuel tank, to find out how far it can travel on a full tank, I think I just need to multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank.\n\nSo, that would be 25 miles/gallon times 15 gallons. The gallons unit should cancel out, leaving me with miles.\n\nLet me do the math: 25 times 15.\n\n25 times 10 is 250, and 25 times 5 is 125. Adding those together, 250 plus 125 equals 375.\n\nSo, the car can travel 375 miles on a full tank.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the car gets 25 miles per gallon, that means for every gallon of gas, it can go 25 miles. If it has 15 gallons, then indeed, 25 miles/gallon multiplied by 15 gallons gives 375 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the car can go 25 miles for each of the 15 gallons, so 25 miles times 15 equals 375 miles.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that could affect this calculation. For example, is the fuel tank's capacity exactly 15 gallons, or is that just the usable capacity, with some space left for expansion?\n\nIn real-world scenarios, fuel tanks are often designed with some extra space so that the fuel can expand without causing overflow. However, for the purpose of this calculation, I think it's safe to assume that the car can hold 15 gallons of fuel, and that's what we'll use.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the fuel efficiency rating of 25 miles per gallon is likely an average, and actual mileage can vary based on driving conditions, speed, traffic, and how the car is driven. But again, since we're given that figure, we'll use it as is.\n\nSo, in ideal conditions, with a car that gets 25 miles per gallon and a 15-gallon fuel tank, the car should be able to travel 375 miles on a full tank.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using division or some other method.\n\nFor example, if I had the total distance and wanted to find out how much fuel is needed, I could divide the distance by the miles per gallon. But in this case, I have the fuel capacity and the miles per gallon, and I need to find the distance.\n\nSo, multiplication seems to be the correct operation here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. Make sure that the units are consistent. Here, miles per gallon and gallons, so the gallons cancel out, leaving miles, which is what we want.\n\nLet me also check if there's any need to convert units, like gallons to liters or miles to kilometers, but the question is in miles and gallons, and it's acceptable to leave it in those units unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, no conversion is needed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 375 miles.\n\nI think that's straightforward. But it's always good to double-check these things to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]"
