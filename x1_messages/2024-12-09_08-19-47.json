        "content": "Certainly! Here are descriptions for five different species of birds, including details about their size, coloration, habitat, diet, and distinctive behaviors or characteristics.\n\n1. **Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)**\n\n   - **Size:** The Bald Eagle is a large bird, with a body length ranging from 70 to 102 cm (28 to 40 in) and a wingspan of 1.8 to 2.3 m (5.9 to 7.5 ft).

They are social birds, often gathering in large colonies. Known for their waddling gait on land and their ability to withstand extreme cold.\n\n4. **Peacock (Pavo cristatus)**\n\n   - **Size:** Peacocks, the male peafowls, are large and colorful, measuring up to 2.3 m (7.5 ft) in total length, including the train feathers.
