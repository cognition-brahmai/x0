        "content": "So I've got this problem here about planning a new sports stadium. It's going to seat 50,000 people, and it's going to cost $600 million to build. Annual operating expenses are $20 million, and they expect to make an average of $30 per ticket sold. The task is to figure out how many events and how much total attendance they need each year to cover both the construction and operating costs within 10 years.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. They want to cover both the construction cost and the operating costs over 10 years. So, the construction cost is a one-time expense of $600 million, and then there are annual operating expenses of $20 million each year for 10 years.\n\nLet me calculate the total cost over 10 years. That would be the construction cost plus 10 times the annual operating expense.\n\nTotal cost = construction cost + (annual operating expense \u00d7 10 years)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal cost = $600,000,000 + ($20,000,000 \u00d7 10) = $600,000,000 + $200,000,000 = $800,000,000\n\nSo, the total cost over 10 years is $800 million.\n\nNow, they generate revenue from ticket sales. Each ticket brings in $30. So, the total revenue depends on the number of tickets sold, which in turn depends on the number of events and the attendance per event.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- N = number of events per year\n\n- A = average attendance per event\n\nSo, total attendance per year = N \u00d7 A\n\nAnd total revenue per year = (N \u00d7 A) \u00d7 $30\n\nOver 10 years, the total revenue would be 10 \u00d7 (N \u00d7 A \u00d7 $30)\n\nThis total revenue needs to cover the total cost of $800 million.\n\nSo, 10 \u00d7 N \u00d7 A \u00d7 $30 = $800,000,000\n\nI can simplify this equation to find the relationship between N and A.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 10:\n\nN \u00d7 A \u00d7 $30 = $80,000,000\n\nThen, divide both sides by $30:\n\nN \u00d7 A = $80,000,000 / $30 = 2,666,666.67\n\nSo, N \u00d7 A \u2248 2,666,667\n\nMeaning, the product of the number of events per year and the average attendance per event needs to be about 2,666,667.\n\nBut wait, the stadium seats 50,000 people. So, for each event, the maximum attendance is 50,000.\n\nIn reality, they might not sell all seats at every event, but for the sake of this calculation, let's assume they sell all seats at each event.\n\nSo, A = 50,000\n\nThen, N = 2,666,667 / 50,000 = 53.333...\n\nSince the number of events can't be a fraction, they would need to have at least 54 events per year to cover the costs.\n\nBut, this assumes that every event sells all 50,000 seats. If they don't sell all seats, then A would be less than 50,000, which would require more events to make up the difference.\n\nAlternatively, if they can sell more than 50,000 tickets per event somehow, maybe through standing room or other means, but that seems unlikely.\n\nSo, assuming A = 50,000, they need 54 events per year.\n\nBut, it's important to consider that having 54 events per year might not be practical or possible, depending on the types of events and the stadium's availability.\n\nMaybe they can have multiple events per day or extend the event schedule throughout the year, including weekends and holidays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not all events require the full seating capacity. For example, some events might only attract a fraction of the seats.\n\nIn that case, the average attendance A would be less than 50,000, which would require even more events to meet the revenue target.\n\nLet me consider a scenario where the average attendance is only 40,000 per event.\n\nThen, N = 2,666,667 / 40,000 = 66.666...\n\nSo, they would need about 67 events per year.\n\nIf average attendance is 30,000 per event, then N = 2,666,667 / 30,000 \u2248 88.888..., meaning 89 events per year.\n\nThis shows that lower attendance per event requires more events to meet the revenue goal.\n\nConversely, higher attendance allows for fewer events.\n\nBut, there might be limitations on how many events can be hosted per year due to logistical constraints, such as maintenance needs, setup time between events, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, the types of events could affect attendance. High-demand events like major sports competitions or concerts might sell out quickly, while lesser-known events might attract smaller crowds.\n\nTherefore, it's crucial to have a mix of events that can attract different levels of attendance to optimize revenue.\n\nMoreover, the $30 per ticket is an average. Some tickets might be more expensive (premium seats), while others are cheaper (general admission), but for this calculation, using the average seems appropriate.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that the construction cost is spread over 10 years. In reality, there might be financing involved, with interest costs, which could increase the total cost.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't mention interest, I'll assume that the $600 million construction cost is paid upfront or financed in a way that doesn't add extra costs over the 10 years.\n\nAlso, there might be other sources of revenue besides ticket sales, such as merchandise, concessions, sponsorships, and broadcasting rights. If these are significant, they could reduce the reliance on ticket sales to cover costs.\n\nBut, based on the information provided, I have to focus solely on ticket sales.\n\nSo, to summarize, to cover the construction and operating costs over 10 years, the stadium needs to generate a total revenue of $800 million from ticket sales.\n\nGiven that each ticket brings in $30, the total number of tickets that need to be sold over 10 years is $800,000,000 / $30 \u2248 26,666,667 tickets.\n\nTherefore, per year, they need to sell 2,666,667 tickets.\n\nIf each event sells 50,000 tickets, then they need 2,666,667 / 50,000 \u2248 53.33, meaning 54 events per year.\n\nIf average attendance is lower, say 40,000 per event, they would need 67 events per year.\n\nAnd if average attendance is 30,000 per event, they would need 89 events per year.\n\nThis highlights the trade-off between the number of events and the attendance per event.\n\nIn conclusion, the stadium needs to host approximately 54 full-capacity events per year to cover the costs, or a corresponding higher number of events with lower attendance.\n\nThis seems like a lot of events, so the city might need to consider whether this is feasible and sustainable in the long run.\n\n## Final Answer\n\nTo cover both the construction and operating costs within a 10-year timeframe, the stadium needs to generate a total revenue of \\$800 million from ticket sales. Given an average revenue of \\$30 per ticket, the required total attendance over 10 years is approximately 26,666,667 tickets. This translates to 2,666,667 tickets per year.\n\nAssuming each event sells all 50,000 seats, the stadium would need to host about 54 events per year. If the average attendance per event is lower, the number of events required increases accordingly. For example, with an average attendance of 40,000 per event, 67 events per year would be needed, and for 30,000 average attendance, 89 events per year would be required.\n\nTherefore, the stadium should aim for approximately 54 full-capacity events per year to meet the financial targets."
