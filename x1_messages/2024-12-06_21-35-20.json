        "content": "Let's see what's going on here. Mr. Brown gave each of his two sons, Sam and Tim, an envelope with $50 before he left for work. So, both Sam and Tim initially have $50 each.\n\nNow, while Mr. Brown is away, Sam decides to spend his money on video games. So, Sam has spent his $50 on video games, which means he no longer has the money; he\u2019s spent it.\n\nTim, on the other hand, decides to save his money. So, Tim still has his $50 saved.\n\nBut there's a twist: their sister, Lisa, secretly takes $20 from Tim's envelope and uses it to buy a gift for her friend. So, from Tim's envelope, $20 is missing because Lisa took it.\n\nLet's summarize the actual situation:\n\n- Sam spent his $50 on video games, so he has $0 left.\n\n- Tim originally had $50, but Lisa took $20 from him, so he now has $30 left.\n\n- Lisa took $20 from Tim and used it to buy a gift for her friend.\n\nNow, when Mr. Brown returns home, what does he believe about the money he gave his sons?\n\nWell, Mr. Brown doesn't know what happened while he was away. He gave each son $50, so he probably expects that the money is still with them, unless they had a reason to spend it.\n\nBut in reality:\n\n- Sam spent his $50 on video games, so he has no money left.\n\n- Tim has only $30 left because Lisa took $20 from him.\n\nSo, Mr. Brown might be surprised to find out that both of his sons don't have the full $50 he gave them.\n\nMaybe Mr. Brown will ask them about the money, and they'll have to explain what happened.\n\nThis could lead to some interesting conversations, especially when Lisa took money from Tim without his knowledge or permission.\n\nI wonder how Mr. Brown will react to all of this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Mr. Brown believes that both sons still have the $50 each, but in reality, Sam has spent his money on video games and has $0, while Tim has had $20 taken by Lisa and thus has $30 left.}} \\]"
