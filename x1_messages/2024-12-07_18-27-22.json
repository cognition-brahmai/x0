        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a Java program that interacts with Google Cloud Storage. We'll be doing three main tasks here:\n\n1. **Create a new bucket** in Google Cloud Storage.\n\n2. **Upload files** from a local directory to this bucket.\n\n3. **List all the files** in the bucket along with their metadata.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll need to use the Google Cloud Storage client library for Java. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies set up in your project. If you're using Maven, you'll need to add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>\n    <artifactId>google-cloud-storage</artifactId>\n    <version>2.2.4</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nAlso, ensure that you have set up authentication with Google Cloud by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file.\n\nNow, let's break down the program into parts.\n\n### Part 1: Creating a New Bucket\n\nFirst, we need to create a new bucket in Google Cloud Storage. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nimport com.google.cloud.storage.*;\n\npublic class GcsManager {\n\n    private Storage storage;\n\n    public GcsManager() {\n        storage = StorageOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService();\n    }\n\n    public Bucket createBucket(String bucketName) {\n        Bucket bucket = storage.create(BucketInfo.of(bucketName));\n        System.out.println(\"Bucket \" + bucket.getName() + \" created.\");\n        return bucket;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we initialize the `Storage` service and create a new bucket using the `create` method.\n\n### Part 2: Uploading Files from a Local Directory\n\nNext, we'll write a method to upload all files from a specified local directory to the newly created bucket.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\n\npublic class GcsManager {\n\n    // Existing code...\n\n    public void uploadFiles(String bucketName, String localDirectory) throws IOException {\n        Path dirPath = Paths.get(localDirectory);\n        if (!Files.isDirectory(dirPath)) {\n            System.err.println(\"Directory \" + localDirectory + \" does not exist.\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dirPath)) {\n            for (Path file : stream) {\n                if (Files.isRegularFile(file)) {\n                    String objectName = file.getFileName().toString();\n                    BlobId blobId = BlobId.of(bucketName, objectName);\n                    BlobInfo blobInfo = BlobInfo.newBuilder(blobId).build();\n                    storage.create(blobInfo, Files.readAllBytes(file));\n                    System.out.println(\"File \" + objectName + \" uploaded to bucket \" + bucketName + \".\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis method reads all files in the specified directory and uploads each one to the bucket using the `create` method of `BlobInfo`.\n\n### Part 3: Listing Files in the Bucket with Metadata\n\nFinally, we'll list all the files in the bucket and print their metadata.\n\n```java\npublic class GcsManager {\n\n    // Existing code...\n\n    public void listFilesWithMetadata(String bucketName) {\n        Page<Blob> blobs = storage.list(bucketName);\n        for (Blob blob : blobs.iterateAll()) {\n            System.out.println(\"File: \" + blob.getName());\n            System.out.println(\"Size: \" + blob.getSize() + \" bytes\");\n            System.out.println(\"Content Type: \" + blob.getContentType());\n            System.out.println(\"Metadata: \" + blob.getMetadata());\n            System.out.println(\"------------------------\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis method lists all blobs in the bucket and prints their name, size, content type, and metadata.\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\nNow, let's create a main class to orchestrate these operations.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length != 2) {\n            System.err.println(\"Usage: java Main <bucketName> <localDirectory>\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        String bucketName = args[0];\n        String localDirectory = args[1];\n\n        GcsManager manager = new GcsManager();\n\n        // Create bucket\n        manager.createBucket(bucketName);\n\n        // Upload files\n        try {\n            manager.uploadFiles(bucketName, localDirectory);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error uploading files: \" + e.getMessage());\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // List files with metadata\n        manager.listFilesWithMetadata(bucketName);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this main class, we take the bucket name and local directory path as command-line arguments. We then create an instance of `GcsManager` and perform the three operations in sequence.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. **Set up authentication:** Ensure that the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is set to your service account key file.\n\n2. **Compile the program:** Use Maven or your preferred build tool to compile the Java code.\n\n3. **Run the program:** Execute the main class with the bucket name and local directory as arguments.\n\n   ```sh\n   java Main my-new-bucket /path/to/local/directory\n   ```\n\nThis should create a new bucket, upload all files from the specified directory, and list them with their metadata.\n\n### Notes\n\n- **Error Handling:** The current implementation has basic error handling. You might want to enhance it based on your requirements.\n\n- **Concurrency:** For larger directories, consider uploading files in parallel to improve performance.\n\n- **Permissions:** Ensure that the service account has the necessary permissions to create buckets and upload files.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with interacting with Google Cloud Storage using Java!
