        "content": "Yes, turkey meat contains tryptophan, which is an amino acid that can cause drowsiness. However, it's not just turkey that contains tryptophan; other proteins like chicken, cheese, and pork also contain tryptophan. The amount of tryptophan in turkey is similar to that in other proteins, so it's unlikely that eating turkey alone would cause excessive drowsiness. Other factors, such as the size of the meal and accompanying carbohydrates, can also contribute to post-meal sleepiness."
