Plus, what the suspect is believed to have sent to CNN. And another monster storm barreling towards America\\'s northeast. We are not talking inches of snow. We are talking feet upon feet. And Iran releases what it says is decoded footage from a U.S. spy drone. Our American secrets now fully exposed. Let\\'s go OUTFRONT. And good evening to all of you. I\\'m Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we have breaking news, a major development in the massive manhunt underway for a trained killer who is vowing revenge on the Los Angeles Police Department. We are just learning that a burned out truck near Big Bear Lake, which is about 100 miles east of Los Angeles, belongs to Christopher Jordan Dorner. Dorner is the 33-year-old former LAPD officer who has threatened, quote/unquote, \"unconventional and asymmetrical warfare\" on his former colleagues. He\\'s also a former navy reserve lieutenant and he is accused of firing on four officers today, one of them is dead. Dorner is also wanted in connection with a double homicide Sunday in Irvine. Where the daughter of a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain, Monica Quan, and her fiance, Keith Lawrence, were killed in the parking lot of their apartment. Dorner is suspected of being on the run since Sunday, and police warn he is armed and dangerous. And according to a chilling manifesto he posted online, Dorner\\'s twisted shooting spree targeted officers and their families and it isn\\'t over yet. L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is urging his city to remain alert as the manhunt continues tonight. Our Kyung Lah is OUTFRONT in Corona, California, the scene of the first shoot this morning. Kyung, what more can you tell us first about this breaking news we have that they\\'ve been able to identify this burnt vehicle as Dorner\\'s vehicle? KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, just about 90 minutes ago, we did get a report that a car was on fire, that police had found this burned out shell of a vehicle, and there were a lot of questions as to whether or not that\\'s his car. Well, they are now confirming it is, indeed, Chris Dorner\\'s car. Here\\'s what the sheriff\\'s department told reporter just a short time ago. SHERIFF JOHN MCMAHON: We have currently a search going on with guys going door to door, as well as our specialized enforcement detail, up in the area where the truck was located. LAH: Now, that truck was found on a Forestry Road, near Big Bear Lake, as you mentioned, Erin, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. What\\'s happening right now is that fatigue-clad officers are combing through that mountainous region, hoping that they catch up with this ex-police officer -- Erin. BURNETT: And Kyung, as you said, they\\'re hoping and trying to track down that lead as well as others. There\\'s not much daylight left on the west coast, you tell me, another hour, hour and a half. This is crunch time, right? LAH: Yes, you are absolutely right about that. About 90 minutes of daylight left and just so give you an idea of what the officers are facing right now. Big Bear Lake is a mountainous area. It\\'s a resort area. It is very dense, a lot of forestry in that area. There are resorts in that area, as well. So you have people mixed with dense areas. It is very difficult to find somebody. It is, in effect, a perfect hideout, but officers, they have got to find him, if they\\'re going to try to find him tonight. Because after the sun sets, you\\'re talking about tough terrain that could be very dangerous for the police and something we should point out, Erin, there is a storm coming in. It\\'s expected to snow in that area. BURNETT: All right, Kyung Lah, thank you very much. We\\'re going to be with Kyung again later in the hour. In addition to posting his manifesto online, which we\\'re going to be talking a lot about, it\\'s long and detailed and there are a lot of important things in it. Christopher Dorner also reached out directly to CNN. He mailed a parcel to Anderson Cooper\\'s office here at CNN in New York. Anderson is with me now. So, Anderson, I know you get a lot of mail and a lot of strange mail, so it\\'s not something you would have noticed or seen. What was in it? ANDERSON COOPER, HOST, CNN\\'S \"AC 360): It was addressed to me. It got here February 1st, I was just made aware of it earlier today, as well as was CNN management. It was a parcel and in the parcel was probably most notable, a coin. The kind of ceremonial coin that\\'s often handed out in the military. And this one is the former chief of police of the LAPD, Will Bratton\\'s coin. And I talked to Chief Bratton. He says it\\'s likely the suspect got this coin at a ceremony where he gives out these coins to people who are going to be serving overseas. Notable about this coin, there are three bullet holes shot through the center. There\\'s also what looks like the nick of a bullet on the top rim of it. So this was included in the partial. There was also a post-it note, saying, I never lied. There was a DVD and around that coin, there was duct tape. And written on the duct tape was a message for Will Bratton, and also an abbreviation, which we believe is meaning, imagine a more open America, IMOA. BURNETT: And I know Bratton didn\\'t remember Dorner, but apparently according to when Dorner says he was fired, he would have been the police chief who fired him. COOPER: He would have been the police of chief and he did meet him, there\\'s a photograph of him together, but he doesn\\'t recall it. He oversaw thousands of people on the police force. BURNETT: I know it has to be difficult for you. COOPER: It\\'s strange. BURNETT: It\\'s not like you would have seen it. There\\'s no reason you would have seen it, but it takes on more significance. COOPER: Yes, you know, honestly, you get -- I mean, I get death threats and crazy e-mail and crazy letters and parcels all the time. I\\'m sure you do as well. So it comes with the territory. But it\\'s very strange to know that this, you know, this came to our office, and frankly, I didn\\'t even know about it until today. BURNETT: Well, Anderson Cooper, thank you very much. Anderson is going to have a lot more. As he just mentioned, he spoke with former LAPD Chief Bill Bratton, and it was a coin from Bratton, as Anderson just said, that was sent in the parcel. Bratton was the police chief in Los Angeles from 2002 to 2009. And from the manifesto in which Dorner was incredibly specific about dates, he was with the department from 2005 until that time. Listen to Chief Bratton as he explains how Dorner got the coin. BILL BRATTON, FORMER LAPD CHIEF: Chances are he would have received it from me, the photograph that\\'s been displayed very widely today, of me shaking his hand in front of a pair of flags, probably would have been the custom I have of, when somebody was activated into the military, heading overseas, I would bring them up to the office. Present them with one of these coins, as a token of respect and good luck, and also have their family come up to meet our military liaison officer, who would then basically work with the family during the period of time when the officer was gone. So looking at this coin, that is a, what is called a challenge coin, it\\'s my personal coin that I give out to people and the coin\\'s usually about an inch and a half, 2 inches in width. So looks like he probably shot that through with like a .22. BURNETT: I want to bring in Jim Clemente now. He spent 22 years in the FBI, 12 of them as a criminal profiler, and he is OUTFRONT. All right, you\\'ve read the manifesto, and I want to ask you some questions about that. But first, Jim, this package that came to CNN. You hear Bill Bratton talking about the coin. Very chilly, that it looks like it\\'s been shot through by a .22. What do you make of that package? JIM CLEMENTE, ADVISER, \"CRIMINAL MINDS\": I think it\\'s a message, obviously. It\\'s a coin that came from the chief, and I think it\\'s a message directly to him, but also to law enforcement because most law enforcement officers carry those challenge coins. They\\'re part and parcel of what it means to be a police officer, sort of the brotherhood and I think it\\'s very symbolic that he\\'s blowing holes in that. It\\'s a threat. Obviously, this kind of personality is very interested in sort of making a big bang for his buck. And I think it was one more way that he thought he\\'d get more attention for his plight. BURNETT: And I want to talk about the manifesto, which you\\'ve read. We\\'ve all read and in it, there were a couple of things that stood out to you. I want to pull those out. One is where he talks about Rodney King, what he talks about his hatred and anger and resentment at the LAPD. He says, I\\'ll quote him, \"Unfortunately, this is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy, but must partake and compete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name. The department has not changed since the rampart and the Rodney King days. It has gotten worse.\" Then he continues to specifically threaten people. He says, \"I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own. I\\'m going to terminate yours.\" And by the way, there were a whole bunch of names in there I want to know our viewers to know, which we are going to share, because these people\\'s lives are at risk. But what do those two lines say to you about Dorner? CLEMENTE: Well, the first thing about it is that he\\'s trying to become part of something much bigger than him. He knows that his incident is a very small thing in terms of the rest of the world. So he wants to attach himself to the bigger issues that have faced the LAPD in the past, things that have already been resolved. He wants to sort of stir those up, so he can get some more detractors against the LAPD on his side. So it\\'s part of his personality. He feels so small. He feels he has to attach himself to something bigger. The second part, the calls to the family, that\\'s clearly sadistic. What he\\'s trying to do is make somebody suffer even more than he already has. He loves that. That\\'s part of what gets him off as an offender and clearly, what he\\'s interested in, the reason why he\\'s doing this, is to cause as much pain and suffering as possible. BURNETT: OK, there are several names in that sentence. There are a lot of other people to whom he refers. He goes through his grievances. This person was too violent, and I turned them in, and this person said that my complaint had no matter. CLEMENTE: It\\'s always somebody else\\'s fault. BURNETT: All these names are in there. All these people, I mean, is this his list? Is this his kill list? CLEMENTE: Well, it may be. But also, by warning people, he also reduces the chances that he will ever get to these people. BURNETT: Right. CLEMENTE: So what he wants to do is cause anxiety in those people, a much greater number of people than he could actually get to. But what he\\'s doing is, by telegraphing it, he\\'s showing what\\'s really most important to him, which is the notoriety and the fear in other people. BURNETT: Yes. All right, we\\'re going to have a lot more in this manifesto because there\\'s a lot more I want to share with our viewers about what was in here. Thank you very much, Jim. And more to come of our breaking coverage of the manhunt for the suspected killer, he posted an 11,000 manifesto and we will have some of the most important entries for you. Plus, new information about the American drone seized by Iran. The Iranians say they have finally cracked the American code. This is one of the most sophisticated drones ever made by this country. And we\\'re currently tracking a monster blizzard headed towards the northeast. We\\'re going to tell you who is going to get many feet of snow.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 10 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
