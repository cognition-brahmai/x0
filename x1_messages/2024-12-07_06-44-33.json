        "content": "\"Bogan\" is an Australian slang term that originated in the 1980s and has since become a part of the local vernacular. The term is used to describe someone who is considered to be of low social status, often characterized by their lack of sophistication, poor hygiene, and unsophisticated behavior. Bogan culture is often associated with certain fashion choices, such as tracksuits, thongs (flip-flops), and an affinity for cheap beer and fast food. The term can be used both affectionately and derogatorily, depending on the context. It's important to note that like many slang terms, its meaning can vary and evolve over time and across different regions."
