        "content": "So, I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nA factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and each widget has a 5% chance of being defective. Now, if a customer buys 50 widgets, I need to find the approximate probability that they receive at least one defective widget.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. The key phrase is \"at least one defective widget.\" That means the customer gets one or more defective widgets out of the 50 they bought.\n\nProbability can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with \"at least\" scenarios. A common approach is to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, the complementary event of getting at least one defective widget is getting no defective widgets at all in the 50 purchased.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- p = probability of a widget being defective = 5% = 0.05\n\n- q = probability of a widget not being defective = 1 - p = 0.95\n\nNow, assuming that the defects are independent events, which is a reasonable assumption here, the probability that all 50 widgets are not defective is q^50 = 0.95^50.\n\nThen, the probability of getting at least one defective widget is 1 - 0.95^50.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the independence assumption. Since the customer is buying 50 widgets from a daily production of 1000, and assuming the widgets are randomly selected, the defects should be independent.\n\nHowever, in reality, if the factory's defective rate is 5%, and they produce 1000 widgets per day, then in a large number of days, on average, there would be 50 defective widgets per day.\n\nBut for the customer buying 50 widgets, I think the binomial distribution is appropriate here, where n=50 and p=0.05.\n\nSo, the exact probability of getting at least one defective widget is:\n\nP(X \u2265 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n\nWhere X is the number of defective widgets in the sample of 50.\n\nP(X = 0) = (n choose 0) * p^0 * (1-p)^n = 1 * 1 * 0.95^50 \u2248 0.95^50\n\nTherefore, P(X \u2265 1) = 1 - 0.95^50\n\nNow, I need to calculate 0.95^50.\n\nI can use a calculator for this, but let's see if there's an approximate method.\n\nI recall that for small p and large n, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb = n*p.\n\nSo, \u03bb = 50 * 0.05 = 2.5\n\nThen, the probability of getting at least one defective widget is 1 - P(X=0 in Poisson distribution with \u03bb=2.5)\n\nP(X=0) in Poisson is e^(-\u03bb) = e^(-2.5)\n\nTherefore, P(X \u2265 1) = 1 - e^(-2.5)\n\nNow, e^(-2.5) is approximately 0.0821\n\nSo, P(X \u2265 1) \u2248 1 - 0.0821 = 0.9179\n\nAlternatively, using the exact binomial calculation:\n\n0.95^50 \u2248 0.0769\n\nTherefore, P(X \u2265 1) = 1 - 0.0769 = 0.9231\n\nSo, the approximate probability is around 0.9179 using Poisson approximation, and the exact binomial probability is about 0.9231.\n\nThese are quite close, so the approximation is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the approximate probability that the customer receives at least one defective widget is about 92%.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to approximate this?\n\nAnother approach is to use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.\n\nFor large n and when p is not too close to 0 or 1, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean \u03bc = n*p and variance \u03c3^2 = n*p*(1-p)\n\nSo, \u03bc = 50 * 0.05 = 2.5\n\n\u03c3^2 = 50 * 0.05 * 0.95 = 2.375\n\n\u03c3 = sqrt(2.375) \u2248 1.541\n\nThen, to find P(X \u2265 1), we can use the continuity correction and find P(X \u2265 0.5)\n\nStandardizing, Z = (X - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = (0.5 - 2.5)/1.541 \u2248 -1.297\n\nThen, P(Z \u2265 -1.297) = 1 - P(Z < -1.297) = 1 - (1 - P(Z < 1.297)) = P(Z < 1.297)\n\nFrom standard normal tables, P(Z < 1.30) \u2248 0.9147\n\nSo, P(X \u2265 1) \u2248 0.9147\n\nAgain, this is close to the previous approximations.\n\nTherefore, all methods point to a probability of around 91% to 92%.\n\nSo, the approximate probability that the customer receives at least one defective widget is 91.47%.\n\nBut since the question asks for an approximate probability, and considering the different approximation methods give similar results, I can confidently say that the probability is approximately 91.5%.\n\nAlternatively, using the exact binomial calculation, it's about 92.3%.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, 91.5% is a reasonable approximation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 91.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{91.5\\%} \\]"
