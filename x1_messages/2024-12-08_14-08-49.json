        "content": "Let's see here. The train is going at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and I need to find out how many minutes it will take to travel 30 miles. Okay, so first, I know that speed is equal to distance divided by time, right? So, speed = distance / time.\n\nGiven that, I can rearrange that formula to find time, which would be time = distance / speed. So, if the distance is 30 miles and the speed is 60 miles per hour, then time should be 30 miles divided by 60 miles per hour.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 30 divided by 60 is 0.5 hours. But the question asks for minutes, not hours. So, I need to convert hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 0.5 hours times 60 minutes per hour should give me the time in minutes.\n\nSo, 0.5 times 60 is 30 minutes. Therefore, it should take the train 30 minutes to travel 30 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If the train is going at 60 miles per hour, that means it covers 60 miles in 60 minutes. So, for every 60 miles, it takes 60 minutes. Therefore, for 30 miles, which is half of 60 miles, it should take half the time, which is 30 minutes. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find out how many minutes it takes to travel one mile and then multiply by 30. So, at 60 miles per hour, it takes 1 minute to travel 1 mile because 60 miles in 60 minutes. So, for 30 miles, it would be 30 minutes. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer should be 30 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
