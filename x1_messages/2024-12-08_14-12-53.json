        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, initially, the factory produces 1000 widgets per day, and each widget weighs 5 pounds. That means the total daily production in pounds is 1000 widgets times 5 pounds per widget, which is 5000 pounds.\n\nNow, the factory increases its production by 50%. To find the new production amount, I need to calculate 50% of 1000 widgets and add that to the original 1000. Fifty percent of 1000 is 500, so the new production is 1000 + 500 = 1500 widgets per day.\n\nAt the same time, the weight of each widget is reduced by 25%. So, if each widget originally weighs 5 pounds, a 25% reduction in weight means each widget now weighs 5 pounds minus 25% of 5 pounds. Twenty-five percent of 5 is 1.25 pounds, so the new weight per widget is 5 - 1.25 = 3.75 pounds.\n\nNow, to find the total daily production in pounds after these changes, I need to multiply the new number of widgets by the new weight per widget. That's 1500 widgets times 3.75 pounds per widget.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 1500 times 3.75.\n\nFirst, 1500 times 3 is 4500.\n\nThen, 1500 times 0.75 is 1125.\n\nAdding those together, 4500 + 1125 equals 5625 pounds.\n\nSo, after increasing production by 50% and reducing the weight of each widget by 25%, the factory will produce 5625 pounds of widgets daily.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, the production increases by 50%, which is the same as multiplying by 1.5, and the weight per widget decreases by 25%, which is the same as multiplying by 0.75.\n\nSo, the total change in production in pounds is the original production multiplied by 1.5 multiplied by 0.75.\n\nOriginal production is 5000 pounds.\n\nSo, 5000 times 1.5 is 7500.\n\nThen, 7500 times 0.75 is 5625 pounds.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can verify this with another approach.\n\nOriginally, it's 1000 widgets at 5 pounds each, totaling 5000 pounds.\n\nAfter a 50% increase in production, it's 1500 widgets.\n\nEach widget is now 25% lighter, so 75% of the original weight, which is 3.75 pounds.\n\nSo, 1500 widgets times 3.75 pounds equals 5625 pounds.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of percentages.\n\nA 50% increase in production and a 25% decrease in weight per widget.\n\nSo, the net effect on total production in pounds is 150% of the original production multiplied by 75% of the original weight per widget.\n\nThat is, 1.5 times 0.75 equals 1.125, or a 12.5% increase from the original production in pounds.\n\nOriginal production was 5000 pounds, so 5000 times 1.125 is 5625 pounds.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 5625 pounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5625} \\]"
