        "content": "That would be Victor Hugo. He was a giant in French literature, and those two works you mentioned are indeed his most famous. Les Mis\u00e9rables is a monumental work that delves into the lives of characters like Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert, exploring themes of redemption, justice, and the impact of social conditions. Notre-Dame de Paris, set in medieval Paris, tells the story of the deformed bell-ringer Quasimodo and the gypsy Esmeralda, and it's renowned for its vivid portrayal of Paris and its historical setting. Both novels have had a profound influence on literature and have been adapted into numerous films and stage productions, including the hugely popular musical \"Les Mis\u00e9rables.\""
