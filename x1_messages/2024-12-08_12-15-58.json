Tolkien's epic fantasy series, Gollum, originally known as Sm\u00e9agol, is a Stoor Hobbit who becomes consumed by the One Ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron. The ring's power corrupts Sm\u00e9agol, turning him into the twisted, bitter creature known as Gollum. His obsession with the ring is all-consuming, driving his every thought and action.\n\nGollum's fixation on the ring is multifaceted. On one level, it's a physical dependency; the ring's power has permeated his being, making him dependent on it for his survival and identity. He refers to it as \"my precious,\" a term that reflects both his possessiveness and his deep-seated need for the object.\n\nMoreover, the ring represents power and control to Gollum. In his darker moments, he dreams of using it to regain dominance over others, to have what he perceives as his rightful place in the world. This desire for power is a common theme in Tolkien's work, illustrating how even the smallest and most humble can be tempted by the allure of authority.\n\nGollum's obsession also stems from a sense of loss and longing. The ring was taken from him by Bilbo Baggins, an event that fuels his hatred and desire for revenge. This loss has shaped his entire existence, leading him to track down the ring at any cost, even if it means traversing dangerous terrains and facing his own demons.\n\nFurthermore, the ring serves as a symbol of identity for Gollum. Without it, he fears he is nothing, lost and alone in a world that has forgotten him. The ring gives him a purpose, a reason to continue living, twisted and broken though he may be.\n\nIn summary, Gollum's obsession with the ring is a complex interplay of physical dependency, desire for power, unresolved emotions, and a search for identity. It's a chilling portrayal of how an object can consume a being, twisting it beyond recognition and driving it to extremes."
