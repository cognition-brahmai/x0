        "content": "Certainly! To reverse a string in C++ without using any built-in functions or libraries, you can manually swap characters from the beginning and the end of the string until you reach the middle. Here's how you can implement such a function:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid reverseString(char str[]) {\n    int length = 0;\n    // Find the length of the string\n    while (str[length] != '\\0') {\n        length++;\n    }\n    \n    // Swap characters from start and end\n    for (int i = 0; i < length / 2; i++) {\n        char temp = str[i];\n        str[i] = str[length - i - 1];\n        str[length - i - 1] = temp;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char str[] = \"Hello, World!\";\n    std::cout << \"Original string: \" << str << std::endl;\n    reverseString(str);\n    std::cout << \"Reversed string: \" << str << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Finding the Length:** We first determine the length of the string by iterating through it until we reach the null character `'\\0'`.\n2. **Swapping Characters:** We then use a loop to swap characters from the start and the end, moving towards the center of the string. This is done by iterating from `0` to `length/2 - 1`.\n3. **Updating the String:** The swaps are performed in place, modifying the original string.\n\nThis approach ensures that the string is reversed efficiently without relying on any built-in functions or external libraries."
