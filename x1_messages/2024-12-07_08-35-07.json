        "content": "This sounds like a riddle! Let me try to solve it. So, the clues are:\n\n1. \"Bright as diamonds\" - Diamonds are known for their brilliance and sparkle.\n\n2. \"Loud as thunder\" - Thunder is very loud and can be heard from a distance.\n\n3. \"Never still\" - This suggests constant movement or activity.\n\n4. \"A thing of wonder\" - It's something that inspires awe or amazement.\n\nPutting these clues together, I'm thinking of something that is bright, loud, always moving, and remarkable. Could it be lightning? Lightning is bright like diamonds, loud like thunder, never still as it flashes quickly, and it's certainly a thing of wonder in nature.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a firework display. Fireworks are bright, loud, always moving as they explode in the sky, and they are wonderful to watch.\n\nBut considering the reference to thunder, lightning seems more fitting. What do you think?"
