        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So, in total, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 balls in the bag. The question is about drawing two balls without replacement and both being red. Okay, so without replacement means that once I draw the first ball, it stays out, and then I draw the second ball from the remaining balls.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing two red balls in a row without replacing the first one.\n\nSo, let's break this down into steps. Step one: draw the first ball. The probability that it's red is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. There are 4 red balls and 9 balls in total, so the probability is 4/9.\n\nNow, step two: draw the second ball without replacing the first one. Since I've already drawn one red ball, there are now 3 red balls left and a total of 8 balls remaining in the bag. So, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 3/8.\n\nBut since these are two consecutive events without replacement, I need to find the combined probability of both events happening. To find the probability of both events occurring, I multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the overall probability is (4/9) multiplied by (3/8). Let's calculate that:\n\n(4/9) * (3/8) = (4*3) / (9*8) = 12 / 72 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use combinations. The total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 9 is calculated using combinations, which is denoted as C(9,2). Similarly, the number of ways to draw 2 red balls out of 4 is C(4,2). So, the probability is C(4,2) divided by C(9,2).\n\nLet's calculate that. C(4,2) is (4!)/(2!(4-2)!) = (4*3*2*1)/(2*1*(2*1)) = (24)/(4) = 6.\n\nC(9,2) is (9!)/(2!(9-2)!) = (9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1)/(2*1*(7*6*5*4*3*2*1)) = (362880)/(2*5040) = (362880)/(10080) = 36.\n\nSo, the probability is 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier calculation. So, the probability is indeed 1/6.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Suppose I think about the probabilities step by step again.\n\nFirst draw: probability of red is 4/9.\n\nSecond draw: if the first was red, then probability of second red is 3/8.\n\nMultiplying them gives (4/9)*(3/8) = 12/72 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the order matters, but since we're drawing without replacement and we want both to be red, the order doesn't change the final probability in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could calculate the probability of drawing two red balls in any order, but since it's without replacement, and both need to be red, it's the same as the previous calculations.\n\nI could also consider the probability of drawing two red balls as a single event, which is what I did using combinations.\n\nEither way, I end up with 1/6.\n\nLet me see if there's any other factor I should consider. Is there anything in the problem that I might have missed?\n\nThe problem says \"drawing two balls without replacement and both being red.\" It doesn't specify any other conditions, like the balls being drawn simultaneously or sequentially, but since it's without replacement, it's sequential.\n\nAlso, it's assumed that each ball is equally likely to be drawn, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, I think 1/6 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the total number of ways to draw two red balls and divide by the total number of ways to draw any two balls.\n\nWe already did that using combinations: C(4,2)/C(9,2) = 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total number of ways to draw two red balls as 4 choices for the first ball and 3 for the second, but since the order doesn't matter, I have to divide by 2! to account for the permutations.\n\nWait, no. If I'm considering ordered draws, then it's 4 choices for the first and 3 for the second, totaling 12 ordered pairs.\n\nThe total number of ordered pairs for any two balls is 9 choices for the first and 8 for the second, totaling 72.\n\nSo, 12/72 = 1/6.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider unordered pairs, it's C(4,2) = 6 for red balls and C(9,2) = 36 for total balls, giving 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nSo, regardless of whether I consider ordered or unordered pairs, I end up with the same probability.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the probability of drawing two red balls without replacement is 1/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
