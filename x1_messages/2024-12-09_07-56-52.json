        "content": "So I've got this problem to figure out how many disposable gloves a big hospital uses in a month. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how many gloves each healthcare worker uses. The problem says that on average, each worker uses six pairs of gloves per shift. Okay, so per shift, it's six pairs.\n\nBut wait, pairs mean two gloves each, right? So six pairs would be twelve gloves per shift per worker. Hmm, but the question might be considering pairs as standard, so maybe I should keep it in pairs for now and see.\n\nNext, there are 1,200 healthcare workers in the hospital, and they work in three shifts, each lasting eight hours. So, that means that the hospital has three groups of workers working at different times, but the total workforce is 1,200.\n\nWait a minute, does that mean that all 1,200 workers are spread across the three shifts, or is it that each shift has 1,200 workers? That would be a lot of people! Probably, the total number of workers is 1,200, and they are divided into three shifts.\n\nSo, if there are three shifts, then the number of workers per shift would be 1,200 divided by 3, which is 400 workers per shift.\n\nAlright, so each shift has 400 workers, and each worker uses six pairs of gloves per shift. So, the number of pairs used per shift would be 400 workers times six pairs, which is 2,400 pairs per shift.\n\nBut since each pair is two gloves, the total number of gloves per shift would be 2,400 pairs times two, which is 4,800 gloves per shift.\n\nNow, each worker works five days a week. So, in a week, each worker works five days, and each day they work one shift of eight hours.\n\nWait, but since there are three shifts in a day, and each worker is assigned to one shift, then yes, each worker works the same shift every day they work.\n\nNow, there are four weeks in a month, so in a month, each worker works five days a week times four weeks, which is 20 days a month.\n\nTherefore, each worker works 20 shifts a month.\n\nSince each shift uses six pairs per worker, then per month, each worker uses six pairs times 20 shifts, which is 120 pairs per worker per month.\n\nAgain, since each pair is two gloves, that's 240 gloves per worker per month.\n\nNow, with 1,200 workers, the total number of gloves used per month would be 1,200 workers times 240 gloves per worker, which is 288,000 gloves per month.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated that per shift, it's 4,800 gloves, and there are three shifts per day, so daily total would be 4,800 gloves per shift times three shifts, which is 14,400 gloves per day.\n\nThen, in a month with four weeks, and each week has seven days, that's 28 days in a month.\n\nSo, 14,400 gloves per day times 28 days would be 403,200 gloves per month.\n\nHmm, but earlier I got 288,000 gloves per month. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me check where I went wrong.\n\nOh, I see the mistake. The problem says there are three shifts, each lasting eight hours, and there are 1,200 healthcare workers working in these three shifts.\n\nIf the 1,200 workers are divided into three shifts, then each shift has 400 workers, as I calculated earlier.\n\nEach shift, 400 workers use six pairs each, so 400 times six pairs is 2,400 pairs per shift.\n\nEach pair is two gloves, so 2,400 pairs times two is 4,800 gloves per shift.\n\nThere are three shifts per day, so daily usage is 4,800 gloves per shift times three shifts, which is 14,400 gloves per day.\n\nNow, assuming a month has four weeks, and each week has seven days, then the number of days in a month is four times seven, which is 28 days.\n\nTherefore, monthly usage would be 14,400 gloves per day times 28 days, which is 403,200 gloves per month.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated based on each worker's monthly usage, I got 288,000 gloves per month. That doesn't match. There must be a mistake in one of these approaches.\n\nLet me re-examine the per-worker calculation.\n\nEach worker works five days a week, and there are four weeks in a month, so 5 times 4 is 20 days per month.\n\nEach day, they work one shift and use six pairs, which is 12 gloves per shift.\n\nSo, per month, per worker: 20 shifts times 12 gloves equals 240 gloves.\n\nTotal for 1,200 workers: 1,200 times 240 equals 288,000 gloves per month.\n\nWait, but according to the other method, it's 403,200 gloves per month. There's a discrepancy of 115,200 gloves.\n\nI think I see the issue. In the per-shift calculation, I assumed that all three shifts are working every day of the month, including weekends.\n\nBut in the per-worker calculation, each worker works five days a week, meaning they have two days off per week.\n\nSo, in the per-shift calculation, if I assume three shifts per day for 28 days in a month, that's counting shifts on weekends as well.\n\nBut if workers only work five days a week, then over four weeks, they work 20 days, not 28.\n\nSo, the correct approach should align with the workers' actual working days.\n\nTherefore, the total number of worker-shifts per month is 1,200 workers times 20 shifts per worker, which is 24,000 worker-shifts per month.\n\nEach worker-shift uses six pairs, which is 12 gloves.\n\nTherefore, total gloves used per month is 24,000 worker-shifts times 12 gloves, which is 288,000 gloves.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each shift has 400 workers (1,200 divided by three), and each shift uses 400 times six pairs, which is 2,400 pairs or 4,800 gloves per shift.\n\nIf each shift happens once per day, and workers work five days a week for four weeks, that's 20 shifts per worker.\n\nBut since there are three shifts per day, and workers are divided into three groups, each group works their shift five days a week for four weeks, which is 20 shifts.\n\nSo, total shifts in a month are three shifts per day times 20 days (since workers work 20 days), which is 60 shifts.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each worker works 20 shifts, and there are three shifts per day, but the total shifts depend on how many days the hospital operates.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nThe hospital operates three shifts per day, every day.\n\nSo, in a 28-day month, there are three shifts per day, totaling 84 shifts in a month.\n\nEach shift has 400 workers, each using six pairs or 12 gloves.\n\nSo, per shift, 400 workers times 12 gloves equals 4,800 gloves.\n\nTotal for 84 shifts: 84 times 4,800 equals 403,200 gloves.\n\nBut according to the per-worker calculation, it's 288,000 gloves.\n\nThere's that discrepancy again.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether all shifts are staffed every day, including weekends, or if workers have days off.\n\nGiven that workers work five days a week, meaning they have two days off per week, the hospital still runs three shifts per day, every day, but different workers cover those shifts.\n\nSo, the total glove usage should be based on the number of shifts operated in a month, not just the shifts worked by individual workers.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to calculate based on the hospital's operation, not the individual workers' schedules.\n\nSo, the hospital has three shifts per day, 28 days in a month, totaling 84 shifts.\n\nEach shift has 400 workers, each using six pairs or 12 gloves.\n\nThus, total gloves used per month is 84 shifts times 4,800 gloves per shift, which is 403,200 gloves.\n\nThe per-worker calculation is misleading because it doesn't account for the hospital's continuous operation across all days of the month, while workers rotate their shifts and have days off.\n\nTherefore, the accurate total is 403,200 gloves per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{403200} \\]"
