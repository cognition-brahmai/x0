        "content": "Let's see. The company has an annual revenue of $2,500,000. It spends 40% on salaries, 25% on rent, and 15% on marketing. I need to find out how much is left for other expenses or profit.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much is spent on each of these categories.\n\nStarting with salaries:\n\n40% of $2,500,000 is:\n\n(40/100) * 2,500,000 = 0.4 * 2,500,000 = $1,000,000\n\nNext, rent:\n\n25% of $2,500,000 is:\n\n(25/100) * 2,500,000 = 0.25 * 2,500,000 = $625,000\n\nThen, marketing:\n\n15% of $2,500,000 is:\n\n(15/100) * 2,500,000 = 0.15 * 2,500,000 = $375,000\n\nNow, I'll add up these expenses:\n\nSalaries: $1,000,000\n\nRent: $625,000\n\nMarketing: $375,000\n\nTotal spent so far: 1,000,000 + 625,000 + 375,000 = $2,000,000\n\nThe annual revenue is $2,500,000, so the amount left for other expenses or profit is:\n\n2,500,000 - 2,000,000 = $500,000\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total percentage spent on salaries, rent, and marketing:\n\n40% + 25% + 15% = 80%\n\nSo, 80% of the revenue is spent on these categories, leaving 20% for other expenses or profit.\n\nTo find 20% of $2,500,000:\n\n(20/100) * 2,500,000 = 0.2 * 2,500,000 = $500,000\n\nEither way, the amount left is $500,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500000} \\]"
