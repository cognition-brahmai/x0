All well, my sovereign liege, except some few That are deceas'd by fortune of the war.\nKING. But what portends thy cheerful countenance And posting to our presence thus in haste? Speak, man: hath fortune given us victory?\nGEN. Victory, my liege, and that with little loss.\nKING. Our Portugals will pay us tribute then?\nGEN. Tribute, and wonted homage therewithal.\nKING. Then blest be Heav'n, and Guider of the heav'ns, From whose fair influence such justice flows!\nCAST. O multum dilecte Deo, tibi militat aether, Et conjuratae curvato poplite gentes Succumbunt: recti soror est victoria juris!\nKING. Thanks to my loving brother of Castille. But, general, unfold in brief discourse Your form of battle and your war's success, That, adding all the pleasure of thy news Unto the height of former happiness, With deeper wage and gentle dignity We may reward thy blissful chivalry.\nGEN. Where Spain and Portingal do jointly knit Their frontiers, leaning on each other's bound, There met our armies in the proud array: Both furnish'd well, both full of hope and fear, Both menacing alike with daring shows, Both vaunting sundry colours of device, Both cheerly sounding trumpets, drums and fifes, Both raising dreadful clamors to the sky, That valleys, hills, and rivers made rebound And heav'n itself was frighted with the sound. Our battles both were pitch'd in squadron form, Each corner strongly fenc'd with wings of shot; But, ere we join'd and came to push of pike, I brought a squadron of our readiest shot From out our rearward to begin the fight; They brought another wing to encounter us; Meanwhile our ordnance play'd on either side, And captains strove to have their valours try'd. Don Pedro, their chief horsemen's colonel, Did with his cornet bravely make attempt To break the order of our battle ranks; But Don Rogero, worthy man of war, March'd forth against him with our musketeers And stopp'd the malice of his fell approach. While they maintain hot skirmish to and fro, Both battles join and fall to handy blows, Their violent shot resembling th' oceans rage When, roaring loud and with a swelling tide, It beats upon the rampiers of huge rocks, And gapes to swallow neighbor-bounding lands. Now, while Bellona rageth here and there, Thick storms of bullets ran like winter's hail, And shiver'd lances dark the troubled air; Pede pes & cuspide cuspis, Arma sonant armis, vir petiturque viro; On every side drop captains to the ground, And soldiers, some ill-maim'd, some slain outright: Here falls a body sunder'd from his head; There legs and arms lie bleeding on the grass, Mingled with weapons and unbowel'd steeds, That scattering over-spread the purple plain. In all this turmoil, three long hours and more The victory to neither part inclin'd, Till Don Andrea with his brave lancers In their main battle made so great a breach That, half dismay'd, the multitude retir'd. But Balthazar, the Portingales' young prince, Brought rescue and encourag'd them to stay. Here-hence the fight was eagerly renew'd, And in that conflict was Andrea slain,-- Brave man-at-arms, but weak to Balthazar. Yet, while the prince, insulting over him, Breath'd out proud vaunts, sounding to our reproach, Friendship and hardy valour join'd in one Prick'd forth Horatio, our knight-marshall's son, To challenge forth that prince in single fight. Not long between these twain the fight endur'd, But straight the prince was beaten from his horse And forc'd to yield him prisoner to his foe. When he was taken, all the rest fled, And our carbines pursu'd them to death, Till, Phoebus waning to the western deep, Our trumpeters were charg'd to sound retreat.\nKING. Thanks, good lord general, for these good news! And, for some argument of more to come, Take this and wear it for thy sovereign's sake.\nGive him his chain.\nBut tell me now: hast thou confirm'd a peace?\nGEN. No peace, my liege, but peace conditional, That, if with homage tribute be well paid, The fury of your forces will be stay'd. And to this peace their viceroy hath subscrib'd,\nGive the King a paper.\nAnd made a solemn vow that during life His tribute shall be truly paid to Spain.\nKING. These words, these deeds become thy person well. But now, knight-marshall, frolic with thy king, For 'tis thy son that wins this battle's prize.\nHIERO. Long may he live to serve my sovereign liege! And soon decay unless he serve my liege!\nA trumpet afar off.\nKING. Nor thou nor he shall die without reward. What means this warning of this trumpet's sound?\nGEN. This tells me that your Grace's men of war, Such as war's fortune hath reserv'd from death, Come marching on towards your royal seat, To show themselves before your Majesty; For so gave I in charge at my depart. Whereby by demonstration shall appear That all, except three hundred or few more, Are safe return'd and by their foes enrich'd.\nThe army enters, BALTHAZAR between LORENZO and HORATIO, captive.\nKING. A gladsome sight! I long to see them here.\nThey enter and pass by.\nWas that the warlike prince of Portingal That by our nephew was in triumph led?\nGEN. It was, my liege, the prince of Portingal.\nKING. But what was he that on the other side Held him by th' arm as partner of the prize?\nHIERO. That was my son, my gracious sovereign; Of whom though from his tender infancy My loving thoughts did never hope but well, He never pleasd his father's eyes till now, Nor fill'd my heart with overcloying joys.\nKING. Go, let them march once more about these walls, That staying them we may confer and talk With our brave prisoner and his double guard.\n[Exit a MESSENGER.]\nHieoronimo, it greatly pleaseth us That in our victory thou have a share By virtue of thy worthy son's exploit.\nEnter again.\nBring hither the young prince of Portingal! The rest march on, but, ere they be dismiss'd, We will bestow on every soldier Two ducats, and on every leader ten, That they may know our largesse welcomes them.\nExeunt all [the army] but BAL[THAZAR], LOR[ENZO], and HOR[ATIO].\nKING. Welcome, Don Balthazar! Welcome nephew! And thou, Horatio, thou art welcome too! Young prince, although thy father's hard misdeeds In keeping back the tribute that he owes Deserve but evil measure at our hands, Yet shalt thou know that Spain is honourable.\nBALT. The trespass that my father made in peace Is now controll'd by fortune of the wars; And cards once dealt, it boots not ask why so. His men are slain,--a weakening to his realm; His colours seiz'd,--a blot unto his name; His son distress'd,--a corsive to his heart; These punishments may clear his late offence.\nKING. Aye, Balthazar, if he observe this truce, Our peace will grow the stronger for these wars. Meanwhile live thou, though not in liberty, Yet free from bearing any servile yoke; For in our hearing thy deserts were great. And in our sight thyself art gracious.\nBALT. And I shall study to deserve this grace.\nKING. But tell me,--for their holding makes me doubt: To which of these twain art thou prisoner?\nLOR. To me, my liege.\nHOR. To me, my sovereign.\nLOR. This hand first took his courser by the reins.\nHOR. But first my lance did put him from his horse.\nLOR. I seiz'd the weapon and enjoy'd it first.\nHOR. But first I forc'd him lay his weapons down.\nKING. Let go his arm, upon my privilege!\nLet him go.\nSay, worthy prince: to whether didst thou yield?\nBALT. To him in courtesy; to this perforce; He spake me fair, this other gave me strokes; He promis'd life, this other threaten'd death; He won my love, this other conquer'd me; And, truth to say, I yield myself to both.\nHIERO. But that I know your Grace is just and wise, And might seem partial in this difference, Enforc'd by nature and by law of arms, My tongue should plead for young Horatio's right. He hunted well that was a lion's death, Not he that in a garment wore his skin; So hares may pull dead lions by the beard.\nKING. Content thee, marshall; thou shalt have no wrong, And for thy sake thy son shall want to right. Will both abide the censure of my doom?\nLOR. I crave no better than your Grace awards.\nHOR. Nor I, although I sit beside my right.\nKING. Then by judgment thus your strife shall end: You both deserve and both shall have reward. Nephew, thou took'st his weapons and his horse: His weapons and his horse are thy reward. Horatio, thou did'st force him first to yield: His ransom therefore is thy valour's fee; Appoint the sum as you shall both agree. But, nephew, thou shalt have the prince in guard, For thine estate best fitteth such a guest; Horatio's house were small for all his train. Yet, in regard thy substance passeth his, And that just guerdon may befall desert, To him we yield the armour of the prince. How likes Don Balthazar of this device?\nBALT. Right well, my liege, if this proviso were: That Don Horatio bear us company, Whom I admire and love for chivalry.\nKING. Horatio, leave him not that loves thee so. Now let us hence, to see our soldiers paid, And feast our prisoner as our friendly guest.\nExeunt.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 430 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"

        "content": "So, I've got this piece of text here, and I need to summarize it in about 430 words. It seems like it's from a play, probably an old one, given the language and the names. There are characters like the Spanish King, a General, someone from Castille, and Hieronimo. There's also mention of Portugal and some battles. Let's see.\n\nThe scene opens with the Spanish King, the General, a representative from Castille, and Hieronimo entering. The King asks the General about the state of their camp, and the General reports that everything is well, except for some casualties from the war. The King is curious about the General's cheerful demeanor and haste in approaching him. He wants to know if fortune has brought them victory.\n\nThe General confirms that they have indeed achieved victory with minimal loss. The King then inquires if this means that Portugal will now pay tribute to Spain. The General assures him that not only will Portugal pay tribute, but also offer homage. The King expresses his gratitude to Heaven and the guiding force behind their success.\n\nCastille, another character present, adds some lines in Latin, praising the beloved of God, whose heavens wage war and make nations submit with bended knees. The King thanks his brother of Castille and asks the General to provide a brief account of how the battle unfolded and how they achieved success. He wants to reward the General appropriately for his blissful chivalry.\n\nThe General proceeds to describe the battle in detail. It seems that the Spanish and Portuguese armies met at a point where their frontiers join. Both armies were well-prepared, filled with hope and fear, and presented impressive displays of military might. They had various squadrons, wings of shooters, and their artillery was active.\n\nThe General mentions that he brought a squadron of musketeers from the rear to initiate the fight, and the Portuguese responded with their own wing. There was heavy skirmishing, and the battles joined with soldiers engaging in close combat. There were many casualties, with bodies, limbs, and weapons scattered across the field.\n\nDuring the heat of the battle, Don Andrea, a Spanish captain, made a significant breach in the Portuguese main battle line, causing their troops to retreat. However, the Portuguese prince, Balthazar, rallied his troops and renewed the fight. In the ensuing conflict, Don Andrea was slain by Balthazar. But then, Horatio, the son of the knight-marshall, challenged and defeated Balthazar in single combat, taking him prisoner. With the prince captured, the rest of the Portuguese army fled, and the Spanish pursued them until evening fell.\n\nThe King is pleased with the news and rewards the General with a chain. He asks if a peace treaty has been established, and the General says that there is a conditional peace, wherein Portugal agrees to pay tribute and homage to Spain. The Portuguese viceroy has subscribed to this peace.\n\nThe King is grateful and turns to Hieronimo, commending him for his son's valor in the battle. Hieronimo expresses his pride in his son, saying that he has never been more pleased with him.\n\nAt this point, a trumpet is heard in the distance, signaling the approach of the Spanish army returning from the battle. The King recognizes it and expresses his eagerness to see them. The General explains that this is in accordance with his earlier orders, and that the army is marching towards the royal seat to be inspected by the King.\n\nSoon, the army enters, with Balthazar, the Portuguese prince, being led between Lorenzo and Horatio, both of whom are Spanish nobles and presumably the captors of Balthazar. The King notes the presence of the prince and inquires about the individual who was leading him on the other side. It turns out to be Horatio, the son of Hieronimo.\n\nThe King orders that the army march once more around the walls so that he can confer with the prisoner and his captors. He also decides to reward the soldiers with money: two ducats for each soldier and ten for each leader, to show his generosity.\n\nOnce the army passes by again, the King asks to speak with Balthazar, dismissing the rest of the army. He welcomes Balthazar and his nephew Lorenzo and Horatio. He acknowledges that Balthazar's father had withheld the tribute owed to Spain, but given the fortune of war, he is willing to show mercy.\n\nBalthazar accepts responsibility for his father's actions and sees the punishments meted out\u2014loss of men, capture of colors, and his own capture\u2014as sufficient recompense for the past transgressions.\n\nThe King assures Balthazar that if his father adheres to the truce, their peace will be stronger because of these wars. For now, Balthazar will be treated with honor, even if not fully free.\n\nA debate then arises between Lorenzo and Horatio about who should be considered Balthazar's captor, as both claim to have played a crucial role in his capture. Lorenzo says he first took Balthazar's horse, while Horatio claims he was the one who forced Balthazar to yield by unhorsing him.\n\nThe King intervenes, telling them to let go of Balthazar and asks the prince to whom he yielded. Balthazar explains that he yielded in courtesy to one and perforce to the other. He appreciated the courtesy of one and was forced to yield to the other. He acknowledges that both played a role.\n\nHieronimo, the knight-marshall, wants to speak up for his son Horatio's right, but refrains, trusting in the King's justice. He makes a point about merit and the recognition of valor.\n\nThe King decides to settle the dispute by awarding both Lorenzo and Horatio their due. He gives Lorenzo the prince's weapons and horse, as he was the one who took them. He assigns the ransom money from Balthazar to Horatio, as he was the one who forced the prince to yield. Additionally, he assigns the responsibility of guarding Balthazar to Lorenzo, considering his estate is more suitable for hosting such a guest. However, he notes that Lorenzo's wealth exceeds Horatio's, and to balance the rewards, he gives Horatio the prince's armor.\n\nBalthazar then requests that Horatio accompany him, as he admires and loves him for his chivalry. The King suggests that Horatio should not leave someone who loves him so much, and orders Horatio to stay with Balthazar.\n\nFinally, the King announces that they should proceed to see the soldiers being paid and to feast the prisoner as a friendly guest.\n\nAnd that's the end of this scene. It's quite detailed, with a lot of military and political elements, as well as family dynamics and recognition of valor in battle.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nIn this scene from a play set in a Spanish court, the King and his nobles, including the General, Castille, and Hieronimo, discuss the outcome of a war with Portugal. The General reports a victory with minimal losses and presents a conditional peace treaty requiring Portugal to pay tribute and homage to Spain. The King rewards the General and commends Hieronimo for his son Horatio's bravery in battle.\n\nThe scene shifts as the Spanish army returns, bringing captive the Portuguese Prince Balthazar, captured by Horatio and Lorenzo. A dispute arises between Horatio and Lorenzo over who should be considered Balthazar's captor, each claiming different acts in the capture. The King resolves the dispute by awarding both: Lorenzo receives Balthazar's weapons and horse, and Horatio gets the ransom money. The King also assigns Lorenzo to guard Balthazar, considering his estate more suitable, but allows Horatio to accompany them due to Balthazar's request.\n\nThe King then plans to reward the soldiers and feast the prisoner as a guest, signifying the end of hostilities and the beginning of a peaceful relationship with Portugal. The scene highlights themes of honor, bravery, and the politics of war and peace in the context of 16th-century European nobility.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Military Victory:** Spain defeats Portugal in battle, leading to a conditional peace where Portugal agrees to pay tribute and homage.\n\n- **Captivity of Prince Balthazar:** The Portuguese prince is captured by Horatio and Lorenzo, leading to a debate over who is the rightful captor.\n\n- **King's Judgment:** The King resolves the captor dispute by granting both Lorenzo and Horatio rewards, balancing honors and material gains.\n\n- **Future Relations:** The King plans to treat Balthazar honorably, signaling a move towards peace and amity with Portugal.\n\nThis scene is rich in political and familial dynamics, showcasing the recognition of military achievements and the diplomatic handling of captives in a historical context."
