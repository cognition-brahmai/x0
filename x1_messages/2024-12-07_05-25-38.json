        "content": "So I've got this quadratic equation to solve by factoring: x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0. I need to show my work step by step. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that factoring a quadratic equation means expressing it as a product of two binomials. The general form of a quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, and in this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = 6.\n\nSo, I need to find two numbers that multiply to give 'c' (which is 6), and add up to give 'b' (which is -5). Because the coefficient of x is negative and the constant term is positive, both numbers should be negative.\n\nLet me think about the factors of 6:\n\n- 1 and 6\n\n- 2 and 3\n\nSince both numbers need to be negative and their sum should be -5, let's consider:\n\n- (-1) and (-6): Their product is 6 and their sum is -7.\n\n- (-2) and (-3): Their product is 6 and their sum is -5.\n\nPerfect! (-2) and (-3) are the numbers I need.\n\nNow, I can rewrite the middle term (-5x) using these two numbers:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x - 3x + 6 = 0\n\nNext, I'll group the terms:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 2x) + (-3x + 6) = 0\n\nNow, factor out the greatest common factor from each group:\n\nx(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0\n\nI can see that (x - 2) is a common factor in both terms. So, I'll factor that out:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nNow, to find the solutions, I set each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 2 = 0 \u21d2 x = 2\n\nx - 3 = 0 \u21d2 x = 3\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nTo verify, I can plug these values back into the original equation:\n\nFor x = 2:\n\n(2)\u00b2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0\n\nFor x = 3:\n\n(3)\u00b2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0\n\nBoth values satisfy the equation, so I'm confident in my solutions.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the quadratic formula, but since the problem specifically asks to solve by factoring, I stuck with that method.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that the graph of this quadratic equation would be a parabola crossing the x-axis at x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nOverall, factoring quadratics requires a bit of practice to get comfortable with, but once you get the hang of it, it's a straightforward process.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x = 2 \\text{ and } x = 3} \\]"
