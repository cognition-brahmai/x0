        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Let's create a simple Go program that takes two numbers as input from the user, performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them, and then prints out the results.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) if you don't have it already.\n\nNow, let's write the code step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Set up your Go environment\n\nCreate a new directory for your project, for example, `math_operations`. Navigate into this directory in your terminal.\n\n### Step 2: Create a new Go file\n\nCreate a new file called `main.go` in your project directory.\n\n### Step 3: Write the code\n\nOpen `main.go` in your favorite text editor and write the following code:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Prompt the user for the first number\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter the first number: \")\n\tvar num1Str string\n\tfmt.Scanln(&num1Str)\n\n\t// Convert the input string to a float64\n\tnum1, err := strconv.ParseFloat(num1Str, 64)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Invalid input for the first number.\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Prompt the user for the second number\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter the second number: \")\n\tvar num2Str string\n\tfmt.Scanln(&num2Str)\n\n\t// Convert the input string to a float64\n\tnum2, err := strconv.ParseFloat(num2Str, 64)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Invalid input for the second number.\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Perform operations\n\tsum := num1 + num2\n\tdifference := num1 - num2\n\tproduct := num1 * num2\n\tvar quotient float64\n\tif num2 != 0 {\n\t\tquotient = num1 / num2\n\t} else {\n\t\tquotient = 0\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n\t}\n\n\t// Display the results\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Sum: %.2f\\n\", sum)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Difference: %.2f\\n\", difference)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Product: %.2f\\n\", product)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Quotient: %.2f\\n\", quotient)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import necessary packages:**\n   - `fmt` for input and output operations.\n   - `strconv` for converting strings to floats.\n\n2. **Read user inputs:**\n   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers and read them as strings.\n\n3. **Convert strings to floats:**\n   - Use `strconv.ParseFloat` to convert the input strings to `float64`. If there's an error in conversion, print an error message and exit.\n\n4. **Perform operations:**\n   - Addition (`sum`).\n   - Subtraction (`difference`).\n   - Multiplication (`product`).\n   - Division (`quotient`), with a check to avoid division by zero.\n\n5. **Display results:**\n   - Use `fmt.Printf` to print the results with two decimal places.\n\n### Step 4: Run the program\n\nOpen your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command:\n\n```sh\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nThe program will prompt you to enter two numbers. After you enter them, it will display the sum, difference, product, and quotient.\n\n### Example Output:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 5\nSum: 15.00\nDifference: 5.00\nProduct: 50.00\nQuotient: 2.00\n```\n\nOr, if you try to divide by zero:\n\n```\nEnter the first number: 10\nEnter the second number: 0\nCannot divide by zero.\nSum: 10.00\nDifference: 10.00\nProduct: 0.00\nQuotient: 0.00\n```\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple Go program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
