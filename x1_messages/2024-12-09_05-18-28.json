        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. It says the garden has a length of 25 meters and a width of 15 meters, and I need to find out what the area is in square meters. Alright, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width. That's a basic formula I learned in geometry.\n\nGiven that, the length is 25 meters and the width is 15 meters. So, I just need to multiply 25 by 15 to get the area.\n\nLet me do the math here. 25 multiplied by 15.\n\nWell, 25 times 10 is 250, and 25 times 5 is 125. So, adding those together, 250 plus 125 equals 375.\n\nTherefore, the area of the garden is 375 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe I can use the formula for the area again to double-check.\n\nLength is 25 meters, width is 15 meters, so 25 times 15 is indeed 375.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of units. 25 meters times 15 meters equals 375 meter squared, which is square meters.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using different units, but since the question is in meters and asks for square meters, there's no need to convert units.\n\nSo, I think 375 square meters is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]"
