        "content": "Let's see. There are 120 students in total, and each one reads either English or French or both. Some read only English, some only French, and some both languages. I need to find out how many read both.\n\nI know that 70 students read English and 80 read French. But if I add those together, 70 + 80 = 150, which is more than the total number of students. That means that some students are being counted twice because they read both languages.\n\nSo, to find out how many read both, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That principle says that to find the total number of students who read either English or French, I should add the number who read English to the number who read French and then subtract the number who read both, because those are counted in both groups.\n\nIn formula terms, it's:\n\nTotal = English + French - Both\n\nI know the total is 120, English is 70, and French is 80. So plugging in the numbers:\n\n120 = 70 + 80 - Both\n\nNow, solving for \"Both\":\n\nBoth = 70 + 80 - 120\nBoth = 150 - 120\nBoth = 30\n\nSo, 30 students read both English and French.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If 30 students read both, then the number who read only English would be 70 - 30 = 40, and only French would be 80 - 30 = 50. Adding those up: 40 (only English) + 50 (only French) + 30 (both) = 120, which matches the total number of students. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the overlap between the two groups. Since 70 read English and 80 read French, and there are only 120 students, the overlap must be 70 + 80 - 120 = 30.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I let:\n\n- E be the set of students who read English.\n\n- F be the set of students who read French.\n\nThen, the number of students who read English or French or both is the union of sets E and F, which is denoted by E \u222a F.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\nn(E \u222a F) = n(E) + n(F) - n(E \u2229 F)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n(E \u222a F) is the total number of students who read English or French or both.\n\n- n(E) is the number who read English.\n\n- n(F) is the number who read French.\n\n- n(E \u2229 F) is the number who read both.\n\nWe know that every student reads either English or French or both, so n(E \u222a F) = total number of students = 120.\n\nGiven n(E) = 70 and n(F) = 80.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n120 = 70 + 80 - n(E \u2229 F)\n\nSo, n(E \u2229 F) = 70 + 80 - 120 = 30.\n\nAgain, 30 students read both languages.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that if there are 70 who read English and 80 who read French, and only 120 students in total, then the number reading both must be the sum of those reading English and those reading French minus the total number of students, which is again 70 + 80 - 120 = 30.\n\nI think no matter which way I look at it, the answer comes out to be 30.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents students who read English, and the other represents students who read French.\n\n- The part where the circles overlap represents students who read both languages.\n\n- The part of the English circle that doesn't overlap represents students who read only English.\n\n- The part of the French circle that doesn't overlap represents students who read only French.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n- Total students = 120\n\n- Students who read English (E) = 70\n\n- Students who read French (F) = 80\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Only English = E - both\n\n- Only French = F - both\n\n- Both = E \u2229 F\n\nThen, the total is:\n\nOnly English + Only French + Both = 120\n\nSubstituting:\n\n(70 - both) + (80 - both) + both = 120\n\nSimplify:\n\n70 - both + 80 - both + both = 120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n150 - both = 120\n\nSo, both = 150 - 120 = 30\n\nAgain, 30 students read both languages.\n\nI can't think of any other way to interpret this problem. It seems straightforward. The answer should be 30 students.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that some students don't read either language. However, the problem states that every student reads either English or French or both, so there are no students who don't read either language.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains 30.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough. The answer is 30 students read both English and French.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
