        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. There's a basket with 10 apples and 20 oranges, so in total, there are 30 fruits. The question is, if I pick one fruit at random, what's the probability that it's an apple, and then, after putting it back, I pick an orange.\n\nAlright, first things first, since I'm putting the fruit back after the first pick, that means the total number of fruits remains the same for both picks. So, each pick is independent of the other.\n\nNow, to find the probability of both events happening in sequence, I need to find the probability of picking an apple first and then multiplying it by the probability of picking an orange second, since they're independent events.\n\nLet me start by finding the probability of picking an apple first. There are 10 apples out of 30 fruits, so the probability is 10/30, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNext, the probability of picking an orange second. Since I'm putting the first fruit back, the total number of fruits is still 30, and there are 20 oranges. So, the probability is 20/30, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nNow, to find the combined probability of both events happening in sequence, I multiply the two probabilities together: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.\n\nSo, the probability of picking an apple first and then an orange is 2/9.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The problem says \"pick an apple, and then after putting it back, pick an orange.\" Yes, that's correct. The events are independent because of the replacement.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of combinations. The total number of ways to pick one fruit and then another with replacement is 30 * 30, since there are 30 choices each time.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes would be the number of ways to pick an apple first and an orange second. There are 10 apples and 20 oranges, so 10 * 20 = 200 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 200 / (30 * 30) = 200 / 900 = 2/9.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider the general formula for independent events. If event A and event B are independent, then the probability of both A and B occurring is P(A) * P(B).\n\nIn this case, picking an apple is event A with P(A) = 10/30 = 1/3, and picking an orange is event B with P(B) = 20/30 = 2/3. Therefore, P(A and B) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. The probability is 2/9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}} \\]"
