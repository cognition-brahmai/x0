        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing football and basketball. There are 30 students in total. 18 play football, 17 play basketball, and 10 play both games. I need to find out how many students don't play either game. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the two games. Then, I can subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play either game.\n\nSo, 18 play football and 17 play basketball. If I just add those two numbers together, I get 18 + 17 = 35. But wait, that's more than the total number of students, which is 30. That can't be right. Oh, right, because some students play both games. So, if they're counted in both the football and basketball groups, I've double-counted them.\n\nOkay, so I need to account for those students who play both games. There are 10 students who play both. So, to get the total number of students who play at least one game, I should add the number of football players and basketball players and then subtract the number of students who play both, to correct for the double-counting.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nTotal playing at least one game = (football players) + (basketball players) - (both games players)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal playing at least one game = 18 + 17 - 10 = 25\n\nSo, 25 students play either football or basketball or both.\n\nNow, to find out how many students don't play either game, I subtract the number of students who play at least one game from the total number of students.\n\nStudents not playing either game = total students - total playing at least one game\n\nStudents not playing either game = 30 - 25 = 5\n\nTherefore, 5 students don't play either football or basketball.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I might be missing something. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer?\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use sets. Let's denote:\n\n- Total students = 30\n\n- Football players (F) = 18\n\n- Basketball players (B) = 17\n\n- Both games players (F \u2229 B) = 10\n\nWe want to find the number of students who don't play either game, which is the number of students who are neither in set F nor in set B.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of students who play either football or basketball is:\n\nF \u222a B = F + B - F \u2229 B\n\nWhich is 18 + 17 - 10 = 25, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the number of students who don't play either game is the total number of students minus those who play at least one game:\n\nTotal - (F \u222a B) = 30 - 25 = 5\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of Venn diagrams. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents football players, and the other represents basketball players. The overlapping area represents students who play both games.\n\nSo, the football circle has 18 students, but within that, 10 play both. Therefore, the number of students who play only football is 18 - 10 = 8.\n\nSimilarly, the basketball circle has 17 students, with 10 who play both. So, the number who play only basketball is 17 - 10 = 7.\n\nThen, the overlapping area has 10 students who play both.\n\nTo find the total number of students who play at least one game, I add those who play only football, only basketball, and both:\n\nOnly football: 8\n\nOnly basketball: 7\n\nBoth: 10\n\nTotal playing at least one game: 8 + 7 + 10 = 25\n\nAgain, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, subtracting from the total number of students: 30 - 25 = 5 students who don't play either game.\n\nI think this is solid. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the data.\n\nSuppose I try to use the concept of complements. The complement of playing at least one game is not playing any game.\n\nSo, the number of students not playing any game is the complement of F \u222a B, which is:\n\nTotal - (F \u222a B) = 30 - 25 = 5\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use probabilities, but since this is about counts of students, it's more straightforward to stick with set theory and counts.\n\nI can also check if there's any student counted more than once. Since I've subtracted the overlap, I don't think so.\n\nAnother way to look at it: the number of students who play only football is 18 - 10 = 8, only basketball is 17 - 10 = 7, and both is 10. So, total students accounted for in sports are 8 + 7 + 10 = 25. Again, 30 - 25 = 5.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways. The answer should be 5 students who don't play either game.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can look for potential mistakes. Did I assume that all students are either in football, basketball, or both? No, the problem states there are students who don't play either game, so my approach accounts for that.\n\nAnother potential mistake could be in the inclusion-exclusion principle, but I double-checked that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me confirm: 18 play football, 17 play basketball, 10 play both. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident with the answer being 5 students who don't play either game.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
