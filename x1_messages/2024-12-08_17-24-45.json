        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about two trains leaving different stations at different times and traveling towards each other. I need to find out when they pass each other. Okay, so let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Station A and Station B are 300 miles apart. Train A leaves Station A at 9 AM going towards Station B at 60 mph. Train B leaves Station B at 10 AM going towards Station A at 80 mph. I need to find out when these two trains pass each other.\n\nHmm, since Train B leaves an hour later, I need to account for that in my calculations. Let's think about the time variable. Let's define t as the time in hours after 10 AM when the two trains pass each other.\n\nSo, from 9 AM to 10 AM, Train A has been traveling for 1 hour before Train B starts. In that 1 hour, Train A would have covered 60 miles (since it's going at 60 mph). So, at 10 AM, when Train B starts, the remaining distance between the two trains is 300 miles minus the 60 miles that Train A has already covered, which is 240 miles.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds add up. Train A is going at 60 mph and Train B at 80 mph, so their relative speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nOkay, so now I have that at 10 AM, the distance between them is 240 miles, and they are approaching each other at 140 mph. I need to find out how long it takes for them to cover these 240 miles at that relative speed.\n\nTime = distance / speed, so t = 240 miles / 140 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that: 240 divided by 140 is 1.714 hours. Hmm, that's approximately 1 hour and 42.4 minutes.\n\nWait, let me be more precise. 240 / 140 = 1.7142857 hours. To convert the decimal part to minutes, I multiply 0.7142857 by 60 minutes, which is approximately 42.857 minutes. So, roughly 1 hour and 43 minutes after 10 AM.\n\nTherefore, if they pass each other at approximately 11:43 AM.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the head start of Train A: 1 hour at 60 mph means it covers 60 miles by 10 AM.\n\nSo, remaining distance at 10 AM is 300 - 60 = 240 miles.\n\nCombined speed is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\nTime to cover 240 miles at 140 mph is indeed 240/140 = 1.7142857 hours.\n\nConverting 0.7142857 hours to minutes: 0.7142857 * 60 \u2248 42.857 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 1 hour and 43 minutes after 10 AM would be 11:43 AM.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11:43 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
