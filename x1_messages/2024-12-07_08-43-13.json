        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two types of candies: type X costs $2 each, and type Y costs $3 each. The customer buys a total of 20 candies and spends $50. We need to find out how many of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's let:\n\n- \\( x \\) = the number of type X candies\n\n- \\( y \\) = the number of type Y candies\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total number of candies is 20.\n\n2. The total cost is $50.\n\nSo, we can write two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\) (since the total number of candies is 20)\n\n2. \\( 2x + 3y = 50 \\) (since type X costs $2 each and type Y costs $3 each, and the total spent is $50)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I think substitution might be straightforward here.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - y \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 2(20 - y) + 3y = 50 \\)\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\( 40 - 2y + 3y = 50 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 40 + y = 50 \\)\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nNow that we have \\( y \\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 20 - 10 = 10 \\)\n\nSo, the customer bought 10 candies of type X and 10 candies of type Y.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they bought 10 type X candies at $2 each, that's \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\) dollars. For type Y, 10 candies at $3 each is \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\) dollars. Adding those up: \\( 20 + 30 = 50 \\) dollars, which matches the total spent. Also, \\( 10 + 10 = 20 \\) candies, which matches the total number of candies. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. For example, we could use elimination. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the same two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 20 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2x + 3y = 50 \\)\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 2:\n\n\\( 2x + 2y = 40 \\)\n\nNow, subtract this from the second equation:\n\n\\( (2x + 3y) - (2x + 2y) = 50 - 40 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( y = 10 \\)\n\nAgain, we get \\( y = 10 \\), and then \\( x = 20 - 10 = 10 \\). Same result.\n\nIs there any other method we could use? Maybe using matrices, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to think about the average cost per candy. The total spent is $50 for 20 candies, so the average cost per candy is \\( 50 / 20 = 2.5 \\) dollars. Since type X is $2 and type Y is $3, the average being $2.5 suggests an equal mix of both, which aligns with our earlier result of 10 each.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other possible solutions. Suppose they bought fewer than 10 type Y candies. Let's say \\( y = 9 \\), then \\( x = 11 \\). The cost would be \\( 2 \\times 11 + 3 \\times 9 = 22 + 27 = 49 \\), which is less than $50. Not enough. If \\( y = 11 \\), then \\( x = 9 \\), and the cost is \\( 2 \\times 9 + 3 \\times 11 = 18 + 33 = 51 \\), which is over $50. So, only \\( y = 10 \\) and \\( x = 10 \\) hits exactly $50.\n\nIs there a way to think about this problem without algebra? Maybe using trial and error, but that could take longer, especially with larger numbers.\n\nAnother approach: think about the difference in cost. Each type Y candy costs $1 more than type X. If all 20 were type X, the total cost would be \\( 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\) dollars. But they spent $50, which is $10 more. Since each type Y candy adds an extra dollar, they must have bought 10 type Y candies to make up the $10 difference. Therefore, \\( y = 10 \\) and \\( x = 10 \\). Same answer again.\n\nThis reinforces that our solution is correct. It's good to see multiple methods leading to the same conclusion.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the customer bought 10 candies of type X and 10 candies of type Y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ candies of type X and } 10 \\text{ candies of type Y}} \\]"
