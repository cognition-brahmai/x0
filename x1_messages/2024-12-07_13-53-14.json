        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 8 black balls and 7 white balls, making a total of 15 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick three balls at random without replacement, all three are black. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is picking three black balls, and the total possible outcomes are all the ways I can pick any three balls from the box.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick three balls out of 15 is a combination problem, because the order in which I pick the balls doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nHere, n = 15 and k = 3. So, the total number of ways to pick three balls from 15 is C(15, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3!(15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12!) / (3! \u00d7 12!)) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (2730) / 6 = 455.\n\nSo, there are 455 possible ways to pick any three balls from the box.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to pick three black balls. There are 8 black balls, so the number of ways to choose three black balls is C(8, 3).\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8 - 3)!) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (3! \u00d7 5!)) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (336) / 6 = 56.\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to pick three black balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all three balls picked are black is the number of favorable outcomes (picking three black balls) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (picking any three balls).\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 56 / 455.\n\nNow, I should simplify this fraction. Let's see if 56 and 455 have any common factors.\n\n56 divided by 7 is 8, and 455 divided by 7 is 65. So, 56/455 simplifies to 8/65.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 8/65.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can also calculate this using probabilities of picking each ball one by one, without replacement.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a black ball on the first draw is 8/15, since there are 8 black balls out of 15 total balls.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was black, there are now 7 black balls left and a total of 14 balls left in the box. So, the probability of picking a second black ball is 7/14 = 1/2.\n\nFinally, given that the first two balls were black, there are now 6 black balls left and a total of 13 balls left. So, the probability of picking a third black ball is 6/13.\n\nTo find the overall probability of all three events happening in sequence (picking three black balls in a row without replacement), I need to multiply these probabilities together:\n\nProbability = (8/15) \u00d7 (7/14) \u00d7 (6/13).\n\nLet me calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, (8/15) \u00d7 (7/14) = (8 \u00d7 7) / (15 \u00d7 14) = 56 / 210.\n\nSimplify 56/210 by dividing numerator and denominator by 14: 56 \u00f7 14 = 4, and 210 \u00f7 14 = 15. So, 4/15.\n\nNow, multiply that by 6/13: (4/15) \u00d7 (6/13) = (4 \u00d7 6) / (15 \u00d7 13) = 24 / 195.\n\nSimplify 24/195 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 24 \u00f7 3 = 8, and 195 \u00f7 3 = 65. So, 8/65.\n\nAlright, that matches my earlier result. So, the probability is indeed 8/65.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using permutations instead of combinations. But since the order doesn't matter here, combinations are the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of ways to pick three black balls out of eight and divide by the total number of ways to pick any three balls out of fifteen, which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nAnother way is to use the concept of conditional probability, which is what I did when I calculated the probability step by step for each ball picked.\n\nBoth methods gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that 8/65 is correct.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe checking if the problem meant with replacement or without replacement. But the problem specifically says \"without replacement,\" so that's correct.\n\nAlso, ensuring that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me quickly recalculate C(8, 3) and C(15, 3) to make sure.\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 336 / 6 = 56. That's correct.\n\nC(15, 3) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 2730 / 6 = 455. Correct.\n\nThen, 56 / 455 = 8/65 after simplifying. Yes, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, the step-by-step multiplication: (8/15) \u00d7 (7/14) \u00d7 (6/13) = (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) = 336 / 2730 = 56 / 455 = 8/65. Same result.\n\nSo, I think I've covered all the bases here. The probability is 8/65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{65}} \\]"
