        "content": "So I have this problem here: I need to evaluate the line integral \u222eC (x^2 dx + y^2 dy), where C is the circle centered at the origin with radius 2. And I'm supposed to use Green's theorem to do this. Okay, let's recall what Green's theorem is. It's a theorem that relates a line integral around a simple closed curve C to a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C. The standard form of Green's theorem is:\n\n\u222eC (P dx + Q dy) = \u222cD (\u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y) dA\n\nSo, in this case, P = x^2 and Q = y^2. I need to compute the partial derivatives \u2202Q/\u2202x and \u2202P/\u2202y.\n\nLet's compute \u2202Q/\u2202x:\n\nQ = y^2, so \u2202Q/\u2202x = 0, because y^2 is independent of x.\n\nNow, \u2202P/\u2202y:\n\nP = x^2, so \u2202P/\u2202y = 0, because x^2 is independent of y.\n\nTherefore, the integrand for the double integral becomes:\n\n\u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nSo, \u222cD (0) dA = 0\n\nDoes that mean the line integral is zero? Wait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me double-check Green's theorem. Yes, it states that \u222eC (P dx + Q dy) = \u222cD (\u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y) dA, assuming that P and Q have continuous partial derivatives on an open region containing D.\n\nIn this case, P = x^2 and Q = y^2, which are both polynomials and have continuous partial derivatives everywhere. The region D is the disk of radius 2 centered at the origin.\n\nSo, according to Green's theorem, the line integral should indeed be zero.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should verify this by computing the line integral directly.\n\nLet's parametrize the circle C. Since it's a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, I can use the parametrization:\n\nx = 2 cos t\n\ny = 2 sin t\n\nWhere t goes from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nThen, dx/dt = -2 sin t\n\nAnd dy/dt = 2 cos t\n\nSo, the line integral becomes:\n\n\u222eC (x^2 dx + y^2 dy) = \u222b_0^{2\u03c0} [(2 cos t)^2 (-2 sin t) + (2 sin t)^2 (2 cos t)] dt\n\nLet's compute this integral step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (2 cos t)^2:\n\n(2 cos t)^2 = 4 cos^2 t\n\nThen, (2 cos t)^2 dx = 4 cos^2 t * (-2 sin t) dt = -8 cos^2 t sin t dt\n\nSimilarly, (2 sin t)^2 = 4 sin^2 t\n\nAnd (2 sin t)^2 dy = 4 sin^2 t * 2 cos t dt = 8 sin^2 t cos t dt\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b_0^{2\u03c0} (-8 cos^2 t sin t + 8 sin^2 t cos t) dt\n\nFactor out the 8:\n\n8 \u222b_0^{2\u03c0} (-cos^2 t sin t + sin^2 t cos t) dt\n\nHmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify the integrand.\n\nLet's look at -cos^2 t sin t + sin^2 t cos t.\n\nI can factor out cos t sin t:\n\ncos t sin t (-cos t + sin t)\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe I should split the integral into two parts:\n\n8 [\u222b_0^{2\u03c0} -cos^2 t sin t dt + \u222b_0^{2\u03c0} sin^2 t cos t dt]\n\nLet's compute each integral separately.\n\nFirst, \u222b_0^{2\u03c0} -cos^2 t sin t dt.\n\nLet u = cos t, then du = -sin t dt\n\nWhen t = 0, u = 1\n\nWhen t = 2\u03c0, u = 1\n\nSo, \u222b -cos^2 t sin t dt = \u222b u^2 du from u=1 to u=1 = 0\n\nSimilarly, \u222b_0^{2\u03c0} sin^2 t cos t dt.\n\nLet v = sin t, then dv = cos t dt\n\nWhen t = 0, v = 0\n\nWhen t = 2\u03c0, v = 0\n\nSo, \u222b sin^2 t cos t dt = \u222b v^2 dv from v=0 to v=0 = 0\n\nTherefore, the entire integral is 8*(0 + 0) = 0\n\nSo, indeed, the line integral is zero, which matches the result I got using Green's theorem.\n\nWait a second, is there a different way to see this? Maybe using properties of conservative fields or something.\n\nLet's consider the vector field F = (P, Q) = (x^2, y^2)\n\nIs this field conservative? Well, for a field to be conservative, its curl should be zero, which in two dimensions means \u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y = 0\n\nWhich is exactly what we have: \u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nSo, the field is conservative, and therefore the line integral around any closed curve should be zero, which is consistent with our previous results.\n\nAlternatively, since the domain is simply connected (the disk), and the field is conservative, the line integral is path-independent, and around a closed path, it should be zero.\n\nSo, all these approaches lead to the same conclusion: the line integral is zero.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should consider the orientation of the curve. The problem says C is the circle centered at the origin with radius 2. By convention, circles are traversed counterclockwise, which is the positive orientation in Green's theorem.\n\nBut since our computations already agree, orientation shouldn't change the result in this case.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the conditions for Green's theorem are satisfied. The vector field F = (x^2, y^2) is continuously differentiable everywhere, including on and inside the circle C. So, no issues there.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the line integral is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
