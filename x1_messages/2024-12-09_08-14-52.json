        "content": "So there are 5 boys and 7 girls in a classroom, and each student shakes hands with every other student exactly once. I need to find out how many handshakes occur in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of students in the classroom. That would be the sum of boys and girls, so 5 boys plus 7 girls equals 12 students in total.\n\nNow, each of these 12 students shakes hands with every other student exactly once. So, student A shakes hands with student B, but then student B doesn't need to shake hands with student A again because that would be the same handshake.\n\nThis sounds like a combination problem, where I need to find the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 12 to shake hands. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 12 \\) (total students), and \\( k = 2 \\) because handshakes happen between 2 students.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!}\n\\]\n\nI know that 12! is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!, so the 10! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2! \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2!}\n\\]\n\nAnd 2! is 2 \u00d7 1, which is 2:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 handshakes in total.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe by considering the number of handshakes each student makes.\n\nEach of the 12 students shakes hands with 11 other students (since they don't shake their own hand). So, that would be 12 students times 11 handshakes each, which is 132 handshakes.\n\nBut, in this approach, each handshake is counted twice\u2014once for each participant. So, to get the actual number of unique handshakes, I need to divide by 2.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total handshakes} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nThis matches the previous result from the combination formula.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe by considering boys and girls separately.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Number of handshakes among boys:\n\nThere are 5 boys, so the number of handshakes among them is C(5, 2).\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\n- Number of handshakes among girls:\n\nThere are 7 girls, so C(7, 2).\n\n\\[\nC(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7 - 2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\n\\]\n\n- Number of handshakes between boys and girls:\n\nEach boy shakes hands with each girl once. So, it's 5 boys times 7 girls, which is 35 handshakes.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n\\[\n10 (\\text{boy-boy}) + 21 (\\text{girl-girl}) + 35 (\\text{boy-girl}) = 66\n\\]\n\nAgain, the total is 66 handshakes.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result. So, the final answer is 66 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]"
