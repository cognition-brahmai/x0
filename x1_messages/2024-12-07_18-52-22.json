        "content": "To determine the volume of a cylinder, I know that there's a specific formula for that. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V equals pi times the radius squared times the height. So, V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nGiven that the radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm, I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nFirst, I need to square the radius. The radius is 5 cm, so 5 squared is 5 times 5, which is 25. So, r\u00b2 = 25 cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, I multiply this by pi. Pi is approximately 3.14159. So, \u03c0 times 25 is 3.14159 times 25.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3.14159 times 25 is approximately 78.53975 cm\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to multiply this area by the height of the cylinder to get the volume. The height is 10 cm.\n\nSo, volume V = 78.53975 cm\u00b2 times 10 cm = 785.3975 cm\u00b3.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 785.40 cm\u00b3.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express it in terms of pi, I can leave it as V = \u03c0 times 25 times 10 = 250\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nBut since pi is approximately 3.14159, the numerical value is what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the volume of the cylinder is about 785.40 cubic centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{785.40 \\text{ cm}^3} \\]"
