        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got 100 students in a class, and each student has either a cat or a dog as a pet. The ratio given is that for every 3 students with a cat, there are 2 students with a dog. We need to find out how many students have cats and how many have dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the ratio means. The ratio 3:2 for cats to dogs means that for every group of 3 cat owners, there are 2 dog owners. So, if we think in terms of groups, each group consists of 3 cat owners and 2 dog owners, making a total of 5 students per group.\n\nNow, since there are 100 students in total, I can find out how many such groups there are by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per group. So, 100 divided by 5 equals 20. That means there are 20 groups of students.\n\nNext, since each group has 3 cat owners, to find the total number of cat owners, I can multiply the number of groups by 3. So, 20 groups times 3 cat owners per group equals 60 cat owners.\n\nSimilarly, each group has 2 dog owners, so the total number of dog owners would be 20 groups times 2 dog owners per group, which equals 40 dog owners.\n\nTo double-check, I can add the number of cat owners and dog owners together: 60 + 40 equals 100, which matches the total number of students. Also, the ratio of cat owners to dog owners is 60:40, which simplifies to 3:2, matching the given ratio.\n\nSo, the answer is that 60 students have cats and 40 students have dogs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\text{ students have cats and } 40 \\text{ students have dogs.}} \\]"
