        "content": "Let's see. Alice has 12 apples, Bob has 8 apples, and Carol has 16 apples. They want to redistribute these apples equally among themselves. So, first, I need to find out the total number of apples they have altogether.\n\nAlice's apples: 12\nBob's apples: 8\nCarol's apples: 16\n\nTotal apples = 12 + 8 + 16\n\nLet me add those up: 12 plus 8 is 20, and 20 plus 16 is 36. So, there are 36 apples in total.\n\nNow, they want to redistribute these apples equally among the three of them. So, I need to divide the total number of apples by 3.\n\n36 apples \u00f7 3 people = 12 apples per person\n\nSo, after redistributing the apples equally, each person should have 12 apples.\n\nTherefore, Carol would have 12 apples after the redistribution.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlice starts with 12, Bob with 8, Carol with 16. Total is 36. Divided by 3 is 12 each.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many apples each person needs to give or receive to reach the equal share.\n\nStarting amounts:\n- Alice: 12\n- Bob: 8\n- Carol: 16\n\nTarget: 12 each\n\nSo, Alice already has 12, so she doesn't need to give or receive any apples.\n\nBob has 8, which is 4 less than 12, so he needs to receive 4 apples.\n\nCarol has 16, which is 4 more than 12, so she needs to give away 4 apples.\n\nSo, Carol gives 4 apples to Bob.\n\nAfter that:\n\n- Alice: 12\n- Bob: 8 + 4 = 12\n- Carol: 16 - 4 = 12\n\nYes, everyone has 12 apples.\n\nTherefore, Carol has 12 apples after the redistribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
