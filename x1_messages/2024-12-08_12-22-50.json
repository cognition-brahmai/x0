        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a TypeScript program that connects to a MySQL database, creates a table named \"products\" with columns for id, name, and price, and inserts some sample data into it. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js installed, you can set up a new project.\n\n1. **Create a new directory for your project:**\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir my-ts-mysql-app\n   cd my-ts-mysql-app\n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize a new Node.js project:**\n\n   ```bash\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n3. **Install necessary dependencies:**\n\n   You'll need TypeScript, the MySQL driver for Node.js, and TypeScript's type definitions for Node.js.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install typescript @types/node mysql\n   ```\n\n4. **Set up TypeScript:**\n\n   Initialize TypeScript in your project.\n\n   ```bash\n   npx tsc --init\n   ```\n\n   This will create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project directory. You can keep the default settings for now.\n\n5. **Create your TypeScript file:**\n\n   Create a new file called `app.ts`.\n\n   ```bash\n   touch app.ts\n   ```\n\n6. **Write the TypeScript code:**\n\n   Open `app.ts` in your favorite text editor and add the following code:\n\n   ```typescript\n   import * as mysql from 'mysql';\n\n   // Create a connection to the database\n   const connection = mysql.createConnection({\n     host: 'localhost',\n     user: 'your_mysql_username',\n     password: 'your_mysql_password',\n     database: 'your_database_name'\n   });\n\n   connection.connect((err) => {\n     if (err) {\n       console.error('Error connecting to MySQL:', err);\n       return;\n     }\n     console.log('Connected to MySQL database');\n\n     // Create the products table\n     const createTableQuery = `\n       CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (\n         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n         price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL\n       )\n     `;\n\n     connection.query(createTableQuery, (err, result) => {\n       if (err) {\n         console.error('Error creating table:', err);\n         return;\n       }\n       console.log('Table created');\n\n       // Insert sample data\n       const sampleProducts = [\n         { name: 'Product 1', price: 19.99 },\n         { name: 'Product 2', price: 29.99 },\n         { name: 'Product 3', price: 39.99 }\n       ];\n\n       const insertQuery = 'INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ?';\n       const values = sampleProducts.map(product => [product.name, product.price]);\n\n       connection.query(insertQuery, [values], (err, result) => {\n         if (err) {\n           console.error('Error inserting data:', err);\n           return;\n         }\n         console.log('Data inserted');\n         connection.end();\n       });\n     });\n   });\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to replace `'your_mysql_username'`, `'your_mysql_password'`, and `'your_database_name'` with your actual MySQL credentials and database name.\n\n7. **Compile and run the TypeScript code:**\n\n   First, compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:\n\n   ```bash\n   npx tsc\n   ```\n\n   This will generate a `app.js` file in the same directory. Then, run the JavaScript file:\n\n   ```bash\n   node app.js\n   ```\n\n   You should see output indicating that the connection was successful, the table was created (if it didn't exist), and the sample data was inserted.\n\nThat's it! You've written a TypeScript program that connects to a MySQL database, creates a table, and inserts sample data. If you have any issues or questions, feel free to ask.\n\n**Note:** For production applications, consider using connection pooling and handling errors more gracefully. Also, ensure that your database credentials are stored securely, preferably using environment variables."
