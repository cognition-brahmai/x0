        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a school with 600 students and a student-teacher ratio of 30:1. That means for every 30 students, there's one teacher. The school wants to reduce this ratio to 25:1 without decreasing the number of students. We need to find out how many extra teachers they should hire to achieve this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many teachers are currently employed at the school. Given the student-teacher ratio is 30:1, I can calculate the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 30.\n\nNumber of current teachers = Total students / Student-teacher ratio\n\nSo,\n\nNumber of current teachers = 600 / 30 = 20 teachers\n\nNow, the school wants to reduce the student-teacher ratio to 25:1. That means for every 25 students, there should be one teacher. To find out how many teachers are needed for this new ratio, I'll again divide the total number of students by the new ratio.\n\nNumber of teachers needed = Total students / New student-teacher ratio\n\nNumber of teachers needed = 600 / 25\n\nWait, 600 divided by 25. Let me do this calculation carefully.\n\n600 \u00f7 25\n\nWell, 25 times 24 is 600, so 600 \u00f7 25 = 24 teachers\n\nSo, they need 24 teachers to have a ratio of 25:1.\n\nCurrently, there are 20 teachers, so the number of extra teachers needed would be:\n\nExtra teachers needed = Number of teachers needed - Number of current teachers\n\nExtra teachers needed = 24 - 20 = 4 teachers\n\nSo, at first glance, it seems like they need to hire 4 additional teachers.\n\nBut let me double-check this to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of proportions. The current student-teacher ratio is 30:1, and they want to reduce it to 25:1. That means they want more teachers per student.\n\nLet me see how the number of teachers relates to the ratio.\n\nIf the ratio is 30:1, that means for every 30 students, there's 1 teacher.\n\nSimilarly, 25:1 means for every 25 students, there's 1 teacher.\n\nSo, the number of teachers is inversely proportional to the ratio.\n\nWait, actually, as the ratio decreases, the number of teachers increases for the same number of students.\n\nWait, no, the ratio is students per teacher. So, a lower ratio means more teachers.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the current situation:\n\n600 students, 20 teachers (since 600 / 30 = 20)\n\nDesired ratio: 25:1\n\nSo, number of teachers needed = 600 / 25 = 24 teachers\n\nTherefore, extra teachers needed = 24 - 20 = 4 teachers\n\nThis seems consistent with my first calculation.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if the number of students changes.\n\nWait, no, the problem says without reducing the number of students, so students remain at 600.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see how many teachers are required per student in each ratio.\n\nIn the current ratio, per teacher has 30 students.\n\nIn the new ratio, each teacher would have 25 students.\n\nSo, the number of teachers needed would be 600 / 25 = 24 teachers.\n\nAgain, that suggests needing 4 extra teachers.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem?\n\nLet\u2019s think in terms of proportionality.\n\nIf the student-teacher ratio is reduced from 30:1 to 25:1, that\u2019s a reduction in the ratio by a factor of 30/25 = 1.2.\n\nWait, no. If the ratio is reduced, it means the number of students per teacher is decreased.\n\nActually, the student-teacher ratio is inversely proportional to the number of teachers.\n\nSo, if the ratio is reduced by a factor of 30/25 = 1.2, the number of teachers needed increases by the same factor.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nCurrent ratio: 30:1\n\nDesired ratio: 25:1\n\nThe ratio is being reduced from 30 to 25, which is a reduction by a factor of 30/25 = 1.2.\n\nSo, to maintain the same number of students, the number of teachers needs to increase by this factor.\n\nTherefore, new number of teachers = current number of teachers * (30/25)\n\nBut earlier, I calculated current teachers as 20, so:\n\nNew number of teachers = 20 * (30/25) = 20 * (6/5) = 24 teachers\n\nAgain, this matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, extra teachers needed = 24 - 20 = 4 teachers\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nBut perhaps I can look at it in terms of the change in ratio.\n\nThe change in ratio is from 30:1 to 25:1, which is a decrease of 5 in the ratio.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that directly helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the number of students per teacher decreasing from 30 to 25, which means each teacher is handling fewer students, so more teachers are needed to handle the same number of students.\n\nSo, the increase in the number of teachers is proportional to the decrease in the number of students per teacher.\n\nBut I think I've already established that with the calculations above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of proportionality constants.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet \\( r \\) be the student-teacher ratio.\n\nLet \\( t \\) be the number of teachers.\n\nLet \\( s \\) be the number of students.\n\nThen, \\( r = s / t \\)\n\nSo, \\( t = s / r \\)\n\nGiven \\( s = 600 \\)\n\nCurrent \\( r = 30 \\), so \\( t = 600 / 30 = 20 \\)\n\nDesired \\( r = 25 \\), so \\( t = 600 / 25 = 24 \\)\n\nTherefore, extra teachers needed = 24 - 20 = 4\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps I can consider the percentage increase in teachers needed.\n\nCurrent ratio: 30:1\n\nDesired ratio: 25:1\n\nRatio reduction factor: 25/30 = 5/6\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, to reduce the ratio from 30:1 to 25:1, it's like multiplying the ratio by 25/30 = 5/6.\n\nBut since the student-teacher ratio is inversely proportional to the number of teachers, the number of teachers needs to be increased by the factor of 30/25 = 6/5.\n\nSo, new number of teachers = old number of teachers * (6/5) = 20 * (6/5) = 24 teachers\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, considering percentage increase:\n\nThe ratio is being reduced from 30 to 25, which is a reduction of 5 units.\n\nWhat percentage reduction is that?\n\n(5 / 30) * 100% = 16.666...%\n\nSo, the ratio is being reduced by approximately 16.67%.\n\nSince the number of teachers is inversely proportional to the ratio, the percentage increase in teachers needed would be the reciprocal of the reduction factor.\n\nWait, or more precisely, since ratio is reduced by a factor of 5/6, teachers need to increase by a factor of 6/5.\n\nWhich is an increase of 6/5 - 1 = 1/5 = 0.2 or 20%.\n\nSo, if current teachers are 20, then 20% increase would be 4 teachers, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it:\n\nPercentage decrease in ratio = (old ratio - new ratio) / old ratio * 100%\n\n= (30 - 25)/30 * 100% = 5/30 * 100% = 16.666...%\n\nTherefore, the number of teachers needs to increase by 1 / (1 - 16.666...%) -1\n\nWait, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the ratio is decreased by a factor of 25/30 = 5/6, the number of teachers needs to increase by 6/5.\n\nWhich is the same as an increase of 20%.\n\nAgain, 20% of 20 teachers is 4 teachers.\n\nSo, all these different approaches are leading me to the same conclusion that the school needs to hire 4 additional teachers.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if the ratio includes both students and teachers.\n\nBut typically, student-teacher ratio is defined as students per teacher, which is how I've interpreted it.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes ratios can be expressed differently, but in education, it's standard to express it as students per teacher.\n\nAnother consideration: are there other staff members besides teachers that affect this ratio?\n\nBut the problem specifies student-teacher ratio, so I believe it's solely about teachers.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"without reducing the number of students,\" which confirms that only teachers are being added.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and the calculation seems consistent across different methods.\n\nTherefore, the school needs to hire 4 extra teachers to reduce the student-teacher ratio from 30:1 to 25:1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
