        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a company with 50 employees, and their average salary is $60,000 per year. Then, the company hires 10 new employees with an average salary of $45,000 per year. I need to find out what the new average salary will be for all the employees after hiring these new people.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what average salary means. Average salary is the total salary paid to all employees divided by the number of employees. So, for the original 50 employees, the total salary paid is 50 times $60,000.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n50 employees * $60,000/employee = $3,000,000\n\nSo, the total salary for the original 50 employees is $3,000,000.\n\nNow, the company hires 10 new employees with an average salary of $45,000 each. So, the total salary for these 10 new employees is:\n\n10 employees * $45,000/employee = $450,000\n\nNow, to find the new total salary for all employees, I need to add the original total salary and the new employees' total salary:\n\n$3,000,000 + $450,000 = $3,450,000\n\nNext, I need to find the total number of employees now. Originally, there were 50 employees, and they hired 10 more, so:\n\n50 + 10 = 60 employees\n\nNow, the new average salary will be the new total salary divided by the new total number of employees:\n\nNew average salary = Total salary / Total employees = $3,450,000 / 60\n\nLet me do that division:\n\n$3,450,000 \u00f7 60 = $57,500\n\nSo, the new average salary for all 60 employees is $57,500 per year.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? The original average was $60,000, and we're adding new employees who make less, so the average should go down, right? $57,500 is less than $60,000, so that seems logical.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nOriginal total salary: 50 * $60,000 = $3,000,000 \u2705\n\nNew employees' total salary: 10 * $45,000 = $450,000 \u2705\n\nTotal salary now: $3,000,000 + $450,000 = $3,450,000 \u2705\n\nTotal employees now: 50 + 10 = 60 \u2705\n\nNew average salary: $3,450,000 / 60 = $57,500 \u2705\n\nEverything checks out. So, the new average salary is $57,500 per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{57500} \\]"
