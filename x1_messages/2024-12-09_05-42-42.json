        "content": "So I have this problem: find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. Okay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what it's asking. So, I need to add up all the numbers that are less than 1000 and are either multiples of 3 or multiples of 5.\n\nAlright, so multiples of 3 are numbers like 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on, up to 999, since 999 is 3 times 333. Similarly, multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, up to 995, which is 5 times 199.\n\nBut wait, some numbers are multiples of both 3 and 5, like 15, 30, 45, etc. If I just add up all multiples of 3 and all multiples of 5 separately, I'll be double-counting those numbers that are multiples of both. So, I need to make sure I only count them once.\n\nI think this is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem. In set theory, if I have two sets, say set A with multiples of 3 and set B with multiples of 5, the union of A and B would be all multiples of 3 or 5. The formula for the union is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|, where \u2229 represents the intersection, or numbers that are in both sets.\n\nIn this case, since I'm dealing with sums, not counts, I need to sum the multiples of 3, sum the multiples of 5, and then subtract the sum of the multiples of both 3 and 5 (which is multiples of 15) to correct for double-counting.\n\nSo, sum = (sum of multiples of 3) + (sum of multiples of 5) - (sum of multiples of 15)\n\nThat makes sense. Now, how do I calculate the sum of multiples of a certain number below 1000?\n\nLet's take multiples of 3 first. The multiples of 3 below 1000 form an arithmetic series: 3, 6, 9, ..., 999.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n\nSum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n\nSo, for multiples of 3:\n\nFirst term (a) = 3\n\nCommon difference (d) = 3\n\nLast term (l) = 999\n\nNumber of terms (n) can be found by:\n\nn = (l - a)/d + 1 = (999 - 3)/3 + 1 = 996/3 + 1 = 332 + 1 = 333\n\nSo, sum of multiples of 3 = 333 * (3 + 999)/2 = 333 * 501 = ...\n\nHmm, let me calculate that.\n\n333 * 500 = 166,500\n\n333 * 1 = 333\n\nSo, 166,500 + 333 = 166,833\n\nOkay, so the sum of multiples of 3 is 166,833.\n\nNow, multiples of 5 below 1000: 5, 10, 15, ..., 995.\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\na = 5\n\nd = 5\n\nl = 995\n\nn = (995 - 5)/5 + 1 = 990/5 + 1 = 198 + 1 = 199\n\nSum = 199 * (5 + 995)/2 = 199 * 500 = 99,500\n\nSo, the sum of multiples of 5 is 99,500.\n\nNow, multiples of 15 below 1000: 15, 30, 45, ..., 990.\n\nAgain, using the formula:\n\na = 15\n\nd = 15\n\nl = 990\n\nn = (990 - 15)/15 + 1 = 975/15 + 1 = 65 + 1 = 66\n\nSum = 66 * (15 + 990)/2 = 66 * 502.5 = ...\n\nWait, 15 + 990 is 1005, divided by 2 is 502.5\n\nSo, 66 * 502.5\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n66 * 500 = 33,000\n\n66 * 2.5 = 165\n\nSo, 33,000 + 165 = 33,165\n\nTherefore, the sum of multiples of 15 is 33,165.\n\nNow, plugging back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nSum = 166,833 + 99,500 - 33,165\n\nLet's do the math step by step.\n\nFirst, 166,833 + 99,500 = 266,333\n\nThen, 266,333 - 33,165 = 233,168\n\nSo, the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 should be 233,168.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, sum of multiples of 3: 333 * 501 = 333 * 500 + 333 * 1 = 166,500 + 333 = 166,833. That seems correct.\n\nSum of multiples of 5: 199 * 500 = 99,500. That also seems correct.\n\nSum of multiples of 15: 66 * 502.5 = 33,165. That seems right too.\n\nNow, adding 166,833 and 99,500: 166,833 + 99,500 = 266,333\n\nSubtracting 33,165: 266,333 - 33,165\n\nLet's verify this subtraction.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n3 - 5 can't be done, so borrow 1 from the tens place.\n\n13 - 5 = 8\n\n3 (from the tens place, now 2 after borrowing) - 6 = can't be done, so borrow 1 from the hundreds place.\n\n12 - 6 = 6\n\n6 (from the hundreds place, now 5 after borrowing) - 1 = 4\n\n5 - 3 = 2\n\n2 - 3 can't be done, so borrow 1 from the thousands place.\n\n12 - 3 = 9\n\n6 (from the thousands place, now 5 after borrowing) - 3 = 2\n\n2 - 0 = 2\n\nSo, 266,333 - 33,165 = 233,168\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 233,168.\n\nBut wait a minute, I recall that in Project Euler Problem 1, which is similar, the sum is 233,168. So, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a formula to directly calculate this sum.\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nThe sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 can be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle, as I did, or perhaps there's a more general formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could write a simple program to iterate through all numbers below 1000 and add up those that are multiples of 3 or 5.\n\nLet me consider that approach as well, to verify my answer.\n\nHere's a simple Python-like pseudocode:\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, 1000):\n\nif i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:\n\nsum += i\n\nprint(sum)\n\nIf I run this code, it should give me the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I'll trust that the inclusion-exclusion method I used is correct, and the sum is indeed 233,168.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series for each set and then combine them appropriately.\n\nI already did that, so I think I'm good.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there are any numbers below 1000 that are multiples of both 3 and 5, which are the multiples of 15, and ensure I've handled them correctly.\n\nYes, I've subtracted the sum of multiples of 15 to correct for double-counting.\n\nI don't think there are any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 233,168.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{233168} \\]"
