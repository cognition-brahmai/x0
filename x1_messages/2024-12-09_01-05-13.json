        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a box with red and blue balls, and the probabilities of picking each are given\u201460% for red and 40% for blue. I need to find the ratio of red balls to blue balls based on these probabilities.\n\nFirst, I should recall that probability is basically the likelihood of an event happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the probability of picking a red ball is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls in the box.\n\nLet me denote:\n- R as the number of red balls,\n- B as the number of blue balls,\n- and T as the total number of balls, which is R + B.\n\nGiven that the probability of picking a red ball is 60%, or 0.6, I can write this as:\n\nR / T = 0.6\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball is 40%, or 0.4, so:\n\nB / T = 0.4\n\nNow, since T is R + B, I can substitute that in:\n\nR / (R + B) = 0.6\n\nAnd\n\nB / (R + B) = 0.4\n\nI need to find the ratio of R to B, which is R:B.\n\nTo find this ratio, I can express R in terms of B or vice versa.\n\nLet me solve the first equation for R:\n\nR = 0.6 * (R + B)\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\nB = 0.4 * (R + B)\n\nBut maybe it's easier to divide the two equations.\n\nIf I divide the first equation by the second equation, I get:\n\n(R / T) / (B / T) = 0.6 / 0.4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nR / B = 1.5\n\nSo, the ratio of red balls to blue balls is 1.5:1.\n\nBut ratios are often expressed in whole numbers, so I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n1.5:1 = 3:2\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 3:2.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf there are 3 red balls and 2 blue balls, the total is 5 balls.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball would be 3/5 = 0.6 or 60%, which matches the given probability.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball would be 2/5 = 0.4 or 40%, which also matches.\n\nSo, yes, the ratio is indeed 3:2.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this by setting up equations.\n\nLet\u2019s say there are R red balls and B blue balls.\n\nThen, the total number of balls is R + B.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball is R / (R + B) = 0.6\n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a blue ball is B / (R + B) = 0.4\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nR = 0.6 * (R + B)\n\nR = 0.6R + 0.6B\n\nSubtract 0.6R from both sides:\n\n0.4R = 0.6B\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nR = (0.6 / 0.4) * B\n\nR = 1.5B\n\nSo, R:B = 1.5:1, which is the same as 3:2.\n\nAgain, this confirms the ratio is 3:2.\n\nI think that\u2019s straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider if there are other factors that might affect the probability, but in this problem, it seems straightforward. There\u2019s no mention of replacing balls or multiple draws, so it\u2019s a simple probability question.\n\nAlso, assuming that each ball is equally likely to be picked, which is usual in these kinds of problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, the ratio of red balls to blue balls is 3:2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3:2} \\]"
