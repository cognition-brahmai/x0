        "content": "So the car is traveling at different speeds during different parts of the trip. For the first 2 hours, it's going 60 miles per hour, and then for the next 3 hours, it's going 50 miles per hour. I need to find out the total miles traveled.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the distance traveled during each part of the trip and then add them together to get the total distance.\n\nSo, for the first part, the car travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. I know that distance equals speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nSo, for the first part: distance = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nThen, for the second part, the car travels at 50 miles per hour for 3 hours. Again, using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nSo, for the second part: distance = 50 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 150 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together: 120 miles + 150 miles = 270 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to think about this? Maybe combining the speeds or something. Let's see.\n\nTotal time traveled is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nIf I try to find the average speed over the entire trip, maybe that could help. Average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nBut in this case, I don't know the total distance yet, which is what I'm trying to find. So maybe that's not helpful right now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the harmonic mean of the speeds, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nNah, I think the way I did it initially is correct. Calculate each part separately and then add them up.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst part: 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles. That seems right.\n\nSecond part: 50 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 150 miles. That also seems correct.\n\nTotal distance: 120 + 150 = 270 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. It seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
