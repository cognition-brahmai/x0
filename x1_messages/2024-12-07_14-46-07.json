        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem about planning a sports complex. The total area is 50 acres, and different parts of it are allocated for different facilities. The stadium takes up 30% of the space, the swimming pool occupies 20%, and the remaining area is for tennis courts and other amenities. I need to figure out how many tennis courts can be built if each one requires 0.5 acres of land.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the allocations. The stadium is 30% of 50 acres, and the swimming pool is 20% of 50 acres. The rest is for tennis courts and other amenities. So, I should probably calculate how much area is left after allocating space for the stadium and the swimming pool.\n\nLet me start by calculating the area for the stadium. 30% of 50 acres is:\n\n0.30 * 50 = 15 acres\n\nNext, the swimming pool occupies 20% of 50 acres:\n\n0.20 * 50 = 10 acres\n\nNow, to find the remaining area for tennis courts and other amenities, I'll subtract the areas of the stadium and swimming pool from the total area:\n\n50 - 15 - 10 = 25 acres\n\nSo, there are 25 acres left for tennis courts and other amenities.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of tennis courts that can be built, with each court requiring 0.5 acres. To find this, I need to divide the available area by the area required per tennis court:\n\n25 / 0.5 = 50 tennis courts\n\nWait a minute, but the remaining 25 acres are allocated for both tennis courts and other amenities. The problem doesn't specify how much of the remaining area is for tennis courts specifically. It just says \"the remaining area allocated for tennis courts and other amenities.\"\n\nDoes that mean that the entire 25 acres can be used for tennis courts, or is some of it reserved for other amenities?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify how the remaining area is divided between tennis courts and other amenities. It just says \"remaining area allocated for tennis courts and other amenities.\" So, if I assume that all of the remaining area can be used for tennis courts, then I can proceed with the calculation above.\n\nAlternatively, if some of the remaining area must be used for other amenities, then the number of tennis courts would be less. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's safe to assume that the entire remaining area can be used for tennis courts.\n\nTherefore, the number of tennis courts that can be built is 50.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal area: 50 acres\n\nStadium: 30% of 50 = 0.30 * 50 = 15 acres\n\nSwimming pool: 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 acres\n\nRemaining area: 50 - 15 - 10 = 25 acres\n\nEach tennis court requires 0.5 acres, so number of courts = 25 / 0.5 = 50\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of percentages. The stadium takes 30%, swimming pool takes 20%, so together they take 50%. Therefore, the remaining 50% is for tennis courts and other amenities.\n\n50% of 50 acres is 25 acres, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 50 tennis courts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
