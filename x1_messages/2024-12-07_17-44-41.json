        "content": "To calculate the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 1, we'll use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x\u207f, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x\u207f\u207b\u00b9.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the function:\n\n1. For the term 3x\u00b2:\n\n- The coefficient is 3.\n\n- The exponent is 2.\n\n- Applying the power rule: derivative = 3 * 2 * x^(2-1) = 6x.\n\n2. For the term 4x:\n\n- The coefficient is 4.\n\n- The exponent is 1 (since x = x\u00b9).\n\n- Applying the power rule: derivative = 4 * 1 * x^(1-1) = 4 * 1 * x\u2070 = 4 * 1 * 1 = 4.\n\n3. For the constant term -1:\n\n- The derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 4 + 0 = 6x + 4.\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 1 is f'(x) = 6x + 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6x + 4} \\]"
