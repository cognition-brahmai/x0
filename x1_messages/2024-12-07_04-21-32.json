        "content": "So I've got this problem here about maximizing revenue for a company. The revenue is given by the equation R = 1000x - 50x\u00b2, where x is the number of units sold. I need to find out how many units must be sold to make the revenue as big as possible.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what this equation is telling me. It looks like a quadratic equation, right? It's in the form of R = ax - bx\u00b2, where a is 1000 and b is 50. Quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative (-50), that means the parabola opens downwards. So, it has a maximum point, which is the vertex.\n\nMy goal is to find the value of x that gives the maximum revenue, which is the x-coordinate of the vertex of this parabola.\n\nI remember there's a formula to find the vertex of a parabola given by y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, and the x-coordinate of the vertex is x = -b/(2a). But wait, in this equation, it's R = -50x\u00b2 + 1000x. So, comparing it to the standard form, a = -50 and b = 1000.\n\nSo, plugging into the vertex formula:\n\nx = -b/(2a) = -1000 / (2 * -50) = -1000 / -100 = 10.\n\nSo, x = 10.\n\nDoes that mean selling 10 units will maximize the revenue?\n\nLet me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach it, just to confirm.\n\nAnother way to find the maximum is to take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to x and set it to zero.\n\nSo, R = 1000x - 50x\u00b2.\n\nThe derivative dR/dx = 1000 - 100x.\n\nSet that equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n1000 - 100x = 0\n\n100x = 1000\n\nx = 10.\n\nOkay, same answer. That's a good sign.\n\nTo make sure it's a maximum, I can check the second derivative:\n\nd\u00b2R/dx\u00b2 = -100.\n\nSince that's negative, it confirms that x = 10 is a maximum point.\n\nAlright, so selling 10 units will maximize the revenue.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of the business. If the company sells too few units, it's not fully utilizing its potential. If it sells too many, maybe there are diminishing returns or increased costs that cut into the revenue. This equation suggests that there's an optimal point at 10 units.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should calculate the revenue at x = 10 and compare it to nearby values to ensure it's indeed the maximum.\n\nAt x = 10:\n\nR = 1000*(10) - 50*(10)^2 = 10,000 - 50*100 = 10,000 - 5,000 = 5,000.\n\nAt x = 9:\n\nR = 1000*(9) - 50*(9)^2 = 9,000 - 50*81 = 9,000 - 4,050 = 4,950.\n\nAt x = 11:\n\nR = 1000*(11) - 50*(11)^2 = 11,000 - 50*121 = 11,000 - 6,050 = 4,950.\n\nSo, indeed, at x = 10, the revenue is higher than at x = 9 or x = 11, both of which give lower revenues of 4,950.\n\nTherefore, the company should aim to sell 10 units to maximize its revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
