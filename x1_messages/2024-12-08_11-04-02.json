CFOP stands for Cross, First two layers (F2L), Orientation of last layer (OLL), and Permutation of the last layer (PLL). It's one of the most popular methods for speedcubing because it minimizes the number of moves and allows for quick recognition and execution. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**1. Cross**\n\nThe first step is to solve the cross on one face of the cube, usually the white face. This involves matching the edge pieces with their corresponding center pieces.\n\n*Example:*\n\nLet's say you have the white center piece on the bottom. You need to form a white cross by matching the edge pieces with the center pieces of the corresponding colors (green, blue, red, orange).\n\n- Find the white-blue edge piece and place it between the white and blue center pieces.\n\n- Do the same for the other edges.\n\nTips:\n\n- Look for matching colors.\n\n- Try to do this intuitively without memorizing algorithms.\n\n**2. First Two Layers (F2L)**\n\nIn this step, you solve the corner and edge pairs of the first two layers simultaneously. This reduces the number of algorithms you need to memorize.\n\n*Example:*\n\nAfter solving the cross, you should have the white cross on the bottom. Now, look for the white corner pieces and pair them with the correct edge pieces to form pairs.\n\n- Find a white corner piece and match it with the corresponding center pieces.\n\n- Pair it with the correct edge piece to form a 2-piece unit.\n\n- Insert this unit into the correct slot in the first two layers.\n\nTips:\n\n- Practice recognizing and pairing the pieces quickly.\n\n- Try to do this intuitively, but you might need to learn a few algorithms for tricky cases.\n\n**3. Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL)**\n\nIn this step, you orient the pieces of the last layer so that they all have the same color facing up. This is usually yellow if white was your cross color.\n\n*Example:*\n\nSuppose your last layer has a mix of yellow and other colors on top. You need to flip the pieces so that only yellow faces up.\n\n- Identify the pattern of the last layer.\n\n- Apply the appropriate OLL algorithm to orient the pieces correctly.\n\nTips:\n\n- There are about 57 OLL algorithms to memorize, but many are mirrors of each other.\n\n- Practice recognizing the patterns quickly.\n\n**4. Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL)**\n\nThe final step is to permute the last layer, which means moving the pieces around so that they are in their correct positions.\n\n*Example:*\n\nYour last layer has all yellow facing up, but the pieces are not in their correct positions. You need to cycle them into place.\n\n- Identify the permutation pattern.\n\n- Apply the corresponding PLL algorithm to solve the cube.\n\nTips:\n\n- There are 21 PLL algorithms to memorize.\n\n- Practice recognizing the patterns and executing the algorithms quickly.\n\nBy following these steps and practicing each stage, you'll be able to solve the Rubik's cube efficiently using the CFOP method. Good luck!"
