Each apartment has 3 rooms, and in each room, there are 2 people living. We need to find out how many legs there are in the building in total.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many people are living in the building. Since each person has 2 legs, once I know the number of people, I can easily find the total number of legs.\n\nSo, let's start by calculating the number of apartments in the building. There are 5 floors, and each floor has 4 apartments. So, the total number of apartments is:\n\n5 floors * 4 apartments per floor = 20 apartments\n\nNext, each apartment has 3 rooms. So, the total number of rooms in the building is:\n\n20 apartments * 3 rooms per apartment = 60 rooms\n\nNow, each room has 2 people living in it. Therefore, the total number of people in the building is:\n\n60 rooms * 2 people per room = 120 people\n\nSince each person has 2 legs, the total number of legs is:\n\n120 people * 2 legs per person = 240 legs\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I should consider if there are any other legs in the building, like pets or something. But the problem doesn't mention any pets, so I think it's safe to assume that only human legs are being considered here.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no other factors to consider. For example, maybe some rooms are not living rooms, or maybe some apartments are empty. But according to the problem, each apartment has 3 rooms, and each room has 2 people, so I think the calculation is accurate based on the given information.\n\nSo, the total number of legs in the building is 240.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
