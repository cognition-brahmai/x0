So, 3 plus 1 is 4 apples.\n\nAfter that, my friend takes away 3 apples. So, 4 minus 3 is 1 apple left.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that.\n\nStart with 5 apples.\n\nTake away 2: 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nBring back 1: 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nFriend takes away 3: 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, there is 1 apple left on the table.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
