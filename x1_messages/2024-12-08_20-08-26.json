        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a box with balls of different colors: 10 red, 5 blue, and 15 green. I need to find the probability of picking either a red or a blue ball at random. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball, and the total outcomes are the total number of balls in the box.\n\nSo, let's find out the total number of balls. There are 10 red, 5 blue, and 15 green balls. Adding those up: 10 + 5 + 15 = 30 balls in total.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are picking either a red or a blue ball. There are 10 red balls and 5 blue balls, so the total number of favorable outcomes is 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the probability P of picking either a red or a blue ball is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 15 divided by 30. So, P = 15/30.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 15, which gives P = 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this in terms of percentages. 15 out of 30 is the same as 50%.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2 or 50%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the probability of not picking a green ball, since the only other options are red and blue.\n\nYes, that's another way. The probability of picking either red or blue is the same as the probability of not picking a green ball.\n\nThere are 15 green balls out of 30, so the probability of picking a green ball is 15/30 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not picking a green ball is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nGood, it's consistent.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of balls is indeed 10 red + 5 blue + 15 green = 30 balls.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is 10 red + 5 blue = 15 balls.\n\nSo, 15/30 = 1/2. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, probability of not picking green (which is the same as picking red or blue) is 1 - (15/30) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/2 or 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]"
