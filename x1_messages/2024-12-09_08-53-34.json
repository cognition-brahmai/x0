        "content": "So I have this problem: if a baker uses 2 eggs to make 3 cupcakes, how many eggs does he need to make 27 cupcakes? And I need to show my calculations.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It seems like a proportion problem. The baker uses 2 eggs for every 3 cupcakes. So, I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 27 cupcakes.\n\nFirst, I can set up a proportion to represent this relationship. Let's let x be the number of eggs needed for 27 cupcakes. So, the proportion would be:\n\n2 eggs / 3 cupcakes = x eggs / 27 cupcakes\n\nNow, to solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n2 eggs * 27 cupcakes = 3 cupcakes * x eggs\n\nThat gives:\n\n54 = 3x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\n54 / 3 = x\n\nSo, x = 18\n\nTherefore, the baker needs 18 eggs to make 27 cupcakes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way is to find out how many sets of 3 cupcakes are there in 27 cupcakes. Since 27 divided by 3 is 9, there are 9 sets of 3 cupcakes in 27.\n\nSince each set of 3 cupcakes requires 2 eggs, then for 9 sets, you would need 9 times 2 eggs.\n\nSo, 9 * 2 = 18 eggs.\n\nThat matches my previous answer.\n\nLet me try another approach to be sure. Maybe using ratios.\n\nThe ratio of eggs to cupcakes is 2:3. I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 27 cupcakes.\n\nSo, the ratio is 2 eggs / 3 cupcakes = x eggs / 27 cupcakes.\n\nAgain, cross-multiplying:\n\n2 * 27 = 3 * x\n\n54 = 3x\n\nx = 54 / 3\n\nx = 18\n\nSame answer again. So, I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of unit rates. Find out how many eggs are needed per cupcake, and then multiply by 27.\n\nSo, 2 eggs for 3 cupcakes means 2/3 eggs per cupcake.\n\nThen, for 27 cupcakes: 2/3 eggs/cupcake * 27 cupcakes = (2/3)*27 = 18 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think no matter which way I approach this, the answer comes out to be 18 eggs.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there anything else that affects the number of eggs needed besides the number of cupcakes?\n\nWell, in a real-world scenario, maybe the recipe requires certain eggs for the overall batch, regardless of the number of cupcakes. But based on the problem, it seems straightforward: the eggs are directly proportional to the number of cupcakes.\n\nSo, I don't think there are any additional factors to consider here.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 18 eggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
