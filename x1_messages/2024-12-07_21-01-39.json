The city is built on a group of 118 small islands separated by canals and linked by bridges. It's known for its stunning architecture, like the Doge's Palace and St. Mark's Basilica, and of course, the iconic gondolas that glide through the city's waterways. So, yeah, I believe \"The Floating City\" refers to Venice, Italy."
