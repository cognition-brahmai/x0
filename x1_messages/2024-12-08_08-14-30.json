        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a car rental company with a total of 500 cars in their fleet. They manage to rent out 75% of these cars every day. Each car that's rented out brings in $50 per day. We need to find out how much revenue the company generates in one month.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many cars are rented out each day. Since they rent out 75% of their 500 cars daily, I can calculate that by multiplying 500 by 75% or 0.75.\n\nCars rented per day = 500 * 0.75 = 375 cars\n\nSo, 375 cars are rented out each day.\n\nNext, each of these rented cars brings in $50 per day. Therefore, the daily revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars rented per day by the rental rate per car.\n\nDaily revenue = 375 cars * $50/car = $18,750\n\nNow, to find the monthly revenue, I need to know how many days are in a month. Typically, a month has about 30 days. So, I'll multiply the daily revenue by 30 to get the monthly revenue.\n\nMonthly revenue = $18,750/day * 30 days = $562,500\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there's any other factor I'm missing. The problem mentions that they rent out 75% of the cars every day, and each car rents for $50 per day. Assuming that all rented cars are rented for the entire day and there are no partial days or other complicating factors, this should be correct.\n\nAlso, I assumed that a month has 30 days for simplicity. In reality, months have varying numbers of days, from 28 to 31, but using 30 as an average is reasonable for this calculation.\n\nSo, the company generates approximately $562,500 in revenue per month from car rentals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{562500} \\]"
