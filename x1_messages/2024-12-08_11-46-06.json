        "content": "Let's see. So, the train goes from Town A to Town B, which are 300 miles apart, and it takes 5 hours to get there. It's traveling at a constant speed. First, I need to find out what that speed is.\n\nSpeed is distance divided by time, right? So, speed equals 300 miles divided by 5 hours, which is 60 miles per hour.\n\nNow, if the train had traveled 50% faster, that means its speed would be increased by 50% of its original speed.\n\nSo, 50% of 60 miles per hour is 0.5 times 60, which is 30 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, the new speed would be 60 plus 30, which is 90 miles per hour.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it would take to travel the same 300 miles at this new speed of 90 miles per hour.\n\nTime is distance divided by speed, so time equals 300 miles divided by 90 miles per hour.\n\nLet me calculate that: 300 divided by 90 is approximately 3.333 hours.\n\nTo express that in hours and minutes, 0.333 hours is roughly 20 minutes, because 0.333 times 60 minutes is about 20 minutes.\n\nSo, it would take approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes to reach Town B if the train traveled 50% faster.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, since the speed is increased by 50%, the time should decrease proportionally.\n\nIf the original speed is v, and the new speed is 1.5v, then the new time t' is equal to the original time t multiplied by (v / 1.5v), which simplifies to t / 1.5.\n\nSo, t' = 5 hours / 1.5, which is approximately 3.333 hours, or 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours and } 20 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
