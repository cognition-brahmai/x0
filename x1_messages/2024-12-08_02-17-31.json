        "content": "I believe the author you're referring to is Virginia Woolf. \"To the Lighthouse\" is one of her most famous works, and Vanessa Bell, who was indeed her sister and a member of the Bloomsbury Group, created illustrations for some editions of the book. The Bloomsbury Group was a collective of English writers, intellectuals, philosophers, and artists who were influential in the early 20th century. So, yes, Virginia Woolf is the author of \"To the Lighthouse,\" and her sister Vanessa Bell provided illustrations for it."
