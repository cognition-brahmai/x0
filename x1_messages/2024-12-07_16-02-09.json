        "content": "So I've got this problem here. It says that in a town, 60% of the people have dogs, and 40% have cats. Also, 25% have both dogs and cats. I need to find out what percentage of dog owners also own cats.\n\nAlright, let's try to break this down. I think this is a problem about sets and maybe some Venn diagrams could help visualize it, but since I can't draw here, I'll just think through it.\n\nSo, first, 60% of people have dogs. That's one set. Then, 40% have cats. There's an overlap between these two sets where people have both pets, and that's 25% of the people.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the percentage of dog owners who also own cats. So, I need to find out, out of all the people who have dogs, what percentage of them also have cats.\n\nI think this is a conditional probability problem. It's like, what's the probability of owning a cat given that you own a dog.\n\nIn probability terms, that's P(Cats | Dogs), which is read as \"the probability of cats given dogs.\"\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(Cats | Dogs) = P(Dogs and Cats) / P(Dogs)\n\nFrom the problem, P(Dogs) is 60%, and P(Dogs and Cats) is 25%.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(Cats | Dogs) = 25% / 60%\n\nNow, to calculate that:\n\n25 divided by 60 is like 0.4167, which is approximately 41.67%.\n\nSo, about 41.67% of dog owners also own cats.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"what percentage of dog owners also own cats,\" and according to my calculation, it's about 41.67%. But I should double-check this because sometimes these probability problems can be tricky.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I should consider the total percentage of people who have both pets in relation to those who have dogs.\n\nSo, out of 100% of people:\n\n- 60% have dogs\n\n- 40% have cats\n\n- 25% have both\n\nSo, the number of people who have only dogs would be 60% minus the 25% who have both, which is 35%.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who have only cats would be 40% minus 25%, which is 15%.\n\nAnd then, 25% have both.\n\nNow, among the dog owners, which are 60% of the people, 25% of the total population have both. So, to find the percentage of dog owners who also have cats, I can think of it as:\n\n(people who have both) / (total dog owners) * 100%\n\nSo, that's 25% / 60% * 100% = 41.67%.\n\nHmm, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Total population = 100%\n\n- Dog owners (D) = 60%\n\n- Cat owners (C) = 40%\n\n- Both dogs and cats (D \u2229 C) = 25%\n\nNow, the percentage of dog owners who also own cats is the size of the intersection divided by the size of the dog owners set.\n\nSo, (D \u2229 C) / D * 100% = 25% / 60% * 100% = 41.67%.\n\nWait, I keep getting the same answer. Maybe it is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of actual numbers to make it clearer.\n\nSuppose there are 100 people in the town.\n\n- 60 have dogs\n\n- 40 have cats\n\n- 25 have both\n\nSo, among the 60 dog owners, 25 also have cats.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of dog owners who have cats is (25 / 60) * 100% = 41.67%.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the percentage of people who have either a dog or a cat or both, it would be:\n\nP(D or C) = P(D) + P(C) - P(D and C) = 60% + 40% - 25% = 75%.\n\nSo, 75% of people have either a dog, a cat, or both.\n\nBut the question isn't asking for that. It's specifically asking for the percentage of dog owners who also have cats.\n\nSo, sticking with my earlier calculation, I think 41.67% is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility that the 25% who have both are included in the 60% who have dogs and the 40% who have cats?\n\nYes, that's standard in these types of problems. The \"both\" group is included in both the dog owners and cat owners groups.\n\nSo, when we're looking at dog owners, that's 60% including those who have both.\n\nSimilarly, cat owners are 40%, including those who have both.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of dog owners who also have cats is indeed the intersection divided by the dog owners, which is 25% / 60% = 41.67%.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use probabilities:\n\nP(Cats | Dogs) = P(Dogs and Cats) / P(Dogs) = 0.25 / 0.60 = 0.4167 or 41.67%.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that 41.67% is the correct percentage of dog owners who also own cats.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{41.67\\%} \\]"
