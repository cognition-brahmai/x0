Now, before you get too excited, let's keep the superhero stuff to a minimum today. We've got more important things to discuss.\n\nFirst off, I want to say that I'm standing here not just because I built a suit of armor and decided to swing around in it, saving the world every now and then. No, what brought me here is something much more profound\u2014it's the power of innovation, the drive to push boundaries, and the belief that technology can be our greatest ally in creating a better tomorrow.\n\nNow, some of you might be thinking, \"Tony Stark, the playboy billionaire, talking about responsibility and bettering the world?\" Well, yes, that's me. Because let's face it, with great power comes great responsibility, as my friend Uncle Ben always said. And in this room, each and one of you holds immense power\u2014 the power to create, to invent, to disrupt, and to inspire.\n\nI started off building weapons, and let me tell you, it was a path that led to some dark places. But through that journey, I learned that technology isn't inherently good or bad; it's how we choose to use it that defines its impact. So, I made a choice to use my gifts, my intellect, and my resources to make a positive difference. And that's what I want to encourage all of you to do today.\n\nWe live in an era where technology is advancing at a breakneck speed. AI, robotics, quantum computing, biotechnology\u2014these are no longer science fiction concepts; they're realities that are transforming our world in ways we could barely imagine just a decade ago. But with these incredible advancements come great challenges. Privacy concerns, job displacement, ethical dilemmas\u2014these are issues that we cannot ignore.\n\nSo, how do we navigate this complex landscape? How do we ensure that technology serves humanity rather than controlling it? The answer lies in empathy, in understanding that behind every line of code, every algorithm, every gadget, there are real people with real needs and real emotions.\n\nLet me share a personal story with you. When I first created Iron Man, it was out of necessity, out of a desire to save my own skin. But as time went on, I realized that the same technology could be used to protect others, to make the world a safer place. That shift in perspective was transformative for me. It taught me that true innovation isn't just about what we can do; it's about what we should do.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that we should all become superheroes overnight. What I am saying is that each one of us has the potential to make a significant impact, no matter how small it may seem. Whether it's developing a life-saving app, creating sustainable energy solutions, or simply using technology to connect people across the globe, every effort counts.\n\nBut it's not just about the end product; it's about the process, about the mindset we bring to our work. We need to approach technology with a sense of curiosity, a willingness to take risks, and an unyielding commitment to ethical standards. Because, let's face it, with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nI've made my share of mistakes. I've pushed boundaries that perhaps I shouldn't have, and I've faced the consequences head-on. But each mistake has been a learning experience, a stepping stone to becoming a better inventor, a better leader, and a better person.\n\nSo, to all of you out there who are passionate about technology, who dream of changing the world through innovation, I say this: don't be afraid to dream big. Don't let anyone tell you that your ideas are too far-fetched or that they'll never work. Because the truth is, the most groundbreaking innovations often come from those who dare to think differently.\n\nBut along with dreaming big, remember to stay grounded. Remember that technology is a tool, a means to an end, not an end in itself. It's about solving real problems, improving people's lives, and making the world a better place.\n\nAnd finally, never underestimate the power of collaboration. No man is an island, and in the world of technology, that rings especially true. The greatest achievements are often the result of teamwork, of minds coming together to tackle challenges that no single individual could overcome alone.\n\nSo, let's embark on this journey together, driven by passion, guided by ethics, and united by our vision of a brighter future. Let's harness the power of technology to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, where innovation knows no bounds, and where the impossible becomes possible.\n\nThank you.\n\n**#InnovateForGood**\n\n**#TechWithHeart**"
