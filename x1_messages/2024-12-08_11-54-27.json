        "content": "So I have this problem here: a car travels 400 miles on a full tank of gas, and the gas tank holds 12 gallons. I need to find out its fuel efficiency in miles per gallon. Alright, fuel efficiency is usually measured as how many miles the car can travel per gallon of gas. So, if the car can go 400 miles on 12 gallons, I think I need to divide the miles by the gallons to get miles per gallon.\n\nLet me write that down: miles per gallon = miles traveled / gallons of gas. So, plugging in the numbers: miles per gallon = 400 miles / 12 gallons. Now, if I do that division, 400 divided by 12, let's see.\n\n400 divided by 12. Well, 12 times 33 is 396, which is close to 400. So, 12 times 33 is 396, and 400 minus 396 is 4, so there's a remainder of 4. That means 33 and 4/12, which simplifies to 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon.\n\nAlternatively, I can do it with decimals. 400 divided by 12 is approximately 33.333... So, about 33.3 miles per gallon.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if this is exact. Let me do the division more carefully. 12 times 33 is 396, and 400 minus 396 is 4. So, 4 divided by 12 is 1/3, so indeed, it's 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal form, it's approximately 33.3 miles per gallon.\n\nSo, the car's fuel efficiency is 33.3 miles per gallon.\n\nBut, to be precise, it's 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as a fraction: 400 miles / 12 gallons = 100/3 miles per gallon, which is approximately 33.333... miles per gallon.\n\nSo, the exact value is 100/3 miles per gallon, which is 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon.\n\nBut in practical terms, people often use the decimal approximation, so 33.3 miles per gallon is fine.\n\nWait, but the question might be expecting the exact value. Let me see.\n\nIt says \"what is its fuel efficiency in miles per gallon?\" It doesn't specify if it wants the exact value or an approximation.\n\nGiven that 400 divided by 12 is exactly 100/3, which is 33.3 repeating, I think the best way to present it is as 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon, or possibly as the fraction 100/3 miles per gallon.\n\nAlternatively, if the context suggests rounding to a certain decimal place, I could do that. But since no specific instruction is given, I'll go with the exact value.\n\nSo, the car's fuel efficiency is 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to write it as a decimal, I can write it as 33.3 recurring, but to be precise, 33.3 with a bar over the 3 to indicate it repeats indefinitely.\n\nBut in most practical contexts, writing it as 33.3 miles per gallon is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, since the original data is given in whole numbers, perhaps I should express the answer as a fraction.\n\nLet me confirm the calculation again to be sure.\n\nThe car travels 400 miles on 12 gallons of gas.\n\nFuel efficiency = miles / gallons = 400 / 12.\n\nSimplify the fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 4.\n\n400 divided by 4 is 100, 12 divided by 4 is 3.\n\nSo, 100/3 miles per gallon.\n\nWhich is 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I convert 100/3 to a decimal, it's 33.333..., which is often approximated as 33.3 miles per gallon.\n\nBut to be precise, it's 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon.\n\nAlternatively, if the context allows, 100/3 miles per gallon is also acceptable.\n\nBut probably, expressing it as 33.3 miles per gallon is fine for most purposes.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify to round to a certain decimal place, perhaps I should stick with the exact fraction.\n\nSo, the car's fuel efficiency is 100/3 miles per gallon, or 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon.\n\nAlternatively, in decimal form, approximately 33.3 miles per gallon.\n\nBut to be precise, 33 and 1/3 miles per gallon is the exact value.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33.\\overline{3}\\ \\text{miles per gallon}} \\]"
