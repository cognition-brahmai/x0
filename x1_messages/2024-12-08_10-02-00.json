        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the logistics company wants to expand its operations by purchasing a fleet of delivery trucks. They have a budget of $1.5 million for this expansion. Each truck costs $75,000 and can carry 15 tons. Additionally, there are annual costs for fuel, insurance, and maintenance, which are estimated at $30,000 per truck per year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many trucks the company can buy with their $1.5 million budget. Since each truck costs $75,000, I can divide the total budget by the cost per truck to find out the number of trucks they can purchase.\n\nSo, number of trucks = total budget / cost per truck\n\nNumber of trucks = $1,500,000 / $75,000\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\n$1,500,000 divided by $75,000 is 20.\n\nSo, the company can purchase 20 trucks with their budget.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the annual operating costs for these trucks. Each truck has annual costs of $30,000 for fuel, insurance, and maintenance. Since they're buying 20 trucks, I can multiply the number of trucks by the annual cost per truck to get the total annual operating cost.\n\nTotal annual operating cost = number of trucks * annual cost per truck\n\nTotal annual operating cost = 20 * $30,000\n\nThat equals $600,000 per year.\n\nSo, the company can purchase 20 trucks within their $1.5 million budget, and the annual operating costs for these trucks would be $600,000.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check everything to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, the budget is $1.5 million, which is $1,500,000. Each truck costs $75,000. Dividing $1,500,000 by $75,000 does indeed give 20 trucks.\n\nNext, the annual cost per truck is $30,000. Multiplying that by 20 trucks gives $600,000 per year.\n\nSeems straightforward. However, I should consider if there are any other costs that might be associated with purchasing and operating the trucks that aren't mentioned here. For example, are there any one-time costs for things like driver training, vehicle registration, or initial maintenance that might eat into the budget? Also, is the $1.5 million solely for the purchase of the trucks, or does it include some of the operating costs as well?\n\nBut based on the information provided, the problem specifies that the $1.5 million is for the expansion, and the costs mentioned are the truck purchase price and annual operating costs. It doesn't appear that there are additional costs to consider in this calculation.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Number of trucks that can be purchased: 20\n\n- Annual operating costs: $600,000\n\nI think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20 \\text{ trucks, with annual operating costs of } \\$600,000} \\]"
