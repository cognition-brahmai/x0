        "content": "Let's see. There are red and blue balls in a box, and the total number of balls is 24. It's also said that the number of red balls is three times the number of blue balls. I need to find out how many blue balls there are.\n\nOkay, so let's assign variables to this. Let\u2019s say the number of blue balls is B. Then, since the number of red balls is three times the number of blue balls, the number of red balls would be 3B.\n\nNow, the total number of balls is the sum of red and blue balls, so that would be B + 3B = 4B. And we know that the total is 24 balls. So, 4B = 24.\n\nTo find B, I can divide both sides by 4. So, B = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 blue balls in the box.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 6 blue balls, then red balls would be 3 times that, which is 18. And 6 plus 18 is 24, which matches the total number of balls. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer: there are 6 blue balls."
