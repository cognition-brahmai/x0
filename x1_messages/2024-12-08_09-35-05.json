        "content": "Ah, you're referring to the iconic landmark in London that's often called Big Ben, but technically, that's not its correct name. Big Ben is actually the nickname for the Great Bell housed within the clock tower, not the tower itself. The clock tower's official name is the Elizabeth Tower, named after Queen Elizabeth II. It was renamed from the Clock Tower to the Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Elizabeth Tower is a prominent part of the Palace of Westminster, which houses the meeting chambers of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The tower stands at approximately 96 meters (315 feet) tall and is a symbol of the British political system and democracy.\n\nThe confusion between the tower and the bell arises because \"Big Ben\" is often used colloquially to refer to both the bell and the tower. The bell itself was cast in 1858 and has been a staple of London's soundscape, particularly known for its distinctive chimes that mark the hours.\n\nSo, to clarify, while many people refer to the entire structure as Big Ben, the accurate term for the clock tower is the Elizabeth Tower."
