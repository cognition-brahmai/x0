She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. Later, in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. Marie Curie is the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields."
