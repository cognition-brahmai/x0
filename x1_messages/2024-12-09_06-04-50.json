        "content": "So the store sells apples in bags, and each bag contains 6 apples. They sold 48 bags in one day. I need to find out how many individual apples that is.\n\nWell, if each bag has 6 apples, and they sold 48 bags, I think I just need to multiply the number of bags by the number of apples per bag. So, 48 bags times 6 apples per bag.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 48 times 6.\n\nFirst, 8 times 6 is 48. Then, 4 times 6 is 24, and since the 4 is in the tens place, it's actually 240. So, 240 plus 48 is 288.\n\nSo, they sold 288 individual apples that day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps I can think about it in terms of dozens, since 12 apples make a dozen, but the bags have 6 apples, which is half a dozen each.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Maybe it's simpler to stick with the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many apples are sold per bag and just add them up, but that would be time-consuming for 48 bags.\n\nOr, I could break down the multiplication into smaller parts. For example, 40 bags plus 8 bags.\n\nSo, 40 bags times 6 apples per bag is 240 apples. Then, 8 bags times 6 apples per bag is 48 apples. Adding those together, 240 plus 48, which again gives me 288 apples.\n\nThat matches my first calculation, so I'm more confident now.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use division to check this. If they sold 288 apples and each bag contains 6 apples, then the number of bags should be 288 divided by 6.\n\nLet's see: 288 divided by 6.\n\n6 times 48 is 288, so yes, that gives me 48 bags, which matches the original information.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each bag contains 6 apples, and they sold 48 bags, so the total number of apples is 6 multiplied by 48, which is 288.\n\nI could also consider the associative property of multiplication. For example, 6 times 48 is the same as 6 times (40 + 8), which is (6 times 40) plus (6 times 8), which is 240 plus 48, totaling 288.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can use a different method. Let's say I consider that every two bags contain 12 apples, which is a dozen. So, two bags = 12 apples.\n\nThen, 48 bags would be 24 sets of two bags, which would be 24 times 12 apples.\n\n24 times 12 is 288 apples.\n\nOnce again, the same result.\n\nI feel very confident now that the total number of apples sold that day is 288.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]"
