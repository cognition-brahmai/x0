        "content": "So, the problem says that a car can travel 400 miles on a full tank of gas. That means, when the tank is completely full, it has enough gas to go 400 miles.\n\nNow, the tank is currently half full. So, I need to find out how far the car can travel with this half tank.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much gas is in the tank right now. Since it's half full, it means it has half of the full tank's capacity.\n\nSo, if full tank = 400 miles, then half tank = 400 miles / 2.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. If full tank is 400 miles, then half tank should allow the car to travel half of that distance, right?\n\nLet me think again. No, wait. The full tank allows 400 miles, so half a tank should allow half of that, which is 200 miles.\n\nBut, let me make sure. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose the full tank holds a certain amount of gas, say, X gallons. And with X gallons, the car can travel 400 miles.\n\nThen, the car's fuel efficiency would be 400 miles per X gallons, which is 400/X miles per gallon.\n\nNow, if the tank is half full, it has X/2 gallons of gas.\n\nSo, the distance the car can travel with X/2 gallons would be:\n\nDistance = (fuel efficiency) * (amount of gas)\n\nWhich is (400/X) miles per gallon * (X/2) gallons.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(400/X) * (X/2) = (400 * X) / (X * 2) = 400/2 = 200 miles.\n\nSo, the car can travel 200 miles with a half-full tank.\n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this? Maybe in terms of proportions.\n\nIf full tank (100%) allows 400 miles, then half tank (50%) should allow half of 400 miles, which is 200 miles.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion:\n\nFull tank : full distance = half tank : half distance\n\nSo, 1 : 400 = 0.5 : d\n\nThen, d = 0.5 * 400 / 1 = 200 miles.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor to consider. For example, does the temperature affect gas volume? Or is there any efficiency loss?\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention any additional factors, so I think assuming constant conditions is fine.\n\nAlso, the problem states \"the tank is currently half full,\" so no need to consider partial consumption or anything like that.\n\nTherefore, the car can travel 200 miles with a half-full tank.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
