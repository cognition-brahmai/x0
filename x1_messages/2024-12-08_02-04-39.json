        "content": "So I've got this quadratic equation to solve: x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0. And I need to use the quadratic formula for it. Alright, let's recall what the quadratic formula is. It's a way to find the roots of any quadratic equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. The formula is:\n\nx = [ -b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac) ] / (2a)\n\nSo, first things first, I need to identify the coefficients a, b, and c from my equation. In my case, the equation is x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0. Comparing this to the standard form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, I can see that:\n\na = 1 (since x\u00b2 has a coefficient of 1)\n\nb = -5 (the coefficient of x is -5)\n\nc = 6 (the constant term is 6)\n\nAlright, now that I have a, b, and c, I can plug these values into the quadratic formula.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nx = [ -(-5) \u00b1 \u221a[ (-5)\u00b2 - 4(1)(6) ] ] / (2*1)\n\nLet's simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate -b:\n\n-b = -(-5) = 5\n\nNext, calculate the discriminant, which is b\u00b2 - 4ac:\n\nDiscriminant = (-5)\u00b2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1\n\nNow, the square root of the discriminant:\n\n\u221a1 = 1\n\nSo, now the formula becomes:\n\nx = [5 \u00b1 1] / 2\n\nNow, I need to consider both the plus and minus scenarios for the \u00b1 sign.\n\nFirst, for the plus sign:\n\nx = (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nAnd for the minus sign:\n\nx = (5 - 1) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 3 and x = 2.\n\nTo double-check, I can plug these values back into the original equation to see if they satisfy it.\n\nFirst, for x = 3:\n\n(3)\u00b2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, for x = 2:\n\n(2)\u00b2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth solutions check out. So, that's it! The equation x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0 has roots at x = 2 and x = 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ and } 3} \\]"
