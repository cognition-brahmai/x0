        "content": "So I've got this problem here: There are 12 coins, and one of them is counterfeit, weighing slightly less than the other 11 genuine coins. I have a balance scale, and I need to find out the minimum number of weighings required to identify the counterfeit coin.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the properties of the balance scale. A balance scale compares the weight of two groups of coins and tells me which group is heavier or if they are equal. Since the counterfeit coin is lighter, I can use this information to my advantage.\n\nI recall that with balance scales, each weighing can give me three possible outcomes: the left side is heavier, the right side is heavier, or both sides are equal. So, theoretically, each weighing can provide up to three different pieces of information.\n\nGiven that, I think I can use a ternary search strategy, where each weighing narrows down the possibilities by a factor of three.\n\nLet's think about how many possibilities there are. There are 12 coins, and any one of them could be the counterfeit. So, there are 12 possible scenarios.\n\nNow, with each weighing, I can reduce the number of possibilities by a factor of three. So, to find the minimum number of weighings required, I can use the formula:\n\nNumber of weighings \u2265 log\u2083(number of possibilities)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of weighings \u2265 log\u2083(12)\n\nCalculating log\u2083(12):\n\n3\u00b9 = 3\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n3\u00b3 = 27\n\nSo, log\u2083(9) = 2, and log\u2083(27) = 3. Since 12 is between 9 and 27, log\u2083(12) is between 2 and 3. Therefore, the minimum number of weighings required is 3.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if 3 weighings are indeed sufficient to identify the counterfeit coin among 12.\n\nLet me try to outline a strategy for 3 weighings.\n\nFirst weighing:\n\nI can divide the 12 coins into three groups of 4 coins each: Group A, Group B, and Group C.\n\nI weigh Group A against Group B.\n\n- If Group A is heavier than Group B, then the counterfeit coin is in Group B, since the counterfeit is lighter.\n\n- If Group B is heavier than Group A, then the counterfeit is in Group A.\n\n- If Group A and Group B are equal, then the counterfeit is in Group C.\n\nSo, after the first weighing, I have narrowed it down to 4 coins.\n\nSecond weighing:\n\nTake the group of 4 coins that contains the counterfeit and divide it into two groups of 2 coins each.\n\nWeigh one group of 2 against the other.\n\n- If one group is heavier, the counterfeit is in the lighter group.\n\n- If they are equal, then the counterfeit is in the remaining 2 coins that were not weighed.\n\nSo now, I have narrowed it down to 2 coins.\n\nThird weighing:\n\nTake the 2 remaining coins and weigh one against the other.\n\n- If one is lighter, that's the counterfeit.\n\n- If they are equal, then the counterfeit is the remaining coin that was not weighed.\n\nWait a minute, but if I have 2 coins left and I weigh one against the other, and they are equal, does that mean the counterfeit is the remaining coin? But in this scenario, I only have 2 coins left, and I've already established that the counterfeit is among these 2. So, if they are equal, does that mean both are genuine, which contradicts the initial assumption?\n\nI think there's a mistake in this approach.\n\nLet me rethink the second weighing.\n\nAfter the first weighing, I have narrowed it down to 4 coins.\n\nIn the second weighing, I take these 4 coins and divide them into two groups of 2 coins each and weigh them against each other.\n\n- If one group is lighter, then that group contains the counterfeit.\n\n- If they are equal, then the counterfeit is in the remaining 4 coins from the first weighing that were not weighed in this step.\n\nWait, but I only have 4 coins from the first weighing that contains the counterfeit. So, if I take 2 against 2, and they are equal, then the counterfeit must be in the remaining coins from the first weighing, but I already isolated the group of 4 coins that contains the counterfeit. So, if I take 2 against 2 and they are equal, then the counterfeit must be in the remaining 2 coins from that group of 4.\n\nThen, in the third weighing, I can take one of those 2 coins and weigh it against a known genuine coin (from the 8 coins that were not identified as containing the counterfeit).\n\n- If it's lighter, it's the counterfeit.\n\n- If it's equal, then the other coin is the counterfeit.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, in the third weighing, I can take the two remaining coins and weigh one against the other.\n\n- If one is lighter, it's the counterfeit.\n\n- If they are equal, then perhaps I've made a mistake, because I should have already isolated the counterfeit.\n\nWait, but if I have two coins left and I know one is counterfeit, and I weigh them against each other:\n\n- If they are equal, that would suggest both are genuine, which contradicts the initial assumption.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nFirst weighing:\n\nDivide the 12 coins into three groups of 4 coins each: A, B, and C.\n\nWeigh A against B.\n\n- If A is heavier than B, then the counterfeit is in B.\n\n- If B is heavier than A, then the counterfeit is in A.\n\n- If A and B are equal, then the counterfeit is in C.\n\nSo, in any case, I have narrowed it down to 4 coins.\n\nSecond weighing:\n\nTake the group of 4 coins that contains the counterfeit and divide it into two groups of 1 coin and one group of 2 coins.\n\nWait, perhaps better to divide it into groups of 1,1, and 2.\n\nNo, actually, it's better to divide the 4 coins into groups of 1,1,1, and 1.\n\nBut I need to balance them on the scale.\n\nAlternatively, take two coins from the group of 4 and weigh them against each other.\n\n- If one is lighter, that's the counterfeit.\n\n- If they are equal, then the counterfeit is in the remaining two coins.\n\nThen, in the third weighing, weigh one of the remaining two coins against a known genuine coin.\n\n- If it's lighter, it's the counterfeit.\n\n- If it's equal, then the other coin is the counterfeit.\n\nThis seems more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, in the second weighing, take two coins from the group of 4 and weigh them against two known genuine coins.\n\n- If the two coins are lighter, then the counterfeit is among them.\n\n- If they are equal, then the counterfeit is in the remaining two coins.\n\nThen, in the third weighing, weigh one of these two coins against a known genuine coin.\n\n- If it's lighter, it's the counterfeit.\n\n- If it's equal, the other coin is the counterfeit.\n\nThis also works.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I always have known genuine coins available for weighing.\n\nGiven that, I think this approach is valid.\n\nTherefore, 3 weighings are sufficient to identify the counterfeit coin among 12 coins.\n\nBut I recall that there is a classic problem of identifying a single counterfeit coin among 12 coins with only 3 weighings, and it's a well-known puzzle.\n\nSo, indeed, 3 weighings are sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of weighings needed is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
