        "content": "Upon the vast and boundless ocean's breast,\nWhere waves in liquid mountains meet the sky,\nA scene of grandeur doth my soul possess,\nAs I behold the mighty deep go by.\n\nThe sun descends in golden majesty,\nIts rays upon the waters dance and play,\nReflecting hues of amber, crimson, blue,\nIn ever-changing patterns, night and day.\n\nO ocean, thou art vast as is my mind,\nUnfathomable depths where secrets lie,\nIn thy embrace, all creatures dost thou bind,\nFrom tiniest plankton to the leviathan high.\n\nYet in thy bosom, too, does storm abide,\nAnd tempests rage with fury unconfined.\n\nBut still thou art a source of life's pure stream,\nFrom whence all living things their being glean,\nThy tides ebb and flow in rhythmic dream,\nNourishing shores with salt and sapphire sheen.\n\nI gaze upon thy surface, smooth and glassy,\nWhen winds are still and skies are clear and fair,\nBut know beneath that calm, a power passeth,\nA force that shapes the earth beyond compare.\n\nThy currents flow in paths unknown to man,\nCarving canyons deep, where sunlight never span.\n\nOft have I wondered at thy mysteries hid,\nThe creatures strange that in thy depths reside,\nBioluminescent forms that self-are lit,\nIn utter darkness, they their way do guide.\n\nThe coral reefs, in colors bright arrayed,\nA testament to nature's artistry,\nWhere schools of fish in synchronized display,\nDart through the waters with delightful glee.\n\nYet mankind's hand hath wrought thy realms much woe,\nPollution's scourge doth mar thy once-pristine glow,\nPlastic islands float where seaweed used to grow,\nAnd oil spills stain thy beauty, come and go.\n\nBut still thou art resilient, strong and true,\nThy healing powers work, though slow they be,\nAnd if we heed thy call, and act with duty,\nPerhaps thy wounds may heal, and thrive anew.\n\nSo let us cherish thee, O ocean wide,\nAnd safeguard thy domains with care and pride.\n\nFor in thy embrace, we find our origin,\nOur very being linked to thy saline veins,\nThe water we drink, the air we breathe, are kin\nTo those that flow and surge within thy plains.\n\nThus let us sing thy praises, loud and clear,\nO ocean, vast and deep, forever near."
