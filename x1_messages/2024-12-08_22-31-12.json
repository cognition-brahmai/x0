        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here. There are 4 cats, and each cat can catch 3 mice per hour. So, together, the cats can catch 4 times 3, which is 12 mice per hour. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, there are initially 12 mice, and the number of mice doubles every hour. So, starting at hour 0, there are 12 mice. After one hour, the number of mice doubles to 24, but during that hour, the cats have caught 12 mice. So, at the end of the first hour, the mice have doubled and then the cats have caught some.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the timing here. Does the number of mice double before the cats catch them, or after?\n\nAssuming that the mice double at the beginning of each hour and then the cats catch mice at the end of the hour.\n\nSo, at hour 0:\n\n- Mice: 12\n\nAt the start of hour 1:\n\n- Mice double to 24\n\n- Cats catch 12 mice\n\n- Mice left: 24 - 12 = 12\n\nAt the start of hour 2:\n\n- Mice double to 24\n\n- Cats catch 12 mice\n\n- Mice left: 24 - 12 = 12\n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern. Every hour, the mice double and then the cats catch 12 mice, but the number of mice remains at 12.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the mice double and then the cats catch 12, and the mice still remain at 12, that means that 12 mice double to 24, and then the cats catch 12, leaving 12 again.\n\nSo, it's like every hour, the mice population resets to 12 after the cats catch them.\n\nBut the question is, how many hours will it take for all the mice to be caught? Well, in this scenario, it seems like the mice population stays at 12 every hour because they double and then the cats catch 12.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because if the cats are catching all the new mice that are produced, but the population doesn't grow.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all the mice to be caught.\" So, if there are always 12 mice left after each hour, then technically, not all mice are being caught.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mice that are caught are removed permanently, and the remaining mice double next hour.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model this more carefully.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let M(h) be the number of mice at the start of hour h.\n\n- Initially, M(0) = 12.\n\nEach hour:\n\n1. The mice double: M(h) becomes 2 * M(h).\n\n2. The cats catch 12 mice: M(h) becomes 2 * M(h) - 12.\n\nWe need to find the smallest h such that M(h) <= 0, meaning all mice have been caught.\n\nWait, but mice can't have a negative number, so probably M(h) = 0 is the point where all mice are caught.\n\nSo, let's compute M(h) for each hour.\n\nAt h=0: M(0) = 12\n\nAt h=1:\n\n- Mice double: 24\n\n- Cats catch 12: 24 - 12 = 12\n\nSo, M(1) = 12\n\nAt h=2:\n\n- Mice double: 24\n\n- Cats catch 12: 24 - 12 = 12\n\nSo, M(2) = 12\n\nThis suggests that every hour, the mice population goes back to 12 after the cats catch them.\n\nThis seems like a steady state where the mice population doesn't grow because the cats catch as many as are produced.\n\nBut the problem is asking for when \"all the mice are caught.\" In this scenario, there are always 12 mice left after each hour.\n\nSo, perhaps in this model, the mice are never fully caught because there are always 12 left.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. Maybe I need to consider that the cats catch mice during the hour while the mice are doubling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mice double at the end of the hour after the cats have caught them.\n\nLet me try that alternative timing.\n\nSo, at the start of hour h:\n\n- Cats catch 12 mice\n\n- Remaining mice double\n\nThen:\n\nAt h=0:\n\n- Start with 12 mice\n\n- Cats catch 12 mice: 0 mice left\n\n- Mice double: 0 * 2 = 0\n\nSo, at the end of hour 1, there are 0 mice.\n\nWait, that's different.\n\nSo, in this scenario, if the cats catch mice first and then the remaining mice double, then in the first hour, the cats catch all 12 mice, leaving 0, which double to 0.\n\nSo, all mice are caught in 1 hour.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the number of mice doubles every hour, and the cats catch mice per hour, but it doesn't specify the timing of when the doubling happens relative to the catching.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the mice double during the hour, and the cats catch mice at a constant rate throughout the hour.\n\nIn that case, it's a bit more complicated, involving rates.\n\nLet's think in terms of rates.\n\nThe mice population doubles every hour, which means their growth rate is exponential.\n\nThe cats catch mice at a constant rate of 12 mice per hour (since 4 cats each catching 3 mice per hour).\n\nThis is similar to a exponential growth with a constant removal rate.\n\nThis can be modeled by a differential equation, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it discretely, with the mice doubling each hour and then the cats catching 12 mice at the end of the hour.\n\nSo, let's try that again.\n\nAt the start of hour h, there are M(h) mice.\n\nDuring the hour, the mice double: 2 * M(h)\n\nAt the end of the hour, cats catch 12 mice: 2 * M(h) - 12\n\nSo, M(h+1) = 2 * M(h) - 12\n\nWe need to find the smallest h such that M(h) <= 0.\n\nGiven M(0) = 12\n\nLet's compute M(h) for successive hours.\n\nh=0: M=12\n\nh=1: 2*12 - 12 = 12\n\nh=2: 2*12 - 12 = 12\n\nh=3: 2*12 - 12 = 12\n\n...\n\nIt seems like M(h) remains at 12 for all h.\n\nThis suggests that the mice population stays at 12 every hour because they double and then the cats catch 12.\n\nBut this seems odd because in reality, if the cats are catching mice as fast as they are reproducing, you might expect the population to stay constant, but the problem is about when all mice are caught.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the doubling happens instantaneously at the start of the hour, and then the cats catch mice uniformly throughout the hour.\n\nIn that case, if the cats catch mice at a rate of 12 per hour, and the mice are doubling at the start, it's still similar to the previous model.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a formula to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven M(h+1) = 2 * M(h) - 12, with M(0) = 12\n\nLet's try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, look for a particular solution. Assume M(h) = a * 2^h + b\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\na * 2^{h+1} + b = 2*(a * 2^h + b) - 12\n\nSimplify:\n\na * 2^{h+1} + b = a * 2^{h+1} + 2b - 12\n\nSubtract a * 2^{h+1} from both sides:\n\nb = 2b - 12\n\nSo, b = 12\n\nNow, the general solution is M(h) = a * 2^h + 12\n\nApply initial condition M(0) = 12:\n\na * 2^0 + 12 = 12\n\na + 12 = 12\n\na = 0\n\nSo, M(h) = 0 * 2^h + 12 = 12 for all h.\n\nThis confirms the earlier observation that M(h) remains 12 for all h.\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive because intuitively, one might think that eventually, the cats will catch all the mice.\n\nMaybe there's a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mice doubling happens continuously, while the cats catch mice at discrete intervals.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cats can only catch mice that are present at the time they catch them, meaning that the cats catch from the doubled amount at the end of the hour.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the cats catch mice at the end of the hour, after the mice have doubled.\n\nSo, at the start of hour h, there are M(h) mice.\n\nDuring the hour, mice double: 2 * M(h)\n\nAt the end of the hour, cats catch 12 mice: 2 * M(h) - 12\n\nSo, M(h+1) = 2 * M(h) - 12\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cats catch mice during the hour while the mice are doubling.\n\nThis would require a differential equation approach.\n\nLet\u2019s try modeling it with continuous-time equations.\n\nLet m(t) be the number of mice at time t.\n\nThe mice double every hour, which means m(t) = m(0) * e^{k t}, where k is the growth rate.\n\nGiven that m(t) doubles every hour, e^{k} = 2, so k = ln(2).\n\nSo, m(t) = m(0) * e^{ln(2) t} = m(0) * 2^t\n\nThe cats catch mice at a rate of 12 mice per hour.\n\nSo, the differential equation is:\n\ndm/dt = m * ln(2) - 12\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation.\n\nLet's solve it.\n\ndm/dt + (-ln(2)) m = -12\n\nThe integrating factor is e^{\u222b(-ln(2)) dt} = e^{-ln(2) t}\n\nMultiply both sides by the integrating factor:\n\ne^{-ln(2) t} dm/dt - ln(2) e^{-ln(2) t} m = -12 e^{-ln(2) t}\n\nThe left side is d/dt [m * e^{-ln(2) t}]\n\nSo,\n\nd/dt [m * e^{-ln(2) t}] = -12 e^{-ln(2) t}\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\nm * e^{-ln(2) t} = \u222b -12 e^{-ln(2) t} dt\n\n= (-12 / -ln(2)) e^{-ln(2) t} + c\n\n= (12 / ln(2)) e^{-ln(2) t} + c\n\nTherefore,\n\nm(t) = (12 / ln(2)) + c * e^{ln(2) t}\n\nApply initial condition m(0) = 12:\n\n12 = 12 / ln(2) + c\n\nc = 12 - 12 / ln(2)\n\nSo,\n\nm(t) = 12 / ln(2) + (12 - 12 / ln(2)) * 2^t\n\nWe need to find t such that m(t) = 0.\n\n0 = 12 / ln(2) + (12 - 12 / ln(2)) * 2^t\n\nLet's solve for 2^t:\n\n-12 / ln(2) = (12 - 12 / ln(2)) * 2^t\n\n2^t = (-12 / ln(2)) / (12 - 12 / ln(2))\n\nSimplify:\n\n2^t = [ -12 / ln(2) ] / [ 12 (1 - 1 / ln(2)) ]\n\n= [ -1 / ln(2) ] / [ 1 - 1 / ln(2) ]\n\n= [ -1 / ln(2) ] / [ (ln(2) - 1) / ln(2) ]\n\n= -1 / (ln(2) - 1)\n\n= 1 / (1 - ln(2))\n\nNow, take natural log on both sides:\n\nt * ln(2) = ln(1 / (1 - ln(2))) = -ln(1 - ln(2))\n\nTherefore,\n\nt = -ln(1 - ln(2)) / ln(2)\n\nLet's calculate this numerically.\n\nFirst, ln(2) \u2248 0.6931\n\n1 - ln(2) \u2248 1 - 0.6931 = 0.3069\n\nln(0.3069) \u2248 -1.18\n\nTherefore,\n\nt \u2248 -(-1.18) / 0.6931 \u2248 1.18 / 0.6931 \u2248 1.7 hours\n\nSo, it takes approximately 1.7 hours for all the mice to be caught.\n\nBut the problem is phrased in terms of hours, and likely expects an integer answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the discrete model is more appropriate for this problem.\n\nIn the discrete model, the mice population remains at 12 every hour, so in that case, the mice are never fully caught.\n\nBut in the continuous model, the mice population reaches zero at around 1.7 hours.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the problem statement, both interpretations are possible.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is that the mice are never fully caught, staying at 12 every hour.\n\nAlternatively, with the continuous model, it takes about 1.7 hours to catch all mice.\n\nI think the continuous model is more realistic, as it accounts for the continuous growth of the mouse population against the constant catching rate of the cats.\n\nTherefore, I would go with approximately 1.7 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.7} \\]"
