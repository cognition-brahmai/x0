        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a rectangular garden, and I need to figure out how many flowers can be planted along the perimeter, given that each flower needs 2 feet of space. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what the perimeter of a rectangle is.\n\nI remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula should be something like Perimeter equals 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Let me write that down:\n\nPerimeter (P) = 2 * length (L) + 2 * width (W)\n\nGiven that the length (L) is 20 feet and the width (W) is 12 feet, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 2 * 20 + 2 * 12\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n2 * 20 = 40 feet\n\n2 * 12 = 24 feet\n\nSo, the total perimeter is 40 + 24 = 64 feet.\n\nNow, each flower requires 2 feet of space. To find out how many flowers can be planted along the perimeter, I need to divide the total perimeter by the space required per flower.\n\nNumber of flowers = Perimeter / Space per flower\n\nNumber of flowers = 64 feet / 2 feet per flower\n\nThat gives me 32 flowers.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the flowers are being planted along the edges of the rectangle. So, along the length, which is 20 feet, each side can have 20 / 2 = 10 flowers. Since there are two lengths, that's 2 * 10 = 20 flowers.\n\nSimilarly, along the width, which is 12 feet, each side can have 12 / 2 = 6 flowers. There are two widths, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 flowers.\n\nAdding those up: 20 + 12 = 32 flowers.\n\nBut wait, at the corners, where the lengths and widths meet, would a flower be placed at each corner, or would the corner be shared between two sides? If flowers are placed at the corners, then perhaps some flowers are being double-counted in this method.\n\nLet me consider that. If flowers are placed at the corners, then each corner flower is shared between two sides. So, in the first method, where I added the flowers along the lengths and widths separately, the corner flowers would be counted twice.\n\nTo correct for that, I need to subtract the four corner flowers that were double-counted.\n\nSo, total number of flowers would be:\n\nFlowers along lengths: 2 * (20 / 2) = 2 * 10 = 20\n\nFlowers along widths: 2 * (12 / 2) = 2 * 6 = 12\n\nTotal: 20 + 12 = 32\n\nSubtract the 4 corner flowers that were double-counted: 32 - 4 = 28 flowers.\n\nHmm, now I have 28 flowers. But earlier I had 32. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think differently. If I consider that each side of the rectangle can have a certain number of flowers, depending on its length divided by the space per flower.\n\nFor the length sides: each length is 20 feet, and each flower needs 2 feet, so 20 / 2 = 10 flowers per length side.\n\nFor the width sides: each width is 12 feet, and each flower needs 2 feet, so 12 / 2 = 6 flowers per width side.\n\nNow, if I plant 10 flowers along one length side, 6 along one width side, 10 along the other length side, and 6 along the other width side, the corner flowers would be shared between the sides.\n\nSo, total flowers would be:\n\n10 (first length) + 6 (first width) + 10 (second length) + 6 (second width) = 32 flowers.\n\nBut again, the corner flowers are being counted twice. So, perhaps I need to subtract the 4 corner flowers.\n\nTherefore, 32 - 4 = 28 flowers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the perimeter as a continuous path, and flowers are placed every 2 feet along that path.\n\nSo, the perimeter is 64 feet, and flowers are placed every 2 feet.\n\nNumber of flowers = perimeter / space per flower = 64 / 2 = 32 flowers.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since the flowers are placed along a closed path, the first and last flowers would coincide at the starting point, so perhaps one flower is being double-counted.\n\nBut in reality, since it's a closed loop, the number should be 64 / 2 = 32 flowers.\n\nHowever, in my earlier approach, I got 28 flowers after accounting for double-counted corner flowers.\n\nI'm getting conflicting answers here. This is confusing.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nImagine starting at one corner and planting flowers every 2 feet along the perimeter.\n\nStarting at corner A (length side), plant a flower at 0 feet (corner A).\n\nThen at 2 feet along the length, another flower.\n\nAt 4 feet, another one, and so on, up to 20 feet.\n\nWait, 20 feet is the length, and flowers are every 2 feet.\n\nSo, number of flowers along one length side: 20 / 2 = 10 flowers.\n\nSimilarly, along the width: 12 / 2 = 6 flowers per width side.\n\nNow, if I add them up:\n\n2 lengths: 2 * 10 = 20 flowers\n\n2 widths: 2 * 6 = 12 flowers\n\nTotal: 20 + 12 = 32 flowers.\n\nBut, since the corners are shared, perhaps I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the corner flowers are already included in the count.\n\nLet me think about one side.\n\nFor example, along the 20-foot length, planting flowers every 2 feet:\n\nPositions: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n\nWait, that's 11 positions (including both ends).\n\nSimilarly, along the 12-foot width: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 -> 7 positions.\n\nBut, if I do that for both lengths and both widths:\n\nLength 1: 11 flowers\n\nWidth 1: 7 flowers\n\nLength 2: 11 flowers\n\nWidth 2: 7 flowers\n\nTotal: 11 + 7 + 11 + 7 = 36 flowers.\n\nBut, in this case, the corner flowers are being counted four times (once for each side they are on).\n\nWait, no. Each corner flower is shared between two sides, so it should be counted only once.\n\nSo, to avoid double-counting, I need to subtract the corner flowers.\n\nThere are four corners, so four corner flowers are being double-counted.\n\nTherefore, total flowers = 36 - 4 = 32 flowers.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 32 flowers from the perimeter division.\n\nAlternatively, considering that along each side, the number of flowers is equal to the length divided by the space per flower, plus one for the starting flower.\n\nWait, no. If I divide the length by the space, it gives me the number of intervals, but I need to add one more for the starting point.\n\nFor example, along the 20-foot length:\n\nNumber of intervals: 20 / 2 = 10\n\nNumber of flowers: 10 + 1 = 11\n\nSimilarly, along the 12-foot width:\n\nIntervals: 12 / 2 = 6\n\nFlowers: 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, for two lengths: 2 * 11 = 22 flowers\n\nFor two widths: 2 * 7 = 14 flowers\n\nTotal: 22 + 14 = 36 flowers.\n\nBut again, the corner flowers are being double-counted. Since each corner flower is shared between two sides, I need to subtract the four corner flowers that were double-counted.\n\nTherefore, total flowers = 36 - 4 = 32 flowers.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the perimeter as a closed path, the number of flowers should be equal to the perimeter divided by the space per flower.\n\nPerimeter = 64 feet\n\nSpace per flower = 2 feet\n\nNumber of flowers = 64 / 2 = 32 flowers.\n\nThis matches the previous result after adjusting for corner flowers.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of flowers that can be planted along the perimeter is 32.\n\nI think the initial approach of dividing the perimeter by the space per flower is the simplest and most accurate method in this case.\n\nSo, the answer should be 32 flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
