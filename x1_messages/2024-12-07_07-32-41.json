        "content": "J.R.R. Tolkien, the renowned author of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings,\" indeed had a connection to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Tolkien was a philologist and held various academic positions throughout his career. He worked as an assistant on the OED from 1918 to 1920, where he focused on the history and etymology of words beginning with the letter W. This experience contributed to his deep understanding of language and etymology, which is evident in his fictional works, particularly in the creation of elaborate languages for his invented worlds."
