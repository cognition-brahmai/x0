        "content": "Let's tackle this license plate problem step by step. So, the format is three letters followed by three numbers, right? And there are some specific rules: the first letter has to be either A or B, and no number can be repeated within the same plate. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's consider the letters. The license plate starts with three letters, and the first one has to be either A or B. That means there are 2 choices for the first letter. For the second and third letters, there are no restrictions mentioned, so I assume any letter from A to Z can be used. That's 26 possibilities for each of those positions.\n\nSo, for the letters part:\n\n- First letter: 2 choices (A or B)\n\n- Second letter: 26 choices (A-Z)\n\n- Third letter: 26 choices (A-Z)\n\nNow, for the numbers part: three numbers, and no number can be repeated within the same plate. Assuming these are digits from 0 to 9, that's 10 possible digits in total.\n\nFor the first number, there are 10 possible choices (0-9). Since no repetition is allowed, the second number will have 9 remaining choices (excluding the one already used), and the third number will have 8 choices (excluding the two already used).\n\nSo, for the numbers part:\n\n- First number: 10 choices (0-9)\n\n- Second number: 9 choices (excluding the first number)\n\n- Third number: 8 choices (excluding the first two numbers)\n\nNow, to find the total number of different license plates, we need to multiply the number of choices for each position together.\n\nTotal license plates = (choices for first letter) \u00d7 (choices for second letter) \u00d7 (choices for third letter) \u00d7 (choices for first number) \u00d7 (choices for second number) \u00d7 (choices for third number)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal license plates = 2 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8\n\nNow, let's calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the letter choices:\n\n2 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 26 = 2 \u00d7 676 = 1352\n\nThen, the number choices:\n\n10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 = 720\n\nNow, multiply these two results together:\n\n1352 \u00d7 720\n\nTo make this easier, let's break it down:\n\n1352 \u00d7 700 = 1352 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 100 = 9464 \u00d7 100 = 946,400\n\n1352 \u00d7 20 = 27,040\n\nNow, add these two results together:\n\n946,400 + 27,040 = 973,440\n\nSo, the total number of different license plates that can be created under these rules is 973,440.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's an easier way to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n- First letter: 2 choices (A or B)\n\n- Second letter: 26 choices\n\n- Third letter: 26 choices\n\n- First number: 10 choices (0-9)\n\n- Second number: 9 choices (excluding the first number)\n\n- Third number: 8 choices (excluding the first two numbers)\n\nSo, total combinations:\n\n2 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n\n52 \u00d7 26 = 1,352\n\n1,352 \u00d7 10 = 13,520\n\n13,520 \u00d7 9 = 121,680\n\n121,680 \u00d7 8 = 973,440\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to calculate the combinations for letters and numbers separately and then multiply them.\n\nLetters: 2 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 26 = 1,352\n\nNumbers: 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 = 720\n\nTotal: 1,352 \u00d7 720 = 973,440\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any restrictions I might have missed. The problem says \"no number can be repeated within the same plate,\" but it doesn't say anything about letters not repeating. So, letters can repeat, only numbers cannot repeat.\n\nAlso, it specifies that the first letter must be either A or B, which I've accounted for.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether letters are case-sensitive. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume they are not case-sensitive, meaning only uppercase letters are used, which is the standard for license plates.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the numbers are digits from 0 to 9, and the problem specifies that no number can be repeated within the same plate, which I've accounted for in the calculation.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different license plates possible is 973,440.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{973440} \\]"
