        "content": "So I've got this problem here. It says that in a group of people, 60% wear glasses, and 40% wear hats. Also, 20% wear both glasses and hats. I need to find out what percentage of people wear neither glasses nor hats.\n\nOkay, let me try to understand this. I think this is a problem about sets, specifically using something like a Venn diagram to visualize the groups.\n\nSo, first, 60% wear glasses. Let's call the set of people who wear glasses G. So, G = 60%.\n\nNext, 40% wear hats. Let's call that set H, so H = 40%.\n\nNow, 20% wear both glasses and hats. That's the intersection of G and H, right? So, G \u2229 H = 20%.\n\nI need to find the percentage of people who wear neither glasses nor hats. That should be the complement of the union of G and H, right? So, it's 100% minus the percentage who wear either glasses or hats or both.\n\nIn set notation, that's 100% - (G \u222a H).\n\nTo find G \u222a H, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That says that G \u222a H = G + H - G \u2229 H.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: G \u222a H = 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage who wear neither is 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 60% wear glasses and 40% wear hats, and 20% wear both, then the total percentage wearing either glasses or hats is 60% + 40% = 100%, but since 20% are counted in both groups, I need to subtract that overlap once to get the correct total.\n\nSo, 100% - 20% = 80%, and then 100% - 80% = 20%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of actual numbers. Suppose there are 100 people in the group.\n\n- 60 wear glasses.\n\n- 40 wear hats.\n\n- 20 wear both.\n\nSo, the number who wear only glasses is 60 - 20 = 40.\n\nThe number who wear only hats is 40 - 20 = 20.\n\nThe number who wear both is 20.\n\nSo, the total wearing either glasses or hats or both is 40 + 20 + 20 = 80.\n\nTherefore, the number wearing neither is 100 - 80 = 20, which is 20%.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem to confirm?\n\nMaybe using probabilities. If I consider wearing glasses and wearing hats as two events, then the probability of wearing glasses is P(G) = 60%, wearing hats is P(H) = 40%, and wearing both is P(G \u2229 H) = 20%.\n\nThe probability of wearing either glasses or hats or both is P(G \u222a H) = P(G) + P(H) - P(G \u2229 H) = 60% + 40% - 20% = 80%.\n\nThen, the probability of wearing neither is 1 - P(G \u222a H) = 1 - 80% = 20%.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
