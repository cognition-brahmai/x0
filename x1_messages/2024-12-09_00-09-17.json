        "content": "So, if someone saves $100 every month and earns an annual interest rate of 5%, how much will they have after 3 years? Let's figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how interest works in this scenario. Since the interest is annual, but the savings are monthly, I think I need to consider compound interest, where the interest is added to the principal amount over time, and future interest is earned on the accumulated amount.\n\nLet me recall the formula for compound interest with regular contributions. I think it's something like the future value of a series. The formula might be:\n\nFV = P * [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r]\n\nWhere:\n\n- FV is the future value of the investment\n\n- P is the monthly payment ($100 in this case)\n\n- r is the monthly interest rate\n\n- n is the total number of payments\n\nWait, but the interest rate given is annual, so I need to convert it to a monthly rate. Since there are 12 months in a year, I can divide the annual rate by 12.\n\nAnnual interest rate = 5%, so monthly interest rate = 5% / 12 = 0.05 / 12 \u2248 0.004167.\n\nNow, the number of payments over 3 years would be 3 years * 12 months/year = 36 months.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\nFV = 100 * [( (1 + 0.004167)^36 - 1 ) / 0.004167]\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.004167)^36.\n\n1 + 0.004167 = 1.004167\n\nRaise that to the 36th power: 1.004167^36 \u2248 1.161616\n\nNow, subtract 1: 1.161616 - 1 = 0.161616\n\nThen divide by the monthly rate: 0.161616 / 0.004167 \u2248 38.78\n\nFinally, multiply by the monthly payment: 100 * 38.78 = $3,878\n\nSo, after 3 years, the person would have approximately $3,878 saved, including interest.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting with the monthly interest rate: 5% annual divided by 12 is indeed about 0.4167%.\n\nThen, (1 + 0.004167)^36 should be calculated accurately.\n\nLet me use a calculator for this part.\n\n1.004167^36 \u2248 1.161616, which seems correct.\n\nThen, 1.161616 - 1 = 0.161616\n\nNext, 0.161616 / 0.004167 \u2248 38.78, which also seems right.\n\nFinally, 38.78 * 100 = $3,878\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently. Without interest, saving $100 every month for 3 years would be $100 * 36 = $3,600.\n\nWith interest at 5% annually, the additional amount should be the interest earned on the accumulated savings.\n\n$3,878 - $3,600 = $278 in interest, which seems reasonable for a 5% annual interest rate over 3 years.\n\nAlternatively, I can verify this using the future value of an annuity formula, which is designed for regular payments with compound interest.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nFV = P * [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r]\n\nWhere:\n\n- P is the payment amount ($100)\n\n- r is the interest rate per period (0.004167)\n\n- n is the number of periods (36)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFV = 100 * [( (1 + 0.004167)^36 - 1 ) / 0.004167]\n\n= 100 * [(1.161616 - 1) / 0.004167]\n\n= 100 * (0.161616 / 0.004167)\n\n= 100 * 38.78\n\n= $3,878\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, some banks might use different methods to calculate interest, like daily compounding or simple interest, but based on the information provided, I think compound interest with monthly contributions is the appropriate approach.\n\nSo, after 3 years, the total saved amount would be approximately $3,878.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3878} \\]"
