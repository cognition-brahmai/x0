        "content": "To prove that the sum of the angles in any triangle equals 180 degrees, we can use a method involving parallel lines and the properties of angles formed by a transversal. Here\u2019s a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Draw a Triangle and a Line Parallel to One Side:**\n   - Start by drawing any triangle, which we'll call triangle ABC, with angles A, B, and C.\n   - Draw a line through point A that is parallel to side BC. Let's call this line DE, where D is on AB and E is on AC extended if necessary.\n\n2. **Identify Corresponding Angles:**\n   - Since DE is parallel to BC and AB is a transversal, angle DAG (where G is the point where DE intersects AB) is equal to angle ABC (angle B). This is because they are corresponding angles.\n   - Similarly, since DE is parallel to BC and AC is a transversal, angle EAG (where G is the point where DE intersects AC) is equal to angle ACB (angle C). Again, these are corresponding angles.\n\n3. **Sum of Angles on a Straight Line:**\n   - Now, look at point A where the parallel lines and the transversals meet. The angles around point A on the straight line DE sum up to 180 degrees. Specifically, angle DAG, angle BAC (angle A), and angle EAG add up to 180 degrees.\n   - From step 2, we know that angle DAG = angle B and angle EAG = angle C.\n\n4. **Substitute and Conclude:**\n   - Therefore, angle B + angle A + angle C = 180 degrees.\n   - This shows that the sum of the interior angles of triangle ABC is 180 degrees.\n\nThis proof works for any triangle, regardless of its shape or size, because the properties of parallel lines and transversals are fundamental and universal in Euclidean geometry. Therefore, the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees."
