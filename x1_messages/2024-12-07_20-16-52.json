        "content": "To determine whether the function \\( h(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x \\) is increasing for \\( x > 3 \\), we need to analyze its first derivative. The first derivative of a function tells us about its rate of change or slope at any point. If the first derivative is positive for a certain interval, the function is increasing in that interval.\n\nLet's start by finding the first derivative of \\( h(x) \\).\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ h(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x \\]\n\nThe first derivative, \\( h'(x) \\), is:\n\n\\[ h'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) - \\frac{d}{dx}(6x^2) + \\frac{d}{dx}(9x) \\]\n\n\\[ h'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine where \\( h'(x) > 0 \\), specifically for \\( x > 3 \\).\n\nLet's consider \\( h'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9 \\).\n\nFirst, let's factor this quadratic expression to make it easier to analyze.\n\n\\[ h'(x) = 3(x^2 - 4x + 3) \\]\n\n\\[ h'(x) = 3(x - 1)(x - 3) \\]\n\nSo, \\( h'(x) = 3(x - 1)(x - 3) \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine the sign of \\( h'(x) \\) for \\( x > 3 \\).\n\nLet's consider the factors \\( (x - 1) \\) and \\( (x - 3) \\):\n\n- For \\( x > 3 \\):\n\n- \\( x - 1 > 2 \\) (since \\( x > 3 \\), \\( x - 1 > 2 \\))\n\n- \\( x - 3 > 0 \\)\n\nTherefore, both \\( (x - 1) \\) and \\( (x - 3) \\) are positive for \\( x > 3 \\).\n\nSince \\( h'(x) = 3(x - 1)(x - 3) \\), and 3 is positive, the product of three positive numbers is positive.\n\nTherefore, \\( h'(x) > 0 \\) for \\( x > 3 \\).\n\nThis means that \\( h(x) \\) is increasing for \\( x > 3 \\).\n\nTo confirm this, let's consider a test point in the interval \\( x > 3 \\). Let's choose \\( x = 4 \\).\n\nCompute \\( h'(4) \\):\n\n\\[ h'(4) = 3(4 - 1)(4 - 3) = 3(3)(1) = 9 \\]\n\nSince \\( h'(4) = 9 > 0 \\), this confirms that the function is increasing at \\( x = 4 \\), which is consistent with our earlier conclusion.\n\nAdditionally, to have a complete understanding, let's look at the behavior of \\( h(x) \\) for other values of \\( x \\):\n\n- For \\( x < 1 \\):\n\n- \\( x - 1 < 0 \\)\n\n- \\( x - 3 < 0 \\)\n\n- So, \\( h'(x) = 3(x - 1)(x - 3) \\): product of two negatives and one positive is positive.\n\n- Therefore, \\( h(x) \\) is increasing for \\( x < 1 \\).\n\n- For \\( 1 < x < 3 \\):\n\n- \\( x - 1 > 0 \\)\n\n- \\( x - 3 < 0 \\)\n\n- So, \\( h'(x) = 3(x - 1)(x - 3) \\): product of one positive and one negative is negative.\n\n- Therefore, \\( h(x) \\) is decreasing for \\( 1 < x < 3 \\).\n\n- For \\( x > 3 \\):\n\n- As previously determined, \\( h'(x) > 0 \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is increasing.\n\nThus, the function \\( h(x) \\) has the following behavior:\n\n- Increasing for \\( x < 1 \\)\n\n- Decreasing for \\( 1 < x < 3 \\)\n\n- Increasing for \\( x > 3 \\)\n\nThis analysis confirms that \\( h(x) \\) is indeed increasing for \\( x > 3 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The function } h(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x \\text{ is increasing for } x > 3.} \\]"
