        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bat and a ball that together cost $1.10. Additionally, the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. We need to find out how much the ball costs.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being asked. We have two items: a bat and a ball. Their combined cost is $1.10. Moreover, the bat is $1.00 more expensive than the ball. We need to find the cost of the ball.\n\nOkay, so let's assign variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the cost of the ball in dollars.\n\n- Since the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, the cost of the bat would be \\( b + 1.00 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the total cost of both items is $1.10. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ b + (b + 1.00) = 1.10 \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 2b + 1.00 = 1.10 \\]\n\nNext, we'll subtract 1.00 from both sides to isolate the terms with \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ 2b = 1.10 - 1.00 \\]\n\n\\[ 2b = 0.10 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{0.10}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ b = 0.05 \\]\n\nSo, the ball costs $0.05, which is 5 cents.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this because it seems a bit counterintuitive. If the ball costs $0.05, then the bat costs $1.00 more, which would be $1.05. Adding those together: $0.05 + $1.05 = $1.10. Yes, that checks out.\n\nI think the tricky part here is that when people hear \"the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball,\" they might mistakenly think that the bat is $1.00 and the ball is $0.10, but that would only make the bat $0.90 more expensive than the ball. So, the correct answer is that the ball costs 5 cents.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.05} \\]"
