        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 500 units of Product X every day, and each unit requires 3 hours of labor. So, total labor required per day is 500 units * 3 hours/unit = 1500 hours.\n\nThe factory operates 8 hours a day, and there are 125 workers. So, total labor provided by current workers is 125 workers * 8 hours/day = 1000 hours/day.\n\nThe production target requires 1500 hours of labor, but currently, only 1000 hours are being provided. So, the shortfall is 1500 - 1000 = 500 hours/day.\n\nTo meet this additional labor requirement, we need to hire more workers. Each additional worker can provide 8 hours of labor per day.\n\nSo, the number of additional workers needed is 500 hours/day \u00f7 8 hours/worker/day = 62.5 workers.\n\nSince we can't hire half a worker, we'll need to round up to 63 workers.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal labor required: 500 units * 3 hours/unit = 1500 hours/day.\n\nCurrent labor provided: 125 workers * 8 hours/day = 1000 hours/day.\n\nShortfall: 1500 - 1000 = 500 hours/day.\n\nAdditional workers needed: 500 \u00f7 8 = 62.5, which rounds up to 63 workers.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But maybe I should consider if all workers are working at full capacity.\n\nIf each worker works 8 hours a day, and the factory operates 8 hours a day, then yes, each worker can provide 8 hours of labor per day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the workers are not working at full efficiency, but based on the information provided, it seems that they are expected to work the full 8 hours.\n\nSo, I think 63 additional workers are needed to meet the production target.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{63} \\]"
