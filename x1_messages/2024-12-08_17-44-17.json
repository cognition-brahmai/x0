Each plan should correlate with an evidence value, which will be the outcome of one of the available functions when provided with an input string that could be the user question, prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nAvailable tools to use:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool allowing users to search for information via the DuckDuckGo search engine. Useful for locating potential sources that may contain the user's desired answer. The function does not directly deliver the answer but identifies possible sources.\nURLReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links. The input consists of one or more links, and the output is plain text containing the content of these links.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extracts hyperlinks from plain text and returns a plain text, newline-delimited list of links.\nELIZA[input]: An AI-based language model proficient at answering queries based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a textual question referring to an :evidence[n]: variable, such as What is the dog's breed, given :evidence1:?\n\nEach function requires a simple string as input, devoid of quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, like ELIZA[What is France's capital city, given :evidence3:?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nYour output should follow this structure:\nPlan: [First action to take based on the input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action to take, based on the result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, which may include references to prior evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was the director of the movie 'Inception' and what other movies have they directed?"
