        "content": "Alright, I need to create a Python script that can interact with an Amazon S3 bucket to perform operations like uploading, downloading, and listing files. The script should be able to accept command-line arguments to specify which action to take and any required parameters such as file paths and bucket names.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that I have the necessary libraries installed. For interacting with S3, I'll need the `boto3` library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. I can install it using pip if it's not already installed.\n\nI should also consider how to handle AWS credentials securely. boto3 can pick up credentials from environment variables, AWS config files, or IAM roles if running on an EC2 instance. For this script, I'll assume that the credentials are set up properly in the environment where the script is running.\n\nNext, I need to design the command-line interface. Since the script should accept different actions and parameters, using the `argparse` module would be appropriate. It allows me to define different arguments and options cleanly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Import necessary modules: `boto3`, `argparse`, and possibly others for file handling.\n\n2. Set up the argparse to handle different commands: upload, download, and list.\n\n3. For each command, define the necessary arguments:\n\n- Upload: bucket name and file path to upload.\n\n- Download: bucket name, file key to download, and local save path.\n\n- List: bucket name.\n\n4. Implement functions to perform each of these actions using boto3.\n\n5. Handle any exceptions that might occur during these operations.\n\nLet me start by setting up the basic structure of the script.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python script that interacts with an Amazon S3 bucket to upload, download, and list files, you can follow the steps below. This script uses the `boto3` library to interact with S3 and `argparse` for handling command-line arguments.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nimport argparse\nimport sys\n\ndef upload_file(bucket_name, file_path):\n    s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n    try:\n        filename = file_path.split('/')[-1]\n        s3.upload_file(file_path, bucket_name, filename)\n        print(f\"File {filename} uploaded to {bucket_name}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error uploading file: {e}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\ndef download_file(bucket_name, file_key, local_path):\n    s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n    try:\n        s3.download_file(bucket_name, file_key, local_path)\n        print(f\"File {file_key} downloaded from {bucket_name} to {local_path}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error downloading file: {e}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\ndef list_files(bucket_name):\n    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')\n    bucket = s3.Bucket(bucket_name)\n    try:\n        for file in bucket.objects.all():\n            print(file.key)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error listing files: {e}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"S3 Bucket File Manager\")\n    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest=\"command\", help=\"Commands\")\n\n    # Upload command\n    upload_parser = subparsers.add_parser(\"upload\", help=\"Upload a file to S3\")\n    upload_parser.add_argument(\"bucket\", help=\"Bucket name\")\n    upload_parser.add_argument(\"file\", help=\"File path to upload\")\n\n    # Download command\n    download_parser = subparsers.add_parser(\"download\", help=\"Download a file from S3\")\n    download_parser.add_argument(\"bucket\", help=\"Bucket name\")\n    download_parser.add_argument(\"key\", help=\"File key to download\")\n    download_parser.add_argument(\"local_path\", help=\"Local path to save the file\")\n\n    # List command\n    list_parser = subparsers.add_parser(\"list\", help=\"List files in S3 bucket\")\n    list_parser.add_argument(\"bucket\", help=\"Bucket name\")\n\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    if args.command == \"upload\":\n        upload_file(args.bucket, args.file)\n    elif args.command == \"download\":\n        download_file(args.bucket, args.key, args.local_path)\n    elif args.command == \"list\":\n        list_files(args.bucket)\n    else:\n        parser.print_help()\n        sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Imports**: \n   - `boto3` for interacting with AWS S3.\n   - `argparse` for parsing command-line arguments.\n   - `sys` for exiting the script with error codes.\n\n2. **Functions**:\n   - `upload_file(bucket_name, file_path)`: Uploads a file to the specified S3 bucket.\n   - `download_file(bucket_name, file_key, local_path)`: Downloads a file from the specified S3 bucket to a local path.\n   - `list_files(bucket_name)`: Lists all files in the specified S3 bucket.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - Sets up an argument parser with subparsers for different commands (upload, download, list).\n   - Parses the arguments and calls the appropriate function based on the command provided.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Each function handles exceptions and prints an error message if something goes wrong, then exits with status code 1.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward way to manage files in an S3 bucket via the command line, making it easy to integrate into scripts or use manually."
