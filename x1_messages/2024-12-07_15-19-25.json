        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling from Town A to Town B. It goes at 60 mph, stops for 20 minutes in Town C, which is halfway between A and B, and the whole journey takes 3 hours. I need to find the distance between Town A and Town B.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's happening step by step. The train leaves Town A, goes to Town C, stops for 20 minutes, and then goes from Town C to Town B. The total time for this is 3 hours.\n\nSince Town C is halfway between Town A and Town B, the distance from A to C is the same as from C to B. Let's call the distance from A to C \"d\". So, the total distance from A to B is 2d.\n\nThe train travels at 60 mph, so the time to go from A to C is d divided by 60, and the same for C to B: d/60 hours.\n\nNow, there's a 20-minute break in Town C. I need to make sure all units are consistent. Since the travel times are in hours, I should convert 20 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 20 minutes is 20/60 = 1/3 of an hour.\n\nThe total time for the journey is the time from A to C, plus the break, plus the time from C to B, which equals 3 hours.\n\nSo, in equation form:\n\n(time from A to C) + (break) + (time from C to B) = 3 hours\n\nThat is:\n\n(d/60) + (1/3) + (d/60) = 3\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n(2d)/60 + 1/3 = 3\n\nI can simplify 2d/60 to d/30:\n\nd/30 + 1/3 = 3\n\nNow, I need to solve for d.\n\nFirst, subtract 1/3 from both sides:\n\nd/30 = 3 - 1/3\n\n3 is the same as 9/3, so 9/3 - 1/3 = 8/3.\n\nSo:\n\nd/30 = 8/3\n\nNow, solve for d by multiplying both sides by 30:\n\nd = (8/3) * 30\n\nThat's:\n\nd = (8 * 30) / 3\n\nWhich is:\n\nd = 240 / 3\n\nd = 80 miles\n\nBut remember, d is the distance from A to C, which is half the distance from A to B. So, the total distance from A to B is 2d = 160 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf d is 80 miles, and the train goes at 60 mph, the time from A to C is 80/60 = 4/3 hours, which is 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, from C to B is another 80 miles at 60 mph, which is another 4/3 hours, or 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nThe break is 20 minutes.\n\nSo, total time:\n\n1 hour 20 minutes + 20 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes = 2 hours 60 minutes, which is 3 hours.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the distance between Town A and Town B is 160 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]"
