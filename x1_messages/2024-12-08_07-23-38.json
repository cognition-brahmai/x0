        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So total, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 balls in the bag. The question is, if I draw one ball at random, what's the probability that it's not red?\n\nOkay, probability. I remember that probability is just the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is 9, since there are 9 balls.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where the ball is not red. So, that would be the blue balls and the green balls. There are 3 blue and 2 green, so 3 + 2 = 5 balls that are not red.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 5/9. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the complement rule. I know that the probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of it happening. So, the probability that the ball is not red is 1 minus the probability that it is red.\n\nThe probability that it is red is 4/9, since there are 4 red balls out of 9 total. So, 1 - 4/9 = 5/9. Same answer as before.\n\nHmm, so both methods give me 5/9. That's good. It confirms that 5/9 is the correct probability.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other factor that could affect the probability here? For example, is the drawing of the ball random? The problem says it is, so that's fine.\n\nAlso, are the balls identical except for their color? I assume so, since it's a standard probability problem. So, no other characteristics are affecting the draw.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of permutations or combinations. But since I'm just drawing one ball, it's simply a matter of counting the number of favorable outcomes over the total outcomes.\n\nWait, another thought: what if the balls are not well-mixed, or something like that? But the problem says it's a bag, and we're drawing at random, so we assume that each ball has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\nSo, no, that shouldn't be a issue.\n\nLet me consider if there's any conditional probability here. But no, it's a single draw, so there's no conditioning involved.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The probability that the ball drawn is not red is indeed 5/9.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can simulate it. If I were to draw a ball from the bag many times, replacing it each time, I should get roughly 5/9 of the draws being non-red balls.\n\nFor example, if I draw 9 balls with replacement, I'd expect about 5 to be not red. That makes sense, since 5/9 is approximately 55.56%.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in percentages, 4/9 are red, which is about 44.44%, and 5/9 are not red, which is about 55.56%. So, it adds up to 100%.\n\nI feel confident with this answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{9}} \\]"
