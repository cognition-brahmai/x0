        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we know that the factory produces 500 units of product A each day, and each unit sells for $20. To find out the daily revenue, we'll multiply the number of units produced per day by the selling price per unit.\n\nSo, daily revenue = number of units per day \u00d7 selling price per unit\nThat would be 500 units/day \u00d7 $20/unit = $10,000/day\n\nNow, to find out the annual revenue, we need to know how many days the factory operates in a year. Since the question says it operates at full capacity every day, we can assume it runs 365 days a year.\n\nAnnual revenue = daily revenue \u00d7 number of days in a year\nSo, $10,000/day \u00d7 365 days/year = $3,650,000/year\n\nWait a minute, but some years are leap years with 366 days. However, the question doesn't specify whether it's a leap year or not. To be precise, we might consider that, but since it's not specified, I'll stick with 365 days.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other factor we should consider. Is there any information about production costs, overheads, or other expenses? The question only asks for revenue, which is the total income from sales before any expenses are deducted. So, we don't need to account for costs in this calculation.\n\nAlso, it's important to ensure that the factory is operating at full capacity every day, which is already stated in the problem. So, no need to worry about partial operation days.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any constraints or limitations that might affect production, but again, the question says it operates at full capacity every day, so we can assume that production is consistent throughout the year.\n\nLet me also confirm the units. We have units per day and days per year, which should give us units per year. Then, multiplying by the price per unit should give us the total revenue.\n\nSo, units per year = 500 units/day \u00d7 365 days/year = 182,500 units/year\n\nThen, revenue = 182,500 units/year \u00d7 $20/unit = $3,650,000/year\n\nYes, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any holidays or shutdown days that might affect the operation. But since the question specifies that it operates at full capacity every day, we can safely ignore any potential shutdowns.\n\nAdditionally, we should consider if there are any seasonal variations in demand or production, but again, the question doesn't provide any information suggesting that, so we'll assume constant production throughout the year.\n\nI think we've covered all the bases here. The factory produces 500 units per day, each selling for $20, and operates 365 days a year. Therefore, the annual revenue is $3,650,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3650000} \\]"
