        "content": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. So, we've got a car rental company with 100 cars, and they're renting them out at an average rate of $50 per day. The question is asking how much more money they would make if they increased their daily rental price by 10% and rented out all the cars for 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the current situation is. They have 100 cars, each being rented out at $50 per day. If they rent out all the cars for 30 days, how much do they make currently?\n\nSo, current daily revenue would be:\n\n100 cars * $50/car = $5000 per day\n\nFor 30 days, that would be:\n\n$5000/day * 30 days = $150,000\n\nNow, if they increase the daily rental price by 10%, what would be the new rental price?\n\n10% of $50 is:\n\n$50 * 0.10 = $5\n\nSo, new rental price would be:\n\n$50 + $5 = $55 per day per car\n\nIf they rent out all 100 cars at $55 per day for 30 days, what would be the new revenue?\n\nFirst, daily revenue at new price:\n\n100 cars * $55/car = $5500 per day\n\nFor 30 days:\n\n$5500/day * 30 days = $165,000\n\nNow, to find out how much more money they would make with the increased price, we subtract the original revenue from the new revenue:\n\n$165,000 - $150,000 = $15,000\n\nSo, by increasing the daily rental price by 10% and renting out all the cars for 30 days, they would make $15,000 more.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the increase in price per car per day, then multiply by the number of cars and the number of days.\n\nIncrease per car per day: $5\n\nNumber of cars: 100\n\nNumber of days: 30\n\nSo, total additional revenue:\n\n$5/car/day * 100 cars * 30 days = $15,000\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think that's straightforward. However, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. For example, if increasing the price might decrease the number of cars rented out, but the problem says they rent out all the cars, so presumably, the demand is there at the higher price.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies that they rent out all the cars for 30 days, so we don't have to worry about varying rental periods or partial rentals.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the rental is per day or for the entire 30 days, but the way it's phrased, it seems like the $50 is the daily rate, and they rent the cars out for 30 days.\n\nWait a minute, does \"rented out for 30 days\" mean that each car is rented out for 30 consecutive days, or that over a 30-day period, each car is rented out daily?\n\nI think it's the former, meaning that each rental period is 30 days, and they're charging $50 per day.\n\nSo, for a 30-day rental, each car would bring in:\n\n$50/day * 30 days = $1500 per car\n\nWith 100 cars, if they rent all of them out for 30 days, total revenue would be:\n\n100 cars * $1500/car = $150,000\n\nSimilarly, with the increased price:\n\nNew daily rate: $55\n\nTotal for 30 days per car: $55 * 30 = $1650 per car\n\nFor 100 cars: $1650/car * 100 cars = $165,000\n\nDifference: $165,000 - $150,000 = $15,000\n\nSo, regardless of how I look at it, the additional revenue is $15,000.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15000} \\]"
