        "content": "So, there are four friends who initially decided to split a $100 gift equally. That means each friend was supposed to pay $100 divided by 4, which is $25 each. But one friend can only contribute $20. So, they're short by $25 - $20 = $5.\n\nNow, this $5 shortfall needs to be covered by the other three friends. To find out how much more each of the three friends needs to pay, we divide the $5 by 3. So, $5 divided by 3 is approximately $1.67 per friend.\n\nTherefore, each of the other three friends needs to pay an additional $1.67 to cover the remaining cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.67} \\]"
