        "content": "So there are 7 red balls and 3 blue balls in a box, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacing the first one, both of them will be red.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to pick any two balls out of the ten. I think that's a combination problem, because the order doesn't matter when I'm just picking two balls.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 10 is C(10, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 possible pairs of balls.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of the 7 red balls.\n\nAgain, this is a combination problem: C(7, 2).\n\nCalculating C(7, 2):\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7 - 2)!) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5!)) = (7 \u00d7 6) / 2 = 21.\n\nSo, there are 21 ways to choose 2 red balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 21 / 45.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, and 45 \u00f7 3 = 15. So, it's 7/15.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this step by step, considering the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw and then another red ball on the second draw, without replacement.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is 7/10, since there are 7 red balls out of 10.\n\nThen, since I don't replace the first ball, there are now 6 red balls left out of a total of 9 balls.\n\nSo, the probability of picking another red ball is 6/9, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I multiply the probabilities: (7/10) \u00d7 (6/9) = (7/10) \u00d7 (2/3) = (7 \u00d7 2) / (10 \u00d7 3) = 14/30, which simplifies to 7/15.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 7/15.\n\nI think that makes sense. Just to be thorough, I'll check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach could be to use permutations instead of combinations, but since the order doesn't matter here, combinations are the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of ways to pick two red balls in a specific order, but then I'd have to account for both possible orders (red first then red second), but that seems more complicated than just using combinations.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if I use permutations, I'd be considering the order, so the total number of possible outcomes would be P(10, 2) = 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nAnd the number of favorable outcomes would be P(7, 2) = 7 \u00d7 6 = 42.\n\nThen, the probability would be 42 / 90, which simplifies to 7/15 again.\n\nSo, whether I use combinations or permutations, I end up with the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've confirmed that 7/15 is the correct probability that both balls picked will be red.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{15}} \\]\n"
