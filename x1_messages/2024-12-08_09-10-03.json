        "content": "I believe the novel you're referring to is \"Rebecca\" by Daphne du Maurier. In this classic gothic romance, Rebecca is the first wife of Maxim de Winter, who died under mysterious circumstances before the story begins. Although she is deceased and never physically present, her presence looms large over the estate of Manderley and the lives of the characters, particularly the second Mrs. de Winter, whose narrative voice drives the story. The novel explores themes of memory, identity, and the power of the past, with Rebecca's shadow casting a long and eerie influence throughout the book."
