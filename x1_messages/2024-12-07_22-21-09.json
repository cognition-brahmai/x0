So, about Albert Einstein winning the Nobel Prize...\n\nWell, from what I recall, Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his services to theoretical physics, particularly for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. But let me check the information you provided to make sure.\n\nYou mentioned that he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1931 for developing the periodic table. Hmm, that sounds a bit off because I know Einstein is primarily known for his work in physics, especially the theory of relativity and his famous equation E=mc\u00b2.\n\nLet me look up the Nobel Prize records to confirm. According to the official Nobel Prize website, Albert Einstein was indeed awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, but the reason given is \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" So, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the details you provided.\n\nMoreover, Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, not May 14, 1887. He was a physicist, not a chemist, and his work had profound impacts on physics, including the development of the general theory of relativity. His contributions to science are vast, but he is not credited with formulating the laws of thermodynamics or developing the periodic table.\n\nIt's possible there was some confusion in the information you're referring to. Maybe there's a mix-up with another scientist? For instance, Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her work with radioactivity, and Dmitri Mendeleev is known for creating the periodic table.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work on theoretical physics, particularly the photoelectric effect.\n\n- He was born on March 14, 1879.\n\n- He was a physicist, not a chemist.\n\n- His work primarily impacted physics, not biology.\n\n- He did not develop the periodic table.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Nobel Prize\u5b98\u65b9\u7db2\u7ad9: [Albert Einstein - Facts](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/einstein/facts/)"
