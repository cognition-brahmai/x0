        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class with a total of 25 students, and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2. We need to find out how many boys and girls there are.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. A ratio of 3:2 for boys to girls means that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. So, in total, there are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, if there are 25 students in the class, these 25 students are divided into these 5 parts. So, each part represents 25 \u00f7 5 = 5 students.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys would be 3 parts \u00d7 5 students per part = 15 boys.\n\nAnd the number of girls would be 2 parts \u00d7 5 students per part = 10 girls.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let me check if this adds up. 15 boys plus 10 girls equals 25 students, which matches the total given. Also, the ratio of 15:10 simplifies to 3:2, which matches the given ratio. So, this seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's try using algebra.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of boys as b and the number of girls as g.\n\nWe know that b + g = 25 (since there are 25 students in total).\n\nWe also know that the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2, which can be written as b/g = 3/2.\n\nFrom b/g = 3/2, we can cross-multiply to get 2b = 3g.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. b + g = 25\n\n2. 2b = 3g\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously.\n\nFrom the second equation, 2b = 3g, we can express b in terms of g: b = (3/2)g.\n\nSubstitute this into the first equation:\n\n(3/2)g + g = 25.\n\nTo combine these, let\u2019s get a common denominator:\n\n(3/2)g + (2/2)g = 25 \u2192 (5/2)g = 25.\n\nNow, solve for g: g = 25 \u00d7 (2/5) = 10.\n\nThen, b = (3/2) \u00d7 10 = 15.\n\nSo, again, we get 15 boys and 10 girls.\n\nThis matches our earlier result, which is a good sign.\n\nLet me think if there's another method. Maybe using proportions.\n\nThe ratio of boys to total students is 3/(3+2) = 3/5.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of girls to total students is 2/(3+2) = 2/5.\n\nSo, the number of boys is 3/5 of the total students: (3/5) \u00d7 25 = 15.\n\nThe number of girls is 2/5 of the total students: (2/5) \u00d7 25 = 10.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nSuppose we consider that the ratio 3:2 means that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls.\n\nSo, the difference in the number of boys and girls should be such that it maintains this proportion.\n\nLet\u2019s see, if we have 15 boys and 10 girls, the difference is 5, which is one part in the ratio (since 3 - 2 = 1 part).\n\nAnd indeed, each part represents 5 students, as we calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the ratio as parts, and the total parts are 5, then each part is 5 students.\n\nSo, boys are 3 parts \u00d7 5 = 15, and girls are 2 parts \u00d7 5 = 10.\n\nThis seems consistent across multiple methods, which reinforces that the answer is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there could be any other possible answers.\n\nSuppose someone thinks that the ratio 3:2 means 3 boys for every 2 boys, which would not make sense, because it should be boys to girls.\n\nOr, maybe misinterpret the total parts.\n\nBut in this case, since the total number of students is 25, which is divisible by 5, everything works out cleanly.\n\nIf the total number of students wasn't divisible by the sum of the parts in the ratio, then we might have fractional students, which isn't possible.\n\nBut here, it works out perfectly.\n\nSo, I think the best and most logical answer is that there are 15 boys and 10 girls in the class.\n\nThis answer is consistent across multiple methods: partitioning the total into parts based on the ratio, using algebraic equations, and using proportions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 15 boys and 10 girls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15 \\text{ boys and } 10 \\text{ girls}} \\]"
