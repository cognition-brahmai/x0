        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a square garden plot that's 20 feet on each side, and there's a flower border around the outside that covers an area equal to half the area of the garden. I need to figure out how wide that flower border is. Alright, let's start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nFirst, the garden is square with each side being 20 feet. So, the area of the garden is 20 feet times 20 feet, which is 400 square feet. The border of flowers around the outside covers an area that's half of that, so the area of the border is 200 square feet.\n\nNow, I need to find the width of this border. Let's visualize this. If there's a border around the garden, it's like adding some extra width all around the garden, right? So, if I let the width of the border be, say, \\( w \\) feet, then the total area including the garden and the border would be a larger square with sides of \\( 20 + 2w \\) feet. The reason it's \\( 20 + 2w \\) is because the border adds \\( w \\) feet to each side of the garden, so both sides together add \\( 2w \\) feet to the total length.\n\nSo, the area of the entire plot, including the garden and the border, would be \\( (20 + 2w)^2 \\) square feet.\n\nNow, the area of the border alone is the total area minus the area of the garden. So, that would be:\n\n\\[\n(20 + 2w)^2 - 400 = 200\n\\]\n\nBecause the border area is 200 square feet.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\n\\[\n(20 + 2w)^2 - 400 = 200\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for \\( w \\). Let's expand the left side:\n\n\\[\n(20 + 2w)^2 = 400 + 80w + 4w^2\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging that back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n400 + 80w + 4w^2 - 400 = 200\n\\]\n\nThe 400's cancel out, so:\n\n\\[\n80w + 4w^2 = 200\n\\]\n\nLet me rearrange this into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n4w^2 + 80w - 200 = 0\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by dividing all terms by 4:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 20w - 50 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: \\( w^2 + 20w - 50 = 0 \\). I can solve this using the quadratic formula, which is:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 20 \\), and \\( c = -50 \\). Plugging these values in:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{20^2 - 4(1)(-50)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 + 200}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{600}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-20 \\pm 10\\sqrt{6}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw = -10 \\pm 5\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, since width can't be negative, we'll take the positive value:\n\n\\[\nw = -10 + 5\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate the numerical value of that. First, \\( \\sqrt{6} \\) is approximately 2.449.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nw = -10 + 5(2.449) = -10 + 12.245 = 2.245\n\\]\n\nSo, the width of the border is approximately 2.245 feet.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if this makes sense. The area of the border is 200 square feet, and the garden is 400 square feet. If the border is about 2.245 feet wide, then the total area should be \\( (20 + 2(2.245))^2 = (20 + 4.49)^2 = 24.49^2 \\), which is approximately 600 square feet. Subtracting the garden area, 600 - 400 = 200 square feet, which matches the border area. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe to verify the answer.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nInstead of considering the total area including the border, perhaps I can think about the border as a frame around the garden.\n\nThe garden is 20 feet by 20 feet, and the border is of uniform width \\( w \\) around it.\n\nSo, the border consists of four rectangles: two that are 20 feet long and \\( w \\) feet wide, and two that are \\( w \\) feet wide and \\( 20 + 2w \\) feet long, but actually, no, wait.\n\nActually, the border forms a strip around the garden. To find its area, I can think of it as the area between two squares: the outer square of side \\( 20 + 2w \\) and the inner square of side 20.\n\nSo, the area of the border is:\n\n\\[\n(20 + 2w)^2 - 20^2 = 200\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same equation I had before, leading to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approximate the width.\n\nIf the border is 2 feet wide, then the total side length would be 20 + 2*2 = 24 feet, and the total area would be 576 square feet. Subtracting the garden area, 576 - 400 = 176 square feet, which is less than 200.\n\nIf the border is 2.5 feet wide, then the total side length is 20 + 2*2.5 = 25 feet, and the area is 625 square feet. Subtracting the garden area, 625 - 400 = 225 square feet, which is more than 200.\n\nSo, the width must be between 2 and 2.5 feet, which matches my earlier calculation of approximately 2.245 feet.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to set up the equation differently.\n\nLet me denote the width of the border as \\( w \\).\n\nThe area of the border is the area of the outer square minus the area of the inner square:\n\n\\[\n(20 + 2w)^2 - 20^2 = 200\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n400 + 80w + 4w^2 - 400 = 200\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n80w + 4w^2 = 200\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\n20w + w^2 = 50\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\nw^2 + 20w - 50 = 0\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same quadratic equation as before.\n\nSolving it gives the same result: \\( w = -10 + 5\\sqrt{6} \\), which is approximately 2.245 feet.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider units. The width is in feet, and the area is in square feet. My calculations seem consistent in terms of units.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the width is positive, which it is in the context of the problem.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem, perhaps using perimeter or something else?\n\nWell, the perimeter of the garden is 80 feet, but I'm not sure if that directly helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the border as consisting of four rectangles: two with dimensions 20 feet by \\( w \\), and two with dimensions \\( 20 + 2w \\) by \\( w \\), but that seems more complicated than the initial approach.\n\nLet me try that to see.\n\nTwo rectangles of 20 by \\( w \\), and two rectangles of \\( 20 + 2w \\) by \\( w \\)? Wait, no, that's not accurate.\n\nActually, the border consists of two pairs of rectangles: two rectangles that are 20 feet by \\( w \\), and two rectangles that are \\( w \\) by \\( 20 + 2w \\), but that seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the area of the border as the sum of the areas of the four sides.\n\nEach side would have an area of \\( 20 \\times w \\) for the lengthwise borders, and \\( w \\times w \\) for the corner sections.\n\nWait, that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nI think the initial approach of subtracting the areas is the most straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's a geometric interpretation or a formula that could simplify this.\n\nIn general, for a square with side length \\( s \\), and a border of width \\( w \\), the area of the border is \\( (s + 2w)^2 - s^2 \\).\n\nExpanding that:\n\n\\[\n(s + 2w)^2 - s^2 = s^2 + 4sw + 4w^2 - s^2 = 4sw + 4w^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the area of the border is \\( 4w(s + w) \\).\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me verify that.\n\nStarting with \\( (s + 2w)^2 - s^2 = 4sw + 4w^2 \\), which factors to \\( 4w(s + w) \\).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in this case, \\( s = 20 \\) feet, and the area of the border is \\( 4w(20 + w) = 200 \\) square feet.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n4w(20 + w) = 200\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n80w + 4w^2 = 200\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nSo, again, solving for \\( w \\) gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the width of the flower border is approximately 2.245 feet.\n\nAlternatively, to express it in exact form, it's \\( -10 + 5\\sqrt{6} \\) feet.\n\nBut since width can't be negative, we disregard the negative solution.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\( w = -10 + 5\\sqrt{6} \\) feet.\n\nIf needed, this can be approximated to a decimal, but the exact form is preferable.\n\nLet me box the final answer.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{w = -10 + 5\\sqrt{6} \\text{ feet}} \\]"
