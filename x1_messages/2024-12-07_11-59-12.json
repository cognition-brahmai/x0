        "content": "Let's see. So, we have two trains: one leaving Town A heading to Town B, and another leaving Town B heading to Town A at the same time. Their combined speed is 90 mph, and the distance between the towns is 180 miles. I need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"combined speed\" means in this context. If both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, if one train is going at a certain speed and the other at another speed, their combined speed would be the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"their combined speed is 90 mph.\" Does that mean the sum of their speeds is 90 mph? I think so.\n\nOkay, so the combined speed is 90 mph, and the distance between the towns is 180 miles. I need to find the time it takes for them to meet.\n\nI recall that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time = distance / speed.\n\nIn this case, the distance is 180 miles, and the speed is their combined speed, which is 90 mph.\n\nSo, time = 180 miles / 90 mph = 2 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should consider the speeds of individual trains.\n\nThe first train travels from Town A to Town B in 3 hours, and the distance is 180 miles. So, its speed is 180 miles / 3 hours = 60 mph.\n\nNow, if the combined speed of both trains is 90 mph, and one train is going at 60 mph, then the other train must be going at 90 mph - 60 mph = 30 mph.\n\nWait, but does that make sense? If one train is going at 60 mph and the other at 30 mph towards each other, their combined speed is indeed 90 mph.\n\nSo, yes, the time it takes for them to meet should be the distance divided by their combined speed, which is 180 miles / 90 mph = 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the relative speed. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 90 mph, as given.\n\nSo, again, time = distance / relative speed = 180 miles / 90 mph = 2 hours.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the speed of the first train as v1 and the second train as v2.\n\nWe know that v1 + v2 = 90 mph.\n\nWe also know that the first train travels 180 miles in 3 hours, so v1 = 180 miles / 3 hours = 60 mph.\n\nTherefore, v2 = 90 mph - 60 mph = 30 mph.\n\nNow, when both trains are moving towards each other, the distance between them decreases at a rate of v1 + v2 = 90 mph.\n\nSo, the time it takes for them to meet is the initial distance divided by the rate at which the distance is decreasing, which is 180 miles / 90 mph = 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the distance each train covers.\n\nIn time t, the first train covers a distance of v1 * t = 60t miles.\n\nIn the same time t, the second train covers v2 * t = 30t miles.\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of the distances they've covered should be equal to the initial distance between the towns, which is 180 miles.\n\nSo, 60t + 30t = 180.\n\nCombining like terms, 90t = 180.\n\nSolving for t, t = 180 / 90 = 2 hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me try one more way to confirm.\n\nLet's use the concept of relative motion.\n\nIf I consider the first train as stationary, then the second train is approaching it at the combined speed of both, which is 90 mph.\n\nSo, the second train is covering the 180 miles at 90 mph, which again gives t = 180 / 90 = 2 hours.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same conclusion: it will take 2 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nI think I've confirmed this sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
