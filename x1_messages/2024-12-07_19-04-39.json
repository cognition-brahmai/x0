        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular garden. The original dimensions are 15 meters in length and 10 meters in width. The owner wants to increase the area by 50% but only by extending the length. I need to figure out what the new length should be.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out what the current area of the garden is. For a rectangle, area is calculated by multiplying length by width, right? So, original area = length \u00d7 width = 15 m \u00d7 10 m = 150 square meters.\n\nNow, the owner wants to increase this area by 50%. So, the increase in area would be 50% of 150 square meters. Let me calculate that: 50% of 150 is (50/100) \u00d7 150 = 75 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the new area should be the original area plus the increase: 150 m\u00b2 + 75 m\u00b2 = 225 m\u00b2.\n\nThe tricky part is that only the length is being increased, while the width stays the same at 10 meters. So, the new area is going to be new length \u00d7 original width.\n\nLet me denote the new length as L. So, L \u00d7 10 m = 225 m\u00b2.\n\nTo find L, I can rearrange that equation: L = 225 m\u00b2 / 10 m = 22.5 meters.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nOriginal area: 15 m \u00d7 10 m = 150 m\u00b2.\n\nDesired increase: 50% of 150 m\u00b2 = 75 m\u00b2.\n\nNew area: 150 m\u00b2 + 75 m\u00b2 = 225 m\u00b2.\n\nWith width remains 10 m, new length L = 225 m\u00b2 / 10 m = 22.5 m.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Alternatively, I could think of it as the area is being increased by 50% only by making the length longer, so the ratio of areas should relate to the ratio of lengths, since width is constant.\n\nWait, but actually, since width is staying the same, the ratio of new area to old area should be equal to the ratio of new length to old length.\n\nLet me see: new area / old area = new length / old length.\n\nSo, 225 m\u00b2 / 150 m\u00b2 = L / 15 m.\n\nSimplifying 225/150 = 1.5, so 1.5 = L / 15 m.\n\nTherefore, L = 1.5 \u00d7 15 m = 22.5 m.\n\nAgain, the same answer. That gives me more confidence.\n\nAnother way to think about it: increasing the area by 50% while keeping the width the same means you're only changing the length by the same percentage.\n\nSo, if the original area is 150 m\u00b2, and you want to increase it by 50%, that's multiplying the area by 1.5.\n\nSince width remains the same, the length must be multiplied by 1.5 to achieve that.\n\nSo, new length = 1.5 \u00d7 original length = 1.5 \u00d7 15 m = 22.5 m.\n\nAll these approaches lead to the same conclusion: the new length should be 22.5 meters.\n\nLet me just make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Is there anything else I should think about here?\n\nThe problem says \"only increasing the length,\" so I don't need to worry about changing the width.\n\nAlso, all measurements are in meters, so units are consistent.\n\nI think that's all there is to it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{22.5 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
