        "content": "The U.S. President known as the \"Trust Buster\" is Theodore Roosevelt. During his presidency from 1901 to 1909, Roosevelt took significant actions to address the issue of large corporate monopolies, which were referred to as \"trusts.\" He believed that these trusts had too much power and were stifling competition, which was detrimental to the economy and consumers.\n\nRoosevelt used the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 as a tool to break up these industrial combinations. The Sherman Act was the first federal law to prohibit monopolistic business practices and trusts. However, it had not been enforced rigorously before Roosevelt's administration.\n\nOne of the most notable cases during Roosevelt's presidency was the dissolution of the Northern Securities Company, which was a railroad holding company formed by J.P. Morgan and other industrialists to control transportation in the Northwest. Roosevelt ordered the Justice Department to sue Northern Securities under the Sherman Act, and in 1904, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government, breaking up the company.\n\nRoosevelt's approach to trusts was often referred to as the \"Square Deal,\" which aimed to balance the interests of consumers, workers, and business owners. He believed in regulating big business to ensure fair competition and protect the public interest.\n\nIt's worth noting that Roosevelt's successor, William Howard Taft, continued the trust-busting efforts, but with a more legalistic approach. However, it was Roosevelt's aggressive stance and active use of the Sherman Act that earned him the nickname \"Trust Buster.\"\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Sherman Antitrust Act:** Passed in 1890, this act was the first federal act to prohibit monopolistic business practices and trusts. It made it illegal to restrain trade or commerce among the states or with foreign nations.\n\n- **Progressive Era:** Roosevelt's trust-busting activities were part of the broader Progressive Movement in the early 20th century, which aimed to address social and economic issues through government intervention and reform.\n\n- **Other Notable Actions:** Besides the Northern Securities case, Roosevelt also took action against other trusts, including those in the beef, oil, and tobacco industries.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- \"Theodore Roosevelt: A Bully Presidency\" by H.W. Brands\n\n- \"The Square Deal: The Political Philosophy of Theodore Roosevelt\" by Richard Jensen\n\n- Official records from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Supreme Court\n\n**Note:** While I've provided a detailed answer based on historical records, it's always a good idea to cross-reference information from multiple sources to get a comprehensive understanding of historical events and figures."
