        "content": "So, the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, and each one has a 5% chance of being defective. I need to find out, on average, how many defective widgets are made each day.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"5% chance of being defective\" means. It means that for each widget, there's a 5 in 100 chance that it's not up to standard. So, out of every 100 widgets, approximately 5 might be defective.\n\nBut since the factory makes 1000 widgets, which is ten times more than 100, maybe I can just multiply 5 defective widgets by 10. That would give me 50 defective widgets per day.\n\nWait, but is that the right way to think about it? I remember that in probability, the expected value is what we should be looking at here. The expected value is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents.\n\nSo, for each widget, the probability of being defective is 0.05. The expected number of defective widgets per widget is 0.05.\n\nSince there are 1000 widgets, the total expected number of defective widgets is 1000 times 0.05.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1000 multiplied by 0.05 is 50.\n\nSo, on average, 50 widgets will be defective each day.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should consider another approach. Perhaps using the binomial distribution, since each widget can be defective or not, and the probability is independent for each widget.\n\nIn a binomial distribution, the expected value is n times p, where n is the number of trials, and p is the probability of success in each trial. Here, \"success\" is a widget being defective, which is kind of morbid, but okay.\n\nSo, n = 1000, p = 0.05, expected defective widgets = n*p = 1000*0.05 = 50.\n\nAlright, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. If 5% of widgets are defective, then the proportion of defective widgets is 0.05. Applied to 1000 widgets, that's 0.05*1000 = 50.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result. On average, the factory will produce 50 defective widgets per day.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I should account for. Is the probability of being defective independent for each widget? I assume so, unless there's some common factor that could cause multiple widgets to be defective at the same time.\n\nFor example, if there's a problem with the machinery, it might affect multiple widgets. But based on the information given, each widget has a\u72ec\u7acb\u76845% chance of being defective, so I think the binomial model is appropriate here.\n\nAlso, the question says \"on average,\" which aligns with the concept of expected value in probability.\n\nSo, I don't think I need to consider any additional complexities. The answer should be 50 defective widgets per day on average.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can calculate the variance as well, to understand how much the number of defective widgets might vary from the average.\n\nIn a binomial distribution, the variance is n*p*(1-p). So, variance = 1000 * 0.05 * 0.95 = 1000 * 0.0475 = 47.5.\n\nThe standard deviation would be the square root of the variance, which is approximately 6.89.\n\nThis tells me that while the average number of defective widgets is 50, the number can vary by about 7 widgets on either side due to randomness.\n\nBut since the question only asks for the average number, I don't need to go into the variation.\n\nIn conclusion, the factory can expect to produce, on average, 50 defective widgets per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
