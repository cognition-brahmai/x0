Then Sally asks for an apple, but Mary doesn't have any apples mentioned, only cookies. And the question is about how many grapes Mary has left, but again, there's no mention of grapes earlier. This seems a bit confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the question?\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Mary has 15 cookies.\n\nThen, she gives 3 cookies to John.\n\nSo, cookies left with Mary: 15 - 3 = 12 cookies.\n\nNext, Sally asks Mary for an apple.\n\nBut, there's no information about Mary having any apples. Maybe Sally is just asking, and Mary doesn't have any to give.\n\nFinally, the question is about how many grapes Mary has left.\n\nWait a minute, where did grapes come from? There was no mention of grapes before.\n\nIt seems like there might be some confusion or mixing up of items in this problem.\n\nPerhaps the question is supposed to be about cookies, apples, and grapes, but it's not clearly stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and the answer is supposed to be that Mary has no grapes because they were never mentioned earlier.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing attention to detail, to see if the reader notices that grapes were not introduced in the scenario.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be that the number of grapes Mary has left is unknown or zero, depending on the assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo, and the question is supposed to be about cookies or another fruit.\n\nGiven the information provided, since there's no mention of grapes at all in the initial setup, I would conclude that Mary has zero grapes.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's the intended answer.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the question is flawed or incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's more context that's not being provided here.\n\nIn any case, based on the information given, Mary has zero grapes, since nothing suggests she has any grapes to begin with.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
