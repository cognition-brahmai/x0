        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to write an SQL query that fetches employees hired in the last year, grouped by their department. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the table where employee data is stored. The prompt mentions a database with employees having fields like EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate, and Department. So, presumably, there's a table named something like \"Employees\" or \"EmployeeTable\". For this example, I'll assume it's called \"Employees\".\n\nNext, I need to select all employees who were hired in the last year. To do this, I'll need to compare the HireDate with the current date. In SQL, functions like CURRENT_DATE can be used to get the current date. Then, I can subtract one year from the current date to get the date exactly one year ago.\n\nAfter that, I need to filter the employees whose HireDate is after that date, meaning they were hired within the last year.\n\nFinally, I need to sort the results by department. This should be straightforward by ordering the results based on the Department field.\n\nLet me think about the SQL syntax for this.\n\nFirst, the SELECT statement will list all columns I want to retrieve. Since the prompt says \"all employees,\" I assume I need all columns. So, I can use SELECT * from Employees.\n\nThen, I need to add a WHERE clause to filter employees hired in the last year. The condition will be HireDate > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'.\n\nWait, but SQL dialects can differ in how they handle date operations. In standard SQL, you can use DATE_SUB or similar functions. For example, in MySQL, it's DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 YEAR).\n\nBut to make it more general, I'll use the SQL:2008 standard function DATEADD, which is supported in many databases.\n\nSo, the condition would be HireDate > DATEADD(YEAR, -1, CURRENT_DATE)\n\nThen, I need to order the results by Department. So, ORDER BY Department.\n\nLet me put this all together.\n\nSELECT *\n\nFROM Employees\n\nWHERE HireDate > DATEADD(YEAR, -1, CURRENT_DATE)\n\nORDER BY Department;\n\nHmm, I should consider if HireDate can be NULL. Maybe I should add a condition to handle NULL values, but the prompt doesn't mention any NULL dates, so I'll proceed without it for now.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the date functions are used correctly according to the specific database system being used. Since the prompt doesn't specify the database system, I'll stick with a general SQL syntax.\n\nLet me check if there's a better way to calculate the date one year ago. Some databases might have different functions for date manipulation.\n\nFor example, in PostgreSQL, I can use CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'.\n\nIn SQL Server, I can use DATEADD(year, -1, CURRENT_DATE).\n\nIn MySQL, also DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 YEAR).\n\nTo keep it standardized, I'll stick with the DATEADD function.\n\nWait, actually, DATEADD is not part of the SQL:2008 standard. The standard way is to use INTERVAL with subtraction.\n\nSo, a more standard way would be:\n\nSELECT *\n\nFROM Employees\n\nWHERE HireDate > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1' YEAR\n\nORDER BY Department;\n\nThis should work in databases like PostgreSQL and SQL Server.\n\nBut to ensure compatibility, I might need to adjust the syntax based on the actual database system.\n\nSince the prompt doesn't specify the database system, I'll go with this standardized approach.\n\nLet me write it down clearly.\n\nSELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate, Department\n\nFROM Employees\n\nWHERE HireDate > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1' YEAR\n\nORDER BY Department;\n\nWait, the prompt says \"all employees who were hired in the last year,\" so SELECT * is fine, but for clarity, I listed all columns explicitly.\n\nBut to follow the prompt exactly, SELECT * is sufficient.\n\nSo, the final query is:\n\nSELECT *\n\nFROM Employees\n\nWHERE HireDate > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1' YEAR\n\nORDER BY Department;\n\nI think that should do it.\n\n**Final Query:**\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\n\nFROM Employees\n\nWHERE HireDate > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1' YEAR\n\nORDER BY Department;\n```\n\n"
