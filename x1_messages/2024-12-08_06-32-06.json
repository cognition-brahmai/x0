        "content": "Yes, many immigrants had their last names Americanized or changed upon arrival at Ellis Island. This was often done by immigration officials who would anglicize or shorten difficult-to-pronounce names to make them more manageable for record-keeping purposes. For example, a name like \"Schmidt\" might be changed to \"Smith,\" or \"Kowalski\" to \"Coleman.\" This practice was common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when millions of immigrants passed through Ellis Island. It's important to note that while some immigrants embraced these changes, others may have preferred to keep their original names but were unable to do so due to the practices of the time."
