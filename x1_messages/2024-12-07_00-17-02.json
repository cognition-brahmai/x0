        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you write a Python script that does three main things: connects to Azure Blob Storage, uploads a local file, and lists all the files in a specific container. Sound good?\n\nFirst, make sure you have the Azure Blob Storage client library for Python. You can install it using pip if you haven't already. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:\n\n```bash\npip install azure-storage-blob\n```\n\nOkay, now let's start writing the script. We'll need a few things from the Azure SDK, so import them at the beginning of your script:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, BlobClient, ContainerClient\n```\n\nNext, you'll need your connection string to connect to your Azure Blob Storage account. You can find this in your Azure portal under the storage account settings. For security, it's better to store this in an environment variable or a config file, but for simplicity, we'll hardcode it here. Make sure to replace `your_connection_string` with your actual connection string.\n\n```python\nconnection_string = \"your_connection_string\"\n```\n\nNow, let's create an instance of the `BlobServiceClient` using this connection string.\n\n```python\nblob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)\n```\n\nAssuming you already have a container created, specify its name. If not, you can create one programmatically. For now, let's just set the container name.\n\n```python\ncontainer_name = \"your_container_name\"\n```\n\nTo upload a local file, you'll need the local file path and the name you want to give it in the cloud. Let's say your local file is `local_file.txt` and you want to name it the same in the cloud.\n\n```python\nlocal_file_path = \"local_file.txt\"\nblob_name = \"local_file.txt\"\n```\n\nNow, get a reference to the container and upload the blob.\n\n```python\ncontainer_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container_name)\n\nwith open(local_file_path, \"rb\") as data:\n    container_client.upload_blob(blob_name, data)\n```\n\nThis code opens the local file in binary read mode and uploads it to the specified container with the given blob name.\n\nNext, to list all the files (blobs) in the container, you can iterate over the blobs in the container.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Listing blobs in the container:\")\nblobs_list = container_client.list_blobs()\nfor blob in blobs_list:\n    print(\"\\t\", blob.name)\n```\n\nThis will print the names of all the blobs in the specified container.\n\nPutting it all together, your script should look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, BlobClient, ContainerClient\n\n# Connection string (replace with your actual connection string)\nconnection_string = \"your_connection_string\"\n\n# Create a BlobServiceClient instance\nblob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)\n\n# Name of the container\ncontainer_name = \"your_container_name\"\n\n# Get a client to interact with the container\ncontainer_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container_name)\n\n# Local file path and blob name\nlocal_file_path = \"local_file.txt\"\nblob_name = \"local_file.txt\"\n\n# Upload the blob\nwith open(local_file_path, \"rb\") as data:\n    container_client.upload_blob(blob_name, data)\n\n# List all blobs in the container\nprint(\"Listing blobs in the container:\")\nblobs_list = container_client.list_blobs()\nfor blob in blobs_list:\n    print(\"\\t\", blob.name)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"your_connection_string\"` and `\"your_container_name\"` with your actual connection string and container name.\n\nAlso, ensure that the file `local_file.txt` exists in the same directory as your script, or provide the correct path to the file.\n\nThis script connects to your Azure Blob Storage, uploads a specified local file to the specified container, and then lists all the files in that container.
