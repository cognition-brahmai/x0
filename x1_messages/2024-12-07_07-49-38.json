        "content": "Let's see. So, in this town, every house has either a red or blue door, and there are twice as many houses with red doors as there are with blue doors. I need to find out what percentage of the houses have blue doors.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to the number of houses with each color door. Let's say the number of houses with blue doors is B, and the number of houses with red doors is R.\n\nAccording to the problem, there are twice as many houses with red doors as there are with blue doors. So, R = 2B.\n\nNow, the total number of houses in the town is the sum of houses with red doors and houses with blue doors, which is R + B.\n\nSince R = 2B, I can substitute that into the total: Total houses = 2B + B = 3B.\n\nI need to find the percentage of houses that have blue doors. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of houses with blue doors by the total number of houses, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, percentage of blue doors = (B / (3B)) * 100.\n\nHmm, B cancels out in the fraction: B / 3B = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the percentage is (1/3) * 100, which is approximately 33.33%.\n\nWait, but is there a way to confirm this? Maybe I can think of it with actual numbers.\n\nSuppose there are 10 houses with blue doors. Then, according to the problem, there would be twice as many with red doors, so 20 houses with red doors.\n\nTotal houses = 10 (blue) + 20 (red) = 30 houses.\n\nPercentage of blue doors = (10 / 30) * 100 = 33.33%.\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if there are 5 houses with blue doors, then there would be 10 with red doors, total 15 houses.\n\nPercentage of blue doors = (5 / 15) * 100 = 33.33%.\n\nAgain, the same percentage.\n\nSo, no matter what number I choose for B, as long as R is twice B, the percentage remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of houses with blue doors is 33.33%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33.\\overline{3}\\%} \\]"
