        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 6 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls. So, in total, there are 6 + 4 + 5 = 15 balls in the bag. The problem is asking for the probability that if I pick two balls at once without replacement, one is red and the other is blue.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what it means to pick two balls at once without replacement. I think this is similar to picking two balls randomly from the bag without putting any back. So, the order doesn't matter here; it's combinations we're dealing with, not permutations.\n\nNow, to find the probability of picking one red and one blue ball, I can think of it as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to pick any two balls from the 15 balls. That's the combination of 15 balls taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to pick 2 balls from 15 is C(15, 2). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(15, 2) = 15! / (2!(15 - 2)!) = (15 \u00d7 14) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 105.\n\nSo, there are 105 possible pairs of balls that can be picked.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is picking one red and one blue ball.\n\nThere are 6 red balls and 4 blue balls. So, the number of ways to pick one red and one blue is the product of the number of red balls and the number of blue balls, because for each red ball, there are 4 blue balls that can be paired with it.\n\nSo, number of favorable outcomes = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 24 / 105.\n\nBut, I can simplify that fraction. Both 24 and 105 are divisible by 3.\n\n24 \u00f7 3 = 8\n\n105 \u00f7 3 = 35\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 8/35.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use probabilities step by step. So, the probability of picking a red ball first is 6/15, and then picking a blue ball next is 4/14, since one ball has already been picked.\n\nSo, that would be (6/15) \u00d7 (4/14) = (2/5) \u00d7 (2/7) = 4/35.\n\nBut, that's only if you pick the red ball first. You could also pick the blue ball first and then the red ball.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a blue ball first is 4/15, and then picking a red ball is 6/14.\n\nSo, that's (4/15) \u00d7 (6/14) = (4/15) \u00d7 (3/7) = 12/105, which simplifies to 4/35.\n\nThen, the total probability is the sum of these two scenarios: red first and blue second, plus blue first and red second.\n\nSo, 4/35 + 4/35 = 8/35.\n\nWait, that matches my earlier calculation. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. We can use combinations for both parts.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one red and one blue is C(6,1) \u00d7 C(4,1) = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any two balls is C(15,2) = 105.\n\nSo, probability is 24/105 = 8/35.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of probability of selecting one red and one blue without regard to order.\n\nThe formula for the probability of selecting one item from one group and another item from another group when picking without replacement is given by:\n\nP = [C(a,1) \u00d7 C(b,1)] / C(t,2)\n\nWhere a is the number of items in the first group, b is the number in the second group, and t is the total number of items.\n\nIn this case, a = 6 (red), b = 4 (blue), t = 15.\n\nSo, P = [C(6,1) \u00d7 C(4,1)] / C(15,2) = (6 \u00d7 4) / 105 = 24/105 = 8/35.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider the decimal equivalent.\n\n8/35 is approximately 0.2286, or 22.86%.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nWell, there are 15 balls, and we're picking two. The chance of getting one red and one blue should be somewhat significant since there are 6 red and 4 blue, totaling 10 out of 15 balls that are either red or blue.\n\nBut wait, no. There are 5 green balls as well. So, total balls are 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of percentages.\n\nTotal pairs: 105.\n\nFavorable pairs: 24.\n\nSo, 24 out of 105 is indeed approximately 22.86%.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the probability step by step.\n\nProbability of first ball being red: 6/15 = 0.4.\n\nThen, probability of second ball being blue given the first was red: 4/14 \u2248 0.2857.\n\nSo, 0.4 \u00d7 0.2857 \u2248 0.1143.\n\nThen, probability of first ball being blue: 4/15 \u2248 0.2667.\n\nProbability of second ball being red given the first was blue: 6/14 \u2248 0.4286.\n\nSo, 0.2667 \u00d7 0.4286 \u2248 0.1143.\n\nTotal probability: 0.1143 + 0.1143 = 0.2286, which matches 8/35.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 8/35 is the correct probability.\n\nTherefore, the probability that one ball is red and the other is blue when two balls are picked at once without replacement is 8/35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{35}} \\]"
