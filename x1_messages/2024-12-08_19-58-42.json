        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: a group of people each shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, and there are a total of 45 handshakes. I need to find out how many people were in the group. Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorics problem.\n\nI remember that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of n items is given by the combination formula: C(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n - 2)!). This should be the same as the number of handshakes because each handshake is a unique pair of people.\n\nSo, if C(n, 2) = 45, I can set up the equation like this:\n\nn! / (2!(n - 2)!) = 45\n\nSimplifying the factorial expressions, n! / (n - 2)! is the same as n(n - 1), because the (n - 2)! terms cancel out. And 2! is just 2. So the equation becomes:\n\nn(n - 1)/2 = 45\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn(n - 1) = 90\n\nNow, I need to find an integer n such that n(n - 1) = 90. Let's try to solve this equation.\n\nI can either factor this quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nSo, n\u00b2 - n - 90 = 0\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -90 and add up to -1. Let's see:\n\n10 and 9: 10 * 9 = 90, but I need them to multiply to -90. So maybe -10 and 9: -10 * 9 = -90, and -10 + 9 = -1. That works.\n\nSo, I can factor the equation as:\n\n(n - 10)(n + 9) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives me n = 10 or n = -9. Since the number of people can't be negative, n must be 10.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check this. Maybe I can use another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use the formula for the sum of the first (n - 1) natural numbers, because each person shakes hands with (n - 1) others, but since each handshake is counted twice in this approach, I need to divide by 2.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is n(n - 1)/2, which is the same as C(n, 2).\n\nSo, n(n - 1)/2 = 45\n\nAs before, n(n - 1) = 90\n\nNow, instead of factoring, maybe I can try plugging in values for n to see which one satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's try n = 10:\n\n10 * 9 / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45. That matches.\n\nWhat about n = 9:\n\n9 * 8 / 2 = 72 / 2 = 36. That's less than 45.\n\nn = 11:\n\n11 * 10 / 2 = 110 / 2 = 55. That's more than 45.\n\nSo, n = 10 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have solved the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 360)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 \u221a361] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 19] / 2\n\nSo, n = (1 + 19)/2 = 20/2 = 10 or n = (1 - 19)/2 = -18/2 = -9\n\nAgain, n = 10 is the valid solution.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using sequences or series.\n\nThe number of handshakes can also be thought of as the sum of the first (n - 1) integers, since the first person shakes hands with (n - 1) others, the second with (n - 2), and so on, down to 1.\n\nSo, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n - 1) = [ (n - 1)n ] / 2\n\nSet this equal to 45:\n\n(n - 1)n / 2 = 45\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to n(n - 1) = 90.\n\nSo, again, n = 10.\n\nAlternatively, I could list out the handshakes for different n to see which one gives 45, but that might take too long for larger n.\n\nFor n = 1: 0 handshakes\n\nn = 2: 1 handshake\n\nn = 3: 3 handshakes\n\nn = 4: 6 handshakes\n\nn = 5: 10 handshakes\n\nn = 6: 15 handshakes\n\nn = 7: 21 handshakes\n\nn = 8: 28 handshakes\n\nn = 9: 36 handshakes\n\nn = 10: 45 handshakes. There it is.\n\nSo, all these methods lead me to the same conclusion: there were 10 people in the group.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other possible interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there a possibility that handshakes are not mutual, meaning that maybe handshakes are one-way? But the problem says \"shakes hands with everyone else exactly once,\" which implies that handshakes are mutual, so each handshake is counted once between two people.\n\nAlso, there's no mention of any restrictions, like some people not shaking hands with others. The problem states that each person shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, so it's a complete graph in terms of graph theory, where each edge represents a handshake.\n\nIn graph theory, the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is C(n, 2) = n(n - 1)/2, which again brings me back to the same equation.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the answer should be 10 people.\n\nLet me also consider if n(n - 1)/2 = 45 could have a non-integer solution, but since the number of people must be an integer, and we've found n = 10 satisfies the equation, and n = 9 is too small and n = 11 is too large, there are no other integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, the group consisted of 10 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
