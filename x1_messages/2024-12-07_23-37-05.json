But I can certainly list the top five tallest roller coasters in the world, including their names, locations, and heights, and you can easily convert this information into a CSV format if needed.\n\nAs of my last update, here are the top five tallest roller coasters in the world:\n\n1. **Kingda Ka** - Location: Six Flags Great Adventure, New Jersey, USA - Height: 139 meters (456 feet)\n\n2. **Top Thrill Dragster** - Location: Cedar Point, Ohio, USA - Height: 130 meters (428 feet)\n\n3. **Superman: Escape from Krypton** - Location: Six Flags Magic Mountain, California, USA - Height: 125 meters (410 feet)\n\n4. **Diamondbacks** - Location: Arizona Adventure, Williams, Arizona, USA - Height: 97 meters (318 feet)\n\n5. **Blue Fire** - Location: Phoenix Park, Germany - Height: 95 meters (312 feet)\n\nPlease note that records and rankings can change over time with new attractions being built, so it's always a good idea to check the latest updates from reliable sources.\n\nIf you need this information in a specific format or have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
