While the store owner is away, an employee decides to rearrange the animals so that Cage 1 now contains the hamster, Cage 2 contains the parrot, and Cage 3 contains the rabbit. The store owner returns without knowing about the changes. Where will the store owner expect to find each animal when showing them to customers?"

After the rearrangement, Cage 1 now contains the hamster, Cage 2 contains the parrot, and Cage 3 contains the rabbit.\n\nSince the store owner was not present during this change and is unaware of the rearrangement, their expectations would still align with the original setup. Therefore, when showing the animals to customers, the store owner would expect to find:\n\n- A parrot in Cage 1\n\n- A rabbit in Cage 2\n\n- A hamster in Cage 3\n\nThis is based on the initial arrangement before the employee made any changes. The owner hasn't been informed about the switch, so their knowledge remains unchanged."
