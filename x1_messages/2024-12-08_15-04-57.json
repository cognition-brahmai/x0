        "content": "So there are 50 people in a room, and each person knows at least one other person in the room. We need to figure out the minimum number of handshakes that must occur for everyone to have shaken hands with someone they know. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. Each person knows at least one other person, and we need to make sure that everyone shakes hands with someone they know. The goal is to find the minimum number of handshakes required to achieve this.\n\nI think this is a problem related to graph theory, where people can be represented as nodes, and the relationships (who knows whom) can be represented as edges. A handshake would correspond to an edge being \"activated\" or \"used.\"\n\nSo, in graph theory terms, we have a graph with 50 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of at least one (since each person knows at least one other person). We need to select a subset of the edges such that every vertex is incident to at least one selected edge. This is similar to finding a minimal edge cover of the graph.\n\nAn edge cover is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident to at least one edge in the set. The minimal edge cover is the one with the fewest possible edges.\n\nIn a graph where each vertex has degree at least one, the minimal edge cover can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{size of minimal edge cover} = n - c\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of vertices, and \\( c \\) is the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nWait, is that correct? Actually, I think I might be confusing it with the maximal matching or something else. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in a graph, the minimal edge cover can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{size of minimal edge cover} = n - n_{\\text{max}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of vertices, and \\( n_{\\text{max}} \\) is the number of vertices in a maximum matching.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look it up, but since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on what I know.\n\nAnother approach: since each person knows at least one other person, the graph is without isolated vertices. To minimize the number of handshakes, we need to maximize the number of people covered by each handshake.\n\nEach handshake involves two people, so ideally, each handshake should cover two people who haven't shaken hands yet but know each other.\n\nWait, but the problem is to have everyone shake hands with someone they know, not necessarily that everyone shakes hands with everyone they know, just with at least one person they know.\n\nSo, in the best-case scenario, the graph is a single connected component, like a complete graph, but that's not necessarily the case here.\n\nLet me think differently. If everyone knows exactly one other person, then the graph consists of disjoint edges or longer chains.\n\nIn the case where the graph consists of disjoint edges, like multiple isolated edges, then the minimal edge cover would be half the number of vertices, since each edge covers two people.\n\nWait, but if it's a matching, then yes. So, if the graph has a perfect matching, then the minimal edge cover would be 25 handshakes for 50 people.\n\nBut the problem states that each person knows at least one other person, not necessarily exactly one.\n\nSo, the graph could have components with cycles, etc.\n\nI need to find the minimal number of edges such that every vertex is incident to at least one of these edges.\n\nI recall that in graph theory, the minimal edge cover can be found by selecting edges in such a way that no vertex is left uncovered, and no edge can be removed without leaving some vertex uncovered.\n\nIn general, finding the minimal edge cover is equivalent to selecting a set of edges that covers all vertices with the smallest possible number of edges.\n\nIn a graph where each vertex has degree at least one, the minimal edge cover can be found using various algorithms, but I need a formula to find the minimum number based on the number of vertices and some other parameters.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of matching.\n\nI know that in a graph, the size of a minimal edge cover is related to the number of vertices and the size of a maximum matching.\n\nSpecifically, the formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{size of minimal edge cover} = n - \\text{number of vertices not covered by maximum matching}\n\\]\n\nWait, more precisely, it's:\n\n\\[\n\\text{size of minimal edge cover} = n - \\text{deficiency}\n\\]\n\nwhere deficiency is the difference between the number of vertices and twice the size of the maximum matching.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look it up in my memory. I think there's a formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{size of minimal edge cover} = n - \\text{number of vertices in maximum matching}\n\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in any graph, the size of a minimal edge cover plus the size of a maximal matching is at least equal to the number of vertices.\n\nIn fact, in bipartite graphs, the size of a minimal edge cover is equal to the number of vertices minus the number of vertices in a maximum matching.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies here.\n\nGiven that, for a general graph, the formula might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in a graph where each vertex has degree at least one, the minimal edge cover is at most floor(n/2), but I don't think that's accurate.\n\nLet me consider some examples.\n\nExample 1: 4 people, each knowing exactly one other person, forming two disjoint edges.\n\nSo, the graph is two disjoint edges: A-B and C-D.\n\nIn this case, the minimal edge cover would be two edges: A-B and C-D, covering all four people.\n\nSo, for 4 people, minimal edge cover is 2.\n\nSimilarly, for 50 people in such a configuration, it would be 25 handshakes.\n\nExample 2: 4 people forming a cycle: A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A.\n\nIn this case, we can cover all vertices with two edges, for example, A-B and C-D, or A-D and B-C.\n\nSo, again, the minimal edge cover is 2.\n\nWait, but in this case, n=4, and the minimal edge cover is 2, which is n/2.\n\nExample 3: A complete graph with 4 vertices (K4).\n\nIn K4, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nThe minimal edge cover would still be 2, for example, A-B and C-D.\n\nWait, but in K4, the minimal edge cover is 2, which is less than n/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Does K4 have a minimal edge cover of 2?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn K4, with vertices A, B, C, D, and edges between all of them.\n\nTo cover all vertices, we need to select edges such that every vertex is incident to at least one selected edge.\n\nIf I select A-B and C-D, that covers all vertices.\n\nIs there a way to cover all vertices with fewer than 2 edges? No, because each edge covers 2 vertices, and with only one edge, we can cover only 2 vertices, which is not enough for 4 vertices.\n\nSo, the minimal edge cover is 2, which is n/2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in K4 it could be less than n/2, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, no, in K4, n=4, n/2=2, and the minimal edge cover is indeed 2.\n\nSo, in these examples, the minimal edge cover is floor(n/2).\n\nWait, but in a complete graph with an odd number of vertices, say n=3 (K3), which is a triangle.\n\nIn K3, the minimal edge cover is 2, which is floor(3/2)=1, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, floor(3/2)=1, but in K3, the minimal edge cover is 2.\n\nSo, my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nHence, the minimal edge cover is not necessarily floor(n/2).\n\nWait, perhaps it's ceiling(n/2).\n\nIn K3, ceiling(3/2)=2, which matches the minimal edge cover of 2.\n\nIn K4, floor(n/2)=2, which matches.\n\nWait, but in K4, floor(n/2)=2, and minimal edge cover is 2.\n\nIn K3, floor(n/2)=1, but minimal edge cover is 2, which is greater than floor(n/2).\n\nSo, my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nHence, the minimal edge cover is not simply floor(n/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's n - maximum matching.\n\nIn K3, maximum matching is 1 (one edge), and n=3, so 3-1=2, which matches the minimal edge cover.\n\nIn K4, maximum matching is 2, and n=4, so 4-2=2, which matches the minimal edge cover.\n\nSo, it seems that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{minimal edge cover} = n - \\text{maximum matching}\n\\]\n\nThis seems to hold for these examples.\n\nLet me check another example.\n\nExample 4: 5 people, forming a path: A-B-C-D-E.\n\nIn this graph, the maximum matching is 2 (for example, A-B and C-D), leaving E unmatched.\n\nThen, according to the formula, minimal edge cover should be 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nIf we select A-B, C-D, and E-handshakes with someone, say E shakes hands with C (since E knows D, but to minimize, perhaps E shakes hands with D).\n\nWait, but in this path graph, degrees are 2 for internal nodes and 1 for endpoints.\n\nWait, in this path graph, a minimal edge cover would be A-B, C-D, and E-D, covering all vertices.\n\nSo, indeed, 3 edges, which matches n - maximum matching = 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nAnother example: a star graph with one central vertex connected to 4 others.\n\nIn this graph, maximum matching is 2: the central vertex connected to two others.\n\nWait, no. In a star graph with center C connected to A, B, D, E.\n\nThe maximum matching is 2: C-A and C-B, or C-A and C-D, etc.\n\nThen, minimal edge cover would be n - maximum matching = 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nIndeed, selecting C-A, C-B, and C-D covers all vertices.\n\nSo, it seems the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, in general, for any graph, the size of the minimal edge cover is n - the size of the maximum matching.\n\nGiven that, in our problem, we have a graph with 50 vertices, and each vertex has degree at least one.\n\nWe need to find the minimal edge cover, which is n - maximum matching.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of handshakes required is 50 minus the size of the maximum matching.\n\nNow, to minimize the number of handshakes, we need to maximize the size of the maximum matching.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible size of a matching in a graph with 50 vertices where each vertex has degree at least one?\n\nWell, in a matching, no two edges share a vertex, so each edge in the matching covers two vertices.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible size of a matching is floor(n/2), which in this case is floor(50/2) = 25.\n\nIs it possible to have a matching of size 25 in a graph with 50 vertices where each vertex has degree at least one?\n\nWell, if the graph has a perfect matching, which is a matching that covers all vertices, then the size of the matching would be 25.\n\nIn that case, the minimal edge cover would be 50 - 25 = 25.\n\nBut the problem states that each person knows at least one other person, but it doesn't specify that the graph has a perfect matching.\n\nSo, perhaps the graph doesn't have a perfect matching, meaning the maximum matching is less than 25.\n\nWait, but in a graph with 50 vertices and each vertex having degree at least one, is it possible to have a maximum matching smaller than 25?\n\nYes, for example, if the graph consists of multiple disjoint edges and some larger components.\n\nBut in the worst-case scenario for the maximum matching, suppose the graph has many small components.\n\nFor instance, if the graph has 25 disjoint edges, then the maximum matching is 25.\n\nIf the graph has some triangles or other structures, the maximum matching might be less.\n\nWait, but in any case, the maximum matching is at least floor(n/2), right?\n\nWait, no. In a graph where each vertex has degree at least one, the maximum matching can be less than floor(n/2).\n\nFor example, consider a graph with 50 vertices where one vertex is connected to another, and the remaining 48 vertices are paired in disjoint edges.\n\nIn this case, the maximum matching would be 24 (the 24 disjoint edges), and the minimal edge cover would be 50 - 24 = 26.\n\nBut is this the minimal possible matching size?\n\nWait, no. In that graph, actually, you can match the single edge and the 24 disjoint edges, totaling 25.\n\nWait, no, if one vertex is connected to another, forming a single edge, and the rest are paired, then the maximum matching is 25.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIn a graph with 50 vertices and each vertex having degree at least one, the maximum matching can range from floor(n/2) to floor(n/2), but actually, it can be less if the graph has structures that prevent a perfect matching.\n\nFor example, if the graph has an odd cycle, it might not have a perfect matching.\n\nBut in any case, the minimal edge cover is n - size of maximum matching.\n\nTo minimize the number of handshakes, we need to maximize the size of the maximum matching.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of handshakes is 50 minus the size of the maximum matching.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, where the graph has a perfect matching, the minimal edge cover is 25.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, where the maximum matching is smaller, the minimal edge cover is larger.\n\nBut the problem is to find the minimum number of handshakes that must occur in any such graph.\n\nWait, I need to be careful here.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of handshakes that must occur for everyone to have shaken hands with someone they know, regardless of the specific relationships.\n\nIn other words, what is the smallest number m such that in any graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, there exists an edge cover of size m.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal m that works for all such graphs.\n\nGiven that, we need to find the maximum over all such graphs of the minimal edge cover.\n\nWait, that sounds complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider that in any graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the minimal edge cover is at most 25.\n\nWait, but that's not true, as in some graphs, it could be higher.\n\nFor example, if the graph has a large odd cycle, the maximal matching might be less than 25, leading to a larger minimal edge cover.\n\nWait, but I need to think about the minimal edge cover in such graphs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{size of minimal edge cover} = n - \\text{number of vertices in maximum matching}\n\\]\n\nBut I need to find the minimal m such that in any graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the minimal edge cover is at most m.\n\nWait, that seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of handshakes required to cover all vertices.\n\nEach handshake covers two people, so in the best case, it's 25 handshakes.\n\nBut in some graphs, it might require more.\n\nSo, the minimal number that works for all such graphs would be the maximum minimal edge cover over all such graphs.\n\nSo, what's the maximum possible minimal edge cover for a graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1?\n\nWell, to maximize the minimal edge cover, we need to minimize the size of the maximum matching.\n\nSo, what's the smallest possible size of a maximum matching in a graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1?\n\nIn a graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the smallest possible maximum matching occurs when the graph has as many isolated edges as possible, leaving as many isolated vertices as possible.\n\nWait, but isolated vertices are not allowed, since each vertex has degree at least one.\n\nSo, if we have as many disjoint edges as possible, and the remaining vertices form pairs or larger components.\n\nWait, but since each vertex has degree at least one, we can't have isolated vertices.\n\nSo, the graph must be such that all vertices are connected to at least one other vertex.\n\nTherefore, the graph can be decomposed into connected components, each with no isolated vertices.\n\nIn such a graph, the size of the maximum matching is at least floor(n/2), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nActually, in a graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the size of the maximum matching can be as small as floor((n-c)/2), where c is the number of connected components.\n\nBut I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a graph where each connected component is a tree, the size of the maximum matching can be smaller.\n\nWait, but trees have perfect matchings under certain conditions.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider extreme cases.\n\nConsider a graph where one vertex is connected to another, forming a single edge, and the remaining 48 vertices are paired in 24 disjoint edges.\n\nIn this case, the maximum matching is 25 (one edge from the first component and 24 from the disjoint edges).\n\nThus, the minimal edge cover is 50 - 25 = 25.\n\nWait, but if the first component is just a single edge, and the rest are disjoint edges, then the maximum matching is indeed 25.\n\nHence, minimal edge cover is 25.\n\nIs there a graph where the maximum matching is smaller than 25?\n\nFor example, if we have a connected component with 3 vertices forming a triangle, and the remaining 47 vertices are paired in 23 disjoint edges.\n\nIn this case, the maximum matching in the triangle is 1, and in the disjoint edges, it's 23, totaling 24.\n\nThus, the minimal edge cover is 50 - 24 = 26.\n\nSo, in this case, we need 26 handshakes.\n\nSimilarly, if we have a connected component with 5 vertices forming a cycle, and the remaining 45 vertices are paired in 22 disjoint edges.\n\nThe maximum matching in the 5-cycle is 2, and in the disjoint edges is 22, totaling 24.\n\nThus, minimal edge cover is 50 - 24 = 26.\n\nWait, but in the 5-cycle, the maximum matching is 2, since we can match two edges, leaving one vertex uncovered.\n\nTherefore, the minimal edge cover is 5 - 2 = 3 for the cycle, and for the 45 vertices paired in 22 disjoint edges, the minimal edge cover is 23 (since 45 - 22 = 23).\n\nWait, but in the 5-cycle, the minimal edge cover is 3, as we need at least 3 edges to cover all 5 vertices.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's n - maximum matching = 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nYes, that holds.\n\nSo, for the entire graph, the minimal edge cover would be 3 + 23 = 26.\n\nSimilarly, in the previous example with a triangle and 24 disjoint edges, minimal edge cover is 3 + 24 = 27, but earlier I thought it was 26.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no, in the triangle, it's 3 edges to cover 3 vertices, and 24 edges to cover 48 vertices, totaling 27.\n\nBut earlier, I thought of 26, maybe I was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nActually, in the triangle, the minimal edge cover is 2, not 3.\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nIn a triangle, selecting any two edges covers all three vertices.\n\nSo, minimal edge cover is 2.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct.\n\nI must have misremembered earlier.\n\nSo, in the triangle, minimal edge cover is 2, and in the 48 vertices paired in 24 disjoint edges, minimal edge cover is 24.\n\nThus, total minimal edge cover is 2 + 24 = 26.\n\nSimilarly, in the 5-cycle, minimal edge cover is 3, and in the 45 vertices paired in 22 disjoint edges, minimal edge cover is 23, totaling 26.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 26 in one case and 27 in another, but actually, it's consistent.\n\nSo, in these examples, the minimal edge cover is 26.\n\nIs there a graph where the minimal edge cover is larger than 25?\n\nYes, as in the above examples, it's 26.\n\nSo, in a graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the minimal edge cover can be as large as 26.\n\nBut is there a graph where it's larger than 26?\n\nSuppose we have a connected component with 4 vertices forming a cycle (C4), and the remaining 46 vertices are paired in 23 disjoint edges.\n\nIn C4, the maximum matching is 2, so minimal edge cover is 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nPlus, for the 46 vertices, minimal edge cover is 23.\n\nTotal: 2 + 23 = 25.\n\nWait, that's 25.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nIn C4, maximum matching is 2, so minimal edge cover is 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nSo, total is 25.\n\nAlternatively, if we have a connected component with 4 vertices forming a path (P4), which has maximum matching of size 1 (since we can match only one edge, leaving one endpoint uncovered), so minimal edge cover is 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nThen, with 46 vertices paired in 23 disjoint edges, minimal edge cover is 23.\n\nTotal: 3 + 23 = 26.\n\nSo, depending on the structure, it can be 25 or 26.\n\nSimilarly, if we have a connected component with 3 vertices forming a triangle, which has minimal edge cover of 2, and 47 vertices paired in 23 disjoint edges, minimal edge cover is 23.\n\nTotal: 2 + 23 = 25.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 26.\n\nMaybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the triangle, minimal edge cover is 2, and in 47 vertices paired in 23 disjoint edges, minimal edge cover is 23.\n\nTotal: 2 + 23 = 25.\n\nBut 47 vertices paired in 23 disjoint edges would cover 46 vertices, leaving one vertex alone, which needs an additional handshake, making it 24 for that part.\n\nWait, no, if there are 47 vertices paired in 23 disjoint edges, that covers 46 vertices, leaving one vertex unmatched.\n\nBut each edge covers two vertices, so 23 edges cover 46 vertices.\n\nThe remaining vertex must shake hands with someone, but since it's connected to at least one other vertex, it can shake hands with one of its neighbors.\n\nSo, that would be an additional handshake, making the minimal edge cover 23 + 1 = 24 for the 47 vertices.\n\nPlus the 2 from the triangle, total 24 + 2 = 26.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because 23 edges already cover 46 vertices, and the remaining vertex can be covered by shaking hands with one of its neighbors, adding one more edge, totaling 24 edges.\n\nPlus the 2 from the triangle, totaling 26.\n\nBut in the C4 example, we had minimal edge cover of 2 for the C4 and 23 for the 46 vertices, totaling 25.\n\nSo, depending on the structure, it can be 25 or 26.\n\nIs there a way to get a higher minimal edge cover?\n\nSuppose we have a connected component with 5 vertices forming a cycle (C5), which has minimal edge cover of 3, and 45 vertices paired in 22 disjoint edges, minimal edge cover of 22.\n\nTotal: 3 + 22 = 25.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 26.\n\nMaybe I'm making a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal edge cover for C5 is 3, and for 45 vertices in 22 disjoint edges plus one vertex, which needs an additional handshake, making it 23.\n\nWait, but 45 vertices in 22 disjoint edges cover 44 vertices, leaving one vertex, which needs an additional handshake, making it 23.\n\nPlus the 3 from C5, totaling 26.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps I need a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that in any graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the minimal edge cover is at least 25 and can be up to 25 or 26, depending on the structure.\n\nBut I need to find the minimal number m such that in any such graph, m handshakes are sufficient.\n\nSo, m should be at least the maximum minimal edge cover over all such graphs.\n\nFrom the examples above, it seems that the minimal edge cover can be up to 25 or 26.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the minimal edge cover is at most 25.\n\nWait, but earlier examples suggest it can be 26.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the ceiling of n/2.\n\nFor n=50, ceiling(50/2)=25.\n\nBut in some graphs, it's 26, as per earlier examples.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal edge cover is at most floor((n+1)/2).\n\nFor n=50, floor(51/2)=25.\n\nBut earlier examples suggest it can be 26, which is more than 25.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is ceil(n/2).\n\nFor n=50, ceil(50/2)=25.\n\nBut in some graphs, it's 26, which is more than 25.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in graphs with an even number of vertices, the minimal edge cover is floor(n/2), and with odd number of vertices, it's ceil(n/2).\n\nBut in our earlier examples, for n=50, it's 25, but in some cases, it's 26, which contradicts this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider that in any graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the minimal edge cover is at least 25 and at most 25.\n\nWait, but earlier examples suggest it can be 26.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in graphs where the maximum matching is 25, the minimal edge cover is 25, and in graphs where the maximum matching is 24, the minimal edge cover is 26.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of handshakes that must occur in any such graph is 25.\n\nWait, but in the case where the maximum matching is 24, the minimal edge cover is 50 - 24 = 26.\n\nSo, in that case, it's 26.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number m that works for all such graphs must be at least 26.\n\nBut the problem is to find the minimal number of handshakes that must occur in any such graph, which seems to be 25 in some graphs and 26 in others.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the minimal m such that in any graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, there exists an edge cover of size m.\n\nSo, m must be at least the maximum minimal edge cover over all such graphs.\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the minimal edge cover can be up to 26.\n\nTherefore, m must be at least 26.\n\nBut in some graphs, like those with a perfect matching, m=25 is sufficient.\n\nHowever, since there are graphs where m=25 is not sufficient, we need m=26 to cover all cases.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of handshakes that must occur in any such graph is 26.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that in any graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the minimal edge cover is at most 25.\n\nBut the earlier example with a triangle and 47 vertices in disjoint edges suggested a minimal edge cover of 26.\n\nTherefore, m must be at least 26.\n\nHence, the answer should be 26.\n\nBut I feel like I might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal edge cover is always at least floor((n+1)/2).\n\nFor n=50, that would be floor(51/2)=25.\n\nBut in some graphs, it's 26, as per earlier examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is ceil(n/2).\n\nFor n=50, ceil(50/2)=25.\n\nBut in some graphs, it's 26, which is more than 25.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal number of handshakes is 26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that in any graph with 50 vertices and minimum degree 1, the minimal edge cover is at most 25.\n\nBut that seems contradicted by the earlier examples.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nSuppose we have a graph where the maximum matching is 24.\n\nThen, the minimal edge cover is 50 - 24 = 26.\n\nTherefore, in such a graph, we need at least 26 handshakes.\n\nHence, the minimal number m that works for all such graphs must be at least 26.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 26.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the handshake theorem.\n\nWait, no, that's about handshakes and degrees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be applied here.\n\nBut I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of people who need to shake hands.\n\nEach handshake covers two people, but some people might know multiple people, so it's not straightforward.\n\nGiven the earlier analysis, I think the minimal number of handshakes required is 26.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 26.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]"
