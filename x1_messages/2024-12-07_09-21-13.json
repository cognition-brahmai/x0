        "content": "Let's see. There are two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The factory produces them in a certain ratio: for every 7 Type A widgets, there are 3 Type B widgets. And the total number of widgets produced last month was 5000. I need to find out how many Type A widgets were produced.\n\nFirst, I should understand the ratio thing. So, for every 7 Type A widgets, there are 3 Type B widgets. That means the ratio of Type A to Type B is 7:3.\n\nNow, ratios can be tricky, but I think I can handle this. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 3, which is 10. So, the total production of 5000 widgets is divided into 10 parts.\n\nTo find out how many widgets are in each part, I can divide the total number of widgets by the total number of parts. So, 5000 divided by 10 is 500. That means each part represents 500 widgets.\n\nNow, since Type A widgets are 7 parts, I can multiply 7 by 500 to get the number of Type A widgets. Similarly, Type B widgets are 3 parts, so 3 times 500 would give me the number of Type B widgets.\n\nLet me do the math for Type A: 7 times 500 is 3500. So, 3500 Type A widgets were produced.\n\nAnd for Type B: 3 times 500 is 1500. So, 1500 Type B widgets were produced.\n\nTo check if this makes sense, I can add them up: 3500 + 1500 equals 5000, which matches the total given. Also, the ratio is 3500:1500, which simplifies to 7:3 when divided by 500. So, that checks out.\n\nI think that's the answer: 3500 Type A widgets were produced.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3500} \\]"
