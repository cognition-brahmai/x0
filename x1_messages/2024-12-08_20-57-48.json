        "content": "D. Miguel de Cervantes is the author of \"Don Quixote.\" This novel, published in two parts in 1605 and 1615, is considered one of the most influential works of literature from the Spanish Golden Age and is often regarded as one of the greatest novels ever written. It tells the story of Alonso Quixano, who becomes so engrossed in chivalric romances that he loses his sanity and decides to become a knight-errant, renaming himself Don Quixote de la Mancha. He embarks on adventures with his sidekick, Sancho Panza, attempting to revive chivalry and right wrongs.\n\nGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is a Colombian novelist, known for his works of magical realism, such as \"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\" Pablo Neruda was a Chilean poet, diplomat, and politician who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1971. Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentine writer who is highly regarded for his short stories and poems, and he is known for his use of philosophical themes in his works.\n\nWhile all these authors are significant figures in Spanish-language literature, it is Miguel de Cervantes who authored \"Don Quixote.\""
