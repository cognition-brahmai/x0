It's a popular instrument in jazz music and is played by pressing keys that open and close holes on a long tube, which in turn produces different pitches. The saxophone comes in various sizes and pitches, such as soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone, each with its own unique sound and range. Jazz musicians often use saxophones to play melodic lines and solos, contributing to the expressive and improvisational nature of the genre."
