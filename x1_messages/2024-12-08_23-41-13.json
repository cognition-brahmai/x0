        "content": "So I have this problem here: given a continuous function g(x) defined on the interval [a, b], I need to prove that there exists a point c in [a, b] such that g(c) equals the average of g(a) and g(b), right? So, g(c) = (g(a) + g(b))/2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of continuous functions. I know that the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) is crucial here. The IVT states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], then it takes on every value between g(a) and g(b) at least once. So, if I can show that (g(a) + g(b))/2 is between g(a) and g(b), then by IVT, there must be some c in [a, b] where g(c) equals that average.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose g(a) is less than g(b). Then, (g(a) + g(b))/2 is just the midpoint between g(a) and g(b). Since g is continuous, it should hit every value between g(a) and g(b), including this midpoint. Similarly, if g(b) is less than g(a), the same logic applies, but the roles are reversed. And if g(a) equals g(b), then the average is just g(a), and any c in [a, b] would satisfy g(c) = g(a), since the function is constant in that case.\n\nWait, but I need to consider if g is constant. If g(x) is constant on [a, b], then g(x) = g(a) for all x in [a, b], so certainly, there exists a c where g(c) = (g(a) + g(b))/2, because g(a) = g(b), so (g(a) + g(b))/2 = g(a).\n\nNow, what if g is not constant? Then, g(a) \u2260 g(b). Without loss of generality, assume g(a) < g(b). Then, (g(a) + g(b))/2 is strictly between g(a) and g(b). By the IVT, since g is continuous, there exists at least one c in (a, b) such that g(c) = (g(a) + g(b))/2.\n\nSimilarly, if g(b) < g(a), then (g(a) + g(b))/2 is between g(b) and g(a), and again, by IVT, there exists c in (a, b) such that g(c) equals that average.\n\nSo, in all cases, whether g is constant or not, such a c exists.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nProof:\n\nCase 1: g(a) = g(b).\n\nThen, (g(a) + g(b))/2 = g(a) = g(b).\n\nSince g is continuous on [a, b], and g(x) = g(a) for all x in [a, b], any c in [a, b] satisfies g(c) = (g(a) + g(b))/2.\n\nCase 2: g(a) \u2260 g(b).\n\nAssume without loss of generality that g(a) < g(b).\n\nLet k = (g(a) + g(b))/2.\n\nThen, g(a) < k < g(b).\n\nSince g is continuous on [a, b], by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists at least one c in (a, b) such that g(c) = k.\n\nTherefore, there exists c in [a, b] such that g(c) = (g(a) + g(b))/2.\n\nSimilarly, if g(b) < g(a), then k = (g(a) + g(b))/2 is between g(b) and g(a), and by IVT, there exists c in (a, b) such that g(c) = k.\n\nIn conclusion, in all cases, there exists at least one c in [a, b] such that g(c) = (g(a) + g(b))/2.\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nIs there anything missing here? I think this covers all possibilities. I've considered the case when the function is constant, when g(a) is less than g(b), and when g(b) is less than g(a). The IVT applies in the non-constant cases, and the constant case is trivial.\n\nMaybe I should also consider if the function is not monotonic. Does it matter? No, because the IVT only requires continuity, not monotonicity. As long as the function is continuous and we're looking for a value between g(a) and g(b), IVT guarantees the existence of such a c.\n\nAlright, I think this is a solid proof.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{There exists } c \\in [a, b] \\text{ such that } g(c) = \\frac{g(a) + g(b)}{2}} \\]"
