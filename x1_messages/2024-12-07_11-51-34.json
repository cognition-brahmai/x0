        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units of product A each day, right? And it costs $15 to make each unit, but they sell each one for $25. We need to find out how much profit they make after 30 days.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how much profit they make per unit. Profit per unit would be the selling price minus the production cost, right? So that's $25 minus $15, which is $10 per unit.\n\nNow, they produce 500 units each day, so daily profit would be 500 units times $10 per unit. That should be $5,000 per day.\n\nThen, to find out the profit after 30 days, I just need to multiply the daily profit by 30. So $5,000 times 30 equals $150,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that sound right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with per unit profit: $25 selling price minus $15 production cost equals $10 profit per unit. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 500 units per day times $10 profit per unit equals $5,000 daily profit. Still looks good.\n\nFinally, $5,000 per day times 30 days equals $150,000. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other costs involved, like fixed costs or something. The problem doesn't mention any other expenses, so perhaps it's just based on the production cost per unit.\n\nI think the answer is $150,000 profit after 30 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150000} \\]"
