It was indeed founded by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald in 1940, initially as a barbecue restaurant in San Bernardino, California. However, it was Ray Kroc, who joined the company in 1955 as a franchise agent, who played a pivotal role in expanding it into the global empire it is today. Under Kroc's leadership, McDonald's adopted the business model of a franchised restaurant with a focus on speed, quality, service, and cleanliness, which revolutionized the fast-food industry."
