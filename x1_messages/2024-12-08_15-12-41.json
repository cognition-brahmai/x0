        "content": "So the city is planning to upgrade its public transportation system by adding 50 new buses over the next three years. Each bus can seat 60 passengers and costs $300,000. Additionally, they need to build new bus depots for maintenance and storage. Each depot costs $2 million and can hold up to 20 buses. We need to calculate the total cost of this project, which includes the purchase of buses, construction of depots, and annual operating expenses of $100,000 per bus. Also, we need to estimate how many more passengers can be accommodated with this upgrade.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the cost of the buses. There are 50 buses, each costing $300,000.\n\nTotal bus cost = Number of buses \u00d7 Cost per bus\nTotal bus cost = 50 \u00d7 300,000 = $15,000,000\n\nNext, we need to determine how many depots are required. Each depot can accommodate up to 20 buses.\n\nNumber of depots needed = Ceiling of (Number of buses / Buses per depot)\nNumber of depots needed = Ceiling of (50 / 20) = Ceiling of (2.5) = 3 depots\n\nNow, calculate the total cost for the depots.\n\nTotal depot cost = Number of depots \u00d7 Cost per depot\nTotal depot cost = 3 \u00d7 2,000,000 = $6,000,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the annual operating expenses for the buses. Each bus has an annual operating expense of $100,000.\n\nAnnual operating expense = Number of buses \u00d7 Operating expense per bus\nAnnual operating expense = 50 \u00d7 100,000 = $5,000,000 per year\n\nSince the project spans three years, we need to calculate the total operating expenses over these three years.\n\nTotal operating expense over three years = Annual operating expense \u00d7 3\nTotal operating expense over three years = 5,000,000 \u00d7 3 = $15,000,000\n\nNow, let's sum up all the costs:\n\nTotal project cost = Total bus cost + Total depot cost + Total operating expense over three years\nTotal project cost = 15,000,000 + 6,000,000 + 15,000,000 = $36,000,000\n\nFinally, let's estimate the number of additional passengers that can be accommodated with the upgraded system. Each bus can seat 60 passengers.\n\nAdditional seating capacity = Number of buses \u00d7 Seating per bus\nAdditional seating capacity = 50 \u00d7 60 = 3,000 passengers\n\nSo, the total cost of the project is $36,000,000, and the upgraded system can accommodate an additional 3,000 passengers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total cost of the project is \\boxed{36000000}, and the additional passenger capacity is \\boxed{3000}."
