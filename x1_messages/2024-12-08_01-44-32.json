        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 5 families in a town, and each family has at least one child. The total number of children is 12. We need to find out the maximum number of families that can have exactly 3 children.\n\nFirst, since each family has at least one child, we can start by assigning one child to each family. That means we've already allocated 5 children (one per family), leaving us with 12 - 5 = 7 children to distribute among the 5 families.\n\nNow, we want to maximize the number of families that have exactly 3 children. To achieve this, we should try to give as many families as possible two more children each, so that their total becomes 3 children.\n\nLet's see how many families we can give two more children to with the remaining 7 children.\n\nIf we give two more children to a family, that family will have exactly 3 children. So, for each family we want to reach exactly 3 children, we need to assign 2 additional children to them.\n\nSo, with 7 children left, how many families can we give 2 children each?\n\nLet's divide 7 by 2. 7 \u00f7 2 = 3 with a remainder of 1.\n\nThis means we can give 2 children each to 3 families, using up 6 children, and have 1 child left over.\n\nAfter doing this, 3 families will have exactly 3 children each (1 initial child + 2 additional children).\n\nNow, we have 1 child left to assign to the remaining 2 families.\n\nWe need to decide how to distribute this last child.\n\nSince we've already maximized the number of families with exactly 3 children by assigning 2 additional children to 3 families, the remaining 2 families will have only 1 child each, plus the 1 remaining child can be assigned to one of them.\n\nSo, one of the remaining two families will have 1 + 1 = 2 children, and the other will have 1 child.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of families that can have exactly 3 children is 3.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's a way to have more than 3 families with exactly 3 children.\n\nSuppose we try to give 3 children to 4 families.\n\nFirst, assign 1 child to each family: 5 children assigned.\n\nThen, to make 4 families have exactly 3 children, we need to give 2 more children to each of these 4 families: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 children.\n\nBut we only have 12 - 5 = 7 children left to assign.\n\n8 is greater than 7, so it's not possible to give 2 more children to 4 families with only 7 children left.\n\nTherefore, 4 families with exactly 3 children is not possible.\n\nWhat about 3 families with exactly 3 children, as we did earlier?\n\nWe assign 1 child to each family: 5 children.\n\nThen, give 2 more children to 3 families: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 children.\n\nTotal children assigned: 5 + 6 = 11 children.\n\nWe had 12 children in total, so 12 - 11 = 1 child left.\n\nThis remaining child can be assigned to any of the remaining 2 families, which already have 1 child each.\n\nSo, one of them will have 2 children, and the other will have 1 child.\n\nThus, with 3 families having exactly 3 children, and the remaining 2 having 2 and 1 children respectively, the total adds up to 12 children.\n\nIs there another way to distribute the children to have more than 3 families with exactly 3 children?\n\nLet's consider if we can have 3 families with 3 children and one family with 4 children.\n\nAssign 1 child to each family: 5 children.\n\nThen, give 2 more children to 3 families: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 children.\n\nTotal so far: 5 + 6 = 11 children.\n\nThen, give 1 more child to one of the remaining families, making it have 2 children.\n\nTotal: 11 + 1 = 12 children.\n\nSo, in this case, 3 families have 3 children, and one family has 2 children, and one family has 1 child.\n\nThis is similar to the previous distribution, but with a different allocation.\n\nAlternatively, if we try to have 3 families with 3 children and one family with 3 children, but that would be 4 families with 3 children, which we've already determined is not possible with only 7 children left to assign after giving each family 1 child.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of families that can have exactly 3 children is indeed 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
