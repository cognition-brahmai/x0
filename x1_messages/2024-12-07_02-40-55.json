        "content": "So I have this function f(x) = C * e^(-x^2), and I need to find the value of the constant C that makes this a probability density function. I know that for a function to be a probability density function, the area under its curve from negative infinity to positive infinity has to be equal to 1. That means I need to integrate f(x) from -\u221e to \u221e and set that equal to 1, then solve for C.\n\nSo, the integral I need to evaluate is \u222b from -\u221e to \u221e of C * e^(-x^2) dx = 1.\n\nI can factor out the constant C from the integral, so it becomes C * \u222b from -\u221e to \u221e of e^(-x^2) dx = 1.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the integral of e^(-x^2) from -\u221e to \u221e. This is a famous integral known as the Gaussian integral, and its value is sqrt(\u03c0). I've seen this in my calculus class, but to be honest, I don't remember off the top of my head how to derive it. Maybe I should try to recall the steps.\n\nOne way to find the Gaussian integral is to consider the square of the integral and convert to polar coordinates. Let me try that.\n\nLet I = \u222b from -\u221e to \u221e of e^(-x^2) dx.\n\nThen I^2 = [\u222b from -\u221e to \u221e of e^(-x^2) dx] * [\u222b from -\u221e to \u221e of e^(-y^2) dy].\n\nSince the variables x and y are independent, I can write this as a double integral: I^2 = \u222b\u222b over the entire xy-plane of e^(-(x^2 + y^2)) dx dy.\n\nNow, switching to polar coordinates, where x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8, and dx dy = r dr d\u03b8.\n\nThe limits of integration for r are from 0 to \u221e, and for \u03b8 are from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nSo, I^2 = \u222b from 0 to 2\u03c0 \u222b from 0 to \u221e e^(-r^2) * r dr d\u03b8.\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to r.\n\nLet me set u = r^2, then du = 2r dr, so r dr = du/2.\n\nWhen r = 0, u = 0; when r = \u221e, u = \u221e.\n\nSo, the inner integral becomes \u222b from 0 to \u221e e^(-u) * (du/2) = (1/2) \u222b from 0 to \u221e e^(-u) du.\n\nThis is a standard integral, and its value is (1/2) * [ -e^(-u) ] from 0 to \u221e = (1/2) * (0 - (-1)) = 1/2.\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for I^2:\n\nI^2 = \u222b from 0 to 2\u03c0 (1/2) d\u03b8 = (1/2) * [ \u03b8 ] from 0 to 2\u03c0 = (1/2) * (2\u03c0 - 0) = \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, I^2 = \u03c0, so I = sqrt(\u03c0).\n\nGoing back to my original equation:\n\nC * I = 1 \u21d2 C * sqrt(\u03c0) = 1 \u21d2 C = 1 / sqrt(\u03c0).\n\nWait, but sometimes it's nice to rationalize the denominator. So, C = 1 / sqrt(\u03c0) = sqrt(\u03c0) / \u03c0.\n\nBut I think 1 / sqrt(\u03c0) is acceptable.\n\nLet me check if there are any other conditions I need to consider. For f(x) to be a probability density function, it also has to be non-negative for all x, and it has to be integrable over the real line.\n\nGiven that e^(-x^2) is always positive, and C is positive (since 1 / sqrt(\u03c0) is positive), f(x) is non-negative.\n\nAlso, as we've just shown, the integral from -\u221e to \u221e is finite and equal to 1 when C = 1 / sqrt(\u03c0).\n\nTherefore, the value of C that makes f(x) a probability density function is C = 1 / sqrt(\u03c0).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}} \\]"
