        "content": "So there's this box with different colored balls: 5 red, 7 blue, and 8 green. And the question is, what's the probability of picking a red ball without looking?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening. It's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is drawing a red ball. So, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red balls, which is 5.\n\nNext, I need to find the total number of possible outcomes. That would be the total number of balls in the box. So, I add up all the balls: 5 red + 7 blue + 8 green. Let's see, 5 plus 7 is 12, and 12 plus 8 is 20. So, there are 20 balls in total.\n\nNow, the probability (P) of drawing a red ball is:\n\nP(red) = Number of red balls / Total number of balls\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(red) = 5 / 20\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\n20 \u00f7 5 = 4\n\nSo, P(red) = 1/4\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal or a percentage. 1 divided by 4 is 0.25, which is the same as 25%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball is 1/4 or 25%.\n\nDoes that make sense? I think I've got it right. But just to double-check, let me go through it again.\n\nTotal balls: 5 red + 7 blue + 8 green = 20 balls.\n\nProbability of red: Number of red balls divided by total balls, which is 5/20 = 1/4.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
