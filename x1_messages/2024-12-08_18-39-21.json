        "content": "Ah, that sounds like a fun question! So, you're asking about a popular toy that was invented in 1943 by Richard James. It's a helical spring that can \"walk\" down stairs and slopes when you push it. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nI remember hearing about a toy like that. It's sort of like a coil that can kind of move by itself. I think it's called a \"Slinky.\" Yeah, that sounds right. Slinky is a helical spring that can walk down stairs in a really interesting way. I've seen videos of it doing that; it's pretty cool.\n\nBut let me make sure. Richard James was an engineer who was working with torsion springs, and he accidentally knocked one off a shelf, and he saw it \"walk\" down in a series of arcs. That's when he got the idea to create the Slinky toy. He and his wife Betty developed it further, and it became a huge success, especially after demonstrating it at a toy store in Philadelphia.\n\nSo, to confirm, the toy you're referring to is indeed the Slinky. It's made of helical springs, usually metal or plastic, and it can traverse down stairs or inclines in a walking motion when given a slight push or released from a higher point.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the Slinky or its invention?\n"
