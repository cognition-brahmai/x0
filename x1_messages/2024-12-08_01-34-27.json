        "content": "To address the user's request to count the number of occurrences for each category in the supplied CSV file, I will utilize the `csv_analytics` function. Specifically, the action required is to perform a \"grouped_count\" operation, which will count the occurrences of each unique category.\n\n### Final Solution\n\nTo achieve the task of counting the number of occurrences for each category in the supplied CSV file, we will use the `csv_analytics` function with the appropriate parameters. Here's how to structure the request in YAML format:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: csv_analytics\nparams:\n  action: grouped_count\n  column: category\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Selection**:\n   - We choose `csv_analytics` because it is designed for operations on CSV data, such as aggregation, counting, and filtering.\n\n2. **Action**:\n   - The `action` parameter is set to `grouped_count`. This specifies that we want to count the occurrences of each unique value in the specified column.\n\n3. **Column**:\n   - The `column` parameter is set to `category`, assuming that the categories are listed in a column named \"category\". If the column has a different name, it should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis configuration will instruct the system to read the CSV file, group the data by the categories in the specified column, and count the number of occurrences for each category, thereby fulfilling the user's request."
