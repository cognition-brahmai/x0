        "content": "So I've got this problem here about filling a cylindrical container with water. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know the volume of the cylindrical container because that'll tell me how much water it can hold. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nGiven that the radius is 4 inches and the height is 6 inches, I can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = \u03c0*(4 inches)\u00b2*(6 inches) = \u03c0*(16 inches\u00b2)*(6 inches) = 96\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nNow, the container is being filled with water at a rate of 16 cubic inches per minute. To find out how long it will take to fill the container completely, I need to divide the total volume by the filling rate.\n\nSo, time = volume / rate = 96\u03c0 cubic inches / 16 cubic inches per minute.\n\nLet me calculate that: 96\u03c0 / 16 = 6\u03c0 minutes.\n\nBut \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 6\u03c0 is roughly 18.8496 minutes.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify to use an approximation for \u03c0, so maybe I can leave the answer in terms of \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, if I need a numerical value, I can use \u03c0 \u2248 3.14.\n\nSo, time \u2248 6 * 3.14 = 18.84 minutes.\n\nBut perhaps I should check if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think about the cross-sectional area and the rate of filling.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the cylinder is A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*(4 inches)\u00b2 = 16\u03c0 inches\u00b2.\n\nIf water is being added at a rate of 16 cubic inches per minute, then the rate of increase in height h can be found using the formula:\n\nRate = A * (dh/dt), where dh/dt is the rate of change of height.\n\nWait, but in this case, I'm given the rate of volume addition, which is 16 cubic inches per minute, and I'm to find the total time to fill the container.\n\nI think my first approach is correct.\n\nTotal time = total volume / filling rate = 96\u03c0 cubic inches / 16 cubic inches per minute = 6\u03c0 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the volume is increasing by 16 cubic inches every minute, I can find out how many minutes it takes to reach 96\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nSo, minutes = 96\u03c0 / 16 = 6\u03c0 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to express this in decimal form, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, then:\n\nTime \u2248 6 * 3.1416 \u2248 18.8496 minutes.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 18.85 minutes.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the units more carefully.\n\nVolume is in cubic inches, rate is in cubic inches per minute, so time should be in minutes, which it is.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the volume of the cylinder is 96\u03c0 cubic inches, and if it's being filled at 16 cubic inches per minute, then the time required is indeed 96\u03c0 / 16 = 6\u03c0 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 16 cubic inches per minute is the filling rate, I can find out how many minutes it takes to reach 96\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the container will be completely filled in 6\u03c0 minutes, which is approximately 18.85 minutes.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if there's any other factor involved, like the shape of the container or anything else mentioned in the problem.\n\nThe problem states that it's a cylindrical container with given radius and height, and it's being filled at a constant rate of 16 cubic inches per minute.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor to consider here.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 6\u03c0 minutes, or approximately 18.85 minutes.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a simpler way to approach this problem.\n\nWait, another approach: since the volume is 96\u03c0 cubic inches and the filling rate is 16 cubic inches per minute, perhaps I can think of it as the container fills at a rate that would fill 16 cubic inches every minute.\n\nSo, to find out how many minutes it takes to fill 96\u03c0 cubic inches, I can set up the equation:\n\n16t = 96\u03c0, where t is time in minutes.\n\nThen, solving for t: t = 96\u03c0 / 16 = 6\u03c0 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the container has a volume of 96\u03c0 cubic inches and is being filled at 16 cubic inches per minute, the time required is directly the volume divided by the rate.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and I can't see any mistake in this approach.\n\nTherefore, the container will be completely filled in 6\u03c0 minutes, or approximately 18.85 minutes.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should verify the volume calculation.\n\nVolume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nGiven r = 4 inches, h = 6 inches.\n\nSo, V = \u03c0*(4)\u00b2*(6) = \u03c0*16*6 = 96\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the approximate value of \u03c0 as 3.1416, then V \u2248 96*3.1416 \u2248 301.5936 cubic inches.\n\nThen, time = volume / rate = 301.5936 / 16 \u2248 18.8496 minutes, which rounds to approximately 18.85 minutes.\n\nBut again, the problem might accept the answer in terms of \u03c0, which is 6\u03c0 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a need to consider the units more carefully.\n\nThe rate is 16 cubic inches per minute, and the volume is in cubic inches, so time is in minutes, which is consistent.\n\nI don't think there's any conversion needed here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the container has any thickness or if there's any loss due to evaporation or other factors, but the problem doesn't mention any of that, so I assume ideal conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6\u03c0 minutes, or approximately 18.85 minutes.\n\nBut to match the expected answer format, I should perhaps present it as 6\u03c0 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a numerical value, then 18.85 minutes.\n\nBut since the problem mentions \"how long will it take to fill the container completely?\", and doesn't specify the form of the answer, both could be acceptable.\n\nHowever, in mathematical problems, it's often preferred to leave the answer in terms of \u03c0 unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, I'll go with 6\u03c0 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if I need to provide a numerical approximation, I can say approximately 18.85 minutes.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I'll present both.\n\nFinal answer: 6\u03c0 minutes, or approximately 18.85 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6\\pi \\text{ minutes}
