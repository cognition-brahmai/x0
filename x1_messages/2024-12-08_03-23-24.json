        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this basketball player who's been averaging 25 points per game over 20 games, and now he wants to raise his average to 28 points per game after playing 5 more games. I need to figure out how many points in total he needs to score in those next 5 games to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate how many points he has already scored in the 20 games. Since his average is 25 points per game, I can multiply 25 by 20 to get the total points so far.\n\n25 points/game * 20 games = 500 points\n\nOkay, so he has 500 points from 20 games. Now, he's going to play 5 more games, so his total number of games will be 20 + 5 = 25 games.\n\nHe wants his average to be 28 points per game over these 25 games. So, to find out the total points he needs after 25 games, I can multiply 28 by 25.\n\n28 points/game * 25 games = 700 points\n\nAlright, so he needs a total of 700 points after 25 games to have an average of 28 points per game.\n\nBut he already has 500 points from the first 20 games. So, to find out how many points he needs to score in the next 5 games, I can subtract the points he already has from the total points he needs.\n\n700 points - 500 points = 200 points\n\nSo, he needs to score a total of 200 points in the next 5 games.\n\nBut the question might be asking for the average points per game he needs in these next 5 games. If that's the case, I can divide the total points needed in these 5 games by 5.\n\n200 points / 5 games = 40 points/game\n\nSo, he needs to average 40 points per game in the next 5 games to increase his overall average to 28 points per game.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf he scores 40 points in each of the next 5 games, he'll score 200 points in total for those games. Added to his existing 500 points, that's 700 points in 25 games, which is an average of 28 points per game. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of total points needed and points already scored.\n\nHe wants an average of 28 points over 25 games, which is 700 points, and he has 500 points from 20 games, so he needs 200 more points from 5 games, which is an average of 40 points per game.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total points needed and then see how much more he needs to score.\n\nTotal points needed: 28 * 25 = 700\n\nPoints already scored: 25 * 20 = 500\n\nPoints needed in next 5 games: 700 - 500 = 200\n\nAverage points per game needed: 200 / 5 = 40\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 40 points per game.\n\nI think that's clear.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
