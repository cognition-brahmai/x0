        "content": "Sure! Here's a recursive function in JavaScript that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```javascript\nfunction gcd(a, b) {\n    if (b === 0) {\n        return a;\n    } else {\n        return gcd(b, a % b);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are the two numbers for which you want to find the GCD. It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm repeatedly replaces the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The non-zero number at that point is the GCD.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. If `b` is zero, the GCD is `a`.\n2. Otherwise, it calls itself with `b` and `a % b` as the new arguments.\n\nThis process continues recursively until `b` becomes zero.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(gcd(48, 18)); // Output: 6\nconsole.log(gcd(56, 98)); // Output: 14\nconsole.log(gcd(20, 5));  // Output: 5\nconsole.log(gcd(17, 13)); // Output: 1\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
