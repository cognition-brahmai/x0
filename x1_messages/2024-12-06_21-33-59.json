        "content": "The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, was built in Rome under the Roman Emperor Vespasian and completed by his successor Titus in 80 AD. It was primarily used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators, who were seated according to their social status, with the lower levels reserved for the elite and higher levels for the general public. These events were often used to entertain the populace and to promote the power and generosity of the ruling emperors. Over time, the Colosseum also served other purposes, including as a fortress, quarry, and even a Christian shrine. Today, it is one of the most iconic symbols of Imperial Rome and a major tourist attraction."
