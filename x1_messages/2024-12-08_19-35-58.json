        "content": "So I've got this problem here about marbles in a bag. There are 6 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles. I need to find the probability that if I pick one marble at random, it's not blue. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what probability is. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are picking any marble that's not blue, and the total outcomes are all the marbles in the bag.\n\nSo, let's find out the total number of marbles. There are 6 red, 4 blue, and 5 green. Adding those up: 6 + 4 + 5 equals 15 marbles in total.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of marbles that are not blue. That would be the red and green marbles combined. So, 6 red plus 5 green equals 11 marbles that are not blue.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a marble that's not blue is the number of non-blue marbles divided by the total number of marbles. That is 11 divided by 15.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? I know that the probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event happening. So, the probability of not picking blue could also be 1 minus the probability of picking blue.\n\nLet me calculate that to check if I get the same answer. The probability of picking a blue marble is the number of blue marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 4 divided by 15. So, 1 minus 4/15 is equal to 15/15 minus 4/15, which is 11/15.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the probability is 11/15.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total number of marbles is indeed 15, and the number of non-blue marbles is 11. So, 11/15 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages to understand it better. 11 divided by 15 is approximately 0.7333, which is about 73.33%. So, there's roughly a 73.33% chance of picking a marble that's not blue.\n\nBut since the question asks for the probability, I should leave it as a fraction unless specified otherwise. And in this case, 11/15 is already in its simplest form.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there any chance that marbles could be added or removed affecting the probability? The problem says \"pick one marble,\" so it's just a single draw without replacement, and no other conditions are mentioned.\n\nSo, I think 11/15 is the correct answer. But to be absolutely sure, let's imagine if I had to pick two marbles, but the question specifies picking only one, so that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use combinations to figure this out. The number of ways to choose one non-blue marble is the number of non-blue marbles, which is 11, and the total number of ways to choose any marble is 15. So, the probability is still 11/15.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier. So, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{15}} \\]"
