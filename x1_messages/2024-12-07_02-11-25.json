        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a class of 25 students, and their average score was 78%. That means the total sum of all their scores is 25 times 78, right? Let me calculate that.\n\n25 multiplied by 78 is:\n\n25 \u00d7 78 = 25 \u00d7 (70 + 8) = (25 \u00d7 70) + (25 \u00d7 8) = 1750 + 200 = 1950.\n\nSo, the total sum of all scores is 1950%.\n\nNow, there was a mistake in recording one student's grade. It was recorded as 48% instead of the correct 84%. That means the total sum was incorrect by the difference between 48% and 84%.\n\nThe difference is:\n\n84% - 48% = 36%.\n\nSo, the total sum should have been 1950% plus 36% to correct the mistake.\n\n1950% + 36% = 1986%.\n\nNow, to find the new average, we need to divide this corrected total sum by the number of students, which is 25.\n\nSo, the new average is:\n\n1986% \u00f7 25.\n\nLet's do that division.\n\n1986 \u00f7 25.\n\nI can calculate this by dividing 1986 by 25.\n\nFirst, 25 times 79 is 1975, because 25 \u00d7 70 = 1750, and 25 \u00d7 9 = 225, so 1750 + 225 = 1975.\n\nSubtracting 1975 from 1986 gives us 11.\n\nSo, 25 \u00d7 79 = 1975, and there's a remainder of 11.\n\nTo express this as a decimal, we can think of 11 divided by 25.\n\n11 \u00f7 25 = 0.44.\n\nTherefore, the new average is 79.44%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n1986 \u00f7 25 = (2000 - 14) \u00f7 25 = (2000 \u00f7 25) - (14 \u00f7 25) = 80 - 0.56 = 79.44%.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the new class average is 79.44%.\n\nBut, in some contexts, it might be expected to round to one decimal place or keep it as is. Given that percentages are often presented with two decimal places, 79.44% seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that percentages are often rounded to the nearest whole number, we might round 79.44% to 79%.\n\nHowever, since the original average was given with a decimal (78%), and the scores have decimals as well, it's likely that the new average should also be presented with decimals.\n\nTherefore, the new class average is 79.44%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{79.44\\%} \\]"
