        "content": "So there's this problem about forming a committee with some specific conditions. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 12 employees in total, and we need to form a committee of 4 members. But there's a twist: the manager insists that she must be on the committee. So, she's basically a mandatory member.\n\nOkay, so if the manager has to be on the committee, that means we already have one member selected: the manager herself. So, out of the 4 spots on the committee, one is already taken.\n\nThat leaves us with 4 - 1 = 3 spots to fill on the committee.\n\nNow, since the manager is already on the committee, we have 12 - 1 = 11 employees left to choose from for the remaining spots.\n\nSo, we need to choose 3 members from these 11 employees.\n\nI recall that when we need to choose a certain number of items from a larger set without regard to the order, we use combinations. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the total number of items to choose from.\n\n- k is the number of items to choose.\n\n- \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, in this case, n = 11 (remaining employees), and k = 3 (spots left on the committee).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nC(11, 3) = 11! / (3!(11 - 3)!) = (11!)/(3! * 8!)\n\nNow, calculating factorials can get messy with large numbers, but I know that factorials have a lot of common terms that can cancel out.\n\nLet's write out the factorials:\n\n11! = 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n\n8! = 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n\nSo, in the expression (11!)/(8!), the 8! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, leaving us with:\n\n11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9\n\nSo, C(11, 3) = (11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9)/(3!)\n\nNow, 3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\nSo, C(11, 3) = (11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9)/6\n\nLet's calculate the numerator first:\n\n11 \u00d7 10 = 110\n\n110 \u00d7 9 = 990\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n990 \u00f7 6 = 165\n\nTherefore, there are 165 ways to choose the remaining 3 members from the 11 employees.\n\nBut wait, since the manager is already on the committee, do we need to consider her in the combinations?\n\nActually, no, because she's already assigned a spot on the committee. So, the total number of ways to form the committee is just the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 members from the 11 employees.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 165.\n\nLet me double-check that I didn't miss anything.\n\nWe have 12 employees, manager must be on the committee, so we fix one spot, and choose the remaining 3 from the 11 left.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as first selecting the manager (1 way), and then choosing 3 more members from the remaining 11 employees (C(11, 3) = 165 ways), so total is 1 \u00d7 165 = 165.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider choosing the manager as one of the four, and then choosing the remaining three from the 11, it's the same.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total number of possible committees without any restrictions, which would be C(12, 4), and then subtract the number of committees that don't include the manager.\n\nBut wait, that should give the same result.\n\nC(12, 4) = 495\n\nNumber of committees without the manager: C(11, 4) = 330\n\nSo, number of committees with the manager: 495 - 330 = 165\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm confident that 165 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the committee can be formed in 165 different ways.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]"
