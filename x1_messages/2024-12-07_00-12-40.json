        "content": "Let's see. I've got this problem here: at a party, every person shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, and there were a total of 66 handshakes. I need to figure out how many people attended the party.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic problem in combinatorics. I remember that the number of handshakes in such a scenario can be calculated using the combination formula, specifically \"n choose 2,\" where n is the number of people. That makes sense because each handshake is a unique pair of people.\n\nSo, the formula for \"n choose 2\" is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2. And according to the problem, this equals 66. Therefore, I can set up the equation:\n\nn(n-1)/2 = 66\n\nNow, I need to solve for n. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nn(n-1) = 132\n\nAlright, so now I have a quadratic equation:\n\nn\u00b2 - n - 132 = 0\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation for n. I can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to -1. Hmm, let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of 132:\n\n1 and 132\n\n2 and 66\n\n3 and 44\n\n4 and 33\n\n6 and 22\n\n11 and 12\n\nLooking at these, 11 and 12 multiply to 132 and they differ by 1. Since one needs to be negative to get the product -132, I can use 12 and -11.\n\nSo, n\u00b2 - 12n + 11n - 132 = 0\n\nCombining like terms: -12n + 11n = -n, which matches the original equation.\n\nTherefore, I can factor this as:\n\n(n - 12)(n + 11) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives me:\n\nn - 12 = 0 \u21d2 n = 12\n\nn + 11 = 0 \u21d2 n = -11\n\nBut n represents the number of people, which can't be negative. So, n = 12.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe I can use another method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the quadratic formula:\n\nn = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 528)] / 2\n\nWait, let's calculate the discriminant:\n\nd = 1 + 528 = 529\n\nAnd \u221a529 = 23\n\nSo, n = [1 \u00b1 23]/2\n\nTaking the positive option:\n\nn = (1 + 23)/2 = 24/2 = 12\n\nAnd the negative option:\n\nn = (1 - 23)/2 = -22/2 = -11\n\nAgain, n = 12 is the valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of summation. Each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, so the total number of handshakes is the sum of the first (n-1) integers for n people.\n\nWait, actually, that's equivalent to the combination formula I used earlier. So, it's consistent.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Suppose I start adding up the handshakes:\n\nIf there are 2 people, 1 handshake.\n\n3 people, 3 handshakes.\n\n4 people, 6 handshakes.\n\n5 people, 10 handshakes.\n\n6 people, 15 handshakes.\n\n7 people, 21 handshakes.\n\n8 people, 28 handshakes.\n\n9 people, 36 handshakes.\n\n10 people, 45 handshakes.\n\n11 people, 55 handshakes.\n\n12 people, 66 handshakes.\n\nAh, there we go. When n = 12, the number of handshakes is 66, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo, all these methods lead me to the same conclusion: there were 12 people at the party.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if n = 12 indeed gives 66 handshakes.\n\nUsing the formula: C(12, 2) = 12*11/2 = 132/2 = 66. Perfect.\n\nAlternatively, if n = 12, then the total number of handshakes is 12 choose 2, which is 66.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12 people attended the party.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. Unless there's some other angle I'm missing, but I don't think so. This seems like a straightforward combinatorics problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
