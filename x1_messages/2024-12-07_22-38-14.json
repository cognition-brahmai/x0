        "content": "Let's break this down. So, John rented a car from this company, and they charge $20 per day for the rental, plus an extra $0.10 for every mile he drives. John drove 150 miles. I need to find out the total amount he paid.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the cost for the miles he drove. The company charges $0.10 per mile, and John drove 150 miles. So, the cost for miles would be 150 miles times $0.10 per mile.\n\nLet me calculate that: 150 miles * $0.10/mile = $15.\n\nSo, the mileage fee is $15.\n\nNow, I need to add the daily rental fee. The rental is $20 per day. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how many days John rented the car. It only mentions the mileage.\n\nHmm, that's tricky. Maybe I can assume he rented it for one day since it doesn't specify. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to calculate the total cost.\n\nAssuming he rented it for one day, the rental fee would be $20.\n\nSo, total cost = rental fee + mileage fee = $20 + $15 = $35.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the rental period is more than one day. The problem says \"rented a car and drove it for 150 miles,\" but doesn't specify the number of days.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the rental period could be multiple days, and the mileage is accumulated over those days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $20 is a one-time fee regardless of the number of days, and then the mileage fee applies.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"$20 per day for renting a car,\" so it's a daily fee.\n\nSince the number of days isn't specified, I think the only way to answer this is to assume he rented it for one day.\n\nOtherwise, without knowing the number of days, I can't calculate the total rental fee.\n\nSo, assuming one day, total cost is $35.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nLet me see if there's a formula or equation I can set up.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- D = number of days rented\n\n- M = miles driven\n\nGiven:\n\n- Rental fee: $20 per day\n\n- Mileage fee: $0.10 per mile\n\n- M = 150 miles\n\nTotal cost, C = (20 * D) + (0.10 * M)\n\nBut since D is not given, and assuming D=1, C = (20 * 1) + (0.10 * 150) = 20 + 15 = $35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider only the mileage fee and a one-time rental fee, but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the $20 is a base fee, and then $0.10 per mile, regardless of days.\n\nSome rental companies have a base fee plus a per-mile charge.\n\nIf that's the case, then total cost is base fee plus mileage fee.\n\nBut the problem says \"$20 per day for renting a car plus an additional fee of $0.10 per mile driven.\"\n\nThis suggests that the $20 is a daily rate, and then there's an extra charge per mile.\n\nGiven that, without knowing the number of days, I can't compute the total rental fee.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem implies that the car was rented for one day.\n\nIn many rental scenarios, especially for short trips, cars are rented by the day.\n\nSo, assuming one day, total cost is $35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $20 is a drop charge or initial fee, and then $0.10 per mile.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"$20 per day,\" which suggests it's a daily rate.\n\nThis ambiguity is making it confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the $20 per day includes a certain number of miles, and anything beyond that is charged at $0.10 per mile.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any included miles.\n\nIt just says \"$20 per day for renting a car plus an additional fee of $0.10 per mile driven.\"\n\nSo, it seems straightforward: $20 per day plus $0.10 for each mile driven.\n\nWith M=150 miles, and assuming D=1 day, C = 20*1 + 0.10*150 = 20 + 15 = $35.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider different numbers of days.\n\nSuppose D=2 days:\n\nC = 20*2 + 0.10*150 = 40 + 15 = $55.\n\nOr D=3 days:\n\nC = 20*3 + 0.10*150 = 60 + 15 = $75.\n\nBut without knowing the number of days, these are just speculative.\n\nGiven that, the most reasonable assumption is that John rented the car for one day, especially since the problem doesn't specify otherwise.\n\nTherefore, total cost is $35.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to express the total cost in terms of the number of days.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as it asks for a specific total amount paid.\n\nHence, assuming one day, the total is $35.\n\nI think that's the best answer given the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
