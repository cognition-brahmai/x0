So, the total number of rooms in all the houses would be:\n\n10 houses \u00d7 5 rooms/house = 50 rooms\n\nNow, each room has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the village is:\n\n50 rooms \u00d7 2 windows/room = 100 windows\n\nThe villagers decided to paint all the windows blue but stopped after painting half of them. So, half of the windows were painted, and the other half were left unpainted.\n\nTherefore, the number of unpainted windows is:\n\n100 windows \u00f7 2 = 50 windows\n\nSo, 50 windows were left unpainted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
