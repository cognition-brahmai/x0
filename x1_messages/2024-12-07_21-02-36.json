The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\n\nGiven that the train travels at an average speed of 90 mph for a distance of 360 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = \\frac{360 \\text{ miles}}{90 \\text{ mph}} \\]\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{time} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, it takes the train 4 hours to complete its journey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
