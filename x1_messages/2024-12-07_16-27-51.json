        "content": "Let's see... I'm a bit rusty on psychology, but I think I can figure this out. So, cognitive psychology, right? I know that psychology has different branches, each focusing on different aspects of human behavior and mental processes. Let me look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The study of mental processes such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking.\" That sounds familiar. I recall that cognitive psychology is all about how we process information, how we think, remember things, perceive the world, and so on. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the primary focus.\n\nOption B mentions: \"The study of observable behavior and its explanation by principles of learning.\" Hmm, that sounds more like behavioral psychology, doesn't it? Behavioral psychologists focus on observable actions and how behaviors are learned through conditioning and reinforcement. So, this doesn't seem to match cognitive psychology.\n\nOption C is: \"The study of how psychological processes affect and can enhance teaching and learning.\" I think this is educational psychology. It's about applying psychological principles to improve education and learning processes. Again, not directly related to cognitive psychology, which is more about the internal mental processes.\n\nOption D says: \"The study of how people and machines interact and the design of safe and easily used machines and environments.\" This sounds like human-computer interaction or ergonomics, maybe. It's more about the practical application of psychology in designing technology and environments that are user-friendly. Not directly about cognitive processes, though there might be some overlap.\n\nOption E is \"None of the above,\" but given that option A seems to fit perfectly, I don't think I need to consider this.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A is the best description of the primary focus of cognitive psychology. It's all about those mental processes like memory, perception, problem-solving, and thinking.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any overlap between cognitive psychology and other fields mentioned in the options?\n\nWell, for example, behavioral psychology focuses on observable behavior, but cognitive psychology delves into the internal processes that lead to behavior. So, while there might be some connections, they are distinct in their approach.\n\nEducational psychology applies psychological principles to education, which could include cognitive processes, but it's broader and more applied in nature.\n\nHuman-computer interaction is more about the design and usability of technology, which again uses principles from cognitive psychology but is a separate field.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option A is the correct answer. Cognitive psychology is primarily concerned with mental processes such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem-solving, creativity, and thinking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
