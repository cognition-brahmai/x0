        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that produces 1200 widgets per day, and each widget weighs 500 grams. We need to find out the total weight of the production per week in kilograms.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many widgets are produced in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, and the factory produces 1200 widgets each day, I can multiply 1200 by 7 to get the weekly production.\n\n1200 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 8400 widgets/week\n\nOkay, so the factory produces 8400 widgets in a week.\n\nNext, each widget weighs 500 grams. To find the total weight, I need to multiply the number of widgets by the weight of each widget.\n\n8400 widgets * 500 grams/widget = 4,200,000 grams\n\nNow, the question asks for the weight in kilograms, not grams. I know that 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams. So, to convert grams to kilograms, I need to divide by 1000.\n\n4,200,000 grams / 1000 = 4200 kilograms\n\nSo, the total production weighs 4200 kilograms per week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could first convert the weight of each widget to kilograms and then multiply by the number of widgets produced in a week.\n\nEach widget weighs 500 grams, which is 0.5 kilograms (since 500 divided by 1000 is 0.5).\n\nThen, the weekly production is 8400 widgets, so:\n\n8400 widgets * 0.5 kg/widget = 4200 kilograms\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. Good, it seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe there's a way to do this by calculating the daily production in kilograms and then multiplying by 7.\n\nDaily production: 1200 widgets * 500 grams/widget = 600,000 grams\n\nConvert to kilograms: 600,000 grams / 1000 = 600 kilograms per day\n\nThen, for a week: 600 kg/day * 7 days/week = 4200 kilograms per week\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me more confidence that 4200 kg is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there anything about the widgets or the production process that could affect the total weight? The problem doesn't mention any waste or defects, so I'll assume all produced widgets are included in the total weight.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"per week,\" and I've used a 7-day week, which is standard. I shouldn't assume a different number of days unless specified.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, my final answer is 4200 kilograms per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4200} \\]"
