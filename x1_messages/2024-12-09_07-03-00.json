        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you want a Java program that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion, right? Alright, let's dive into it.\n\nFirst things first, what's a factorial? Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNow, recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, this means a function calls itself with a simpler version of the original problem.\n\nSo, for factorial, the recursive relation is:\n\nn! = n * (n-1)! \n\nAnd we know that 0! = 1 and 1! = 1. These are our base cases.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Java.\n\nI need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns its factorial. Since we're using recursion, the function will call itself with n-1 until it reaches the base case.\n\nI should also consider that the input is a non-negative integer. So, I need to handle cases where the input is negative by either returning an error message or throwing an exception. But for simplicity, let's assume the input is always non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch out the function:\n\n- Define a method, say, `long factorial(int n)`\n\n- If n is 0 or 1, return 1\n\n- Otherwise, return n multiplied by factorial(n-1)\n\nI'm using long because factorials can get large very quickly, and int might overflow for larger values of n.\n\nWait, but even long has its limits. For example, 20! is way beyond the maximum value of a long. So, maybe I should use BigInteger to handle very large numbers.\n\nBut to keep it simple, let's stick with long for now, and note that it will only work correctly for small values of n.\n\nAlright, so here's a basic structure:\n\n```java\npublic class Factorial {\n\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorial(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int number = 5;\n        System.out.println(\"Factorial of \" + number + \" is: \" + factorial(number));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should work for n where n! fits into a long.\n\nLet me test this with n=5. 5! = 120, which is correct.\n\nWhat about n=0? 0! is 1, which is correct.\n\nn=1? 1! is 1, correct.\n\nn=10? 10! is 3,628,800, which should be fine with long.\n\nn=20? 20! is 2,432,902,008,176,640,000, which is within the range of long.\n\nWait, no. Long's maximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. 20! is 2,432,902,008,176,640,000, which is less than that. So, it should work.\n\nBut actually, let's check:\n\nLet me calculate 20! manually or look it up.\n\n20! is indeed 2,432,902,008,176,640,000, which is within the range of long.\n\nBut what about 21!? 21! = 21 * 20! = 51,090,942,171,709,440,000, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9,223,372,036,854,775,807). So, for n >= 21, we'll have overflow.\n\nTo handle larger factorials, we can use BigInteger.\n\nLet me show you how to do that.\n\nFirst, import BigInteger from java.math.\n\nThen, define the factorial method to return a BigInteger.\n\nInitialize a variable result as BigInteger.ONE.\n\nThen, for loop from 1 to n, multiplying result by i (converted to BigInteger).\n\nBut since you asked for recursion, let's do it recursively with BigInteger.\n\nHere's how it would look:\n\n```java\nimport java.math.BigInteger;\n\npublic class Factorial {\n\n    public static BigInteger factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\n            return BigInteger.ONE;\n        } else {\n            return BigInteger.valueOf(n).multiply(factorial(n - 1));\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int number = 25;\n        System.out.println(\"Factorial of \" + number + \" is: \" + factorial(number));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you can calculate factorial for much larger values of n without worrying about overflow.\n\nBut since you specifically asked for recursion and using long, I'll stick with the first version.\n\nJust remember that it has limitations for larger n.\n\nAlso, in a real-world scenario, you might want to add input validation to ensure n is non-negative.\n\nBut for this example, I'll assume n is always valid.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!\n\n## Final Solution\nTo calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion in Java, you can use the following code:\n\n```java\npublic class Factorial {\n\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorial(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int number = 5;\n        System.out.println(\"Factorial of \" + number + \" is: \" + factorial(number));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Factorial Calculation**:\n   - The `factorial` method takes an integer `n` and returns its factorial.\n   - If `n` is 0 or 1, it returns 1 (base case).\n   - Otherwise, it returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1` (recursive case).\n\n2. **Main Method**:\n   - The `main` method tests the `factorial` method with `number = 5`.\n   - It prints the result: \"Factorial of 5 is: 120\".\n\nThis approach uses recursion to calculate the factorial, which is a direct translation of the mathematical definition. Note that for larger values of `n`, the result may exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a `long`. In such cases, consider using `BigInteger` for unlimited integer size."
