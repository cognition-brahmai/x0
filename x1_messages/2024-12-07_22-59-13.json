        "content": "So I've got this probability question here: In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what's the probability of drawing four cards with each card being a different suit? Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. So, if I'm drawing four cards and each has to be from a different suit, that means I need one heart, one diamond, one club, and one spade, but not necessarily in that order.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw four cards from 52, and the favorable outcomes are the ways to draw one card from each suit.\n\nLet me first figure out the total number of ways to draw four cards from 52. That's simply the combination of 52 cards taken 4 at a time, which is denoted as C(52,4). The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, C(52,4) = 52! / (4!(52-4)!) = (52*51*50*49) / (4*3*2*1) = (52*51*50*49) / 24.\n\nI can calculate that later, but for now, let's keep it as C(52,4).\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, I need to pick one card from each of the four suits. Since there are 13 cards in each suit, the number of ways to pick one card from hearts is 13, similarly for diamonds, clubs, and spades.\n\nSo, the number of ways to pick one card from each suit is 13 (hearts) * 13 (diamonds) * 13 (clubs) * 13 (spades) = 13^4.\n\nWait a minute, but this assumes that I'm picking one from each suit in a specific order, whereas in reality, the order doesn't matter. For example, picking a heart first, then a diamond, then a club, then a spade is the same as picking a spade first, then a club, then a diamond, then a heart.\n\nSo, I need to adjust for the fact that the order in which I pick the cards doesn't matter. Since there are four suits, the number of ways to arrange four suits is 4!, which is 24.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable combinations is 13^4, and since order doesn't matter, I don't need to multiply by 24. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nCombinations don't consider order, so when I calculate C(52,4), it's the number of unordered sets of four cards. Similarly, when I calculate the number of ways to pick one from each suit, I should also consider it as unordered.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is indeed 13^4, because I'm choosing one card from each suit, and the order doesn't matter.\n\nTherefore, the probability P is:\n\nP = (13^4) / C(52,4)\n\nNow, let's calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 13^4:\n\n13^2 = 169\n\n13^4 = 169^2\n\n169 * 169.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n169 * 160 = 27040\n\n169 * 9 = 1521\n\nSo, 27040 + 1521 = 28561\n\nSo, 13^4 = 28561\n\nNow, calculate C(52,4):\n\nC(52,4) = (52*51*50*49) / 24\n\nFirst, calculate numerator:\n\n52 * 51 = 2652\n\n2652 * 50 = 132600\n\n132600 * 49 = 650000 - wait, let's compute it properly.\n\n52 * 51 = 2652\n\n2652 * 50 = 132600\n\n132600 * 49.\n\n49 is 50 - 1, so 132600*50 = 6,630,000\n\nThen, 132600*1 = 132,600\n\nSo, 6,630,000 - 132,600 = 6,497,400\n\nNow, denominator is 24.\n\nSo, C(52,4) = 6,497,400 / 24\n\nLet's divide 6,497,400 by 24.\n\nFirst, 6,497,400 \u00f7 24.\n\n24 * 270,000 = 6,480,000\n\nSubtract: 6,497,400 - 6,480,000 = 17,400\n\n24 * 725 = 17,400\n\nSo, 270,725\n\nTherefore, C(52,4) = 270,725\n\nNow, P = 28,561 / 270,725\n\nLet's simplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, check if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 13.\n\n13^4 is 28,561, and 13^2 is 169, 13^3 is 2,197, 13^4 is 28,561.\n\nLet's see if 270,725 is divisible by 13.\n\nDivide 270,725 by 13.\n\n13 * 20,000 = 260,000\n\nSubtract: 270,725 - 260,000 = 10,725\n\n13 * 825 = 10,725\n\nSo, 270,725 \u00f7 13 = 20,825\n\nSimilarly, 28,561 \u00f7 13 = 2,197\n\nSo, P = 2,197 / 20,825\n\nCan this be simplified further?\n\nLet's check if 2,197 and 20,825 have any common factors.\n\n13 * 13 * 13 = 2,197, since 13^3 = 2,197.\n\nSimilarly, 20,825 \u00f7 13:\n\n13 * 1,600 = 20,800\n\nSubtract: 20,825 - 20,800 = 25\n\nSo, 13 * 1,601.923, which is not an integer.\n\nWait, let's do the division properly.\n\n20,825 \u00f7 13.\n\n13 * 1,600 = 20,800\n\nRemaining 25.\n\n25 \u00f7 13 is approximately 1.923\n\nSo, 20,825 \u00f7 13 = 1,601.923, which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, 2,197 and 20,825 have no common factors other than 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2,197 / 20,825.\n\nLet's convert this to a decimal for better understanding.\n\n2,197 \u00f7 20,825 \u2248 0.1055\n\nSo, approximately 10.55%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing four cards with each being from a different suit is about 10.55%.\n\nWait a second, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 13^4 is indeed 28,561.\n\nC(52,4) = 270,725, as calculated.\n\nThen, P = 28,561 / 270,725 = 2,197 / 20,825 \u2248 0.1055 or 10.55%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem to verify the result.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the number of ways to choose one card from each suit and then divide by the total number of ways to choose any four cards.\n\nAlternatively, think about it step by step:\n\n- The first card can be any suit, so probability is 52/52 = 1.\n\n- The second card must be a different suit from the first. Since there are 39 cards of the remaining three suits out of 51 remaining cards, the probability is 39/51.\n\n- The third card must be from one of the two remaining suits. There are 26 such cards out of 50 remaining cards, so probability is 26/50.\n\n- The fourth card must be from the remaining suit, which has 13 cards out of 49 remaining cards, so probability is 13/49.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability is:\n\nP = (52/52) * (39/51) * (26/50) * (13/49)\n\nSimplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, 52/52 = 1.\n\nThen, 39/51 = 13/17 (dividing numerator and denominator by 3).\n\nNext, 26/50 = 13/25 (dividing by 2).\n\nFinally, 13/49 remains as is.\n\nSo, P = 1 * (13/17) * (13/25) * (13/49)\n\nNow, multiply these fractions:\n\nNumerator: 13 * 13 * 13 = 13^3 = 2,197\n\nDenominator: 17 * 25 * 49\n\nCalculate denominator:\n\n17 * 25 = 425\n\n425 * 49.\n\n400 * 49 = 19,600\n\n25 * 49 = 1,225\n\nSo, 19,600 + 1,225 = 20,825\n\nTherefore, P = 2,197 / 20,825 \u2248 0.1055 or 10.55%.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of permutations.\n\nThe number of ways to select one card from each suit, considering order, is 13^4 * 4!.\n\nWait, no, that would be if order matters.\n\nBut in combinations, order doesn't matter.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the combination approach I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of multinomial coefficients.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one card from each suit is C(13,1)^4 = 13^4.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any four cards is C(52,4).\n\nSo, P = (13^4) / C(52,4) = 28,561 / 270,725 \u2248 0.1055 or 10.55%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the first card can be any suit, then the second card must be one of the remaining three suits, and so on.\n\nThis is similar to the step-by-step probability I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that after choosing the first card, there are 51 cards left, with 39 of them being from a different suit than the first card.\n\nThen, after choosing the second card from a different suit, there are 50 cards left, with 26 from the remaining two suits.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this seems similar to the step-by-step probability approach I already used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the total number of ways to choose one card from each suit and divide by the total number of ways to choose any four cards.\n\nThis is essentially what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that there are four suits, and I need to choose one card from each suit, so the number of favorable outcomes is 13^4, and the total number of outcomes is C(52,4).\n\nWait, but I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the problem differently.\n\nSuppose I assign each suit to one of the four cards.\n\nThere are 4! = 24 ways to assign the suits to the four positions.\n\nThen, for each position, there are 13 choices for the card.\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes would be 4! * 13^4.\n\nBut wait, that would be if order matters.\n\nBut in card drawing, order may or may not matter, depending on the context.\n\nIn this problem, since it's about drawing four cards and having each be a different suit, without specifying the order, it's probably combinations, not permutations.\n\nTherefore, I think the initial approach is correct: P = (13^4) / C(52,4) \u2248 0.1055 or 10.55%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact probability to verify.\n\nBut since this is a standard probability problem, and my calculations seem consistent, I think this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing four cards with each being from a different suit is approximately 10.55%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2197}{20825} \\approx 0.1055 \\text{ or } 10.55\\%} \\]"
