        "content": "No, porcupines cannot shoot their quills. This is a common misconception. Porcupines have barbed quills that are loosely attached to their bodies, and when threatened, they raise their quills and swing their backsides towards the predator. If the predator makes contact, the quills detach easily and become embedded in the predator's skin. The barbs on the quills make them difficult to remove, which deters further attacks."
