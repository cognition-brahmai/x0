        "content": "So the garden is rectangular, with a length of 30 feet and a width of 20 feet. The owner wants to build a fence around the entire garden, but with an additional 2 feet on each side for a walking path. I need to find out what the perimeter of this fenced area will be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"additional 2 feet on each side\" means. Since it's a rectangle, there are two lengths and two widths. If we're adding 2 feet to each side, that means both the length and the width will increase by 2 feet on each end.\n\nWait, actually, since it's a walking path around the entire garden, the fence will need to encompass the garden plus the path around all four sides. So, for each side, the path adds 2 feet beyond the garden's dimensions.\n\nLet me visualize this. The garden is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. If we're adding a 2-foot path on all sides, then the total length of the fenced area should be the garden's length plus 2 feet on one end and 2 feet on the other end, so that's 30 + 2 + 2 = 34 feet.\n\nSimilarly, the width would be 20 + 2 + 2 = 24 feet.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If the path is 2 feet wide on all sides, then on each side of the garden, the path extends out by 2 feet. So, for the length, which is 30 feet, adding 2 feet to each end would indeed make it 30 + 4 = 34 feet.\n\nSimilarly, for the width, 20 feet plus 2 feet on each side, so 20 + 4 = 24 feet.\n\nOkay, so the fenced area is a rectangle that is 34 feet in length and 24 feet in width.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of this rectangle, I use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2*(length + width).\n\nSo, P = 2*(34 + 24) = 2*(58) = 116 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\n34 plus 24 is 58, and 2 times 58 is indeed 116.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fenced area is 116 feet.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I accounted for everything correctly.\n\nThe original garden is 30 feet by 20 feet. Adding a 2-foot path on all sides means that the fence has to be built 2 feet outside of the garden's boundaries on all sides.\n\nSo, for the length: 30 feet (garden) + 4 feet (2 feet on each end) = 34 feet.\n\nFor the width: 20 feet (garden) + 4 feet (2 feet on each side) = 24 feet.\n\nThen, the perimeter is correctly calculated as 2*(34 + 24) = 2*58 = 116 feet.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{116} \\]"
