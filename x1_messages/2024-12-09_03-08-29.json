        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100, and the postman delivers mail to different houses each day of the week based on the house numbers being multiples of certain numbers.\n\n- On Mondays, he delivers to houses with even numbers, which are multiples of 2.\n\n- On Tuesdays, multiples of 3.\n\n- On Wednesdays, multiples of 4.\n\n- And this continues until Sunday, where he delivers to multiples of 8.\n\nSo, the question is, how many houses receive mail every day from Monday to Sunday?\n\nTo find out how many houses receive mail every day, we need to find the houses whose numbers are multiples of all the numbers that the postman uses throughout the week. That is, the houses that are multiples of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the sequence. The problem says the pattern continues until Sunday when he delivers to houses whose numbers are multiples of 8. So, starting from Monday to Sunday, that's 7 days. The multiples are of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nSo, the postman delivers to houses that are multiples of 2 on Monday, 3 on Tuesday, 4 on Wednesday, 5 on Thursday, 6 on Friday, 7 on Saturday, and 8 on Sunday.\n\nTherefore, to receive mail every day, a house number must be a multiple of all these numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nTo find such houses, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers first, because a number that is a multiple of all these numbers must be a multiple of their LCM.\n\nSo, let's find the LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nFirst, factorize each number:\n\n- 2: 2\n\n- 3: 3\n\n- 4: 2^2\n\n- 5: 5\n\n- 6: 2 * 3\n\n- 7: 7\n\n- 8: 2^3\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations.\n\n- For 2: highest power is 2^3 (from 8)\n\n- For 3: highest power is 3 (from 3 or 6)\n\n- For 5: highest power is 5 (from 5)\n\n- For 7: highest power is 7 (from 7)\n\nSo, LCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7\n\nCalculate that:\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n8 * 3 = 24\n\n24 * 5 = 120\n\n120 * 7 = 840\n\nSo, the LCM is 840.\n\nNow, we need to find how many houses between 1 and 100 are multiples of 840.\n\nBut 840 is greater than 100, so there are no houses between 1 and 100 that are multiples of 840.\n\nTherefore, there are 0 houses that receive mail every day.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nIs it possible that a smaller number could be a multiple of all these numbers? Well, since the LCM is 840, and it's greater than 100, no number within 1 to 100 can be a multiple of all the numbers from 2 to 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the days or misidentified the multiples.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem.\n\n\"Every morning, the postman delivers mail to each house. However, on Mondays, he only delivers to houses with even numbers. On Tuesdays, he delivers to houses whose numbers are multiples of 3. On Wednesdays, he delivers to houses whose numbers are multiples of 4. This pattern continues until Sunday when he delivers to houses whose numbers are multiples of 8.\"\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n- Monday: multiples of 2\n\n- Tuesday: multiples of 3\n\n- Wednesday: multiples of 4\n\n- Thursday: multiples of 5\n\n- Friday: multiples of 6\n\n- Saturday: multiples of 7\n\n- Sunday: multiples of 8\n\nYes, that's 7 days, from Monday to Sunday.\n\nNow, to receive mail every day, a house must be a multiple of all these numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nFinding the LCM of these numbers is the correct approach to find the smallest number that is a multiple of all of them.\n\nWe did that calculation, and LCM is 840, which is greater than 100.\n\nTherefore, no house between 1 and 100 can be a multiple of 840.\n\nHence, the answer should be 0.\n\nBut maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for houses that receive mail every day they are supposed to, meaning houses that are multiples of the respective numbers for each day.\n\nBut in the context of receiving mail every day from Monday to Sunday, it still boils down to being a multiple of all those numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the postman delivers mail to all houses every day, but with the additional constraints based on the day of the week.\n\nBut the problem states that \"every morning, the postman delivers mail to each house.\" Then, \"however,\" on Mondays, he only delivers to houses with even numbers, and so on for other days.\n\nSo, it seems like the \"however\" is introducing exceptions to the general rule of delivering to all houses.\n\nTherefore, on each specific day, he only delivers to the specified subset of houses.\n\nSo, to receive mail every day, a house must be in all those subsets.\n\nThus, it must be a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nHence, the LCM approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about how many houses receive mail at least once during the week.\n\nBut no, it specifically asks for houses that receive mail every day.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.\n\nBut let's consider if there is any overlap or if I missed something.\n\nFor example, is there any house number between 1 and 100 that is a multiple of all these numbers?\n\nWell, since 840 is the LCM and it's greater than 100, no house number within 1 to 100 can satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the LCM.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n- 2: 2\n\n- 3: 3\n\n- 4: 2^2\n\n- 5: 5\n\n- 6: 2 * 3\n\n- 7: 7\n\n- 8: 2^3\n\nTake the highest powers: 2^3, 3, 5, 7.\n\nSo, LCM = 8 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 8 * 3 = 24\n\n24 * 5 = 120\n\n120 * 7 = 840\n\nYes, LCM is indeed 840.\n\nTherefore, no house number between 1 and 100 is a multiple of 840.\n\nHence, the answer is 0.\n\nBut perhaps the question is misphrased or misinterpreted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the postman delivers mail to all houses every day, but only to the specified subsets on each day.\n\nIn that case, every house receives mail on the days corresponding to their number's multiples.\n\nBut the question asks for houses that receive mail every day, which would still require the house number to be in all those subsets, meaning multiples of all those numbers.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all these numbers.\n\nBut in fact, that is the definition of LCM.\n\nSo, I think the answer is indeed 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
