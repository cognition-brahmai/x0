        "content": "I'm here to help you develop a Python FastAPI application with CRUD endpoints for managing products and integrate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. Let's get started!\n\nFirst, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. I recommend using Python 3.7 or higher. You'll also need to install FastAPI and Uvicorn. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python, and Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server.\n\nYou can install FastAPI and Uvicorn using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install fastapi uvicorn\n```\n\nNow, let's create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir product_api\ncd product_api\n```\n\nInside this directory, create a new Python file, let's say `main.py`, which will contain your FastAPI application.\n\nOpen `main.py` in your favorite code editor and start by importing FastAPI:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n```\n\nThis sets up a basic FastAPI application.\n\nNext, we'll define a simple in-memory store for our products since we're not connecting to a database in this example. In a real-world scenario, you'd probably use a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.\n\nLet's create a list to store our products:\n\n```python\nproducts = []\n```\n\nEach product will have an ID, a name, and a description. To handle IDs uniquely, we'll keep track of the next available ID.\n\n```python\nnext_id = 1\n```\n\nNow, let's define a Pydantic model for the product. Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library in Python, and it's used in FastAPI for data validation and serialization.\n\nAdd the following code to define the Product model:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass Product(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    description: str\n```\n\nThis model will be used for request bodies and response models.\n\n### Creating Products\n\nFirst, we'll create an endpoint to create a new product.\n\nDefine a POST endpoint:\n\n```python\n@app.post(\"/products/\", response_model=Product)\ndef create_product(name: str, description: str):\n    global next_id\n    product = Product(id=next_id, name=name, description=description)\n    products.append(product)\n    next_id += 1\n    return product\n```\n\nThis endpoint accepts the name and description as parameters, creates a new product with a unique ID, adds it to the products list, and returns the created product.\n\n### Reading Products\n\nNext, let's create endpoints to read products.\n\n1. **Get all products:**\n\n```python\n@app.get(\"/products/\", response_model=list[Product])\ndef read_products():\n    return products\n```\n\n2. **Get a single product by ID:**\n\n```python\n@app.get(\"/products/{product_id}\", response_model=Product)\ndef read_product(product_id: int):\n    for product in products:\n        if product.id == product_id:\n            return product\n    return {\"error\": \"Product not found\"}\n```\n\n### Updating Products\n\nNow, let's create an endpoint to update an existing product.\n\n```python\n@app.put(\"/products/{product_id}\", response_model=Product)\ndef update_product(product_id: int, name: str, description: str):\n    for product in products:\n        if product.id == product_id:\n            product.name = name\n            product.description = description\n            return product\n    return {\"error\": \"Product not found\"}\n```\n\nThis endpoint allows updating the name and description of a product by providing its ID.\n\n### Deleting Products\n\nFinally, create an endpoint to delete a product.\n\n```python\n@app.delete(\"/products/{product_id}\", response_model=dict)\ndef delete_product(product_id: int):\n    global products\n    products = [product for product in products if product.id != product_id]\n    return {\"message\": \"Product deleted\"}\n```\n\nThis endpoint removes a product from the list based on its ID.\n\n### Running the API\n\nTo run your FastAPI application, use Uvicorn:\n\n```bash\nuvicorn main:app --reload\n```\n\nThis command starts the server, and the `--reload` flag enables auto-reload, which is handy during development.\n\nOpen your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to see the automatically generated Swagger UI documentation for your API.\n\n### Summary\n\nYou've now created a simple FastAPI application with CRUD operations for managing products and integrated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. This should give you a solid foundation to build upon. If you need to connect to a database or add more features, FastAPI has extensive documentation and a growing community to support you.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
