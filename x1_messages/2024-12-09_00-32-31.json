        "content": "So I need to calculate the area of a triangle where the base is 12 cm and the height is 15 cm. I remember there's a formula for this, but I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that the area of a triangle is given by half the product of its base and height. So, the formula should be:\n\nArea = (base \u00d7 height) / 2\n\nYes, that sounds right. To make sure, I can look it up, but since I'm supposed to reason through this, I'll proceed with this formula.\n\nNow, the base is 12 cm and the height is 15 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, I get:\n\nArea = (12 cm \u00d7 15 cm) / 2\n\nAlright, next step is to multiply the base and height.\n\n12 multiplied by 15. Let's see, 10 times 15 is 150, and 2 times 15 is 30, so total is 150 + 30 = 180.\n\nSo, 12 cm \u00d7 15 cm = 180 cm\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to divide this by 2 to get the area of the triangle.\n\n180 divided by 2 is 90.\n\nTherefore, the area is 90 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my multiplication and division.\n\n12 times 15 is indeed 180, and half of 180 is 90. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently. Maybe I can visualize the triangle as half of a parallelogram or a rectangle.\n\nIf I have a rectangle with base 12 cm and height 15 cm, its area would be 12 \u00d7 15 = 180 cm\u00b2. Since a triangle is half of that, the area would be 90 cm\u00b2. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its base and height. The formula is indeed (base \u00d7 height) / 2, so I'm confident now that 90 cm\u00b2 is the correct area.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other formula I could use to verify this.\n\nI know that for right-angled triangles, if the base and height are the two perpendicular sides, the area is the same as what I've calculated. But in this case, I don't know if the triangle is right-angled or not. Maybe it's an acute or obtuse triangle.\n\nHowever, the formula (base \u00d7 height)/2 works for any triangle, regardless of its angles, as long as the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex.\n\nSo, in this problem, since they've provided the base and the height, I can directly use this formula without worrying about the type of triangle.\n\nTherefore, the area is definitely 90 cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, just one more thing. I should make sure that the units are consistent. Both the base and height are in centimeters, so their product is in square centimeters, and dividing by 2 doesn't change the units. So, 90 cm\u00b2 is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The area of the triangle is 90 square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90 \\text{ cm}^2} \\]"
