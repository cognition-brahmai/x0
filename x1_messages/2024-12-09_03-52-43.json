        "content": "So, in this class, there are 30 students in total. Out of these, 18 are boys and 12 are girls. Now, among the boys, 6 wear glasses, and among the girls, 4 wear glasses. We need to find out the probability that if we pick any student at random from this class, that student wears glasses.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out how many students in total wear glasses. So, if 6 boys wear glasses and 4 girls wear glasses, then the total number of students who wear glasses is 6 plus 4, which is 10.\n\nNow, the probability is probably going to be the number of students who wear glasses divided by the total number of students, right? So, that would be 10 divided by 30. But I should probably simplify that fraction.\n\n10 divided by 30 is the same as 1 divided by 3, because both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10. So, the probability is one-third.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this. Like, could I consider the probability separately for boys and girls and then combine them?\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student is a boy is 18 out of 30, which is 18/30, and the probability that a boy wears glasses is 6 out of 18, which is 6/18. Similarly, the probability that a randomly selected student is a girl is 12 out of 30, which is 12/30, and the probability that a girl wears glasses is 4 out of 12, which is 4/12.\n\nIf I use the law of total probability, the total probability that a student wears glasses is the probability of selecting a boy times the probability that the boy wears glasses, plus the probability of selecting a girl times the probability that the girl wears glasses.\n\nSo, that would be (18/30 * 6/18) + (12/30 * 4/12).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 18/30 * 6/18.\n\n18/30 simplifies to 3/5, and 6/18 simplifies to 1/3. So, 3/5 * 1/3 is 1/5.\n\nNext, 12/30 * 4/12.\n\n12/30 simplifies to 2/5, and 4/12 simplifies to 1/3. So, 2/5 * 1/3 is 2/15.\n\nNow, adding 1/5 and 2/15.\n\nTo add them, I need a common denominator, which is 15. So, 1/5 is 3/15, and 2/15 remains 2/15. So, 3/15 + 2/15 is 5/15, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nSo, again, I get the same answer, which is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected student wears glasses is one-third.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of percentages.\n\nOne-third is approximately 0.333, which is about 33.3%.\n\nSo, roughly, there's a 33.3% chance that a randomly selected student wears glasses.\n\nAlternatively, since there are 10 students who wear glasses out of 30, and 10 divided by 30 is indeed one-third.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
