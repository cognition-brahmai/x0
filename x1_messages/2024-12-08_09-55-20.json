The company was founded by Ole Kirk Christiansen, a carpenter who started making wooden toys in the 1930s. The name \"Lego\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" which means \"play well.\"\n\nLego bricks are known for their interlocking design, which allows them to be connected in various ways to create a wide range of structures and models. Over the years, Lego has expanded its product line to include themed sets, minifigures, and even video games.\n\nToday, Lego is one of the most recognizable toy brands in the world, enjoyed by children and adults alike for their creativity, versatility, and durability."
