        "content": "So there's this problem about a family gathering where 15 people are there, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. The question is, how many handshakes happen in total?\n\nAlright, let's try to figure this out. I think the best way to approach this is to consider that every person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. So, for example, if there were only 2 people, there would be just 1 handshake. If there were 3 people, there would be 3 handshakes, right? Because each person shakes hands with the other two.\n\nWait, actually, with 3 people, it's 3 handshakes: A shakes hands with B, A shakes hands with C, and B shakes hands with C. So, 3 handshakes in total.\n\nNow, with 4 people, it would be A with B, A with C, A with D, B with C, B with D, and C with D. That's 6 handshakes.\n\nI see a pattern here. With each additional person, the number of handshakes increases. But I need a general formula for 15 people.\n\nLet me think about this systematically. If there are n people, and each shakes hands with every other person exactly once, then the total number of handshakes is equal to the number of unique pairs of people.\n\nWait a minute, that sounds like combinations. In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items out of n without regard to order is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!)\n\nSo, for n people, the number of handshakes is C(n, 2).\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier examples.\n\nFor n = 2:\n\nC(2, 2) = 2! / (2! * (2 - 2)!) = 1, which matches.\n\nFor n = 3:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3 - 2)!) = 6 / (2 * 1) = 3, which is correct.\n\nFor n = 4:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = 24 / (2 * 2) = 6, which is right.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, applying this to n = 15:\n\nC(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * (15 - 2)!) = (15! ) / (2! * 13!) )\n\nBut calculating 15! is a big number, and it's cumbersome. Is there a simpler way to compute this?\n\nWait, I recall that factorials in combinations often cancel out nicely. Let's see:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)! )\n\nSo, C(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * 13!) )\n\nWe can write 15! as 15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13!)\n\nSo, C(15, 2) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13!) / (2! * 13!) )\n\nThe 13! terms cancel out:\n\n= (15 \u00d7 14) / (2! )\n\nAnd 2! is 2, so:\n\n= (15 \u00d7 14) / 2\n\nNow, 15 \u00d7 14 is 210, and 210 divided by 2 is 105.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 105.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this reasoning to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: for n people, each shaking hands with every other person exactly once, the total number of handshakes is C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 15:\n\nC(15, 2) = 15 \u00d7 14 / 2 = 15 \u00d7 7 = 105.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each person shaking hands with 14 other people, but since each handshake involves two people, we would count each handshake twice if we simply did 15 \u00d7 14. Therefore, we need to divide by 2 to get the correct number of unique handshakes.\n\nSo, total handshakes = (15 \u00d7 14) / 2 = 105.\n\nThis matches the combination formula result.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is 105.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
