        "content": "So I've got this math problem here: (4^2 + 9) / (3 * 5 - 12). Hmm, let's see how to tackle this. I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, I'll handle what's inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 4^2 + 9.\n\nI need to calculate the exponent first, so 4^2 is 16. Then add 9, which gives me 25.\n\nSo the numerator is 25.\n\nNow, the denominator: 3 * 5 - 12.\n\nMultiplication comes before subtraction, so 3 * 5 is 15, then subtract 12, which gives me 3.\n\nSo the denominator is 3.\n\nNow, I've got 25 divided by 3, which is approximately 8.333...\n\nBut let's check if I did this correctly.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that I handled the operations in the right order.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIn the numerator: 4^2 + 9.\n\n4^2 is indeed 16, and 16 + 9 is 25. That seems correct.\n\nIn the denominator: 3 * 5 - 12.\n\nMultiplication first: 3 * 5 is 15.\n\nThen subtraction: 15 - 12 is 3. That's correct.\n\nSo, 25 divided by 3 is approximately 8.333..., or more precisely, 8 and one-third.\n\nBut, considering that the original numbers are integers, maybe it's better to leave it as a fraction: 25/3.\n\nAlternatively, if this is a mathematical expression that should result in an integer, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nIs there any possibility that the denominator should be zero, which would make the expression undefined?\n\nLet's calculate the denominator again: 3 * 5 - 12.\n\n3 * 5 is 15, minus 12 is 3.\n\nSo, no, the denominator is not zero; it's 3.\n\nTherefore, the expression evaluates to 25 divided by 3.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nUnless... wait, maybe I should consider the possibility that the operations inside the parentheses need to be evaluated differently.\n\nBut no, parentheses are for grouping, and I've already calculated the expressions inside them correctly.\n\nSo, final answer is 25/3 or approximately 8.333...\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{3}} \\]"
