        "content": "So there are 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in a box, making a total of 10 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random, both of them will be red.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to pick 2 balls out of 10. That sounds like a combination problem, where order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 10 is C(10, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, there are 45 possible pairs of balls that can be picked.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick 2 red balls out of the 4 red balls available.\n\nAgain, this is a combination problem: C(4, 2).\n\nCalculating C(4, 2):\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4 - 2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2!)) = (4 \u00d7 3) / 2 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to pick 2 red balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 6 / 45.\n\nSimplifying that fraction: 6 \u00f7 3 = 2, and 45 \u00f7 3 = 15, so it's 2/15.\n\nWait, but I can double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of sequential probabilities.\n\nThe probability that the first ball picked is red is 4 out of 10, since there are 4 red balls and 10 total balls.\n\nSo, P(first red) = 4/10.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, there are now 3 red balls left and 9 balls in total.\n\nSo, P(second red | first red) = 3/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is P(first red) \u00d7 P(second red | first red) = (4/10) \u00d7 (3/9).\n\nCalculating that: (4/10) \u00d7 (3/9) = (4 \u00d7 3) / (10 \u00d7 9) = 12 / 90.\n\nSimplifying 12/90: divide numerator and denominator by 6, which gives 2/15.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result: 2/15.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total number of ways to pick two red balls in sequence, but since the order doesn't matter in this problem, the combination approach is more straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the sequential approach, order matters, so I need to make sure I'm comparing apples to apples.\n\nActually, in the sequential approach, even though I consider the first and second pick, since the problem doesn't care about order, the result should still be the same.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider sequences, then I need to consider that there are 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 ways to pick two red balls in order, and 10 \u00d7 9 = 90 total ways to pick two balls in order.\n\nSo, 12/90 simplifies to 2/15 again.\n\nSo, all methods confirm that the probability is 2/15.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked are red is 2/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{15}} \\]"
