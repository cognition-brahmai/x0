        "content": "Okay, I've got this system of equations to solve using the substitution method. The equations are:\n\n1. \\( y = 2x - 3 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3x + y = 5 \\)\n\nI know that the substitution method means I'll plug one equation into the other to solve for one variable first, and then use that to find the other variable. Since the first equation already has y expressed in terms of x, that seems like a good place to start.\n\nSo, I'll take the expression for y from the first equation, which is \\( y = 2x - 3 \\), and substitute that into the second equation wherever there's a y. That should allow me to solve for x.\n\nSubstituting y in the second equation:\n\n\\( 3x + (2x - 3) = 5 \\)\n\nNow, I can combine like terms:\n\n\\( 3x + 2x - 3 = 5 \\)\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n\\( 5x - 3 = 5 \\)\n\nNext, I'll add 3 to both sides to isolate the terms with x:\n\n\\( 5x - 3 + 3 = 5 + 3 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( 5x = 8 \\)\n\nNow, I'll divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{8}{5} \\)\n\nAlright, so I have x equals 8/5. Now, I need to find y. Since I have the expression for y from the first equation, I can just plug in the value of x into that.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( y = 2(\\frac{8}{5}) - 3 \\)\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nFirst, \\( 2 \\times \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{16}{5} \\)\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{16}{5} - 3 \\). To subtract, I need a common denominator. 3 is the same as \\( \\frac{15}{5} \\), so:\n\n\\( \\frac{16}{5} - \\frac{15}{5} = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n\nTherefore, y equals 1/5.\n\nSo, the solution to the system is x = 8/5 and y = 1/5.\n\nTo make sure this is correct, I should plug these values back into both original equations to check if they hold true.\n\nFirst, plug into equation 1:\n\n\\( y = 2x - 3 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{5} = 2(\\frac{8}{5}) - 3 \\)\n\nWe already did this calculation and it checks out.\n\nNow, plug into equation 2:\n\n\\( 3x + y = 5 \\)\n\n\\( 3(\\frac{8}{5}) + \\frac{1}{5} = 5 \\)\n\nCalculate \\( 3 \\times \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{24}{5} \\)\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{24}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{25}{5} = 5 \\)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the solution is x = 8/5 and y = 1/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{1}{5} \\right)} \\]"
