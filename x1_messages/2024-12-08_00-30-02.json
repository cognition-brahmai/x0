None suffer to have me, but do from my lack.\" Hmm, weakening men for hours each day could refer to something that makes people tired or less energetic during those times. Strange visions while you are away might mean dreaming, since dreams can be surreal and happen when we're asleep. Taking someone by night and giving them back by day sounds like sleep again, since we sleep at night and wake up during the day. And the last line says that no one suffers from having me, but they do from my lack. So, having sleep is normal and not a problem, but lacking sleep can cause suffering.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like the answer is sleep. But let's double-check. Does sleep weaken all men for hours each day? Well, during sleep, people are inactive and their physical abilities are dormant, so in that sense, yes. Strange visions while away could be dreams. Sleep takes us by night, and we wake up by day. And indeed, lacking sleep causes suffering, while having sleep is natural and not a problem.\n\nSo, I think the answer is sleep."
