        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden that measures 30 feet by 50 feet. The plan is to place fence posts every 10 feet along the perimeter. I need to figure out how many posts will be needed in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the total perimeter of the garden since the fence is going around it. For a rectangle, the perimeter P is calculated as P = 2*(length + width). Here, the length is 50 feet and the width is 30 feet. So, P = 2*(50 + 30) = 2*80 = 160 feet. That means the total perimeter is 160 feet.\n\nNow, if I'm placing posts every 10 feet, I can think of dividing the perimeter into segments of 10 feet each. So, the number of posts would be the perimeter divided by the distance between posts, right? So, 160 feet / 10 feet per post = 16 posts.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's consider whether that makes sense. If I divide the perimeter into 16 segments of 10 feet each, that should cover the entire 160 feet. But in fencing, sometimes the way posts are placed might require an extra post at the corners or something like that.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Let's consider the rectangle has two sides of 50 feet and two sides of 30 feet.\n\nStarting from one corner, I place a post at that corner. Then, along the 50-foot side, if I place posts every 10 feet, how many posts will there be on that side?\n\nWell, starting at 0 feet, then 10 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet, 40 feet, and 50 feet. So, that's 6 posts on one 50-foot side.\n\nSimilarly, on the adjacent 30-foot side, starting from the corner, posts at 0 feet, 10 feet, 20 feet, and 30 feet. So, 4 posts on that side.\n\nWait, but the corner posts are shared between two sides. So, if I count 6 posts on the 50-foot side including the corner posts, and 4 on the 30-foot side including the corner posts, but the corner posts are counted twice if I just add them up.\n\nSo, to avoid double-counting the corner posts, I need to subtract the overlapping posts.\n\nLet me try to calculate it more carefully.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of posts on the long sides (50 feet each):\n\nEach long side has posts at 0 feet, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 feet. So, 6 posts per long side.\n\nBut the two long sides share two corner posts, so total for both long sides: 6*2 - 2 = 10 posts.\n\nSimilarly, for the short sides (30 feet each):\n\nEach short side has posts at 0, 10, 20, 30 feet. So, 4 posts per short side.\n\nAgain, the two short sides share two corner posts, so total for both short sides: 4*2 - 2 = 6 posts.\n\nNow, if I add the posts from the long sides and the short sides: 10 + 6 = 16 posts.\n\nWait, that's the same number I got earlier by dividing the perimeter by the post spacing.\n\nBut maybe there's a different way to look at it. Perhaps using the formula for the number of points around a closed loop.\n\nIn a closed loop, the number of points (or posts) is equal to the total length divided by the spacing between points.\n\nSo, in this case, 160 feet / 10 feet per post = 16 posts.\n\nBut let's verify this by considering the positions of the posts.\n\nStarting at one corner, place a post at 0 feet.\n\nThen, every 10 feet along the perimeter:\n\n0 ft, 10 ft, 20 ft, 30 ft, 40 ft, 50 ft (end of first long side), 60 ft (10 ft into the short side), 70 ft, 80 ft (end of first short side), 90 ft, 100 ft, 110 ft (end of second long side), 120 ft, 130 ft, 140 ft, 150 ft, 160 ft (back to the starting point).\n\nSo, counting these up: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160.\n\nWait, that's 17 positions, but 16 intervals of 10 feet each.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\nStart at 0 ft (post 1)\n\n10 ft (post 2)\n\n20 ft (post 3)\n\n30 ft (post 4)\n\n40 ft (post 5)\n\n50 ft (post 6)\n\nNow, moving to the short side: 50 ft + 10 ft = 60 ft (post 7)\n\n60 ft + 10 ft = 70 ft (post 8)\n\n70 ft + 10 ft = 80 ft (post 9)\n\n80 ft + 10 ft = 90 ft (post 10)\n\n90 ft + 10 ft = 100 ft (post 11)\n\n100 ft + 10 ft = 110 ft (post 12)\n\nNow, moving to the second long side: 110 ft + 10 ft = 120 ft (post 13)\n\n120 ft + 10 ft = 130 ft (post 14)\n\n130 ft + 10 ft = 140 ft (post 15)\n\n140 ft + 10 ft = 150 ft (post 16)\n\n150 ft + 10 ft = 160 ft, which brings us back to the starting point.\n\nBut that's 16 posts, not 17. I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nSo, starting from 0 ft up to 160 ft in 10 ft intervals gives us 17 positions, but since the starting point and the ending point coincide, we don't need an extra post; the first post serves as the last post.\n\nTherefore, the total number of posts needed is 16.\n\nAlternatively, in a closed loop, the number of posts is equal to the perimeter divided by the spacing between posts.\n\nSo, 160 ft / 10 ft = 16 posts.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
