Below is a simple Python script that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the maximum and minimum values in that list.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_min(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        print(\"The list is empty.\")\n        return\n    \n    maximum = numbers[0]\n    minimum = numbers[0]\n    \n    for num in numbers:\n        if num > maximum:\n            maximum = num\n        elif num < minimum:\n            minimum = num\n    \n    print(f\"The maximum value is: {maximum}\")\n    print(f\"The minimum value is: {minimum}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers_list = [3, 5, 1, 8, -2, 10]\nfind_max_min(numbers_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `find_max_min` that takes a list called `numbers` as its parameter.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: We check if the list is empty. If it is, we print a message and return early.\n3. **Initialization**: We initialize two variables, `maximum` and `minimum`, to the first element of the list.\n4. **Iteration and Comparison**: We loop through each number in the list:\n   - If the current number is greater than `maximum`, we update `maximum`.\n   - If the current number is less than `minimum`, we update `minimum`.\n5. **Output**: After the loop, we print the maximum and minimum values.\n6. **Example Usage**: We provide an example list and call the function with this list to demonstrate its usage.\n\nThis script is straightforward and efficient, ensuring that it correctly identifies the maximum and minimum values in any given list of numbers."
