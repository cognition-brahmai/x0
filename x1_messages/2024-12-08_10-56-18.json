        "content": "So there are 30 birds on a tree, and a hunter shoots and kills 10 of them. The question is, how many birds are left on the tree?\n\nAt first glance, it seems like a straightforward subtraction problem: 30 birds minus 10 killed birds equals 20 birds left. But let's think about it more carefully.\n\nWhen a hunter shoots and kills some birds, it's likely that the sound of the gunshot would scare away the remaining birds. So, even if some birds are still alive, they might fly away out of fear.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that after the hunter shoots and kills 10 birds, the remaining 20 birds might fly away. Therefore, there might be no birds left on the tree.\n\nBut perhaps not all the birds fly away. Maybe some are too scared to move, or maybe they're injured. However, the question doesn't specify any of that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hunter only kills 10 birds and doesn't scare away the others. But again, that seems unlikely.\n\nWait a minute, the question says, \"a hunter shoots and kills 10 of them.\" It doesn't say anything about the noise or the reaction of the other birds.\n\nSo, if we strictly follow the information given, which is that there were 30 birds and 10 were killed, then there are 20 birds left on the tree.\n\nBut, considering the real-world scenario, it's more plausible that the sound of the gunshot would scare away the remaining birds, so there would be no birds left on the tree.\n\nHowever, since this is a riddle-like question, it might be tricky, and the answer could be zero, assuming that the remaining birds flew away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the birds that weren't killed remain on the tree, despite the noise.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's consider another angle.\n\nIf the hunter shoots and kills 10 birds, those 10 are dead and presumably still on the tree or on the ground. The remaining 20 birds might or might not fly away.\n\nBut the question is about how many birds are left on the tree, not how many are alive.\n\nSo, if the 10 killed birds are still on the tree, and the other 20 fly away, then there would be 10 birds left on the tree, all of which are dead.\n\nBut that seems a bit macabre, and maybe not what the question is getting at.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the killed birds fall off the tree, depending on how they were shot and where they were perched.\n\nIf that's the case, then after shooting and killing 10 birds, those 10 fall off the tree, and the remaining 20 are scared away. Therefore, there would be no birds left on the tree.\n\nAlternatively, if some of the killed birds stay on the tree, and some of the alive birds stay too, but that seems unlikely.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer, without making additional assumptions, is that there are 20 birds left on the tree, assuming that only the 10 killed birds are removed and the others stay.\n\nBut, considering the noise from the gunshot would likely scare away the remaining birds, the more realistic answer is zero birds left on the tree.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is zero, as a play on words, suggesting that the noise caused all remaining birds to fly away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all 30 birds were killed, but only 10 were hit directly by the shots, and the others died from heart attacks or something, which seems far-fetched.\n\nWait, no, the question says \"shoots and kills 10 of them,\" implying that only 10 were killed.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Starting with 30 birds.\n\n- Hunter kills 10 birds.\n\n- The remaining 20 birds might fly away due to the noise.\n\nTherefore, there are zero birds left on the tree.\n\nBut, if we consider that only the killed birds fall off or are removed, and the living birds stay, then there would be 20 birds left on the tree.\n\nHowever, given the likely reaction of birds to a gunshot, the zero answer seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hunter is skilled enough to shoot in a way that doesn't scare away the other birds, but that seems unlikely.\n\nI think the answer is zero birds left on the tree.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
