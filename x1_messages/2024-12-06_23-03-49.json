        "content": "So I have this problem: I have 10 apples and I eat 2 every day. I need to figure out how many days it will take until I run out of apples. And I have to show my work.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I start with 10 apples. Every day, I eat 2 of them. I need to find out how many days it will take for all the apples to be eaten.\n\nFirst, I think I can approach this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples I eat each day. So, that would be 10 divided by 2. Let me do that calculation:\n\n10 \u00f7 2 = 5\n\nSo, according to this, it would take 5 days to eat all 10 apples.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I should think about it step by step, day by day, to make sure.\n\nDay 1: Start with 10 apples, eat 2, so 10 - 2 = 8 apples left.\n\nDay 2: Now have 8 apples, eat 2, so 8 - 2 = 6 apples left.\n\nDay 3: Have 6 apples, eat 2, so 6 - 2 = 4 apples left.\n\nDay 4: Have 4 apples, eat 2, so 4 - 2 = 2 apples left.\n\nDay 5: Have 2 apples, eat 2, so 2 - 2 = 0 apples left.\n\nOkay, so after 5 days, I have no apples left. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of multiplication. If I eat 2 apples per day, then after d days, I would have eaten 2 * d apples. I start with 10 apples, so I set up the equation:\n\n2 * d = 10\n\nThen, solve for d:\n\nd = 10 \u00f7 2\n\nd = 5\n\nAgain, that gives me 5 days.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using subtraction repeatedly.\n\nStart with 10 apples.\n\nSubtract 2 apples per day until you reach 0.\n\n10 - 2 = 8 (day 1)\n\n8 - 2 = 6 (day 2)\n\n6 - 2 = 4 (day 3)\n\n4 - 2 = 2 (day 4)\n\n2 - 2 = 0 (day 5)\n\nAgain, 5 days.\n\nWhat if I think about the rate of consumption? I'm eating 2 apples per day, so the rate is 2 apples/day.\n\nTotal apples divided by rate of consumption gives time.\n\nSo, time = total apples / rate\n\ntime = 10 apples / 2 apples/day = 5 days.\n\nEverything points to 5 days.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like, do the apples spoil over time? Is there any scenario where I might not eat 2 apples every day? But according to the problem, I eat 2 every day, so no need to consider variations.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not interpreting the problem differently. For example, sometimes problems might involve sharing apples or other variables, but in this case, it's straightforward: I have 10 apples, eat 2 daily, how many days until I run out.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 5 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
