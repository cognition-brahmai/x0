But let's dive into this a bit.\n\nIn biology, classification is key. Birds are a class of animals in the phylum Chordata, characterized by feathers, beaks, laying hard-shelled eggs, and being warm-blooded. So, by definition, if something doesn't meet these criteria, it's not a bird.\n\nBut perhaps you're thinking of cases where animals are called \"birds\" but don't fit the typical definition. For example, there are flightless birds like ostriches and penguins. While they can't fly, they still have the other characteristics of birds, so they're still classified as birds.\n\nAnother example might be baby birds, like chicks. They're birds, but they look very different from adult birds. Yet, they still possess the essential bird characteristics.\n\nThen there are birds that have evolved to look or behave differently. For instance, some birds have lost their ability to fly but still retain other bird features. So, in these cases, they're still birds, just with some adaptations.\n\nPerhaps you're thinking of animals that are called \"birds\" in common language but aren't actually birds scientifically. For example, bats are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"birds,\" but they're mammals, not birds. Similarly, insects like butterflies or moths might be called \"flying insects,\" but they're not birds at all.\n\nSo, in summary, if we're talking about scientific classification, something can't be a bird and not a bird simultaneously. It's either a bird or it isn't, based on its characteristics. However, in colloquial language, people might refer to various flying creatures as \"birds,\" even if they're not technically birds.\n\nIs there a specific example or context you had in mind when you asked this question?"
