        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem about a train traveling between two stations, A and B. It goes from A to B at 60 km/h and comes back at 90 km/h. I need to find the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, right? So, if I can find the total distance and the total time, I can calculate the average speed.\n\nLet me assume the distance between station A and station B is \\( d \\) kilometers. That means the total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\) kilometers.\n\nNow, I need to find the time taken for each leg of the trip.\n\nGoing from A to B at 60 km/h, the time taken is \\( \\frac{d}{60} \\) hours.\n\nReturning from B to A at 90 km/h, the time taken is \\( \\frac{d}{90} \\) hours.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is \\( \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{90} \\) hours.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{3d}{180} \\) and \\( \\frac{d}{90} = \\frac{2d}{180} \\).\n\nTherefore, the total time is \\( \\frac{3d}{180} + \\frac{2d}{180} = \\frac{5d}{180} = \\frac{d}{36} \\) hours.\n\nNow, the total distance is \\( 2d \\) kilometers, and the total time is \\( \\frac{d}{36} \\) hours.\n\nSo, the average speed is \\( \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{36}} = 2d \\times \\frac{36}{d} = 72 \\) km/h.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to look at this?\n\nI recall that for round trips where the speeds are different in each direction, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.\n\nThe formula for the harmonic mean of two speeds, \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\), is \\( \\frac{2 v_1 v_2}{v_1 + v_2} \\).\n\nLet me try that with \\( v_1 = 60 \\) km/h and \\( v_2 = 90 \\) km/h.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{2 \\times 60 \\times 90}{60 + 90} = \\frac{2 \\times 5400}{150} = \\frac{10800}{150} = 72 \\) km/h.\n\nThat matches my previous calculation. So, the average speed is 72 km/h.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the distance matters. I assumed it was \\( d \\) kilometers, but maybe I should pick a specific distance to verify.\n\nLet\u2019s say the distance between A and B is 180 kilometers.\n\nGoing from A to B at 60 km/h: time = \\( \\frac{180}{60} = 3 \\) hours.\n\nReturning from B to A at 90 km/h: time = \\( \\frac{180}{90} = 2 \\) hours.\n\nTotal distance = 180 + 180 = 360 kilometers.\n\nTotal time = 3 + 2 = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed = \\( \\frac{360}{5} = 72 \\) km/h.\n\nAgain, 72 km/h.\n\nLet me try with a different distance, say 90 kilometers.\n\nGoing from A to B at 60 km/h: time = \\( \\frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \\) hours.\n\nReturning from B to A at 90 km/h: time = \\( \\frac{90}{90} = 1 \\) hour.\n\nTotal distance = 90 + 90 = 180 kilometers.\n\nTotal time = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 hours.\n\nAverage speed = \\( \\frac{180}{2.5} = 72 \\) km/h.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter what the distance is, as long as the speeds are 60 km/h and 90 km/h respectively, the average speed for the round trip is 72 km/h.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, so I'm confident with the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
