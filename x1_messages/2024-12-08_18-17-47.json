        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a road trip and splitting the cost of gas evenly among some friends. Let's see what we've got. There are 5 people going on this trip, and they're planning to travel 600 miles round-trip. The car they're using gets 25 miles per gallon, and gas is currently $3.00 per gallon. I need to figure out how much each person should contribute to cover the gas cost.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much gas they'll need for the entire trip. Since the car gets 25 miles per gallon, and they're traveling 600 miles, I can calculate the total gallons of gas required by dividing the total miles by the miles per gallon. So, that's 600 miles divided by 25 miles per gallon, which is 24 gallons.\n\nNext, I need to find out how much that gas will cost in total. Since gas is $3.00 per gallon, and they need 24 gallons, the total cost is 24 gallons times $3.00 per gallon, which equals $72.00.\n\nNow, this total cost needs to be split evenly among the 5 people. So, to find out how much each person should contribute, I'll divide the total cost by the number of people. That's $72.00 divided by 5, which is $14.40 per person.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I'll do the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the total miles: 600 miles. Miles per gallon: 25 mpg. So, 600 divided by 25 is indeed 24 gallons. Then, 24 gallons times $3.00 per gallon is $72.00. And $72.00 divided by 5 people is $14.40 per person. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other costs involved. For example, is there a possibility that the gas price might change, or that the car's mileage might not be exact? But based on the information given, I think $14.40 per person is the accurate amount they should contribute to cover the gas cost for the trip.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem. Let's see. Perhaps I can calculate the cost per mile first, then multiply by the total miles and divide by the number of people.\n\nSo, cost per mile would be the price per gallon divided by miles per gallon. That's $3.00 per gallon divided by 25 miles per gallon, which is $0.12 per mile. Then, for 600 miles, the total cost would be 600 miles times $0.12 per mile, which is $72.00. Again, dividing by 5 people gives $14.40 per person. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way could be to find out how many gallons each person is responsible for. Since there are 5 people, each person's share of the gallons would be the total gallons divided by 5. That's 24 gallons divided by 5, which is 4.8 gallons per person. Then, 4.8 gallons times $3.00 per gallon is again $14.40 per person.\n\nHmm, all these methods lead me to the same answer. I think $14.40 is indeed the amount each person should contribute.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the cost. For instance, is there a possibility of stopping for gas multiple times, and does that affect the total cost? Probably not, since the total gas needed is based on the miles traveled and the car's mileage, regardless of how many times they fill up.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the car's tank size isn't a limiting factor. If the car has a 12-gallon tank, for example, and they need 24 gallons, they'll have to fill up twice. But again, the total cost remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, if the price of gas changes between fill-ups, that could affect the total cost. But since the problem states the current price of gas is $3.00 per gallon, I think we're supposed to assume that's the price they'll pay.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if the gas is bought in different places with potentially different prices. But the problem specifies the current price is $3.00 per gallon, so I think it's safe to use that figure.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the car is already filled with gas before the trip, and if the gas used for the trip is only the additional gas needed beyond what's already in the tank. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's reasonable to assume that the total gas needed is 24 gallons, regardless of the starting fuel level.\n\nAlternatively, if the car starts with a full tank and ends with a full tank, then the gas used for the trip is exactly the amount consumed during travel. But again, that should still be 24 gallons for 600 miles at 25 mpg.\n\nI think I've considered most of the angles here, and all of them point to $14.40 per person.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's try plugging in different numbers to see if the method holds. Suppose the trip was 300 miles round-trip. Then, gallons needed would be 300 miles divided by 25 mpg, which is 12 gallons. Total cost would be 12 gallons times $3.00, which is $36.00. Divided by 5 people, that's $7.20 per person.\n\nOr, if there were 4 people instead of 5, with the original 600 miles, gallons needed are still 24 gallons, total cost $72.00, divided by 4 people is $18.00 per person.\n\nSo, the method scales correctly with different miles and different numbers of people.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that $14.40 is the correct amount each person should contribute for the gas when there are 5 people going on a 600-mile round-trip in a car that gets 25 mpg with gas at $3.00 per gallon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14.40} \\]"
