        "content": "Sure! Here's a simple Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef average(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return 0\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of numbers to it. For example:\n\n```python\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(average(nums))  # Output: 3.0\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty and returns 0 in that case to avoid division by zero. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the numbers and divides it by the count of numbers to get the average."
