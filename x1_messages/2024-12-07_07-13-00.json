        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a train traveling from Town A to Town B. The train goes at a speed of 60 miles per hour and it takes 5 hours to make the trip. But there's a twist: the train stops for 30 minutes at a station somewhere between Town A and Town B. The question is asking how far it is from Town A to Town B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the total time of 5 hours includes. Does it include the stopping time, or is that additional? The way the problem is worded, \"it takes 5 hours to travel from Town A to Town B,\" and then it mentions that the train stops for 30 minutes at a station. So, it seems like the 5 hours is the total time, which includes both the traveling time and the stopping time.\n\nSo, if the train is stopped for 30 minutes, that's half an hour. So, the actual time the train is moving is 5 hours minus 30 minutes, which is 4.5 hours.\n\nNow, the train is moving at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 4.5 hours = 270 miles\n\nSo, the distance from Town A to Town B is 270 miles.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Suppose the total time of 5 hours is the wall clock time, including the stoppage. So, the train is moving at 60 mph but was stopped for 30 minutes. Maybe I need to consider the average speed or something.\n\nLet me think differently. If the train was moving for 4.5 hours at 60 mph, covering 270 miles, and then stopped for 0.5 hours, the total time is indeed 5 hours. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the train's average speed is less than 60 mph because of the stoppage, but the problem states that the train travels at 60 mph, implying that's its moving speed, not accounting for stops.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct. The distance from Town A to Town B is 270 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]"
