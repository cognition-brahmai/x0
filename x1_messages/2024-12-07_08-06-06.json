So, if I try to arrange them in order of height, Alice is taller than Bob, and Bob is taller than Claire. Dan is taller than Claire but shorter than Alice, so he fits between Alice and Claire. So, the order from tallest to shortest would be Alice, Dan, Bob, Claire. Therefore, Alice is the tallest person."
