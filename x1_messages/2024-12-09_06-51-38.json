        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find out how many unique prime factors the number 1,050 has. First, I should understand what a prime factor is. A prime factor is a factor of a number that is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nSo, to find the unique prime factors of 1,050, I need to factorize 1,050 into its prime components and then count how many distinct primes are in that factorization.\n\nLet's start by dividing 1,050 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n1,050 \u00f7 2 = 525\n\nSo, 2 is a prime factor of 1,050.\n\nNow, take 525 and divide it by the next smallest prime number, which is 3.\n\n525 \u00f7 3 = 175\n\nSo, 3 is another prime factor.\n\nNext, take 175 and divide it by the next smallest prime number, which is 5.\n\n175 \u00f7 5 = 35\n\nSo, 5 is a prime factor.\n\nNow, take 35 and divide it by 5 again.\n\n35 \u00f7 5 = 7\n\nSo, 5 is a prime factor again, but since we're looking for unique prime factors, we only count it once.\n\nFinally, 7 is a prime number itself, so it's another unique prime factor.\n\nLet's list out all the unique prime factors we've found: 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nTo make sure I haven't missed any, let's verify the factorization:\n\n1,050 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7\n\nBut since we're only interested in unique prime factors, we disregard the duplicate 5.\n\nSo, the unique prime factors are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nCounting them up, there are four unique prime factors.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that sometimes numbers can have higher powers of primes, but in this case, it's just asking for the number of unique primes, not their powers.\n\nSo, my final answer should be 4.\n\nBut let me double-check to be sure.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1,050 \u00f7 2 = 525 (2 is a prime factor)\n\n525 \u00f7 3 = 175 (3 is a prime factor)\n\n175 \u00f7 5 = 35 (5 is a prime factor)\n\n35 \u00f7 5 = 7 (5 is a prime factor again, but we only count it once)\n\n7 is a prime number (7 is a prime factor)\n\nSo, the unique prime factors are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a factor tree to verify.\n\nStarting with 1,050:\n\n1,050 can be factored into 105 \u00d7 10.\n\n105 can be factored into 21 \u00d7 5.\n\n21 can be factored into 7 \u00d7 3.\n\nSo, one branch is 1050 \u2192 105 \u00d7 10 \u2192 (21 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 5) \u2192 (7 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5.\n\nAgain, the unique prime factors are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I end up with the same set of unique prime factors.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique prime factors of 1,050 is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
