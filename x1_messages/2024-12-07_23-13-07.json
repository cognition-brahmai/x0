        "content": "So I have this problem here about students playing sports. There are 25 students in total, and among them, 15 play basketball, 17 play soccer, and 10 play both sports. I need to find out how many students don't play either sport. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many students play at least one of the sports, and then subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many don't play any sport.\n\nSo, there are 15 students who play basketball and 17 who play soccer. If I add those two numbers together, I get 15 + 17 = 32. But wait, that's more than the total number of students, which is 25. That must mean that some students are counted in both groups because they play both sports.\n\nAh, yes! The problem says that 10 students play both sports. So, those 10 students are included in both the basketball and soccer counts. That means if I just added 15 and 17, I'd be double-counting those 10 students. To correct for that, I need to subtract the number of students who play both sports from the total.\n\nSo, the number of students who play at least one sport is:\n\n15 (basketball) + 17 (soccer) - 10 (both) = 22 students.\n\nNow, since there are 25 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport would be:\n\n25 - 22 = 3 students.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nI can think about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That's the method I just used, where I add the sizes of the individual sets and subtract the intersection to avoid double-counting.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nLet me draw that out.\n\n[Imagining a Venn diagram with two circles overlapping. One circle for basketball, one for soccer.]\n\nThe overlapping part represents students who play both sports, which is 10 students.\n\nThe part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap would be students who only play basketball, and similarly for soccer.\n\nSo, students who only play basketball: 15 (total basketball) - 10 (both) = 5 students.\n\nStudents who only play soccer: 17 (total soccer) - 10 (both) = 7 students.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nOnly basketball: 5\n\nOnly soccer: 7\n\nBoth sports: 10\n\nTotal playing at least one sport: 5 + 7 + 10 = 22 students.\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total number of students: 25 - 22 = 3 students who don't play either sport.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the union of two sets:\n\nNumber of students playing at least one sport = Number playing basketball + Number playing soccer - Number playing both sports.\n\nWhich is again: 15 + 17 - 10 = 22.\n\nThen, total students minus students playing at least one sport: 25 - 22 = 3.\n\nI think this makes sense. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any students who are counted in a way that's not accounted for here.\n\nFor example, are there students who play only one sport? According to the calculations, there are 5 who only play basketball and 7 who only play soccer, plus 10 who play both, totaling 22.\n\nAnd then, 25 - 22 = 3 students who don't play any sport.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. It seems consistent across different methods: both the inclusion-exclusion principle and the Venn diagram approach lead to the same conclusion.\n\nSo, the answer should be 3 students don't play either sport.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
