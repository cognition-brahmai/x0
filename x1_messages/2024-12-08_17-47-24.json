Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, the formula is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. But, I need to make sure that the units match. Since the speed is in miles per hour, I should convert the time into hours.\n\nSo, 2 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 2.5 hours because 30 minutes is half an hour.\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 2.5 hours\n\nNow, multiplying 60 by 2.5:\n\n60 \u00d7 2.5 = 150\n\nSo, the car will travel 150 miles in 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to think about it in parts. First, calculate the distance traveled in 2 hours, and then the distance traveled in 30 minutes, and then add them together.\n\nSo, in 2 hours at 60 miles per hour:\n\nDistance = 60 \u00d7 2 = 120 miles\n\nAnd in 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours:\n\nDistance = 60 \u00d7 0.5 = 30 miles\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n120 + 30 = 150 miles\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours and 30 minutes is 150 minutes.\n\nBut, since the speed is in miles per hour, it's easier to keep it in hours. But just for fun, let's see.\n\nIf the car travels 60 miles in 60 minutes, then in one minute, it travels 1 mile.\n\nSo, in 150 minutes, it would travel 150 miles.\n\nAgain, that's the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which way I look at it, the car will travel 150 miles in 2 hours and 30 minutes at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\nI think that makes sense. Is there anything else I need to consider here? Like, is the car accelerating or decelerating? But the problem says it's traveling at 60 miles per hour, which I assume is a constant speed.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
