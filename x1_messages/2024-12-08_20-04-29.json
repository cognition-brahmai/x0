        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, John reads 30 pages every day. He has two books to read: the first one has 450 pages, and the second one has 550 pages. We need to find out how many days it will take him to read both books altogether.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days it takes him to read the first book. Since he reads 30 pages daily and the book has 450 pages, I can calculate the number of days by dividing the total pages by the daily reading rate. So, days for the first book = 450 pages \u00f7 30 pages/day.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 450 \u00f7 30. 30 times 15 is 450, so it takes him 15 days to read the first book.\n\nNext, he starts the second book, which has 550 pages. Again, reading 30 pages per day, the number of days for the second book would be 550 pages \u00f7 30 pages/day.\n\nCalculating 550 \u00f7 30. 30 times 18 is 540, and there's a remainder of 10 pages. So, 18 days for 540 pages, and he'll need one more day for the remaining 10 pages. Therefore, total days for the second book are 18 + 1 = 19 days.\n\nNow, to find the total days to read both books, I just need to add the days for the first book and the days for the second book together. So, total days = days for first book + days for second book = 15 days + 19 days.\n\nAdding those up, 15 + 19 equals 34 days.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. For the second book, 550 \u00f7 30 is 18.333..., which means 18 full days and a fraction of a day for the remaining pages. Since he can't read a fraction of a day, I rounded it up to 19 days. But maybe there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total pages of both books combined and then divide by the daily reading rate.\n\nTotal pages = 450 + 550 = 1000 pages.\n\nDaily reading = 30 pages/day.\n\nTotal days = 1000 \u00f7 30.\n\n1000 \u00f7 30 is approximately 33.333... days.\n\nSince he can't read a fraction of a day, I'll need to round up to the next whole number, which is 34 days.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me verify the rounding. 30 pages/day for 33 days would be 30 * 33 = 990 pages.\n\nHe has 1000 pages in total, so after 33 days, he would have 1000 - 990 = 10 pages left.\n\nSince he reads 30 pages per day, he would need an additional day to read those remaining 10 pages.\n\nTherefore, total days are indeed 33 + 1 = 34 days.\n\nAlternatively, using the ceiling function for the division since you can't have a fraction of a day.\n\nIn mathematical terms, days = ceil(total pages / daily reading rate).\n\nSo, days = ceil(1000 / 30) = ceil(33.333...) = 34 days.\n\nThis confirms my previous conclusion.\n\nTherefore, it will take John 34 days to read both books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{34} \\]"
