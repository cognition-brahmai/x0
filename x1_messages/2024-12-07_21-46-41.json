        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if a person reads 30 pages in 15 minutes, how long will it take them to read a 450-page book? And I need to explain my thought process. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how fast the person reads. Reading speed is usually measured in pages per minute or pages per hour, but since the time given is in minutes, I'll stick with pages per minute for now.\n\nSo, the person reads 30 pages in 15 minutes. To find the reading speed, I can divide the number of pages by the time it takes to read them. That is:\n\nReading speed = pages / time\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nReading speed = 30 pages / 15 minutes = 2 pages per minute\n\nOkay, so the person reads at a speed of 2 pages per minute.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it will take to read a 450-page book at this speed. Since I know the reading speed, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = pages / reading speed\n\nSo, time = 450 pages / 2 pages per minute\n\nThat gives:\n\nTime = 225 minutes\n\nBut wait, 225 minutes seems like a long time. Maybe I should convert that into hours to make more sense. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\nHours = 225 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3.75 hours\n\nWhich is 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo, it will take the person 225 minutes or 3 hours and 45 minutes to read a 450-page book.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, reading speed is 30 pages in 15 minutes, which is indeed 2 pages per minute.\n\nThen, for 450 pages at 2 pages per minute, it should be 450 / 2 = 225 minutes.\n\nConverting 225 minutes to hours: 225 / 60 = 3.75 hours, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. If 30 pages take 15 minutes, then 450 pages would take x minutes.\n\nSo, 30 pages : 15 minutes = 450 pages : x minutes\n\nThis is a proportion, so I can set it up as:\n\n30/15 = 450/x\n\nSolving for x:\n\n30x = 15 * 450\n\n30x = 6750\n\nx = 6750 / 30\n\nx = 225 minutes\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of units. If 30 pages take 15 minutes, then 1 page takes 15/30 = 0.5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, 450 pages would take 450 * 0.5 = 225 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it, I end up with 225 minutes.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any breaks or rest periods that might be needed for longer reading sessions, but the problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I'll assume the reading is continuous without breaks.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the reading speed remains constant throughout the entire book. Again, the problem doesn't suggest any change in reading speed, so I'll assume it remains constant.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is that it will take the person 225 minutes, or 3 hours and 45 minutes, to read a 450-page book.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{225 \\text{ minutes} \\text{ or } 3 \\text{ hours and } 45 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
