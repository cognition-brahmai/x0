        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 8 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 4 green balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at random without replacement, both of them will be red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of balls in the box. There are 8 red, 6 blue, and 4 green, so total balls are 8 + 6 + 4, which equals 18 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of picking two red balls without replacement. Without replacement means that once I pick the first ball, it stays out, and the total number of balls decreases by one for the second pick.\n\nSo, the probability of the first ball being red is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 8/18.\n\nAfter picking the first red ball, there are now 7 red balls left and the total number of balls is now 17, since we didn't replace the first ball.\n\nSo, the probability of the second ball being red, given that the first one was red, is 7/17.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the overall probability is (8/18) * (7/17).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 8/18 can be simplified to 4/9.\n\nThen, 4/9 * 7/17 = (4*7) / (9*17) = 28 / 153.\n\nI can check if this fraction can be simplified. Let's see, 28 and 153.\n\n28 divided by 7 is 4, and 153 divided by 7 is approximately 21.857, which is not an integer, so no common factors here.\n\nSo, the probability is 28/153.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert this to a decimal to get a better sense.\n\n28 divided by 153 is approximately 0.183, or 18.3%.\n\nSo, there's about an 18.3% chance that both balls picked will be red.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal balls: 8 red + 6 blue + 4 green = 18 balls. That's correct.\n\nProbability first ball red: 8/18 = 4/9. Correct.\n\nAfter picking one red ball, red balls left: 7.\n\nTotal balls left: 17.\n\nProbability second ball red: 7/17. Correct.\n\nMultiply them: (4/9)*(7/17) = 28/153. No simplification possible. Correct.\n\nDecimal conversion: 28 \u00f7 153 \u2248 0.183, or 18.3%. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 28/153, or approximately 18.3%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{28}{153}} \\]"
