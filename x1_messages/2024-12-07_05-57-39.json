        "content": "So the factory makes 1000 widgets every day, but 3% of them are faulty and can't be sold. I need to find out how many non-faulty widgets are made in one week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many faulty widgets are made each day. If 3% are faulty, then the number of faulty widgets per day is 3% of 1000. Let me calculate that:\n\n3% of 1000 is (3/100) * 1000 = 30 widgets.\n\nSo, each day, 30 widgets are faulty.\n\nSince the factory makes 1000 widgets per day, the number of non-faulty widgets per day is:\n\n1000 - 30 = 970 widgets.\n\nNow, to find out how many non-faulty widgets are made in one week, I need to multiply the daily non-faulty production by the number of days in a week. Assuming a week has 7 days:\n\n970 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 6790 widgets/week.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total weekly production first and then subtract the total faulty widgets for the week.\n\nTotal weekly production: 1000 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 7000 widgets/week.\n\nTotal faulty widgets per week: 30 widgets/day * 7 days/week = 210 widgets/week.\n\nThen, non-faulty widgets per week: 7000 - 210 = 6790 widgets.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the percentage of non-faulty widgets.\n\nIf 3% are faulty, then 97% are non-faulty.\n\nSo, 97% of 1000 is (97/100) * 1000 = 970 widgets per day, which again leads to 970 * 7 = 6790 widgets per week.\n\nAll these methods give me the same answer, so I'm confident that 6790 is the correct number of non-faulty widgets produced in one week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6790} \\]"
