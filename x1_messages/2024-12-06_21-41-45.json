        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly. There's a class of 30 students, out of which 12 are girls and 18 are boys. We need to find the probability that exactly 3 out of 5 randomly selected students are girls. Okay, sounds straightforward. I think I should use combinations for this since the order in which we select the students doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of ways to select 5 students out of 30. That would be the combination of 30 things taken 5 at a time, right? The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 5 students out of 30 is C(30, 5). Let me calculate that.\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5! * 25!) = (30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 26) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = ?\n\nLet's compute the numerator: 30 \u00d7 29 = 870, 870 \u00d7 28 = 24,360, 24,360 \u00d7 27 = 657,720, and 657,720 \u00d7 26 = 17,100,720.\n\nNow, the denominator: 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nSo, C(30, 5) = 17,100,720 / 120 = 142,506.\n\nAlright, that's the total number of possible ways to choose 5 students.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to choose exactly 3 girls out of 12 and 2 boys out of 18.\n\nFirst, the number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 12 is C(12, 3).\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * 9!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1,320 / 6 = 220.\n\nThen, the number of ways to choose 2 boys out of 18 is C(18, 2).\n\nC(18, 2) = 18! / (2! * 16!) = (18 \u00d7 17) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 306 / 2 = 153.\n\nNow, since these are independent events, the number of ways to choose 3 girls and 2 boys is the product of the two combinations: 220 \u00d7 153.\n\nLet me calculate that: 220 \u00d7 153.\n\nFirst, 200 \u00d7 153 = 30,600.\n\nThen, 20 \u00d7 153 = 3,060.\n\nSo, total is 30,600 + 3,060 = 33,660.\n\nTherefore, there are 33,660 favorable ways to choose exactly 3 girls and 2 boys.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, probability P = 33,660 / 142,506.\n\nLet's simplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 6.\n\n33,660 \u00f7 6 = 5,610.\n\n142,506 \u00f7 6 = 23,751.\n\nSo, P = 5,610 / 23,751.\n\nHmm, can this be simplified further? Let's check if 5,610 and 23,751 have any common divisors.\n\nLet's see, 5,610 is divisible by 3 (since 5 + 6 + 1 + 0 = 12, which is divisible by 3). Let's check 23,751: 2 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 1 = 18, which is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo, divide numerator and denominator by 3.\n\n5,610 \u00f7 3 = 1,870.\n\n23,751 \u00f7 3 = 7,917.\n\nNow, P = 1,870 / 7,917.\n\nLet's see if these numbers have any common divisors. 1,870 is even, but 7,917 is odd, so not divisible by 2. Let's check for 5: 1,870 ends with 0, so divisible by 5, but 7,917 ends with 7, so not divisible by 5.\n\nNext, check for 11: For 1,870: 1 - 8 + 7 - 0 = 0, which is divisible by 11. For 7,917: 7 - 9 + 1 - 7 = -8, not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, no common divisor there.\n\nLet's check for 17: 1,870 \u00f7 17 = 110, since 17 \u00d7 110 = 1,870. Now, 7,917 \u00f7 17 = 465.647..., not a whole number.\n\nSo, no common divisor there.\n\nPerhaps it's simplified enough, but maybe I can leave it as a decimal for better understanding.\n\nSo, P = 1,870 / 7,917 \u2248 0.2362.\n\nTo express it as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.2362 \u00d7 100 \u2248 23.62%.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting exactly 3 girls out of 5 students is approximately 23.62%.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the combination calculations.\n\nFirst, C(30, 5) = 142,506 seems correct.\n\nThen, C(12, 3) = 220 also seems correct.\n\nC(18, 2) = 153 seems right as well.\n\nThen, 220 \u00d7 153 = 33,660.\n\nTotal probability P = 33,660 / 142,506.\n\nSimplifying: divide numerator and denominator by 6 to get 5,610 / 23,751.\n\nThen divide by 3: 1,870 / 7,917.\n\nNo common divisors here.\n\nSo, P \u2248 0.2362 or 23.62%.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for hypergeometric distribution, which is what this problem follows since it's sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (30 students)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (12 girls)\n\n- n is the number of draws (5 students)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (3 girls)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 3) = [C(12, 3) * C(30 - 12, 5 - 3)] / C(30, 5) = [C(12, 3) * C(18, 2)] / C(30, 5) = (220 * 153) / 142,506 = 33,660 / 142,506 \u2248 0.2362\n\nSo, same result.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2362} \\]"
