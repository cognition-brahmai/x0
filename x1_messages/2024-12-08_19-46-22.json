        "content": "Sure! To create a Java program that interacts with a Memcached server, you'll need to use a Memcached client library for Java. One of the most popular libraries is `spymemcached`. Below, I'll guide you through the process of setting up your environment and writing the code to connect to a Memcached server, store a key-value pair, retrieve the value, and delete the key-value pair.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK installed on your machine.\n2. **Memcached Server**: Make sure Memcached is installed and running on your machine or a server you can access.\n3. **Spymemcached Library**: You'll need to include this library in your project. If you're using Maven, you can add it via dependencies in your `pom.xml`.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Project\n\nIf you're using Maven, create a new Maven project and add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>net.spy</groupId>\n    <artifactId>spymemcached</artifactId>\n    <version>2.12.3</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Write the Java Code\n\nCreate a new Java class, for example, `MemcachedExample.java`, and write the following code:\n\n```java\nimport net.spy.memcached.MemcachedClient;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.net.InetSocketAddress;\n\npublic class MemcachedExample {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Connect to the Memcached server\n            MemcachedClient memcachedClient = new MemcachedClient(new InetSocketAddress(\"localhost\", 11211));\n            System.out.println(\"Connected to Memcached server successfully.\");\n\n            // Store a key-value pair\n            String key = \"exampleKey\";\n            String value = \"exampleValue\";\n            memcachedClient.set(key, 3600, value).get(); // Expiry time in seconds\n            System.out.println(\"Stored key-value pair: \" + key + \" -> \" + value);\n\n            // Retrieve the value using the key\n            String retrievedValue = memcachedClient.get(key);\n            System.out.println(\"Retrieved value for key \" + key + \": \" + retrievedValue);\n\n            // Delete the key-value pair\n            memcachedClient.delete(key).get();\n            System.out.println(\"Deleted key: \" + key);\n\n            // Try to retrieve the deleted key to confirm deletion\n            String afterDelete = memcachedClient.get(key);\n            if (afterDelete == null) {\n                System.out.println(\"Key \" + key + \" has been successfully deleted.\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Key \" + key + \" was not deleted properly.\");\n            }\n\n            // Close the connection\n            memcachedClient.shutdown();\n            System.out.println(\"Connection to Memcached server closed.\");\n\n        } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Connecting to Memcached Server**:\n   - We use `MemcachedClient` to connect to the Memcached server running on `localhost` at port `11211`.\n\n2. **Storing a Key-Value Pair**:\n   - We use the `set` method to store a key-value pair with an expiry time of 3600 seconds (1 hour).\n\n3. **Retrieving the Value**:\n   - We use the `get` method to retrieve the value associated with the key.\n\n4. **Deleting the Key-Value Pair**:\n   - We use the `delete` method to remove the key-value pair from the cache.\n\n5. **Closing the Connection**:\n   - Finally, we shut down the `MemcachedClient` to close the connection.\n\n### Running the Program\n\n1. Ensure Memcached is running on your machine or update the connection details to point to your Memcached server.\n2. Compile and run the Java program.\n\nThis should connect to the Memcached server, perform the operations as specified, and then close the connection."
