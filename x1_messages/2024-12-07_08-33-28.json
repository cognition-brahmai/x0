        "content": "So there are 7 chairs in a row, and Alice and Bob want to sit next to each other. There are also five other people sitting with them. I need to figure out how many different ways they can all be seated under these conditions.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to treat Alice and Bob since they want to sit next to each other. Maybe I can consider them as a single unit or something like that.\n\nIf I treat Alice and Bob as a single unit, then together with the five other people, it's like seating 6 units in a row. But wait, Alice and Bob can switch places within their unit, right? So I need to account for that.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. If Alice and Bob are treated as a single unit, then the number of ways to arrange these 6 units is 6!. But within their unit, Alice and Bob can switch places, so I need to multiply by 2 for that.\n\nSo, total arrangements would be 6! \u00d7 2.\n\nBut let me double-check this approach. Is there any other way to think about it?\n\nAnother way is to think about the total number of ways to arrange all 7 people without any restrictions, which would be 7!. But that includes arrangements where Alice and Bob are not sitting next to each other. So, to find the number of arrangements where they are sitting next to each other, I can subtract the number of arrangements where they are not sitting next to each other from the total arrangements.\n\nWait, but that seems more complicated. Maybe my first approach is better.\n\nLet me calculate 6! \u00d7 2. 6! is 720, multiplied by 2 is 1440. So, there are 1440 ways.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider a smaller example. Suppose there are 3 chairs and two people who want to sit next to each other, along with one other person.\n\nIf I treat the two people as a single unit, then I have 2 units: the pair and the single person. The number of ways to arrange these units is 2!, and within the pair, they can switch places, so 2! \u00d7 2 = 4.\n\nBut let's list them out. Let\u2019s call the people A, B, and C, with A and B wanting to sit together.\n\nPossible arrangements:\n\n1. A B C\n\n2. B A C\n\n3. C A B\n\n4. C B A\n\nIndeed, 4 arrangements, which matches my calculation.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, 6! \u00d7 2 = 1440 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the positions where Alice and Bob can sit next to each other.\n\nIn a row of 7 chairs, the possible pairs of adjacent chairs are:\n\nChair 1 and 2\n\nChair 2 and 3\n\nChair 3 and 4\n\nChair 4 and 5\n\nChair 5 and 6\n\nChair 6 and 7\n\nSo, there are 6 possible pairs of adjacent chairs.\n\nFor each pair, Alice and Bob can switch places, so 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 ways for Alice and Bob to sit next to each other.\n\nThen, the remaining 5 people can be arranged in the remaining 5 chairs in 5! ways.\n\nSo, total arrangements would be 12 \u00d7 5! = 12 \u00d7 120 = 1440.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1440.\n\nWait a minute, is there any overlap or something I'm missing?\n\nLet me think again. In the first approach, treating Alice and Bob as a single unit, we have 6 units, arranged in 6! ways, and multiplied by 2 for the internal arrangement of Alice and Bob.\n\nIn the second approach, I considered the number of adjacent pairs, which is 6, multiplied by 2 for Alice and Bob switching places, and then multiplied by 5! for the remaining people.\n\nBoth approaches give the same result, so I'm confident that 1440 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the probability approach. The total number of ways to arrange 7 people is 7!. The number of ways where Alice and Bob are sitting next to each other is what we're trying to find.\n\nFrom probability, the probability that Alice and Bob sit next to each other is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total arrangements.\n\nBut in this case, since we're asked for the number of arrangements, sticking to the combinatorial approach is better.\n\nSo, to summarize, using either the unit approach or the adjacent pairs approach, the number of ways Alice and Bob can be seated next to each other along with five other people is 1440.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1440} \\]"
