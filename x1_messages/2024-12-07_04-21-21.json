        "content": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the total cost of renting a car. The car rental company charges $20 per day plus $0.15 per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for three days and driving 150 miles. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the cost of renting the car for three days. Since the daily rental cost is $20, I can multiply that by the number of days:\n\nDaily rental cost: $20 per day\n\nNumber of days: 3\n\nSo, 20 * 3 = $60\n\nThat's the cost for the three days.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for the miles driven. The company charges $0.15 per mile, and the user drove 150 miles. So, I'll multiply the per-mile charge by the number of miles:\n\nPer-mile charge: $0.15 per mile\n\nMiles driven: 150\n\nSo, 0.15 * 150 = $22.50\n\nThat's the cost for the miles driven.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the two amounts together:\n\nRental cost: $60\n\nMileage cost: $22.50\n\nTotal cost: 60 + 22.50 = $82.50\n\nSo, the total cost of renting the car for three days and driving 150 miles is $82.50.\n\nLet me just double-check that I didn't miss anything. The rental cost is straightforward: $20 per day for three days is $60. The mileage cost is $0.15 per mile for 150 miles, which is $22.50. Adding those together gives $82.50. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{82.50} \\]"
