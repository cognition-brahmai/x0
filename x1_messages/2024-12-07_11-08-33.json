So, the current monthly production is 250 units/day * 20 days/month = 5,000 units/month. Wait, but the monthly production target is also 5,000 units. So, does that mean they're already meeting the target?\n\nBut the question says, \"how many more units does the factory need to produce daily to meet the target?\" If they're already producing 5,000 units a month, and the target is 5,000 units, then they don't need to produce any more units. The answer would be zero.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A factory produces 250 units of a product per day. If the factory operates for 20 days each month and the monthly production target is 5,000 units, how many more units does the factory need to produce daily to meet the target?\"\n\nOkay, so calculating current production: 250 units/day * 20 days/month = 5,000 units/month. Target is 5,000 units/month. So, 5,000 - 5,000 = 0 units short.\n\nTherefore, the factory doesn't need to produce any more units; they are already meeting the target.\n\nWait, but maybe the factory wants to meet a different target or there's a miscalculation. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory operates 20 days a month, but the target is 5,000 units per month, and they are already producing 5,000 units per month (250 units/day * 20 days = 5,000 units). So, they don't need to produce any additional units.\n\nHence, the answer should be that the factory does not need to produce any more units daily to meet the target; they are already meeting it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
