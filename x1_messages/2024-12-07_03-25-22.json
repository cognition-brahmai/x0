        "content": "Galaxies can exist for billions of years. The exact lifespan of a galaxy depends on various factors such as its size, composition, and interactions with other galaxies. Some galaxies may continue to exist for tens of billions of years or more, while others may merge with neighboring galaxies or be consumed by supermassive black holes at their centers. However, it's worth noting that the universe itself is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old, so the maximum age of any galaxy cannot exceed this value."
