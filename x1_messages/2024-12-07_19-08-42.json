        "content": "Let's see. So, we have two trains leaving the same station but at different times, and they're traveling at different constant speeds. The first train leaves at 9 AM at 60 miles per hour, and the second train leaves at 10 AM at 90 miles per hour. We need to find out when the second train will catch up with the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how far ahead the first train is by the time the second train starts at 10 AM. Since the first train leaves at 9 AM and the second at 10 AM, there's a one-hour difference. In that one hour, the first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so it covers 60 miles in that hour. So, when the second train starts at 10 AM, the first train is already 60 miles ahead.\n\nNow, the second train is traveling faster than the first one; it's going at 90 miles per hour compared to the first train's 60 miles per hour. So, the second train is closing the gap at a rate of 90 - 60 = 30 miles per hour.\n\nSo, the second train is gaining on the first train at 30 miles per hour. The first train is 60 miles ahead when the second train starts. So, to catch up, the second train needs to cover that 60-mile gap at a rate of 30 miles per hour.\n\nTo find out how long it will take to catch up, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nHere, the distance is 60 miles, and the relative speed is 30 miles per hour.\n\nSo, Time = 60 miles / 30 miles per hour = 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, the second train will catch up with the first train 2 hours after it starts, which is at 10 AM + 2 hours = 12 PM.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to set up equations for the distance each train travels and find when those distances are equal.\n\nLet's let t be the time in hours after 10 AM.\n\nSo, for the first train, which left at 9 AM, the time it has been traveling when the second train has been traveling for t hours is t + 1 hours.\n\nDistance of first train = speed * time = 60 * (t + 1)\n\nDistance of second train = 90 * t\n\nWe set these equal to find when the second train catches up:\n\n60(t + 1) = 90t\n\nLet's solve for t:\n\n60t + 60 = 90t\n\n60 = 90t - 60t\n\n60 = 30t\n\nt = 60 / 30\n\nt = 2 hours\n\nSo, again, t = 2 hours after 10 AM, which is 12 PM.\n\nHmm, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it in terms of relative speed again.\n\nThe first train is 60 miles ahead at 10 AM.\n\nThe second train is catching up at 30 miles per hour.\n\nSo, in 2 hours, it would cover 60 miles, which is the head start of the first train.\n\nTherefore, they meet at 12 PM.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there's any other factor to consider, like the direction they're traveling or anything like that. The problem doesn't specify directions, so I'm assuming they're traveling in the same direction.\n\nAlso, both trains are traveling at constant speeds, which makes this a straightforward relative speed problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the speeds in terms of miles per minute to see if that gives me the same result.\n\n60 miles per hour is 1 mile per minute, and 90 miles per hour is 1.5 miles per minute.\n\nThe relative speed is 1.5 - 1 = 0.5 miles per minute.\n\nThe first train is 60 miles ahead, which is 60 miles.\n\nTime = distance / relative speed = 60 miles / 0.5 miles per minute = 120 minutes, which is 2 hours.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, it seems consistent across different methods.\n\nTherefore, the second train will catch up with the first train at 12 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
