        "content": "Alright, so I have this task here. The user wants me to analyze the sentiment of a review that says, \"I absolutely love this product!\" and they've given me a list of available functions to choose from. I need to pick the right one and specify the parameters in YAML format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each function does:\n\n1. **product_review**: This function is for collecting and organizing product reviews. It has parameters for product_id and review_text. But the user wants sentiment analysis, not just to collect the review.\n\n2. **text_analysis**: This one seems promising. It's described as a tool that analyzes text data for sentiment, key phrases, entities, etc. It has a parameter called \"action\" where I can specify what kind of analysis to perform, like \"sentiment\", \"key_phrases\", \"entities\", etc.\n\n3. **email_response**: This function helps draft email responses using templates and input data. That doesn't relate to sentiment analysis at all.\n\nSo, clearly, **text_analysis** is the function I should choose.\n\nNow, I need to specify the parameters for text_analysis. According to the description, it has a parameter called \"action\" where I can specify the type of analysis. Since the user wants to analyze the sentiment of the review, I should set \"action\" to \"sentiment\".\n\nAdditionally, I need to provide the text that needs to be analyzed. Looking back at the product_review function, it has a parameter called \"review_text\", but since I'm using text_analysis, I need to see if there's a similar parameter. The text_analysis function has a parameter called \"params\", which is a dictionary that includes \"action\" and possibly other things. Maybe I need to include the text inside the \"params\" as well.\n\nWait, the available functions list shows:\n\ntext_analysis:\n\ndescription: This tool analyzes text data for sentiment, key phrases, entities, etc.\n\nparams:\n\naction: The type of analysis we want to perform such as \"sentiment\", \"key_phrases\", \"entities\", etc.\n\nHmm, it only mentions \"action\" as a parameter. Maybe the text to be analyzed is passed differently. Perhaps it's expected to be included in the \"params\" as well, or maybe it's implied that the text is passed separately.\n\nWait, looking back at the other functions:\n\nproduct_review:\n\nparameters:\n\nproduct_id: Unique identifier of the product.\n\nreview_text: Text of the review.\n\nemail_response:\n\nparams:\n\ntemplate: Template to use for drafting the email.\n\ndata: Data to fill in the template.\n\nSo, in product_review, there's a clear \"review_text\" parameter, but in text_analysis, it's not specified. Maybe I need to include the text to be analyzed within the \"params\" dictionary.\n\nPerhaps \"params\" is a general term, and inside it, I can include both \"action\" and \"text\".\n\nLet me check the instructions again: \"Please choose the appropriate function and parameters from the given list of available functions according to the user's request. Present your answer in YAML format.\"\n\nThe user's request is to \"Analyze the sentiment of the following review - 'I absolutely love this product!'\" So, I need to choose the function that can perform sentiment analysis on that specific text.\n\nGiven that text_analysis can perform sentiment analysis, I should use that function and provide the text to be analyzed.\n\nMaybe the \"params\" for text_analysis should include both \"action\": \"sentiment\" and \"text\": \"I absolutely love this product!\"\n\nBut in the available functions list, it only shows \"params\" with \"action\" as an example.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"params\" is a dictionary that can hold multiple key-value pairs, including the action and the text.\n\nSo, I can structure it like this:\n\nfunction: text_analysis\n\nparams:\n\naction: sentiment\n\ntext: \"I absolutely love this product!\"\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct format because in the available functions list, only \"action\" is mentioned under \"params\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text to be analyzed is passed separately, not within \"params\".\n\nWait, looking back at the instructions, the user provided the review text separately: \"Analyze the sentiment of the following review - 'I absolutely love this product!'\" So, perhaps the text is already given and I just need to specify the action in params.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll include the text in the params as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text is passed as an input to the function separately.\n\nBut since I need to present the answer in YAML format, including the function and parameters, I should include all necessary information.\n\nLet me look up how to structure this in YAML.\n\nA typical YAML structure for this would be:\n\nfunction: text_analysis\n\nparams:\n\naction: sentiment\n\ntext: \"I absolutely love this product!\"\n\nBut again, the available functions list only shows \"action\" under \"params\". Maybe \"text\" is not required because the text is already provided in the user's request.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reference the text in the params.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text is implied and I just need to specify the action.\n\nBut to ensure clarity, I'll include the text explicitly.\n\nSo, my final answer in YAML format would be:\n\nfunction: text_analysis\n\nparams:\n\naction: sentiment\n\ntext: \"I absolutely love this product!\"\n\nThis way, it's clear what function to use and what parameters to pass, including the text to be analyzed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\text{function: text\\_analysis} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{params:} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{action: sentiment} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{text: \"I absolutely love this product!\"} \\]"
