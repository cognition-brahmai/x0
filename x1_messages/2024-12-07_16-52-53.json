I think I should divide the total number of pages by the number of pages I read each day. So, 450 divided by 30. Let me do that. 450 divided by 30 is 15. So, it should take 15 days to finish the book. But wait, let me double-check. If I read 30 pages a day for 15 days, that's 30 times 15, which is 450 pages. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the answer is 15 days.#\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
