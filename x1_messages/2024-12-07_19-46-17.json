        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 8 balls. You're going to pick one ball at random, look at its color, put it back in the bag, mix them up again, and then pick another ball. You want to know the probability of getting a red ball first and then a blue ball.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Since you're putting the ball back each time, each pick is independent of the other. That means the outcome of the first pick doesn't affect the second pick.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of picking a red ball on the first try. There are 5 red balls out of 8 total balls, so the probability is 5/8.\n\nNext, the probability of picking a blue ball on the second try. There are 3 blue balls out of 8 total balls, so that's 3/8.\n\nSince these are independent events, to find the probability of both happening in sequence\u2014first a red ball and then a blue ball\u2014we multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, the probability is (5/8) * (3/8) = 15/64.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting a red ball followed by a blue ball is 15/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{64}} \\]"
