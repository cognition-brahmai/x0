        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Alex and Bella playing a game, and Alex scores double the points that Bella does. Together, they score a total of 36 points. We need to find out how many points each of them scored.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's being said. Alex scores double what Bella scores. That means if Bella scores, say, 10 points, then Alex scores 20 points. Together, that would be 10 + 20 = 30 points. But in this case, they scored 36 points in total. So, Bella must have scored more than 10 points.\n\nWait, maybe we can approach this with some algebra. Let's assign variables to the points they scored. Let\u2019s say Bella scored B points. Since Alex scored double that, Alex scored 2B points.\n\nNow, together they scored 36 points, so Bella's points plus Alex's points equal 36. That gives us the equation:\n\nB + 2B = 36\n\nCombining like terms, that's 3B = 36\n\nTo find B, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\n3B / 3 = 36 / 3\n\nSo, B = 12\n\nTherefore, Bella scored 12 points. Since Alex scored double that, Alex scored 2 * 12 = 24 points.\n\nLet's check if that makes sense. 12 + 24 = 36, which matches the total points they scored together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Since Alex scored double what Bella did, that means for every point Bella scored, Alex scored two points. So together, for every point Bella scores, they score a total of 3 points (1 for Bella and 2 for Alex).\n\nSo, if their combined score is 36 points, we can divide that by 3 to find out how many \"sets\" of points they scored.\n\n36 / 3 = 12\n\nSo, Bella scored 12 points, and Alex scored 24 points. That matches what we found earlier.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the ratio of their scores. Alex scored double Bella, so the ratio of Alex's points to Bella's points is 2:1.\n\nIn terms of the total, for every 3 parts (2 parts Alex + 1 part Bella), they scored 36 points.\n\nSo, one part is 36 / 3 = 12 points.\n\nTherefore, Bella, who has one part, scored 12 points, and Alex, with two parts, scored 24 points.\n\nAll these methods lead us to the same conclusion. So, it seems consistent.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about it in a simpler way.\n\nIf Alex scored double what Bella did, that means Alex's score is twice Bella's score.\n\nLet\u2019s denote Bella's score as B. Then Alex's score is 2B.\n\nTogether, they scored 36 points, so B + 2B = 36.\n\nThat simplifies to 3B = 36.\n\nDividing both sides by 3, B = 12.\n\nSo, Bella scored 12 points, and Alex scored 24 points.\n\nYeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility that \"double the points\" means something else? For example, does it include Bella's points as well?\n\nWait, no. If Alex scores double what Bella does, it means Alex scores twice Bella's score, not twice the total or anything like that.\n\nSo, the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of proportions, Bella has one portion, Alex has two portions. Together, they have three portions, which equal 36 points.\n\nSo, one portion is 12 points, which is Bella's score, and two portions are 24 points, which is Alex's score.\n\nThis matches our previous calculation.\n\nI think it's clear now. Bella scored 12 points, and Alex scored 24 points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Bella: } 12 \\text{ points}, \\text{ Alex: } 24 \\text{ points}} \\]"
