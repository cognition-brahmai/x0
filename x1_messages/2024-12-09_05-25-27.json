        "content": "So I have this problem here about a square garden. The side length is 10 meters, and I need to find out how much distance I save by walking diagonally across the garden instead of walking along two sides. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since it's a square garden, all sides are equal, so each side is 10 meters. If I walk along two sides, that would be like going from one corner to another by turning the corner, right? So, that would be the sum of two sides: 10 meters plus 10 meters, which is 20 meters.\n\nNow, if I walk diagonally across the garden, I'm taking a straight path from one corner to the opposite corner. To find the length of that diagonal, I can use the Pythagorean theorem because in a square, the diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with the two sides.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, for this square, the diagonal \\( d \\) can be found using:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 100} = \\sqrt{200} = 10\\sqrt{2} \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the diagonal is \\( 10\\sqrt{2} \\) meters. Now, to find out how much distance I save, I need to subtract the diagonal distance from the sum of the two sides.\n\nSo, the distance saved is:\n\n\\[\n20 - 10\\sqrt{2} \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that numerically to get a better understanding. I know that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is approximately 1.414, so:\n\n\\[\n10\\sqrt{2} \\approx 10 \\times 1.414 = 14.14 \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the distance saved is:\n\n\\[\n20 - 14.14 = 5.86 \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, by walking diagonally, I save approximately 5.86 meters compared to walking along two sides.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the properties of squares or some other geometric principles?\n\nLet me think. In a square, the diagonal not only divides the square into two right-angled triangles but also bisects the angles. But I don't think that directly helps here.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the ratio of the diagonal to the side. I know that in a square, the diagonal is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) times the side length. So, if the side is 10 meters, the diagonal is \\( 10\\sqrt{2} \\) meters, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, to find the distance saved, I subtract the diagonal from the sum of two sides: \\( 20 - 10\\sqrt{2} \\) meters.\n\nI could also factor out 10:\n\n\\[\n10(2 - \\sqrt{2}) \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nThat's another way to express it, but the numerical value is probably more intuitive for understanding the savings.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the sum of two sides: 10 + 10 = 20 meters.\n\nDiagonal: \\( \\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{200} = 10\\sqrt{2} \\) meters.\n\nDifference: 20 - \\( 10\\sqrt{2} \\) meters.\n\nUsing \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\):\n\n20 - 14.14 = 5.86 meters.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nIs there any other aspect to this problem that I should consider? For example, is the ground perfectly flat, or is there any elevation change that might affect the actual walking distance? But based on the information given, it's a square garden with side lengths of 10 meters, so I think it's safe to assume it's flat.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"walking,\" so perhaps there are paths only along the sides and the diagonal, but since it's a garden, maybe there are obstacles or something. However, the problem doesn't specify any such constraints, so I'm assuming it's an open space.\n\nAnother thought: if the garden is a perfect square, are the sides exactly 10 meters? Maybe there's some tolerance or measurement error, but again, for the sake of this problem, I'll assume the sides are precisely 10 meters.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The main thing is to understand that walking along two sides covers a greater distance than walking diagonally across the square, and the difference is the distance saved.\n\nSo, to summarize, by walking diagonally across the square garden with side lengths of 10 meters, you save approximately 5.86 meters compared to walking along two sides.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe distance saved by walking diagonally across the square garden is \\( 20 - 10\\sqrt{2} \\) meters, which is approximately 5.86 meters."
