        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular room that's 12 feet long and 8 feet wide, and I need to cover the entire floor with square tiles without cutting any of them. I'm supposed to find out the largest possible size for each tile. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a floor that's rectangular, and I need to tile it completely with square tiles, meaning every part of the floor is covered, and none of the tiles are cut or broken. So, the tiles are all the same size, and they fit perfectly within the dimensions of the room.\n\nThe room is 12 feet long and 8 feet wide. Since the tiles are square, that means each tile has the same length and width, say 's' feet on each side. So, the area of each tile would be s squared, or s\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, do I need to consider the area here? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think differently.\n\nIf I'm laying out square tiles in a rectangular room without cutting any, that means the side length of the tile has to be a divisor of both the length and the width of the room. Because if I lay the tiles along the length, the total number of tiles along the length should be a whole number, and the same goes for the width.\n\nSo, the side length of the tile, s, has to be such that 12 divided by s is a whole number, and 8 divided by s is also a whole number. In other words, s has to be a common divisor of both 12 and 8.\n\nAnd since I'm looking for the largest possible tile, I need the largest possible s that satisfies this condition. So, essentially, I'm looking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 8.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both.\n\nFirst, list the divisors of 12:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nNow, list the divisors of 8:\n\n1, 2, 4, 8.\n\nNow, find the common divisors:\n\n1, 2, 4.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor is 4.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible side length for the square tiles is 4 feet.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's check.\n\nIf I have tiles that are 4 feet on each side, how many would I need along the length and the width?\n\nAlong the length: 12 feet / 4 feet per tile = 3 tiles.\n\nAlong the width: 8 feet / 4 feet per tile = 2 tiles.\n\nSo, 3 tiles along the length and 2 along the width, totaling 3 x 2 = 6 tiles.\n\nAnd since 4 is indeed a divisor of both 12 and 8, it should fit perfectly without any need to cut tiles.\n\nIs there a larger tile that could be used? Let's see, if I tried a 5-foot tile, for example:\n\n12 divided by 5 is 2.4, which is not a whole number, so I'd need to cut tiles, which is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, 6 feet:\n\n12 divided by 6 is 2, which is fine, but 8 divided by 6 is approximately 1.333, which isn't a whole number, so again, cutting would be needed.\n\n7 feet:\n\n12 divided by 7 is approximately 1.714, and 8 divided by 7 is approximately 1.142, neither of which are whole numbers.\n\n8 feet:\n\n12 divided by 8 is 1.5, and 8 divided by 8 is 1, but 1.5 isn't a whole number.\n\n9 feet and up would be even larger and wouldn't divide evenly into 12 or 8.\n\nSo, indeed, 4 feet is the largest possible tile size that fits both dimensions without needing to cut any tiles.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about this in terms of the least common multiple (LCM), but I think GCD is the right approach here.\n\nWait, actually, no. GCD is appropriate because we're looking for the largest tile that divides both dimensions evenly.\n\nIf I were trying to find the smallest area that could be tiled using both tile sizes, then LCM might come into play, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, to confirm, the largest square tile that can be used without cutting any tiles is 4 feet by 4 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\text{ feet}} \\]"
