The city currently has 100 diesel buses, and plans to replace them with electric buses over a period of 10 years. Each electric bus costs $500,000, while each diesel bus can be sold for $200,000. Additionally, the maintenance cost per year for an electric bus is $20,000, whereas it's $30,000 for a diesel bus. Calculate the total cost of this transition plan, considering both the purchase of new electric buses and the sale of old diesel buses, as well as the difference in annual maintenance costs."

        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the city wants to replace its 100 diesel buses with electric ones over 10 years. Each electric bus costs $500,000, and each diesel bus can be sold for $200,000. Also, the maintenance costs are $20,000 per year for electric buses and $30,000 for diesel buses. We need to find the total cost of this transition, considering both the purchase and sale of buses and the difference in maintenance costs.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the net cost of replacing one diesel bus with an electric bus. The cost to buy an electric bus is $500,000, and selling a diesel bus brings in $200,000. So, the net cost per bus is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net cost per bus} = \\$500,000 - \\$200,000 = \\$300,000 \\]\n\nSince there are 100 buses to replace, the total net cost for all buses would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total net cost for buses} = 100 \\times \\$300,000 = \\$30,000,000 \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the annual maintenance costs. Currently, with diesel buses, the maintenance cost is $30,000 per bus per year. With electric buses, it's $20,000 per bus per year. So, the annual savings per bus in maintenance is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual savings per bus} = \\$30,000 - \\$20,000 = \\$10,000 \\]\n\nHowever, since the replacement is happening over 10 years, we need to account for the fact that not all buses are replaced at once. Each year, the city replaces a certain number of buses. To find out how many buses are replaced each year, we divide the total number of buses by the number of years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Buses replaced per year} = \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\text{ buses/year} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the annual maintenance costs over the 10-year period. Each year, 10 buses are replaced with electric ones, and the remaining diesel buses continue to operate.\n\nLet's create a table to track the number of electric and diesel buses each year, along with the corresponding maintenance costs.\n\n| Year | Electric Buses | Diesel Buses | Total Maintenance Cost |\n|------|----------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| 1    | 10             | 90           | (10 \u00d7 $20,000) + (90 \u00d7 $30,000) = $200,000 + $2,700,000 = $2,900,000 |\n| 2    | 20             | 80           | (20 \u00d7 $20,000) + (80 \u00d7 $30,000) = $400,000 + $2,400,000 = $2,800,000 |\n| 3    | 30             | 70           | (30 \u00d7 $20,000) + (70 \u00d7 $30,000) = $600,000 + $2,100,000 = $2,700,000 |\n| 4    | 40             | 60           | (40 \u00d7 $20,000) + (60 \u00d7 $30,000) = $800,000 + $1,800,000 = $2,600,000 |\n| 5    | 50             | 50           | (50 \u00d7 $20,000) + (50 \u00d7 $30,000) = $1,000,000 + $1,500,000 = $2,500,000 |\n| 6    | 60             | 40           | (60 \u00d7 $20,000) + (40 \u00d7 $30,000) = $1,200,000 + $1,200,000 = $2,400,000 |\n| 7    | 70             | 30           | (70 \u00d7 $20,000) + (30 \u00d7 $30,000) = $1,400,000 + $900,000 = $2,300,000 |\n| 8    | 80             | 20           | (80 \u00d7 $20,000) + (20 \u00d7 $30,000) = $1,600,000 + $600,000 = $2,200,000 |\n| 9    | 90             | 10           | (90 \u00d7 $20,000) + (10 \u00d7 $30,000) = $1,800,000 + $300,000 = $2,100,000 |\n| 10   | 100            | 0            | (100 \u00d7 $20,000) + (0 \u00d7 $30,000) = $2,000,000 + $0 = $2,000,000 |\n\nNow, let's sum up the total maintenance costs over the 10 years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total maintenance cost} = \\$2,900,000 + \\$2,800,000 + \\$2,700,000 + \\$2,600,000 + \\$2,500,000 + \\$2,400,000 + \\$2,300,000 + \\$2,200,000 + \\$2,100,000 + \\$2,000,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total maintenance cost} = \\$25,500,000 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate what the total maintenance cost would have been if the city had continued using diesel buses for all 100 buses over 10 years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual maintenance with diesel} = 100 \\times \\$30,000 = \\$3,000,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total maintenance with diesel over 10 years} = 10 \\times \\$3,000,000 = \\$30,000,000 \\]\n\nSo, by transitioning to electric buses, the city saves:\n\n\\[ \\text{Maintenance savings} = \\$30,000,000 - \\$25,500,000 = \\$4,500,000 \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the net cost of the buses. We already calculated that the total net cost for replacing all 100 buses is \\$30,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the transition plan is the net cost of the buses plus the total maintenance cost over 10 years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total transition cost} = \\$30,000,000 + \\$25,500,000 = \\$55,500,000 \\]\n\nHowever, if we consider the maintenance savings, the net additional cost of the transition plan compared to continuing with diesel buses would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net additional cost} = \\$55,500,000 - \\$30,000,000 = \\$25,500,000 \\]\n\nBut I think the question is asking for the total cost of the transition plan, which includes both the capital expenditure (purchase of electric buses minus the sale of diesel buses) and the operational expenditure (maintenance costs over 10 years).\n\nSo, the total cost of the transition plan is \\$55,500,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{55500000} \\]"
