        "content": "So, we have a bag with different colored balls: 4 red, 5 blue, and 6 green. And we need to find the probability that a ball drawn at random is not blue. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to know the total number of balls in the bag. We can find this by adding up all the balls of each color:\n\nTotal balls = red balls + blue balls + green balls\nTotal balls = 4 + 5 + 6\nTotal balls = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 balls in total.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the ball drawn is not blue. One way to approach this is to find the probability of drawing a blue ball and then subtract that from 1, because the probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of it happening.\n\nSo, Probability(not blue) = 1 - Probability(blue)\n\nFirst, let's find Probability(blue).\n\nProbability of drawing a blue ball is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls.\n\nProbability(blue) = number of blue balls / total balls\nProbability(blue) = 5 / 15\nProbability(blue) = 1/3\n\nNow, Probability(not blue) = 1 - 1/3\nProbability(not blue) = 2/3\n\nAlternatively, we can directly calculate the probability of drawing a ball that is not blue by considering the number of non-blue balls.\n\nNumber of non-blue balls = total balls - blue balls\nNumber of non-blue balls = 15 - 5\nNumber of non-blue balls = 10\n\nSo, Probability(not blue) = number of non-blue balls / total balls\nProbability(not blue) = 10 / 15\nProbability(not blue) = 2/3\n\nBoth methods give us the same answer, which is 2/3.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWe have 4 red, 5 blue, and 6 green balls, totaling 15 balls.\n\nThe probability of not drawing blue can be found by either subtracting the probability of drawing blue from 1 or by directly using the number of non-blue balls.\n\nIn both cases, we get 2/3.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
