The most anticipated babies on the planet, but which star will top the SHOWBIZ Countdown, \"Battle of the Baby Bumps\"? Hello, I`m A.J. Hammer. From all of us here at SHOWBIZ TONIGHT, happy new year! And what a new year this is going to be for Kim Kardashian. Tonight in the SHOWBIZ Countdown, we`re revealing the top five must-see brand-new developments in the \"Battle of the Baby Bumps.\" Kim versus Jessica Simpson versus Kate Middleton. You know, just one of these ladies getting pregnant is enough to create a frenzy in its own right, but all three at the same time? What the heck is in the water? Megan Alexander is with me in New York. She`s correspondent for \"Inside Edition\" in Hollywood. Kristen Aldridge, who`s a host on OMG Now on Yahoo! Jenn Hobby is a host on Kicks 101.5 Radio in Atlanta. Ladies, great to have you here. Let`s kick it off, No. 5 on our SHOWBIZ Countdown, \"Battle of the Baby Bumps,\" with Kimye`s big announcement. One of the most interesting things for me about this mega baby battle is how her big news was actually revealed. Kanye West stunned his fans on Sunday night. This was at a concert in Atlantic City. He simply blurted out the bombshell baby news. This is priceless. Let`s watch. KANYE WEST, SINGER: Can we make some noise for my baby mama right quick? HAMMER: Yes, that was it: \"Make some noise for my baby mama.: I mean, Jenn, I`m thinking the guy obviously couldn`t contain his excitement. I will put aside for the moment that it wasn`t exactly the classiest way to let the world know he`s going to be a dad. But can you blame him? I mean, he was just out of his mind with excitement. JENN HOBBY, HOST, KICKS 101.5, ATLANTA: He was so excited about it. And it`s really cute, this genuine moment. Because you know, they had to be having meetings after meetings, planning sessions, how are they going to announce it, what sort of photo shoot was it going to be, which magazine and all that stuff. And he just blurted it out. I kind of love that`s the way that it happened. HAMMER: Yes, except for the use of the term \"baby mama,\" not really a highly regarded term. Maybe Kanye will reconsider that in the future. Megan, to you, the Kardashian family reportedly didn`t know that Kanye was going to let the cat out of the bag during this show. I got to believe that, you know, Mama Jenner, Kris Jenner`s head probably exploded when she found out that this happened. MEGAN ALEXANDER, CORRESPONDENT, \"INSIDE EDITION\": Absolutely. Quick damage control from Kris Jenner, picking up the phone, calling all the magazines. I`m sure she already had the press releases ready to go, A.J. So it`s just a matter of accessing the file on Kim`s baby. But still, yes, I think this happened a little quicker than they anticipated. Kim says she wanted to, you know, keep it quiet, I think, a few more weeks until her bump started showing, but it`s out and here we go. Kardashians, right? HAMMER: Right. She`ll be pretty quick to control the message from here on in, I think. It is pretty clear to me, however, that Jessica Simpson`s baby news announcement was more thoughtfully planned. She took to Twitter to confirm all of those reports that had been floating around that she`s expecting again. She shared this adorable picture of daughter Maxwell Drew. Look at that. That`s so cute. You see the words \"Big sis\" scribbled in the sand there. Kristen, I like how she did this. Very well done. KRISTEN ALDRIDGE, OMG NEWS ON YAHOO!: I totally agree with you, too, A.J. I mean, that couldn`t have been more adorable. I can`t think of anything better than announcing a pregnancy on Christmas, but, of course, we know that Jessica is kind of known for being clever. She announced her first pregnancy, I think, on Halloween with her mummy picture. So you know what? I`m really happy for the couple. I think they`re -- they`re really, really great parents. And Weight Watchers on the other hand, we`ve had reports that they may have been a little less than thrilled with the news, but they`re still showing their support, and I think we should, too. HAMMER: Yes, and we will be getting into that a little later tonight on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. Will they be sticking with Jessica? Will she stay on Weight Watchers? But now we move from the big announcements to a royal rivalry. This is No. 4 on our SHOWBIZ Countdown. America`s reality royalty versus Britain`s royal family. You all remember that when Will and Kate married, nearly 3 billion people reportedly tuned in to watch that magical day. That`s nearly half the people on the planet, right? And when Kim and her ex-, Kris Humphries, tied the knot, you had over 4 million people tuning in for their big reality TV extravaganza. So Jenn, everyone is going nuts over Kim getting pregnant. But I`m guessing her giving birth, it will be nothing compared to when Kate has her baby. HOBBY: That`s so true, A.J. The royal baby will have all the attention of not just the U.K. and not just the States, but the world. They are the real-life fairytale story, and now they`re welcoming a child into the world. So all eyes on the royal baby in 2013, for sure. HAMMER: Yes. And the timing, it`s kind of on par, here, with the duchess and Kim both reportedly about three months into their pregnancies, due at around the same time, Megan. So do I even have to ask you who tops this royal battle for you? I have a feeling it`s going to relate to somebody not native of this country. ALEXANDER: Exactly. I think there`s no competition, A.J., in terms of Kate and Will. An heir to the British throne, if you will. And Kate being so stylish, so classy, both of them handling themselves so well. I think we all enjoy watching the British family, how they deal with these sort of things. I think it`s going to be really fun to see these two as parents. HAMMER: It`s just going to be fun to watch the mayhem and the explosion in the media. Well, next in our SHOWBIZ Countdown of the \"Battle of the Baby Bumps,\" at No. 3, the fashion mogul versus the reality TV mogul. Jessica Simpson and Kim Kardashian certainly have both been criticized for oversharing in the past. But, you know, the fans just love that stuff. Right now Jessica has over 5 million Twitter followers, taking on Kim Kardashian`s over 17 million followers. And after Jessica tweeted this gorgeous picture of her daughter, she kept right on tweeting with this picture of her growing baby bump. Kristen, I actually think that Jessica is already giving Kim a run for her money when it comes to the whole baby battle here. ALDRIDGE: Wow. Do you really? I love it. First of all, the picture is amazing. She looks beautiful. She`s a proud mama. But we all know Kim Kardashian is the queen of oversharing, and when it comes to entertainment news, there`s nothing that I love more than baby bump sightings, because it gives me tons of awesome stuff to talk about on Yahoo! So I don`t know. I think Jessica is going to have to work a lot harder if she`s going to defeat reality royalty Kim Kardashian. HAMMER: I suppose that`s right. And as much as she was trying to keep things under wraps, the news finally came out, and Kim just spoke out for the first time about her pregnancy. She tells \"Entertainment Tonight\" that so far it actually hasn`t been easy. Let`s watch. KIM KARDASHIAN, REALITY TV STAR: People say pregnancy is, like, fun and they love it. I would have to disagree. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What? KARDASHIAN: You know, I mean, I think from this stage on it does become easier and funner [SIC], but, you know, it`s adjusting. And I think that so many times -- even my sisters made it look so easy. And it`s not as easy as people think. It is, you know, a little painful. HAMMER: OK. Now, here`s the thing. Here`s the thing. There are a whole lot of people out there who love Kim Kardashian and everything that the Kardashian family does, and they follow their every move. And then there are a whole lot of people out there who really don`t want to see yet another Kardashian moment. And now we`re going to have yet another Kardashian reality show entering the picture here, Jenn. It is insanity. How do you see this pregnancy playing out on TV? I mean, is she going to take us into the delivery room? Please say no. HOBBY: She will take us everywhere. This is what she does so brilliantly, is allow her fans into her life. And I`m expecting myself in 2013, and I am fascinated by this miracle growing in my body and all these things that my body is doing. But I don`t Instagram everything going on with myself and with my body and with this baby on the way. And so I know that Kim will be doing that, because that`s just what she does. ALEXANDER: Yes. HAMMER: Well, congratulations to you too, as well, Jenn. Maybe there are more people out there interested in your giving birth than Kim Kardashian. Who knows? Megan, what do you think? Because you know, we`ve been sitting here chatting about the Kardashians for years now. ALEXANDER: Yes. HAMMER: And, look, as much as people like to put them down and go after them, they obviously have a great number of fans, so this is going to be a huge boon to the Kardashian empire. ALEXANDER: I think it will. I mean, nobody knows how to capitalize on and monetize their fame like the Kardashians do. So every single one of them, every single aspect of their life they seem to capitalize on, A.J. But you know, one has to wonder at what point will they maybe regret sharing as much as they have? I don`t know. It`s full speed ahead right now. But there may come a time where they go, \"Ooh, did I really share that and say that?\" HAMMER: No, don`t say that. There are no regrets down the line for these guys. I have to tell you, I can`t imagine a day will come. Although maybe it will. Maybe Kim will have a mea culpa one day and who knows? Well, Megan, Jenn, Kristen, stay where you are, because we are not done yet. So if the all-too-surprising baby announcements and the royal rivalry aren`t No. 1 on the SHOWBIZ Countdown, what is? Well, I can tell you, it is a showdown between a fashion face-off and that coveted first baby photo. But which story is going to top the SHOWBIZ Countdown, \"Battle of the Baby Bumps\"? The big reveal is next. So as Kim shares her baby joy, is her mom`s marriage a total mess right now? Well, tonight, there are some new details coming out about Kris and Bruce Jenner. And it`s not just the first family of reality TV who spent the holidays breaking big news, we officially know what direction Taylor Swift`s love life is going in with Harry Stiles. Happy new year. Well, in this new year, there`s new love, and there`s new marriage meltdowns to talk about. More couples news than you can shake a prenup at.
