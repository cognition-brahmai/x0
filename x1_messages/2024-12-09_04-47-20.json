        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rectangular room with an area of 96 square meters and a perimeter of 40 meters. We need to find the dimensions, which means we need to find the length and the width of the room.\n\nFirst, I recall that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, if we let the length be L and the width be W, then:\n\nArea = L * W = 96\n\nAlso, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides, which is twice the length plus twice the width. So:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W = 40\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) L * W = 96\n\n2) 2L + 2W = 40\n\nI need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of L and W.\n\nLet me see. Maybe I can simplify the second equation. If I divide both sides by 2, I get:\n\nL + W = 20\n\nThat's nicer. So now I have:\n\n1) L * W = 96\n\n2) L + W = 20\n\nHmm, this looks familiar. It's like a system of equations where one is multiplicative and the other is additive.\n\nI think I can express one variable in terms of the other from the second equation and substitute into the first equation.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nL + W = 20\n\nLet's solve for L:\n\nL = 20 - W\n\nNow, substitute this expression for L into equation 1:\n\n(20 - W) * W = 96\n\nOkay, let's expand that:\n\n20W - W^2 = 96\n\nNow, let's rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation form:\n\n-W^2 + 20W - 96 = 0\n\nI prefer the coefficient of W^2 to be positive, so let's multiply the entire equation by -1:\n\nW^2 - 20W + 96 = 0\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation:\n\nW^2 - 20W + 96 = 0\n\nI can solve this quadratic equation for W using the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\nW = [20 \u00b1 sqrt(20^2 - 4*1*96)] / (2*1)\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant:\n\nDiscriminant = b^2 - 4ac = 400 - 384 = 16\n\nSo, W = [20 \u00b1 sqrt(16)] / 2 = [20 \u00b1 4] / 2\n\nThat gives two possible solutions:\n\nW = (20 + 4)/2 = 24/2 = 12\n\nW = (20 - 4)/2 = 16/2 = 8\n\nSo, W can be either 12 or 8.\n\nNow, recall that L = 20 - W.\n\nIf W = 12, then L = 20 - 12 = 8\n\nIf W = 8, then L = 20 - 8 = 12\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. Depending on which one you assign, the dimensions are 12 and 8, but one is length and the other is width.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the room are 12 meters and 8 meters.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure this makes sense.\n\nFirst, check the area: 12 * 8 = 96 square meters. That matches.\n\nSecond, check the perimeter: 2*12 + 2*8 = 24 + 16 = 40 meters. That also matches.\n\nGreat, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this problem differently. For example, I could have used the fact that for a given perimeter, the rectangle with the maximum area is a square. But in this case, since it's not a square, I needed to find the specific dimensions that give both the area and perimeter as specified.\n\nAnother way could be to use the equations directly. We have L * W = 96 and L + W = 20.\n\nI could have also thought of it as finding two numbers that multiply to 96 and add up to 20.\n\nLooking at the factors of 96:\n\n1 and 96\n\n2 and 48\n\n3 and 32\n\n4 and 24\n\n6 and 16\n\n8 and 12\n\nAh, there it is: 8 and 12 add up to 20.\n\nSo, again, the dimensions are 8 meters and 12 meters.\n\nThis confirms my earlier result.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. The dimensions of the room are 12 meters by 8 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12 \\text{ meters by } 8 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
