        "content": "So, I've got this question about a solar power plant. It says that it generates electricity at an average rate of 5 megawatts per hour and operates for 10 hours each day. I need to find out how much energy it produces in a year. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a megawatt is. I know that a watt is a unit of power, and a megawatt is a million watts. So, 5 megawatts is 5,000,000 watts. But actually, since we're dealing with energy production over time, I should remember that energy is power multiplied by time.\n\nThe power plant generates 5 MW per hour, but wait, that seems a bit confusing. Actually, power is measured in watts (or megawatts), and energy is measured in watt-hours (or megawatt-hours). So, if the plant generates 5 MW of power each hour, that means it's producing 5 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy each hour.\n\nOkay, so in one hour, it produces 5 MWh. And it operates for 10 hours each day. So, daily energy production would be 5 MWh/hour * 10 hours/day = 50 MWh/day.\n\nNow, to find out the annual production, I need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year, so 50 MWh/day * 365 days/year = 18,250 MWh/year.\n\nBut wait, I should consider whether it's a leap year or not. In a leap year, there are 366 days. But probably, for this calculation, assuming a non-leap year is fine, unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlso, sometimes energy production is calculated based on the capacity factor, but in this case, it's giving an average rate, so I think assuming constant production at that rate is acceptable.\n\nSo, the total energy produced in a year would be 18,250 megawatt-hours.\n\nBut maybe I should express it in other units as well for better understanding. For example, since 1 megawatt-hour is equal to 1,000 kilowatt-hours, 18,250 MWh would be 18,250,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh).\n\nAlternatively, in joules, since 1 kWh is equal to 3.6 million joules, but that might not be necessary for this question.\n\nI think 18,250 MWh per year is the primary answer, but knowing that it's equivalent to 18,250,000 kWh could also be helpful.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations:\n\n- 5 MW per hour means 5 MWh per hour.\n\n- 5 MWh/hour * 10 hours/day = 50 MWh/day.\n\n- 50 MWh/day * 365 days/year = 18,250 MWh/year.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the plant operates for 10 hours each day, that's 10 hours/day * 365 days/year = 3,650 hours/year.\n\nThen, at 5 MW for each of those hours, the total energy would be 5 MW * 3,650 hours = 18,250 MWh.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18250\\ \\text{MWh/year}} \\]"
