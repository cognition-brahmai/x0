        "content": "In Greek mythology, the god of dreams is Morpheus. He is known for shaping human dreams and is capable of taking human form in dreams to deliver messages or convey prophetic visions. However, it's worth noting that Morpheus is actually one of the sons of Hypnos, the god of sleep. Hypnos himself has several children who are personifications of different aspects of sleep and dreams, with Morpheus being responsible for creating human forms in dreams.\n\nBut if you're thinking of the god who sends prophetic dreams specifically, you might also be referring to Oneiroi, who are the gods of dreams in Greek mythology. The Oneiroi are often considered as a group of dream gods, and they were said to emerge from the underworld to visit mortals during sleep. Among them, Morpheus is the most famous for his ability to take human shape in dreams.\n\nAlternatively, in some traditions, it's Hypnos himself who is associated with sending dreams to mortals, often under the influence or direction of the Olympian gods. For instance, in Homer's \"Iliad,\" Zeus is said to send dreams to people through Hypnos.\n\nSo, while Morpheus is specifically the god of dreams and known for shaping human forms in dreams, the broader concept of prophetic dreams in Greek mythology involves multiple deities related to sleep and dreaming."
