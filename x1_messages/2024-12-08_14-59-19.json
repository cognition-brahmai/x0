        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, each starting from different cities and traveling towards each other. The first train is going at 60 miles per hour and it takes it 2 hours to travel between the two cities. So, the distance between the two cities should be speed times time, right? That would be 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nNow, the second train is traveling at 80 miles per hour, starting at the same time but from the opposite city. So, both trains are moving towards each other, covering the 120-mile distance.\n\nWhen two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, the relative speed here would be 60 mph plus 80 mph, which is 140 mph.\n\nTo find out when they will meet, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTime = 120 miles / 140 mph\n\nLet me calculate that. 120 divided by 140 is the same as 12/14, which simplifies to 6/7. So, the time is 6/7 of an hour.\n\nTo make it more understandable, let's convert that to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply 6/7 by 60.\n\n6/7 * 60 = (6*60)/7 = 360/7 \u2248 51.4286 minutes.\n\nSo, approximately 51.43 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the speeds and how much distance each train covers per hour.\n\nTrain A: 60 mph\n\nTrain B: 80 mph\n\nTogether, they cover 140 miles every hour.\n\nTotal distance is 120 miles.\n\nSo, time = distance / combined speed = 120 / 140 = 6/7 hour, which is about 51.43 minutes.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up an equation to find the time.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time until they meet as t hours.\n\nIn t hours, Train A will have traveled 60t miles.\n\nIn the same t hours, Train B will have traveled 80t miles.\n\nSince they are moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel should equal the total distance between the cities.\n\nSo:\n\n60t + 80t = 120\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n140t = 120\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\nt = 120 / 140 = 6/7 hour, which again is approximately 51.43 minutes.\n\nAlright, so no matter which method I use, I keep getting the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check the distance each train travels in that time and confirm that they add up to 120 miles.\n\nTrain A: 60 mph * 6/7 hour = 360/7 miles \u2248 51.4286 miles\n\nTrain B: 80 mph * 6/7 hour = 480/7 miles \u2248 68.5714 miles\n\nAdding those up: 51.4286 + 68.5714 = 120 miles exactly.\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nSo, the two trains will meet after approximately 51.43 minutes.\n\nWait, but maybe I should express it in hours and minutes, or just stick to one unit.\n\nIn the question, the first train takes 2 hours to travel between the cities, so perhaps keeping it in hours would be fine.\n\nBut since 6/7 of an hour is a bit unusual in everyday language, converting it to minutes might make more sense for clarity.\n\nAlternatively, I could express it as hours and minutes.\n\nLet's see: 6/7 hour is approximately 0.8571 hours.\n\nTo convert the decimal part to minutes, take 0.8571 * 60 \u2248 51.43 minutes.\n\nSo, it's about 51 minutes and 26 seconds (since 0.43*60 \u2248 26 seconds).\n\nBut maybe that level of precision isn't necessary.\n\nIn practical terms, saying they meet after approximately 51 minutes should suffice.\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with a physics or math problem, perhaps we should keep it at 6/7 hour or approximately 0.857 hours.\n\nBut I think providing both is helpful.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps we can consider the starting points and directions, but since the problem states they start at the same time from opposite cities and travel towards each other, I think our approach is correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that might affect the meeting time, like acceleration or stops, but the problem states constant speed, so no.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent is important. Here, everything is in miles and hours, so that's fine.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the concept of relative velocity. Since they're moving towards each other, the relative velocity is the sum of their speeds, which we used earlier.\n\nSo, yeah, I think our initial approach is solid.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Distance between cities: 120 miles\n\n- Train A: 60 mph\n\n- Train B: 80 mph\n\n- Relative speed: 140 mph\n\n- Time to meet: 120 / 140 = 6/7 hour \u2248 51.43 minutes\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet approximately 51.43 minutes after they start.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{6}{7} \\text{ hours} \\approx 51.43 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
