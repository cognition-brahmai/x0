        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car rental company charges $25 per day and an additional 15 cents per mile driven. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for 4 days and driving it for 350 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for the days rented. It's $25 per day for 4 days. So, that should be 25 multiplied by 4.\n\n25 * 4 = 100\n\nSo, the cost for the days is $100.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the cost for the miles driven. It's 15 cents per mile for 350 miles. Since 15 cents is the same as $0.15, I'll multiply 0.15 by 350.\n\n0.15 * 350 = 52.5\n\nSo, the cost for the miles is $52.50.\n\nNow, I'll add the two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\n100 + 52.5 = 152.5\n\nTherefore, the total rental cost will be $152.50.\n\nBut just to make sure, I'll double-check my calculations.\n\nDays rented: 4 days at $25 per day.\n\n25 * 4 = 100 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMiles driven: 350 miles at $0.15 per mile.\n\n0.15 * 350 = 52.5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTotal cost: 100 + 52.5 = 152.5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. The rental will cost $152.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{152.50} \\]"
