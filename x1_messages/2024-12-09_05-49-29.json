        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about planning a new sports complex, and there's a total budget of $5 million. The complex includes a soccer field, basketball courts, and a swimming pool, and there are percentages allocated for each part, plus some for landscaping and miscellaneous expenses. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much money is allocated to each part of the sports complex based on the percentages given. The soccer field gets 40% of the budget, basketball courts get 30%, the swimming pool gets 20%, and the remaining 10% is for landscaping and miscellaneous expenses.\n\nSo, the total budget is $5,000,000. That's $5 million.\n\nLet me start by calculating the budget for the soccer field. It's 40% of $5,000,000.\n\nTo find 40% of $5,000,000, I can multiply 5,000,000 by 0.40.\n\n5,000,000 * 0.40 = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, the soccer field will have a budget of $2,000,000.\n\nNext, the basketball courts get 30% of the budget.\n\nAgain, I'll multiply the total budget by 0.30.\n\n5,000,000 * 0.30 = 1,500,000.\n\nSo, the basketball courts will have a budget of $1,500,000.\n\nNow, the swimming pool gets 20% of the budget.\n\nMultiplying the total budget by 0.20:\n\n5,000,000 * 0.20 = 1,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the swimming pool will have a budget of $1,000,000.\n\nFinally, the remaining 10% is for landscaping and miscellaneous expenses.\n\nLet's calculate 10% of $5,000,000.\n\n5,000,000 * 0.10 = 500,000.\n\nSo, $500,000 is allocated for landscaping and miscellaneous expenses.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll add up all these amounts to make sure they total the $5,000,000 budget.\n\nSoccer field: $2,000,000\n\nBasketball courts: $1,500,000\n\nSwimming pool: $1,000,000\n\nLandscaping and miscellaneous: $500,000\n\nTotal: 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 = $5,000,000.\n\nPerfect, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Soccer field: $2,000,000\n\n- Basketball courts: $1,500,000\n\n- Swimming pool: $1,000,000\n\n- Landscaping and miscellaneous: $500,000\n\nI think that's everything. If there's anything else I need to consider, I'll look into it, but based on the information provided, this seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Soccer field: } \\$2,000,000, \\text{ Basketball courts: } \\$1,500,000, \\text{ Swimming pool: } \\$1,000,000, \\text{ Landscaping and miscellaneous: } \\$500,000} \\]"
