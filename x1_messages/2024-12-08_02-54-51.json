        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 5 red balls and 3 green balls. I'm supposed to draw one ball, replace it, and then draw another ball. I need to find out the probability that both balls drawn are red. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of balls in the bag. There are 5 red and 3 green, so total balls are 5 + 3 = 8 balls.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing a red ball in the first draw. Since there are 5 red balls out of 8 total balls, the probability is 5/8. Got it.\n\nNext, I replace the first ball back into the bag. So, the total number of balls remains the same, which is 8.\n\nNow, I draw the second ball. Again, the probability of drawing a red ball is 5/8, just like the first draw, because I replaced the first ball, and the conditions haven't changed.\n\nOkay, so I need both events to happen: first draw red AND second draw red. Since these are independent events (because I'm replacing the ball each time), I can multiply their probabilities to get the combined probability.\n\nSo, the probability of both balls being red is (5/8) * (5/8) = 25/64.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is it correct to multiply them because they are independent? Yeah, because replacing the ball ensures that the probability doesn't change for the second draw.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of possible outcomes. Each draw has 8 possible outcomes, and since I'm drawing twice with replacement, there are 8 * 8 = 64 possible outcomes in total.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to draw a red ball both times. Since there are 5 red balls, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 5 = 25.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes over total outcomes, which is 25/64. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't replace the ball, then the events would not be independent, and I'd have to adjust the probabilities accordingly. But in this case, since I am replacing, it's straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe using combinations?\n\nWell, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, but in this case, since I'm drawing one ball after another with replacement, order does matter in a way, but since I'm replacing, it's still independent events.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as with replacement, each draw is like drawing from the same pool every time.\n\nSo, the probability remains constant for each draw.\n\nTherefore, multiplying the probabilities makes sense.\n\nWait, another way: the probability of drawing two red balls in a row with replacement is (probability of red)^2, which is (5/8)^2 = 25/64.\n\nYeah, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. It's 25/64.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of percentages.\n\n5/8 is 62.5%, and 62.5% squared is approximately 39.0625%, which is roughly 25/64, since 25 divided by 64 is approximately 0.390625.\n\nYeah, that checks out.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. It seems straightforward because of the replacement.\n\nIf there was no replacement, then after drawing the first red ball, there would be 4 red balls left and total balls would be 7, so the second draw would have a probability of 4/7.\n\nBut since it's with replacement, it's always 5/8 for each draw.\n\nSo, the final answer is 25/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{64}} \\]"
