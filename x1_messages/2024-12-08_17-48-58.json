        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a train travels at an average speed of 60 kilometers per hour for 3 hours and 45 minutes. I need to find out how far it travels in kilometers. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nThe speed is given as 60 kilometers per hour, which is great because it's already in kilometers per hour, and I need the distance in kilometers. So, that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the time is 3 hours and 45 minutes. I need to make sure that the time is in hours since the speed is in kilometers per hour. So, I have to convert 45 minutes into hours.\n\nI know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert minutes to hours, I can divide the minutes by 60.\n\n\\[ 45 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 = 0.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, 45 minutes is equal to 0.75 hours.\n\nNow, I can add that to the 3 hours:\n\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} + 0.75 \\text{ hours} = 3.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the total time is 3.75 hours.\n\nNow, plugging back into the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\text{ km/h} \\times 3.75 \\text{ h} \\]\n\nMultiplying those together:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 3.75 = 225 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nSo, the train travels 225 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to think about how far the train travels in 3 hours and then in 45 minutes separately, and then add them up.\n\nFirst, in 3 hours at 60 km/h:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ km/h} \\times 3 \\text{ h} = 180 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nThen, in 45 minutes, which is 0.75 hours:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ km/h} \\times 0.75 \\text{ h} = 45 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n\\[ 180 \\text{ km} + 45 \\text{ km} = 225 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, that's good.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the entire time into minutes and then calculate, but that might be more complicated since the speed is given in kilometers per hour.\n\nLet's see: 3 hours and 45 minutes is equal to:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 60 + 45 = 180 + 45 = 225 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, the speed is 60 kilometers per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the speed in kilometers per minute would be:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ km/h} \\div 60 = 1 \\text{ km/min} \\]\n\nSo, at 1 kilometer per minute, over 225 minutes:\n\n\\[ 1 \\text{ km/min} \\times 225 \\text{ min} = 225 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nAgain, that's the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can consider the time in hours as a fraction.\n\n3 hours and 45 minutes is 3 and 45/60 hours, which simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 3 + \\frac{45}{60} = 3 + \\frac{3}{4} = 3.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThen, multiplying by speed:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 3.75 = 225 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nEverything points to 225 kilometers.\n\nI think that's the answer: 225 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{225} \\]"
