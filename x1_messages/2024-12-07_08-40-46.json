Each plan should correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of a specific function given an input string that could be the user question, previous evidence values, or a mix of both.\n\nAvailable tools:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: A tool that enables users to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. It helps locate potential websites that might contain answers to the user's query.\nWebReader[input]: Reads content from one or more websites specified in the input string (newline-separated links) and outputs the plain text content.\nURLCollector[input]: Collects URLs from plain text and generates a plain text, newline-separated list of links.\nBERT[input]: A question-answering language model effective at providing answers based on an input text passage. The input should be a text question referencing an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on :evidence0:'s result]\n:evidence1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, potentially referring to prior evidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:evidence[n]: with the final answer]\n\nQuestion: Who invented the telephone and what were their other significant contributions?"
