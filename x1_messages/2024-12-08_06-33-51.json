        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular field that's 150 meters long and 100 meters wide. The farmer wants to surround the entire field with a fence, and also divide it into three equal sections by adding two more fences parallel to the shorter side.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the field. It's a rectangle, so it has four sides: two lengths and two widths. The length is 150 meters, and the width is 100 meters. So, the perimeter of the field would be the sum of all four sides.\n\nBut wait, the farmer wants to divide the field into three equal sections using two additional fences parallel to the shorter side. Since the shorter side is the width (100 meters), these two fences will be parallel to the widths, meaning they will be running along the length of the field, which is 150 meters.\n\nSo, each of these two additional fences will be 150 meters long.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total fencing needed.\n\nFirst, the perimeter fence:\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (length + width) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (150 + 100) = 2 \\times 250 = 500 \\] meters.\n\nNext, the two additional fences:\n\nEach is 150 meters long, so together they are:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 150 = 300 \\] meters.\n\nNow, total fencing required is the sum of the perimeter fence and the two additional fences:\n\n\\[ 500 + 300 = 800 \\] meters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nAlternatively, since the two additional fences are parallel to the widths, they will be running along the length, dividing the field into three equal sections.\n\nSo, the field is 150 meters long, and we're dividing it into three equal sections. Each section would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{150}{3} = 50 \\] meters long.\n\nBut actually, no, wait. The fences are parallel to the widths, which means they are running along the length, so they are still 150 meters each.\n\nYes, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nTotal fencing is perimeter plus the two additional fences:\n\n500 meters (perimeter) + 300 meters (two fences of 150 meters each) = 800 meters.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the additional fences are inside the perimeter or not. Probably, they are inside, but still, they need fencing material, so it should be added to the total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the additional fences are shared with the perimeter, meaning that one of the perimeter fences is used as one of the divisions.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it seems that the two additional fences are separate from the perimeter fence.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"build a fence around the entire field but also wants to divide the field into three equal sections using two additional fences parallel to the shorter side.\"\n\nYes, \"additional\" fences, so in addition to the perimeter fence.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation seems correct: 500 meters for the perimeter plus 300 meters for the two additional fences, totaling 800 meters.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way to arrange the fencing, reducing the total amount needed.\n\nFor example, maybe some of the additional fences can coincide with the perimeter fences, but based on the problem, it seems that the additional fences are interior to the perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the farmer can arrange the fences in such a way that some sections are divided without adding extra fencing, but given the straightforward wording, I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the two additional fences are running parallel to the widths, effectively creating three equal sections along the length.\n\nSo, the field is 150 meters long, divided into three 50-meter sections by the two additional 150-meter fences.\n\nTherefore, the total fencing is indeed the perimeter plus the two additional fences: 500 + 300 = 800 meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the farmer can save some fencing by having the additional fences shared between sections, but in this scenario, since they are additional fences, it's likely that no fencing is being shared in that way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the additional fences are only needed between the sections, so if the field is divided into three sections, there would be two divisions, each 150 meters long.\n\nBut again, that aligns with my initial calculation.\n\nSo, I think 800 meters is the correct total amount of fencing needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"
