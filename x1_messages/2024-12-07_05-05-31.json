However, generally, the center core of a pineapple is considered to be the sweetest part. This area tends to be less fibrous and contains higher sugar concentrations compared to the outer layers. If you're planning to eat a pineapple, removing the outer skin and the tough eyes, and perhaps the harder central core depending on your preference, can help you enjoy the sweeter parts.\n"
