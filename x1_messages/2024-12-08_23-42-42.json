        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 students in total, and everyone plays at least one sport. Some play soccer, some play basketball, and some play both. I need to find out how many students play only one sport.\n\nFirst, I know that 18 students play soccer and 12 play basketball. But, 6 students play both sports. So, if I just add 18 and 12, that would be 30, which matches the total number of students, but that doesn't account for the overlap of students who play both sports.\n\nWait, actually, if I add 18 and 12, that's 30, which is the same as the total number of students, but since 6 students are playing both, they are being counted twice in that addition\u2014once in soccer and once in basketball. So, to find the total number of students playing at least one sport, I should add the number of soccer players and basketball players and then subtract those who play both to correct for double-counting.\n\nSo, the formula should be:\n\nTotal students = soccer players + basketball players - both sports players\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n30 = 18 + 12 - 6\n\nThat checks out because 18 plus 12 is 30, minus 6 for the double-counted students equals 24, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the total number of students is 30. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nLet me try again. The principle of inclusion-exclusion says that to find the total number of students playing at least one sport, you add the number of soccer players to the number of basketball players and subtract the number of students who play both.\n\nSo:\n\nTotal playing at least one sport = soccer + basketball - both\n\nWhich is 18 + 12 - 6 = 24\n\nBut the problem states that every student plays at least one sport, so there are 30 students, but according to this, only 24 play at least one sport, which contradicts the given information. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nHold on, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think differently. Maybe I need to find out how many students play only one sport, given that 6 play both.\n\nSo, the number of students who play only soccer would be total soccer players minus those who play both, which is 18 - 6 = 12\n\nSimilarly, the number of students who play only basketball would be 12 - 6 = 6\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who play only one sport would be those who play only soccer plus those who play only basketball, which is 12 + 6 = 18\n\nThat seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nTotal students = only soccer + only basketball + both\n\nWhich would be 12 (only soccer) + 6 (only basketball) + 6 (both) = 24\n\nBut the class has 30 students, so that would mean that 30 - 24 = 6 students are not accounted for. Wait, that can't be right because the problem says every student plays at least one sport.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me try calculating it differently.\n\nIf 18 play soccer and 6 of those also play basketball, then the number of students who play only soccer is 18 - 6 = 12\n\nSimilarly, if 12 play basketball and 6 of those also play soccer, then the number of students who play only basketball is 12 - 6 = 6\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play only one sport is 12 (only soccer) + 6 (only basketball) = 18\n\nAnd the number of students who play both sports is 6\n\nSo, total students playing at least one sport is 12 + 6 + 6 = 24\n\nBut the class has 30 students, which suggests that there might be a mistake because 24 \u2260 30\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. The problem states that every student plays at least one sport, and there are 30 students in total. According to my calculation, only 24 students are playing sports, which contradicts the given information.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently. Let me use the inclusion-exclusion principle again.\n\nTotal students = number playing soccer + number playing basketball - number playing both\n\nSo, 30 = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24\n\nWait, that gives me 24, but the total number of students is 30. This suggests that either the given numbers are incorrect or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\n\"In a class of 30 students, 18 play soccer, and 12 play basketball. If every student plays at least one sport and 6 students play both sports, how many students play only one sport?\"\n\nGiven that, my calculation seems correct: only soccer is 12, only basketball is 6, both is 6, total 24, but the class has 30 students. This implies that either the numbers provided are incorrect or there's additional information I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some students play other sports not mentioned here, but the problem says that every student plays at least one sport, implying that all students play either soccer, basketball, or both.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the total number of sport participations is more than the number of students due to some students playing multiple sports.\n\nWait, but that's already accounted for since students playing both sports are counted in both the soccer and basketball totals.\n\nGiven that, and applying the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of students playing at least one sport should be 18 + 12 - 6 = 24, but the class has 30 students, which doesn't make sense with the given condition that every student plays at least one sport.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding of it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to illustrate that not all students play sports, but the problem explicitly states that every student plays at least one sport.\n\nThis discrepancy is puzzling. Maybe I should consider that some students play other sports besides soccer and basketball, but the problem doesn't mention any other sports.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find only the number of students who play only one sport, regardless of the total number of students.\n\nGiven that, according to my earlier calculation, only one sport players are 12 (only soccer) + 6 (only basketball) = 18\n\nSo, the answer would be 18 students play only one sport.\n\nBut the discrepancy in the total number of students is still bothering me. Maybe I should seek clarification on whether all students are accounted for in the sports numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the number of students playing only one sport, and the total number of students is irrelevant for that calculation.\n\nGiven the information provided, and based on the inclusion-exclusion principle, my calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play only one sport is 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
