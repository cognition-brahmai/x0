        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains moving towards each other from Town A and Town B, which are 300 miles apart. The first train leaves Town A at 9 AM traveling at 60 mph, and the second train leaves Town B at the same time traveling at 90 mph. I need to find out when they will meet.\n\nFirst, I should understand that since both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds will add up. So, the relative speed at which they are approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds. That means 60 mph + 90 mph = 150 mph.\n\nNow, the total distance between them is 300 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 300 miles / 150 mph = 2 hours\n\nSo, it will take 2 hours for the two trains to meet.\n\nNow, since both trains left at 9 AM, I just need to add 2 hours to that time.\n\n9 AM + 2 hours = 11 AM\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet at 11 AM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how far each train travels in a certain amount of time and set up an equation where the sum of the distances equals 300 miles.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time in hours after 9 AM as t.\n\nSo, the distance traveled by the first train from Town A in time t is 60t miles.\n\nSimilarly, the distance traveled by the second train from Town B in time t is 90t miles.\n\nWhen they meet, the sum of these distances should be equal to the initial distance between Town A and Town B, which is 300 miles.\n\nTherefore, I can set up the equation:\n\n60t + 90t = 300\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n150t = 300\n\nNow, solving for t:\n\nt = 300 / 150 = 2 hours\n\nAgain, this confirms that it takes 2 hours for the trains to meet, which would be at 11 AM.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using relative speed again, but from a different perspective.\n\nSuppose I consider one train to be stationary and the other moving towards it at the combined speed. In that case, the relative speed is still 150 mph, and the time to cover 300 miles would still be 2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate how long it takes for each train to cover their respective portions of the distance, but that seems more complicated when they are moving towards each other.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can use the concept of time equals distance over speed for each train and set their times equal since they start at the same time and meet at the same time.\n\nWait, but that might not be directly applicable here because they are covering different distances.\n\nLet me try that approach anyway.\n\nLet\u2019s say the distance covered by the first train when they meet is d miles.\n\nThen, the distance covered by the second train would be 300 - d miles.\n\nThe time taken by the first train to cover d miles is d / 60 hours.\n\nThe time taken by the second train to cover 300 - d miles is (300 - d) / 90 hours.\n\nSince they meet at the same time, these times should be equal:\n\nd / 60 = (300 - d) / 90\n\nNow, solve for d.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n90d = 60(300 - d)\n\n90d = 18000 - 60d\n\nNow, add 60d to both sides:\n\n150d = 18000\n\nThen, divide both sides by 150:\n\nd = 18000 / 150 = 120 miles\n\nSo, the first train covers 120 miles, and the second train covers 300 - 120 = 180 miles.\n\nNow, to find the time, I can use the distance covered by either train divided by its speed.\n\nUsing the first train:\n\nTime = 120 miles / 60 mph = 2 hours\n\nOr using the second train:\n\nTime = 180 miles / 90 mph = 2 hours\n\nAgain, this confirms that it takes 2 hours for them to meet, which is at 11 AM.\n\nI think this is solid. I\u2019ve approached the problem from different angles and consistently gotten the same answer. It seems like the trains will meet at 11 AM.\n\nJust to be thorough, I\u2019ll consider if there\u2019s any possibility that their speeds or the distance could lead to a different meeting time.\n\nFor example, if one train was significantly faster, it might overtake the other, but in this case, they\u2019re moving towards each other, so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\nAlso, since both trains start at the same time and are moving at constant speeds, there shouldn\u2019t be any variables changing over time to affect the meeting time.\n\nTherefore, I\u2019m confident that 11 AM is the correct time when the two trains will meet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
