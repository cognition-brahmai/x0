This tool is beneficial for identifying a range of sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nLinkGrabber[input]: Grabs links from plain text and generates a plain text, newline separated response of links.\nWebReader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-separated links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nAIQA[input]: An artificial intelligence-based question-answering model, especially effective at answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who was Nikola Tesla and what were his major contributions to science?"
