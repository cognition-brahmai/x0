        "content": "The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, primarily occur in the Earth's ionosphere, which is a part of the upper atmosphere. More specifically, they happen at altitudes ranging from about 80 to 600 kilometers (50 to 370 miles) above the Earth's surface. The ionosphere is a region where solar radiation causes atoms and molecules to become ionized, creating a plasma of positively charged ions and free electrons.\n\nThe process that leads to the auroras starts when charged particles, mainly electrons and protons, are ejected from the sun during events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These particles are carried by the solar wind and interact with Earth's magnetic field, also known as the magnetosphere. The magnetic field guides these particles towards the Earth's poles, where they collide with atmospheric gases such as oxygen and nitrogen.\n\nThese collisions cause the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere to become excited and emit light, producing the colorful displays we see as auroras. The different colors correspond to different gases and altitudes: oxygen typically produces green and sometimes red light, while nitrogen can produce blue or purplish-red colors.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question, the Northern Lights occur in the ionosphere, which is a subset of the Earth's atmosphere."
