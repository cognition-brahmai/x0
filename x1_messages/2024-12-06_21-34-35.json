        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 50 red balls and 50 blue balls in a box, making a total of 100 balls. I'm supposed to pick one ball at random, look at its color, put it back, and repeat this process three times. I need to find out the probability that I pick a red ball all three times.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic probability of picking a red ball in a single trial. Since there are 50 red balls out of 100, the probability should be 50/100, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nNow, because I'm picking the ball with replacement, each pick is independent of the others. That means the outcome of one pick doesn't affect the outcomes of the next picks.\n\nSo, for three independent events, the probability of all of them happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet me denote the probability of picking a red ball as P(R). So, P(R) = 0.5.\n\nThen, the probability of picking a red ball three times in a row would be P(R) * P(R) * P(R) = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.5 * 0.5 is 0.25, and 0.25 * 0.5 is 0.125.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.125, which is the same as 12.5%.\n\nWait a minute, but probabilities are often expressed as fractions or percentages as well. So, 0.125 is the same as 1/8 or 12.5%.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning. Each pick is independent because I'm putting the ball back each time. So, the probability remains the same for each pick.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of combinations. But since the order matters here\u2014specifically, we want red every time\u2014perhaps the straightforward multiplication is the way to go.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to list all possible outcomes. Each pick has two possible outcomes: red or blue. So, for three picks, there are 2^3 = 8 possible sequences:\n\n1. Red, Red, Red\n\n2. Red, Red, Blue\n\n3. Red, Blue, Red\n\n4. Red, Blue, Blue\n\n5. Blue, Red, Red\n\n6. Blue, Red, Blue\n\n7. Blue, Blue, Red\n\n8. Blue, Blue, Blue\n\nOut of these eight possible sequences, only one is all reds. So, the probability should be 1/8, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI feel confident now that 0.125 or 1/8 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.125} \\]"
