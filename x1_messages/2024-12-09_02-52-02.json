        "content": "To calculate how many miles a person travels in a year by walking an average of 10,000 steps per day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the average length of a step in miles.\n2. Calculate the total number of steps taken in a year.\n3. Multiply the total number of steps by the average step length to get the total miles walked in a year.\n\nFirst, we need to know the average length of a step. On average, a person's step length is about 2.5 feet. Since there are 5,280 feet in a mile, we can calculate the number of steps in a mile:\n\nSteps per mile = 5,280 feet/mile \u00f7 2.5 feet/step = 2,112 steps/mile\n\nNow, if a person walks 10,000 steps per day, we can calculate the miles walked per day:\n\nMiles per day = 10,000 steps/day \u00f7 2,112 steps/mile \u2248 4.73 miles/day\n\nNext, to find out how many miles are walked in a year, we need to multiply the daily miles by the number of days in a year. Assuming a non-leap year with 365 days:\n\nTotal miles per year = 4.73 miles/day \u00d7 365 days/year \u2248 1,725.45 miles/year\n\nTherefore, a person who walks an average of 10,000 steps per day would travel approximately 1,725 miles in a year.\n\n**Note:** This calculation is based on average step length and does not account for variations in stride length, walking speed, or other individual differences.\n"
