        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 500 employees in a company, and the CEO decides to give everyone a bonus. But it's not an equal amount for everyone. Instead, each employee gets $100 more than the previous one. The first employee gets $200. I need to find out the total amount given in bonuses.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. This sounds like a sequence problem, specifically an arithmetic sequence, because each term (or in this case, each bonus) increases by a constant difference, which is $100.\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the nth term can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( a_n \\) is the nth term\n\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term\n\n- \\( n \\) is the term number\n\n- \\( d \\) is the common difference between the terms\n\nHere, \\( a_1 = 200 \\) (the first employee's bonus), \\( d = 100 \\) (each subsequent employee gets $100 more), and \\( n \\) ranges from 1 to 500 (since there are 500 employees).\n\nBut I need to find the total amount given in bonuses, which means I need to find the sum of the first 500 terms of this sequence.\n\nThe sum \\( s_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\n\\[ s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d) \\]\n\nI can use either formula. Maybe I'll use both to check if I'm getting the same answer.\n\nFirst, let's find \\( a_{500} \\), the bonus for the 500th employee.\n\nUsing the formula for the nth term:\n\n\\[ a_{500} = 200 + (500 - 1) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ a_{500} = 200 + 499 \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ a_{500} = 200 + 49,900 \\]\n\n\\[ a_{500} = 50,100 \\]\n\nNow, using the sum formula:\n\n\\[ s_{500} = \\frac{500}{2} \\times (200 + 50,100) \\]\n\n\\[ s_{500} = 250 \\times 50,300 \\]\n\n\\[ s_{500} = 12,575,000 \\]\n\nLet me verify this using the other sum formula:\n\n\\[ s_{500} = \\frac{500}{2} \\times (2 \\times 200 + (500 - 1) \\times 100) \\]\n\n\\[ s_{500} = 250 \\times (400 + 49,900) \\]\n\n\\[ s_{500} = 250 \\times 50,300 \\]\n\n\\[ s_{500} = 12,575,000 \\]\n\nGreat, both methods give me the same total: $12,575,000.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's see: the first employee gets $200, the second gets $300, the third gets $400, and so on, up to the 500th employee getting $50,100. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, confirming \\( a_{500} \\):\n\n\\[ a_{500} = 200 + 499 \\times 100 = 200 + 49,900 = 50,100 \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the sum:\n\n\\[ s_{500} = \\frac{500}{2} \\times (200 + 50,100) = 250 \\times 50,300 = 12,575,000 \\]\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\\[ s_{500} = \\frac{500}{2} \\times (400 + 49,900) = 250 \\times 50,300 = 12,575,000 \\]\n\nBoth ways, I end up with $12,575,000.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series in a different way or see if there's another approach to confirm this result.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that in an arithmetic sequence, the sum is equal to the number of terms multiplied by the average of the first and last terms.\n\nSo, \\( s_n = n \\times \\frac{a_1 + a_n}{2} \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ s_{500} = 500 \\times \\frac{200 + 50,100}{2} = 500 \\times \\frac{50,300}{2} = 500 \\times 25,150 = 12,575,000 \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me more confidence that $12,575,000 is the correct total bonus amount.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says \"each employee gets $100 more than the previous employee,\" starting with $200 for the first employee. It's clear that it's an arithmetic progression with a common difference of $100.\n\nI don't think there's any ambiguity in the problem statement regarding the sequence of bonuses.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what the sum would be if the first employee got $200 and each subsequent employee got $100 more.\n\nSo, employee 1: $200\n\nEmployee 2: $300\n\nEmployee 3: $400\n\n...\n\nEmployee 500: $200 + 499*$100 = $50,100\n\nSum = $200 + $300 + $400 + ... + $50,100\n\nThis is indeed an arithmetic series with first term 200, last term 50,100, and number of terms 500.\n\nUsing the sum formula for an arithmetic series:\n\n\\[ s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\n\\[ s_{500} = \\frac{500}{2} \\times (200 + 50,100) = 250 \\times 50,300 = 12,575,000 \\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI think $12,575,000 is the correct total amount given in bonuses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12575000} \\]"
