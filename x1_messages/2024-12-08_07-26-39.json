        "content": "In baseball, the term \"touch home\" or more commonly, \"touching home,\" is used when a runner successfully reaches home plate, scoring a run. This action is crucial in the game as it directly contributes to a team's score. The concept has been extended metaphorically into everyday language, where \"touching home\" or \"hitting home\" can mean achieving success or reaching a goal in a broader context, not just limited to sports. So, in this idiom, \"home\" symbolizes the achievement of a desired objective or the realization of a goal."
