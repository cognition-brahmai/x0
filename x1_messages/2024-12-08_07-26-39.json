        "content": "Let's see. I have this game with different outcomes and their probabilities. I need to find the expected value of playing this game. Expected value is like the average outcome if I play the game many times, right?\n\nSo, there are three possible outcomes:\n\n1. Winning $50 with a probability of 1/5.\n\n2. Winning $100 with a probability of 1/10.\n\n3. Losing $20 with a probability of 7/10.\n\nTo find the expected value, I need to multiply each outcome by its probability and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's handle the winnings:\n\nWinning $50 with a probability of 1/5:\n\n$50 * (1/5) = $10.\n\nWinning $100 with a probability of 1/10:\n\n$100 * (1/10) = $10.\n\nNow, for losing $20 with a probability of 7/10:\n\n-$20 * (7/10) = -\\$14.\n\nWait, since it's a loss, I should represent it as negative $20.\n\nNow, I'll add these up:\n\n$10 (from the first win) + $10 (from the second win) + (-$14) (from the loss) = $10 + $10 - $14 = $6.\n\nSo, the expected value for playing this game is $6.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, $50 times 1/5 is indeed $10.\n\nSecond, $100 times 1/10 is also $10.\n\nThird, -$20 times 7/10 is -$14.\n\nAdding $10 + $10 is $20, and then subtracting $14 gives $6.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of fractions to verify.\n\nLet me convert all the probabilities to decimals for clarity.\n\n1/5 is 0.2.\n\n1/10 is 0.1.\n\n7/10 is 0.7.\n\nSo, expected value E = (50 * 0.2) + (100 * 0.1) + (-20 * 0.7).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n50 * 0.2 = 10.\n\n100 * 0.1 = 10.\n\n-20 * 0.7 = -14.\n\nSumming them up: 10 + 10 - 14 = 6.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of percentages.\n\n1/5 is 20%.\n\n1/10 is 10%.\n\n7/10 is 70%.\n\nSo, 20% chance to win $50, 10% chance to win $100, and 70% chance to lose $20.\n\nExpected value E = (0.2 * 50) + (0.1 * 100) + (0.7 * (-20)) = 10 + 10 - 14 = 6.\n\nConsistent again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of fractions.\n\nExpected value E = (1/5)*50 + (1/10)*100 + (7/10)*(-20).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(1/5)*50 = 10.\n\n(1/10)*100 = 10.\n\n(7/10)*(-20) = -14.\n\nSumming them up: 10 + 10 - 14 = 6.\n\nSame answer.\n\nI think I've verified it enough.\n\nSo, the expected value for playing this game is $6.\n\nThat means, on average, I would expect to gain $6 per game if I played many times.\n\nBut wait, is there any other way to look at this?\n\nLet me consider the probabilities adding up to 1.\n\n1/5 + 1/10 + 7/10 = 2/10 + 1/10 + 7/10 = 10/10 = 1.\n\nGood, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the expected value in terms of utility or something, but I think for this basic problem, $6 is the correct expected value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simulate it.\n\nSuppose I play the game 10 times.\n\nExpected number of times I win $50: 10 * 1/5 = 2 times, totaling $100.\n\nExpected number of times I win $100: 10 * 1/10 = 1 time, totaling $100.\n\nExpected number of times I lose $20: 10 * 7/10 = 7 times, totaling -$140.\n\nTotal expected money: $100 + $100 - $140 = $60.\n\nSo, average per game: $60 / 10 = $6.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I play 100 times.\n\nExpected wins of $50: 100 * 1/5 = 20 times, $1000.\n\nWins of $100: 100 * 1/10 = 10 times, $1000.\n\nLosses of $20: 100 * 7/10 = 70 times, -$1400.\n\nTotal: $1000 + $1000 - $1400 = $600.\n\nAverage per game: $600 / 100 = $6.\n\nConsistent again.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the expected value is $6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
