Degas is renowned for his depictions of ballet dancers, capturing their movements and the atmosphere of the ballet world with great sensitivity and detail. His works also often featured scenes from Parisian life, such as cafe interiors and urban landscapes. His unique style and subject matter have made him one of the most recognized artists of the 19th century."
