        "content": "So I've got this problem about a rectangular garden. It says that the length is 4 meters more than its width, and the area is 60 square meters. I need to find the dimensions, which means I need to find both the length and the width. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, area = length \u00d7 width. That's a start. Now, the problem gives me a relationship between the length and the width: the length is 4 meters more than the width. So, if I let the width be some value, say w meters, then the length would be w + 4 meters.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Width = w meters\n- Length = w + 4 meters\n- Area = 60 square meters\n\nNow, plugging these into the area formula:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n60 = (w + 4) \u00d7 w\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation: (w + 4) \u00d7 w = 60. I need to solve for w. Let's expand this equation.\n\nw(w + 4) = 60\nw\u00b2 + 4w = 60\n\nNow, to form a standard quadratic equation, I'll move 60 to the left side:\n\nw\u00b2 + 4w - 60 = 0\n\nGreat, so now I have a quadratic equation: w\u00b2 + 4w - 60 = 0. I need to solve for w. I can do this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -60 and add up to 4. Let's see:\n\nPossible factor pairs of -60:\n- 1 and -60\n- 2 and -30\n- 3 and -20\n- 4 and -15\n- 5 and -12\n- 6 and -10\n- And their negative counterparts.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -60 and add up to 4. Hmm, 10 and -6: 10 \u00d7 -6 = -60, and 10 + (-6) = 4. Perfect!\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic equation as:\n\n(w + 10)(w - 6) = 0\n\nNow, setting each factor equal to zero gives me the possible solutions for w:\n\nw + 10 = 0 \u21d2 w = -10\nw - 6 = 0 \u21d2 w = 6\n\nNow, since width cannot be negative (as physical dimensions can't be negative), I'll discard w = -10. So, w = 6 meters.\n\nNow, to find the length, which is w + 4:\n\nLength = 6 + 4 = 10 meters.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 6 meters in width and 10 meters in length.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure this is correct. If width is 6 meters and length is 10 meters, then the area would be 6 \u00d7 10 = 60 square meters, which matches the given area. Also, the length is indeed 4 meters more than the width, since 10 - 6 = 4 meters. So, everything checks out.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the quadratic formula to solve for w. The quadratic equation is w\u00b2 + 4w - 60 = 0. The quadratic formula is:\n\nw = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 4, and c = -60. Plugging in these values:\n\nw = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a(4\u00b2 - 4\u00d71\u00d7(-60))] / (2\u00d71)\nw = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 240)] / 2\nw = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a256] / 2\nw = [-4 \u00b1 16] / 2\n\nNow, calculating both possibilities:\n\n1. w = (-4 + 16) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6\n2. w = (-4 - 16) / 2 = -20 / 2 = -10\n\nAgain, discarding the negative solution, I get w = 6 meters, which matches my previous result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method I use, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any other possible interpretation of the problem. The problem states that the length is 4 meters more than the width, and the area is 60 square meters. I've taken length to be the longer side, which is standard, but just to be sure, I'll confirm.\n\nIn a rectangle, the length is usually the longer side, and the width is the shorter one. However, in some contexts, this might not always be the case. But given that the length is specified as 4 meters more than the width, it implies that the length is indeed longer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the variables differently. For example, some people might prefer to let the length be l and the width be w, with l = w + 4. But I chose to let width be w and length be w + 4, which seems consistent.\n\nI could also draw a diagram to visualize this. Let's sketch a rectangle, labeling one side as width (w) and the adjacent side as length (w + 4). Inside the rectangle, I can note that the area is 60 square meters.\n\n```\n\n  +---------------+\n  |               |\n  |               | w + 4\n  |               |\n  +---------------+\n        w\n\nArea = w \u00d7 (w + 4) = 60\n\n```\n\nThis visual representation helps confirm that my setup is correct.\n\nNow, to make sure there are no calculation errors, let's revisit the quadratic equation solving.\n\nStarting from:\n\nw\u00b2 + 4w - 60 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nw = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 240)] / 2\nw = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a256] / 2\nw = [-4 \u00b1 16] / 2\n\nSo, w = (12)/2 = 6 or w = (-20)/2 = -10\n\nAgain, w = 6 is the valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, if I complete the square for the quadratic equation:\n\nw\u00b2 + 4w - 60 = 0\n\nFirst, move the constant term to the other side:\n\nw\u00b2 + 4w = 60\n\nNow, to complete the square, add (b/2)\u00b2 to both sides. Here, b is 4, so (4/2)\u00b2 = 4.\n\nw\u00b2 + 4w + 4 = 60 + 4\n(w + 2)\u00b2 = 64\n\nNow, taking square roots:\n\nw + 2 = \u00b1\u221a64\nw + 2 = \u00b18\n\nSo, w + 2 = 8 \u21d2 w = 6\nor w + 2 = -8 \u21d2 w = -10\n\nAgain, w = 6 is the valid solution.\n\nIt's reassuring that all these different methods lead to the same answer.\n\nLet me also consider if there's a way to solve this without using quadratic equations. Maybe by guessing and checking, but that might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, I could try different integer values for width and see if the corresponding length gives an area of 60.\n\nStart with w = 5:\n\nl = 5 + 4 = 9\n\nArea = 5 \u00d7 9 = 45, which is less than 60.\n\nTry w = 6:\n\nl = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nArea = 6 \u00d7 10 = 60, which matches.\n\nSo, again, w = 6 meters is confirmed.\n\nAlternatively, w = 7:\n\nl = 7 + 4 = 11\n\nArea = 7 \u00d7 11 = 77, which is more than 60.\n\nSo, w = 6 is indeed the correct width.\n\nI think I've thoroughly verified that the width is 6 meters and the length is 10 meters.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me consider the perimeter as well, although it's not asked for in the problem.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w.\n\nSo, P = 2\u00d710 + 2\u00d76 = 20 + 12 = 32 meters.\n\nBut since the problem only asks for the dimensions, and I've already found that the width is 6 meters and the length is 10 meters, with the area being 60 square meters, which satisfies the given conditions, I can confidently state the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe dimensions of the garden are \\boxed{6 \\text{ meters by } 10 \\text{ meters}}."
