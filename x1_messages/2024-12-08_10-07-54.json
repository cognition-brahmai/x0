        "content": "Yes, it is possible for hair to turn white overnight due to extreme stress or fear. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"overnight graying\" or \"canities subita.\" While it may seem like an urban legend, there are documented cases where individuals have experienced sudden and significant graying of their hair in a short period, sometimes even overnight.\n\nThe exact mechanism behind this is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the body's response to extreme stress or trauma. When a person experiences intense stress or fear, the body releases hormones like cortisol and adrenaline as part of the fight-or-flight response. These hormones can have various effects on the body, including impacting hair growth and pigmentation.\n\nOne theory suggests that extreme stress can cause the hair follicles to prematurely exhaust their supply of melanin, the pigment responsible for hair color. As a result, new hair that grows in lacks pigment and appears white or gray. Another theory proposes that stress may cause the hair follicles to enter the resting phase (telogen) more rapidly, leading to a higher rate of hair shedding and the appearance of new, unpigmented hairs.\n\nIt's important to note that while overnight graying is possible, it is relatively rare. Most cases of hair graying occur gradually over time as part of the natural aging process. However, stress and other environmental factors can accelerate this process.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing significant stress or anxiety, it's essential to seek support and consider stress management techniques to promote overall well-being."
