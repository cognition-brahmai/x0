        "content": "So the problem is about figuring out how many candies of each type A, B, and C were sold, given that their sales are in the ratio 2:3:5 and the total candies sold in a day are 500. Okay, ratios can be a bit tricky, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio means. The ratio 2:3:5 for candies A, B, and C means that for every 2 candies of type A sold, there are 3 of type B and 5 of type C sold. So, it's like dividing the total candies into parts where A gets 2 parts, B gets 3 parts, and C gets 5 parts.\n\nTo find out how many candies of each type were sold, I need to determine the value of one part and then multiply it by the number of parts for each type.\n\nLet's denote the number of parts for A as 2x, for B as 3x, and for C as 5x, where x is the common multiplier.\n\nThe total number of candies sold is the sum of A, B, and C:\n\n2x + 3x + 5x = 500\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n10x = 500\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 500 / 10\n\nx = 50\n\nNow that I have the value of x, I can find the number of candies of each type:\n\nA: 2x = 2 * 50 = 100\n\nB: 3x = 3 * 50 = 150\n\nC: 5x = 5 * 50 = 250\n\nSo, the store sold 100 candies of type A, 150 of type B, and 250 of type C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check if this adds up to 500:\n\n100 + 150 + 250 = 500\n\nYes, it does. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio as fractions of the total. The total parts are 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts.\n\nSo, candy A is 2/10 of the total, B is 3/10, and C is 5/10.\n\nThen, candies sold:\n\nA: (2/10) * 500 = 100\n\nB: (3/10) * 500 = 150\n\nC: (5/10) * 500 = 250\n\nSame results as before. Good, it consistency checks out.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the ratio or if there are any tricks in the problem that I might have missed.\n\nThe problem is straightforward: it directly gives the ratio and the total, and asks for the number of each type. No additional constraints or conditions are mentioned, so I don't think there's any trick here.\n\nIt's also important to ensure that the numbers make sense in the context of the problem. Since we're dealing with candies, which are discrete items, having whole numbers makes sense. In this case, all the quantities are whole numbers, which is appropriate.\n\nIf the total or the ratio were such that multiplying by x resulted in fractions, that might indicate an error or a need to interpret the results differently. But here, everything works out nicely.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the store sold 100 candies of type A, 150 of type B, and 250 of type C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\text{ candies of type A}, 150 \\text{ candies of type B}, 250 \\text{ candies of type C}} \\]"
