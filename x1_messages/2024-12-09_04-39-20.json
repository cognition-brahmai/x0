        "content": "Dear Diary,\n\nAnother night, another outburst. I can't keep doing this. The rage consumes me, and before I know it, I've turned into... him. The Hulk. Again. It's like I have no control over myself. One minute, I'm trying to be peaceful, the next, I'm smashing everything in sight.\n\nI know people are scared of me. Even my friends. They don't know when I'm going to snap. And honestly, neither do I. It's like there's this constant battle going on inside me\u2014Bruce versus the Hulk. Sometimes, I feel like I'm losing that battle.\n\nToday was supposed to be different. I promised myself that I would stay calm, no matter what. But then that guy started yelling at me, accusing me of things I didn't do. His words were like fuel to the fire, and before I could stop it, the Hulk was breaking through again.\n\nI remember feeling the anger rising, my heart pounding in my chest. I tried to breathe, to think, but it was no use. The Hulk took over, and I lost myself in his fury. When I came to, I was standing in the middle of the destroyed street, surrounded by shocked faces. Again.\n\nI don't know how many more times I can do this. How many more times I can hurt people, even if it's not on purpose. It's not just about the property damage; it's about the pain I cause to those around me. My friends, my loved ones, they suffer because of me.\n\nI've tried everything to control it. Therapy, meditation, even medication. Nothing seems to work. The Hulk is always there, waiting for the slightest provocation to break free. It's like he's a part of me that can never be tamed.\n\nBut maybe that's not entirely true. There have been moments, rare moments, where I've managed to keep him at bay. Where I've faced my anger and found a way to channel it differently. Maybe that's the key\u2014finding healthier ways to express my frustration without losing myself completely.\n\nI need to talk to someone about this. Someone who understands what I'm going through. Maybe Dr. Banner can help. He's been studying the Hulk for years; perhaps he has some insights I haven't considered yet.\n\nUntil then, I guess I just have to keep trying. Keep fighting the good fight, even when it feels like I'm losing all the time. Because giving up isn't an option. Not when there are people who care about me, who believe in me, even when the Hulk takes over.\n\nMaybe one day, I'll find a way to live with this dual nature. Until then, I'll keep writing in this diary, pouring out my struggles and hopes, hoping that someday things will get better.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBruce Banner (a.k.a. The Hulk)"
