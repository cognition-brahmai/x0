        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression is:\n\n((4 * 3)^2 - 5 * 7) / (9 - 6)\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate 4 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(12^2 - 5 * 7) / (9 - 6)\n\n2. Next, handle the exponent:\n\n12^2 = 144\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(144 - 5 * 7) / (9 - 6)\n\n3. Then, perform the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n5 * 7 = 35\n\nNow it's:\n\n(144 - 35) / (9 - 6)\n\n4. Subtract within the first parentheses:\n\n144 - 35 = 109\n\nAnd within the second parentheses:\n\n9 - 6 = 3\n\nSo now we have:\n\n109 / 3\n\n5. Finally, perform the division:\n\n109 \u00f7 3 = 36.333...\n\nSo the final answer is approximately 36.333, or you can express it as 36 and one-third.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36.\\overline{3}} \\]"
