Crystal balls have been used for centuries in various cultures for divination or fortune-telling, but there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that they can actually show the future. Divination practices, including those involving crystal balls, are generally considered to be forms of superstition or entertainment rather than reliable methods for predicting events. It's important to approach such claims with a critical mind and rely on evidence-based information for decision-making."
