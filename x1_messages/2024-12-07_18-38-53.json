However, I can tell you that thunderstorms are a natural phenomenon that occur in many parts of the world, especially in areas with high humidity and temperature variations. It is unlikely that there is a location where it never stops thundering, as weather patterns are constantly changing and thunderstorms are typically localized events that last for a few hours at most. It's always important to stay informed about weather conditions in your area and take appropriate precautions during thunderstorms."
