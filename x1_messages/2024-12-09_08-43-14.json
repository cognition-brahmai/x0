        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to find out how many handshakes occur in total.\n\nFirst, I think about how many hands each person shakes. If there are 10 people, then each person shakes hands with 9 other people, right? Because they don't shake their own hand.\n\nSo, if each of the 10 people shakes hands with 9 others, that would be 10 times 9, which is 90 handshakes. But wait, that seems too high. I think I'm double-counting here.\n\nLet me think again. When person A shakes hands with person B, that's one handshake, not two. So, in my previous calculation, I counted it once for person A and once for person B, which is double-counting.\n\nTo correct for that, I need to divide the total by 2. So, 90 divided by 2 is 45.\n\nIs there a formula for this? I think there is. It's about combinations, right? Choosing 2 people out of 10 to shake hands.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n is 10 and k is 2, because we're choosing 2 people to shake hands.\n\nSo, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)).\n\nWait, that seems complicated. I can simplify it.\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to think about it? Maybe using patterns or sequences.\n\nLet me see. If there are 2 people, there's 1 handshake.\n\nWith 3 people, there are 3 handshakes.\n\nWith 4 people, there are 6 handshakes.\n\nI notice a pattern: 1, 3, 6, 10, and so on, which are triangular numbers.\n\nThe formula for the nth triangular number is n(n - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for 10 people, it would be 10 \u00d7 9 / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using recursion.\n\nSuppose I know the number of handshakes for n - 1 people, and I add one more person. How many new handshakes are there?\n\nWell, the new person shakes hands with each of the existing n - 1 people.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes for n people is the number for n - 1 people plus n - 1.\n\nLet me write that as h(n) = h(n - 1) + (n - 1), where h(n) is the number of handshakes for n people.\n\nWith h(2) = 1.\n\nThen, h(3) = h(2) + 2 - 1 = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nh(4) = h(3) + 3 - 1 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nh(5) = h(4) + 4 - 1 = 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nContinuing this way up to h(10):\n\nh(6) = h(5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nh(7) = h(6) + 6 = 15 + 6 = 21.\n\nh(8) = h(7) + 7 = 21 + 7 = 28.\n\nh(9) = h(8) + 8 = 28 + 8 = 36.\n\nh(10) = h(9) + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45.\n\nAgain, 45 handshakes.\n\nIs there a way to generalize this recursive formula to a closed-form formula?\n\nYes, the recursive formula h(n) = h(n - 1) + (n - 1) can be summed up.\n\nh(n) = h(1) + \u03a3(i from 1 to n-1) i.\n\nBut h(1) is 0, since one person can't shake hands with anyone else.\n\nSo, h(n) = \u03a3(i from 1 to n-1) i = (n - 1)n / 2.\n\nWhich is the same as C(n, 2), the number of ways to choose 2 people out of n.\n\nSo, for n = 10, h(10) = (10 - 1) \u00d7 10 / 2 = 9 \u00d7 10 / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\n\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f45\u6b21\u63e1\u624b\u3002\n\n\u8ba9\u6211\u518d\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u623f\u95f4\u91cc\u670910\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u63e1\u624b\u4e00\u6b21\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u6211\u90fd\u5f97\u5230\u4e8645\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u770b\u6765\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u603b\u7684\u63e1\u624b\u6b21\u6570\u662f45\u6b21\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
