        "content": "Let's see. So, astronomy is all about studying stuff in space like stars, planets, and everything else up there. And astrophysics is a part of astronomy that uses physics to understand how these things work. So, it's like using the rules of physics to figure out what's going on in the universe.\n\nFor example, thermodynamics is a part of physics that deals with heat and energy. Astrophysicists use thermodynamics to understand how stars are born, live their lives, and die. It's pretty cool because stars are like big balls of gas that are constantly undergoing nuclear reactions, and thermodynamics helps explain how they generate energy and why they behave the way they do.\n\nNow, observational techniques in astronomy involve using telescopes and other instruments to collect data about these celestial objects. So, it's not just theory; it's also about observing what's actually happening in the sky.\n\nThe question is asking which of the options would most likely be studied using the principles of astrophysics. Let's look at each one:\n\nA. The design of telescopes\n\nThis seems more related to engineering and perhaps some physics, but it's not directly about studying celestial objects using physics principles. It's more about building the tools to observe them.\n\nB. The mapping of stars in the night sky\n\nMapping stars is more about astronomy\u2014recording their positions and movements. While physics might be involved in understanding why they're where they are, the act of mapping is more about observation and recording data.\n\nC. The rotation of the Earth\n\nThe rotation of the Earth is certainly a topic in astronomy and physics, but it's more about our planet specifically. Astrophysics tends to look at broader phenomena in the universe, though it does include the study of planets. Still, compared to the other options, it might not be the best fit.\n\nD. The life cycle of stars\n\nThis seems like a perfect fit for astrophysics. Since astrophysics uses physics to understand celestial objects, and the life cycle of stars is all about their birth, evolution, and death, which are processes explained by physical laws, particularly thermodynamics and nuclear physics.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is D. The life cycle of stars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n"
