        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a sphere has a surface area of 314 square centimeters, and I need to find its radius and volume. Okay, let's start by recalling the formulas for the surface area and volume of a sphere.\n\nThe surface area \\( A \\) of a sphere is given by:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nAnd the volume \\( V \\) is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the surface area is 314 square centimeters, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 4\\pi r^2 = 314 \\]\n\nI need to solve for \\( r \\). Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by \\( 4\\pi \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{314}{4\\pi} \\]\n\nI know that \\( \\pi \\) is approximately 3.14, so:\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{314}{4 \\times 3.14} \\]\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{314}{12.56} \\]\n\n\\[ r^2 = 25 \\]\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{25} \\]\n\n\\[ r = 5 \\] centimeters\n\nSo, the radius is 5 cm.\n\nNext, I'll find the volume using the radius I just found.\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 3.14 \\times (5)^3 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 5^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 5^3 = 125 \\]\n\nNow, plug that back in:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 3.14 \\times 125 \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4 \\times 3.14 \\times 125}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1570}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 523.33 \\] cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the radius is 5 cm and the volume is approximately 523.33 cubic centimeters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the surface area:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 = 314 \\]\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{314}{4\\pi} \\]\n\nUsing \\( \\pi = 3.14 \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{314}{4 \\times 3.14} = \\frac{314}{12.56} = 25 \\]\n\n\\[ r = 5 \\] cm\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, volume:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 3.14 \\times 125 \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4 \\times 3.14 \\times 125}{3} = \\frac{1570}{3} \\approx 523.33 \\] cm\u00b3\n\nYes, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the exact value of \\( \\pi \\) for more precision, but since the problem gave the surface area as 314 cm\u00b2, which is approximately \\( 4 \\times 3.14 \\times 5^2 \\), it seems like using \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14 \\) is appropriate here.\n\nSo, final answer: radius = 5 cm, volume \u2248 523.33 cm\u00b3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{r = 5 \\text{ cm}, \\ V \\approx 523.33 \\text{ cm}^3} \\]"
