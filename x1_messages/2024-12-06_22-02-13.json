        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem about buying apples and oranges, and I need to figure out how many apples someone bought based on the total number of fruits and the total cost. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that apples cost $1 each and oranges cost $2 each. The customer bought 5 fruits in total and spent exactly $8. I need to find out how many apples that is.\n\nMaybe I can set up some equations here. Let's say:\n\n- Let A be the number of apples.\n\n- Let O be the number of oranges.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that:\n\n1. A + O = 5 (because total fruits are 5)\n\n2. 1*A + 2*O = 8 (because apples cost $1 each and oranges cost $2 each, and total cost is $8)\n\nSo, I have two equations:\n\nEquation 1: A + O = 5\n\nEquation 2: A + 2O = 8\n\nHmm, now I need to solve these equations to find the value of A (number of apples).\n\nI can use the first equation to express one variable in terms of the other. For example, from Equation 1, A = 5 - O.\n\nNow, plug this into Equation 2:\n\n(5 - O) + 2O = 8\n\nSimplify that:\n\n5 - O + 2O = 8\n\n5 + O = 8\n\nNow, subtract 5 from both sides:\n\nO = 3\n\nSo, the number of oranges is 3.\n\nNow, plug back into Equation 1:\n\nA + 3 = 5\n\nTherefore, A = 2\n\nSo, the customer bought 2 apples.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf A = 2, O = 3\n\nTotal cost: 2*(1) + 3*(2) = 2 + 6 = 8, which matches the total cost.\n\nTotal fruits: 2 + 3 = 5, which also matches.\n\nLooks good.\n\nAlternatively, I could have tried different combinations.\n\nFor example, if A = 0, O = 5, total cost would be 0*1 + 5*2 = 10, which is more than 8.\n\nIf A = 1, O = 4, total cost: 1*1 + 4*2 = 1 + 8 = 9, still more than 8.\n\nA = 2, O = 3, total cost: 2 + 6 = 8, which matches.\n\nA = 3, O = 2, total cost: 3 + 4 = 7, which is less than 8.\n\nA = 4, O = 1, total cost: 4 + 2 = 6, still less than 8.\n\nA = 5, O = 0, total cost: 5 + 0 = 5, way less than 8.\n\nSo, only A = 2, O = 3 satisfies both conditions.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about it in terms of the difference in cost.\n\nEach orange costs $1 more than an apple.\n\nTotal extra cost is $8 - $5 (if all were apples) = $3.\n\nSo, number of oranges is $3 / $1 = 3.\n\nTherefore, A = 5 - 3 = 2.\n\nSame answer.\n\nYeah, it seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is 2 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
