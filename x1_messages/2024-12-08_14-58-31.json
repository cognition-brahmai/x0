        "content": "Let's see. There are 40 students in the class. 60% have brown eyes, 30% have blue eyes, and the rest have green eyes. I need to find out how many students have each eye color.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of students with brown eyes. Since 60% of the class has brown eyes, I can find that by taking 60% of 40.\n\nSo, 60% of 40 is calculated as:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 40 = 24\n\nSo, 24 students have brown eyes.\n\nNext, for blue eyes, 30% of the class has blue eyes. So, I'll calculate 30% of 40.\n\n0.30 \u00d7 40 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 students have blue eyes.\n\nNow, to find the number of students with green eyes, I can subtract the number of students with brown and blue eyes from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students = 40\n\nStudents with brown eyes = 24\n\nStudents with blue eyes = 12\n\nSo, students with green eyes = 40 - 24 - 12 = 4\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the percentage of students with green eyes. Since 60% have brown eyes and 30% have blue eyes, that adds up to 90%. Therefore, the remaining 10% have green eyes.\n\nTo verify, 10% of 40 is:\n\n0.10 \u00d7 40 = 4\n\nWhich matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- 24 students have brown eyes\n\n- 12 students have blue eyes\n\n- 4 students have green eyes\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24 \\text{ brown}, 12 \\text{ blue}, 4 \\text{ green}} \\]"
