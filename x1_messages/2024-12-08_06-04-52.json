        "content": "So there are 5 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that handshake is a mutual activity between two people, so it's about pairs of people. So, maybe I can think about how many unique pairs can be formed from 5 people.\n\nLet me list them out to make sure I don't miss any. Let's call the people A, B, C, D, and E, where A is Alice and B is Bob.\n\nSo, A shakes hands with B, C, D, and E. That's 4 handshakes.\n\nThen, B already shook hands with A, so B shakes hands with C, D, and E. That's 3 more handshakes.\n\nNext, C has already shaken hands with A and B, so C shakes hands with D and E. That's 2 more handshakes.\n\nThen, D has already shaken hands with A, B, and C, so D shakes hands with E. That's 1 more handshake.\n\nFinally, E has already shaken hands with everyone else, so no new handshakes here.\n\nNow, let's add them up: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 handshakes in total.\n\nIs there a better way to calculate this without listing everyone out? I think there is. I recall that in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose 2 items from n items is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, n is 5 (since there are 5 people), so C(5, 2) = 5*4/2 = 10. That matches what I got earlier by listing them out.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is 10.\n\nWait a minute, the question mentions Alice and Bob specifically, but in my calculation, they don't seem to play a special role. Does their identity matter here?\n\nWell, the question just includes them as part of the 5 people and doesn't specify any special conditions related to them. So, I think their names are just to identify two participants among the five.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using graphs. I've heard of representing handshakes as edges in a graph where people are nodes.\n\nSo, with 5 nodes, and each node connected to every other node, it's a complete graph with 5 vertices, denoted as K5. The number of edges in K5 is C(5, 2) = 10, which again confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlright, I think I've approached this problem from different angles and consistently get the same answer: 10 handshakes.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of double-counting or missing something. In the listing method, I made sure that each handshake is only counted once by having each person shake hands with only those who haven't shaken hands with them yet. In the combination formula, it inherently avoids double-counting by defining unique pairs.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 10 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
