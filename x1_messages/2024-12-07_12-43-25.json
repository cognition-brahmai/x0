        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a film production company planning to shoot a movie in three different countries with a total budget of $30 million. The budget is broken down into four main categories: salaries, equipment and set construction, location permits and logistics, and marketing and distribution. The percentages allocated to each are 40% for salaries, 30% for equipment and set construction, 20% for location permits and logistics, and 10% for marketing and distribution. My task is to calculate the amount allocated for each category and provide a step-by-step reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the total budget is and how it's being divided. The total budget is $30 million, and it's divided into four parts based on the given percentages. So, I need to find out how much money is assigned to each of these parts.\n\nLet's start with salaries. It's allocated 40% of the total budget. To find out how much that is in dollars, I need to calculate 40% of $30 million.\n\nI know that percentages can be converted to decimals for easier calculation. So, 40% is equal to 0.40.\n\nNow, I multiply the total budget by this decimal:\n\n$30,000,000 * 0.40 = $12,000,000\n\nSo, $12 million is allocated for salaries.\n\nNext, equipment and set construction make up 30% of the budget.\n\nAgain, converting 30% to a decimal gives me 0.30.\n\nMultiplying the total budget by this decimal:\n\n$30,000,000 * 0.30 = $9,000,000\n\nTherefore, $9 million is allocated for equipment and set construction.\n\nNow, location permits and logistics are allocated 20% of the budget.\n\nConverting 20% to a decimal is 0.20.\n\nMultiplying the total budget by 0.20:\n\n$30,000,000 * 0.20 = $6,000,000\n\nSo, $6 million is allocated for location permits and logistics.\n\nLastly, marketing and distribution get 10% of the budget.\n\nConverting 10% to a decimal is 0.10.\n\nMultiplying the total budget by 0.10:\n\n$30,000,000 * 0.10 = $3,000,000\n\nTherefore, $3 million is allocated for marketing and distribution.\n\nTo double-check my calculations, I can add up all these amounts and see if they total the original $30 million.\n\n$12,000,000 (salaries) + $9,000,000 (equipment and set construction) + $6,000,000 (location permits and logistics) + $3,000,000 (marketing and distribution) = $30,000,000\n\nYes, it adds up correctly.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Salaries: $12,000,000\n\n- Equipment and set construction: $9,000,000\n\n- Location permits and logistics: $6,000,000\n\n- Marketing and distribution: $3,000,000\n\nI think that's the complete breakdown of the budget according to the given percentages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{Salaries:} & \\$12,000,000 \\\\\n\\text{Equipment and set construction:} & \\$9,000,000 \\\\\n\\text{Location permits and logistics:} & \\$6,000,000 \\\\\n\\text{Marketing and distribution:} & \\$3,000,000 \\\\\n\\end{array}} \\]"
