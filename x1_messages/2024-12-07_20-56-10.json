        "content": "Sure! An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\nTo check if two strings are anagrams, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Remove any non-alphanumeric characters** and convert both strings to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive and not affected by special characters.\n\n2. **Sort the characters** in both strings and compare the sorted versions. If they are identical, the strings are anagrams.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a frequency count approach where we count the occurrences of each character in both strings and compare these counts.\n\nI'll provide you with both methods.\n\n### Method 1: Sorting\n\nIn this method, we sort both strings and compare them directly.\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, str1)).lower()\n    str2 = ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, str2)).lower()\n    \n    # Sort the characters and compare\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Frequency Count\n\nIn this method, we use dictionaries to count the occurrences of each character in both strings and then compare these dictionaries.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase\n    str1 = ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, str1)).lower()\n    str2 = ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, str2)).lower()\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    return Counter(str1) == Counter(str2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Step 1:** We clean the strings by removing any non-alphanumeric characters and converting them to lowercase. This ensures that the comparison is fair and not influenced by case or special characters.\n\n- **Step 2:** In the sorting method, we sort the characters of both cleaned strings and check if the sorted versions are identical. In the frequency count method, we use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in both cleaned strings and then compare these counters.\n\nBoth methods are effective, but the frequency count method might be slightly more efficient for longer strings because sorting can be more computationally expensive than counting. However, for most practical purposes, the difference in performance is negligible.\n\nYou can choose either method based on your preference or specific requirements."
