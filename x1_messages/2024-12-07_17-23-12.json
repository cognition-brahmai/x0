        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bee that buys 12 roses in a flower shop, and each rose costs $2 more than the previous one. The first rose costs $1. We need to find out how much the bee spent in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pricing pattern of the roses. The first rose costs $1, and each subsequent rose costs $2 more than the one before it. So, the second rose would cost $1 + $2 = $3, the third would cost $3 + $2 = $5, and so on.\n\nThis seems like an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. In this case, the common difference is $2.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \\times d \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( a_n \\) is the nth term\n\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term\n\n- \\( n \\) is the term number\n\n- \\( d \\) is the common difference\n\nGiven that:\n\n- \\( a_1 = $1 \\)\n\n- \\( d = $2 \\)\n\n- \\( n = 12 \\) (since there are 12 roses)\n\nWe can find the cost of the 12th rose using this formula:\n\n\\[ a_{12} = 1 + (12 - 1) \\times 2 = 1 + 11 \\times 2 = 1 + 22 = $23 \\]\n\nSo, the 12th rose costs $23.\n\nNow, to find the total amount spent by the bee, we need to sum up the costs of all 12 roses. The sum \\( s_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\n\\[ s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n\\[ s_{12} = \\frac{12}{2} \\times (1 + 23) = 6 \\times 24 = $144 \\]\n\nTherefore, the bee spent a total of $144.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm using the correct formula. I recall that there's another formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n\\[ s_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d) \\]\n\nLet me use this formula to verify my result.\n\n\\[ s_{12} = \\frac{12}{2} \\times (2 \\times 1 + (12 - 1) \\times 2) = 6 \\times (2 + 11 \\times 2) = 6 \\times (2 + 22) = 6 \\times 24 = $144 \\]\n\nGreat, both formulas give me the same result, so I'm confident that $144 is the correct total amount spent by the bee.\n\nAlternatively, I could list out the cost of each rose and add them up manually to verify:\n\n1st rose: $1\n\n2nd rose: $1 + $2 = $3\n\n3rd rose: $3 + $2 = $5\n\n4th rose: $5 + $2 = $7\n\n5th rose: $7 + $2 = $9\n\n6th rose: $9 + $2 = $11\n\n7th rose: $11 + $2 = $13\n\n8th rose: $13 + $2 = $15\n\n9th rose: $15 + $2 = $17\n\n10th rose: $17 + $2 = $19\n\n11th rose: $19 + $2 = $21\n\n12th rose: $21 + $2 = $23\n\nNow, adding these up: 1 + 3 = 4, 4 + 5 = 9, 9 + 7 = 16, 16 + 9 = 25, 25 + 11 = 36, 36 + 13 = 49, 49 + 15 = 64, 64 + 17 = 81, 81 + 19 = 100, 100 + 21 = 121, 121 + 23 = 144.\n\nAgain, the total is $144, which matches my previous calculations.\n\nI think I've covered this problem thoroughly and can confidently say that the bee spent $144 in total at the flower shop.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]"
