So, to find out how much each person has to pay, I think I need to divide the total bill by the number of friends.\n\nSo, that would be $240 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do the math: 240 divided by 8.\n\n8 times 30 is 240, so each person should pay $30.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If each of the 8 friends pays $30, then 8 times 30 is indeed 240. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there are taxes or tips added to the bill, but the problem doesn't mention that. So, I'll assume the total bill of $240 is inclusive of everything, and they just need to split that amount evenly.\n\nSo, yes, each person pays $30.\n\nI think that's straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there was any other factor involved. For example, if some friends ordered more than others, but again, the problem says they decide to split the bill evenly, regardless of what they ordered.\n\nSo, the answer should be $30 per person.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
