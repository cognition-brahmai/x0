Ellen is sitting at her desk, smiling warmly. The audience is buzzing with excitement. Tom Hanks walks onto the stage to enthusiastic applause. He shakes Ellen's hand and takes a seat across from her.]\n\nEllen: Tom Hanks, welcome back to the show! It's so great to have you here.\n\nTom: Thank you, Ellen. It's always a pleasure to be here.\n\nEllen: Now, Tom, you've had an incredible career spanning decades. From Forrest Gump to Toy Story, you've amazed us time and time again. But today, I hear you have something new up your sleeve. Can you tell us about your latest project?\n\nTom: Absolutely, Ellen. I'm excited to share that I have a new film coming out called \"Echoes of Time.\" It's a drama that explores the lives of people who have experienced time travel. It's a bit of a departure from some of my previous roles, but I think audiences are really going to connect with it.\n\nEllen: Time travel? That sounds fascinating! Can you give us a sneak peek into your character?\n\nTom: Well, without giving too much away, my character, Jack, is a historian who accidentally stumbles upon a time-travel device. As he journeys through different eras, he begins to question his own existence and the impact of his actions on history.\n\nEllen: Wow, that sounds like a deep and thought-provoking role. I can't wait to see it. Now, Tom, you're not just an actor; you're also a director and producer. How do you balance all these different roles?\n\nTom: It's definitely a juggling act, Ellen. Each role requires a different set of skills and responsibilities. As an actor, I focus on bringing characters to life, while directing allows me to shape the overall vision of a project. Producing involves overseeing the entire production process, from development to distribution. It's challenging, but I love the creativity and collaboration that come with each role.\n\nEllen: And you do it all so seamlessly. Now, switching gears a bit, you're known for your incredible versatility as an actor. From comedic roles to dramatic ones, you seem to excel in everything you do. What drives you to take on such diverse projects?\n\nTom: I think it's important to challenge yourself and step out of your comfort zone. Each role offers a new opportunity to learn and grow as an actor. Whether it's comedy or drama, I approach every character with the same level of dedication and passion. I believe that variety keeps my work fresh and interesting, both for me and for the audience.\n\nEllen: That's a wonderful attitude to have. Now, speaking of comedy, you've had some hilarious moments in films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"Cast Away.\" Do you have a favorite comedic scene that you've done?\n\nTom: Oh, that's a tough one. There are so many funny moments across different films. But if I had to pick one, I'd probably go with the scene in \"Sleepless in Seattle\" where I'm trying to fix the sink and end up making a mess. It's simple, yet it captures the essence of haplessness in a way that audiences can relate to.\n\nEllen: That's a classic! And who could forget your portrayal of Woody in the Toy Story franchise? You've been voicing him for over two decades now. What has that experience been like for you?\n\nTom: It's been an absolute dream come true, Ellen. Playing Woody has been one of the greatest honors of my career. The Toy Story films have become a part of popular culture, and being a part of that legacy is something I'm incredibly proud of. Plus, working with such talented voice actors and the amazing team at Pixar has been a joy.\n\nEllen: Indeed, Pixar is a powerhouse. Now, Tom, you're also very involved in philanthropy and supporting various causes. Can you tell us about any initiatives you're particularly passionate about?\n\nTom: Absolutely. One cause that's close to my heart is education. I believe that access to quality education is essential for personal growth and societal progress. Through my foundation, I've been working on projects that aim to improve educational opportunities, especially for underprivileged communities. It's a cause that I'm deeply committed to.\n\nEllen: That's amazing. It's wonderful to see celebrities using their platform for good. Now, before we wrap up, I have to ask\u2014what's next for Tom Hanks? Any projects in the pipeline that you can share with us?\n\nTom: Well, after \"Echoes of Time,\" I'm working on a biographical film about a renowned scientist. It's a challenging role, but I'm excited to dive into the research and bring this fascinating\u4eba\u7269 to life on screen. Plus, I have a few more Toy Story films in the works, so I'll continue voicing Woody for those as well.\n\nEllen: Oh, that sounds fantastic. We can't wait to see what you have in store for us. Tom Hanks, thank you so much for being here today. It's always a pleasure to have you on the show.\n\nTom: Thank you, Ellen. It's been great chatting with you.\n\n[The audience applauds as the interview comes to an end. Tom Hanks stands up, shakes Ellen's hand again, and waves to the audience as he exits the stage.]\n\n[End of Script]"
