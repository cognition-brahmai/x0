        "content": "The famous speech you're referring to is the Gettysburg Address, delivered by Abraham Lincoln on November 19, 1863, during the American Civil War. The full first sentence is: \"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\"\n\nThis speech is considered one of the most important in American history, as it redefined the purpose of the war, shifting the focus from simply preserving the Union to also abolishing slavery and ensuring equality for all citizens. The Gettysburg Address was delivered at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, following the Union victory in the Battle of Gettysburg, which was a turning point in the war.\n\nLincoln's speech, though short\u2014lasting only about two to three minutes and consisting of just 272 words\u2014has had a profound and lasting impact on American ideals and identity. It reinforced the principles of human equality and democracy, which are central to the American ethos."
