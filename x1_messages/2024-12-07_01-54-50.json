        "content": "So the company is spending $12,000 on advertising each month and getting an average of 600 new customers from that. They're thinking about increasing their advertising budget by 50%. I need to figure out how many more new customers they can expect to get each month if they do that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 50% increase in the advertising budget means. If they're spending $12,000 now, and they increase that by 50%, I can calculate the new budget by multiplying $12,000 by 1.5. So, $12,000 times 1.5 is $18,000. So, their new advertising budget would be $18,000 per month.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many new customers they can expect with this new budget. I know that with $12,000, they get 600 new customers. So, with $18,000, which is 50% more, I need to find out what 50% more customers would be.\n\nWait, but is it directly proportional? Maybe. Assuming that the relationship between advertising spend and new customers is linear, meaning that if you spend more, you get more customers in a directly proportional way.\n\nSo, if $12,000 gets 600 customers, then each dollar gets 600 divided by 12,000 customers. Let's calculate that. 600 divided by 12,000 is 0.05 customers per dollar.\n\nWait, that seems too low. Maybe I should think of it differently. Perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, if they increase their spending by 50%, and everything else remains the same, they might expect a 50% increase in customers.\n\nSo, 50% of 600 is 300. So, they could expect an additional 300 customers.\n\nBut wait, is that the right way to look at it? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of cost per customer. Currently, they're spending $12,000 to get 600 customers. So, the cost per customer is $12,000 divided by 600, which is $20 per customer.\n\nIf they increase their budget to $18,000, and the cost per customer remains the same at $20, then the number of new customers would be $18,000 divided by $20 per customer, which is 900 customers.\n\nSo, currently, they're getting 600 customers, and with the increased budget, they could get 900 customers. Therefore, the additional customers would be 900 minus 600, which is 300.\n\nSo, they can expect 300 more new customers each month if they increase their advertising budget by 50%.\n\nBut wait, is this assumption valid? Is the relationship between advertising spend and new customers really linear? In reality, it might not be. There could be diminishing returns, meaning that each additional dollar spent on advertising might bring in fewer new customers than the previous dollar.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify any non-linear relationships or mention diminishing returns, I think it's acceptable to assume a linear relationship for this calculation.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether all of the additional spend would translate directly into more customers. But again, without additional information, assuming a direct proportion seems reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that they can expect 300 more new customers each month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
