        "content": "Let's see. So, in this family, there are 2 parents and 4 children. Each child has exactly 3 siblings. The question is asking for the total number of siblings that all the children have combined.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what is meant by \"siblings.\" In a family, siblings are brothers and sisters. So, for each child, their siblings are the other children in the family, excluding themselves.\n\nGiven that each child has exactly 3 siblings, that makes sense because there are 4 children in total. If you take one child, the number of siblings they have would be the total number of children minus one (themselves). So, 4 - 1 = 3 siblings per child.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of siblings that all the children have combined. So, if each child has 3 siblings, and there are 4 children, then it might seem like the total is 4 times 3, which is 12.\n\nBut wait a minute, that doesn't seem right. If there are only 4 children in total, how can the combined number of siblings be 12? That would mean each sibling is being counted multiple times.\n\nI think the key here is to understand that when we say each child has 3 siblings, those siblings are shared among the children. So, the total number of unique siblings that all the children have combined should just be the total number of children minus one, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe I should consider the relationships between the children.\n\nLet's label the children as A, B, C, and D.\n\n- A's siblings are B, C, D.\n\n- B's siblings are A, C, D.\n\n- C's siblings are A, B, D.\n\n- D's siblings are A, B, C.\n\nSo, each child has three siblings, as stated.\n\nNow, if we combine all the siblings that each child has:\n\n- A has B, C, D.\n\n- B has A, C, D.\n\n- C has A, B, D.\n\n- D has A, B, C.\n\nIf we list them all out, we have:\n\nB, C, D, A, C, D, A, B, D, A, B, C.\n\nThat's a total of 12 sibling relationships.\n\nBut, of course, many of these are duplicates. For example, A is counted as a sibling by B, C, and D, so A is listed three times.\n\nSimilarly, B is listed three times, C is listed three times, and D is listed three times.\n\nBut the question is asking for the total number of siblings that all the children have combined. So, if we add up all the siblings each child has, it's 4 children times 3 siblings each, which is 12.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting the total number of unique siblings that all children have combined.\n\nIn that case, since all the children share the same set of siblings (just excluding themselves), the unique siblings would be the other 3 children for each.\n\nBut again, combining them would still be the same group of 3 for each child.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet's consider that each sibling relationship is shared between two children. So, for example, the relationship between A and B is counted twice: once as A being B's sibling, and once as B being A's sibling.\n\nSo, in total, there are 4 children, each having 3 siblings, which would suggest 12 sibling relationships, but since each relationship is counted twice, the actual number of unique sibling relationships is 12 divided by 2, which is 6.\n\nBut I don't think that's directly answering the question.\n\nThe question is asking for the total number of siblings that all the children have combined.\n\nSo, if each of the 4 children has 3 siblings, then the total number of siblings when combined is 12.\n\nBut, this counts each sibling multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of unique siblings that all the children have when combined.\n\nIn that case, since all the children are siblings to each other, the total number of unique siblings would be 3 per child, but combined, it's still 3, because they all share the same siblings.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, in a group of 4 children, each has 3 siblings. If we combine all their siblings, it's still those 3 siblings being shared among them.\n\nSo, in total, the combined siblings would be the entire group of children minus themselves.\n\nBut, the question is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLet me try to rephrase it.\n\nIf I have 4 children: A, B, C, D.\n\nEach has 3 siblings:\n\n- A: B, C, D\n\n- B: A, C, D\n\n- C: A, B, D\n\n- D: A, B, C\n\nNow, if I combine all their siblings, I get B, C, D, A, C, D, A, B, D, A, B, C.\n\nThat's a list of 12 siblings.\n\nBut, of course, there are only 4 unique children serving as siblings.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of sibling relationships.\n\nIn that case, since each pair of children is siblings, and there are 4 children, the number of unique pairs is C(4,2) = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 unique sibling relationships.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total number of siblings that all the children claim when you ask each one how many siblings they have and add them up.\n\nIn that case, it would be 4 children times 3 siblings each, which is 12.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, that counts each sibling multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of siblings that all the children have, considering that they share the same siblings.\n\nIn that case, since there are 4 children, and each has 3 siblings, but those siblings are shared, the total number of unique siblings is 3 per child, but combined, it's still 3, because they all share the same siblings.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, in a group of 4 children, each has 3 siblings, but when you combine all their siblings, you're essentially listing all the other children multiple times.\n\nBut, in reality, the total number of unique siblings is 3 per child, but since they are shared, the combined total is still 3.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me think about it this way:\n\nIf there are 4 children, and each has 3 siblings, then the total number of sibling relationships is 12, but this counts each relationship twice (once for each side), so the actual number of unique sibling relationships is 6.\n\nBut the question is asking for the total number of siblings that all the children have combined.\n\nSo, perhaps it's asking for the sum of the number of siblings each child has.\n\nIn that case, it would be 4 children times 3 siblings each, which is 12.\n\nBut, this seems too straightforward, and I'm wondering if there's some trick or deeper meaning in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total number of siblings that all the children have, excluding themselves, but combined.\n\nWait, that seems similar to the previous interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the total number of sibling relationships in the family.\n\nIn that case, since there are 4 children, the number of unique pairs of siblings is C(4,2) = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 unique sibling relationships.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nMaybe I should look at the way the question is phrased.\n\n\"In a family, there are 2 parents and 4 children. Each child has exactly 3 siblings. How many total siblings do all the children have combined?\"\n\nSo, the key phrase is \"total siblings do all the children have combined.\"\n\nOne way to interpret this is to consider that each child has 3 siblings, and there are 4 children, so the total number of siblings when combined is 12.\n\nBut, this counts each sibling multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of unique siblings that all the children have when combined.\n\nIn that case, since all the children share the same siblings, the total number of unique siblings is 3 per child, but combined, it's still 3, because they all share the same siblings.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, in a group of 4 children, each has 3 siblings, but when you combine all their siblings, you're listing all the other children multiple times.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- A's siblings: B, C, D\n\n- B's siblings: A, C, D\n\n- C's siblings: A, B, D\n\n- D's siblings: A, B, C\n\nWhen you combine these, you get a list of B, C, D, A, C, D, A, B, D, A, B, C.\n\nThat's a list of 12 siblings, but consisting of only 4 unique children.\n\nSo, the total number of siblings when combined is 12.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking for the total number of unique siblings that all the children have combined, then it would be 3, since each child has 3 siblings, and all children share the same set of siblings.\n\nBut, that seems contradictory because the combined unique siblings would still be the other 3 children for each, but combined across all children, it's still 3 unique siblings per child.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, when you combine all the siblings that each child has, you're including all the other children multiple times.\n\nBut, in reality, the total number of unique siblings is 3 per child, but since they share the same siblings, the combined unique siblings would be the set of all other children, which is 3 per child.\n\nBut, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think of it in terms of sets.\n\nLet S be the set of all children: S = {A, B, C, D}\n\nFor each child, their siblings are S minus themselves.\n\nSo, for A: siblings are {B, C, D}\n\nFor B: siblings are {A, C, D}\n\nFor C: siblings are {A, B, D}\n\nFor D: siblings are {A, B, C}\n\nNow, the combined set of all siblings is the union of these sets:\n\n{B, C, D} union {A, C, D} union {A, B, D} union {A, B, C} = {A, B, C, D}\n\nSo, the combined unique siblings are all the children except themselves, which is still {A, B, C, D} minus themselves.\n\nWait, but {A, B, C, D} minus themselves is {B, C, D}, {A, C, D}, {A, B, D}, {A, B, C}.\n\nThe union of these is {A, B, C, D}.\n\nBut, the question is asking for the total number of siblings, not the unique siblings.\n\nSo, perhaps it's asking for the sum of the number of siblings each child has.\n\nIn that case, it would be 4 children times 3 siblings each, which is 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the total number of unique sibling relationships.\n\nIn that case, it would be the number of unique pairs of siblings, which is C(4,2) = 6.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is that the total number of siblings that all the children have combined is 12.\n\nBut, I'm still a bit unsure because of the potential for double-counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of siblings that all the children have, considering that each child's siblings are shared with the others.\n\nIn that case, the total number of unique siblings is 3 per child, but combined, it's still 3, because they all share the same siblings.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, in a group of 4 children, each has 3 siblings, but when you combine all their siblings, you're counting each sibling multiple times.\n\nSo, for example, A's siblings are B, C, D.\n\nB's siblings are A, C, D.\n\nC's siblings are A, B, D.\n\nD's siblings are A, B, C.\n\nSo, when you combine them, you have:\n\nB, C, D (from A)\n\nA, C, D (from B)\n\nA, B, D (from C)\n\nA, B, C (from D)\n\nTotal: A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D.\n\nThat's 12 siblings, with each sibling being counted 3 times.\n\nSo, the total number of siblings when combined is 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of sibling relationships in the family.\n\nIn that case, each pair of children is a sibling relationship, and there are C(4,2) = 6 unique pairs.\n\nSo, there are 6 unique sibling relationships.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nGiven that the question specifies \"all the children have combined,\" and it says \"total siblings,\" it seems like it's asking for the sum of the number of siblings each child has.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be 4 children times 3 siblings each, which is 12.\n\nBut, to make sure, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose there are n children, and each has s siblings.\n\nThen, the total number of siblings when combined is n * s.\n\nIn this case, n = 4, s = 3, so total is 12.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that each sibling relationship is between two children, then the total number of unique sibling relationships is C(n,2) = C(4,2) = 6.\n\nBut, the question is asking for the total number of siblings, not the number of unique relationships.\n\nSo, perhaps the first approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of siblings that all the children have combined is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
