        "content": "The most common way to contract a skin infection is through direct contact with an infected person or contaminated surfaces. Bacteria, fungi, and viruses can all cause skin infections, and they can be spread through skin-to-skin contact, sharing personal items like towels or razors, or by touching contaminated objects. It's important to practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly and keeping cuts and scrapes clean and covered, to reduce the risk of skin infections."
