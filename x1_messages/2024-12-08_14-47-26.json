        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help with that physics problem. So, we have a ball being dropped from a height of 50 meters, and we need to find out how long it takes to reach the ground, assuming there's no air resistance. The formula given is t = \u221a(2h/g), where h is the height and g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.81 meters per second squared.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what's going on here. When you drop a ball from a certain height, it falls towards the ground under the influence of gravity. In the absence of air resistance, the only force acting on the ball is gravity, which causes it to accelerate downwards at a constant rate of 9.81 m/s\u00b2. This is a standard assumption in introductory physics problems to simplify the calculations.\n\nThe formula t = \u221a(2h/g) is derived from the equations of motion for an object undergoing constant acceleration. Specifically, it comes from the equation that relates the distance traveled (in this case, the height h) to the time t, initial velocity, and acceleration. Since the ball is dropped, its initial velocity is zero. So, the equation simplifies to h = (1/2) * g * t\u00b2. Solving this equation for t gives us t = \u221a(2h/g).\n\nNow, let's plug in the values we have. The height h is 50 meters, and g is 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, t = \u221a(2 * 50 / 9.81)\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator inside the square root: 2 * 50 = 100.\n\nThen, divide that by g: 100 / 9.81 \u2248 10.19367991844995.\n\nFinally, take the square root of that result: \u221a10.19367991844995 \u2248 3.193.\n\nSo, the time it takes for the ball to reach the ground is approximately 3.19 seconds.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check those calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nt = \u221a(2h/g)\n\nh = 50 m\n\ng = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\nFirst, 2h = 2 * 50 = 100 m\n\nThen, 100 / 9.81 \u2248 10.19367991844995 s\u00b2\n\nNow, \u221a10.19367991844995 \u2248 3.193 s\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a different approach to verify this result. Let's recall that for an object falling from rest with constant acceleration g, the distance traveled is given by h = (1/2) * g * t\u00b2.\n\nSo, rearranging for t: t = \u221a(2h/g)\n\nThis matches the formula we're using, so I'm confident it's the right approach.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the equations of motion. Starting from rest, the velocity v at time t is v = g*t, and the position y at time t is y = (1/2)*g*t\u00b2.\n\nIn this problem, the ball starts at y = 50 m and falls to y = 0 m. So, we set y = 0 and solve for t:\n\n0 = 50 - (1/2)*g*t\u00b2\n\nRearranging: (1/2)*g*t\u00b2 = 50\n\nThen: t\u00b2 = 100 / g\n\nSo: t = \u221a(100 / g) = \u221a(100 / 9.81) \u2248 \u221a10.19367991844995 \u2248 3.193 s\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the acceleration due to gravity, g, is approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2 near the Earth's surface. This value can vary slightly depending on location, but for most physics problems, 9.81 m/s\u00b2 is acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, in real-world scenarios, air resistance would affect the fall time, and the formula would need to be adjusted accordingly. However, since the problem specifies to assume no air resistance, we can ignore that factor.\n\nSo, to summarize, the time it takes for the ball to reach the ground is approximately 3.19 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.19 \\text{ s}} \\]"
