        "content": "Let's see. There are 120 employees in total, and out of them, 20 are managers. So, the number of regular employees would be 120 minus 20, which is 100.\n\nNow, the total budget for bonuses is $72,000. Managers receive twice as much as regular employees. So, if a regular employee gets x dollars, then a manager gets 2x dollars.\n\nSo, the total bonus can be expressed as:\n\n(Total for regular employees) + (Total for managers) = $72,000\n\nWhich is:\n\n(100 * x) + (20 * 2x) = 72,000\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n100x + 40x = 72,000\n\n140x = 72,000\n\nNow, to find x, I'll divide both sides by 140:\n\nx = 72,000 / 140\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n72,000 divided by 140.\n\nFirst, 140 times 500 is 70,000.\n\nSubtract 70,000 from 72,000, which leaves 2,000.\n\n140 times 14 is 1,960.\n\nSubtract that from 2,000, which leaves 40.\n\n140 times 0.2 is 28.\n\nSo, 140 times 14.2 is 19,600 + 280 = 19,880. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nMaybe I should use a calculator for this.\n\n72,000 \u00f7 140 = ?\n\nLet me see: 140 \u00d7 514.2857... So, approximately $514.29.\n\nSo, each regular employee would receive about $514.29.\n\nBut let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf regular employees get $514.29, then managers get twice that, which is $1,028.58.\n\nNow, 100 regular employees times $514.29 equals $51,429.\n\n20 managers times $1,028.58 equals $20,571.60.\n\nAdding those together: $51,429 + $20,571.60 = $72,000.60.\n\nHmm, that's a little over $72,000 due to rounding.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to use the exact value.\n\nLet me calculate x exactly.\n\nx = 72,000 / 140\n\nLet me divide 72,000 by 140.\n\n72,000 \u00f7 140.\n\n140 \u00d7 514 = 71,960.\n\nSubtract that from 72,000, which leaves 40.\n\nSo, 140 \u00d7 514 + 40 = 72,000.\n\nTherefore, x = 514 + 40/140 = 514 + 2/7 \u2248 514.2857...\n\nSo, approximately $514.29.\n\nSo, each regular employee will receive approximately $514.29.\n\nBut to be precise, it's $514.2857...\n\nMaybe it's better to use two decimal places, so $514.29.\n\nYes, that should be accurate enough.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{514.29} \\]"
