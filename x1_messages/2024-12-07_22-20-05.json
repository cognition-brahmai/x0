        "content": "Let's see. So, in this room, there are people with different eye colors: 60% have brown eyes, and 40% have green eyes. And it says that everyone with brown eyes wears glasses, and no one with green eyes wears glasses. I need to find out what percentage of people in the room wear glasses.\n\nOkay, first, I should understand the relationship between eye color and wearing glasses. So, all the people with brown eyes wear glasses, and none of the people with green eyes wear glasses. That means that only the people with brown eyes are wearing glasses.\n\nSo, if 60% of the people have brown eyes, and all of them wear glasses, then the percentage of people wearing glasses should be the same as the percentage of people with brown eyes, right?\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Let's assume there are 100 people in the room to make the percentages easier to work with.\n\nSo, out of 100 people:\n\n- 60 have brown eyes\n\n- 40 have green eyes\n\nNow, all 60 with brown eyes wear glasses, and none of the 40 with green eyes wear glasses. So, the total number of people wearing glasses is 60.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of people wearing glasses is 60%.\n\nBut wait, is there any other factor to consider here? The problem seems straightforward. It's clearly stating that only those with brown eyes wear glasses.\n\nLet me check if there's any trick here. Sometimes problems might have overlapping categories or other features, but in this case, it's pretty direct.\n\nSo, no one with green eyes wears glasses, and everyone with brown eyes does. Therefore, the percentage of people wearing glasses is equal to the percentage of people with brown eyes, which is 60%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
