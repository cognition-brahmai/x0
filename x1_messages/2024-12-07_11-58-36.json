        "content": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a group planning a trip that's 450 miles, and they're trying to decide between renting a van or taking a bus. The van costs $200 plus $0.20 per mile, and the bus costs $50 per person. We need to find out how many people must be in the group for the cost per person in the van to be less than the bus ticket.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the costs involved for both options.\n\nFor the van:\n\n- There's a fixed cost of $200.\n\n- Plus, $0.20 per mile, and the trip is 450 miles.\n\nWait, but 450 miles is one way, right? Or is it round trip? Hmm, the problem says \"travel 450 miles,\" but it doesn't specify if it's one way or round trip. I think I need to assume it's a round trip, so total miles would be 900 miles.\n\nLet me check: 450 miles, is this one way or round trip? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should ask for clarification. But perhaps I can proceed by assuming it's a round trip, meaning they need to travel 450 miles there and 450 miles back, totaling 900 miles.\n\nSo, for the van, the cost would be:\n\nTotal van cost = $200 + ($0.20 per mile * 900 miles)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$0.20 * 900 = $180\n\nSo, total van cost = $200 + $180 = $380\n\nNow, this is the total cost for the entire van, regardless of how many people are in it. So, to find the cost per person, I need to divide this total cost by the number of people, which I'll call \"n.\"\n\nSo, cost per person for the van = $380 / n\n\nFor the bus, the cost per person is a flat $50.\n\nWe need to find the number of people \"n\" where the van's cost per person is less than the bus's cost per person. So:\n\n$380 / n < $50\n\nNow, I need to solve for n.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply both sides by n to get rid of the denominator:\n\n$380 < $50 * n\n\nNow, divide both sides by $50:\n\n$380 / $50 < n\n\n$380 divided by $50 is 7.6\n\nSo, n > 7.6\n\nSince the number of people must be a whole number, we can say that n must be at least 8 people for the van's cost per person to be less than the bus's cost per person.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my assumptions. I assumed that the 450 miles is a round trip, meaning 900 miles total. But maybe it's a one-way trip, so only 450 miles total.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nIf it's a one-way trip, then:\n\nTotal van cost = $200 + ($0.20 * 450) = $200 + $90 = $290\n\nThen, cost per person = $290 / n\n\nSet up the inequality:\n\n$290 / n < $50\n\nMultiply both sides by n:\n\n$290 < $50n\n\nDivide by $50:\n\n$290 / $50 < n\n\n$290 divided by $50 is 5.8\n\nSo, n > 5.8\n\nRounding up, n must be at least 6 people.\n\nBut the problem says \"travel 450 miles,\" which could imply a one-way trip. However, in many contexts, especially for a group trip, it might be a round trip. Maybe I should consider both scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 450 miles is the total distance traveled, regardless of direction. Maybe it's not a round trip but a direct trip of 450 miles.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps I should ask for clarification on whether the 450 miles is one way or round trip. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should consider both cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 450 miles is the route they take, and it's not necessarily a round trip. In that case, it's probably best to assume it's a one-way trip of 450 miles.\n\nSo, let's proceed with the one-way assumption.\n\nTherefore, total van cost = $200 + ($0.20 * 450) = $200 + $90 = $290\n\nCost per person = $290 / n\n\nWe set this less than $50:\n\n$290 / n < $50\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn > $290 / $50\n\nn > 5.8\n\nSince n must be a whole number, n \u2265 6\n\nTherefore, the group must have at least 6 people for the van's cost per person to be less than the bus's cost per person.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check with n = 6 and n = 5.\n\nIf n = 6:\n\nVan cost per person = $290 / 6 \u2248 $48.33, which is less than $50.\n\nIf n = 5:\n\nVan cost per person = $290 / 5 = $58, which is more than $50.\n\nSo, indeed, with 6 people, the van is cheaper per person than the bus.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the group must have at least 6 people for the van to be the cheaper option per person.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
