        "content": "So, there are 4 classes in the school, and each class has 30 students. That means the total number of students in the school is 4 classes multiplied by 30 students per class, which is 120 students.\n\nNow, half of the students in each class are girls. So, in each class, the number of girls is half of 30, which is 15 girls per class.\n\nSince there are 4 classes, the total number of girls in the school is 4 classes multiplied by 15 girls per class, which equals 60 girls.\n\nSimilarly, since half of the students in each class are boys, each class has 15 boys.\n\nTherefore, the total number of boys in the school is 4 classes multiplied by 15 boys per class, which is also 60 boys.\n\nSo, there are 60 boys in the school.\n\nBut let me double-check that.\n\nTotal students: 4 classes \u00d7 30 students/class = 120 students.\n\nHalf are girls: 120 / 2 = 60 girls.\n\nTherefore, the remaining half should be boys: 120 - 60 = 60 boys.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, since each class has half girls and half boys, each class has 15 boys.\n\nSo, 4 classes \u00d7 15 boys/class = 60 boys.\n\nEither way, it's 60 boys in the school.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
