        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help with that calculation. So, we have a catering company preparing for an event with 500 guests, and they're offering three types of sandwiches: turkey, ham, and vegetarian. Based on past events, they estimate that 40% of guests will choose turkey, 35% will choose ham, and 25% will opt for vegetarian. They also want to prepare a buffer of 10% extra sandwiches to account for any unexpected demand or dietary restrictions. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of each type of sandwich based on the percentages given, and then add a 10% buffer to the total number of sandwiches.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of each type of sandwich without the buffer.\n\n- Turkey: 40% of 500 guests\n- Ham: 35% of 500 guests\n- Vegetarian: 25% of 500 guests\n\nLet's compute these:\n\nTurkey:\n40% of 500 = 0.40 * 500 = 200 sandwiches\n\nHam:\n35% of 500 = 0.35 * 500 = 175 sandwiches\n\nVegetarian:\n25% of 500 = 0.25 * 500 = 125 sandwiches\n\nSo, without the buffer, they would prepare 200 turkey, 175 ham, and 125 vegetarian sandwiches.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of sandwiches without the buffer.\n\nTotal sandwiches = Turkey + Ham + Vegetarian = 200 + 175 + 125 = 500 sandwiches\n\nStep 3: Calculate the buffer.\n\nThey want a 10% buffer on the total number of sandwiches.\n\nBuffer = 10% of 500 = 0.10 * 500 = 50 sandwiches\n\nStep 4: Determine how to allocate the buffer to each type of sandwich.\n\nSince the buffer is to account for unexpected demand or dietary restrictions, it's reasonable to distribute the buffer in proportion to the original percentages.\n\nSo, we'll add the buffer sandwiches in the same ratio as the original preferences.\n\nFirst, let's find the total parts based on the percentages:\n\n- Turkey: 40%\n- Ham: 35%\n- Vegetarian: 25%\n\nTotal percentage = 100%\n\nNow, calculate the number of buffer sandwiches for each type:\n\nTurkey buffer:\n40% of 50 = 0.40 * 50 = 20 sandwiches\n\nHam buffer:\n35% of 50 = 0.35 * 50 = 17.5 sandwiches\n\nVegetarian buffer:\n25% of 50 = 0.25 * 50 = 12.5 sandwiches\n\nSince we can't prepare half a sandwich, we need to decide how to handle the .5 sandwiches. One approach is to round up for one type and down for another, or adjust based on which types are more likely to be in higher demand.\n\nFor simplicity, let's round ham buffer down to 17 and vegetarian buffer up to 13, so the total buffer remains 50.\n\nSo, buffer:\n\n- Turkey: 20\n- Ham: 17\n- Vegetarian: 13\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total number of each type of sandwich including the buffer.\n\nTurkey total:\n200 (original) + 20 (buffer) = 220 sandwiches\n\nHam total:\n175 (original) + 17 (buffer) = 192 sandwiches\n\nVegetarian total:\n125 (original) + 13 (buffer) = 138 sandwiches\n\nJust to confirm, total sandwiches with buffer:\n\n220 + 192 + 138 = 550 sandwiches\n\nWhich matches the original total plus buffer: 500 + 50 = 550.\n\nSo, the catering company should prepare 220 turkey sandwiches, 192 ham sandwiches, and 138 vegetarian sandwiches.\n\nAlternatively, if they prefer to have whole numbers and adjust the buffer slightly, they could prepare:\n\n- Turkey: 220\n- Ham: 193\n- Vegetarian: 137\n\nThis would total 550 sandwiches, with the ham buffer adjusted to 18 (175 + 18 = 193) and vegetarian buffer to 12 (125 + 12 = 137), but in this case, the buffer distribution doesn't exactly match the percentages due to rounding.\n\nHowever, the initial approach with turkey: 220, ham: 192, vegetarian: 138 is acceptable and maintains the buffer as close as possible to the desired proportions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{220 \\text{ turkey sandwiches}, 192 \\text{ ham sandwiches}, 138 \\text{ vegetarian sandwiches}} \\]"
