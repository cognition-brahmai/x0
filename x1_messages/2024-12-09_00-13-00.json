        "content": "So I've got this function: f(x) = x^5 - 7x^3 + 6x, and I need to find all the critical points and figure out if they're local maxima, local minima, or saddle points. Okay, let's start by recalling what critical points are. They are the points where the derivative of the function is either zero or undefined. Since this is a polynomial, the derivative will be defined everywhere, so I just need to find where the derivative is zero.\n\nFirst, I'll find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^5 - 7x^3 + 6x) = 5x^4 - 21x^2 + 6\n\nNow, I need to set this equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n5x^4 - 21x^2 + 6 = 0\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which might be a bit tricky. But I notice that it only has even powers of x, so I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me set u = x^2, then the equation becomes:\n\n5u^2 - 21u + 6 = 0\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of u, which I can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nu = [21 \u00b1 sqrt( (-21)^2 - 4*5*6 )] / (2*5)\n\nu = [21 \u00b1 sqrt(441 - 120)] / 10\n\nu = [21 \u00b1 sqrt(321)] / 10\n\nSo, u = [21 + sqrt(321)] / 10 and u = [21 - sqrt(321)] / 10\n\nBut remember that u = x^2, so:\n\nx^2 = [21 + sqrt(321)] / 10\n\nx = \u00b1 sqrt([21 + sqrt(321)] / 10)\n\nAnd\n\nx^2 = [21 - sqrt(321)] / 10\n\nNow, sqrt(321) is approximately 17.916, so:\n\n[21 + 17.916]/10 = 38.916/10 = 3.8916\n\n[21 - 17.916]/10 = 3.084/10 = 0.3084\n\nSo, x = \u00b1 sqrt(3.8916) and x = \u00b1 sqrt(0.3084)\n\nCalculating the square roots:\n\nsqrt(3.8916) \u2248 1.9727\n\nsqrt(0.3084) \u2248 0.5553\n\nTherefore, the critical points are approximately:\n\nx \u2248 1.9727, -1.9727, 0.5553, -0.5553\n\nNow, to determine the nature of these critical points, I can use the second derivative test. I'll find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (5x^4 - 21x^2 + 6) = 20x^3 - 42x\n\nNow, I'll evaluate f''(x) at each critical point.\n\nFirst, x \u2248 1.9727:\n\nf''(1.9727) = 20*(1.9727)^3 - 42*(1.9727)\n\nCalculating (1.9727)^3 \u2248 7.730\n\nSo, 20*7.730 = 154.6\n\n42*1.9727 \u2248 82.85\n\nThus, f''(1.9727) \u2248 154.6 - 82.85 = 71.75 > 0\n\nSince f''(x) > 0, this is a local minima.\n\nSimilarly, x \u2248 -1.9727:\n\nf''(-1.9727) = 20*(-1.9727)^3 - 42*(-1.9727)\n\n(-1.9727)^3 \u2248 -7.730\n\nSo, 20*(-7.730) = -154.6\n\n-42*(-1.9727) \u2248 82.85\n\nThus, f''(-1.9727) \u2248 -154.6 + 82.85 = -71.75 < 0\n\nSince f''(x) < 0, this is a local maxima.\n\nNow, x \u2248 0.5553:\n\nf''(0.5553) = 20*(0.5553)^3 - 42*(0.5553)\n\n(0.5553)^3 \u2248 0.171\n\n20*0.171 = 3.42\n\n42*0.5553 \u2248 23.32\n\nSo, f''(0.5553) \u2248 3.42 - 23.32 = -19.9 < 0\n\nThus, this is a local maxima.\n\nAnd x \u2248 -0.5553:\n\nf''(-0.5553) = 20*(-0.5553)^3 - 42*(-0.5553)\n\n(-0.5553)^3 \u2248 -0.171\n\n20*(-0.171) = -3.42\n\n-42*(-0.5553) \u2248 23.32\n\nSo, f''(-0.5553) \u2248 -3.42 + 23.32 = 19.9 > 0\n\nThus, this is a local minima.\n\nWait a minute, this seems a bit counterintuitive. I have two local maxima and two local minima. Is that possible for this function? Let me double-check the second derivative calculations.\n\nLooking back, for x \u2248 1.9727:\n\nf''(1.9727) \u2248 71.75 > 0 \u2192 local minima\n\nx \u2248 -1.9727:\n\nf''(-1.9727) \u2248 -71.75 < 0 \u2192 local maxima\n\nx \u2248 0.5553:\n\nf''(0.5553) \u2248 -19.9 < 0 \u2192 local maxima\n\nx \u2248 -0.5553:\n\nf''(-0.5553) \u2248 19.9 > 0 \u2192 local minima\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the function has two local maxima and two local minima. That's acceptable for a fifth-degree polynomial; it can have up to four extrema.\n\nAlternatively, I could also use the first derivative test to confirm the nature of these critical points by checking the sign changes of f'(x) around each critical point.\n\nLet me consider the critical points in ascending order:\n\nx \u2248 -1.9727, -0.5553, 0.5553, 1.9727\n\nI'll test points in the intervals:\n\n(-\u221e, -1.9727), (-1.9727, -0.5553), (-0.5553, 0.5553), (0.5553, 1.9727), (1.9727, \u221e)\n\nLet me choose test points in each interval:\n\nx = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2\n\nNow, evaluate f'(x) at these points:\n\nf'(-2) = 5*(-2)^4 - 21*(-2)^2 + 6 = 5*16 - 21*4 + 6 = 80 - 84 + 6 = 2 > 0\n\nf'(-1) = 5*(-1)^4 - 21*(-1)^2 + 6 = 5*1 - 21*1 + 6 = 5 - 21 + 6 = -10 < 0\n\nf'(0) = 5*0^4 - 21*0^2 + 6 = 6 > 0\n\nf'(1) = 5*1^4 - 21*1^2 + 6 = 5 - 21 + 6 = -10 < 0\n\nf'(2) = 5*16 - 21*4 + 6 = 80 - 84 + 6 = 2 > 0\n\nSo, the sign of f'(x) changes as follows:\n\n- From positive to negative at x \u2248 -1.9727 \u2192 local maxima\n\n- From negative to positive at x \u2248 -0.5553 \u2192 local minima\n\n- From positive to negative at x \u2248 0.5553 \u2192 local maxima\n\n- From negative to positive at x \u2248 1.9727 \u2192 local minima\n\nThis confirms the results from the second derivative test.\n\nTherefore, the critical points and their nature are:\n\n- x \u2248 -1.9727: local maxima\n\n- x \u2248 -0.5553: local minima\n\n- x \u2248 0.5553: local maxima\n\n- x \u2248 1.9727: local minima\n\nFor completeness, I can also find the corresponding y-values by plugging these x-values back into f(x):\n\nf(-1.9727) \u2248 (-1.9727)^5 - 7*(-1.9727)^3 + 6*(-1.9727)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(-1.9727)^5 \u2248 -80.32\n\n-7*(-1.9727)^3 = -7*(-7.730) = 54.11\n\n6*(-1.9727) \u2248 -11.84\n\nSo, f(-1.9727) \u2248 -80.32 + 54.11 - 11.84 \u2248 -38.05\n\nSimilarly, f(-0.5553) \u2248 (-0.5553)^5 - 7*(-0.5553)^3 + 6*(-0.5553)\n\n\u2248 -0.05 -7*(-0.171) + (-3.332)\n\n\u2248 -0.05 + 1.197 - 3.332 \u2248 -2.185\n\nf(0.5553) \u2248 (0.5553)^5 - 7*(0.5553)^3 + 6*(0.5553)\n\n\u2248 0.05 -7*(0.171) + 3.332\n\n\u2248 0.05 - 1.197 + 3.332 \u2248 2.185\n\nf(1.9727) \u2248 (1.9727)^5 - 7*(1.9727)^3 + 6*(1.9727)\n\n\u2248 80.32 -7*(7.730) + 11.84\n\n\u2248 80.32 -54.11 + 11.84 \u2248 38.05\n\nSo, the critical points with their function values are approximately:\n\n- (-1.9727, -38.05): local maxima\n\n- (-0.5553, -2.185): local minima\n\n- (0.5553, 2.185): local maxima\n\n- (1.9727, 38.05): local minima\n\nI should also consider if there are any saddle points. Saddle points occur where the second derivative is zero, but in this case, the second derivative is zero nowhere between these points, as per the second derivative test.\n\nWait, to be thorough, I should check where f''(x) = 0:\n\nf''(x) = 20x^3 - 42x = 0\n\nFactor: x(20x^2 - 42) = 0\n\nSo, x = 0 or x^2 = 42/20 = 2.1\n\nThus, x = 0, x = sqrt(2.1), x = -sqrt(2.1)\n\nCalculating sqrt(2.1) \u2248 1.449\n\nSo, x \u2248 0, 1.449, -1.449\n\nBut these are not among the critical points we found earlier, as those were x \u2248 \u00b11.9727 and \u00b10.5553.\n\nWait a second, are there additional critical points where f''(x) = 0? I think I might have confused critical points of f(x) with points of inflection.\n\nLet me clarify: critical points are where f'(x) = 0, and points of inflection are where f''(x) = 0 and the concavity changes.\n\nIn this case, the critical points are where f'(x) = 0, which we've already found and classified using f''(x).\n\nThe points where f''(x) = 0 are potential points of inflection, not necessarily critical points.\n\nSo, in this function, there are points of inflection at x \u2248 0, 1.449, -1.449, but these are separate from the critical points.\n\nTherefore, the original critical points remain as x \u2248 \u00b11.9727 and \u00b10.5553, with the nature as previously determined.\n\nI think that's all for this problem. If there's anything else to consider, I'll revisit it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe critical points and their nature are:\n\n- \\( x \\approx -1.9727 \\): local maximum\n\n- \\( x \\approx -0.5553 \\): local minimum\n\n- \\( x \\approx 0.5553 \\): local maximum\n\n- \\( x \\approx 1.9727 \\): local minimum\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ x \\approx -1.9727 \\text{ (local maximum)},\\ x \\approx -0.5553 \\text{ (local minimum)},\\ x \\approx 0.5553 \\text{ (local maximum)},\\ x \\approx 1.9727 \\text{ (local minimum)} } \\]"
