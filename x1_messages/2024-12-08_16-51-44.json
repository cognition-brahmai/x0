        "content": "A compass needle aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth acts like a giant magnet, with its magnetic field extending into space. A compass needle is a small magnet that is free to rotate, and it responds to this magnetic field.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:\n\n1. **Magnetic Properties**: The compass needle is made of a magnetic material, usually iron or steel, which can be magnetized. When magnetized, it has a north-seeking pole (often marked in red or pointed) and a south-seeking pole.\n\n2. **Earth's Magnetic Field**: The Earth has its own magnetic field, which is similar to that of a bar magnet placed at an angle inside the Earth. The magnetic field has lines of force that run from the magnetic south pole to the magnetic north pole.\n\n3. **Alignment**: When you hold a compass, the needle is free to rotate until it aligns with the Earth's magnetic field lines. The north-seeking pole of the needle points towards the Earth's magnetic north pole, and the south-seeking pole points towards the magnetic south pole.\n\n4. **Practical Use**: This alignment allows you to determine direction. For example, if the red end of the needle points towards a particular direction, that direction is magnetic north. By knowing magnetic north, you can orient a map or determine other directions relative to north.\n\nIt's important to note that the Earth's magnetic poles are not exactly aligned with its geographic poles, and the magnetic field can vary slightly in different locations. Additionally, temporary magnetic disturbances or the presence of magnetic materials nearby can affect the compass reading.\n\nIn summary, the compass needle moves to align with the Earth's magnetic field, pointing towards the magnetic north pole, which helps in determining direction."
