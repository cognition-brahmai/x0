        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has a rectangular field that's 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. He wants to plant trees around the perimeter, with equal spacing between each tree, and he's going to plant one tree at each corner. Then, he plans to plant 8 more trees along each side. I need to figure out how many trees he plants in total.\n\nFirst, I should understand the layout. A rectangle has four sides: two lengths and two widths. The lengths are 100 meters each, and the widths are 50 meters each. Trees are planted at each corner, and then 8 more trees along each side.\n\nWait a minute, if he's planting trees at each corner and then 8 more along each side, I need to make sure I'm not double-counting the corner trees.\n\nLet me draw a diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine the rectangle with corners labeled A, B, C, D, where:\n\n- A is at the bottom left corner.\n\n- B is at the bottom right corner.\n\n- C is at the top right corner.\n\n- D is at the top left corner.\n\nSo, trees are planted at A, B, C, and D.\n\nNow, along each side, he plants 8 more trees.\n\nLet's consider side AB, which is the bottom side, 100 meters long.\n\nHe plants one tree at A and one at B, and then 8 more trees in between.\n\nSo, total trees on side AB: 1 (at A) + 8 (in between) + 1 (at B) = 10 trees.\n\nWait, but that seems off because if you include the corner trees, and then plant 8 more in between, that would actually be 9 trees per side, not 10.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf he plants one tree at each corner and then 8 more along each side, the 8 additional trees are between the corner trees.\n\nSo, for side AB:\n\n- Tree at A (corner)\n\n- 8 trees between A and B\n\n- Tree at B (corner)\n\nSo, total trees on side AB: 1 (A) + 8 (between) + 1 (B) = 10 trees.\n\nSimilarly, for side BC (50 meters):\n\n- Tree at B (corner)\n\n- 8 trees between B and C\n\n- Tree at C (corner)\n\nSo, 1 + 8 + 1 = 10 trees.\n\nSame for side CD (100 meters):\n\n- Tree at C (corner)\n\n- 8 trees between C and D\n\n- Tree at D (corner)\n\n1 + 8 + 1 = 10 trees.\n\nAnd for side DA (50 meters):\n\n- Tree at D (corner)\n\n- 8 trees between D and A\n\n- Tree at A (corner)\n\n1 + 8 + 1 = 10 trees.\n\nSo, each side has 10 trees.\n\nNow, since the corner trees are shared by two sides, we need to make sure we don't count them twice.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of trees without considering the overlapping corner trees.\n\nTotal trees if counting each side separately: 4 sides \u00d7 10 trees/side = 40 trees.\n\nBut since the corner trees are shared, we've counted each corner tree twice.\n\nThere are 4 corner trees, so we've double-counted 4 trees.\n\nTherefore, to get the actual total number of trees, we need to subtract the 4 extra trees we've counted.\n\nTotal trees = 40 - 4 = 36 trees.\n\nWait, but let me check this again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nLet's think about the number of trees per side, considering that the corner trees are shared.\n\nIf each side has 8 trees between the corners, plus the corner trees, but the corner trees are shared.\n\nSo, for the two longer sides (100 meters each), each has 8 trees between the corners plus 2 corner trees, but the corner trees are shared with the adjacent sides.\n\nSimilarly, for the two shorter sides (50 meters each), same logic.\n\nPerhaps it's better to calculate the total number of trees as follows:\n\nTotal trees = number of corner trees + number of trees along the sides excluding the corners.\n\nNumber of corner trees = 4.\n\nNumber of trees along the sides excluding the corners:\n\nEach side has 8 trees between the corners.\n\nThere are 4 sides, so 4 sides \u00d7 8 trees/side = 32 trees.\n\nTherefore, total trees = 4 (corners) + 32 (between corners) = 36 trees.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the perimeter.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 2 \u00d7 (length + width) = 2 \u00d7 (100 + 50) = 300 meters.\n\nIf he plants trees with equal spacing, including one at each corner, and 8 more along each side, then the spacing between trees can be calculated.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the number of trees planted around a closed figure, which is (perimeter / spacing) + 1, but since it's a closed loop, the first and last tree coincide.\n\nBut in this case, since the spacing is equal and trees are planted at equal intervals, including the corners, perhaps that's overcomplicating it.\n\nGiven that each side has 10 trees including the corners, and there are 4 sides, but the corner trees are shared, so total trees are (10 trees/side \u00d7 4 sides) - 4 (for the overlapping corners) = 40 - 4 = 36 trees.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the number of trees around a rectangle.\n\nI recall that for a rectangle, the total number of trees planted around the perimeter with one tree at each corner and equal spacing between them is:\n\nTotal trees = 2 \u00d7 (length/spacing + width/spacing) - 4.\n\nBut in this problem, we're not given the spacing directly, but rather the number of trees along each side excluding the corners.\n\nWait, in this case, since he's planting 8 trees between the corners on each side, that might help determine the spacing.\n\nFor example, on the 100-meter side, with 8 trees between the corners, plus the two corner trees, that's 10 trees.\n\nSo, the number of spaces between trees on that side is 9 (since there are 10 trees).\n\nTherefore, the spacing between trees on the 100-meter side is 100 meters / 9 spaces = approximately 11.11 meters.\n\nSimilarly, on the 50-meter side, with 8 trees between the corners plus two corner trees, that's also 10 trees.\n\nNumber of spaces between trees is 9.\n\nSpacing is 50 meters / 9 spaces \u2248 5.56 meters.\n\nWait, but this seems inconsistent because the spacing should be equal around the perimeter, but the calculations give different spacings for different sides.\n\nHmm, that can't be right.\n\nPerhaps I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the 8 additional trees along each side are in addition to the corner trees.\n\nSo, for each side, it's corner tree, then 8 trees, then the next corner tree.\n\nSo, for side AB (100 meters):\n\n- Tree at A\n\n- 8 trees between A and B\n\n- Tree at B\n\nSimilarly for side BC (50 meters):\n\n- Tree at B\n\n- 8 trees between B and C\n\n- Tree at C\n\nAnd so on for the other sides.\n\nBut as we saw, this leads to overlapping trees at the corners.\n\nMoreover, the spacing comes out differently for different sides, which contradicts the condition of equal spacing.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that he plants 8 additional trees along the entire perimeter, not per side.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because it specifies \"along each side.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"8 more trees along each side\" means 8 trees per side, not including the corner trees.\n\nWait, let's check the wording again.\n\n\"He wants to plant trees around the perimeter of the field with equal spacing between each tree. If he plants one tree at each corner and then plants 8 more trees along each side, how many trees does he plant in total?\"\n\nSo, it says \"plants one tree at each corner and then plants 8 more trees along each side.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted as planting 8 trees along each side, in addition to the corner trees.\n\nSo, per side:\n\n- Corner tree\n\n- 8 trees along the side\n\n- Next corner tree\n\nThus, 10 trees per side.\n\nBut since the corner trees are shared between two sides, the total number of trees is less than 40.\n\nAs calculated earlier, it's 36 trees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"8 more trees along each side\" means 8 trees per side, excluding the corner trees.\n\nIn that case:\n\nPer side:\n\n- 2 corner trees\n\n- 8 trees between corners\n\nTotal per side: 10 trees.\n\nBut again, with corner trees shared, total trees would be 36.\n\nWait, but if \"8 more trees along each side\" means excluding the corner trees, then per side: 8 trees plus 2 corner trees.\n\nBut that seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"8 more trees along each side\" means in addition to the corner trees.\n\nSo, per side: 2 corner trees + 8 additional trees = 10 trees per side.\n\nBut again, with corner trees shared, total trees would be 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"8 more trees along each side\" are in addition to the corner trees, but not including them.\n\nWait, but the wording is \"plants one tree at each corner and then plants 8 more trees along each side.\"\n\nSo, corner trees are planted first, and then 8 more along each side.\n\nSo, per side: corner tree, 8 trees, next corner tree.\n\nThus, 10 trees per side.\n\nBut again, with corner trees shared, total trees are 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 additional trees are distributed along the entire perimeter, not per side.\n\nBut that seems unlikely given the wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 additional trees are planted along each of the four sides, meaning 8 trees per side, in addition to the corner trees.\n\nBut that would be a total of 32 additional trees plus 4 corner trees, totaling 36 trees.\n\nWait, but that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me consider a simpler approach.\n\nIf there are 8 additional trees along each side, and 4 sides, that's 8 \u00d7 4 = 32 additional trees.\n\nPlus the 4 corner trees, total is 36 trees.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted is 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends for the 8 additional trees to be planted along the entire perimeter, not per side.\n\nBut that seems less likely given the wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 additional trees are planted along each of the two longer sides, and a different number along the shorter sides.\n\nBut the problem says \"each side,\" so likely it's 8 per side.\n\nGiven that, total trees per side: 10.\n\nWith corner trees shared, total trees: 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the farmer plants one tree at each corner and then 8 more trees along each side, including the corners.\n\nIn that case, per side: 10 trees.\n\nBut then, with corner trees shared, total trees would be 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 additional trees are planted along the sides excluding the corners.\n\nIn that case, per side: 8 trees plus 2 corner trees.\n\nBut that would be 10 trees per side, and with corner trees shared, total trees would be 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends for the 8 additional trees to be planted along the perimeter, not per side.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with \"along each side.\"\n\nGiven that, perhaps the safest approach is to assume that per side, there are 10 trees (including corners), and with corner trees shared, total trees are 36.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted is 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for this scenario.\n\nI recall that for planting around a closed figure, like a rectangle, the total number of trees is equal to the number of trees per side multiplied by the number of sides minus the number of corners.\n\nSo, total trees = (trees per side \u00d7 number of sides) - number of corners.\n\nIn this case, trees per side = 10, number of sides = 4, number of corners = 4.\n\nThus, total trees = (10 \u00d7 4) - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 trees.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted is 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the spacing to verify.\n\nFor the longer sides (100 meters):\n\nNumber of trees per longer side: 10.\n\nNumber of spaces between trees: 9.\n\nTherefore, spacing = 100 meters / 9 \u2248 11.11 meters.\n\nFor the shorter sides (50 meters):\n\nNumber of trees per shorter side: 10.\n\nNumber of spaces between trees: 9.\n\nTherefore, spacing = 50 meters / 9 \u2248 5.56 meters.\n\nWait a minute, this is inconsistent because the spacing should be equal around the perimeter.\n\nBut here, the spacing on the longer sides is different from the spacing on the shorter sides.\n\nThat can't be right, because the problem states \"with equal spacing between each tree.\"\n\nSo, if the spacing is supposed to be equal around the entire perimeter, then having different spacings on different sides would violate that condition.\n\nTherefore, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.\n\nMaybe the 8 additional trees are not per side, but rather distributed around the entire perimeter.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf the farmer plants one tree at each corner and then plants 8 more trees around the entire perimeter, with equal spacing, then the total number of trees would be the four corner trees plus eight additional trees, totaling 12 trees.\n\nBut that seems too few, and it doesn't align with the wording of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"8 more trees along each side\" means a total of 8 additional trees around the entire perimeter.\n\nIn that case, total trees would be 4 (corners) + 8 (additional) = 12 trees.\n\nBut again, that seems inconsistent with the wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that he plants one tree at each corner and then plants 8 more trees along the entire perimeter, for a total of 12 trees.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because \"along each side\" suggests per side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"8 more trees along each side\" means that on each side, in addition to the corner trees, there are 8 trees.\n\nSo, per side: 2 corner trees + 8 trees = 10 trees.\n\nTotal trees: 4 sides \u00d7 10 trees/side = 40 trees.\n\nBut again, this doesn't account for the overlapping corner trees.\n\nWait, but if corner trees are shared, then the total should be less than 40.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this scenario, since the corner trees are already included in the \"one tree at each corner,\" and then 8 more trees along each side, including the corners, it might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the \"one tree at each corner\" is separate from the \"8 more trees along each side.\"\n\nIn that case:\n\nPer side: 8 trees along the side, plus 2 corner trees.\n\nBut then, total trees would be (8 trees/side \u00d7 4 sides) + 4 corner trees = 32 + 4 = 36 trees.\n\nBut this still leads to the same total of 36 trees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 trees along each side are in addition to the corner trees, making it 10 trees per side, but with corner trees shared, total is 36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends for the 8 additional trees to be distributed around the perimeter, not per side.\n\nIn that case, total trees would be 4 (corners) + 8 (additional) = 12 trees.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with \"along each side.\"\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to consider that the farmer plants one tree at each corner and then 8 more trees along each side, with the understanding that \"along each side\" includes the corner trees.\n\nTherefore, per side: 10 trees.\n\nTotal trees: 40, but subtracting the 4 corner trees that are double-counted, total is 36 trees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends for the 8 additional trees to be planted along the sides excluding the corners.\n\nIn that case, per side: 8 trees + 2 corner trees = 10 trees.\n\nTotal trees: 40, minus 4 double-counted corner trees, equals 36 trees.\n\nGiven this consistency, I'll go with the total number of trees being 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
