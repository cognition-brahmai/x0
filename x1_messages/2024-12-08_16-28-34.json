Each plan will have an associated evidence value, which is the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user's question, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nWebSearch[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information on the internet. This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from HTML content and produces a plain text response.\nQAEngine[input]: Answers questions based on common sense, general world knowledge, and given context. The input must be a text question that references a #E[n] variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given #E1?\nLinkCollector[input]: Collects all URLs from a given text and outputs them as a newline-delimited string.\n\nThe function input should be a plain string without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAEngine[What is the capital of Michigan, given #E3?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action based on the input question]\n#E0 = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on the result of #E0]\n#E1 = [next function to call and input parameter, which may reference previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context #E0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [#En containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?"
