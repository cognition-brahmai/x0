He began to lose his hearing in his late twenties and was almost completely deaf by his late forties. Despite this, he continued to compose some of his most renowned works, including his Ninth Symphony, which is one of the most performed symphonies in the world. It's truly inspiring how he overcame such a significant challenge to create timeless music."
