        "content": "Let's see. There's a store having a sale with a 15% discount on all items. I need to find out how much a customer saves on an item that originally costs $120 after applying this discount.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a discount means. A discount is a reduction in the price of a good or service. In this case, it's a percentage reduction. So, a 15% discount means the customer pays only 85% of the original price because 100% - 15% = 85%.\n\nBut the question is asking for how much the customer saves, not how much they pay. So, I need to find out what 15% of $120 is, because that's the amount being saved.\n\nTo calculate 15% of $120, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the original price. 15% as a decimal is 0.15.\n\nSo, savings = 0.15 \u00d7 120\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.15 \u00d7 120 = 18\n\nTherefore, the customer saves $18 on the item after applying the discount.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Percent means per hundred, so 15% is 15 per 100, which is 0.15. Multiplying that by $120 should indeed give $18.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as finding 15% of 120. I know that 10% of 120 is 12, because 10% is just moving the decimal point one place to the left. Then, 5% would be half of 10%, which is 6. So, 15% should be 12 + 6 = 18. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price to find the final price, but since the question is only asking for the savings, I don't need to do that extra step.\n\nSo, the customer saves $18 on the item during the sale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
