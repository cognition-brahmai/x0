Currently, the department has 20 beds and serves an average of 100 patients per day, with an average stay of 8 hours per patient. The expansion plan includes adding 10 more beds and hiring additional staff. Calculate the increased capacity of the emergency department after the expansion, as well as the required number of nurses and doctors needed to maintain a 1:4 nurse-to-patient ratio and a 1:10 doctor-to-patient ratio. Consider shift lengths, breaks, and other staffing requirements in your calculations."

        "content": "To calculate the increased capacity of the emergency department after the expansion and determine the required number of nurses and doctors, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Current Situation\n\n- **Beds:** 20\n- **Patients per day:** 100\n- **Average stay per patient:** 8 hours\n\n### Expansion Plan\n\n- **Additional beds:** 10\n- **Total beds after expansion:** 20 + 10 = 30 beds\n\n### Increased Capacity\n\nFirst, we need to determine how the increased number of beds affects the department's capacity to serve patients.\n\nGiven that the average stay per patient is 8 hours, we can calculate the bed turnover rate.\n\n#### Bed Turnover Rate\n\nThe bed turnover rate is the number of patients served per bed per day.\n\n- **Current bed turnover rate:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Bed turnover rate} = \\frac{\\text{Patients per day}}{\\text{Beds}} = \\frac{100}{20} = 5 \\text{ patients per bed per day}\n\\]\n\n- **Assuming the same turnover rate after expansion:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{New patients per day} = \\text{Total beds after expansion} \\times \\text{Bed turnover rate} = 30 \\times 5 = 150 \\text{ patients per day}\n\\]\n\nSo, the increased capacity is 150 patients per day.\n\n### Staffing Requirements\n\nNext, we need to calculate the required number of nurses and doctors to maintain the specified ratios.\n\n#### Nurse-to-Patient Ratio\n\n- **Required ratio:** 1 nurse to 4 patients\n\n\\[\n\\text{Nurses needed} = \\frac{\\text{Patients per day}}{4} = \\frac{150}{4} = 37.5\n\\]\n\nSince we can't have half a nurse, we'll need to round up to 38 nurses.\n\n#### Doctor-to-Patient Ratio\n\n- **Required ratio:** 1 doctor to 10 patients\n\n\\[\n\\text{Doctors needed} = \\frac{\\text{Patients per day}}{10} = \\frac{150}{10} = 15 \\text{ doctors}\n\\]\n\n### Shift Lengths and Breaks\n\nTo determine the actual number of nurses and doctors to hire, we need to consider the shift lengths and breaks.\n\nAssuming a standard 8-hour shift with a 30-minute break.\n\n#### Nurse Staffing\n\n- **Patients per day:** 150\n- **Patients per hour:** \\(\\frac{150}{24} \\approx 6.25\\) patients per hour\n\nHowever, since patients stay for 8 hours, the average number of patients in the department at any given time is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average patients at any time} = \\frac{\\text{Patients per day} \\times \\text{Average stay}}{24} = \\frac{150 \\times 8}{24} = 50 \\text{ patients}\n\\]\n\n- **Nurses needed at any given time:} \\(\\frac{50}{4} = 12.5\\), rounded up to 13 nurses\n\nAssuming nurses work 8-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, their effective working time is 7.5 hours.\n\n- **Nurses per shift:} 13\n\n- **Total nurses needed per day:} Since a 24-hour day has 3 shifts, total nurses needed per day is \\(13 \\times 3 = 39\\) nurses\n\nHowever, this doesn't account for overlapping shifts or break times. To ensure coverage, we might need to hire more nurses.\n\n#### Doctor Staffing\n\nSimilarly, for doctors:\n\n- **Patients per day:** 150\n- **Patients per hour:** \\(\\frac{150}{24} \\approx 6.25\\) patients per hour\n\nAverage patients at any given time: 50 patients\n\n- **Doctors needed at any given time:} \\(\\frac{50}{10} = 5\\) doctors\n\nAssuming doctors work 8-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, their effective working time is 7.5 hours.\n\n- **Doctors per shift:} 5\n\n- **Total doctors needed per day:} \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\) doctors\n\nAgain, this is a basic calculation and might need adjustment based on actual work schedules and coverage requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter the expansion, the emergency department will have an increased capacity to serve 150 patients per day. To maintain the required nurse-to-patient and doctor-to-patient ratios, the hospital will need to hire approximately 39 nurses and 15 doctors per day, considering standard 8-hour shifts with breaks.\n\nThese calculations provide a baseline and may need to be adjusted based on specific hospital policies, patient acuity levels, and other factors."
