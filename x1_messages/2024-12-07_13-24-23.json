Let's assume we have an equation of the form:\n\n\\[ a(x, y, z) \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} + b(x, y, z) \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = c(x, y, z) \\]\n\nWhere \\( z = z(x, y) \\) is the unknown function, and \\( a, b, c \\) are given functions.\n\nThe method of characteristics involves constructing a family of curves, called characteristics, along which the PDE becomes an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Form the characteristic equations:**\n\n   The characteristic equations are derived from the PDE and are given by:\n\n   \\[ \\frac{dx}{a(x, y, z)} = \\frac{dy}{b(x, y, z)} = \\frac{dz}{c(x, y, z)} \\]\n\n2. **Solve the characteristic equations:**\n\n   To solve these equations, we need to find relations between \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\) that remain constant along the characteristics. This is typically done by solving two separate ODEs.\n\n   - First, choose any two differentials from the characteristic equations to form a ratio and set it equal to a parameter, say \\( t \\). For example:\n\n     \\[ \\frac{dx}{a} = \\frac{dy}{b} = \\frac{dz}{c} = dt \\]\n\n   - From this, we can write:\n\n     \\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = a(x, y, z), \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = b(x, y, z), \\quad \\frac{dz}{dt} = c(x, y, z) \\]\n\n3. **Integrate the ODEs:**\n\n   Solve these ODEs to find \\( x(t), y(t), \\) and \\( z(t) \\). This might require solving a system of coupled ODEs, which can be challenging depending on the forms of \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Find the general solution:**\n\n   The general solution of the PDE can be expressed in terms of the constants of integration from the characteristic equations. These constants can be functions of each other, leading to the general solution.\n\n5. **Apply initial conditions:**\n\n   If initial conditions are provided, use them to determine specific solutions from the general solution.\n\nLet's consider a simple example to illustrate this process. Suppose we have the PDE:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = 1 \\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 \\).\n\n1. **Form the characteristic equations:**\n\n   \\[ \\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dy}{1} = \\frac{dz}{1} \\]\n\n2. **Solve the characteristic equations:**\n\n   - From \\( \\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dy}{1} \\), we get \\( x - y = c_1 \\), where \\( c_1 \\) is a constant.\n\n   - From \\( \\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dz}{1} \\), we get \\( z - x = c_2 \\), where \\( c_2 \\) is another constant.\n\n3. **General solution:**\n\n   The general solution is given by \\( c_2 = f(c_1) \\), where \\( f \\) is an arbitrary function. Therefore:\n\n   \\[ z - x = f(x - y) \\]\n\n   Or, equivalently:\n\n   \\[ z = x + f(x - y) \\]\n\n4. **Apply initial conditions:**\n\n   If an initial condition is provided, such as \\( z(x, 0) = h(x) \\), substitute into the general solution to find \\( f \\):\n\n   \\[ h(x) = x + f(x) \\]\n\n   Thus, \\( f(x) = h(x) - x \\), and the specific solution is:\n\n   \\[ z = x + h(x - y) - (x - y) = y + h(x - y) \\]\n\nThis is a basic example, and more complex PDEs may require more sophisticated techniques, but this should give you an idea of how the method of characteristics works for first-order PDEs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{z = x + f(x - y)} \\]"
