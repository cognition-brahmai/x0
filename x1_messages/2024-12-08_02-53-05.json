        "content": "No, daddy longlegs are not the most venomous spiders in the world. In fact, there is some confusion about whether they are even spiders. Daddy longlegs, also known as harvestmen, belong to a different order of arachnids called Opiliones, and they do not have venom glands or fangs like true spiders do. So, they are not venomous at all. The myth about their venom being the most potent might stem from confusion with another type of arachnid or from misidentifying them as spiders."
