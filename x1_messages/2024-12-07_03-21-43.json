        "content": "Let's tackle this savings goal step by step. So, the person wants to save $20,000 in 4 years by making monthly deposits into a savings account that offers an annual interest rate of 2%, compounded monthly. We need to figure out how much they should deposit each month to reach their target.\n\nFirst, let's understand the components involved here:\n\n1. **Future Value (FV):** This is the amount the person wants to have in the account after 4 years, which is $20,000.\n\n2. **Interest Rate:** The annual interest rate is 2%, and since it's compounded monthly, we need to adjust this rate to a monthly rate.\n\n3. **Time Period:** The time frame is 4 years, but since deposits are made monthly, we'll need to convert this into the total number of months.\n\n4. **Monthly Deposit (PMT):** This is what we're trying to find out. It's the amount deposited each month.\n\nThe formula to calculate the future value of a series of monthly deposits with compound interest is:\n\n\\[ FV = PMT \\times \\left( \\frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( FV \\) is the future value of the investment.\n\n- \\( PMT \\) is the amount of each monthly deposit.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the monthly interest rate.\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of deposits (months).\n\nWe need to rearrange this formula to solve for \\( PMT \\):\n\n\\[ PMT = \\frac{FV \\times r}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \\]\n\nLet's plug in the values we know:\n\n1. **Future Value (FV):** $20,000\n\n2. **Annual Interest Rate:** 2%\n\n   - Monthly Interest Rate (\\( r \\)): \\( \\frac{2\\%}{12} = \\frac{0.02}{12} \\approx 0.001667 \\)\n\n3. **Time Period:** 4 years\n\n   - Total number of months (\\( n \\)): \\( 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\) months\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ PMT = \\frac{20000 \\times 0.001667}{(1 + 0.001667)^{48} - 1} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[ (1 + 0.001667)^{48} - 1 \\]\n\nLet's compute \\( 1 + 0.001667 = 1.001667 \\)\n\nNow, raise this to the power of 48:\n\n\\[ 1.001667^{48} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\[ 1.001667^{48} \\approx 1.083 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 1:\n\n\\[ 1.083 - 1 = 0.083 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 20000 \\times 0.001667 \\approx 33.34 \\]\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\n\\[ PMT = \\frac{33.34}{0.083} \\approx 401.69 \\]\n\nTherefore, the person needs to deposit approximately $401.69 each month to reach their savings goal of $20,000 in 4 years with a 2% annual interest rate, compounded monthly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{401.69} \\]"
