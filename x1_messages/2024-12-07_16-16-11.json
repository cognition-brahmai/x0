Each step of your plan should be accompanied by an evidence value that represents the output of one of the functions given a specific input string, which can either be the user's question, one or more previous evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools you have at your disposal:\nWebSearch[input]: This tool allows the user to search for information on the internet. It is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question. The function doesn't directly provide the answer; it finds a list of sites that might.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts plain text from one or more websites provided in the input string containing newline delimited links. The input must be one or more links and the output will be plain text content from these links.\nLinkFilter[input]: Filters out irrelevant links from a plain text list of links and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of relevant links.\nQAModel[input]: A question answering model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :evidence[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nEach function takes a plain string as input, without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAModel[What is the capital of Michigan, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure each plan step has only one evidence output.\n\nThe output format should be:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020 and what was their contribution?"
