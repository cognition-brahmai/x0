        "content": "So I've got this question here: if a bacteria population doubles every 20 minutes, how many times will it double in 6 hours? Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the time frames involved. The bacteria double every 20 minutes, and I want to know how many times this doubling occurs in 6 hours.\n\nAlright, so I know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, right? So, 6 hours would be 6 times 60, which is 360 minutes.\n\nNow, if the bacteria double every 20 minutes, I can find out how many 20-minute intervals there are in 360 minutes. That should tell me how many times the population doubles.\n\nSo, I'll divide 360 minutes by 20 minutes per doubling.\n\n360 \u00f7 20 = 18.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing here?\n\nLet me double-check. The population doubles every 20 minutes, and in 6 hours, which is 360 minutes, there are 18 intervals of 20 minutes. So, the population should double 18 times.\n\nBut, I recall that with exponential growth, sometimes people get confused about whether to include the initial amount or something like that. But in this case, the question is specifically asking for how many times it doubles, not the final population size.\n\nSo, starting from time zero, after 20 minutes, it doubles once; after 40 minutes, it doubles twice; and so on, up to 360 minutes.\n\nLet me just verify with a smaller time frame to make sure.\n\nSuppose we have 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Dividing 60 by 20 gives 3. So, in 1 hour, the population should double 3 times.\n\nWait a minute, starting at time zero, first doubling at 20 minutes, second at 40 minutes, and third at 60 minutes. Yes, that's 3 doublings in 1 hour.\n\nSimilarly, in 2 hours, which is 120 minutes, 120 divided by 20 is 6, so 6 doublings.\n\nSo, scaling up to 6 hours, 360 minutes, divided by 20 minutes per doubling, gives 18 doublings.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider, like the growth rate or something? The question seems to be straightforward about the doubling time.\n\nI think the answer is 18 times.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
