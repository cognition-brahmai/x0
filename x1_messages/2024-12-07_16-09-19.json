        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have packs of cookies available in sizes of 3, 5, and 7. I need to buy one pack at a time, and I want to end up with an equal number of each type of cookie. What's the smallest number of cookies I can have to satisfy this condition?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to have an equal number of each type of cookie. That means the total number of cookies from each pack size should be the same. Let's denote the number of packs of 3 as x, the number of packs of 5 as y, and the number of packs of 7 as z. So, the total number of cookies from each pack type would be 3x, 5y, and 7z, respectively.\n\nSince I want an equal number of each type of cookie, 3x = 5y = 7z. Let's call this common number of cookies \"n\". So, 3x = n, 5y = n, and 7z = n.\n\nThis means that n must be a multiple of 3, 5, and 7. In other words, n must be a common multiple of 3, 5, and 7. To find the smallest such n, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nLet's calculate the LCM of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nFirst, find the prime factors of each number:\n\n- 3 is prime: 3\n\n- 5 is prime: 5\n\n- 7 is prime: 7\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved. Since all numbers are prime and appear only once, the LCM is 3 * 5 * 7 = 105.\n\nSo, the smallest n that satisfies 3x = 5y = 7z is 105.\n\nNow, to find out how many packs of each size I need to buy:\n\n- For packs of 3: x = n / 3 = 105 / 3 = 35 packs\n\n- For packs of 5: y = n / 5 = 105 / 5 = 21 packs\n\n- For packs of 7: z = n / 7 = 105 / 7 = 15 packs\n\nBut wait a minute, the problem says I can only buy one pack at a time, but it doesn't specify that I have to buy different packs in a specific order or anything like that. It just says I can buy one pack at a time, and I need to end up with an equal number of each type of cookie.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A bakery sells cookies in packs of 3, 5, and 7. If you can only buy one pack at a time, what is the smallest number of cookies you can purchase that will give you an equal number of each type of cookie?\"\n\nAlright, so perhaps I need to consider that each pack type contains cookies of a specific type. Wait, no, the problem says \"each type of cookie\", but the packs are just different sizes. So, are the cookies in different packs different types, or are they all the same type but just come in different pack sizes?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let's assume that the packs are of the same type of cookie, but just different quantities. So, a pack of 3 has 3 cookies, a pack of 5 has 5 cookies, and a pack of 7 has 7 cookies. All cookies are the same type, but packed in different quantities.\n\nBut the problem says \"equal number of each type of cookie\". If all cookies are the same type, then why would I need an equal number of each type?\n\nWait, maybe the packs contain different types of cookies. For example, pack of 3 contains type A, pack of 5 contains type B, and pack of 7 contains type C. So, I need to have an equal number of type A, B, and C cookies.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, if I buy x packs of 3 (type A), y packs of 5 (type B), and z packs of 7 (type C), then the total number of type A cookies is 3x, type B is 5y, and type C is 7z. I need 3x = 5y = 7z.\n\nLet's denote the common number of cookies as n, so 3x = n, 5y = n, and 7z = n.\n\nTherefore, n must be a multiple of 3, 5, and 7. The smallest such n is the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 5, and 7, which is 105, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the smallest number of cookies I can purchase to have an equal number of each type is 105.\n\nBut the problem asks for the smallest number of cookies you can purchase that will give you an equal number of each type of cookie. Wait, but if I have 105 cookies of each type, that's 105 type A, 105 type B, and 105 type C, totaling 315 cookies.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to have fewer total cookies while still having an equal number of each type.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the smallest total number of cookies such that the number of type A, type B, and type C cookies are equal, given that I can only buy packs of 3, 5, and 7, respectively.\n\nSo, total cookies would be 3x + 5y + 7z, with the constraint that 3x = 5y = 7z.\n\nBut this seems similar to what I did before. Let me see.\n\nLet\u2019s set 3x = 5y = 7z = n.\n\nThen, x = n/3, y = n/5, z = n/7.\n\nSince x, y, z must be integers (you can't buy a fraction of a pack), n must be a multiple of 3, 5, and 7, so n must be a common multiple of these numbers. The least such n is 105.\n\nTherefore, x = 105/3 = 35 packs of 3,\n\ny = 105/5 = 21 packs of 5,\n\nz = 105/7 = 15 packs of 7.\n\nTotal cookies would be 3*35 + 5*21 + 7*15 = 105 + 105 + 105 = 315 cookies.\n\nBut is there a way to have fewer total cookies while still having an equal number of each type?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can find a smaller n where n is a multiple of the least common multiple of the pack sizes, but that doesn't make sense because 105 is already the LCM of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that I can buy multiple packs of the same size, but I need to minimize the total number of cookies, while having an equal number of each type.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the least common multiple of the pack sizes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to set up equations to find the smallest n such that n is divisible by 3, 5, and 7, and then find the corresponding x, y, z.\n\nBut I think I've already done that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the problem differently.\n\nSuppose I buy a certain number of packs of each size, and I want the total number of cookies from each pack type to be equal.\n\nSo, if I buy x packs of 3, y packs of 5, and z packs of 7, then 3x = 5y = 7z.\n\nLet\u2019s set 3x = 5y = 7z = k.\n\nThen, x = k/3, y = k/5, z = k/7.\n\nSince x, y, z must be integers, k must be a multiple of 3, 5, and 7, so k is a common multiple of 3, 5, and 7. The least such k is 105.\n\nTherefore, x = 35, y = 21, z = 15.\n\nTotal cookies would be 3*35 + 5*21 + 7*15 = 105 + 105 + 105 = 315.\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to have a smaller total by buying different combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I can buy more packs of smaller sizes to balance it out.\n\nLet me try to see.\n\nSuppose I buy 5 packs of 7 (type C), so 35 type C cookies.\n\nThen, to have 35 type A cookies, I need 3x = 35, but 35 is not divisible by 3, so x is not integer.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSimilarly, for type B, 5y = 35, y = 7, which is integer.\n\nSo, if I buy 7 packs of 5 (type B), that's 35 type B cookies.\n\nThen, for type A, 3x = 35, but 35 is not divisible by 3, so x is not integer.\n\nAgain, not possible.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I buy 3 packs of 7 (type C), that's 21 type C cookies.\n\nThen, for type A, 3x = 21, x = 7.\n\nFor type B, 5y = 21, but 21 is not divisible by 5, so y is not integer.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAlternatively, buy 4 packs of 7, that's 28.\n\n3x = 28, x = 28/3, not integer.\n\n5y = 28, y = 28/5, not integer.\n\nNot possible.\n\nWait, maybe there's no smaller n than 105 that satisfies the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the number of each type of cookie is n, and the total number of cookies is 3n.\n\nWait, no, because n is the number of each type, and there are three types, so total cookies would be 3n.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, n = 105, so total cookies would be 3*105 = 315.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to have n smaller than 105 by buying packs in such a way that the number of each type of cookie is equal, but less than 105.\n\nBut mathematically, since n must be a multiple of 3, 5, and 7, the smallest such n is 105.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"A bakery sells cookies in packs of 3, 5, and 7. If you can only buy one pack at a time, what is the smallest number of cookies you can purchase that will give you an equal number of each type of cookie?\"\n\nPerhaps the packs correspond to different types of cookies, and I need an equal number of each type.\n\nSo, pack of 3 is type A, pack of 5 is type B, pack of 7 is type C.\n\nI need to have the same number of type A, B, and C cookies.\n\nSo, if I buy x packs of type A, y packs of type B, and z packs of type C, then the total number of type A cookies is 3x, type B is 5y, and type C is 7z.\n\nI need 3x = 5y = 7z.\n\nLet\u2019s denote this common number as n, so 3x = n, 5y = n, 7z = n.\n\nThus, n must be a multiple of 3, 5, and 7, so n = LCM(3,5,7) = 105.\n\nTherefore, x = 35, y = 21, z = 15.\n\nTotal cookies would be 3*35 + 5*21 + 7*15 = 105 + 105 + 105 = 315.\n\nIs there any way to have a smaller total?\n\nWait, maybe if I buy fewer packs but still achieve equal numbers.\n\nWait, but 105 is the smallest n that is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can buy packs in a combination where the number of each type of cookie is equal, but less than 105.\n\nWait, is there a smaller n where n is divisible by 3, 5, and 7?\n\nNo, because 105 is the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of cookies I can purchase to have an equal number of each type is 315.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nSuppose I buy 35 packs of type A (3 cookies each): 35*3 = 105 cookies.\n\nBuy 21 packs of type B (5 cookies each): 21*5 = 105 cookies.\n\nBuy 15 packs of type C (7 cookies each): 15*7 = 105 cookies.\n\nTotal cookies: 105 + 105 + 105 = 315.\n\nIs there a way to have, say, n=105 cookies in total?\n\nBut that would mean having 105 cookies divided equally among three types, so 35 cookies of each type.\n\nBut to get 35 cookies of type A, I need 35/3 \u2248 11.67 packs, which is not integer.\n\nSimilarly, for type B, 35/5 = 7 packs.\n\nFor type C, 35/7 = 5 packs.\n\nBut since I need integer packs, and 35 is not divisible by 3 for type A, it's impossible to have 35 cookies of each type.\n\nTherefore, 105 is indeed the smallest n where n is divisible by 3, 5, and 7, which is 105.\n\nHence, the smallest total number of cookies is 315.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of Diophantine equations.\n\nWe have 3x = 5y = 7z = n.\n\nSo, 3x = n, 5y = n, 7z = n.\n\nThus, n is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7.\n\nHence, n is a multiple of LCM(3,5,7) = 105.\n\nTherefore, the smallest n is 105, and the corresponding x, y, z are 35, 21, 15.\n\nTotal cookies: 3*35 + 5*21 + 7*15 = 105 + 105 + 105 = 315.\n\nSo, the smallest number of cookies I can purchase to have an equal number of each type is 315.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{315} \\]"
