However, in general, if a teacher suspects that a student has plagiarized their assignment, they may take several steps to address the issue. These may include reviewing the assignment for similarities to other sources, discussing the matter with the student, and reporting the incident to school authorities for further investigation and potential disciplinary action. It's important to note that plagiarism is a serious academic offense that can have consequences for a student's academic career and reputation."
