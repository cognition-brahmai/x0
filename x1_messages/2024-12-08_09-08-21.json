        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 houses in the village, and each house has 5 people living in it. So, initially, there are 10 houses \u00d7 5 people per house = 50 people in total.\n\nThen, 3 families decide to move out. Since each family lives in one house and each house has 5 people, moving out 3 families means 3 houses are emptying. So, 3 houses \u00d7 5 people per house = 15 people are leaving.\n\nTherefore, the number of people left in the village is the initial 50 people minus the 15 people who moved out, which is 50 - 15 = 35 people.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure about the term \"families.\" Does each house represent a family, or could there be multiple families in one house? The question says each house has 5 people living in it, but it doesn't specify if those 5 people are all part of one family or if there are multiple families in a house.\n\nGiven that it's a village and each house has 5 people, it's possible that each house is a single family, but it's also possible that there are multiple smaller families per house. However, the question mentions that 3 families decide to move out, and it's likely that each house corresponds to one family, given the context.\n\nAlternatively, if a family is defined as a group of people related by blood or marriage, and each house has 5 people who are a single family, then moving out 3 families would mean 3 houses becoming empty, as I initially thought.\n\nBut perhaps there are houses with multiple families. For example, maybe some houses have two families living together. But the question seems to suggest that each house has 5 people, and it's probably a single family.\n\nTo make it clearer, let's assume that each house corresponds to one family. Therefore, 3 families moving out would mean 3 houses are emptied, and since each house has 5 people, 15 people leave the village.\n\nThus, 50 original people - 15 people who moved out = 35 people left in the village.\n\nAlternatively, if a family is smaller than a house, say, if there are multiple families per house, then the calculation would be different. For example, if each house has 2 families of 2.5 people each (which doesn't make much sense, since you can't have half a person), or some other configuration.\n\nBut given that the question states each house has 5 people, and 3 families move out, it's most straightforward to assume that each house is a single family unit.\n\nTherefore, my answer remains that there are 35 people left in the village after 3 families move out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]"
