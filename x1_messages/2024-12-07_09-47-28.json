        "content": "So I've got this problem here: I'm playing a game where I roll two fair six-sided dice, and if the sum is 7 or greater, I win. I need to find out the probability of winning the game. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Since each die has 6 faces, and the dice are fair, each die is independent of the other. So, the total number of possible outcomes should be 6 times 6, which is 36. That makes sense because each face of the first die can pair with any face of the second die.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 36 outcomes result in a sum of 7 or greater. So, I should list out all the possible sums and count how many are 7 or more.\n\nLet me list the possible sums:\n\n- For a sum of 2: (1,1) \u2014 only one way.\n\n- For a sum of 3: (1,2), (2,1) \u2014 two ways.\n\n- For a sum of 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) \u2014 three ways.\n\n- For a sum of 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) \u2014 four ways.\n\n- For a sum of 6: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1) \u2014 five ways.\n\n- For a sum of 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \u2014 six ways.\n\n- For a sum of 8: (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2) \u2014 five ways.\n\n- For a sum of 9: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) \u2014 four ways.\n\n- For a sum of 10: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) \u2014 three ways.\n\n- For a sum of 11: (5,6), (6,5) \u2014 two ways.\n\n- For a sum of 12: (6,6) \u2014 one way.\n\nOkay, now I need to add up the number of outcomes that give a sum of 7 or greater. So, sum of 7: 6 ways; sum of 8: 5 ways; sum of 9: 4 ways; sum of 10: 3 ways; sum of 11: 2 ways; sum of 12: 1 way.\n\nAdding those up: 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21.\n\nSo, there are 21 winning outcomes out of a total of 36 possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning is 21/36. I can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3, which gives me 7/12.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the complement: the probability of not winning, which is rolling a sum of less than 7, and then subtracting that from 1.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the number of outcomes where the sum is less than 7, which means sums of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nFrom my earlier list:\n\n- Sum of 2: 1 way\n\n- Sum of 3: 2 ways\n\n- Sum of 4: 3 ways\n\n- Sum of 5: 4 ways\n\n- Sum of 6: 5 ways\n\nSo, total number of outcomes with sum less than 7 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the probability of not winning is 15/36, which simplifies to 5/12.\n\nThen, the probability of winning is 1 - 5/12 = 7/12.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result. Good, that makes sense.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using expected values or something else, but I think for probability questions involving discrete events like dice rolls, calculating the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes is the most straightforward method.\n\nI should also consider whether the dice are distinguishable or not. In this case, since we're dealing with sums, the order doesn't matter. For example, a sum of 7 can be achieved with (1,6), (2,5), etc., and we've already accounted for all combinations.\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I treated the dice as ordered pairs, like (1,2) is different from (2,1). But since the dice are fair and independent, that's correct. The outcome (1,2) is different from (2,1), and both are distinct and equally likely.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the dice as indistinguishable, but that would change the number of equally likely outcomes. For example, with indistinguishable dice, there are fewer unique outcomes because (1,2) and (2,1) are considered the same. However, in that case, the probabilities would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, it's better to stick with the approach where dice are distinguishable, as I did initially, because it's easier to count the total number of outcomes as 36, with each ordered pair being equally likely.\n\nLet me double-check my addition for the winning outcomes. Sum of 7: 6, sum of 8: 5, sum of 9: 4, sum of 10: 3, sum of 11: 2, sum of 12: 1. Total is indeed 21.\n\nAnd 21 out of 36 simplifies to 7/12.\n\nSo, the probability of winning the game is 7/12.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{12}} \\]"
