        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a car rental company with a total of 120 cars in its fleet. The ratio of sedans to SUVs is currently 3:2. We need to find out how many more sedans the company needs to purchase to make the ratio of sedans to SUVs 1:1.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the current ratio means. A ratio of 3:2 for sedans to SUVs means that for every 3 sedans, there are 2 SUVs. To find out how many sedans and SUVs there are, we can set up a proportion.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of sedans as S and the number of SUVs as V. According to the ratio:\n\nS / V = 3 / 2\n\nAnd we know that the total number of cars is:\n\nS + V = 120\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations to find the values of S and V.\n\nFrom the ratio S / V = 3 / 2, we can express S in terms of V:\n\nS = (3/2) * V\n\nNow, substitute this expression into the total number of cars:\n\n(3/2) * V + V = 120\n\nTo combine the terms, we need a common denominator, which is 2:\n\n(3V + 2V) / 2 = 120\n\n5V / 2 = 120\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n5V = 240\n\nThen, divide both sides by 5:\n\nV = 48\n\nSo, there are 48 SUVs. Now, plug this back into the expression for S:\n\nS = (3/2) * 48 = 72\n\nTherefore, there are 72 sedans and 48 SUVs.\n\nNow, the company wants to make the ratio of sedans to SUVs 1:1 by purchasing more sedans. Let\u2019s denote the number of additional sedans to be purchased as X.\n\nAfter purchasing X sedans, the number of sedans will be 72 + X, and the number of SUVs remains 48. The desired ratio is 1:1, which means the number of sedans should equal the number of SUVs:\n\n72 + X = 48\n\nNow, solve for X:\n\nX = 48 - 72 = -24\n\nWait a minute, this gives X = -24. But purchasing a negative number of sedans doesn't make sense. This suggests that the company already has more sedans than SUVs, and to make the ratio 1:1, they don't need to purchase more sedans; instead, they would need to reduce the number of sedans.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks for how many more sedans the company needs to purchase to make the ratio 1:1. Given that purchasing a negative number isn't possible, it seems there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nWe have S = 72 and V = 48 initially. To have a 1:1 ratio, the number of sedans should equal the number of SUVs.\n\nSo, 72 + X = 48\n\nSolving for X gives X = 48 - 72 = -24\n\nThis indicates that the company needs to decrease the number of sedans by 24 to match the number of SUVs, not purchase more sedans.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for how many more sedans to purchase (implying X should be positive), there seems to be a mismatch.\n\nPerhaps the problem is misinterpreted. Let's consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company has 120 cars in total, with a certain number of sedans and SUVs in a 3:2 ratio. Let's verify the initial counts.\n\nGiven the ratio 3:2, the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nEach part represents 120 / 5 = 24 cars.\n\nTherefore, sedans are 3 parts * 24 = 72, and SUVs are 2 parts * 24 = 48.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, to make the ratio 1:1, the number of sedans and SUVs should be equal. Since there are currently 72 sedans and 48 SUVs, to make them equal, we need to make both numbers the same.\n\nThe easiest way is to make both equal to 48, but that would mean reducing the number of sedans, which isn't purchasing more.\n\nAlternatively, if the company wants to maintain the current number of SUVs and increase the number of sedans to match them, they would need to increase sedans to 48, which would require purchasing 48 - 72 = -24 sedans, which again doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company wants to increase both the sedans and SUVs, but that would change the total number of cars.\n\nWait, maybe the interpretation is that the company wants to have an equal number of sedans and SUVs, but without changing the number of SUVs.\n\nIn that case, they would need to purchase additional sedans to match the number of SUVs.\n\nBut in this scenario, since there are already 72 sedans and only 48 SUVs, purchasing more sedans would only increase the disparity.\n\nWait, perhaps the company wants to have an equal number of sedans and SUVs in the entire fleet.\n\nGiven that, they need to have the same number of sedans and SUVs.\n\nCurrently, they have 72 sedans and 48 SUVs.\n\nTo make the number of sedans equal to the number of SUVs, they need to have 48 sedans and 48 SUVs.\n\nBut that would require reducing the number of sedans by 24, not purchasing more.\n\nAlternatively, if they want to increase the number of sedans to match the number of SUVs, but that doesn't make sense because they already have more sedans.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company wants to have an equal number of sedans and SUVs in the fleet, but with the total number of cars remaining the same.\n\nWait, that's not possible because currently, there are 72 sedans and 48 SUVs, totaling 120 cars.\n\nTo have an equal number of sedans and SUVs, they would need 60 sedans and 60 SUVs, which would require 120 cars in total.\n\nBut they already have 120 cars, so it's not possible without either adding or removing cars.\n\nWait, perhaps the company wants to purchase additional sedans and SUVs to make the ratio 1:1 with a new total.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nSuppose the company purchases X sedans and Y SUVs.\n\nThe new number of sedans would be 72 + X, and the new number of SUVs would be 48 + Y.\n\nTo have a 1:1 ratio, we need:\n\n72 + X = 48 + Y\n\nSimplifying:\n\nX - Y = 48 - 72\n\nX - Y = -24\n\nThis means that the number of additional sedans purchased minus the number of additional SUVs purchased should be -24.\n\nThis implies that if the company purchases Y SUVs and X sedans, with X = Y - 24.\n\nBut this doesn't directly answer the question, which seems to ask only about purchasing additional sedans, not changing the number of SUVs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company only purchases sedans and doesn't change the number of SUVs.\n\nIn that case, Y = 0, and X = -24, which again doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company purchases only sedans, increasing the number of sedans while keeping the number of SUVs constant.\n\nIn that case, to make the number of sedans equal to the number of SUVs, we need:\n\n72 + X = 48\n\nSolving for X: X = 48 - 72 = -24\n\nAgain, this suggests reducing the number of sedans, not purchasing more.\n\nThis suggests that, under the current conditions, the company cannot achieve a 1:1 ratio by purchasing more sedans without also changing the number of SUVs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company can purchase both sedans and SUVs in such a way that the ratio becomes 1:1.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, X - Y = -24\n\nThis means that for every additional SUV purchased, an additional sedan must also be purchased, but with the constraint that the difference X - Y = -24.\n\nFor example, if the company purchases 24 more SUVs (Y = 24) and 0 more sedans (X = 0), then:\n\n72 + 0 = 48 + 24 \u2192 72 = 72, which satisfies the 1:1 ratio.\n\nSimilarly, if the company purchases 25 SUVs and 1 sedan, then:\n\n72 + 1 = 48 + 25 \u2192 73 = 73, which also satisfies the ratio.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks for how many more sedans the company needs to purchase, implying that Y = 0, which leads to X = -24, which isn't feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company cannot purchase additional sedans without also adjusting the number of SUVs to achieve the desired ratio.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the problem is misstated or there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company wants to have an equal number of sedans and SUVs in the fleet, but with the total number of cars increasing.\n\nIn that case, let's suppose the company purchases X additional sedans and Y additional SUVs.\n\nThe new total number of sedans would be 72 + X, and the new total number of SUVs would be 48 + Y.\n\nTo have a 1:1 ratio:\n\n72 + X = 48 + Y\n\nSimplifying:\n\nX - Y = -24\n\nThis equation represents the relationship between X and Y to achieve the 1:1 ratio.\n\nIf the company decides not to purchase any additional SUVs (Y = 0), then X = -24, which isn't possible.\n\nIf the company purchases Y additional SUVs, then X = Y - 24.\n\nTo have X \u2265 0 (since purchasing a negative number of sedans doesn't make sense), Y must be at least 24.\n\nSo, if Y = 24, then X = 0.\n\nThis means the company purchases 24 additional SUVs and no additional sedans, resulting in:\n\n72 sedans and 48 + 24 = 72 SUVs, achieving the 1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, if Y = 25, then X = 1.\n\nSo, purchase 25 additional SUVs and 1 additional sedan, resulting in 73 sedans and 73 SUVs.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut again, the problem specifically asks for how many more sedans need to be purchased, implying that Y = 0, which leads to X = -24, which isn't feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company can only purchase sedans, in which case, to make the number of sedans equal to the number of SUVs, they would need to reduce the number of sedans, which contradicts the idea of \"purchasing\" more sedans.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that the company wants to have an equal number of sedans and SUVs, but without specifying whether the total number of cars can change.\n\nIn that case, to have an equal number, the company can either:\n\n1. Reduce the number of sedans to match the number of SUVs, or\n\n2. Increase the number of SUVs to match the number of sedans.\n\nSince the question is about purchasing more sedans, which would increase the number of sedans, this seems contradictory because purchasing more sedans would only increase the disparity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the initial interpretation of the ratio.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current number of sedans as S and SUVs as V.\n\nGiven:\n\nS / V = 3 / 2\n\nAnd S + V = 120\n\nFrom S / V = 3 / 2, we get S = (3/2) V\n\nSubstitute into S + V = 120:\n\n(3/2) V + V = 120\n\n(5/2) V = 120\n\nV = 120 * 2 / 5 = 48\n\nThen S = (3/2) * 48 = 72\n\nSo, S = 72, V = 48\n\nNow, let\u2019s say the company purchases X additional sedans to make the ratio 1:1.\n\nThe new number of sedans would be 72 + X, and the number of SUVs remains 48.\n\nTo have a 1:1 ratio:\n\n72 + X = 48\n\nX = 48 - 72 = -24\n\nAgain, this suggests reducing the number of sedans by 24, not purchasing more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company wants to have an equal number of sedans and SUVs in the fleet, but with the total number of cars being different.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the company purchases X additional sedans and Y additional SUVs.\n\nThe new totals would be:\n\nSedans: 72 + X\n\nSUVs: 48 + Y\n\nTo have a 1:1 ratio:\n\n72 + X = 48 + Y\n\nX - Y = -24\n\nThis equation shows the relationship between X and Y.\n\nIf the company doesn't purchase any additional SUVs (Y = 0), then X = -24, which isn't feasible.\n\nIf the company purchases Y additional SUVs, then X = Y - 24.\n\nTo have X \u2265 0, Y must be at least 24.\n\nSo, the company needs to purchase at least 24 additional SUVs and can purchase additional sedans such that X = Y - 24.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Purchase 24 SUVs and 0 sedans: 72 sedans and 72 SUVs\n\n- Purchase 25 SUVs and 1 sedan: 73 sedans and 73 SUVs\n\n- And so on.\n\nBut again, the question seems to ask specifically about purchasing sedans, implying Y = 0, which leads to X = -24, meaning reducing sedans, which contradicts the idea of \"purchasing\" more sedans.\n\nGiven this inconsistency, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in the interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company wants to purchase only sedans and adjust the number of SUVs sold or removed to achieve the 1:1 ratio, but that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company can only purchase sedans and needs to adjust the ratio accordingly.\n\nIn that case, if the company purchases X additional sedans, the new number of sedans would be 72 + X, and the number of SUVs remains 48.\n\nTo have a 1:1 ratio:\n\n72 + X = 48\n\nX = -24\n\nWhich again suggests reducing sedans, not purchasing more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company wants to have a 1:1 ratio by only purchasing sedans and increasing the total number of cars.\n\nIn that case, the new number of sedans would be 72 + X, and the number of SUVs remains 48.\n\nTo have a 1:1 ratio, 72 + X = 48, which again gives X = -24, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the ratio interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is interpreted differently.\n\nSometimes ratios are expressed in terms of parts.\n\nGiven a 3:2 ratio of sedans to SUVs, meaning for every 3 sedans, there are 2 SUVs.\n\nTotal parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nEach part represents 120 / 5 = 24 cars.\n\nSo, sedans: 3 * 24 = 72\n\nSUVs: 2 * 24 = 48\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTo make the ratio 1:1, meaning 1 part sedans to 1 part SUVs, each part would be equal.\n\nBut with current numbers, 72 sedans and 48 SUVs, to make them equal, either reduce sedans to 48 or increase SUVs to 72.\n\nBut the question is about purchasing more sedans, which would increase the number of sedans beyond 72, making the ratio skewed further in favor of sedans.\n\nThis suggests that purchasing more sedans wouldn't help in achieving a 1:1 ratio unless SUVs are also increased accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company wants to have an equal number of sedans and SUVs in the fleet, but with a different total number of cars.\n\nIn that case, let\u2019s say the company wants to have N sedans and N SUVs, totaling 2N cars.\n\nCurrently, they have 72 sedans and 48 SUVs, totaling 120 cars.\n\nTo reach N sedans and N SUVs, they need to purchase additional sedans and SUVs.\n\nThe number of additional sedans needed would be N - 72, and the number of additional SUVs needed would be N - 48.\n\nThe total additional cars purchased would be (N - 72) + (N - 48) = 2N - 120.\n\nBut the problem specifies purchasing only sedans, which contradicts this approach.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the problem is misstated or there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company wants to have a 1:1 ratio by only purchasing sedans, which may not be possible without reducing the number of SUVs or increasing both.\n\nGiven that purchasing a negative number of sedans doesn't make sense, it seems that the company cannot achieve a 1:1 ratio by only purchasing more sedans if they already have more sedans than SUVs.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information and the calculations, the company cannot achieve a 1:1 ratio of sedans to SUVs by purchasing more sedans; instead, they would need to either reduce the number of sedans or increase the number of SUVs accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the company does not need to purchase any more sedans to achieve a 1:1 ratio; in fact, they need to reduce the number of sedans or increase the number of SUVs.\n\nBut since the question specifically asks for how many more sedans to purchase, and purchasing more sedans wouldn't help achieve the 1:1 ratio, the answer is that it's not possible to achieve the 1:1 ratio by purchasing more sedans alone.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
