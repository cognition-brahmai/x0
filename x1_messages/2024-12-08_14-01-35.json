        "content": "Let's see here. There are 8 friends and the vacation house costs $1,200 for the weekend. They want to split the cost equally among themselves. So, to find out how much each friend needs to contribute, I think I need to divide the total cost by the number of friends.\n\nSo, that would be $1,200 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do the math: 1200 \u00f7 8.\n\nWell, 8 times 100 is 800, and 8 times 50 is 400, so 100 plus 50 is 150.\n\nSo, each friend would need to contribute $150.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\n8 times 150 is 1,200, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in smaller steps. Maybe break down the numbers.\n\n$1,200 divided by 8.\n\nFirst, I know that 8 times 100 is 800.\n\nSubtract 800 from 1,200, and you get 400.\n\nThen, 8 times 50 is 400.\n\nSo, 100 plus 50 is 150.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that $1,200 is the same as 12 hundreds.\n\nSo, 12 hundreds divided by 8 friends.\n\nEach friend would get 12 \u00f7 8 = 1.5 hundreds.\n\n1.5 hundreds is $150.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could use long division.\n\nDivide 1,200 by 8.\n\n8 goes into 12 one time, write 1, multiply by 8 gets 8, subtract gets 4.\n\nBring down 0, gets 40.\n\n8 goes into 40 five times, write 5, multiply by 8 gets 40, subtract gets 0.\n\nSo, 150.\n\nYes, all methods confirm that each friend needs to contribute $150.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
