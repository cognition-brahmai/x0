        "content": "Creating a simple command-line utility for file handling in C involves understanding file operations such as creating, writing, reading, and deleting files. Below is a step-by-step guide to implement such a utility.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Menu Driven Interface**: Create a menu that allows the user to choose between creating a new file, writing data into a file, reading data from a file, and deleting a file.\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - **Create a new file**: Use `fopen` with mode `\"w\"` to create a new file.\n   - **Write data into a file**: Open the file in append mode `\"a\"` or write mode `\"w\"` and write data.\n   - **Read data from a file**: Open the file in read mode `\"r\"` and read data.\n   - **Delete a file**: Use `remove` function to delete the file.\n3. **Error Handling**: Check for errors such as file not found, unable to open file, etc., and handle them appropriately.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid createFile(const char *filename) {\n    FILE *file = fopen(filename, \"w\");\n    if (file == NULL) {\n        printf(\"Unable to create file: %s\\n\", filename);\n        return;\n    }\n    printf(\"File created: %s\\n\", filename);\n    fclose(file);\n}\n\nvoid writeFile(const char *filename) {\n    char data[1000];\n    printf(\"Enter data to write into the file (press ENTER when done):\\n\");\n    fgets(data, sizeof(data), stdin);\n    \n    FILE *file = fopen(filename, \"a\");\n    if (file == NULL) {\n        printf(\"Unable to open file: %s\\n\", filename);\n        return;\n    }\n    fprintf(file, \"%s\", data);\n    printf(\"Data written to file: %s\\n\", filename);\n    fclose(file);\n}\n\nvoid readFile(const char *filename) {\n    FILE *file = fopen(filename, \"r\");\n    if (file == NULL) {\n        printf(\"Unable to open file: %s\\n\", filename);\n        return;\n    }\n    char ch;\n    printf(\"Contents of %s:\\n\", filename);\n    while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) {\n        printf(\"%c\", ch);\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n    fclose(file);\n}\n\nvoid deleteFile(const char *filename) {\n    if (remove(filename) == 0) {\n        printf(\"File deleted: %s\\n\", filename);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Unable to delete file: %s\\n\", filename);\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int choice;\n    char filename[100];\n\n    while (1) {\n        printf(\"\\nSimple File Handling Utility\\n\");\n        printf(\"1. Create a new file\\n\");\n        printf(\"2. Write data into a file\\n\");\n        printf(\"3. Read data from a file\\n\");\n        printf(\"4. Delete a file\\n\");\n        printf(\"5. Exit\\n\");\n        printf(\"Enter your choice: \");\n        scanf(\"%d\", &choice);\n        scanf(\"%*c\"); // Consume newline character\n\n        switch (choice) {\n            case 1:\n                printf(\"Enter filename to create: \");\n                fgets(filename, sizeof(filename), stdin);\n                filename[strcspn(filename, \"\\n\")] = 0; // Remove newline character\n                createFile(filename);\n                break;\n            case 2:\n                printf(\"Enter filename to write into: \");\n                fgets(filename, sizeof(filename), stdin);\n                filename[strcspn(filename, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n                writeFile(filename);\n                break;\n            case 3:\n                printf(\"Enter filename to read: \");\n                fgets(filename, sizeof(filename), stdin);\n                filename[strcspn(filename, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n                readFile(filename);\n                break;\n            case 4:\n                printf(\"Enter filename to delete: \");\n                fgets(filename, sizeof(filename), stdin);\n                filename[strcspn(filename, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n                deleteFile(filename);\n                break;\n            case 5:\n                exit(0);\n            default:\n                printf(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Menu Driven Interface**: The program presents a menu with options to create, write, read, delete files, or exit.\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - **Create a new file**: Uses `fopen` with mode `\"w\"` to create a new file.\n   - **Write data into a file**: Uses `fgets` to read input from the user and `fprintf` to write it into the file in append mode `\"a\"`.\n   - **Read data from a file**: Opens the file in read mode `\"r\"` and uses `fgetc` to read and print its contents.\n   - **Delete a file**: Uses the `remove` function to delete the specified file.\n3. **Error Handling**: Checks if file operations are successful and prints appropriate messages if they fail.\n\nThis utility provides a basic framework for file handling operations in C and can be extended with more features as needed."
