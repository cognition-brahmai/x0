        "content": "To find out what percentage of species are insects, we can use the following formula for percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nHere, the \"part\" is the number of insect species, which is approximately 950,000, and the \"whole\" is the total number of species on Earth, which is approximately 7.9 million.\n\nFirst, let's make sure both numbers are in the same unit. Since 7.9 million is 7,900,000, we can proceed.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage} = \\left( \\frac{950,000}{7,900,000} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{950,000}{7,900,000} = 0.11974683544303797\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.11974683544303797 \\times 100 = 11.974683544303797\\%\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\n\\[\n11.97\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, approximately 11.97% of the species on Earth are insects.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.97\\%} \\]"
