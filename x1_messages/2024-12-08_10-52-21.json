        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 people in the room initially. Half of them have blue eyes, so that's 5 people with blue eyes. The other half have green eyes, which is also 5 people.\n\nNow, three more people with blue eyes enter the room. So, the number of people with blue eyes increases to 5 + 3 = 8.\n\nThe number of people with green eyes remains the same, which is 5.\n\nSo, the ratio of people with blue eyes to those with green eyes is 8 to 5.\n\nI think that's the answer. But let me double-check.\n\nInitially:\n\n- Blue eyes: 5\n\n- Green eyes: 5\n\nAfter three more blue-eyed people enter:\n\n- Blue eyes: 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- Green eyes: 5\n\nSo, the ratio is 8:5.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8:5} \\]"
