        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangular prism. It says the length is 5 meters, the width is 3 meters, and the height is 2 meters. I need to find its surface area in square meters. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that a rectangular prism has six faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right. To find the surface area, I need to find the area of each of these faces and then add them all together.\n\nLet me sketch this out. If I have a rectangular prism with length 5m, width 3m, and height 2m, then:\n\n- The top and bottom faces would both have dimensions of length by width, so 5m by 3m.\n\n- The front and back faces would have dimensions of length by height, so 5m by 2m.\n\n- The left and right faces would have dimensions of width by height, so 3m by 2m.\n\nNow, the area of each face is just the product of its two dimensions. So:\n\n- Area of top face = 5m * 3m = 15 square meters\n\n- Area of bottom face = same as top, so another 15 square meters\n\n- Area of front face = 5m * 2m = 10 square meters\n\n- Area of back face = same as front, so another 10 square meters\n\n- Area of left face = 3m * 2m = 6 square meters\n\n- Area of right face = same as left, so another 6 square meters\n\nNow, to find the total surface area, I add all these areas together:\n\n15 + 15 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 6\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n15 + 15 = 30\n\n30 + 10 = 40\n\n40 + 10 = 50\n\n50 + 6 = 56\n\n56 + 6 = 62\n\nSo, the total surface area is 62 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there a formula I can use instead of adding all the faces separately? I think there is a general formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism. Let me see if I can recall it.\n\nI think the formula is: Surface Area = 2(lw + lh + wh), where l is length, w is width, and h is height.\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\nSurface Area = 2*(5*3 + 5*2 + 3*2) = 2*(15 + 10 + 6) = 2*31 = 62 square meters.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier by adding each face separately. Good, that makes sense.\n\nIs there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe I can visualize unfolding the prism into a net and then calculate the areas.\n\nIf I unfold the prism, I should get a flat layout consisting of six rectangles: two of 5m by 3m, two of 5m by 2m, and two of 3m by 2m. That's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the surface area as the sum of the areas of all the faces.\n\nWait, another thing I was thinking about is that for some 3D shapes, there are different formulas or methods to find surface area, especially if they're more complex. But for a rectangular prism, it's straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if I have the correct dimensions. Length is 5m, width is 3m, height is 2m. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlso, making sure I didn't miss any faces. Six faces in total, as mentioned earlier.\n\nAnother thing I was considering is whether there's a difference between lateral surface area and total surface area. I think lateral surface area refers to the sides excluding the top and bottom, but in this problem, it's asking for total surface area, so I need to include all six faces.\n\nSo, adding them up again: 15 + 15 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 6 = 62 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 2*(lw + lh + wh) = 2*(15 + 10 + 6) = 2*31 = 62 square meters.\n\nLooks consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{62} \\]"
