        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Go program that listens for HTTP requests and logs details about each request to a MongoDB database. I need to use environment variables for the MongoDB connection string and the listening port. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic HTTP server in Go that can handle incoming requests. Go has a built-in package for HTTP called `net/http`, which I'll use for this purpose. I'll need to define a handler function that processes each request and extracts the method, path, and headers.\n\nNext, I need to connect to a MongoDB database to store this log data. For interacting with MongoDB, I can use the official MongoDB Go driver, which is called `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo`. I'll need to establish a connection to the MongoDB instance using the connection string provided via an environment variable.\n\nI should also handle cases where the environment variables are not set or are invalid, perhaps by providing default values or exiting with an error message.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the program:\n\n1. Read environment variables for the MongoDB connection string and the listening port.\n\n2. Set up a connection to MongoDB using the connection string.\n\n3. Create a collection in the database where I'll store the logs.\n\n4. Define an HTTP handler that, for each request, extracts the method, path, and headers, and inserts this data into the MongoDB collection.\n\n5. Start the HTTP server to listen on the specified port.\n\nI need to make sure that the program handles errors gracefully, such as failing to connect to MongoDB or issues with the HTTP server.\n\nAlso, I should consider the security implications of logging headers, as some headers might contain sensitive information. But for the sake of this task, I'll assume that it's okay to log all headers.\n\nLet me sketch out some code snippets to see how this would look.\n\nFirst, importing the necessary packages:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"os\"\n\n\t\"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo\"\n\t\"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options\"\n\t\"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson\"\n)\n```\n\nNext, reading environment variables:\n\n```go\nmongoURI := os.Getenv(\"MONGO_URI\")\nif mongoURI == \"\" {\n\tlog.Fatal(\"MONGO_URI environment variable is not set.\")\n}\n\nport := os.Getenv(\"PORT\")\nif port == \"\" {\n\tport = \"8080\" // default port\n}\n```\n\nSetting up the MongoDB client and selecting the database and collection:\n\n```go\nclientOptions := options.Client().ApplyURI(mongoURI)\nclient, err := mongo.Connect(context.Background(), clientOptions)\nif err != nil {\n\tlog.Fatal(err)\n}\n\ndefer client.Disconnect(context.Background())\n\ncollection := client.Database(\"logdb\").Collection(\"httplogs\")\n```\n\nDefining the HTTP handler:\n\n```go\nfunc logHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tmethod := r.Method\n\tpath := r.URL.Path\n\theaders := r.Header\n\n\t// Create a document to insert into MongoDB\n\tdocument := bson.D{\n\t\t{\"method\", method},\n\t\t{\"path\", path},\n\t\t{\"headers\", headers},\n\t}\n\n\t// Insert the document into the collection\n\t_, err := collection.InsertOne(context.Background(), document)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Failed to insert log:\", err)\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Internal server error\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)\n\tw.Write([]byte(\"Logged successfully\"))\n}\n```\n\nFinally, starting the HTTP server:\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/log\", logHandler)\n\n\taddr := \":\" + port\n\tlog.Printf(\"Starting server on port %s\\n\", port)\n\terr := http.ListenAndServe(addr, nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWait a minute, I need to consider that HTTP headers are a map-like structure, and I need to figure out how to store them in MongoDB. The `http.Header` type is a map[string][]string, so I need to convert it to a format that BSON can handle, perhaps by iterating over the headers and storing them as a map of strings to strings or strings to arrays.\n\nLet me adjust the logHandler to handle headers properly:\n\n```go\nfunc logHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tmethod := r.Method\n\tpath := r.URL.Path\n\theaders := make(map[string]string)\n\tfor k, v := range r.Header {\n\t\theaders[k] = v[0] // assuming single value for simplicity\n\t}\n\n\t// Create a document to insert into MongoDB\n\tdocument := bson.D{\n\t\t{\"method\", method},\n\t\t{\"path\", path},\n\t\t{\"headers\", headers},\n\t}\n\n\t// Insert the document into the collection\n\tresult, err := collection.InsertOne(context.Background(), document)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Println(\"Failed to insert log:\", err)\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Internal server error\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tlog.Printf(\"Inserted document with ID: %v\\n\", result.InsertedID)\n\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)\n\tw.Write([]byte(\"Logged successfully\"))\n}\n```\n\nThis should work for most cases, but some headers can have multiple values. If I need to preserve that, I should store headers as a map of strings to arrays of strings.\n\nLet me adjust that:\n\n```go\nheaders := make(map[string][]string)\nfor k, v := range r.Header {\n\theaders[k] = v\n}\n\n// ...\n\n{\"headers\", headers},\n```\n\nThat's better. Now, I need to ensure that the MongoDB schema can handle this structure. Since MongoDB is schema-less, this should be fine.\n\nAlso, I should consider adding a timestamp to each log entry. I can include the current time in the document.\n\nLet's update the handler to include the timestamp:\n\n```go\nimport \"time\"\n\n// ...\n\ntimestamp := time.Now()\n\ndocument := bson.D{\n\t{\"timestamp\", timestamp},\n\t{\"method\", method},\n\t{\"path\", path},\n\t{\"headers\", headers},\n}\n```\n\nThis way, each log entry will have a timestamp, method, path, and headers.\n\nI should also think about error handling. For example, if the insert operation fails, I should log the error and return an appropriate HTTP response.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to handle different HTTP methods differently, but for now, I'll keep it simple and log all methods the same way.\n\nI should also consider rate limiting or throttling if the server is expected to handle a high volume of requests to prevent overwhelming the database.\n\nFor deployment, I need to make sure that the environment variables `MONGO_URI` and `PORT` are set appropriately.\n\nLet me test this locally. I'll set the environment variables and run the program.\n\nAssuming I have MongoDB running locally, I can set `MONGO_URI` to `\"mongodb://localhost:27017\"` and `PORT` to `\"8080\"`.\n\nThen, I can curl the `/log` endpoint:\n\n```sh\ncurl -H \"Custom-Header: test\" http://localhost:8080/log\n```\n\nI should see \"Logged successfully\" in the response and the log entry in the MongoDB collection.\n\nI'll check the MongoDB collection to verify that the data is being stored correctly.\n\n```sh\nmongo\n> use logdb\n> db.httplogs.find()\n```\n\nI should see the documents with the method, path, headers, and timestamp.\n\nLooks good so far. I might want to add more fields or modify the logging logic based on requirements, but for now, this seems to fulfill the task.\n\nI should also think about security considerations, such as preventing injection attacks or logging sensitive information. Since headers can contain sensitive data, I need to ensure that this program is used in a controlled environment.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider using logging libraries instead of printing to stdout, especially for a production-ready application.\n\nFinally, I should write some comments in the code for clarity and possibly add command-line flags as an alternative to environment variables, but for this task, environment variables should suffice.\n\nI think this covers the requirements. Now, I'll clean up the code, add comments, and make sure it's well-organized.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Go program that listens for incoming HTTP requests and logs the request method, path, and headers to a MongoDB database using environment variables for configuration, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Read Environment Variables:** Use `os.Getenv` to read the MongoDB connection string and the listening port from environment variables.\n2. **Connect to MongoDB:** Use the official MongoDB Go driver to connect to the database.\n3. **Define HTTP Handler:** Create an HTTP handler that extracts the request method, path, and headers, and inserts this data into the MongoDB collection.\n4. **Start HTTP Server:** Initialize an HTTP server that listens on the specified port and uses the defined handler.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo\"\n\t\"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options\"\n\t\"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Read environment variables\n\tmongoURI := os.Getenv(\"MONGO_URI\")\n\tif mongoURI == \"\" {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"MONGO_URI environment variable is not set.\")\n\t}\n\n\tport := os.Getenv(\"PORT\")\n\tif port == \"\" {\n\t\tport = \"8080\" // Default port\n\t}\n\n\t// Set up MongoDB client\n\tclientOptions := options.Client().ApplyURI(mongoURI)\n\tclient, err := mongo.Connect(context.Background(), clientOptions)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tdefer client.Disconnect(context.Background())\n\n\tcollection := client.Database(\"logdb\").Collection(\"httplogs\")\n\n\t// Define HTTP handler\n\tlogHandler := func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\t\tmethod := r.Method\n\t\tpath := r.URL.Path\n\t\theaders := make(map[string][]string)\n\t\tfor k, v := range r.Header {\n\t\t\theaders[k] = v\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Create log document\n\t\ttimestamp := time.Now()\n\t\tdocument := bson.D{\n\t\t\t{\"timestamp\", timestamp},\n\t\t\t{\"method\", method},\n\t\t\t{\"path\", path},\n\t\t\t{\"headers\", headers},\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Insert document into MongoDB\n\t\tresult, err := collection.InsertOne(context.Background(), document)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Failed to insert log:\", err)\n\t\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Internal server error\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"Inserted document with ID: %v\\n\", result.InsertedID)\n\t\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)\n\t\tw.Write([]byte(\"Logged successfully\"))\n\t}\n\n\t// Start HTTP server\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/log\", logHandler)\n\taddr := \":\" + port\n\tlog.Printf(\"Starting server on port %s\\n\", port)\n\terr = http.ListenAndServe(addr, nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Environment Variables:** The program reads the MongoDB connection string and the listening port from the `MONGO_URI` and `PORT` environment variables, respectively.\n2. **MongoDB Connection:** It connects to MongoDB using the provided connection string and selects the `httplogs` collection in the `logdb` database.\n3. **HTTP Handler:** The `logHandler` function extracts the HTTP method, path, and headers from each request and logs them to the MongoDB collection along with a timestamp.\n4. **HTTP Server:** The server listens on the specified port and uses the `logHandler` to handle requests to the `/log` endpoint.\n\nThis setup ensures that all incoming requests to the specified endpoint are logged with relevant details in a MongoDB database."
