        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If you invest $1000 in a savings account that earns 3% annual interest compounded yearly, how much money will be in the account after five years? And I need to provide step-by-step calculations. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what compound interest means. Compound interest is when the interest earned on an investment is added back to the principal, so that in the next period, interest is earned on the new total, which is the original principal plus the previously earned interest. It's like earning interest on interest, which can make the investment grow faster over time.\n\nIn this case, the interest is compounded yearly, which means that once a year, the interest is calculated based on the current amount in the account and then added to the account.\n\nSo, the formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- P = $1000\n\n- r = 3% per year = 0.03 (as a decimal)\n\n- n = 1 (since interest is compounded yearly)\n\n- t = 5 years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nA = 1000 * (1 + 0.03/1)^(1*5)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses first:\n\n1 + 0.03/1 = 1 + 0.03 = 1.03\n\nSo,\n\nA = 1000 * (1.03)^5\n\nNow, I need to calculate 1.03 raised to the power of 5. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 1.03^1:\n\n1.03^1 = 1.03\n\nThen, 1.03^2:\n\n1.03 * 1.03 = 1.0609\n\nNext, 1.03^3:\n\n1.0609 * 1.03 = 1.092727\n\nThen, 1.03^4:\n\n1.092727 * 1.03 \u2248 1.12550871\n\nFinally, 1.03^5:\n\n1.12550871 * 1.03 \u2248 1.1592729723\n\nSo, A \u2248 1000 * 1.1592729723 \u2248 1159.2729723\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, since we're dealing with money, that would be $1159.27.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest directly:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^t\n\nSince n = 1, the formula simplifies to this.\n\nSo,\n\nA = 1000 * (1 + 0.03)^5\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nJust to double-check, let's calculate it another way, step by step for each year.\n\nYear 0: $1000\n\nYear 1: $1000 + 3% of $1000 = $1000 + $30 = $1030\n\nYear 2: $1030 + 3% of $1030 = $1030 + $30.90 = $1060.90\n\nYear 3: $1060.90 + 3% of $1060.90 \u2248 $1060.90 + $31.827 \u2248 $1092.727\n\nYear 4: $1092.727 + 3% of $1092.727 \u2248 $1092.727 + $32.772 = $1125.499\n\nYear 5: $1125.499 + 3% of $1125.499 \u2248 $1125.499 + $33.765 = $1159.264\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, again, $1159.26.\n\nWait a second, in the first method, I got $1159.27, and in this step-by-step method, I got $1159.26. The difference is likely due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps.\n\nTo get a more accurate result, I can carry more decimal places in the calculations.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nYear 0: $1000.00\n\nYear 1: $1000.00 + (0.03 * $1000.00) = $1000.00 + $30.00 = $1030.00\n\nYear 2: $1030.00 + (0.03 * $1030.00) = $1030.00 + $30.90 = $1060.90\n\nYear 3: $1060.90 + (0.03 * $1060.90) = $1060.90 + $31.827 = $1092.727\n\nYear 4: $1092.727 + (0.03 * $1092.727) = $1092.727 + $32.77201 = $1125.49901\n\nYear 5: $1125.49901 + (0.03 * $1125.49901) = $1125.49901 + $33.76547 = $1159.26448\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, this is $1159.26.\n\nSo, the slight discrepancy is due to rounding in the intermediate steps. The more precise calculation gives $1159.26.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula method with more precision:\n\nA = 1000 * (1.03)^5\n\nCalculating 1.03^5 more accurately:\n\n1.03^1 = 1.030000\n\n1.03^2 = 1.060900\n\n1.03^3 = 1.092727\n\n1.03^4 = 1.12550861\n\n1.03^5 = 1.1592740763\n\nThen, A = 1000 * 1.1592740763 = 1159.2740763\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, again, $1159.27.\n\nSo, depending on how you round during the calculation, you might get either $1159.26 or $1159.27. Both are acceptable, but for consistency, it's better to carry more decimal places until the final step and then round.\n\nTherefore, the amount in the account after five years would be approximately $1159.27.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer to be rounded to the nearest dollar, it would be $1159.\n\nBut since it's money, it's more precise to keep it in cents.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the compound interest formula directly:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWith P = 1000, r = 0.03, n = 1, t = 5:\n\nA = 1000 * (1 + 0.03/1)^(1*5) = 1000 * (1.03)^5\n\nAs calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, some people might use the formula:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^t\n\nWhich is the same as above when n = 1.\n\nSo, A = 1000 * (1.03)^5\n\nNow, calculating 1.03 to the power of 5:\n\n1.03^1 = 1.030000\n\n1.03^2 = 1.060900\n\n1.03^3 = 1.092727\n\n1.03^4 = 1.12550861\n\n1.03^5 = 1.1592740763\n\nThen, A = 1000 * 1.1592740763 = 1159.2740763\n\nRounding to two decimal places, $1159.27.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a calculator, you can compute it directly.\n\nBut it's good to understand the step-by-step process.\n\nSo, after five years, the account will have approximately $1159.27.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if the interest was simple interest, not compound, the calculation would be different.\n\nSimple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, and the interest does not get added back to the principal.\n\nThe formula for simple interest is:\n\nA = P + (P * r * t)\n\nOr\n\nA = P(1 + rt)\n\nSo, for the same values:\n\nA = 1000 * (1 + 0.03 * 5) = 1000 * (1 + 0.15) = 1000 * 1.15 = $1150\n\nComparing that to the compound interest amount of $1159.27, you can see that compound interest earns more over time because interest is earned on previously accumulated interest.\n\nBut in this case, since the problem specifies compound interest, the answer is $1159.27.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1159.27} \\]"
