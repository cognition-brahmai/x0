        "content": "Sure! Implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes in Go is straightforward. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2. The numbers which remain unmarked at the end of the algorithm are the prime numbers.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Go:\n\n1. **Create a boolean slice to track prime status of numbers.**\n2. **Initialize all entries as true. A value in prime[i] will finally be false if i is Not a prime, else true.**\n3. **Start from the first prime number, which is 2, and mark all of its multiples as not prime.**\n4. **Move to the next unmarked number and repeat the process until you've processed all numbers up to the square root of the limit.**\n5. **Collect and print all numbers that remain marked as true.**\n\nLet's write the code step by step.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in Go for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit, follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Input Handling:** Read the input limit from the user.\n2. **Sieve Algorithm:**\n   - Create a boolean slice `isPrime` of size `limit + 1` and initialize all entries to `true`.\n   - Mark `isPrime[0]` and `isPrime[1]` as `false` since 0 and 1 are not primes.\n   - For each number `p` starting from 2 up to the square root of the limit:\n     - If `p` is still marked as `true`, it is a prime.\n     - Mark all multiples of `p` starting from `p*p` as `false`.\n3. **Collect Primes:** Collect all numbers marked as `true` in the `isPrime` slice.\n4. **Output the Primes:** Print the list of prime numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math\"\n)\n\nfunc sieveOfEratosthenes(limit int) []int {\n\tif limit < 2 {\n\t\treturn []int{}\n\t}\n\n\tisPrime := make([]bool, limit+1)\n\tfor i := 2; i <= limit; i++ {\n\t\tisPrime[i] = true\n\t}\n\n\tfor p := 2; float64(p) <= math.Sqrt(float64(limit)); p++ {\n\t\tif isPrime[p] {\n\t\t\tfor multiple := p * p; multiple <= limit; multiple += p {\n\t\t\t\tisPrime[multiple] = false\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar primes []int\n\tfor num, prime := range isPrime {\n\t\tif prime {\n\t\t\tprimes = append(primes, num)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn primes\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar limit int\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter the limit to find all primes less than or equal to: \")\n\tfmt.Scan(&limit)\n\n\tprimes := sieveOfEratosthenes(limit)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Prime numbers up to\", limit, \"are:\", primes)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling:** The program prompts the user to enter an integer limit and reads this input.\n2. **Sieve Algorithm:**\n   - A boolean slice `isPrime` is initialized to track the primality of each number up to the limit.\n   - Starting from 2, the algorithm marks multiples of each found prime as non-prime.\n3. **Collect Primes:** After processing, the slice `isPrime` contains `true` for prime numbers and `false` for non-primes. The primes are collected into a slice.\n4. **Output the Primes:** The list of prime numbers is printed.\n\nThis implementation efficiently finds all prime numbers up to the given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm."
