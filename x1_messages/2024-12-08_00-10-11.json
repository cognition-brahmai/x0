        "content": "Let's see. So, in this city, the population is divided into three groups: children, adults, and senior citizens. The percentages are 40% children, 35% adults, and 25% senior citizens. The total population is 240,000 people. I need to find out how many more adults there are than children.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many children and how many adults there are in the city. Then, I can subtract the number of children from the number of adults to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of children. Since children make up 40% of the population, I can find the number of children by calculating 40% of 240,000.\n\nTo calculate 40% of 240,000, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply:\n\n40% = 0.40\n\nSo, number of children = 0.40 \u00d7 240,000\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.40 \u00d7 240,000 = 96,000\n\nSo, there are 96,000 children in the city.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of adults. Adults make up 35% of the population, so I'll find 35% of 240,000.\n\n35% = 0.35\n\nNumber of adults = 0.35 \u00d7 240,000\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.35 \u00d7 240,000 = 84,000\n\nSo, there are 84,000 adults in the city.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many more adults there are than children. To do that, I'll subtract the number of children from the number of adults:\n\nNumber of adults - Number of children = 84,000 - 96,000\n\nWait a minute, that would give me a negative number. That can't be right because the question asks how many more adults there are than children, implying that there are more adults. But according to this calculation, there are fewer adults than children.\n\nLet me double-check the percentages to make sure I'm understanding the problem correctly. The problem says that 40% are children, 35% are adults, and 25% are senior citizens. Adding those up:\n\n40% + 35% + 25% = 100%\n\nThat checks out. So, according to the percentages, there are more children than adults, not the other way around. Maybe the question is worded differently than I expected.\n\nSo, if there are 96,000 children and 84,000 adults, then actually, there are fewer adults than children. The difference would be:\n\n96,000 - 84,000 = 12,000\n\nSo, there are 12,000 more children than adults. But the question asks for how many more adults there are than children, which in this case would be a negative number, but it's probably expecting the absolute difference.\n\nMaybe I should present it as there are 12,000 more children than adults, or equivalently, 12,000 fewer adults than children.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks \"how many more adults are there than children?\" If there are actually more children than adults, then the correct answer would be that there are fewer adults than children, or that the number of adults is less than the number of children by 12,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake, and the percentages should be such that there are more adults than children. But based on the given percentages, there are more children.\n\nLet me verify the calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst calculation: number of children = 40% of 240,000 = 0.40 \u00d7 240,000 = 96,000\n\nSecond calculation: number of adults = 35% of 240,000 = 0.35 \u00d7 240,000 = 84,000\n\nDifference: 96,000 - 84,000 = 12,000\n\nSo, there are 12,000 more children than adults.\n\nTherefore, the answer to \"how many more adults are there than children?\" is that there are actually 12,000 fewer adults than children.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is expecting the difference in numbers regardless of which group is larger, then the difference is 12,000.\n\nBut to answer the question as asked, \"how many more adults are there than children?\", the correct response is that there are 12,000 fewer adults than children, or that there are 12,000 more children than adults.\n\nI think that's the accurate conclusion based on the given data.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12000} \\]"
