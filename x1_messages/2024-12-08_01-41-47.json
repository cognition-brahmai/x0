        "content": "To determine how long it will take to fill the swimming pool, we need to divide the total volume of the pool by the rate at which the container is filled.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Filling rate: 12 liters per minute\n\n- Pool volume: 50,000 liters\n\nFirst, we calculate the time in minutes:\n\nTime (minutes) = Pool volume / Filling rate\n\nTime (minutes) = 50,000 liters / 12 liters per minute\n\nTime (minutes) = 4,166.666... minutes\n\nSince it's more practical to express this time in hours, we can convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\nTime (hours) = Time (minutes) / 60\n\nTime (hours) = 4,166.666... / 60\n\nTime (hours) \u2248 69.444 hours\n\nSo, it will take approximately 69.444 hours to fill the swimming pool.\n\nIf we want to express this in days, we can further divide by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):\n\nTime (days) = Time (hours) / 24\n\nTime (days) \u2248 69.444 / 24\n\nTime (days) \u2248 2.893 days\n\nTherefore, it will take roughly 2.893 days to fill the pool.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{69.444 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
