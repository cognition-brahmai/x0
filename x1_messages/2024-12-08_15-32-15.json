The expression is:\n\n(6 / 2) * (1 + 2)^2 - 3\n\nFirst, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate inside the first set of parentheses: (6 / 2)\n\n6 divided by 2 is 3.\n\n2. Calculate inside the second set of parentheses: (1 + 2)\n\n1 plus 2 is 3.\n\nNow the expression simplifies to:\n\n3 * 3^2 - 3\n\nNext, handle the exponent:\n\n3 squared (3^2) is 9.\n\nSo now it's:\n\n3 * 9 - 3\n\nThen, perform multiplication:\n\n3 multiplied by 9 is 27.\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n27 - 3\n\nFinally, perform subtraction:\n\n27 minus 3 is 24.\n\nSo, the final answer is 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
