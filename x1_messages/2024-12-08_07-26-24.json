        "content": "So I have this problem here: There's a basketball team with 12 players, and only 5 can play at any given time. The question is asking for how many different combinations of players can be on the court. Hmm, combinations, that sounds like a problem involving choosing items from a set without regard to the order. So, it's not about permutations where the order matters, but rather about combinations where only what's chosen counts, not the order.\n\nI remember that the formula for combinations is given by \"n choose k,\" which is denoted as C(n, k) or sometimes as nCk, and it's calculated as n! divided by k!(n - k)!, where \"!\" means factorial. So, in this case, n is 12 (the total number of players), and k is 5 (the number of players chosen to be on the court).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * (12 - 5)!)\n\nFirst, I need to calculate 12!, which is 12 factorial, meaning 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. But calculating such a large factorial can be time-consuming, and sometimes there are ways to simplify this before jumping into the calculations.\n\nWait a minute, the formula has 12! on the numerator and 5! and (12 - 5)! on the denominator. So, 12 - 5 is 7, so (12 - 5)! is 7!. So, the formula becomes:\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * 7!)\n\nI know that 12! is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!, so the 7! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out.\n\nLet me write that:\n\nC(12, 5) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!) / (5! \u00d7 7!))\n\nThe 7! in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so:\n\nC(12, 5) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / 5!\n\nNow, 5! is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 120.\n\nSo, C(12, 5) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / 120\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator:\n\n12 \u00d7 11 = 132\n\n132 \u00d7 10 = 1320\n\n1320 \u00d7 9 = 11880\n\n11880 \u00d7 8 = 95040\n\nSo, the numerator is 95040.\n\nNow, divide that by 120:\n\n95040 / 120 = 792\n\nSo, there are 792 different combinations of players that can be on the court.\n\nWait a second, is there another way to think about this to confirm? Maybe using the combination formula in a different way or checking if I made a calculation error.\n\nAlternatively, I know that C(n, k) is equal to C(n, n - k). So, C(12, 5) should be equal to C(12, 7). Let me check if that gives the same result.\n\nC(12, 7) = 12! / (7! * (12 - 7)!) = 12! / (7! * 5!)\n\nWait, that's the same as C(12, 5), which makes sense because choosing 5 players out of 12 is the same as choosing 7 players to leave out.\n\nSo, that confirms that my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could try calculating C(12, 5) using a different method, perhaps using Pascal's triangle, but that would be impractical for n=12, as it would require building a large part of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the multiplicative formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n \u00d7 (n - 1) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (n - k + 1) / k!\n\nWhich is essentially what I did earlier.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nC(12, 5) = 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 / 5!\n\nWhich is the same as what I calculated before.\n\nSo, again, that gives me 95040 / 120 = 792.\n\nAlright, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there any restriction on the players, like maybe some players can't play together or have to play together? The problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so I'm assuming it's a straightforward combination problem.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, which is why we're using combinations and not permutations. If the order mattered, perhaps because of positions, then it would be a different calculation.\n\nBut in basketball, the positions matter, but the problem is just asking about which players are on the court, not about their positions. So, combinations are appropriate here.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, if positions mattered, and there were specific positions to assign to each player, that would be a different problem.\n\nFor example, if we had to choose a starting lineup with specific positions: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center, then the order would matter, and it would be a permutation problem.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that, so I think combinations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, if positions don't matter and it's just about which 5 players are on the court, then combinations are appropriate.\n\nSo, my final answer is 792 different combinations.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, let me check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I think about it step by step:\n\nFirst, choose 1 player out of 12. There are 12 choices.\n\nThen, choose another player out of the remaining 11. Then another out of the remaining 10, and so on, until I've chosen 5 players.\n\nSo, that would be 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8.\n\nBut wait, that's the number of permutations, not combinations, because it takes into account the order in which players are chosen.\n\nSince the order doesn't matter, I need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 5 players, which is 5!.\n\nSo, again, that gives me (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8) / 5! = 95040 / 120 = 792.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the combination formula directly on a calculator or look up a combination table, but since I'm doing this manually, this seems sufficient.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 792 different combinations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{792} \\]"
