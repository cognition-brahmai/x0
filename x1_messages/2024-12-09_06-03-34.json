        "content": "So I've got this problem here about students playing football and basketball. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere are 30 students in total. Out of these, 18 play football, 20 play basketball, and 10 play both games. I need to find out how many students don't play either game.\n\nHmm, okay. This sounds like a problem that can be solved using sets or maybe a Venn diagram. I'm pretty familiar with Venn diagrams, so maybe I'll try that.\n\nSo, if I imagine two circles overlapping, one for football and one for basketball. The overlapping part is for students who play both sports.\n\nGiven that 18 play football, 20 play basketball, and 10 play both.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many students play at least one of the two sports.\n\nI recall that for two sets, the formula for the union of the sets is:\n\nNumber of students playing football or basketball = Number playing football + Number playing basketball - Number playing both.\n\nSo, that would be 18 + 20 - 10 = 28 students play at least one of the two sports.\n\nNow, since there are 30 students in total, the number of students who don't play either sport would be:\n\nTotal students - Students playing at least one sport = 30 - 28 = 2.\n\nSo, my answer is 2 students don't play either game.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way could be to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nSo, the total number of students playing at least one sport is equal to the sum of the students playing each sport minus the number playing both (to avoid double-counting).\n\nThat's exactly what I did earlier: 18 + 20 - 10 = 28.\n\nThen, subtracting that from the total number of students gives me 30 - 28 = 2.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of sets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- F as the set of students playing football.\n\n- B as the set of students playing basketball.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |F| = 18\n\n- |B| = 20\n\n- |F \u2229 B| = 10\n\nWe need to find the number of students who are not in F or B, which is the complement of F union B.\n\nSo, it's total students - |F \u222a B|.\n\nFrom the formula, |F \u222a B| = |F| + |B| - |F \u2229 B| = 18 + 20 - 10 = 28.\n\nTherefore, students not playing either sport are 30 - 28 = 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can verify this by considering only the students who play only football, only basketball, and both.\n\nStudents who play only football: 18 - 10 = 8.\n\nStudents who play only basketball: 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nStudents who play both: 10.\n\nSo, total students playing at least one sport: 8 + 10 + 10 = 28.\n\nAgain, total students not playing any sport: 30 - 28 = 2.\n\nHmm, this keeps confirming the same answer. I think it's solid.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that some students might play neither, and maybe some play other sports not mentioned? The problem says \"play football, play basketball, and play both games,\" so I think it's safe to assume that these are the only sports being considered here.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"play both games,\" which means football and basketball. So, no other sports are mentioned, and we're to find those who don't play either.\n\nI think my approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use a Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles overlapping.\n\nOne circle has 18 students for football, the other has 20 for basketball, and the overlap is 10 who play both.\n\nSo, the part of the football circle that doesn't overlap is 18 - 10 = 8.\n\nThe part of the basketball circle that doesn't overlap is 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nThen, the overlap is 10.\n\nSo, total students playing at least one sport is 8 + 10 + 10 = 28.\n\nTotal students not playing any sport is 30 - 28 = 2.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of error in the given numbers.\n\nTotal students is 30.\n\nStudents playing football: 18.\n\nStudents playing basketball: 20.\n\nStudents playing both: 10.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nWell, 10 students play both, so that's included in both the football and basketball counts.\n\nSo, the number of students playing only football is 18 - 10 = 8.\n\nOnly basketball is 20 - 10 = 10.\n\nBoth is 10.\n\nTotal playing at least one sport is 8 + 10 + 10 = 28.\n\nAgain, 30 - 28 = 2 students not playing any sport.\n\nI can't see any flaws in this logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using probabilities or some other method, but I think the set theory approach is the most straightforward and appropriate here.\n\nSo, my final answer is 2 students do not play either game.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
