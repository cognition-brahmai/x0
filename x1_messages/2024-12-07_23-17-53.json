        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a C# console application that fetches weather data from a public API and displays the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed for a city that the user inputs via the command line. I'm a bit excited about this because it's my first time working with APIs in C#, but also a bit nervous since I'm not entirely sure where to start.\n\nFirst things first, I need to find a public weather API that I can use. I've heard of OpenWeatherMap; is that a good one to use? I think I'll go with that for now. I'll need to sign up and get an API key. Let me quickly head over to their website and see what they offer.\n\nOkay, I've signed up for OpenWeatherMap and got my API key. Now, I need to figure out how to make HTTP requests in C# to fetch data from their API. I recall that in C#, we can use the HttpClient class for making HTTP requests. I should probably look up some documentation or tutorials on how to use HttpClient to make GET requests.\n\nLet me open Visual Studio and create a new console application project. I'll name it something like \"WeatherApp\" or something similar. Once the project is created, I need to write the code that will take a city name as a command line argument, construct the API URL with that city name and my API key, make the HTTP request, and then parse the JSON response to extract the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.\n\nWait a minute, how do I handle command line arguments in C#? I think in the Main method, I can access the args array, which contains the command line arguments. So, the user will provide the city name as an argument when running the program, like \"WeatherApp NewYork\". I need to make sure to handle cases where the user doesn't provide any arguments or provides multiple arguments.\n\nAlright, so in the Main method, I'll check if there's at least one argument present. If not, I'll prompt the user to enter a city name. If there are arguments, I'll concatenate them to form the city name, in case the city name has multiple words, like \"New York\".\n\nNext, I need to construct the API URL. From looking at the OpenWeatherMap documentation, they have an API endpoint for current weather data, which is something like \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}\". I need to replace {city name} with the user-provided city name and {API key} with my actual API key.\n\nI should also consider error handling, like what if the city name is invalid or the API is down? I need to make sure that my program doesn't crash in such scenarios but instead provides a user-friendly message.\n\nNow, making the HTTP request. I'll need to use the HttpClient class, which is part of the System.Net.Http namespace. I need to make sure to include that namespace at the top of my code file.\n\nOnce I have the HttpClient instance, I can use its GetAsync method to make a GET request to the API URL. The response will be in JSON format, so I need to read the response content and parse the JSON to extract the required data.\n\nI've heard about Newtonsoft.Json, also known as Json.NET, which is a popular JSON parsing library for C#. Maybe I can use that to parse the JSON response. I need to add the Newtonsoft.Json package to my project. I think in Visual Studio, I can use NuGet package manager to install it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the built-in JSON parsing capabilities in .NET, like the System.Text.Json namespace, which was introduced in .NET Core 3.0. Since I'm using .NET Core, I can probably use that instead of Newtonsoft.Json.\n\nLet me see which one is better to use. Newtonsoft.Json is more feature-rich and has been around for a longer time, but System.Text.Json is faster and more lightweight. For a simple console application like this, System.Text.Json should suffice.\n\nSo, I'll use System.Text.Json for parsing the JSON response.\n\nNow, I need to define classes that match the structure of the JSON response, so that I can deserialize the JSON into C# objects. Alternatively, I can use dynamic typing to access the JSON properties without defining classes, but I think defining classes is a better approach for clarity and type safety.\n\nLooking at the JSON response from OpenWeatherMap's current weather API, it seems to have a structure like this:\n\n{\n\n\"coord\": { \"lon\": ..., \"lat\": ... },\n\n\"weather\": [{ \"id\": ..., \"main\": ..., \"description\": ..., \"icon\": ... }, ...],\n\n\"base\": \"...\",\n\n\"main\": {\n\n\"temp\": ...,\n\n\"feels_like\": ...,\n\n\"temp_min\": ...,\n\n\"temp_max\": ...,\n\n\"pressure\": ...,\n\n\"humidity\": ...\n\n},\n\n\"visibility\": ...,\n\n\"wind\": {\n\n\"speed\": ...,\n\n\"deg\": ...\n\n},\n\n\"clouds\": {\n\n\"all\": ...\n\n},\n\n\"dt\": ...,\n\n\"sys\": {\n\n\"type\": ...,\n\n\"id\": ...,\n\n\"country\": ...,\n\n\"sunrise\": ...,\n\n\"sunset\": ...\n\n},\n\n\"timezone\": ...,\n\n\"id\": ...,\n\n\"name\": ...,\n\n\"cod\": ...\n\n}\n\nFrom this, I need to extract the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. So, I'll need to map the \"main.temp\", \"main.humidity\", and \"wind.speed\" properties from the JSON to my C# objects.\n\nI should define classes that represent these parts of the JSON. Maybe something like:\n\npublic class WeatherResponse\n\n{\n\npublic Main Main { get; set; }\n\npublic Wind Wind { get; set; }\n\n// Other properties can be ignored for now\n\n}\n\npublic class Main\n\n{\n\npublic double Temp { get; set; }\n\npublic int Humidity { get; set; }\n\n}\n\npublic class Wind\n\n{\n\npublic double Speed { get; set; }\n\n}\n\nThat should suffice for now.\n\nOnce I have these classes, I can deserialize the JSON response into an instance of WeatherResponse, and then access the Temp, Humidity, and Speed properties from there.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON property names match the C# property names, or use the JsonProperty attribute to map them if necessary.\n\nWait, in the JSON, the \"main\" object has properties like \"temp\", \"humidity\", etc., and \"wind\" has \"speed\". So, in my C# classes, I've defined properties with the same names, so they should map automatically.\n\nNow, putting it all together, here's a rough outline of what the code might look like:\n\nusing System;\n\nusing System.Net.Http;\n\nusing System.Text.Json;\n\nclass Program\n\n{\n\nstatic async Task Main(string[] args)\n\n{\n\nif (args.Length == 0)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Please provide a city name as a command line argument.\");\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nstring cityName = string.Join(\" \", args);\n\nstring apiKey = \"your_api_key_here\";\n\nstring apiUrl = $\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={cityName}&appid={apiKey}\";\n\nusing (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())\n\n{\n\ntry\n\n{\n\nHttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(apiUrl);\n\nif (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)\n\n{\n\nstring json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n\nWeatherResponse weatherData = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<WeatherResponse>(json);\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Temperature: {weatherData.Main.Temp} K\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Humidity: {weatherData.Main.Humidity}%\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Wind Speed: {weatherData.Wind.Speed} m/s\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Error: {response.StatusCode}\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\ncatch (Exception ex)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"An error occurred: {ex.Message}\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\npublic class WeatherResponse\n\n{\n\npublic Main Main { get; set; }\n\npublic Wind Wind { get; set; }\n\n}\n\npublic class Main\n\n{\n\npublic double Temp { get; set; }\n\npublic int Humidity { get; set; }\n\n}\n\npublic class Wind\n\n{\n\npublic double Speed { get; set; }\n\n}\n\nI think this is a good starting point. I need to replace \"your_api_key_here\" with my actual API key, which I've obtained from OpenWeatherMap.\n\nAlso, I should consider handling cases where the city name is invalid, which would likely result in a specific error response from the API. I should check the JSON response for any error messages and display them to the user.\n\nMoreover, the temperature is given in Kelvin by default from OpenWeatherMap. Maybe I should convert it to Celsius or Fahrenheit for better readability. Let me check the API documentation to see if there's a way to specify the temperature unit.\n\nLooking at the OpenWeatherMap API documentation, there's a parameter called \"units\" that can be set to \"metric\" for Celsius, \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit, or \"standard\" for Kelvin. I think most people are more familiar with Celsius or Fahrenheit, so I'll set the units to \"metric\" to get the temperature in Celsius.\n\nSo, I need to update the API URL to include the units parameter:\n\nstring apiUrl = $\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={cityName}&appid={apiKey}&units=metric\";\n\nNow, the temperature should be in Celsius.\n\nAlso, I should handle cases where the API returns an error, such as \"City not found\". The API probably returns a JSON with an \"error\" key or something similar. I need to check the documentation for the possible error responses.\n\nAccording to the documentation, if the city is not found, the API returns a JSON like:\n\n{\n\n\"cod\": \"404\",\n\n\"message\": \"city not found\"\n\n}\n\nSo, in my code, I can check the \"cod\" property in the JSON response. If it's \"404\", I can display an error message to the user.\n\nI'll need to adjust my WeatherResponse class to include the \"cod\" property, or handle it separately.\n\nMaybe I should first check the response status code. If it's not successful (i.e., not in the 200-299 range), I can consider it an error and display the error message.\n\nBut, sometimes, even if the HTTP status code is 200, the API might return an error in the JSON payload, like the \"cod\": \"404\" example. So, I need to handle both cases.\n\nPerhaps I can modify my code to first check the HTTP status code, and if it's not successful, display the status code. If it's successful, then parse the JSON and check the \"cod\" property.\n\nSomething like:\n\nif (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)\n\n{\n\nstring json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n\nWeatherResponse weatherData = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<WeatherResponse>(json);\n\nif (weatherData != null && weatherData.Code == 200)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Temperature: {weatherData.Main.Temp}\u00b0C\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Humidity: {weatherData.Main.Humidity}%\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Wind Speed: {weatherData.Wind.Speed} m/s\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Error in API response.\");\n}\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"HTTP Error: {response.StatusCode}\");\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the JSON response, the \"cod\" property is likely a string, not an integer. I need to check the data type.\n\nLooking back at the error example, \"cod\": \"404\", so it's a string.\n\nSo, in my WeatherResponse class, I should have:\n\npublic class WeatherResponse\n\n{\n\npublic Main Main { get; set; }\n\npublic Wind Wind { get; set; }\n\npublic string Cod { get; set; }\n\n}\n\nThen, after deserializing the JSON, I can check the value of Cod. If it's \"404\", I can display an error message.\n\nSo, the updated code would look like:\n\nif (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)\n\n{\n\nstring json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n\nWeatherResponse weatherData = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<WeatherResponse>(json);\n\nif (weatherData != null && weatherData.Cod == \"200\")\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Temperature: {weatherData.Main.Temp}\u00b0C\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Humidity: {weatherData.Main.Humidity}%\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Wind Speed: {weatherData.Wind.Speed} m/s\");\n\n}\n\nelse if (weatherData != null && weatherData.Cod == \"404\")\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"City not found.\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"An error occurred while processing the request.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"HTTP Error: {response.StatusCode}\");\n\n}\n\nThis should cover most of the error scenarios.\n\nAlso, I should make sure to handle cases where the JSON parsing fails, perhaps due to network issues or an invalid response from the API. I can wrap the parsing code in a try-catch block to catch any JsonException or other exceptions that might occur.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider sanitizing the city name to prevent any injection attacks or invalid characters in the API request. However, since this is a console application and the input is limited to command line arguments, the risk is\u8f83\u4f4e, but it's still good practice to sanitize the input.\n\nI can use the Uri.EscapeDataString method to encode the city name in the API URL, which should handle any special characters in the city name.\n\nSo, instead of directly concatenating the city name into the API URL, I can do:\n\nstring encodedCityName = Uri.EscapeDataString(cityName);\n\nstring apiUrl = $\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={encodedCityName}&appid={apiKey}&units=metric\";\n\nThis should ensure that the city name is properly URL-encoded.\n\nMoreover, I should consider adding some user feedback while the program is fetching the weather data, like displaying a message saying \"Fetching weather data...\" to let the user know that something is happening.\n\nAlso, after displaying the weather data, I can prompt the user to press any key to exit, to prevent the console window from closing immediately.\n\nNow, let me think about how to structure the code. Since this is a simple console application, having all the code in the Main method should be fine for now. But, if the code grows larger, I might consider refactoring it into separate methods for better readability and maintainability.\n\nFor example, I can have a separate method to make the API request and return the WeatherResponse object, and another method to display the weather data.\n\nThis would make the code cleaner and easier to test.\n\nSo, perhaps I can define a method like:\n\nstatic async Task<WeatherResponse> GetWeatherDataAsync(string cityName, string apiKey)\n\n{\n\nstring encodedCityName = Uri.EscapeDataString(cityName);\n\nstring apiUrl = $\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={encodedCityName}&appid={apiKey}&units=metric\";\n\nusing (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())\n\n{\n\ntry\n\n{\n\nHttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(apiUrl);\n\nif (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)\n\n{\n\nstring json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n\nreturn JsonSerializer.Deserialize<WeatherResponse>(json);\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nreturn null;\n\n}\n\n}\n\ncatch (Exception)\n\n{\n\nreturn null;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThen, in the Main method, I can call this method and handle the response accordingly.\n\nThis way, the code is more modular and easier to manage.\n\nI should also define the WeatherResponse class with all the necessary properties, including Cod, Main, and Wind.\n\npublic class WeatherResponse\n\n{\n\npublic Main Main { get; set; }\n\npublic Wind Wind { get; set; }\n\npublic string Cod { get; set; }\n\n}\n\npublic class Main\n\n{\n\npublic double Temp { get; set; }\n\npublic int Humidity { get; set; }\n\n}\n\npublic class Wind\n\n{\n\npublic double Speed { get; set; }\n\n}\n\nNow, in the Main method, I can do something like:\n\nstring apiKey = \"your_api_key_here\";\n\nif (args.Length == 0)\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Please provide a city name as a command line argument.\");\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nstring cityName = string.Join(\" \", args);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Fetching weather data... Please wait.\");\n\nWeatherResponse weatherData = await GetWeatherDataAsync(cityName, apiKey);\n\nif (weatherData != null && weatherData.Cod == \"200\")\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Temperature: {weatherData.Main.Temp}\u00b0C\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Humidity: {weatherData.Main.Humidity}%\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Wind Speed: {weatherData.Wind.Speed} m/s\");\n\n}\n\nelse if (weatherData != null && weatherData.Cod == \"404\")\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"City not found.\");\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Failed to retrieve weather data. Please check your input or try again later.\");\n\n}\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit.\");\n\nConsole.ReadKey();\n\nThis seems more organized. Now, I need to make sure to handle any potential exceptions that might occur during the HTTP request or JSON parsing.\n\nIn the GetWeatherDataAsync method, I've already included a try-catch block that returns null in case of an exception. This is okay for now, but maybe I should consider logging the exception or handling it differently.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure that the HttpClient is properly disposed of after use, which is already handled by the using statement.\n\nAnother thing to consider is rate limiting with the API. OpenWeatherMap probably has rate limits on their free tier, so I should be aware of that and handle cases where the rate limit is exceeded.\n\nLooking at the OpenWeatherMap API documentation, their free tier allows 60 calls per minute, which should be sufficient for a simple console application.\n\nBut, to be safe, I can include error handling for rate limiting, although it's less likely to be an issue in this context.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the API key is kept secret and not hardcoded in the source code, especially if I plan to share or publish the code. But since this is a local console application, and I'm just learning, it's probably fine for now.\n\nHowever, as a best practice, I can consider reading the API key from an environment variable or a config file, but that might be overkill for this simple application.\n\nMoving forward, I should test the application with valid and invalid city names to ensure that it handles both cases correctly.\n\nFor example, running the program with \"London\" should display the weather data for London, while running it with \"abcdefgh\" should display \"City not found.\"\n\nI should also test it without any command line arguments to verify that it prompts the user correctly.\n\nWait a second, in my current implementation, if there are no arguments, I prompt the user to provide a city name, but actually, in the code I wrote earlier, I'm just printing a message and returning. I think I need to improve that.\n\nPerhaps I can modify the code to accept input from the user if no command line arguments are provided.\n\nSomething like:\n\nif (args.Length == 0)\n\n{\n\nConsole.Write(\"Please enter a city name: \");\n\nstring cityName = Console.ReadLine();\n\n// proceed with fetching weather data\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nstring cityName = string.Join(\" \", args);\n\n// proceed with fetching weather data\n\n}\n\nThis way, the user can either provide the city name as a command line argument or enter it manually when prompted.\n\nThat's better.\n\nAlso, I should consider trimming any leading or trailing whitespace from the city name to ensure consistency in the API request.\n\nSo, I can do:\n\nstring cityName = args.Length > 0 ? string.Join(\" \", args).Trim() : Console.ReadLine().Trim();\n\nThis should handle any extra spaces the user might accidentally include.\n\nFurthermore, I can add a check to make sure that the city name is not empty before making the API request.\n\nif (string.IsNullOrEmpty(cityName))\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"City name cannot be empty.\");\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nThis prevents unnecessary API calls.\n\nNow, regarding the temperature unit, I've set it to \"metric\" for Celsius. But maybe I can allow the user to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit.\n\nI can add an additional command line argument for the unit, like \"WeatherApp London c\" for Celsius or \"WeatherApp London f\" for Fahrenheit.\n\nTo implement this, I need to check if there's a second argument provided, and based on its value, set the \"units\" parameter accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n\nstring unit = \"metric\"; // default to Celsius\n\nif (args.Length >= 2)\n\n{\n\nstring unitArg = args[args.Length - 1].ToLower();\n\nif (unitArg == \"f\" || unitArg == \"imperial\")\n\n{\n\nunit = \"imperial\";\n\n}\n\nelse if (unitArg == \"c\" || unitArg == \"metric\")\n\n{\n\nunit = \"metric\";\n\n}\n\nelse\n\n{\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Invalid unit specified. Using default: Celsius.\");\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThen, construct the API URL with the selected unit.\n\nThis adds some flexibility to the application.\n\nI should also update the temperature unit in the output message, like \"Temperature: 20\u00b0C\" or \"Temperature: 68\u00b0F\", depending on the selected unit.\n\nSo, in the output statement, I can do:\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Temperature: {weatherData.Main.Temp}\u00b0{unit == \"metric\" ? \"C\" : \"F\"}\");\n\nThis dynamically sets the degree symbol followed by \"C\" or \"F\" based on the unit.\n\nThat's a nice touch.\n\nMoreover, I can enhance the user interface by formatting the output in a more readable way, perhaps aligning the labels and values.\n\nFor example:\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Weather Report:\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"--------------\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Temperature: {weatherData.Main.Temp}\u00b0{unit == \"metric\" ? \"C\" : \"F\"}\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Humidity: {weatherData.Main.Humidity}%\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Wind Speed: {weatherData.Wind.Speed} m/s\");\n\nThis makes the output look cleaner.\n\nI can also add some color to the console output to make it more visually appealing, but that might be optional.\n\nNow, let's think about error handling in more detail.\n\nIn the GetWeatherDataAsync method, I'm returning null in case of an exception or non-success HTTP status code.\n\nBut, perhaps I should consider propagating the exception to the caller, so that they can decide how to handle it.\n\nAlternatively, I can define a custom response class that includes both the weather data and any error messages.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, returning null and handling it in the Main method should suffice.\n\nBut, to make it more robust, I can log the exception details for debugging purposes, while still showing a user-friendly message.\n\nSince this is a console application, I can write the exception message to the console in debug mode, but hide it in release mode.\n\nAlternatively, I can use logging frameworks like NLog or log4net, but that might be overkill for this small project.\n\nI'll stick with writing to the console for now.\n\nAnother consideration is handling multiple weather data entries, but since the API returns data for a single city, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that all necessary namespaces are included at the beginning of the code file.\n\nFor example:\n\nusing System;\n\nusing System.Net.Http;\n\nusing System.Text.Json;\n\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\n\nI need to ensure that the project references the required assemblies, especially System.Net.Http and System.Text.Json.\n\nIn Visual Studio, these should be included by default in a .NET Core console application, but it's good to double-check.\n\nFurthermore, I need to make sure that the JSON properties match the C# property names exactly, or use the JsonProperty attribute to map them if needed.\n\nIn my earlier definition, I have:\n\npublic class Main\n\n{\n\npublic double Temp { get; set; }\n\npublic int Humidity { get; set; }\n\n}\n\nBut in the JSON response, the \"main\" object has \"temp\", \"humidity\", etc. Since the property names match, serialization should work fine.\n\nHowever, to make it more explicit, I can use the JsonProperty attribute from System.Text.Json.Serialization namespace.\n\nFor example:\n\nusing System.Text.Json.Serialization;\n\npublic class Main\n\n{\n\n[JsonPropertyName(\"temp\")]\n\npublic double Temp { get; set; }\n\n[JsonPropertyName(\"humidity\")]\n\npublic int Humidity { get; set; }\n\n}\n\nSimilarly for the Wind class:\n\npublic class Wind\n\n{\n\n[JsonPropertyName(\"speed\")]\n\npublic double Speed { get; set; }\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that the JSON property names are correctly mapped to the C# properties, even if the names don't match by convention.\n\nBut, in this case, since they do match, it's optional.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing some kind of caching mechanism to avoid hitting the API rate limits, especially if the user requests the same city multiple times in a short period.\n\nHowever, for a simple console application, and considering the low frequency of usage, caching might be overkill.\n\nBut, if I were to implement caching, I could store the weather data in memory with a timestamp, and only make a new API request if the cached data is older than a certain threshold, say 30 minutes.\n\nThis would require adding more complexity to the code, which might not be necessary for this basic implementation.\n\nI'll leave caching out for now, but it's good to keep in mind for more advanced scenarios.\n\nAnother enhancement could be to display more weather details, like description, pressure, visibility, etc., but for the scope of this task, temperature, humidity, and wind speed should suffice.\n\nAlso, I should consider localizing the output, especially the temperature unit, based on the user's location or preferences.\n\nBut, again, that might be beyond the scope of this project.\n\nNow, I need to test the application thoroughly.\n\nFirst, I'll compile the code to make sure there are no syntax errors or compilation issues.\n\nThen, I'll run the application with a valid city name and verify that the temperature, humidity, and wind speed are displayed correctly.\n\nNext, I'll test it with an invalid city name to ensure that the error message is displayed appropriately.\n\nI'll also test it without any command line arguments to confirm that it prompts the user to enter a city name.\n\nAdditionally, I'll test it with multiple command line arguments, including the unit specification, to make sure that it handles them correctly.\n\nFor example:\n\n- WeatherApp London\n\n- WeatherApp London c\n\n- WeatherApp London f\n\n- WeatherApp \"New York\"\n\n- WeatherApp abcdefgh\n\n- WeatherApp\n\nI need to make sure that the application behaves as expected in all these scenarios.\n\nIf everything works as planned, then I can consider the task complete.\n\nHowever, if I encounter any issues during testing, I'll need to debug the code, fix the bugs, and retest until it works correctly.\n\nDebugging might involve adding print statements or using the debugger in Visual Studio to step through the code and inspect variable values.\n\nI should also verify that the temperature unit is correctly displayed based on the user's choice, whether it's Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n\nLastly, I need to make sure that the API key is kept secure and not exposed in any logs or outputs.\n\nSince it's a console application and the API key is hardcoded, it's not a major concern, but it's good to be aware of security best practices.\n\nIn a real-world application, I would store the API key in a secure configuration file or use environment variables.\n\nBut for this learning exercise, hardcoding it should be acceptable.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the necessary aspects for this task.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the actual code based on the plans I've outlined.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a C# console application that consumes a public weather API and displays the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed for a given city, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **API Key**: Sign up for an API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).\n2. **Development Environment**: Ensure you have Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code installed.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Net.Http;\nusing System.Text.Json;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\n\nnamespace WeatherApp\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        private static readonly string ApiKey = \"your_api_key_here\";\n\n        static async Task Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            string cityName = args.Length > 0 ? string.Join(\" \", args).Trim() : GetCityNameFromUser();\n            string unit = DetermineUnit(args);\n\n            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(cityName))\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"City name cannot be empty.\");\n                return;\n            }\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Fetching weather data...

Optionally, specify the unit (`c` for Celsius, `f` for Fahrenheit).\n3. **HTTP Request**: Uses `HttpClient` to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n4. **JSON Parsing**: Uses `System.Text.Json` to parse the JSON response and extract relevant weather data.\n5. **Error Handling**: Handles cases where the city is not found or other errors occur during the API request.\n\nThis application provides a simple way to fetch and display current weather data for any given city, with options to specify temperature units."
