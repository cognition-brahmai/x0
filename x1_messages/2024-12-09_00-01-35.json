        "content": "Let's dive into this French grammar question. So, the subjunctive mood in French is used to express things like doubt, possibility, necessity, or actions that haven't happened yet. It's often used after words like \"que\" or \"qui\" when there's a verb or expression that shows doubt, wish, or emotion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand which sentences correctly use the subjunctive. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: \"Il est certain que tu aies raison.\"\n\nHere, \"il est certain\" means \"it is certain,\" which expresses certainty. According to the rule, the subjunctive is not used after expressions of certainty or belief. So, in this case, the indicative mood should be used instead of the subjunctive. That means it should be \"Il est certain que tu as raison.\" So, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: \"Je doute que tu sois malade.\"\n\n\"Douter\" means \"to doubt,\" which is an expression of doubt. So, according to the rule, the subjunctive should be used here. However, in this sentence, \"que\" is followed by the indicative \"sois.\" Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me check.\n\nActually, in French, after \"douter que,\" you use the subjunctive. So, it should be \"Je doute que tu sois malade.\" But wait, \"sois\" is the subjunctive form of \"\u00eatre.\" So, is \"sois\" indicative or subjunctive? Hmm.\n\nActually, \"sois\" is the subjunctive form of \"\u00eatre\" in the second person singular. So, if \"sois\" is subjunctive, then this sentence is correct. But I'm a bit confused because I thought after \"douter que,\" it's subjunctive, but \"sois\" is subjunctive. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.\n\nLet me double-check. \"Douter que\" + subjunctive. Yes, that's correct. So, \"Je doute que tu sois malade\" is correct because \"sois\" is the subjunctive form of \"\u00eatre.\" So, option B is correct.\n\nOption C: \"Je crois que tu es malade.\"\n\n\"Croire\" means \"to believe,\" and according to the rule, after expressions of certainty or belief, the indicative is used, not the subjunctive. So, in this case, \"es\" is the indicative form of \"\u00eatre,\" which is correct. If they had used the subjunctive, it would have been \"Je crois que tu sois malade,\" but that's incorrect. So, option C is correct as it stands, but the question is asking for the use of the subjunctive mood. So, even though this sentence is correct, it doesn't use the subjunctive; it uses the indicative. Therefore, it's not the answer we're looking for.\n\nOption D: \"Il est vrai que tu es malade.\"\n\n\"\tIl est vrai que\" means \"it is true that,\" which is an expression of certainty. So, similar to option A, the indicative should be used here, not the subjunctive. The sentence as given uses the indicative \"es,\" which is correct. So, option D is correct as it stands, but again, it doesn't use the subjunctive mood.\n\nWait a minute. The question is asking which of the following sentences correctly uses the French subjunctive mood. So, I need to find the sentence where the subjunctive is used appropriately.\n\nOption A uses the subjunctive but incorrectly, because it should use the indicative. Option B uses the subjunctive correctly. Option C and D use the indicative correctly, but they don't use the subjunctive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\nBut let me make sure. Is there any chance that option C could be using the subjunctive? No, because \"croire que\" takes the indicative, not the subjunctive.\n\nSimilarly, in option D, \"il est vrai que\" requires the indicative.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the subjunctive where it shouldn't.\n\nOnly option B correctly uses the subjunctive mood.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
