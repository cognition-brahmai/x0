        "content": "Let's see. I've got this election problem here. Candidate A got 55% of the votes, candidate B got 35%, and the rest were invalid. There were 20,000 valid votes cast. I need to find out how many invalid votes there were.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what percentage of the votes were invalid. Since candidate A had 55% and candidate B had 35%, together they account for 55% + 35% = 90% of the votes. That means the remaining 10% must be invalid votes.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the remaining votes were invalid, and that there were 20,000 valid votes cast. So, the valid votes are 90% of the total votes, and the invalid votes are 10% of the total votes.\n\nLet me denote the total number of votes as T. Then, the valid votes are 90% of T, which is equal to 20,000. So, 0.9T = 20,000.\n\nTo find T, I can divide both sides by 0.9: T = 20,000 / 0.9 = 22,222.222... Hmm, but the number of votes should be a whole number. Maybe I need to consider that the valid votes are exactly 90% of the total votes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid votes are 20,000, and invalid votes are some number I'll call I. So, total votes T = valid votes + invalid votes = 20,000 + I.\n\nBut I know that valid votes are 90% of total votes, so 20,000 = 0.9T.\n\nAgain, T = 20,000 / 0.9 = 22,222.222...\n\nWait, that can't be right because you can't have a fraction of a vote. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think differently. If there were 20,000 valid votes, and valid votes are 90% of the total votes, then invalid votes are 10% of the total votes.\n\nSo, invalid votes I = 0.1T.\n\nBut T = 20,000 / 0.9 = 22,222.222...\n\nSo, I = 0.1 * (20,000 / 0.9) = 2,222.222...\n\nAgain, fractional votes don't make sense. Maybe the problem expects me to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, T \u2248 22,222 votes in total.\n\nThen, invalid votes I \u2248 0.1 * 22,222 \u2248 2,222 votes.\n\nBut 0.1 * 22,222 = 2,222.2, which would round to 2,222 votes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total votes should be 22,222, and the valid votes are 20,000, so invalid votes are 2,222.\n\nBut let's check if 20,000 is exactly 90% of 22,222.\n\n22,222 * 0.9 = 19,999.8, which rounds to 20,000.\n\nSo, it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the number of invalid votes is approximately 2,222.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects an exact calculation without rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total votes are 22,222.222..., but since we can't have a fraction of a vote, maybe the total votes are 22,222, with 20,000 valid votes and 2,222 invalid votes.\n\nBut 22,222 * 0.9 = 19,999.8, which is not exactly 20,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total votes are 22,223.\n\n22,223 * 0.9 = 19,999.7, which rounds to 20,000.\n\n22,223 * 0.1 = 2,222.3, which rounds to 2,222 invalid votes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total votes are 22,222.\n\n22,222 * 0.9 = 19,999.8, which rounds to 20,000 valid votes.\n\n22,222 * 0.1 = 2,222.2, which rounds to 2,222 invalid votes.\n\nSo, in either case, it seems like there were approximately 2,222 invalid votes.\n\nPerhaps the exact number is 2,222.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nIf valid votes are 20,000, and they represent 90% of the total votes, then invalid votes represent 10% of the total votes.\n\nSo, invalid votes I = (10/90) * 20,000 = (1/9)*20,000 \u2248 2,222.222...\n\nAgain, rounding to the nearest whole number, I \u2248 2,222.\n\nTherefore, the number of invalid votes is 2,222.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2222} \\]"
