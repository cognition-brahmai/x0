This tool assists in finding suitable sites that may hold the answer to the user's question.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and generates plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkGatherer[input]: Extracts links from plain text and delivers a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nEinstein[input]: Question answering language model, especially effective in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that refers to an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the director of the movie \"Inception\" and what other movies has he directed?"
