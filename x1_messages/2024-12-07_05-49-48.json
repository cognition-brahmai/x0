It stars Jeff Bridges as the laid-back \"Dude,\" John Goodman as his friend Walter Sobchak, and Steve Buscemi as one of the many eccentric characters in the film. The movie is known for its unique blend of dark humor, crime elements, and a somewhat nonlinear plot that keeps viewers engaged and often confused in the best possible way."
