        "content": "So there are 10 cats in a room, and each cat has 4 legs and 2 eyes. The question is, how many legs do all the cats have together?\n\nAlright, let's think this through. If one cat has 4 legs, then for 10 cats, I would need to multiply the number of cats by the number of legs each cat has. So, that would be 10 cats times 4 legs per cat.\n\nLet me do the math: 10 multiplied by 4 is 40. So, there should be 40 legs in total.\n\nWait a minute, but just to make sure, maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe I can imagine lining up all the cats and counting their legs one by one. So, first cat: 4 legs, second cat: another 4, and so on, up to 10 cats.\n\nIf I add 4 legs ten times, that should still give me 40 legs.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in pairs. For example, two cats would have 8 legs, four cats would have 16 legs, and so on.\n\nLet me see: 2 cats = 8 legs\n\n4 cats = 16 legs\n\n6 cats = 24 legs\n\n8 cats = 32 legs\n\n10 cats = 40 legs\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if all cats have exactly 4 legs. Sometimes, cats might have disabilities or injuries that could result in fewer legs, but based on the problem, it states each cat has 4 legs, so I can assume all 10 cats have no disabilities.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that each cat has 2 eyes, but the question is only about legs, so the number of eyes isn't relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
