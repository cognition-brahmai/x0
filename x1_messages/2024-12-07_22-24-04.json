        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A group of people were asked if they prefer cats or dogs as pets. Out of those who answered, 40% said they prefer cats, and 60% said they prefer dogs. Also, it's given that 100 more people prefer dogs than cats. I need to find out how many people were surveyed in total.\n\nAlright, let's try to break this down. First, let's assume that the total number of people surveyed is X. Now, 40% of them prefer cats, which means 0.4X people prefer cats. Similarly, 60% prefer dogs, which is 0.6X people.\n\nThe problem also states that 100 more people prefer dogs than cats. So, the number of people who prefer dogs is equal to the number of people who prefer cats plus 100. In mathematical terms, that would be:\n\n0.6X = 0.4X + 100\n\nNow, I can solve for X. Subtracting 0.4X from both sides:\n\n0.6X - 0.4X = 100\n\n0.2X = 100\n\nNow, dividing both sides by 0.2:\n\nX = 100 / 0.2\n\nX = 500\n\nSo, the total number of people surveyed is 500.\n\nLet me just double-check this. If 40% of 500 prefer cats, that's 0.4 * 500 = 200 people. And 60% prefer dogs, which is 0.6 * 500 = 300 people. Now, 300 is indeed 100 more than 200. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me write it down.\n\nTotal people surveyed: 500"
