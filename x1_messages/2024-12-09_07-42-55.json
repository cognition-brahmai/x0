It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, text message, or direct message and tricks them into revealing sensitive information. Phishing attacks typically direct victims to a phishing website through a link in the message, which is designed to look like a legitimate site but is actually a fake one set up to steal information.\n\nPhishing attacks can take many forms and are not limited to emails; they can also occur via social media, instant messaging, and other communication channels. The goal is always to deceive the victim into providing valuable personal information that can be used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or financial fraud.\n\nIt's important to be cautious and verify the authenticity of any communication that asks for personal or financial information, especially if it comes unexpectedly or seems suspicious. Always ensure that you are on a legitimate website before entering any sensitive data, and be wary of any urgent or threatening language in messages that prompt you to act quickly."
