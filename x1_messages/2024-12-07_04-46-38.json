        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of 15 people, which includes five married couples and the rest are single. First, I need to figure out how many people are single.\n\nSince there are five married couples, that means there are 5 * 2 = 10 people who are part of these couples. So, out of the 15 people, 10 are married, and the remaining 15 - 10 = 5 people are single.\n\nNow, the problem states that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to find out how many handshakes occur between two single people.\n\nTo approach this, I think it would be helpful to calculate the total number of handshakes and then subtract the handshakes that don't involve two single people.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of handshakes in a group of 15 people where each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. The formula for the number of handshakes in a group of n people is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, total handshakes = C(15, 2) = 15 * 14 / 2 = 105.\n\nNow, I need to subtract the handshakes that are not between two single people. These would include:\n\n1. Handshakes between two married people (either both from the same couple or from different couples).\n\n2. Handshakes between a single person and a married person.\n\nFirst, let's consider the handshakes between married people.\n\nEach married couple shakes hands with each other, but since they are married, perhaps they don't shake hands, or maybe they do. Wait, the problem doesn't specify that married couples don't shake hands with each other. It just says that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, without any exceptions.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider that in some contexts, married couples don't shake hands in such settings, but the problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so I think I should assume that everyone shakes hands with everyone else, including married couples.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's re-read the problem: \"Each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.\" So, there are no restrictions; all handshakes occur.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes is indeed 105.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of handshakes between two single people.\n\nThere are 5 single people, so the number of handshakes between them is C(5, 2) = 5 * 4 / 2 = 10.\n\nWait, is that all? It seems too straightforward. Maybe I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me think again. Total handshakes: 105.\n\nHandshakes involving at least one married person:\n\n- Handshakes between a single and a married person.\n\n- Handshakes between two married people.\n\nBut actually, I think directly calculating the handshakes between two single people is simpler.\n\nSince there are 5 single people, the number of handshakes between them is indeed C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nTotal handshakes = handshakes between two single people + handshakes between a single and a married person + handshakes between two married people.\n\nBut since I'm only interested in handshakes between two single people, and I've directly calculated it as 10, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should verify this by calculating the other components as well.\n\nNumber of handshakes between a single and a married person:\n\nThere are 5 single people and 10 married people, so 5 * 10 = 50 handshakes.\n\nNumber of handshakes between two married people:\n\nThere are 10 married people, so C(10, 2) = 45 handshakes.\n\nBut wait, in the total handshakes, this includes handshakes between two married people, including those between married couples.\n\nBut again, since there are no restrictions, it's just C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n\nHandshakes between two single people: C(5, 2) = 10\n\nHandshakes between a single and a married person: 5 * 10 = 50\n\nHandshakes between two married people: C(10, 2) = 45\n\nTotal handshakes: 10 + 50 + 45 = 105, which matches the total handshakes calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the number of handshakes between two single people is indeed 10.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the single people only shake hands with each other in a subset of the total group.\n\nSo, yes, I think 10 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
