However, one author who is often cited for his profound influence is William Shakespeare. Shakespeare's works have shaped the English language, introduced complex characters and themes, and continue to be studied and performed worldwide. His contributions to drama, poetry, and literature as a whole are unparalleled, making him a strong candidate for the title of the most influential author in literature."
