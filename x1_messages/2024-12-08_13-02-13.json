        "content": "Reversing a singly linked list without using any additional data structures is a classic problem in computer science. In Go (Golang), you can achieve this by manipulating the pointers of the nodes in the list. Below is a step-by-step explanation and the corresponding code to reverse a singly linked list.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - We need three pointers to keep track of the nodes during the reversal process: `prev`, `current`, and `next`.\n   - Initialize `prev` to `nil` (since the new head will point to `nil`), `current` to the head of the list, and `next` to `nil`.\n\n2. **Traversal and Reversal**:\n   - Traverse the list, updating the pointers as follows:\n     - Before moving to the next node, store the next node in `next`.\n     - Reverse the link of the current node to point to `prev`.\n     - Move `prev` and `current` one step forward in the list.\n\n3. **Update Head**:\n   - After the traversal, the `prev` pointer will be at the new head of the reversed list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\n// Definition for singly-linked list.\ntype ListNode struct {\n Val int\n Next *ListNode\n}\n\nfunc reverseList(head *ListNode) *ListNode {\n\tvar prev *ListNode\n\tcurrent := head\n\tvar next *ListNode\n\n\tfor current != nil {\n\t\tnext = current.Next // Store next node\n\t\tcurrent.Next = prev // Reverse link\n\t\tprev = current      // Move prev forward\n\t\tcurrent = next      // Move current forward\n\t}\n\n\treturn prev // New head\n}\n\n// Helper function to print the list\nfunc printList(head *ListNode) {\n\tfor head != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%d -> \", head.Val)\n\t\thead = head.Next\n\t}\n\tfmt.Println(\"nil\")\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Creating a sample linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> nil\n\thead := &ListNode{1, &ListNode{2, &ListNode{3, &ListNode{4, &ListNode{5, nil}}}}}\n\n\tfmt.Println(\"Original list:\")\n\tprintList(head)\n\n\treversedHead := reverseList(head)\n\n\tfmt.Println(\"Reversed list:\")\n\tprintList(reversedHead)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `prev` is initialized to `nil` because the new head should point to `nil`.\n   - `current` starts at the head of the list.\n   - `next` is initialized to `nil` and is used to temporarily store the next node during traversal.\n\n2. **Traversal and Reversal**:\n   - In each iteration:\n     - `next` is set to `current.Next` to remember the next node before changing `current.Next`.\n     - `current.Next` is set to `prev` to reverse the link.\n     - `prev` is updated to `current`.\n     - `current` is moved to `next`.\n   \n3. **Update Head**:\n   - After the loop, `prev` points to the new head of the reversed list.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is reversed in-place without using any additional data structures, adhering to the constraints provided."
