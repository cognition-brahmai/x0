        "content": "Dear Ron,\n\nHope this finds you well, mate. I'm sitting here in my cupboard, trying to write you a postcard about my summer vacation. Can you believe it? Summer vacation with the Dursleys. Yeah, right.\n\nSo, as you know, I spent the summer at Privet Drive, stuck between Dudley's discarded socks and broken toys. The Dursleys haven't changed a bit. Uncle Vernon is still as grumpy as ever, and Aunt Petunia still cooks like her kitchen is on fire. Dudley, well, he's turned into a proper fatty. He's got this new video game console that he's glued to all day. I think he's trying to compete with me in the whole \"being a wizard\" department, but I don't think Tetris counts.\n\nThe only highlight was when Dudley's gang tried to jump me near the park. I managed to hex one of them so bad, his ears turned bright purple. It was worth the detention I got from Uncle Vernon. At least I had a good laugh.\n\nI did manage to sneak out once or twice. Flooed to Diagon Alley to get my school supplies. Caught up with Hermione there. She's as bushy-tailed as ever, but she filled me in on all the magical happenings I missed over the summer. Turns out, there's been some funny business going on at the Ministry. Some dark artifacts have been stolen, or so she says. I told her I'd keep an eye out.\n\nOtherwise, it's been pretty dull. I've been practicing some spells in secret. I think I've got the Patronus charm down, but it's still a bit shaky. Maybe you can help me perfect it when I get back to Hogwarts.\n\nSpeaking of which, I can't wait to see you again. Hogwarts feels like home, doesn't it? I miss the Gryffindor common room, Quidditch practice, and even Professor McGonagall's stern lectures.\n\nOh, and I heard from Fred and George that you've been helping out in the joke shop. How's that going? Any new inventions I should look out for?\n\nWell, I'd better wrap this up before Uncle Vernon wonders what I'm doing in here. Tell Mrs. Weasley hello, and give Pig a treat for me.\n\nSee you soon, mate.\n\nHarry"
