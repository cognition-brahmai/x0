        "content": "Let's see. I have a box with red, blue, and green balls. The probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, and the probability of picking a blue ball is 1/4. I need to find out the probability of picking a green ball.\n\nFirst, I know that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes should equal 1. In this case, the possible outcomes are picking a red, blue, or green ball. So, the probability of picking a red ball plus the probability of picking a blue ball plus the probability of picking a green ball should equal 1.\n\nMathematically, that is:\n\nP(red) + P(blue) + P(green) = 1\n\nI'm given that P(red) = 1/3 and P(blue) = 1/4. I need to find P(green).\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n1/3 + 1/4 + P(green) = 1\n\nTo add 1/3 and 1/4, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nConverting the fractions:\n\n1/3 = 4/12\n\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nSo, 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n7/12 + P(green) = 1\n\nTo find P(green), I subtract 7/12 from 1:\n\nP(green) = 1 - 7/12\n\n1 can be written as 12/12, so:\n\nP(green) = 12/12 - 7/12 = 5/12\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a green ball is 5/12.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nTotal probability should be 1.\n\nP(red) = 1/3 \u2248 0.333\n\nP(blue) = 1/4 = 0.25\n\nP(green) = 5/12 \u2248 0.4167\n\nAdding them up: 0.333 + 0.25 + 0.4167 \u2248 0.9997, which is very close to 1, considering floating-point arithmetic.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of actual numbers of balls to verify.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are 12 balls in total (since 12 is a common multiple of 3 and 4).\n\nIf the probability of picking a red ball is 1/3, then the number of red balls is (1/3)*12 = 4.\n\nThe probability of picking a blue ball is 1/4, so the number of blue balls is (1/4)*12 = 3.\n\nTotal balls are 12, so the number of green balls is 12 - 4 - 3 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a green ball is 5/12.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the probabilities directly without assuming a total number, the sum should still be 1.\n\nSo, P(green) = 1 - P(red) - P(blue) = 1 - 1/3 - 1/4.\n\nAs I did before, finding a common denominator, which is 12:\n\nP(green) = 1 - 4/12 - 3/12 = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the probabilities must sum to 1, and given two probabilities, the third can be found by subtraction.\n\nSo, in general, for three mutually exclusive and exhaustive events:\n\nP(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1\n\nGiven P(A) and P(B), P(C) = 1 - P(A) - P(B).\n\nIn this case, P(green) = 1 - P(red) - P(blue) = 1 - 1/3 - 1/4 = 5/12.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a green ball is 5/12.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}} \\]"
