BUS STOP - DAY\n\nThe bus stop is a simple shelter with a bench, located on a busy street in a small town. The sun is shining and there's a light breeze.\n\nTwo strangers, JAMES (mid-30s, wearing business attire) and LUCY (late 20s, dressed casually), sit on opposite ends of the bench waiting for their respective buses.

I've been waiting here for twenty minutes already.\n\nThey share a brief laugh, breaking the ice between them.\n\nJAMES\nI'm James, by the way.\n\nLUCY\nNice to meet you, James. I'm Lucy.\n\nJames notices a book sticking out of Lucy's bag - \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee.\n\nJAMES\n(pointing at the book)\nGreat book! It's one of my favorites.\n\nLUCY\n(surprised)\nReally? Mine too! I must have read it at least five times.\n\nJAMES\nSame here.

The view from the top is amazing!\n\nJAMES\n(nodding)\nYes! I try to go there at least once a year. Last time, I even camped overnight.\n\nLUCY\n(wistful)\nThat sounds wonderful.
