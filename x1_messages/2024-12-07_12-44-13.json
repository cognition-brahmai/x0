        "content": "So I've got this task: create a JavaScript function that takes two arrays of integers and returns their intersection without using any built-in or external libraries, and it should be efficient in terms of time complexity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an intersection means in this context. Intersection of two arrays means finding the common elements between them. So, if array A has [1, 2, 3, 4] and array B has [3, 4, 5, 6], the intersection should be [3, 4].\n\nNow, the tricky part is to do this efficiently without using built-in methods. In JavaScript, there are easy ways like using filter or set methods, but since I can't use those, I have to think of a manual approach.\n\nOne straightforward way is to loop through each element of the first array and check if it exists in the second array. If it does, add it to the result array. But this would be inefficient, especially if both arrays are large, because for each element in the first array, I'd be scanning the entire second array. That would be O(n*m) time complexity, where n and m are the lengths of the arrays. That's not great.\n\nI need a better way. Maybe I can sort both arrays first and then find the intersection. Sorting can be done in O(n log n) and O(m log m) time, and then finding the intersection of two sorted arrays can be done in O(n + m) time using two pointers. So overall, the time complexity would be O(n log n + m log m + n + m), which is better than the initial approach.\n\nBut the problem is, I can't use any built-in sort methods either, since I can't use any built-in or external libraries. So I have to implement my own sort function.\n\nImplementing a sort function from scratch isn't too hard, but I have to make sure it's efficient. Quick sort or merge sort would be good options, both have average time complexity of O(n log n).\n\nLet me think about merge sort, since it's stable and easy to implement recursively.\n\nFirst, I'll write a merge function that takes two sorted arrays and merges them into one sorted array.\n\nThen, the merge sort function will divide the array into halves, sort each half recursively, and then merge them using the merge function.\n\nOnce I have both arrays sorted, I can find the intersection efficiently.\n\nTo find the intersection of two sorted arrays, I can use two pointers starting from the beginning of each array. If the current elements of both pointers are equal, I add that element to the result and move both pointers forward. If the element in the first array is smaller, I move the pointer in the first array forward, and vice versa. This way, I traverse both arrays only once, which is O(n + m) time.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Implement a merge sort function.\n\n2. Sort both input arrays using the merge sort function.\n\n3. Use two pointers to find common elements in the sorted arrays.\n\n4. Return the array of common elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the function handles duplicates correctly. If there are duplicates in both arrays, the intersection should include the minimum number of occurrences in either array. For example, if array A has [1,2,2,3] and array B has [2,2,4], the intersection should be [2,2].\n\nAlso, the function should handle empty arrays gracefully, returning an empty array if there's no intersection or if any of the input arrays is empty.\n\nLet me consider some edge cases:\n\n- Both arrays are empty: should return an empty array.\n\n- One array is empty: should return an empty array.\n\n- No common elements: should return an empty array.\n\n- Arrays with duplicate elements: should include duplicates in the intersection if they occur in both arrays.\n\n- Arrays of different lengths.\n\nI should also consider that the arrays can contain negative integers, so the sorting function needs to handle negative numbers correctly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the problem asks for an array containing their intersection, but it doesn't specify the order of elements in the result array. So, as long as the elements are present, the order doesn't matter. But since I'm sorting the arrays, the result will be in sorted order, which is fine.\n\nLet me start by implementing the merge sort function.\n\nFirst, the merge function:\n\nfunction merge(left, right) {\n\nlet result = [];\n\nlet i = 0;\n\nlet j = 0;\n\nwhile (i < left.length && j < right.length) {\n\nif (left[i] < right[j]) {\n\nresult.push(left[i]);\n\ni++;\n\n} else {\n\nresult.push(right[j]);\n\nj++;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n// Add remaining elements of left, if any\n\nwhile (i < left.length) {\n\nresult.push(left[i]);\n\ni++;\n\n}\n\n// Add remaining elements of right, if any\n\nwhile (j < right.length) {\n\nresult.push(right[j]);\n\nj++;\n\n}\n\nreturn result;\n\n}\n\nThen, the merge sort function:\n\nfunction mergeSort(arr) {\n\nif (arr.length <= 1) {\n\nreturn arr;\n\n}\n\n// Find the middle index\n\nconst mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);\n\n// Recursively sort subarrays\n\nconst left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));\n\nconst right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));\n\n// Merge the sorted subarrays\n\nreturn merge(left, right);\n\n}\n\nNow, I need to sort both input arrays using mergeSort.\n\nAfter sorting, I'll implement the intersection logic using two pointers.\n\nLet me write a function for intersection:\n\nfunction arrayIntersection(arr1, arr2) {\n\n// Sort both arrays\n\nconst sortedA = mergeSort(arr1);\n\nconst sortedB = mergeSort(arr2);\n\n// Initialize pointers for both arrays\n\nlet i = 0;\n\nlet j = 0;\n\n// Array to store intersection\n\nconst intersection = [];\n\n// Traverse both arrays\n\nwhile (i < sortedA.length && j < sortedB.length) {\n\nif (sortedA[i] === sortedB[j]) {\n\n// Common element found\n\nintersection.push(sortedA[i]);\n\ni++;\n\nj++;\n\n} else if (sortedA[i] < sortedB[j]) {\n\ni++;\n\n} else {\n\nj++;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn intersection;\n\n}\n\nLet me test this function with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nconst A = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\nconst B = [3, 4, 5, 6];\n\nconsole.log(arrayIntersection(A, B)); // Should return [3,4]\n\nExample 2:\n\nconst A = [1,2,2,3];\n\nconst B = [2,2,4];\n\nconsole.log(arrayIntersection(A, B)); // Should return [2,2]\n\nExample 3:\n\nconst A = [];\n\nconst B = [1,2,3];\n\nconsole.log(arrayIntersection(A, B)); // Should return []\n\nExample 4:\n\nconst A = [1,3,5];\n\nconst B = [2,4,6];\n\nconsole.log(arrayIntersection(A, B)); // Should return []\n\nExample 5:\n\nconst A = [-1,0,1];\n\nconst B = [0,1,2];\n\nconsole.log(arrayIntersection(A, B)); // Should return [0,1]\n\nSeems like it should work correctly.\n\nNow, in terms of time complexity:\n\n- mergeSort has O(n log n) time complexity for each array.\n\n- The intersection finding step has O(n + m) time complexity.\n\nSo overall time complexity is O(n log n + m log m + n + m), which is efficient.\n\nSpace complexity is O(n + m) because of the sorted arrays and the result array.\n\nBut the problem asks for no built-in or external libraries, and I've implemented everything from scratch, so that should be fine.\n\nI think this is a solid solution.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the intersection of two arrays of integers without using any built-in or external libraries, and ensuring efficiency in terms of time complexity.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Understanding Intersection**: The intersection of two arrays consists of elements that are present in both arrays. We need to find these common elements efficiently.\n\n2. **Efficient Solution**:\n   - **Sorting**: Sort both input arrays. This allows us to efficiently find common elements.\n   - **Merging**: Use a two-pointer technique to traverse both sorted arrays simultaneously and collect common elements.\n\n3. **Custom Sort Function**: Since we cannot use built-in sort methods, we implement a custom merge sort algorithm.\n\n4. **Intersection Logic**: Using two pointers on the sorted arrays, we can traverse and find common elements in linear time.\n\n## Solution Code\n\n```javascript\nfunction merge(left, right) {\n    let result = [];\n    let i = 0;\n    let j = 0;\n    while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {\n        if (left[i] < right[j]) {\n            result.push(left[i]);\n            i++;\n        } else {\n            result.push(right[j]);\n            j++;\n        }\n    }\n    // Add remaining elements of left, if any\n    while (i < left.length) {\n        result.push(left[i]);\n        i++;\n    }\n    // Add remaining elements of right, if any\n    while (j < right.length) {\n        result.push(right[j]);\n        j++;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nfunction mergeSort(arr) {\n    if (arr.length <= 1) {\n        return arr;\n    }\n    // Find the middle index\n    const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);\n    // Recursively sort subarrays\n    const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));\n    const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));\n    // Merge the sorted subarrays\n    return merge(left, right);\n}\n\nfunction arrayIntersection(arr1, arr2) {\n    // Sort both arrays\n    const sortedA = mergeSort(arr1);\n    const sortedB = mergeSort(arr2);\n    // Initialize pointers for both arrays\n    let i = 0;\n    let j = 0;\n    // Array to store intersection\n    const intersection = [];\n    // Traverse both arrays\n    while (i < sortedA.length && j < sortedB.length) {\n        if (sortedA[i] === sortedB[j]) {\n            // Common element found\n            intersection.push(sortedA[i]);\n            i++;\n            j++;\n        } else if (sortedA[i] < sortedB[j]) {\n            i++;\n        } else {\n            j++;\n        }\n    }\n    return intersection;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst A = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconst B = [3, 4, 5, 6];\nconsole.log(arrayIntersection(A, B)); // Output: [3, 4]\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Merge Function**: Merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.\n2. **Merge Sort Function**: Recursively divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back using the merge function.\n3. **Intersection Function**:\n   - Sort both input arrays using the merge sort function.\n   - Use two pointers to traverse the sorted arrays and collect common elements.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency with a time complexity of O(n log n + m log m + n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays. The space complexity is O(n + m) due to the sorted arrays and the result array."
