        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that cranks out 1000 widgets every day. Each of these widgets goes through a quality check, and unfortunately, 5% of them don't make the cut and get rejected. We need to find out how many widgets pass this quality control and get packaged for sale each day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 5% rejection means. If 5% of the widgets are rejected, that means 95% are accepted, right? Because 100% minus 5% equals 95%. So, if I can calculate 95% of the total daily production, that should give me the number of widgets that are accepted and packaged.\n\nThe total daily production is 1000 widgets. So, to find 95% of 1000, I can multiply 1000 by 0.95. Let me do that:\n\n1000 \u00d7 0.95 = 950\n\nSo, 950 widgets are accepted each day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe I can calculate the number of rejected widgets first and then subtract that from the total production to get the accepted amount.\n\nIf 5% are rejected, then the number of rejected widgets is 5% of 1000. That would be:\n\n1000 \u00d7 0.05 = 50\n\nSo, 50 widgets are rejected. If I subtract that from the total production:\n\n1000 - 50 = 950\n\nAgain, I get 950 accepted widgets. That matches my first calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct number.\n\nLet me think if there's any other angle I should consider. Is there any possibility that the rejection rate varies or that some widgets are set aside for rework instead of being rejected outright? But based on the information provided, it seems straightforward: 5% rejection rate, meaning 95% acceptance rate.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that for every 100 widgets produced, 5 are rejected and 95 are accepted. Since the factory produces 1000 widgets, which is 10 times 100, the accepted widgets would be 10 times 95, which is again 950.\n\nThis consistency across different methods reinforces that 950 is the correct number of widgets accepted and packaged for sale daily.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any rounding involved. Since 1000 is a nice even number and 95% of 1000 is exactly 950, there's no need for rounding.\n\nSo, the final answer is 950 widgets are accepted and packaged for sale each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{950} \\]"
