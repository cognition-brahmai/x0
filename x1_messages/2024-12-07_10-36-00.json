        "content": "Ah, you're thinking about one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies. The play that features Macbeth and Lady Macbeth is called \"Macbeth.\" It's a story that delves deep into themes of ambition, power, and the consequences of unchecked desire. Macbeth is a general who receives a prophecy from three witches that he will become king of Scotland. Driven by ambition and urged on by his wife, Lady Macbeth, he commits regicide to seize the throne. The play explores the psychological and moral deterioration of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth as they grapple with the guilt and paranoia that follow their murderous acts. It's a compelling exploration of power's corrupting influence and the human capacity for evil."
