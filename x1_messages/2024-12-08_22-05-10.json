        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two factories, A and B, producing widgets with different daily outputs and defect rates. We need to find out how many defective widgets both factories produce combined in one week.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given:\n\n- Factory A produces 300 widgets per day with a 2% defect rate.\n\n- Factory B produces 500 widgets per day with a 1.5% defect rate.\n\n- We need to find the total number of defective widgets produced by both factories in one week.\n\nAssuming a week has 7 days, we can calculate the daily defective widgets for each factory and then multiply by 7 to get the weekly total.\n\nLet's start with Factory A:\n\n1. Daily production: 300 widgets\n\n2. Defect rate: 2%\n\nTo find the number of defective widgets per day for Factory A, we calculate 2% of 300.\n\nDefective widgets per day for Factory A = 300 * (2/100) = 300 * 0.02 = 6 widgets\n\nNow, for Factory B:\n\n1. Daily production: 500 widgets\n\n2. Defect rate: 1.5%\n\nSimilarly, defective widgets per day for Factory B = 500 * (1.5/100) = 500 * 0.015 = 7.5 widgets\n\nWait, 7.5 widgets? That's half a widget, which might not make sense in reality, but for the sake of this calculation, we'll proceed with the numbers given.\n\nNow, to find the total defective widgets per day from both factories:\n\nTotal defective per day = Defective from A + Defective from B = 6 + 7.5 = 13.5 widgets\n\nNow, for one week (7 days):\n\nTotal defective per week = 13.5 * 7 = 94.5 widgets\n\nAgain, we have half a widget, which is unusual, but based on the given rates, this is the result.\n\nSo, the total number of defective widgets produced by both factories combined in one week is 94.5.\n\nHowever, since we can't have half a widget, we might need to round this number. If we round to the nearest whole number, it would be 95 widgets.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps we should consider that the defect rates are averages, and the actual number of defects can vary each day. But based on the given information, 94.5 is the calculated value.\n\nAlternatively, if the factories don't produce half widgets, maybe the defect rates are such that defects are whole numbers. In that case, perhaps the defect rates are approximations, and the actual number of defects per day is rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nLet's explore that:\n\nFor Factory A:\n\n300 * 0.02 = 6 widgets (already a whole number)\n\nFor Factory B:\n\n500 * 0.015 = 7.5 widgets\n\nIf we round 7.5 to the nearest whole number, it's 8 widgets.\n\nSo, total defective per day would be 6 + 8 = 14 widgets\n\nThen, for one week: 14 * 7 = 98 widgets\n\nAlternatively, if we round down 7.5 to 7:\n\nTotal per day: 6 + 7 = 13 widgets\n\nTotal per week: 13 * 7 = 91 widgets\n\nBut typically, when dealing with averages, we don't round intermediate calculations; we keep the decimal and round only the final answer.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial calculation:\n\nTotal defective per week = 13.5 * 7 = 94.5 widgets\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 95 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the combined defective widgets produced by both factories in one week is approximately 95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{95} \\]"
