        "content": "Let's see. So, the car factory produces 150 cars per day and operates for 20 days each month. I need to find out how many cars it produces in one year.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cars are produced in one month. Since it produces 150 cars per day and operates for 20 days, I can multiply those two numbers to get the monthly production.\n\nSo, 150 cars/day * 20 days/month = 3,000 cars/month.\n\nNow, to find out the annual production, I need to calculate how many cars are produced in 12 months, right? Because there are 12 months in a year.\n\nSo, 3,000 cars/month * 12 months/year = 36,000 cars/year.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's anything else to consider. For example, does the factory operate the same number of days every month? Or are there months with more or fewer operating days?\n\nThe problem says it operates for 20 days in a month, so I'll assume that's consistent across all months.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any holidays or downtime that might affect the number of operating days. But since the problem doesn't mention any, I'll proceed with the given information.\n\nSo, my final answer is 36,000 cars per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36000} \\]"
