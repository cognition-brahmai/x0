        "content": "Let's see. Alice can paint a room in 5 hours, and Bob can do it in 7 hours. If they start painting together at 9 AM, I need to find out when they'll finish.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much of the room each person can paint per hour. That way, I can see how much they can do together per hour.\n\nAlice paints the room in 5 hours, so her painting rate is 1/5 of the room per hour.\n\nBob paints the room in 7 hours, so his painting rate is 1/7 of the room per hour.\n\nTogether, their combined painting rate should be the sum of their individual rates, right?\n\nSo, combined rate = 1/5 + 1/7.\n\nTo add those fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 7 is 35.\n\nSo, 1/5 = 7/35, and 1/7 = 5/35.\n\nAdding them up: 7/35 + 5/35 = 12/35 of the room per hour.\n\nThat means, together, they can paint 12/35 of the room in one hour.\n\nNow, to find out how many hours it will take them to paint the whole room, I can set up the equation:\n\nTime = Total work / Rate\n\nTotal work is 1 room, and their rate is 12/35 room per hour.\n\nSo, Time = 1 / (12/35) = 35/12 hours.\n\n35/12 hours is the same as 2.9167 hours.\n\nTo convert that to hours and minutes, 2 hours plus 0.9167 hours.\n\n0.9167 hours * 60 minutes/hour = about 55 minutes.\n\nSo, total time is approximately 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nThey start at 9 AM, so adding 2 hours and 55 minutes to that time.\n\n9 AM + 2 hours = 11 AM, plus 55 minutes = about 11:55 AM.\n\nWait, but is 35/12 exactly 2.9167 hours? Let's do the division carefully.\n\n35 divided by 12 is 2 with a remainder of 11, so 2 and 11/12 hours.\n\n11/12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 55 minutes.\n\nYes, so 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nStarting at 9 AM, plus 2 hours is 11 AM, plus 55 minutes is 11:55 AM.\n\nSo, they should finish painting the room at 11:55 AM.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure.\n\nFirst, individual rates:\n\nAlice: 1/5 room per hour\n\nBob: 1/7 room per hour\n\nCombined: 1/5 + 1/7 = 7/35 + 5/35 = 12/35 room per hour.\n\nTime = 1 / (12/35) = 35/12 hours.\n\n35/12 hours is exactly 2 hours and 11/12 hours.\n\n11/12 hours is 55 minutes.\n\nSo, total time is 2 hours and 55 minutes.\n\nStarting at 9:00 AM, plus 2 hours is 11:00 AM, plus 55 minutes is indeed 11:55 AM.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11:55 \\text{ AM}} \\]"
