        "content": "Let's see here. The farmer has 15 sheep, and the statement says \"all but 8 die.\" So, I need to figure out how many sheep are left alive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"all but 8 die\" means. Does it mean that all the sheep die except for 8? Or is there something else I'm missing?\n\nLet me think about the phrase \"all but.\" In everyday language, \"all but\" something usually means everything except that something. So, \"all but 8 die\" might mean that all the sheep die except for 8 of them.\n\nIf that's the case, then if the farmer had 15 sheep and all but 8 die, that means 15 - 8 = 7 sheep die, and 8 sheep survive.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps there's another way to interpret \"all but 8 die.\"\n\nLet me consider another perspective. Could \"all but 8\" refer to something else, like the number of sheep that didn't die?\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and the \"all but 8 die\" refers to a different group, but that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me look up the phrase \"all but\" to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly.\n\nAccording to dictionaries, \"all but\" means \"all except for,\" \"virtually,\" or \"almost.\" In this context, it most likely means \"all except for 8.\"\n\nSo, if the farmer has 15 sheep and all but 8 die, that means that all sheep except for 8 die. Therefore, 8 sheep survive.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it is that \"all but 8 die\" could mean that 8 sheep don't die, implying that they are left alive.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of sheep left alive is 8.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it. Maybe some of the sheep are still alive but sold or moved elsewhere.\n\nWait, the question says \"all but 8 die.\" It doesn't mention anything about selling or moving the sheep. So, probably, the only thing happening is that some sheep die and some don't.\n\nSo, if the farmer had 15 sheep and all but 8 die, that means that 8 sheep do not die, and the rest do.\n\nTherefore, the number of sheep left is 8.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nSuppose the farmer has 15 sheep.\n\nIf \"all but 8 die,\" it means that 15 - 8 = 7 sheep die.\n\nTherefore, 8 sheep survive.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a play on words here.\n\nLet me consider the phrase again: \"all but 8 die.\"\n\nDoes \"all but 8\" refer to the sheep that die, or the sheep that don't die?\n\nIf \"all but 8 die,\" it means that all sheep die except for 8.\n\nSo, 8 sheep do not die.\n\nTherefore, the number of sheep left alive is 8.\n\nAlternatively, if \"all but 8\" die, it could be interpreted as \"all except 8\" die, which again means that 8 sheep do not die.\n\nSo, in either case, it seems that 8 sheep are left alive.\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick in the wording.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the farmer has 15 sheep, and all but 8 die. How many are left?\"\n\nIf 8 sheep are left alive, then the answer is 8.\n\nBut maybe the question is trying to trick me into subtracting 8 from 15, which would be 7, but that would mean 7 sheep die, not how many are left.\n\nWait, no, the question is asking how many are left, which would be the ones that didn't die, which is 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"all but 8 die\" means that all of the sheep die except for 8, so 8 are left alive.\n\nBut again, that seems too straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"all but 8\" refers to the number of sheep that die, meaning that all sheep except for 8 die, which again would mean that 8 are left alive.\n\nWait, or maybe \"all but 8 die\" means that all of the sheep die, except for 8 of them.\n\nIn that case, again, 8 sheep are left alive.\n\nI think I'm just overcomplicating this.\n\nThe answer should be 8 sheep are left.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any other interpretations.\n\nSuppose \"all but 8 die\" means that all of the sheep die, except for 8 of them, which survive.\n\nIn that case, the number of sheep left is 8.\n\nAlternatively, if \"all but 8\" refers to the number of sheep that die, then 15 - 8 = 7 sheep die, and 8 are left alive.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nI think no matter how I look at it, the answer is 8 sheep are left alive.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from the phrasing, but based on standard English, \"all but 8 die\" means that all sheep die except for 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of sheep left is 8.\n\nI should probably just go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
