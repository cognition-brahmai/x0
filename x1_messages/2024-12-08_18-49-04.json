        "content": "Let's see. So, the train is going at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then it slows down to 30 miles per hour for another 2 hours. I need to find out how far it's traveled in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how far it travels during each part of the trip and then add those distances together.\n\nSo, for the first part, it's going at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. I think distance is calculated by speed multiplied by time, right? So, 60 miles per hour times 2 hours should give me the distance for the first part.\n\nLet me do the math: 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nOkay, so the first part is 120 miles.\n\nNow, for the second part, it's going at 30 miles per hour for another 2 hours. Again, distance is speed times time, so 30 miles per hour times 2 hours.\n\nThat would be: 30 miles/hour * 2 hours = 60 miles.\n\nSo, the second part is 60 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add those two distances together: 120 miles + 60 miles = 180 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me think again. The train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, which is 120 miles, and then at 30 mph for another 2 hours, which is 60 miles. Adding them up gives 180 miles.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here, like stops or anything, because it doesn't mention anything like that. So, the total distance should be 180 miles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of average speed or something, but that seems unnecessary because the speeds are given for specific time intervals.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to plot the speed over time, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nLet me consider if the train is slowing down uniformly between the two speeds, but the problem says it travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then slows down to 30 mph for another 2 hours. It doesn't say anything about the deceleration process, so I think it's safe to assume that the speed changes instantly between the two phases.\n\nSo, again, 120 miles plus 60 miles equals 180 miles.\n\nI think that's the answer: the train has traveled a total of 180 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
