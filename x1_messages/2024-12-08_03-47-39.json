        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are 30 people in a group, and among them, 18 have a dog, 12 have a cat, and 7 have both a dog and a cat. I need to find out how many people have neither a dog nor a cat. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that when dealing with groups and overlapping categories, it's often helpful to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That's where you add the sizes of the individual groups and then subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, here's what I know:\n\n- Total people, n = 30\n\n- People with dogs, D = 18\n\n- People with cats, C = 12\n\n- People with both dogs and cats, D \u2229 C = 7\n\nI need to find the number of people who have neither, which I can think of as the complement of those who have either a dog or a cat or both.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many people have either a dog or a cat or both. Using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nNumber of people with a dog or a cat = D + C - D \u2229 C\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 18 + 12 - 7\n\n= 30 - 7\n\n= 23\n\nSo, 23 people have either a dog, a cat, or both.\n\nNow, to find those who have neither, I subtract this number from the total number of people:\n\nNeither = Total - (Dog or Cat)\n\n= 30 - 23\n\n= 7\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I'm missing anything.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to use a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping. One circle represents dog owners, and the other represents cat owners.\n\n- The overlap, D \u2229 C, is 7 people who have both.\n\n- The number of people who have only dogs would be D - D \u2229 C = 18 - 7 = 11\n\n- The number of people who have only cats would be C - D \u2229 C = 12 - 7 = 5\n\nSo, adding up those who have only dogs, only cats, and both:\n\nOnly dogs: 11\n\nOnly cats: 5\n\nBoth: 7\n\nTotal with pets: 11 + 5 + 7 = 23\n\nAgain, subtracting from the total number of people:\n\nNeither: 30 - 23 = 7\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems like 7 people have neither a dog nor a cat.\n\nLet me consider if there's another approach to confirm this. Maybe using probabilities or other set theory principles.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of sets.\n\nLet the universal set U be the group of 30 people.\n\nLet set D be the set of dog owners, with |D| = 18.\n\nLet set C be the set of cat owners, with |C| = 12.\n\nThe intersection, |D \u2229 C| = 7.\n\nWe need to find the number of people who are in neither D nor C, which is the complement of D union C, denoted as (D \u222a C)'.\n\nFrom set theory, we know that:\n\n|U| = |D \u222a C| + |(D \u222a C)'|\n\nWe need to find |(D \u222a C)'|, which is the number of people with neither.\n\nFirst, find |D \u222a C| using the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|D \u222a C| = |D| + |C| - |D \u2229 C|\n\n= 18 + 12 - 7\n\n= 23\n\nThen,\n\n|(D \u222a C)'| = |U| - |D \u222a C|\n\n= 30 - 23\n\n= 7\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me confidence that 7 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any assumptions or tricks in the problem that I might have overlooked.\n\nFor example, is it possible that some people have other pets, but the question is only about dogs and cats? The question specifies \"neither a dog nor a cat,\" so I think it's safe to assume that other pets, if any, don't affect the count.\n\nAlso, the problem states that 7 people have both a dog and a cat. Is there any possibility that these 7 are included in the counts for dog and cat owners, or do I need to add them separately? According to the inclusion-exclusion principle, the intersection is subtracted to avoid double-counting, which I've already done.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any people who don't have any pets at all? The question asks for the number of people who have neither a dog nor a cat, implying that they may or may not have other types of pets. However, since the question is only about dogs and cats, I think the \"neither\" category includes people who might have other pets or no pets at all.\n\nGiven that, and based on the calculations above, I conclude that 7 people have neither a dog nor a cat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
