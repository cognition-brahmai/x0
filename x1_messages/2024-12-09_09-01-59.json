        "content": "Alright, I'm going to attempt to write a simple e-commerce system in Java, focusing on object-oriented programming principles. I need to create classes for products, a catalog to hold those products, a shopping cart for users to add items, a checkout process to handle purchases, and a way to keep track of order history.\n\nFirst, I need to define what a product is. A product should have a name, a price, and maybe an ID for uniqueness. So, I'll create a Product class with these attributes.\n\nNext, I need a catalog to hold multiple products. This catalog should allow adding products, removing products, and perhaps searching for products by name or ID. I can use a List to store the products.\n\nThen, I need a shopping cart where users can add products they want to buy. The cart should be able to add items, remove items, and calculate the total cost. I should also keep track of the quantity of each product in the cart.\n\nAfter that, I need a checkout process. This should take the items in the cart, confirm the order, and perhaps deduct the items from the catalog's inventory. I might need to handle payment processing here, but for simplicity, I'll just simulate the checkout without actual payment details.\n\nFinally, I need to keep track of order history. Maybe each order can be represented as a class with a list of products purchased, the total amount, and perhaps a unique order ID.\n\nLet me start by defining the Product class.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple e-commerce system in Java using object-oriented programming principles, we need to model several components: products, a catalog to manage products, a shopping cart for users to add items, a checkout process to handle purchases, and a way to track order history.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Product Class**: Represents individual products with attributes like ID, name, and price.\n2. **Catalog Class**: Manages a collection of products, allowing addition, removal, and retrieval of products.\n3. **ShoppingCart Class**: Allows users to add and remove products and calculate the total cost.\n4. **Checkout Class**: Simulates the checkout process, creating orders from the shopping cart.\n5. **Order Class**: Represents a purchased order with details like order ID, list of products, and total amount.\n6. **OrderHistory Class**: Manages a collection of orders for a user.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass Product {\n    private String id;\n    private String name;\n    private double price;\n\n    public Product(String id, String name, double price) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.price = price;\n    }\n\n    public String getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public double getPrice() {\n        return price;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Catalog {\n    private List<Product> products;\n\n    public Catalog() {\n        products = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void addProduct(Product product) {\n        products.add(product);\n    }\n\n    public void removeProduct(String id) {\n        products.removeIf(p -> p.getId().equals(id));\n    }\n\n    public List<Product> getProducts() {\n        return products;\n    }\n\n    public Product getProductById(String id) {\n        for (Product p : products) {\n            if (p.getId().equals(id)) {\n                return p;\n            }\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n\nclass ShoppingCart {\n    private Map<Product, Integer> items;\n\n    public ShoppingCart() {\n        items = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public void addProduct(Product product, int quantity) {\n        items.put(product, items.getOrDefault(product, 0) + quantity);\n    }\n\n    public void removeProduct(Product product, int quantity) {\n        int currentQuantity = items.getOrDefault(product, 0);\n        if (currentQuantity > quantity) {\n            items.put(product, currentQuantity - quantity);\n        } else {\n            items.remove(product);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public double getTotal() {\n        double total = 0;\n        for (Map.Entry<Product, Integer> entry : items.entrySet()) {\n            total += entry.getKey().getPrice() * entry.getValue();\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n\n    public List<Product> getItems() {\n        List<Product> productList = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Map.Entry<Product, Integer> entry : items.entrySet()) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < entry.getValue(); i++) {\n                productList.add(entry.getKey());\n            }\n        }\n        return productList;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Order {\n    private String orderId;\n    private List<Product> products;\n    private double total;\n\n    public Order(String orderId, List<Product> products, double total) {\n        this.orderId = orderId;\n        this.products = products;\n        this.total = total;\n    }\n\n    public String getOrderId() {\n        return orderId;\n    }\n\n    public List<Product> getProducts() {\n        return products;\n    }\n\n    public double getTotal() {\n        return total;\n    }\n}\n\nclass OrderHistory {\n    private List<Order> orders;\n\n    public OrderHistory() {\n        orders = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void addOrder(Order order) {\n        orders.add(order);\n    }\n\n    public List<Order> getOrders() {\n        return orders;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Checkout {\n    public static Order createOrder(ShoppingCart cart, String orderId) {\n        List<Product> items = cart.getItems();\n        double total = cart.getTotal();\n        return new Order(orderId, items, total);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ECommerceSystem {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a catalog\n        Catalog catalog = new Catalog();\n        catalog.addProduct(new Product(\"p1\", \"Laptop\", 1000));\n        catalog.addProduct(new Product(\"p2\", \"Smartphone\", 500));\n        catalog.addProduct(new Product(\"p3\", \"Tablet\", 250));\n\n        // Create a shopping cart\n        ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();\n        cart.addProduct(catalog.getProductById(\"p1\"), 1);\n        cart.addProduct(catalog.getProductById(\"p2\"), 2);\n\n        // Checkout and create an order\n        Order order = Checkout.createOrder(cart, \"o1\");\n        System.out.println(\"Order ID: \" + order.getOrderId());\n        System.out.println(\"Total: \" + order.getTotal());\n\n        // Order history\n        OrderHistory orderHistory = new OrderHistory();\n        orderHistory.addOrder(order);\n        for (Order o : orderHistory.getOrders()) {\n            System.out.println(\"Order ID: \" + o.getOrderId() + \", Total: \" + o.getTotal());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Product Class**: Represents individual products with ID, name, and price.\n- **Catalog Class**: Manages products, allowing addition, removal, and retrieval.\n- **ShoppingCart Class**: Manages user's selected products and quantities, and calculates the total cost.\n- **Checkout Class**: Contains a static method to create an order from the shopping cart.\n- **Order Class**: Represents a purchased order with order ID, list of products, and total amount.\n- **OrderHistory Class**: Manages a collection of orders.\n\nThis simple e-commerce system demonstrates basic operations like adding products to a catalog, managing a shopping cart, checking out, and maintaining order history, all adhering to object-oriented principles."
