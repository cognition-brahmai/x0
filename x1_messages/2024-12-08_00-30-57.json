        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a farmer who has a rectangular field, and he wants to divide it into equal square plots for planting different crops. The field is 200 meters long and 150 meters wide. I need to figure out what the largest possible size of each square plot is, and how many such plots he can create.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to divide a rectangular field into equal square plots. Each square plot should have the same side length, and they should fit perfectly within the rectangle without any overlapping or going outside the field's boundaries.\n\nSo, the side length of each square plot has to be a divisor of both the length and the width of the field. That way, the number of squares that fit along the length and the width are both whole numbers.\n\nFor example, if the side length of the square is 10 meters, then along the 200-meter length, there would be 200 / 10 = 20 squares, and along the 150-meter width, there would be 150 / 10 = 15 squares. So, the total number of plots would be 20 * 15 = 300 plots.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the largest possible size of each square plot. So, I need to find the largest possible side length that divides both 200 and 150 evenly.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem involving the greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nSo, if I can find the GCD of 200 and 150, that should give me the largest possible side length for the square plots.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One common method is the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying the following step:\n\nDivide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\nThen replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n\nRepeat this process until the remainder is zero. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder.\n\nSo, let's apply that to 200 and 150.\n\nFirst, divide 200 by 150.\n\n200 \u00f7 150 = 1 with a remainder of 50.\n\nNow, replace 200 with 150 and 150 with 50.\n\nNext, divide 150 by 50.\n\n150 \u00f7 50 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 50.\n\nSo, the largest possible side length for each square plot is 50 meters.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many such plots the farmer can create.\n\nTo do that, I'll divide the length and the width of the field by the side length of the square plot and then multiply the results.\n\nLength of the field: 200 meters\n\nWidth of the field: 150 meters\n\nSide length of each square plot: 50 meters\n\nNumber of plots along the length: 200 / 50 = 4\n\nNumber of plots along the width: 150 / 50 = 3\n\nTotal number of plots: 4 * 3 = 12\n\nSo, the farmer can create 12 square plots of 50 meters by 50 meters each.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf each plot is 50 meters by 50 meters, then 4 plots along the length would cover 4 * 50 = 200 meters, which matches the length of the field.\n\nSimilarly, 3 plots along the width would cover 3 * 50 = 150 meters, which matches the width of the field.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the area of the field and divide it by the area of one square plot.\n\nArea of the field: 200 meters * 150 meters = 30,000 square meters\n\nArea of one square plot: 50 meters * 50 meters = 2,500 square meters\n\nTotal number of plots: 30,000 / 2,500 = 12\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's a larger possible square plot size than 50 meters.\n\nSuppose I consider a square plot size of 60 meters.\n\nDoes 60 divide both 200 and 150?\n\n200 \u00f7 60 = 3.333..., which is not a whole number.\n\n150 \u00f7 60 = 2.5, which is also not a whole number.\n\nSo, 60 meters is too large.\n\nWhat about 40 meters?\n\n200 \u00f7 40 = 5\n\n150 \u00f7 40 = 3.75\n\nNot a whole number, so 40 meters doesn't work.\n\nWhat about 25 meters?\n\n200 \u00f7 25 = 8\n\n150 \u00f7 25 = 6\n\nThat works, but 25 is smaller than 50, so 50 is still the largest possible.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that 50 is the GCD, so it should be the largest possible.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's check if there are any common divisors larger than 50 for 200 and 150.\n\nLet's list the divisors of 200 and 150.\n\nDivisors of 200: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200\n\nDivisors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150\n\nCommon divisors: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100\n\nWait, does 100 divide both 200 and 150?\n\n200 \u00f7 100 = 2\n\n150 \u00f7 100 = 1.5\n\nThat's not a whole number, so 100 is not a common divisor.\n\nSo, the common divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.\n\nTherefore, 50 is indeed the greatest common divisor.\n\nSo, the largest possible square plot size is 50 meters, and the farmer can create 12 such plots.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ meters},\\ 12\\ \\text{plots}} \\]"
