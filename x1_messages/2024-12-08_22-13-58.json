        "content": "Alright, I need to find out what snow leopards eat and where they live. I think I can use the WebSearch tool to look up information about snow leopards. Maybe start with that.\n\nPlan: Search for information about snow leopards' diet and habitat.\n\n#E1 = WebSearch[\"snow leopard diet and habitat\"]\n\nOkay, so #E1 should give me some search results with websites that talk about snow leopards' diet and where they live. I probably need to pick a few of those websites and extract the text to get the specific information.\n\nPlan: Extract text from the top three URLs in the search results.\n\n#E2 = TextExtractor[#E1[1:3]]\n\nNow, with the text extracted from those websites, I can use the QA tool to answer the specific questions about diet and habitat.\n\nPlan: Use QA tool to find the main diet of snow leopards.\n\n#E3 = QA[\"What is the main diet of snow leopards?\", given #E2]\n\nPlan: Use QA tool to find where snow leopards usually live.\n\n#E4 = QA[\"Where do snow leopards usually live?\", given #E2]\n\nI think that should give me the information I need. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for some images of snow leopards in their natural habitat. That might help confirm where they live.\n\nPlan: Find images of snow leopards in their habitat.\n\n#E5 = ImageFinder[\"snow leopard habitat\"]\n\nThen, I can analyze those images to get more context about their living environment.\n\nPlan: Analyze the images to describe snow leopards' habitat.\n\n#E6 = ImageAnalyzer[#E5]\n\nThis might give me some descriptive text about the images, which could reinforce the information I got from the text.\n\nFinally, I can compile the answers from #E3 and #E4, and maybe add some details from #E6 if they provide relevant information.\n\nFinal Answer: According to the information gathered, snow leopards primarily eat [insert diet from #E3] and they usually live in [insert habitat from #E4]. Additionally, image analysis suggests that their habitat is characterized by [insert relevant details from #E6].\n\n## Final Solution\nTo answer the question about the main diet of snow leopards and where they usually live, the following plan is devised using available tools:\n\n1. **Search for Information:**\n   - Use the `WebSearch` tool to find information about snow leopards' diet and habitat.\n     ```plaintext\n     #E1 = WebSearch[\"snow leopard diet and habitat\"]\n     ```\n\n2. **Extract Text from Relevant Sources:**\n   - Use the `TextExtractor` tool to extract text from the top three URLs obtained from the search results.\n     ```plaintext\n     #E2 = TextExtractor[#E1[1:3]]\n     ```\n\n3. **Determine Diet:**\n   - Utilize the `QA` tool to identify the main diet of snow leopards based on the extracted text.\n     ```plaintext\n     #E3 = QA[\"What is the main diet of snow leopards?\", given #E2]\n     ```\n\n4. **Determine Habitat:**\n   - Use the `QA` tool again to find where snow leopards usually live, using the same extracted text.\n     ```plaintext\n     #E4 = QA[\"Where do snow leopards usually live?\", given #E2]\n     ```\n\n5. **Visual Confirmation:**\n   - Employ the `ImageFinder` tool to find images of snow leopards in their habitat for additional context.\n     ```plaintext\n     #E5 = ImageFinder[\"snow leopard habitat\"]\n     ```\n\n6. **Analyze Images:**\n   - Use the `ImageAnalyzer` tool to describe the habitat depicted in the found images.\n     ```plaintext\n     #E6 = ImageAnalyzer[#E5]\n     ```\n\n7. **Compile Final Answer:**\n   - Combine the information from steps 3 and 4, and augment with relevant details from step 6 if necessary.\n     ```plaintext\n     Final Answer: According to the information gathered, snow leopards primarily eat [insert diet from #E3] and they usually live in [insert habitat from #E4]. Additionally, image analysis suggests that their habitat is characterized by [insert relevant details from #E6].\n     ```\n\nThis approach ensures a comprehensive understanding by leveraging both textual and visual data sources to answer the query accurately."
