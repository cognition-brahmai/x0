To find out how far light travels in 10 minutes, we need to calculate the distance covered at this speed over that time period.\n\nFirst, convert 10 minutes into seconds:\n\n10 minutes \u00d7 60 seconds per minute = 600 seconds\n\nNow, multiply the speed of light by the time in seconds:\n\n299,792 km/s \u00d7 600 s = 179,875,200 kilometers\n\nSo, light travels about 179,875,200 kilometers in 10 minutes."
