Each plan will have a corresponding evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that could be the user question, one or more previous evidence values, or a mixture of both.\n\nAvailable tools are:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Allows the user to search for information using DuckDuckGo's search engine. Useful for locating a list of sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteLoader[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-delimited links. Input is one or more links, producing plain text output containing the link contents.\nUrlExtractor[input]: Extracts URLs from plain text, providing a plain text, newline-separated response of URLs.\nInfoGenie[input]: Question-answering language model, particularly adept at answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question referencing a :fact[n]: variable, e.g., What color is the cat, given :fact1:?\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [First action based on input question]\n:fact0: = [Function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [Next action based on result of :fact0:]\n:fact1: = [Next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous fact, e.g., \"Given context :fact0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:fact[n]: Containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what are their most acclaimed works?"
