        "content": "I'm here to help you with your question about graph theory. You've asked to prove that in a graph G with vertices V and edges E, the number of edges |E| is less than or equal to (|V|^2 - |V|)/2. Let's dive into this step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what kind of graph we're dealing with. The formula you've provided suggests that we're talking about a simple undirected graph, which means there are no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n\nIn a simple undirected graph with |V| vertices, the maximum number of edges possible is given by the combination formula C(|V|, 2), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of |V| to form an edge. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nIn this case, n is |V| and k is 2, so:\n\nC(|V|, 2) = |V|! / (2! * (|V| - 2)!) = (|V| * (|V| - 1) * (|V| - 2)! ) / (2 * 1 * (|V| - 2)! ) = (|V| * (|V| - 1)) / 2\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\nC(|V|, 2) = (|V|^2 - |V|) / 2\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges in a simple undirected graph with |V| vertices is (|V|^2 - |V|)/2.\n\nNow, since a simple undirected graph cannot have more edges than this maximum, it follows that the number of edges |E| is less than or equal to (|V|^2 - |V|)/2.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n|E| \u2264 (|V|^2 - |V|)/2\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nIt's worth noting that if the graph were directed, the maximum number of edges would be different because each pair of vertices can have two possible edges (one in each direction). However, since the question specifies a graph without further qualification, we assume it's undirected and simple.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the proof for you. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
