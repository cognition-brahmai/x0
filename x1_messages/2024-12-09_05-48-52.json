        "content": "Yes, the United States entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese military launched a surprise attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, which led to the deaths of over 2,400 Americans and the destruction of numerous ships and aircraft. The following day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his famous \"Infamy Speech\" to Congress, calling for a declaration of war against Japan. Congress obliged, and the U.S. formally entered World War II on December 8, 1941. The attack on Pearl Harbor is often referred to as \"the day that will live in infamy.\""
