        "content": "Let's see. So, the car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and we need to find out how far it will go in 2 hours and 45 minutes. First, I need to make sure that the time is in the same units as the speed. The speed is given in miles per hour, so it would be best to convert the time into hours.\n\nI know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 hours. Let me calculate that:\n\n45 \u00f7 60 = 0.75 hours.\n\nSo, 2 hours and 45 minutes is the same as 2.75 hours.\n\nNow, to find the distance, I can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nDistance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 2.75 hours\n\nNow, let's multiply that:\n\n60 \u00d7 2.75 = 60 \u00d7 2 + 60 \u00d7 0.75\n\n60 \u00d7 2 = 120\n\n60 \u00d7 0.75 = 45\n\nSo, 120 + 45 = 165 miles.\n\nTherefore, the car will travel 165 miles in 2 hours and 45 minutes at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]"
