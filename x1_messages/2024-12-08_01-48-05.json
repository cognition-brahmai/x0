        "content": "The 1994 film you're referring to is \"Speed.\" In this action thriller, Keanu Reeves plays Jack Traven, a former LAPD officer turned bus driver, who finds himself at the center of a dangerous situation when a bomb is planted on the bus he's driving. The bomb is set to explode if the bus drops below 50 miles per hour, forcing Jack and the passengers to try and stay above that speed to prevent detonation. Sandra Bullock stars as Annie Porter, a federal building inspector who becomes involved in the unfolding crisis. The film also features Dennis Hopper as the antagonist, Harry, who has set up the bomb as part of a larger scheme. \"Speed\" is known for its high-octane chase sequences and tense suspense, making it a classic of the action genre."
