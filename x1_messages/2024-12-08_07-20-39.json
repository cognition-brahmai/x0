There are 120 full-time employees, each earning an average of $45,000 per year. So, the total salary for full-time employees is:\n\n120 employees * $45,000/employee = $5,400,000\n\nNext, let's find the total salary paid to part-time employees. There are 80 part-time employees, each earning an average of $25,000 per year. So, the total salary for part-time employees is:\n\n80 employees * $25,000/employee = $2,000,000\n\nNow, let's add the total salaries for both full-time and part-time employees to get the overall total salary paid in the company:\n\n$5,400,000 (full-time) + $2,000,000 (part-time) = $7,400,000\n\nFinally, to find the average salary for all employees, we divide the total salary by the total number of employees, which is 200:\n\n$7,400,000 / 200 employees = $37,000 per employee\n\nSo, the average salary for all employees in the company is $37,000 per year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37000} \\]"
