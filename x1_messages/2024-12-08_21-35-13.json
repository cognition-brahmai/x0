Now, Taylor Swift has a lot of songs, and many of them are about relationships and breakups, so I think I can find some suitable lyrics for this.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the tone of the message. Breakup messages can be sad, angry, reflective, or a mix of emotions. Taylor Swift's lyrics cover all these emotions, so I have plenty to choose from.\n\nMaybe I should start with acknowledging the end of the relationship. In \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" she sings, \"We are never ever getting back together.\" That's pretty straightforward.\n\nBut I also need to express why the breakup is happening. In \"Style,\" there's a line, \"I've been spending way too much time daydreaming, wishing I could turn back time.\" Maybe that suggests regret or realization that things aren't working out.\n\nPerhaps adding some emotion from \"All Too Well\": \"I drove away, never looked back, no, no. I put my sorrow in a box and watched it get too big.\" This could indicate moving on and not holding on to the past.\n\nAlso, from \"Begin Again,\" there's, \"I never meant to cause you trouble, I never meant to cause you pain.\" That might be a way to apologize or express that the breakup wasn't intentional.\n\nMaybe include a line from \"Clean,\" which is about moving on: \"And I'll betellin' all my friends about the good times that we had. But baby, you can look around, everything's just the same, except for you and me.\"\n\nAnd perhaps add a touch of finality with a line from \"State of Grace\": \"And I will hold my head up high, with a state of grace.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, the breakup text could go something like this:\n\n\"Hey,\n\nI've been spending way too much time daydreaming, wishing I could turn back time. But we are never ever getting back together. I've put my sorrow in a box and watched it get too big. I never meant to cause you trouble, I never meant to cause you pain. But baby, you can look around, everything's just the same, except for me. And I will hold my head up high, with a state of grace.\n\nTake care,\n\n[Your Name]\"\n\nI think that covers the main points: acknowledging the end, expressing emotions, and moving forward with grace.\n\n**Final Solution**\nTo create a breakup text message using only song lyrics by Taylor Swift, you can curate a selection of verses that reflect the emotions and sentiments appropriate for such a situation. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to construct this message:\n\n1. **Start with a acknowledgment of the end:**\n   - Use lyrics from \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\":\n     > We are never ever getting back together.\n\n2. **Express regret or realization:**\n   - Incorporate lines from \"Style\":\n     > I've been spending way too much time daydreaming, wishing I could turn back time.\n\n3. **Indicate moving on:**\n   - Add lyrics from \"All Too Well\":\n     > I drove away, never looked back, no, no. I put my sorrow in a box and watched it get too big.\n\n4. **Offer an apology or explanation:**\n   - Include a verse from \"Begin Again\":\n     > I never meant to cause you trouble, I never meant to cause you pain.\n\n5. **Emphasize the change in your life:**\n   - Use lines from \"Clean\":\n     > And I'll be tellin' all my friends about the good times that we had. But baby, you can look around, everything's just the same, except for you and me.\n\n6. **Conclude with a message of personal growth:**\n   - End with a line from \"State of Grace\":\n     > And I will hold my head up high, with a state of grace.\n\n**Final Breakup Message:**\n\n> Hey,\n>\n> I've been spending way too much time daydreaming, wishing I could turn back time. But we are never ever getting back together. I've put my sorrow in a box and watched it get too big. I never meant to cause you trouble, I never meant to cause you pain. But baby, you can look around, everything's just the same, except for me. And I will hold my head up high, with a state of grace.\n>\n> Take care,\n>\n> [Your Name]\n\nThis approach ensures that the message is composed entirely of Taylor Swift's lyrics while effectively communicating the necessary emotions and conclusions associated with a breakup."
