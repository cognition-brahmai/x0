For each step of your plan, indicate which tool you would use and what input you would provide to that tool. You can store the output from each tool in a variable :evidence[index]: for reference in later steps.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nGoogleSearch[input]: This tool allows you to perform a Google search on any given topic. The input should be a string representing the search query.\nLinkExtractor[input]: This tool extracts all URLs from a given text. The input should be a string containing one or more URLs.\nWebScraper[input]: This tool scrapes the content of a webpage. The input should be a URL.\nTextAnalyzer[input]: This tool analyzes a block of text and answers questions based on the information found within it. The input should be a question with an optional context provided by referencing an evidence variable (e.g., \"What is the main theme of the story? Given context: :evidence1:\").\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the history behind the construction of Eiffel Tower and who were the key people involved?"
