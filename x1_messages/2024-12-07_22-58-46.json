        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a company with 100 employees. Out of these, 40% are engineers, 30% are managers, and the remaining are support staff. I need to find out how many more engineers there are than support staff.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many engineers there are. Since 40% of the employees are engineers, and there are 100 employees in total, the number of engineers is 40% of 100. That would be:\n\nNumber of engineers = 40% of 100 = 0.40 * 100 = 40 engineers\n\nNext, I need to find out how many managers there are. 30% of the employees are managers, so:\n\nNumber of managers = 30% of 100 = 0.30 * 100 = 30 managers\n\nNow, the rest of the employees are support staff. Since the total percentage must add up to 100%, the percentage of support staff is:\n\nPercentage of support staff = 100% - (percentage of engineers + percentage of managers) = 100% - (40% + 30%) = 100% - 70% = 30%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If 40% are engineers and 30% are managers, that adds up to 70%, so the remaining 30% should be support staff. But let me double-check that.\n\nTotal percentage = percentage of engineers + percentage of managers + percentage of support staff\n\n100% = 40% + 30% + percentage of support staff\n\nPercentage of support staff = 100% - 70% = 30%\n\nOkay, so support staff is also 30%. But that can't be, because if engineers are 40% and support staff is 30%, then managers are also 30%, which adds up to 100%. Wait, but the question says 40% are engineers, 30% are managers, and the rest are support staff. So, support staff is indeed 30%.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many more engineers there are than support staff. So, number of engineers is 40, and number of support staff is 30. Therefore, the difference is:\n\nNumber of engineers - number of support staff = 40 - 30 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 more engineers than support staff.\n\nBut wait a minute, if support staff is also 30%, same as managers, then how can there be more engineers than support staff? Oh, but according to the calculation, there are 40 engineers and 30 support staff, so indeed, there are 10 more engineers than support staff.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions or ratios.\n\nTotal employees = 100\n\nEngineers = 40% of 100 = 40\n\nManagers = 30% of 100 = 30\n\nSupport staff = 100 - (40 + 30) = 30\n\nSo, engineers = 40, support staff = 30\n\nDifference = 40 - 30 = 10\n\nAlternatively, if I were to express this in terms of ratios or fractions, but since the total number is 100, percentages directly translate to numbers, which makes it straightforward.\n\nI think the answer is 10 more engineers than support staff.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
