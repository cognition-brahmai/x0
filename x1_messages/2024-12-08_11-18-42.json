        "content": "Certainly! Here's a Python function that finds the second largest number in a list:\n\n```python\ndef second_largest(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        return None  # Not enough elements\n    \n    largest = float('-inf')\n    second_largest = float('-inf')\n    \n    for num in numbers:\n        if num > largest:\n            second_largest = largest\n            largest = num\n        elif num > second_largest and num != largest:\n            second_largest = num\n    \n    if second_largest == float('-inf'):\n        return None  # No second largest found\n    else:\n        return second_largest\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of numbers to it. For example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nprint(second_largest(numbers))  # Output: 7\n```\n\nThis function handles cases where the list has fewer than two elements or when there is no distinct second largest number."
