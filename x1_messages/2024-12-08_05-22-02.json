        "content": "Let's see. Emily has twice as many cats as dogs, and she has 3 more birds than cats. Altogether, she has 23 pets. I need to find out how many dogs she has.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to the different types of pets. Let's say:\n\n- Let d represent the number of dogs.\n\n- Since she has twice as many cats as dogs, the number of cats would be 2d.\n\n- She has 3 more birds than cats, so the number of birds would be 2d + 3.\n\nNow, the total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and birds, which equals 23. So, I can write the equation:\n\nd + 2d + (2d + 3) = 23\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\nd + 2d + 2d + 3 = 23\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n5d + 3 = 23\n\nNow, I'll subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n5d = 20\n\nThen, divide both sides by 5:\n\nd = 4\n\nSo, Emily has 4 dogs.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf d = 4, then cats = 2d = 8, and birds = 2d + 3 = 11.\n\nTotal pets: 4 + 8 + 11 = 23. That checks out.\n\nYes, Emily has 4 dogs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
