        "content": "Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19th, marks the day when the last enslaved African Americans in the Confederate states learned of their emancipation in 1865. While it is an important milestone in the history of slavery in the United States, it did not mark the end of slavery in the entire country.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, declared that all enslaved people in the Confederate states \"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\" However, this proclamation did not immediately free all enslaved people, as it only applied to states that had seceded from the Union and were in rebellion. It did not apply to enslaved people in the border states that remained loyal to the Union or to areas of the Confederacy that were already under Union control.\n\nIt was not until the passage of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was ratified on December 6, 1865, that slavery was officially abolished throughout the entire United States. The 13th Amendment states that \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\"\n\nTherefore, while Juneteenth is a significant day in recognizing the end of slavery in the Confederate states, the 13th Amendment marked the legal abolition of slavery across the entire country."
