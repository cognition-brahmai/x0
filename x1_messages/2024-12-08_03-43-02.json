        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of candies: type A and type B. Type A costs $4 per pound, and type B costs $8 per pound. The customer buys a total of 12 pounds of candy and spends $72. We need to find out how many pounds of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of pounds of type A candy.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of pounds of type B candy.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total weight of the candies is 12 pounds.\n\n2. The total cost of the candies is $72.\n\nSo, we can write two equations based on these pieces of information.\n\nFirst equation: the total weight.\n\n\\( x + y = 12 \\)\n\nSecond equation: the total cost.\n\nSince type A costs $4 per pound and type B costs $8 per pound, the total cost would be:\n\n\\( 4x + 8y = 72 \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables.\n\n1. \\( x + y = 12 \\)\n\n2. \\( 4x + 8y = 72 \\)\n\nI think the easiest way to solve this is by using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for one of the variables, say \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 12 - y \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( 4(12 - y) + 8y = 72 \\)\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n\\( 48 - 4y + 8y = 72 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 48 + 4y = 72 \\)\n\nNow, subtract 48 from both sides:\n\n\\( 4y = 24 \\)\n\nThen, divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\( y = 6 \\)\n\nSo, the customer bought 6 pounds of type B candy.\n\nNow, plug this value back into the expression we had for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 12 - y = 12 - 6 = 6 \\)\n\nTherefore, the customer bought 6 pounds of type A candy and 6 pounds of type B candy.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it makes sense. If they bought 6 pounds of type A at $4 per pound, that's \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\) dollars. For type B, 6 pounds at $8 per pound is \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\) dollars. Adding those up: \\( 24 + 48 = 72 \\), which matches the total amount spent. Also, \\( 6 + 6 = 12 \\) pounds, which matches the total weight. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the elimination method to solve the system of equations. Let's try that to confirm.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 12 \\)\n\n2. \\( 4x + 8y = 72 \\)\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 4:\n\n\\( x + 2y = 18 \\)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 12 \\)\n\n2. \\( x + 2y = 18 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\( (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 18 - 12 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( x + 2y - x - y = 6 \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\( y = 6 \\)\n\nThen, substitute back into the first equation:\n\n\\( x + 6 = 12 \\)\n\nThus:\n\n\\( x = 6 \\)\n\nAgain, we get the same result: 6 pounds of each type of candy.\n\nJust to explore another approach, let's consider using ratios or weighted averages, since it's a mixture problem.\n\nThe average cost per pound of the mixture is \\( \\frac{72}{12} = 6 \\) dollars per pound.\n\nNow, type A is $4 per pound, and type B is $8 per pound. The average is $6, which is right in the middle, suggesting equal parts of both types, which aligns with our earlier result of 6 pounds each.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the rule of alligation, but that might be a bit more complicated for this scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, the customer bought 6 pounds of type A candy and 6 pounds of type B candy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ pounds of type A and } 6 \\text{ pounds of type B}} \\]"
