        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, making a total of 12 balls. I need to find the probability that if I pick two balls at once without looking, both of them are red.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to pick two balls \"at once.\" I think this means that the order in which I pick the balls doesn't matter, and I'm not replacing one ball before picking the second. So, it's a situation where I'm choosing two balls simultaneously from the box.\n\nProbability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to pick two red balls, and the total possible outcomes are all the ways to pick any two balls from the box.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the total number of ways to pick two balls from 12. Since the order doesn't matter, I should use combinations, not permutations. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose two balls from 12 is:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12!}{2!(12 - 2)!} = \\frac{12!}{2! \\times 10!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 10! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(12, 2) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 10!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 66 possible ways to choose two balls from the box.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of ways to choose two red balls from the five available. Again, since order doesn't matter, I'll use combinations:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2! \\times 3!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 favorable ways to pick two red balls.\n\nNow, the probability that both balls are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{10}{66} = \\frac{5}{33}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, can I simplify this fraction further? Let's see. 10 divided by 2 is 5, and 66 divided by 2 is 33, so yes, \\( \\frac{10}{66} = \\frac{5}{33} \\). I don't think this can be simplified further because 5 and 33 have no common factors other than 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this problem step by step, considering the probability of picking one red ball and then another red ball without replacement.\n\nFirst, the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw. There are 5 red balls out of 12 total balls, so:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{first red}) = \\frac{5}{12}\n\\]\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 11 balls left in the box. So, the probability of picking another red ball is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{second red} | \\text{first red}) = \\frac{4}{11}\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I multiply these probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{5}{12} \\times \\frac{4}{11} = \\frac{20}{132} = \\frac{5}{33}\n\\]\n\nOkay, this matches the answer I got using combinations. So, both methods confirm that the probability is \\( \\frac{5}{33} \\).\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, could I calculate the probability by considering the blue balls?\n\nSuppose I calculate the probability that both balls are blue and then subtract that from 1, along with the probability of picking one red and one blue, but that seems more complicated. Let's see:\n\nFirst, the probability that both balls are blue. There are 7 blue balls, so:\n\n\\[\nC(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7 - 2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of both balls being blue is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both blue}) = \\frac{21}{66} = \\frac{7}{22}\n\\]\n\nThen, the probability of picking one red and one blue ball would be:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one red and one blue}) = 1 - P(\\text{both red}) - P(\\text{both blue})\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, the total probabilities should add up as follows:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) + P(\\text{both blue}) + P(\\text{one red and one blue}) = 1\n\\]\n\nBut I think calculating \\( P(\\text{one red and one blue}) \\) directly might be unnecessary for this problem since I'm only asked for \\( P(\\text{both red}) \\), which I've already found using two different methods.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate \\( P(\\text{one red and one blue}) \\) as:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one red and one blue}) = \\frac{C(5, 1) \\times C(7, 1)}{C(12, 2)} = \\frac{5 \\times 7}{66} = \\frac{35}{66}\n\\]\n\nThen, confirming:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both red}) + P(\\text{both blue}) + P(\\text{one red and one blue}) = \\frac{10}{66} + \\frac{21}{66} + \\frac{35}{66} = \\frac{66}{66} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis checks out, so everything is consistent.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. The probability that both balls picked are red is \\( \\frac{5}{33} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]"
