        "content": "Let's see. The factory currently produces 200 widgets per hour. They're planning to increase production by 25%. I need to find out how many widgets they'll produce in one day after this increase.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what a 25% increase on 200 widgets per hour means. To calculate 25% of 200, I can multiply 200 by 0.25.\n\n200 * 0.25 = 50\n\nSo, the production will increase by 50 widgets per hour. Therefore, the new production rate will be:\n\n200 + 50 = 250 widgets per hour\n\nNow, I need to find out how many widgets are produced in one day. Assuming the factory operates 24 hours a day, I can multiply the hourly production by 24.\n\n250 * 24 = 6,000\n\nTherefore, after the increase, the factory will produce 6,000 widgets in one day.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? For example, do they take breaks or have downtime in their operation? The problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I'll assume they operate continuously for 24 hours.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that my calculations are correct. Let me double-check:\n\nOriginal production: 200 widgets/hour\n\nIncrease: 25% of 200 = 50 widgets/hour\n\nNew production rate: 200 + 50 = 250 widgets/hour\n\nWidgets in one day: 250 * 24 = 6,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the factory will produce 6,000 widgets in one day after the production increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
