He is the offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon and is often depicted as having three heads, a serpent's tail, and a mane of snakes. Cerberus's primary role is to guard the gates of the underworld, ensuring that the souls of the deceased cannot escape and that living beings do not enter without permission. His fierce nature and multiple heads symbolize his ability to watch all directions simultaneously, making him an effective guardian."
