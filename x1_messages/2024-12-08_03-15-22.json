        "content": "The equator is approximately 24,901 miles long. If I were to walk non-stop at an average speed of 3 miles per hour, the time it would take can be calculated by dividing the total distance by the speed.\n\nSo, time = distance / speed = 24,901 miles / 3 miles per hour.\n\nLet me do the math: that's 24,901 divided by 3, which is roughly 8,300.333 hours.\n\nBut that's a big number. Let's convert it into days and hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:\n\nTotal days = total hours / 24 = 8,300.333 / 24 \u2248 345.847 days.\n\nSo, it would take approximately 345 days and about 20 hours to walk the entire length of the equator non-stop at 3 miles per hour.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit short. Maybe I should check my calculations again.\n\nLet's see: 24,901 miles divided by 3 miles per hour is indeed approximately 8,300.333 hours.\n\nNow, 8,300.333 hours divided by 24 hours per day equals approximately 345.847 days, which is roughly 345 days and 20 hours.\n\nHmm, but walking non-stop for that long seems unrealistic, but since the question assumes non-stop walking, that's the theoretical time.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider walking 24 hours a day without breaks, which is what non-stop implies, then yes, it would take about 345 days and 20 hours.\n\nBut in reality, people need sleep and rest, so in practice, it would take much longer. But since the question specifies non-stop, we'll go with the theoretical calculation.\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 345 days and 20 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{345 \\text{ days and } 20 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
