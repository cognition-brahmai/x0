        "content": "Let's see. The car rental company has 20 cars in total. If 60% of them are rented out, I need to find out how many cars are still available.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cars are rented. To do that, I can calculate 60% of 20. \n\nI know that 60% is the same as 60 divided by 100, which is 0.6. So, I can multiply 0.6 by 20 to find the number of rented cars.\n\n0.6 times 20 is 12. So, 12 cars are rented out.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are still available, I can subtract the number of rented cars from the total number of cars.\n\nThat is, 20 minus 12 equals 8.\n\nSo, there are 8 cars still available.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the percentage of cars that are still available. If 60% are rented, then 40% are not rented, right?\n\nBecause 100% minus 60% is 40%.\n\nSo, if 40% of the cars are available, I can calculate 40% of 20.\n\nAgain, 40% is 0.4, and 0.4 times 20 is 8.\n\nSo, that matches my previous result. So, definitely, there are 8 cars still available.\n\nAlternatively, I could use fractions. 60% is the same as 3/5, since 60 divided by 20 is 3, and 100 divided by 20 is 5.\n\nSo, 3/5 of the cars are rented. Therefore, the number of rented cars is 3/5 times 20, which is 12.\n\nThen, 20 minus 12 is again 8.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 8 as the number of available cars.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the number of available cars.\n\nFor example, are there any cars that are unavailable for rent but not rented out, like maybe they are broken or being serviced? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I assume all cars are either rented or available.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there are any other factors to consider.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 8 cars are still available.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
