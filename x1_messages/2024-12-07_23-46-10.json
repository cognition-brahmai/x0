        "content": "I'm here to help you with this problem. It seems like the hospital is trying to make the best use of its $25 million budget to upgrade its medical equipment over the next five years. There are four categories of equipment: diagnostic machines, surgical tools, patient monitoring systems, and laboratory instruments, each with their own costs. The goal is to maximize the overall improvement in healthcare services.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"maximize overall improvement in healthcare services\" means. Since this isn't specified, I'll assume that more equipment in each category leads to better services, but there might be diminishing returns or different priorities across categories. Without specific metrics for improvement, I'll have to make some assumptions.\n\nLet's list out the costs for each type of equipment:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: $2 million each\n\n- Surgical tools: $500,000 per set\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: $100,000 each\n\n- Laboratory instruments: $50,000 each\n\nThe total budget is $25 million, which needs to be allocated among these four categories.\n\nSince there are four categories, one approach could be to divide the budget equally among them. But that might not be the most optimal way, as different types of equipment may have different impacts on healthcare services.\n\nAnother approach is to prioritize based on need or impact. For example, if diagnostic machines are more critical for patient care, they might get a larger share of the budget.\n\nHowever, without specific data on the current status and future needs of each category, it's challenging to determine the exact allocation. Perhaps the hospital has assessed its needs and has a list of how many of each type of equipment it wants to upgrade.\n\nLet's assume that the hospital has provided some\u9700\u6c42 or projected usage for each category. For instance:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: need to upgrade 5 machines\n\n- Surgical tools: need to upgrade 10 sets\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: need to upgrade 50 systems\n\n- Laboratory instruments: need to upgrade 100 instruments\n\nUsing these numbers, we can calculate the total cost for each category:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 5 * $2 million = $10 million\n\n- Surgical tools: 10 * $500,000 = $5 million\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 50 * $100,000 = $5 million\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 100 * $50,000 = $5 million\n\nTotal cost: $10 million + $5 million + $5 million + $5 million = $25 million\n\nThis matches the total budget exactly. In this case, the allocation would be:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: $10 million\n\n- Surgical tools: $5 million\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: $5 million\n\n- Laboratory instruments: $5 million\n\nBut wait a minute, perhaps the hospital doesn't have specific numbers for each category. Maybe it just knows the total budget and the costs per item, and needs to decide how many of each to buy to maximize overall improvement.\n\nIn that case, we might need to assign some kind of utility or benefit to each type of equipment. For example, each diagnostic machine provides a certain level of improvement, each set of surgical tools provides another level, and so on.\n\nLet's assume that we can assign a benefit score to each type of equipment. For instance:\n\n- Each diagnostic machine provides a benefit of 100 units\n\n- Each set of surgical tools provides a benefit of 50 units\n\n- Each patient monitoring system provides a benefit of 20 units\n\n- Each laboratory instrument provides a benefit of 10 units\n\nThese are arbitrary numbers, but they help in illustrating the point.\n\nGiven these benefit units, we can calculate the cost per benefit unit for each type of equipment:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: $2 million per 100 units = $20,000 per unit\n\n- Surgical tools: $500,000 per 50 units = $10,000 per unit\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: $100,000 per 20 units = $5,000 per unit\n\n- Laboratory instruments: $50,000 per 10 units = $5,000 per unit\n\nInteresting, both patient monitoring systems and laboratory instruments have the same cost per benefit unit.\n\nIn this scenario, to maximize the total benefit, we should prioritize buying the equipment with the lowest cost per benefit unit.\n\nSo, patient monitoring systems and laboratory instruments are the most cost-effective, followed by surgical tools, and then diagnostic machines.\n\nTherefore, to maximize overall improvement, the hospital should allocate as much budget as possible to patient monitoring systems and laboratory instruments.\n\nHowever, there might be practical constraints. For example, the hospital might have a minimum number of diagnostic machines that need to be upgraded, regardless of cost per benefit.\n\nAlternatively, there might be dependencies. Perhaps having more diagnostic machines is necessary to fully utilize the surgical tools or laboratory instruments.\n\nWithout such constraints, the purely economic approach would suggest allocating the budget primarily to patient monitoring systems and laboratory instruments.\n\nLet's see how that would look.\n\nTotal budget: $25 million\n\nCost per patient monitoring system: $100,000\n\nCost per laboratory instrument: $50,000\n\nSince both have the same cost per benefit unit, we can allocate the budget between them as needed.\n\nNumber of patient monitoring systems: $25 million / $100,000 = 250 systems\n\nNumber of laboratory instruments: $25 million / $50,000 = 500 instruments\n\nTotal benefit:\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 250 * 20 = 5,000 units\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 500 * 10 = 5,000 units\n\n- Total: 10,000 units\n\nBut this might not be practical, as the hospital might not need or have space for 250 new monitoring systems or 500 new lab instruments.\n\nAlternatively, a balanced approach might be better.\n\nLet's consider allocating the budget proportionally across all categories.\n\nTotal budget: $25 million\n\nNumber of categories: 4\n\nEqual allocation: $25 million / 4 = $6.25 million per category\n\nNow, see how many items can be bought in each category with $6.25 million.\n\n- Diagnostic machines: $6.25 million / $2 million \u2248 3.125 \u2192 3 machines ($6 million)\n\n- Surgical tools: $6.25 million / $500,000 = 12.5 \u2192 12 sets ($6 million)\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: $6.25 million / $100,000 = 62.5 \u2192 62 systems ($6.2 million)\n\n- Laboratory instruments: $6.25 million / $50,000 = 125 \u2192 125 instruments ($6.25 million)\n\nTotal cost: $6 million + $6 million + $6.2 million + $6.25 million = $24.45 million\n\nRemaining budget: $25 million - $24.45 million = $0.55 million\n\nThis remaining budget can be allocated to the category with the best cost per benefit unit, which are patient monitoring systems and laboratory instruments.\n\nWith $0.55 million, we can buy:\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: $0.55 million / $100,000 = 5.5 \u2192 5 systems ($0.5 million)\n\n- Remaining: $0.05 million, which is not enough for another monitoring system or laboratory instrument.\n\nSo, total allocation:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 3 machines ($6 million)\n\n- Surgical tools: 12 sets ($6 million)\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 67 systems ($6.7 million)\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 125 instruments ($6.25 million)\n\nTotal cost: $6 million + $6 million + $6.7 million + $6.25 million = $24.95 million\n\nRemaining: $0.05 million, which can be saved or allocated to another category.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total benefit:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 3 * 100 = 300 units\n\n- Surgical tools: 12 * 50 = 600 units\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 67 * 20 = 1,340 units\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 125 * 10 = 1,250 units\n\n- Total benefit: 300 + 600 + 1,340 + 1,250 = 3,490 units\n\nAlternatively, if we allocate more to patient monitoring systems and laboratory instruments, we might get a higher total benefit.\n\nFor example, allocate $10 million to patient monitoring systems and $10 million to laboratory instruments, and $2.5 million each to diagnostic machines and surgical tools.\n\n- Diagnostic machines: $2.5 million / $2 million \u2248 1.25 \u2192 1 machine ($2 million)\n\n- Surgical tools: $2.5 million / $500,000 = 5 sets ($2.5 million)\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: $10 million / $100,000 = 100 systems ($10 million)\n\n- Laboratory instruments: $10 million / $50,000 = 200 instruments ($10 million)\n\nTotal cost: $2 million + $2.5 million + $10 million + $10 million = $24.5 million\n\nRemaining: $0.5 million, which can be allocated to patient monitoring systems or laboratory instruments.\n\nTotal benefit:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 1 * 100 = 100 units\n\n- Surgical tools: 5 * 50 = 250 units\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 100 * 20 = 2,000 units\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 200 * 10 = 2,000 units\n\n- Total: 4,350 units\n\nThis is higher than the previous total benefit of 3,490 units.\n\nHowever, this allocation might not be practical, as the hospital might need more diagnostic machines or surgical tools to maintain its operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are dependencies between the categories. For example, each surgical tool set requires a certain number of patient monitoring systems.\n\nWithout specific information on such dependencies or the hospital's priorities, it's challenging to determine the optimal allocation.\n\nAnother approach is to use linear programming to maximize the total benefit given the budget constraint.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- x1 = number of diagnostic machines\n\n- x2 = number of surgical tool sets\n\n- x3 = number of patient monitoring systems\n\n- x4 = number of laboratory instruments\n\nObjective function: maximize Z = 100x1 + 50x2 + 20x3 + 10x4\n\nSubject to:\n\n2,000,000 x1 + 500,000 x2 + 100,000 x3 + 50,000 x4 \u2264 25,000,000\n\nAnd x1, x2, x3, x4 \u2265 0 and integer\n\nThis is a linear programming problem that can be solved using software or algorithms like the simplex method.\n\nHowever, since this is a theoretical exercise, I'll try to reason through it.\n\nGiven the cost per benefit unit, it's most cost-effective to maximize x3 and x4, then x2, and finally x1.\n\nSo, to maximize Z, we should buy as many x3 and x4 as possible within the budget.\n\nFirst, calculate how many x3 and x4 can be bought with the entire budget.\n\nCost per x3: $100,000, benefit per x3: 20 units, cost per unit: $5,000 per unit\n\nCost per x4: $50,000, benefit per x4: 10 units, cost per unit: $5,000 per unit\n\nSince both x3 and x4 have the same cost per unit benefit, we can allocate equally between them or based on availability.\n\nHowever, x4 is cheaper in terms of dollar amount, so we can buy more of x4 for the same money.\n\nBut since x3 has higher benefit per item, it might be better to buy more x3.\n\nWait, no, since cost per benefit unit is the same, it doesn't matter which one we choose.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of units, we can buy more of x4 because they are cheaper.\n\nFor example, with $25 million:\n\n- All x4: $25 million / $50,000 = 500 instruments, benefit = 500 * 10 = 5,000 units\n\n- All x3: $25 million / $100,000 = 250 systems, benefit = 250 * 20 = 5,000 units\n\nSo, same total benefit.\n\nHowever, perhaps having a mix of both is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hospital has space or usage constraints for each type of equipment.\n\nWithout specific constraints, the optimal allocation in terms of maximum benefit would be to spend the entire budget on either x3 or x4, or a combination that maintains the same total benefit.\n\nBut again, this might not be practical.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to set minimum requirements for each category and then allocate the remaining budget based on cost-effectiveness.\n\nFor example, the hospital might decide that it needs at least 2 diagnostic machines, 5 surgical tool sets, 20 patient monitoring systems, and 50 laboratory instruments.\n\nThen, allocate the remaining budget to the most cost-effective options.\n\nLet's calculate the cost of these minimum requirements:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 2 * $2 million = $4 million\n\n- Surgical tools: 5 * $500,000 = $2.5 million\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 20 * $100,000 = $2 million\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 50 * $50,000 = $2.5 million\n\nTotal: $4 million + $2.5 million + $2 million + $2.5 million = $11 million\n\nRemaining budget: $25 million - $11 million = $14 million\n\nNow, allocate the remaining $14 million to the most cost-effective options, which are x3 and x4.\n\nSince both have the same cost per benefit unit, we can allocate equally or based on availability.\n\nFor example, allocate $7 million to x3 and $7 million to x4.\n\n- x3: $7 million / $100,000 = 70 systems\n\n- x4: $7 million / $50,000 = 140 instruments\n\nTotal benefit from minimum requirements:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 2 * 100 = 200 units\n\n- Surgical tools: 5 * 50 = 250 units\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 20 * 20 = 400 units\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 50 * 10 = 500 units\n\nTotal: 200 + 250 + 400 + 500 = 1,350 units\n\nAdditional benefit from extra allocation:\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 70 * 20 = 1,400 units\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 140 * 10 = 1,400 units\n\nTotal additional benefit: 1,400 + 1,400 = 2,800 units\n\nTotal benefit: 1,350 + 2,800 = 4,150 units\n\nThis is higher than the previous allocations.\n\nAlternatively, if we allocate more to x4 due to lower cost:\n\n- x4: $14 million / $50,000 = 280 instruments\n\nBenefit: 280 * 10 = 2,800 units\n\nTotal benefit: 1,350 + 2,800 = 4,150 units\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, allocate all remaining budget to x3:\n\n- x3: $14 million / $100,000 = 140 systems\n\nBenefit: 140 * 20 = 2,800 units\n\nTotal benefit: 1,350 + 2,800 = 4,150 units\n\nAgain, same total benefit.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it doesn't matter how we allocate the remaining budget between x3 and x4, as long as we prioritize them over x1 and x2.\n\nHowever, perhaps there are upper limits on how many of each type of equipment the hospital can accommodate.\n\nFor example, maybe the hospital only has space for 100 patient monitoring systems.\n\nIn that case, we can't buy more than 100.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps there are only a certain number of lab instruments needed.\n\nWithout specific constraints, it's hard to pin down the exact allocation.\n\nAnother consideration is the current state of each category.\n\nIf, for example, the hospital's diagnostic machines are severely outdated and critically need upgrading, it might make sense to allocate a larger portion of the budget to that category, even if the cost per benefit unit is higher.\n\nSimilarly, if the laboratory instruments are relatively new, fewer need to be upgraded.\n\nTherefore, perhaps a needs assessment is necessary.\n\nLet's assume that the hospital has conducted such an assessment and has determined the following priorities:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: high priority, need to upgrade at least 4 machines\n\n- Surgical tools: medium priority, need to upgrade 8 sets\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: medium priority, need to upgrade 40 systems\n\n- Laboratory instruments: low priority, need to upgrade 60 instruments\n\nBased on this, we can set minimum requirements:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 4 * $2 million = $8 million\n\n- Surgical tools: 8 * $500,000 = $4 million\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 40 * $100,000 = $4 million\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 60 * $50,000 = $3 million\n\nTotal: $8 million + $4 million + $4 million + $3 million = $19 million\n\nRemaining budget: $25 million - $19 million = $6 million\n\nNow, allocate the remaining $6 million to the most cost-effective options, which are x3 and x4.\n\nGiven that x3 and x4 have the same cost per benefit unit, we can allocate the remaining budget to either or both.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Additional patient monitoring systems: $6 million / $100,000 = 60 systems\n\n- Additional laboratory instruments: $6 million / $50,000 = 120 instruments\n\nAlternatively, a combination, such as 30 systems and 60 instruments, costing $3 million + $3 million = $6 million.\n\nTotal allocation:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 4 machines ($8 million)\n\n- Surgical tools: 8 sets ($4 million)\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 40 + 60 = 100 systems ($4 million + $6 million = $10 million)\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 60 + 120 = 180 instruments ($3 million + $6 million = $9 million)\n\nTotal cost: $8 million + $4 million + $10 million + $9 million = $31 million\n\nWait, that exceeds the budget of $25 million.\n\nI must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the minimum requirements already sum to $19 million, and the additional allocation is $6 million, but $19 million + $6 million = $25 million, not $31 million.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the costs.\n\nLet's double-check:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 4 * $2 million = $8 million\n\n- Surgical tools: 8 * $500,000 = $4 million\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 40 * $100,000 = $4 million\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 60 * $50,000 = $3 million\n\nTotal: $8 million + $4 million + $4 million + $3 million = $19 million\n\nRemaining budget: $25 million - $19 million = $6 million\n\nAdditional patient monitoring systems: 60 systems * $100,000 = $6 million\n\nAdditional laboratory instruments: 120 instruments * $50,000 = $6 million\n\nSo, if we choose to allocate the entire remaining $6 million to patient monitoring systems, we can buy 60 more systems, bringing the total to 100 systems.\n\nAlternatively, if we allocate it to laboratory instruments, we can buy 120 more instruments, bringing the total to 180 instruments.\n\nOr any combination in between.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total benefit:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 4 * 100 = 400 units\n\n- Surgical tools: 8 * 50 = 400 units\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 100 * 20 = 2,000 units\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 60 * 10 = 600 units\n\nTotal benefit: 400 + 400 + 2,000 + 600 = 3,400 units\n\nAlternatively, if we allocate the remaining $6 million to laboratory instruments:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 4 * 100 = 400 units\n\n- Surgical tools: 8 * 50 = 400 units\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 40 * 20 = 800 units\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 180 * 10 = 1,800 units\n\nTotal benefit: 400 + 400 + 800 + 1,800 = 3,400 units\n\nSame total benefit.\n\nAlternatively, a combination:\n\n- Additional patient monitoring systems: 30 * $100,000 = $3 million\n\n- Additional laboratory instruments: 60 * $50,000 = $3 million\n\nTotal additional cost: $3 million + $3 million = $6 million\n\nTotal allocation:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 4 machines ($8 million)\n\n- Surgical tools: 8 sets ($4 million)\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 40 + 30 = 70 systems ($4 million + $3 million = $7 million)\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 60 + 60 = 120 instruments ($3 million + $3 million = $6 million)\n\nTotal cost: $8 million + $4 million + $7 million + $6 million = $25 million\n\nTotal benefit:\n\n- Diagnostic machines: 4 * 100 = 400 units\n\n- Surgical tools: 8 * 50 = 400 units\n\n- Patient monitoring systems: 70 * 20 = 1,400 units\n\n- Laboratory instruments: 120 * 10 = 1,200 units\n\n- Total: 400 + 400 + 1,400 + 1,200 = 3,400 units\n\nAgain, same total benefit.\n\nSo, in this scenario, regardless of how we allocate the remaining budget between x3 and x4, the total benefit remains the same.\n\nHowever, perhaps there are diminishing returns. Maybe the first set of equipment provides more benefit than additional sets.\n\nIf that's the case, then prioritizing the categories with higher initial benefit would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are synergies between different types of equipment.\n\nFor example, adding more diagnostic machines might require additional surgical tools or patient monitoring systems to fully utilize them.\n\nWithout specific information on such interactions, it's difficult to determine the optimal allocation.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the hospital's strategic goals.\n\nFor instance, if the hospital is focusing on improving patient care in the ICU, then patient monitoring systems might be a higher priority.\n\nAlternatively, if the hospital is expanding its surgical services, then surgical tools and diagnostic machines might be more important.\n\nWithout specific strategic goals, I'll assume that the hospital wants a balanced approach.\n\nGiven that, perhaps allocating the budget proportionally based on the cost per benefit unit could be a good strategy.\n\nSince x3 and x4 have the same cost per benefit unit, and x2 has a lower cost per benefit unit than x1, perhaps allocate more to x2, x3, and x4, with a smaller portion to x1.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Allocate $10 million to x3 and x4 combined\n\n- Allocate $7 million to x2\n\n- Allocate $8 million to x1\n\nNow, calculate the number of items:\n\n- x1: $8 million / $2 million = 4 machines\n\n- x2: $7 million / $500,000 = 14 sets\n\n- x3: $5 million / $100,000 = 50 systems\n\n- x4: $5 million / $50,000 = 100 instruments\n\nTotal cost: $8 million + $7 million + $5 million + $5 million = $25 million\n\nTotal benefit:\n\n- x1: 4 * 100 = 400 units\n\n- x2: 14 * 50 = 700 units\n\n- x3: 50 * 20 = 1,000 units\n\n- x4: 100 * 10 = 1,000 units\n\n- Total: 400 + 700 + 1,000 + 1,000 = 3,100 units\n\nComparing to previous allocations, this gives a lower total benefit of 3,100 units versus 3,400 units.\n\nTherefore, it's not as efficient.\n\nAlternatively, allocate less to x1 and more to x3 and x4.\n\nFor example:\n\n- x1: $5 million / $2 million \u2248 2.5 \u2192 2 machines ($4 million)\n\n- x2: $5 million / $500,000 = 10 sets ($5 million)\n\n- x3: $10 million / $100,000 = 100 systems ($10 million)\n\n- x4: $6 million / $50,000 = 120 instruments ($6 million)\n\nTotal cost: $4 million + $5 million + $10 million + $6 million = $25 million\n\nTotal benefit:\n\n- x1: 2 * 100 = 200 units\n\n- x2: 10 * 50 = 500 units\n\n- x3: 100 * 20 = 2,000 units\n\n- x4: 120 * 10 = 1,200 units\n\n- Total: 200 + 500 + 2,000 + 1,200 = 3,900 units\n\nThis is higher than previous allocations.\n\nHowever, perhaps the hospital needs at least a certain number of diagnostic machines to maintain its services.\n\nIf the hospital needs at least 3 diagnostic machines, then:\n\n- x1: 3 machines ($6 million)\n\n- x2: $5 million / $500,000 = 10 sets ($5 million)\n\n- x3: $10 million / $100,000 = 100 systems ($10 million)\n\n- x4: $4 million / $50,000 = 80 instruments ($4 million)\n\nTotal cost: $6 million + $5 million + $10 million + $4 million = $25 million\n\nTotal benefit:\n\n- x1: 3 * 100 = 300 units\n\n- x2: 10 * 50 = 500 units\n\n- x3: 100 * 20 = 2,000 units\n\n- x4: 80 * 10 = 800 units\n\n- Total: 300 + 500 + 2,000 + 800 = 3,600 units\n\nThis is lower than the previous allocation of 3,900 units.\n\nTherefore, allocating fewer diagnostic machines allows for a higher total benefit.\n\nHowever, the hospital might have constraints on the minimum number of each type of equipment needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the benefit units aren't additive in this way.\n\nMaybe there are interactions between the different types of equipment.\n\nFor example, each diagnostic machine requires a certain number of patient monitoring systems to be fully effective.\n\nIn that case, the benefits wouldn't be independent.\n\nWithout specific information on such interactions, it's challenging to model this accurately.\n\nAnother consideration is the lifespan of the equipment.\n\nIf some equipment has a shorter lifespan, it might need to be replaced sooner, which could affect the long-term planning.\n\nHowever, since the hospital is planning for the next five years, and assuming all equipment will last at least that long, this might not be a concern.\n\nAdditionally, there might be maintenance costs associated with each type of equipment, which aren't accounted for in this analysis.\n\nBut given the information provided, I'll proceed with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that, the optimal allocation seems to be:\n\n- Allocate as much as possible to patient monitoring systems and laboratory instruments, while meeting any minimum requirements for diagnostic machines and surgical tools.\n\nThis would maximize the total benefit in terms of the arbitrary units defined.\n\nHowever, in practice, the hospital would need to consider other factors such as space constraints, staff training requirements, and the specific needs of its patient population.\n\nMoreover, the benefit units I assigned are hypothetical and would need to be replaced with actual metrics reflecting the true value of each type of equipment.\n\nIn conclusion, without specific constraints or priorities, it's not possible to determine a single optimal allocation.\n\nHowever, based on the cost per benefit unit, allocating the majority of the budget to patient monitoring systems and laboratory instruments would maximize the overall improvement in healthcare services.\n\nBut, to be realistic, the hospital should also consider the minimum requirements and strategic goals when making the final decision.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Allocate as much as possible to patient monitoring systems and laboratory instruments while meeting minimum requirements for diagnostic machines and surgical tools to maximize overall improvement in healthcare services.}}"
