So, first, I need to find out how many people are wearing glasses.\n\nTo find 40% of 100, I can calculate:\n\n40% \u00d7 100 = 0.4 \u00d7 100 = 40\n\nSo, 40 people are wearing glasses.\n\nNow, out of these 40 people wearing glasses, 30% also have a hat on. I need to find out how many people that is.\n\nTo find 30% of 40, I can calculate:\n\n30% \u00d7 40 = 0.3 \u00d7 40 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 people are wearing both glasses and a hat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
