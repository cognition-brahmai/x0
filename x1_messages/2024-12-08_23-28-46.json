        "content": "So, there are 100 houses in the village, and each house has a number of candies equal to its house number. That means house number 1 has 1 candy, house 2 has 2 candies, and this pattern continues up to house 100, which has 100 candies.\n\nThe question is asking for the total number of candies in the even-numbered houses. So, we need to add up the candies in houses 2, 4, 6, ..., up to house 100.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the even-numbered houses. Since house numbers are from 1 to 100, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a_1 is 2, the common difference d is 2, and the last term a_n is 100.\n\nTo find the number of even-numbered houses, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n100 = 2 + (n - 1) * 2\n\nLet's solve for n:\n\n100 = 2 + 2(n - 1)\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n98 = 2(n - 1)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n49 = n - 1\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\nn = 50\n\nSo, there are 50 even-numbered houses.\n\nNow, to find the total number of candies in these even-numbered houses, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nHere, n is 50, a_1 is 2, and a_n is 100.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS_50 = 50/2 * (2 + 100) = 25 * 102 = 2550\n\nTherefore, the even-numbered houses have a total of 2550 candies.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of this as the sum of the first 100 natural numbers minus the sum of the odd-numbered houses.\n\nThe sum of the first 100 natural numbers is:\n\nS = 100 * 101 / 2 = 5050\n\nThe sum of the odd-numbered houses can be calculated similarly. The odd numbers from 1 to 99 form another arithmetic sequence with a_1 = 1, d = 2, and a_n = 99.\n\nFirst, find the number of terms:\n\n99 = 1 + (n - 1) * 2\n\n99 = 1 + 2n - 2\n\n99 = 2n - 1\n\n100 = 2n\n\nn = 50\n\nSo, there are 50 odd-numbered houses.\n\nSum of odd-numbered houses:\n\nS_50 = 50/2 * (1 + 99) = 25 * 100 = 2500\n\nTherefore, the sum of even-numbered houses is:\n\nTotal sum - sum of odd-numbered houses = 5050 - 2500 = 2550\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to note that the sum of even numbers from 2 to 100 is equal to 2 times the sum of the first 50 natural numbers.\n\nSum = 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 100 = 2*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 50)\n\nThe sum of the first 50 natural numbers is:\n\nS = 50 * 51 / 2 = 1275\n\nTherefore, sum of even-numbered houses is:\n\n2 * 1275 = 2550\n\nAgain, this confirms our previous result.\n\nSo, the total number of candies in the even-numbered houses is 2550.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2550} \\]"
