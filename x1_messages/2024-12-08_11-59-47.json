        "content": "Certainly! Below is a C++ function that takes an integer array and its size as inputs, reverses the elements of the array, and returns the reversed array.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\n// Function to reverse the array\nint* reverseArray(int arr[], int size) {\n    int* reversed = new int[size];\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        reversed[i] = arr[size - 1 - i];\n    }\n    return reversed;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int originalArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    int size = sizeof(originalArray) / sizeof(originalArray[0]);\n\n    int* reversedArray = reverseArray(originalArray, size);\n\n    std::cout << \"Reversed Array: \";\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        std::cout << reversedArray[i] << \" \";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    // Don't forget to free the allocated memory\n    delete[] reversedArray;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - `int* reverseArray(int arr[], int size)`: This function takes an integer array and its size as parameters and returns a pointer to the reversed array.\n\n2. **Reversing the Array**:\n   - A new integer array `reversed` is dynamically allocated with the same size as the input array.\n   - The elements are copied from the input array in reverse order to the `reversed` array.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - An example array `originalArray` is defined and its size is calculated.\n   - The `reverseArray` function is called with this array and its size.\n   - The reversed array is printed.\n   - Finally, the dynamically allocated array is deleted to free the memory.\n\nThis approach ensures that the original array remains unchanged, and a new reversed array is created and returned."
