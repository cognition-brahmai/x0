        "content": "Sure, I can guide you through creating a Node.js application that connects to an AWS S3 bucket, lists all objects within the bucket, and prints their names and sizes. To achieve this, you'll need to set up an AWS S3 bucket and configure your AWS credentials properly.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **AWS Account**: Make sure you have an AWS account and an S3 bucket set up.\n2. **AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables or by using the AWS CLI.\n3. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Project\n\nFirst, create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js project.\n\n```bash\nmkdir s3-list-objects\ncd s3-list-objects\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Required Packages\n\nYou'll need the `aws-sdk` package to interact with AWS S3.\n\n```bash\nnpm install aws-sdk\n```\n\n### Step 3: Configure AWS Credentials\n\nEnsure that your AWS credentials are configured correctly. You can set them up using the AWS CLI:\n\n```bash\naws configure\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set environment variables:\n\n```bash\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key\nexport AWS_REGION=your-region\n```\n\n### Step 4: Write the Node.js Code\n\nCreate a new file, e.g., `listS3Objects.js`, and add the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst AWS = require('aws-sdk');\n\n// Configure the region\nAWS.config.update({ region: 'your-region' });\n\n// Create S3 service object\nconst s3 = new AWS.S3({ apiVersion: '2006-03-01' });\n\n// Call S3 to list buckets\ns3.listObjectsV2({ Bucket: 'your-bucket-name' }, (err, data) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(\"Error listing objects:\", err);\n  } else {\n    data.Contents.forEach((object) => {\n      console.log(`Object Key: ${object.Key}, Size: ${object.Size} bytes`);\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Step 5: Run Your Application\n\nExecute your script using Node.js:\n\n```bash\nnode listS3Objects.js\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **AWS Configuration**: Set up the AWS region in the configuration.\n2. **S3 Service Object**: Create an S3 service object.\n3. **List Objects**: Use the `listObjectsV2` method to list objects in the specified bucket.\n4. **Handle Response**: Log the key and size of each object.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Replace `'your-region'` and `'your-bucket-name'` with your actual AWS region and S3 bucket name.\n- Ensure that the IAM user or role associated with your credentials has the necessary permissions to list objects in the S3 bucket.\n- For larger buckets, consider implementing pagination using the `ContinuationToken`.\n\nThis should give you a basic Node.js application that lists all objects in an S3 bucket and prints their names and sizes.
