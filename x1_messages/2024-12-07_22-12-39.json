        "content": "Let's see. There are 5 people, each with a different number of apples, and together they have 20 apples. I need to figure out how many apples the person with the most has left after giving half to the person with the least.\n\nFirst, since each person has a different number of apples, I should think about possible distributions of apples that add up to 20.\n\nLet me list out possible numbers of apples each person could have. Since they all have different amounts, and assuming they each have at least one apple, the smallest possible amounts would start from 1 upwards.\n\nSo, the smallest distinct positive integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, which add up to 15. But the total is 20, so there are 5 extra apples to distribute.\n\nI need to distribute these 5 extra apples to these 5 people, but keeping their counts distinct. That means I can't just add 1 to each, because that would make them 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which adds to 20. That seems to work.\n\nSo, one possible distribution is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 apples.\n\nIn this case, the person with the most has 6 apples. If they give half to the person with the least, who has 2 apples, they give away 3 apples.\n\nSo, the person with the most would have 6 - 3 = 3 apples left.\n\nBut wait, now the person who received the apples has 2 + 3 = 5 apples.\n\nNow, the distribution would be 5, 3, 4, 5, 3. But this has duplicates (two people with 5 and two with 3), which violates the condition that each has a different number.\n\nSo, this can't be right. I must have made a mistake.\n\nMaybe the initial distribution isn't correct. Let's try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of apples each person has as a, b, c, d, e, where a < b < c < d < e.\n\nWe know that a + b + c + d + e = 20.\n\nAnd all are distinct positive integers.\n\nI need to find values for a, b, c, d, e that satisfy this.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the smallest possible for a, which is 1.\n\nThen b could be 2, c=3, d=4, e=10. But 1+2+3+4+10=20.\n\nIn this case, e=10. Half of 10 is 5, so e gives 5 to a.\n\nNow, e has 10 - 5 = 5 apples left.\n\nAnd a has 1 + 5 = 6 apples.\n\nNow the distribution is 6,2,3,4,5.\n\nWait, but now 6 > 5, which means the person who originally had the most now has 5, and the person who received the apples has 6.\n\nBut the question says \"the person with the most gives half to the person with the least.\"\n\nAfter giving, the person who gave would have e - e/2 = e/2 apples left.\n\nIn this case, e=10 -> e/2=5.\n\nSo, the person who gave has 5 left.\n\nBut now, someone else has more apples (a now has 6).\n\nBut perhaps the titles change after the transaction.\n\nWait, the question is: \"If the person with the most apples gives half of their apples to the person with the least apples, how many apples does the person with the most apples have left?\"\n\nSo, it's asking for how many apples the giver has left after giving half to the receiver.\n\nIn the example above, giver had 10, gives 5, so has 5 left.\n\nBut after that, someone else might have more, but the question is about the giver's amount after giving.\n\nSo, perhaps it's simply e/2, where e is the largest initial amount.\n\nBut I need to confirm if this is consistent across different possible distributions.\n\nLet me try another distribution.\n\nSuppose a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=9.\n\nTotal: 1+2+3+5+9=20.\n\nGiver has 9, gives half, which is 4.5, but since we're dealing with whole apples, perhaps I should assume apples are indivisible, and giving half means giving floor division.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume apples can be halved, or perhaps the problem implies whole numbers only.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of apples is such that half is always an integer.\n\nGiven that, in the first distribution I tried, e=10, gives 5, has 5 left.\n\nIn the second, e=9, gives 4.5, which is not integer, so maybe not valid.\n\nPerhaps all amounts must be integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implies that the half given is an integer.\n\nSo, e must be even.\n\nLet\u2019s assume e is even, so e/2 is integer.\n\nSo, in the first distribution, e=10, gives 5, has 5 left.\n\nIn another distribution, e=8, then gives 4, has 4 left.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\na=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=10, as before.\n\nAfter giving, e=5, a=6.\n\nBut now, the person who had the most originally has 5 left.\n\nBut in another distribution, say a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=8.\n\nTotal: 1+2+4+5+8=20.\n\nGiver has 8, gives half, which is 4, to a.\n\nSo, e has 8 - 4 = 4 left.\n\na has 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nNow, the distribution is a=5, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=4.\n\nWait, now a and d both have 5, which violates the distinct condition.\n\nSo, this can't be.\n\nMaybe another distribution: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=6, e=8.\n\nTotal: 1+2+3+6+8=20.\n\nGiver has 8, gives half, which is 4, to a.\n\nNow, e has 4 left.\n\na has 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nDistribution: a=5, b=2, c=3, d=6, e=4.\n\nNow, d has the most with 6.\n\nThe person who originally had the most now has 4.\n\nBut the question is about how many the original most has left after giving half.\n\nSo, in this case, 4.\n\nBut in the first distribution, it was 5.\n\nSo, it seems to depend on the initial distribution.\n\nIs there a way to find a unique answer, or does it vary based on the distribution?\n\nWait, maybe I need to find all possible distributions and see if the answer is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to determine the original largest amount.\n\nLet me think about the minimal possible for the smallest and the corresponding maximum for the largest.\n\nGiven that sums to 20, and all distinct positive integers.\n\nLet me try to minimize the largest by maximizing the others.\n\nIf a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, then e=10.\n\nIf a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, then e=9.\n\nIf a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, then e=8.\n\nIf a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, then e=7.\n\nIf a=2, b=3, c=4, d=5, then e=6.\n\nWait, but 2+3+4+5+6=20.\n\nSo, possible distributions are:\n\n1,2,3,4,10\n\n1,2,3,5,9\n\n1,2,4,5,8\n\n1,3,4,5,7\n\n2,3,4,5,6\n\nNow, in each of these, the largest is 10,9,8,7,6 respectively.\n\nNow, if the person with the most gives half to the person with the least:\n\n1. 1,2,3,4,10: gives 5 to 1, becomes 5 and 6, but then distribution is 6,2,3,4,5 (duplicates).\n\n2. 1,2,3,5,9: gives 4.5, but assuming integer, maybe not valid.\n\n3. 1,2,4,5,8: gives 4 to 1, becomes 5 and 4 (duplicates).\n\n4. 1,3,4,5,7: gives 3.5, not integer.\n\n5. 2,3,4,5,6: gives 3 to 2, becomes 3 and 5, distribution: 5,3,4,5,3 (duplicates).\n\nSo, in the first and fifth distributions, duplicates occur after transaction.\n\nIn the second and fourth, half is not integer.\n\nOnly the third distribution has integer halves, but still leads to duplicates.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to ensure that after transaction, all remain distinct.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that; it just asks for the number the original most has after giving half.\n\nSo, perhaps in each case, it's e/2.\n\nIn the first distribution, e=10, gives 5, has 5 left.\n\nIn the third distribution, e=8, gives 4, has 4 left.\n\nIn the fifth distribution, e=6, gives 3, has 3 left.\n\nSo, it varies based on e.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find e uniquely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that after giving, the counts remain distinct.\n\nLet me try to find a distribution where after transaction, all counts are distinct.\n\nTake a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=9.\n\nTotal: 1+2+3+5+9=20.\n\ne gives half of 9, which is 4.5, not integer.\n\nNot valid.\n\nNext, a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=8.\n\nTotal: 1+2+4+5+8=20.\n\ne gives half of 8, which is 4, to a.\n\nNow, e has 4, a has 5.\n\nDistribution: 5,2,4,5,4. Duplicates.\n\nNot valid.\n\nNext, a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=7.\n\nTotal: 1+3+4+5+7=20.\n\ne gives half of 7, which is 3.5, not integer.\n\nNot valid.\n\nNext, a=2, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=6.\n\nTotal: 2+3+4+5+6=20.\n\ne gives half of 6, which is 3, to a.\n\nNow, e has 3, a has 5.\n\nDistribution: 5,3,4,5,3. Duplicates.\n\nNot valid.\n\nSo, it seems in all possible distributions, after the transaction, duplicates occur.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the person with the most after transaction is someone else.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the person who originally had the most, after giving half to the person with the least.\n\nIt's asking how many apples that person has left.\n\nSo, in the first distribution:\n\nOriginal: 1,2,3,4,10.\n\nGiver has 10, gives 5 to 1, has 5 left.\n\nIn the third distribution:\n\nOriginal: 1,2,4,5,8.\n\nGiver has 8, gives 4 to 1, has 4 left.\n\nIn the fifth distribution:\n\nOriginal: 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nGiver has 6, gives 3 to 2, has 3 left.\n\nSo, in each case, the person who gave has e/2 left, where e was the original largest amount.\n\nBut e varies in different distributions.\n\nIs there a way to determine e uniquely?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's only one distribution where after transaction, all counts remain distinct.\n\nBut from above, in all possible distributions, after transaction, duplicates occur.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to assume a particular distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the person who originally had the most, after giving half, no longer has the most, and that's acceptable.\n\nIn that case, in each distribution, the person who gave has e/2 left.\n\nBut the question is to find that amount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique value for e/2 across all possible distributions.\n\nBut from above, e can be 10,8,6, etc., so e/2 can be 5,4,3, etc.\n\nNot unique.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the minimal possible for a, and corresponding e.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible for a is 1, and corresponding e is 10.\n\nIn that case, e/2=5.\n\nBut as seen, in other distributions, e/2 is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find e in terms of the total.\n\nWait, total is 20, and e is the largest.\n\nNeed to maximize e, given that all are distinct positives and sum to 20.\n\nTo maximize e, minimize others.\n\nSo, a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=10.\n\nIn this case, e=10, gives 5, has 5 left.\n\nAlternatively, if e is less, like 9, but that requires a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=9, which sums to 20.\n\nBut half of 9 is 4.5, which is not integer.\n\nSo, perhaps only e even values are acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, e=8: a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=8.\n\nGives 4, has 4 left.\n\nE=6: a=2, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=6.\n\nGives 3, has 3 left.\n\nSo, possible e values are 6,8,10, corresponding to e/2=3,4,5.\n\nSo, the person has e/2 left, where e is even and satisfies the sum.\n\nBut without more constraints, e/2 can be 3,4,5.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that the person has e/2 left, where e is the original largest even number in the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume a particular distribution, like the minimal e, or maximal e.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on some condition I missed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the person who gives half and the person who receives are distinct, and all others remain unchanged.\n\nIn that case, after transaction, the giver has e/2, and the receiver has a + e/2.\n\nIn the first distribution: giver had 10, gives 5, has 5 left; receiver had 1, has 6.\n\nOthers: 2,3,4.\n\nSo, distribution: 6,2,3,4,5.\n\nWhich has duplicates if e/2 equals one of the others.\n\nIn this case, 5 is already present if e=10.\n\nSimilarly, in e=8, gives 4, has 4 left; receiver has 1+4=5.\n\nDistribution:5,2,3,4,4. Duplicates.\n\nIn e=6, gives 3, has 3 left; receiver has 2+3=5.\n\nDistribution:5,3,4,5,3. Duplicates.\n\nSo, in all cases, duplicates occur after transaction.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to ignore the duplication issue and just compute e/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique distribution where e/2 doesn't duplicate any existing count.\n\nWait, in e=8, giving 4, has 4 left; receiver has 1+4=5.\n\nOthers are 2 and 3.\n\nSo, distribution:5,2,3,4,4.\n\nDuplicates at 4.\n\nIn e=10, giving 5, has 5 left; receiver has 1+5=6.\n\nOthers are 2,3,4.\n\nDistribution:6,2,3,4,5.\n\nWait, does this have duplicates? 6,2,3,4,5 are all distinct.\n\nWait, in this case, yes, all are distinct.\n\nWait, in the first distribution: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=10.\n\nAfter transaction: a=6, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5.\n\nAll distinct: 6,2,3,4,5.\n\nNo duplicates.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were duplicates, but actually, no, they are all distinct.\n\nSo, in this case, it works.\n\nSimilarly, in e=8, giving 4, has 4 left; a=5, others 2,3,4.\n\nDistribution:5,2,3,4,4. Here, duplicates at 4.\n\nIn e=6, giving 3, has 3 left; a=5, others 3,4,5.\n\nDistribution:5,3,4,5,3. Duplicates at 3 and 5.\n\nSo, only in the case where e=10, the distribution after transaction has all distinct counts.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the intended distribution is a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=10.\n\nIn this case, e gives 5, has 5 left.\n\nSo, the answer is 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that after transaction, duplicates are allowed, and still proceed.\n\nBut in that case, e/2 varies based on e.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal e is 10, and thus e/2=5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula to directly compute e.\n\nAlternately, perhaps I can set up equations.\n\nLet the amounts be a,b,c,d,e with a < b < c < d < e.\n\nAnd a + b + c + d + e = 20.\n\nWe need to find e - e/2 = e/2 after transaction.\n\nSo, need to find e/2.\n\nBut e can take multiple values, as seen in possible distributions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution based on some constraints I haven't considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have multiple solutions, but given the condition of distinctness, only one distribution works without duplicates after transaction.\n\nAs seen, only e=10 leads to distinct counts after transaction.\n\nTherefore, e=10, e/2=5.\n\nSo, the person has 5 apples left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]\n"
