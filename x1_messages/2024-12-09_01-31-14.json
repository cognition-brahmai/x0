        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a chemical reaction has a rate constant k = 0.025 min^-1, and I need to calculate the half-life of the reaction. Okay, first things first, I need to remember what half-life means in the context of chemical reactions. Half-life is the time it takes for the concentration of a reactant to decrease by half. It's a way to measure how fast a reaction is proceeding.\n\nNow, the rate constant k is given in units of per minute (min^-1), which tells me that this is probably a first-order reaction. In first-order reactions, the rate depends on the concentration of a single reactant, and the units of the rate constant are typically time^-1, which matches what's given here.\n\nSo, for a first-order reaction, the half-life (t\u00bd) is related to the rate constant (k) by the equation:\n\nt\u00bd = ln(2) / k\n\nI think that's the formula I need to use here. Let me make sure I remember this correctly. The natural logarithm of 2 is approximately 0.693, and dividing that by the rate constant should give me the half-life in the same time units as the rate constant, which is minutes in this case.\n\nAlright, so plugging in the values:\n\nt\u00bd = ln(2) / 0.025 min^-1\n\nFirst, calculate ln(2):\n\nln(2) \u2248 0.693\n\nSo,\n\nt\u00bd = 0.693 / 0.025 min^-1\n\nNow, dividing 0.693 by 0.025:\n\nLet me see, 0.693 divided by 0.025. To make this easier, I can think of it as 0.693 divided by 25 hundredths. Alternatively, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to get rid of the decimals:\n\n0.693 / 0.025 = 69.3 / 2.5 = 27.72 minutes\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. 69.3 divided by 2.5:\n\n2.5 times 27 is 67.5, and 69.3 minus 67.5 is 1.8. So, 27 plus 1.8 divided by 2.5. 1.8 divided by 2.5 is 0.72. So, total is 27.72 minutes.\n\nSo, the half-life is approximately 27.72 minutes.\n\nBut, I should consider the significant figures. The rate constant is given to three significant figures (0.025 min^-1), so the answer should also be reported to three significant figures. However, 0.693 has three significant figures, and 0.025 has two. Wait, 0.025 has two significant figures, right? The zero before the 25 doesn't count as a significant figure.\n\nSo, actually, the rate constant has two significant figures, so the answer should be reported to two significant figures as well.\n\nTherefore, 27.72 minutes should be rounded to 28 minutes.\n\nSo, the half-life of the reaction is 28 minutes.\n\nWait a second, is this indeed a first-order reaction? How do I know for sure? Well, the units of the rate constant are time^-1, which is characteristic of first-order reactions. For zero-order reactions, the rate constant has units of concentration per time, and for second-order reactions, it's per concentration per time. So, yes, this must be a first-order reaction.\n\nJust to double-check, is there a different formula for half-life in other order reactions? For zero-order reactions, the half-life is t\u00bd = [A]\u2080 / 2k, and for second-order reactions, t\u00bd = 1 / (k[A]\u2080). But in this case, since it's first-order, the formula I used is correct.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The rate constant is in min^-1, so the half-life will be in minutes, which is fine.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to express the half-life in seconds or hours, I could convert it, but the problem doesn't specify units beyond what's given, so minutes should be acceptable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the reaction is first-order with respect to one reactant or if it's overall first-order for a reaction with multiple reactants. But since the problem just says \"a chemical reaction\" and gives the rate constant with units of time^-1, I think it's safe to assume it's a first-order reaction.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the half-life of the reaction is 28 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
