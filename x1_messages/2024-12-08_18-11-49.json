        "content": "Machu Picchu, the breathtaking ancient city perched high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, was built by the Inca civilization. This remarkable citadel is often referred to as the \"Lost City of the Incas\" due to its remote location and the mystery surrounding its purpose. The Inca Empire, which flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries, constructed Machu Picchu using advanced engineering techniques and without the use of wheels or iron tools. The city's precise stonework and integration with the natural landscape continue to amaze archaeologists and tourists alike."
