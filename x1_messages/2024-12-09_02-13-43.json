This refers to any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. These modifications can introduce new traits or characteristics that don't occur naturally within the species. GMOs are commonly used in agriculture to create crops that are resistant to pests, tolerant to herbicides, or have improved nutritional content. They are also used in medical research and production of pharmaceuticals."
