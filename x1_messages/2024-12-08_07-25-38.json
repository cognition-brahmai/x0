        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the shipping company wants to buy new delivery trucks that are more fuel-efficient to save money on fuel and maybe improve their operations. They currently have 100 trucks, each traveling 200 miles per day and consuming 10 gallons of diesel fuel per day. The new trucks are said to have 15% better fuel efficiency. We need to calculate the potential fuel cost savings over a year if they replace their entire fleet with these new trucks. Additionally, we should consider the initial investment needed to purchase the new trucks and figure out how long it would take for the fuel savings to pay back that investment\u2014that's called the payback period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what fuel efficiency means in this context. Fuel efficiency is usually measured in miles per gallon (mpg). So, if the current trucks are consuming 10 gallons to travel 200 miles, their fuel efficiency is 200 miles divided by 10 gallons, which is 20 mpg.\n\nNow, the new trucks offer 15% better fuel efficiency. So, if the current trucks are at 20 mpg, a 15% improvement would be an increase of 15% of 20 mpg. Let's calculate that:\n\n15% of 20 mpg is 0.15 times 20, which is 3 mpg. So, the new trucks would have a fuel efficiency of 20 + 3 = 23 mpg.\n\nNext, I need to find out how much fuel each new truck would consume per day. Since they still travel 200 miles per day, but now with 23 mpg, the daily fuel consumption would be 200 miles divided by 23 mpg. That's approximately 8.696 gallons per day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the daily fuel savings per truck. The current consumption is 10 gallons per day, and the new consumption is about 8.696 gallons per day. So, the savings per truck per day is 10 - 8.696 = 1.304 gallons.\n\nSince there are 100 trucks, the total daily fuel savings would be 100 times 1.304 gallons, which is 130.4 gallons per day.\n\nTo find the annual fuel savings, we need to know how many days in a year the trucks operate. Assuming they operate 365 days a year, the annual fuel savings would be 130.4 gallons per day times 365 days, which equals 47,656 gallons per year.\n\nNow, to calculate the cost savings, we need to know the price per gallon of diesel fuel. This information isn't provided, so I'll have to assume a price. Let's assume the cost of diesel is $3 per gallon, which is a rough estimate. Therefore, the annual fuel cost savings would be 47,656 gallons times $3 per gallon, which is $142,968 per year.\n\nNext, we need to consider the initial investment required to purchase the new trucks. This information isn't provided either, so again, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's assume that each new truck costs $100,000 and that the company needs to replace all 100 trucks. So, the total initial investment would be 100 trucks times $100,000 per truck, which is $10,000,000.\n\nNow, to determine the payback period, which is how long it takes for the fuel savings to cover the initial investment, we can divide the initial investment by the annual fuel cost savings.\n\nSo, $10,000,000 divided by $142,968 per year. Let's do that calculation:\n\n$10,000,000 / $142,968 \u2248 70 years.\n\nWait, that seems too long. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the numbers.\n\nFirst, the current fuel efficiency: 200 miles per day / 10 gallons = 20 mpg. That seems correct.\n\nNew fuel efficiency: 20 mpg + 15% = 23 mpg. That also seems correct.\n\nDaily fuel consumption for new trucks: 200 miles / 23 mpg \u2248 8.696 gallons. Okay.\n\nDaily fuel savings per truck: 10 - 8.696 = 1.304 gallons. Alright.\n\nTotal daily fuel savings for 100 trucks: 100 * 1.304 = 130.4 gallons. Got it.\n\nAnnual fuel savings: 130.4 gallons/day * 365 days/year = 47,656 gallons/year. Correct.\n\nAssuming $3 per gallon, annual cost savings: 47,656 * $3 = $142,968 per year.\n\nInitial investment: 100 trucks * $100,000 = $10,000,000.\n\nPayback period: $10,000,000 / $142,968 \u2248 70 years. That does seem too long.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the cost per gallon or the price of the trucks.\n\nLet me consider different assumptions.\n\nPerhaps the cost of diesel is higher or lower. Let's assume $4 per gallon instead of $3.\n\nThen, annual fuel cost savings: 47,656 gallons * $4 = $190,624 per year.\n\nPayback period: $10,000,000 / $190,624 \u2248 52.46 years.\n\nStill quite long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost of new trucks is lower. Suppose each new truck costs $50,000 instead of $100,000.\n\nThen, total initial investment: 100 * $50,000 = $5,000,000.\n\nPayback period: $5,000,000 / $142,968 \u2248 35 years.\n\nStill a very long payback period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trucks are used for more years, but typically, a payback period of several decades isn't practical for business investments.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nMaybe the new trucks are more fuel-efficient, but there are other factors to consider, like maintenance costs or truck lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company doesn't need to replace all trucks at once, and can phase in the new fleet over time, reducing the initial investment.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it's to replace the entire fleet at once.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fuel savings aren't just from mileage but also from other efficiencies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption about fuel prices is not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trucks operate more days or hours than assumed.\n\nWait, perhaps the trucks operate more than 365 days a year. Maybe they operate every day, including weekends.\n\nBut 365 days is the standard number of days in a year, including leap years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trucks operate multiple shifts per day, but the problem states \"per day,\" so perhaps 200 miles per day is total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other costs associated with the new trucks, like training or maintenance, that should be included in the initial investment.\n\nBut without specific information, it's hard to factor those in.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the payback period should consider the useful life of the trucks. For example, if the new trucks have a useful life of 10 years, a payback period of 10 years might be acceptable.\n\nBut in this case, even with a $50,000 per truck cost and $4 per gallon fuel cost, the payback period is around 35 years, which is longer than the useful life assumption.\n\nThis suggests that, based on the assumptions, the fuel savings alone may not justify the initial investment in new trucks within a reasonable payback period.\n\nHowever, there might be other benefits to consider, such as reduced emissions, improved reliability, or higher resale values, which aren't factored into this calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current assumptions about fuel efficiency or consumption are incorrect.\n\nLet me verify the fuel efficiency calculation again.\n\nCurrent consumption: 10 gallons per day for 200 miles, so 20 mpg.\n\nNew trucks: 15% better, so 23 mpg.\n\nDaily miles remain the same, so new consumption is 200 / 23 \u2248 8.696 gallons per day.\n\nSavings per truck per day: 10 - 8.696 = 1.304 gallons.\n\nFor 100 trucks: 130.4 gallons per day.\n\nAnnual savings: 130.4 * 365 = 47,656 gallons per year.\n\nAt $3 per gallon: $142,968 per year.\n\nInitial investment: $10,000,000.\n\nPayback period: $10,000,000 / $142,968 \u2248 70 years.\n\nAlternatively, at $4 per gallon: $190,624 per year, payback period of about 52 years.\n\nWith $50,000 per truck: $5,000,000 total, payback period of about 35 years at $3 per gallon.\n\nThis suggests that, under these assumptions, the payback period is too long to be practical.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there are mistakes in the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company is considering government incentives or subsidies for purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles, which could reduce the initial investment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new trucks have lower maintenance costs, which could add to the annual savings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the company plans to lease the trucks rather than buy them, changing the initial investment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fuel efficiency improvement is greater than 15%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company operates more trucks than 100.\n\nBut based on the information provided, with 100 trucks, each traveling 200 miles per day, consuming 10 gallons of diesel, and new trucks offering 15% better fuel efficiency, the payback period for replacing the entire fleet seems excessively long, unless other cost savings or factors are considered.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that, under the given assumptions, the payback period for the initial investment in new trucks is not favorable, and the company may need to consider other factors or seek more significant improvements in fuel efficiency to make the investment practical.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The payback period for the initial investment in new trucks is not favorable under the given assumptions.}}"
