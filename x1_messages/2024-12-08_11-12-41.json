JIM CLANCY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Why is Russian president Vladimir Putin using his last state of the nation address to complain about a U.S. missile defense system, and why is Europe objecting to his objections? MCEDWARDS: U.S. troops in Iraq may get their marching orders from Capitol Hill, although a presidential veto of any timetable for a withdrawal is a more likely tactic. CLANCY: And the British government now says Prince Harry may not be sent to Iraq after all. The young soldier prince not at all happy about that. MCEDWARDS: It is 7:00 p.m. in Istanbul, high noon on Capitol Hill. Hello and welcome too our report broadcast around the globe. I\\'m Colleen McEdwards. CLANCY: I\\'m Jim Clancy. From Moscow to Mumbai, Istanbul to Beijing, wherever you are watching, this is YOUR WORLD TODAY. Well, we are going to begin our report this hour, once again, in Istanbul, Turkey. That\\'s where an eight-story building has just been flattened to the ground. MCEDWARDS: Yes, that\\'s right. There are no reports of injuries at this time, but news services are reporting that many ambulances and emergency vehicles are being sent to the site of the collapse. Video from our sister network, CNN Turk, shows you the scene right there. I mean, this is extensive damage. There are reports that it was six stories, reports that there were eight stories, as well. CLANCY: Now, emergency workers, you can see them there. This is video that\\'s come in to us. Really neighbors out there, some of them digging with their bare hands. They believe that there are people still trapped in that rubble, although a lot of them got out of the building. MCEDWARDS: Yes, that\\'s true. There was a warning, apparently, according to our reporter who is in the city there. There was some excavation work, some construction work going on next door. People heard cracks in the building, and many people got out, but we also see reports that some people may have decided to go back in. CLANCY: All right. We\\'re going to keep you updated on this developing story, no doubt about that. And to get more details to you right away, Andrew Finkel joins us on the line from Istanbul. Andrew, take us back to the beginning of all of this. Just give us an idea, what happened and why? ANDREW FINKEL, JOURNALIST: Well, this building -- it was exactly an hour ago that this building appeared to collapse. And why it collapsed, it seems, is that they were trying to tear down the building next door. There were excavations going on next door. Residents heard cracks. There was a great deal of panic. People, it seems, were evacuated from the building. But some people may have actually gone back in. Now, the building seems to have just collapsed like a deck of cards. The first on the scene were neighbors trying to dig away at the concrete. They were joined by the fire brigade. There\\'s a fleet of ambulances on standby. The mayor of Istanbul has just said that he -- they know of two people at least who they believe are still trapped under the rubble. We\\'ve heard reports that perhaps there\\'s children, cries from underneath. At the moment, no one has actually been rescued, and, indeed, no one -- there have been no bodies discovered, either. So, we are still in a state of darkness, really -- Jim. CLANCY: Now, as we look at this videotape that\\'s coming in it, it would appear there\\'s no heavy equipment yet on the scene. It\\'s only been, as you noted, an hour. FINKEL: Well, that\\'s right. And often, very often in these cases, heavy equipment is the last thing you want, because when you sort of move one of these great big blocks, it causes a certain amount of shifting, and anyone who might still be alive under there wouldn\\'t last. So, it is actually something that has to be done with bare hands. Sadly, Turkey has a great deal of experience in this. There was a terrible earthquake here in 1999, and they may have perfected it, as it were, the technique of searching for people trapped under the rubble. There are some very knowledgeable and professional people who do this sort of thing. At the moment, it appears to be volunteers on the scene. And, of course, there have been these sorts of accidents before. I can\\'t remember the exact date, but there was a building in a neighborhood not all that far from here which just collapsed and killed two people for -- just because of shoddy construction. CLANCY: Do we have any idea exactly how many people may be inside, how many got out? FINKEL: Well, not yet. It\\'s obviously quite a big building, and the fact that they appear -- people seem to appear to have had some warning means that a lot of people have gotten out. However, there are a real fleet of ambulances. There are about 17 ambulances on standby, which obviously anticipating the worst. We know of two people, we believe, who are trapped under there, according to an announcement by the mayor on tel3evision. CLANCY: Andrew Finkel on the line with us there, keeping us abreast of the latest details coming out of Istanbul, Turkey, where this multi-story building has been flattened to the ground. We\\'ll keep you updated on this story. Andrew, thank you. FINKEL: A pleasure. MCEDWARDS: Thanks, Jim. We\\'ve actually got more for you now. We have reached a reporter on the scene for the first time, the first time we have really been able to get to the scene of what\\'s happened. Marat Utku (ph) is on the scene for us and joins us now. Marat (ph), describe what you see. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, there is a big rush here. All the ambulances, all the fire brigades, trucks, are trying to come here. But let me say, this is the rush hour in Istanbul. So it\\'s really very hard for them to come here. These are really very narrow streets, and it is really very crowded, because this is a very small neighborhood, very narrow roads. And the fire brigade is really having a hard time to come along here. But now the policemen came, the ambulances came, the fire brigades just came, and they are trying to MCEDWARDS: All right. Marat Utku (ph), our first reporter on the scene there, describing some difficulty, if I understood him correctly, with emergency crews getting in there because of the narrow streets, and because of the chaos around the scene. Turkish rescue officials are experienced at this kind of thing because of the infrastructure problems with buildings in Istanbul, and also because of the number of earthquakes that happen there. What they are trying to do now is get as many rescue officials in so that they can literally use their hands and their ears to try to find people who may be buried underneath that rubble. CLANCY: All right. We will continue to follow this, but for now, we\\'re going to shift gears a little bit. MCEDWARDS: Yes, that\\'s right. We want to turn to Washington now from this breaking news, because you know about the showdown that\\'s brewing over the funding of the war in Iraq. It has reached the floor of the U.S. Senate. CLANCY: On Wednesday, the House, of course, narrowly passed that funding bill that sets a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq. You are looking at a live picture here. MCEDWARDS: U.S. President Bush told the Senate to quickly pass this bill, essentially, so he can go ahead and veto it, as he says he will. Mr. Bush says Congress should not tell military officials how to do their job. But the Democrats say they are listening to the American people, and the call that they say they heard for change. CLANCY: Now, a just-released survey shows most Americans do support a troop withdrawal from Iraq, a deadline of some kind. A poll conducted by NBC News and \"The Wall Street Journal\" found 56 percent of those questioned favor the recent Democratic measure, while 37 percent are opposed. Now, the same poll found 66 percent of Americans say the country is on the wrong track. Just 22 percent think it is moving in the right direction. The survey conducted over this past weekend, it has a margin of error of 3.1 percent. MCEDWARDS: And in the meantime, the top U.S. commander in Iraq is making the rounds on Capitol Hill. Lieutenant General David Petraeus is arguing against setting a deadline for a withdrawal. And just a short while ago, he spoke to reporters about the military surge that is under way in Baghdad. LT. GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, COMMANDER IN IRAQ: We are still in the relatively early stages of our new effort, about two months into it, with three of five Army surge brigades and two additional Marine battalions on the ground, and the remainder of the combat forces scheduled to be operating in their areas by mid-June. Baghdad is the main effort, and we continue to establish joint security stations and combat outposts in the city and in the belts around it. The presence of coalition and Iraqi forces and increased operational tempo, especially in areas where until recently we had no sustained presence, have begun to produce results. Most significantly, Iraqi and coalition forces have helped to bring about a substantial reduction in the rate of sectarian murders each month from January until now in Baghdad, a reduction of about two-thirds. There have also been increases in weapons caches seized and the number of actionable tips received. In the Ramadi area, for example, U.S. and Iraqi forces have found nearly as many caches in the first four months of this year as they found in all of last year. Beyond this, we are seeing we are seeing a revival of markets, renewed commerce, the return of some displaced families, and the slow resumption of services. Though I want to be very clear that there is vastly more work to be done across the board and in many areas, and I again note that we are really just getting started with the new effort. CLANCY: General David Petraeus there, talking on Capitol Hill. Now, this debate on the Senate floor is continuing. Senator Trent Lott is up there right now speaking. And, you know, when you look at this, with everything that\\'s happened here, one thing comes across very clearly, and that is that this guy, General David Petraeus, is really gaining a lot of respect in the eyes of everyone because of his straight talking on this issue. And he may -- he may sway some minds. MCEDWARDS: Well, and his expertise in dealing with insurgents, as well. But, you know, Petraeus said things could get worse before they get better. He said that in his news conference today, and I\\'m sure that\\'s not a message a lot of lawmakers want to hear. CLANCY: All right. Another major story that has been developing and really involves international diplomacy on a broad scale... MCEDWARDS: Yes, let\\'s move to that now, to Russia. Russia\\'s president, Vladimir Putin, threatening to pull out of a decades-old arms treaty with the West. Mr. Putin\\'s remarks were in his state of the nation speech. And they come as NATO plans a missile defense shield for central and eastern Europe, a move that Russia is vehemently opposing, doesn\\'t want any part of this at all. Matthew Chance joins us now live from Moscow with more on this -- Matthew. MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Colleen, thanks very much. Well, that\\'s right, this latest dispute, this latest threat by Vladimir Putin, threatens to escalate the diplomatic standoff between Russia and NATO over the U.S. plan to deploy missile defenses in eastern Europe, to the west of Russia\\'s borders. The Kremlin has said that it\\'s very concerned about that, they could be destabilizing for security in the region. But Washington says these anti-missile defenses are aimed not at Russia\\'s vast nuclear deterrent, but on the possibility of rogue missiles being fired in the future from countries like Iran or perhaps even from North Korea. Nevertheless, this is something that is really straining relations between the two countries. Vladimir Putin threatening to look at the possibility of freezing implementation of the -- of an important security treaty in Europe that limits the amounts of armed forces to be deployed on both sides of what was NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries. Russia saying that if an agreement is not done with NATO officials in the U.S., and they\\'re talking about today in Norway, then they will look at freezing their commitments underneath that crucial treaty -- Colleen. MCEDWARDS: It was interesting to listen to Vladimir Putin today, Matthew. There\\'s always been speculation that he might try to stay in power longer, even though he\\'s constitutionally barred from doing so. Did he put that speculation to rest? CHANCE: Well, I think to some extent he did, yes. I mean, you\\'re right, there has been a lot of speculation that Vladimir Putin may attempt to change the constitution of Russia to allow him to stand for and to continue a third term as the Russian president. What we got today, Colleen, is perhaps the clearest statement yet that that will not happen. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): In 2008, my term of office expires, and the next address to the federal assembly will be presented by already another head of state. CHANCE: Well, of course there is still a year to run in Vladimir Putin\\'s presidency, though. And so it\\'s still far from too late for him to change his mind -- Colleen. MCEDWARDS: All right. Matthew Chance for us in Moscow. Matthew, thanks very much. CLANCY: All right. We\\'re going to take a short break here. But still ahead, that soldier prince. MCEDWARDS: Yes, he wants to serve on the frontlines in Iraq, but will Britain\\'s Prince Harry attract more danger to himself and to those he\\'s serving with? CLANCY: Plus, in the land of the Kama Sutra, a harmless peck on the cheek? Well, maybe. Maybe not. Anyway, Richard Gere is in hot water over this one. Some in India say the star of \"An Officer and a Gentleman\" behaved in no gentle fashion. MCEDWARDS: Also, a look at the stock market for you the day after. Check that out. Can the Dow build on that number? Stay with us.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 0 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
