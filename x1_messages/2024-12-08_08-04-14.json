        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 12 balls. You're drawing one ball at random, noting its color, putting it back, and then drawing again. You want to know the probability that both balls drawn were red.\n\nFirst, let's understand the total number of possible outcomes for each draw. Since there are 12 balls in total, and each draw is independent (because you're putting the ball back each time), the total number of possible outcomes for each draw is 12.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes for drawing a red ball each time is 5, since there are 5 red balls.\n\nSince the draws are independent, the probability of both events happening (drawing a red ball both times) is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 5/12.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is also 5/12.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both balls being red is (5/12) * (5/12) = 25/144.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 red balls with replacement is 5 * 5 = 25.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw any 2 balls with replacement is 12 * 12 = 144.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 25/144.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nWe can also use the formula for probability of independent events.\n\nThe probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nHere, since the ball is replaced each time, the draws are independent.\n\nSo, P(both red) = P(first red) * P(second red) = (5/12) * (5/12) = 25/144.\n\nAlright, all methods lead to the same answer.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls drawn were red is 25/144.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{144}} \\]"
