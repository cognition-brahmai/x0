        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges $25 per day and $0.15 per mile. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for 5 days and driving it for 450 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost for the days rented. It's $25 per day for 5 days, so I'll multiply 25 by 5.\n\n25 * 5 = 125\n\nSo, the cost for the days is $125.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost for the miles driven. It's $0.15 per mile for 450 miles, so I'll multiply 0.15 by 450.\n\n0.15 * 450 = 67.5\n\nSo, the cost for the miles is $67.50.\n\nNow, I'll add both amounts to get the total cost.\n\n125 + 67.5 = 192.5\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car for 5 days and drive it for 450 miles is $192.50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{192.50} \\]"
