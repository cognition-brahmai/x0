        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we have two products: Product A and Product B. Each has its own profit margin, selling price, and number of units sold. The company sells 100 units of Product A at $200 each, with a profit margin of 30%, and 50 units of Product B at $300 each, with a profit margin of 50%. We need to find the total profit made from both products.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a profit margin is. Profit margin is the percentage of the selling price that is profit. So, for Product A, with a 30% profit margin, it means that for each unit sold, 30% of $200 is profit. Similarly, for Product B, 50% of $300 is profit.\n\nLet me calculate the profit per unit for each product.\n\nFor Product A:\n\nProfit per unit = Selling price * Profit margin\n\n= $200 * 30%\n\n= $200 * 0.30\n\n= $60\n\nSo, for each unit of Product A sold, the company makes $60 in profit.\n\nFor Product B:\n\nProfit per unit = Selling price * Profit margin\n\n= $300 * 50%\n\n= $300 * 0.50\n\n= $150\n\nSo, for each unit of Product B sold, the company makes $150 in profit.\n\nNext, I need to find the total profit from all units sold of each product.\n\nFor Product A:\n\nTotal profit = Profit per unit * Number of units sold\n\n= $60 * 100\n\n= $6,000\n\nFor Product B:\n\nTotal profit = Profit per unit * Number of units sold\n\n= $150 * 50\n\n= $7,500\n\nNow, to find the total profit from both products, I'll add the profits together.\n\nTotal profit = Profit from Product A + Profit from Product B\n\n= $6,000 + $7,500\n\n= $13,500\n\nWait a minute, does that seem right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with Product A:\n\nSelling price: $200\n\nProfit margin: 30%\n\nProfit per unit: $200 * 0.30 = $60\n\nUnits sold: 100\n\nTotal profit from Product A: $60 * 100 = $6,000\n\nProduct B:\n\nSelling price: $300\n\nProfit margin: 50%\n\nProfit per unit: $300 * 0.50 = $150\n\nUnits sold: 50\n\nTotal profit from Product B: $150 * 50 = $7,500\n\nTotal profit: $6,000 + $7,500 = $13,500\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should calculate it another way.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total sales revenue for each product, then apply the profit margin to each, and sum them up.\n\nFor Product A:\n\nTotal sales revenue = Selling price * Number of units sold\n\n= $200 * 100\n\n= $20,000\n\nProfit = Total sales revenue * Profit margin\n\n= $20,000 * 30%\n\n= $20,000 * 0.30\n\n= $6,000\n\nSame as before.\n\nFor Product B:\n\nTotal sales revenue = $300 * 50 = $15,000\n\nProfit = $15,000 * 50% = $15,000 * 0.50 = $7,500\n\nTotal profit: $6,000 + $7,500 = $13,500\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if profit margin is calculated based on cost price instead of selling price. Sometimes, profit margin can refer to profit as a percentage of cost, not selling price.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf profit margin is based on cost, then:\n\nProfit margin = Profit / Cost price\n\nSo, profit = Profit margin * Cost price\n\nBut in this case, the profit margin is given as a percentage of the selling price, because it says \"profit margin on Product A is 30%,\" implying it's 30% of the selling price.\n\nBut to make sure, let's see.\n\nIf profit margin is based on cost, then:\n\nSelling price = Cost price + Profit\n\n= Cost price + (Profit margin * Cost price)\n\n= Cost price * (1 + Profit margin)\n\nSo, Cost price = Selling price / (1 + Profit margin)\n\nThen, profit = Selling price - Cost price\n\n= Selling price - (Selling price / (1 + Profit margin))\n\n= Selling price * (1 - 1/(1 + Profit margin))\n\n= Selling price * ( (1 + Profit margin - 1)/(1 + Profit margin) )\n\n= Selling price * (Profit margin / (1 + Profit margin))\n\nSo, profit = Selling price * (Profit margin / (1 + Profit margin))\n\nHmm, that's a different formula.\n\nBut in the initial approach, I used profit = Selling price * Profit margin, assuming profit margin is based on selling price.\n\nIf profit margin is based on cost, then the profit is less than what I calculated.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should clarify which type of profit margin is being used here.\n\nThe problem says \"profit margin on Product A is 30%,\" but it doesn't specify if it's profit margin based on cost or selling price.\n\nThis could be ambiguous.\n\nLet me see what's the standard convention.\n\nIn business, profit margin can refer to different things, but often, a profit margin expressed as a percentage of the selling price is called the \"gross profit margin,\" while profit margin based on cost is sometimes called the \"profit markup.\"\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps I should consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, assuming profit margin is based on selling price:\n\nFor Product A:\n\nSelling price = $200\n\nProfit margin = 30% of selling price\n\nProfit per unit = $200 * 0.30 = $60\n\nTotal profit from Product A = $60 * 100 = $6,000\n\nFor Product B:\n\nSelling price = $300\n\nProfit margin = 50% of selling price\n\nProfit per unit = $300 * 0.50 = $150\n\nTotal profit from Product B = $150 * 50 = $7,500\n\nTotal profit = $6,000 + $7,500 = $13,500\n\nNow, assuming profit margin is based on cost:\n\nFirst, find the cost price for each product.\n\nFor Product A:\n\nLet cost price be C_A.\n\nProfit margin based on cost = 30%, so profit = 0.30 * C_A\n\nSelling price = C_A + profit = C_A + 0.30 * C_A = 1.30 * C_A\n\nGiven selling price is $200:\n\n1.30 * C_A = $200\n\nC_A = $200 / 1.30 \u2248 $153.85\n\nProfit per unit = $200 - $153.85 \u2248 $46.15\n\nTotal profit from Product A = $46.15 * 100 \u2248 $4,615.38\n\nFor Product B:\n\nLet cost price be C_B.\n\nProfit margin based on cost = 50%, so profit = 0.50 * C_B\n\nSelling price = C_B + profit = C_B + 0.50 * C_B = 1.50 * C_B\n\nGiven selling price is $300:\n\n1.50 * C_B = $300\n\nC_B = $300 / 1.50 = $200\n\nProfit per unit = $300 - $200 = $100\n\nTotal profit from Product B = $100 * 50 = $5,000\n\nTotal profit = $4,615.38 + $5,000 = $9,615.38\n\nSo, depending on whether the profit margin is based on selling price or cost price, we get two different total profits: $13,500 or approximately $9,615.38.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, it's important to clarify which type of profit margin is being referred to in the problem.\n\nHowever, since the problem states \"profit margin on Product A is 30%,\" and without specifying whether it's based on cost or selling price, the standard interpretation in many business contexts is that it's based on selling price, especially when simply referring to \"profit margin.\"\n\nTherefore, the first calculation is likely correct, yielding a total profit of $13,500.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total revenue and total cost, then find the profit.\n\nFirst, find total revenue from both products.\n\nRevenue from Product A = Selling price * Units sold = $200 * 100 = $20,000\n\nRevenue from Product B = $300 * 50 = $15,000\n\nTotal revenue = $20,000 + $15,000 = $35,000\n\nNext, find total cost.\n\nIf profit margin is based on selling price, then:\n\nProfit = Selling price * Profit margin\n\nCost = Selling price - Profit\n\nFor Product A:\n\nCost per unit = $200 - $60 = $140\n\nTotal cost for Product A = $140 * 100 = $14,000\n\nFor Product B:\n\nCost per unit = $300 - $150 = $150\n\nTotal cost for Product B = $150 * 50 = $7,500\n\nTotal cost = $14,000 + $7,500 = $21,500\n\nThen, total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $35,000 - $21,500 = $13,500\n\nThis matches the initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if profit margin is based on cost, as calculated earlier, total profit is approximately $9,615.38.\n\nGiven this inconsistency, it's crucial to determine which interpretation is correct.\n\nUpon further research, I find that profit margin is typically expressed as profit divided by selling price, especially in retail contexts. Therefore, the initial calculation is likely accurate.\n\nThus, the total profit is $13,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13500} \\]"
