        "content": "So I've got this problem here about figuring out how much soil is needed for a garden. The garden is rectangular, 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, and we need to cover it with a layer of soil that's 3 inches thick. I need to find out how many square feet of soil that would be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like they're asking for the volume of soil needed, but they're specifying \"square feet of soil,\" which is a bit confusing because square feet is a measure of area, not volume. Soil depth would add the third dimension to make it a volume. Maybe they mean cubic feet, which is a measure of volume. I think there might be a mistake in the units, but I'll proceed with calculating the volume in cubic feet.\n\nTo find the volume of soil needed, I need to calculate the area of the garden and then multiply it by the depth of the soil layer.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the area of the garden.\n\nThe garden is rectangular, so the area A is length times width.\n\nA = length \u00d7 width\n\nA = 30 feet \u00d7 20 feet\n\nA = 600 square feet\n\nStep 2: Convert the depth from inches to feet.\n\nThe depth is given in inches, but the area is in feet, so I need to convert inches to feet to have consistent units.\n\nThere are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\nDepth = 3 inches \u00f7 12 inches/foot = 0.25 feet\n\nStep 3: Calculate the volume of soil.\n\nVolume V = area \u00d7 depth\n\nV = 600 square feet \u00d7 0.25 feet\n\nV = 150 cubic feet\n\nSo, 150 cubic feet of soil is needed.\n\nWait a minute, but the question asked for \"square feet of soil.\" Maybe they meant to ask for the area, but it's unclear. However, since we're dealing with a layer of soil with thickness, it makes more sense to consider it as a volume.\n\nAlternatively, if they want to know how many square feet are being covered, that would just be the area of the garden, which is 600 square feet. But that doesn't take into account the depth of the soil layer.\n\nI think the intention was to find the volume of soil needed, which is 150 cubic feet.\n\nBut maybe they want to know how many square feet of soil to buy, assuming the soil is sold in a certain way. Sometimes soil is sold by the cubic foot or by the bag, each bag containing a certain cubic feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they meant to ask for the area in square feet that will be covered, which is just the area of the garden, 600 square feet, but that seems too straightforward.\n\nGiven that they specified a thickness of 3 inches, it's likely that they need the volume of soil.\n\nSo, sticking with 150 cubic feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want to know how many square feet of soil are needed if the soil is spread at a certain depth, but in this case, the depth is given.\n\nI'm a bit confused by the phrasing, but based on the information provided, 150 cubic feet seems to be the correct volume of soil required.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]"
