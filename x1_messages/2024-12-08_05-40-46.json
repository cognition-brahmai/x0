It's all about a type of art that doesn't try to look like the real world. Instead, it's more about feelings and ideas. Are you ready? Here it goes:\n\n\"I am not a portrait, nor a landscape fair,\nNo still life or scene, I don't care.\nI twist and turn in shapes untamed,\nColors splash where logic is shamed.\n\nI'm free from the chains of reality's hold,\nEmotions I wear, young and old.\nSome see chaos, others see peace,\nIn my abstract realm, all finds release.\n\nWhat am I, in this artistic guise?\nA puzzle of hues, under open skies.\"\n\nTake your time to think about it. It's okay if you're not sure at first. Abstract art can be a bit mysterious, but that's part of its charm!\n"
