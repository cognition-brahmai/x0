        "content": "Ah, you're asking about a capital city in Europe that's famous for being called \"The City of Light.\" Well, I think I know which one you're referring to. It's Paris, the capital of France. Paris is often called \"La Ville Lumi\u00e8re\" in French, which translates to \"The City of Light.\" This nickname has several origins. One reason is its role as a center of education and enlightenment during the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries. Another reason is its early adoption of street lighting, which made it a bright and safe city compared to others at the time. So, when people think of \"The City of Light,\" Paris is usually what comes to mind."
