        "content": "So there's this snail trying to climb a 12-meter tree. It goes up 3 meters each day but slides down 2 meters each night. I need to find out how many days it takes for the snail to reach the top.\n\nFirst, I should understand the net progress the snail makes each day. During the day, it climbs up 3 meters, but at night, it slides down 2 meters. So, the net gain each day is 3 meters up minus 2 meters down, which is 1 meter per day.\n\nIf it were just 1 meter per day, then for 12 meters, it would take 12 days. But I think there's more to it because on the final day, when it reaches the top, it wouldn't slide back down.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Each day, the snail makes a net progress of 1 meter, but on the day it reaches the top, it won't slide back.\n\nSo, let's say the snail needs to reach 12 meters.\n\nOn day 1: climbs 3 meters, slides down 2 meters, net +1 meter.\n\nOn day 2: climbs to 2 meters, slides down to 1 meter.\n\nWait, no. Let's see.\n\nActually, at the end of each day, after climbing and sliding, the snail has gained 1 meter for each day.\n\nBut on the final day, when it reaches or surpasses the top, it doesn't slide back.\n\nSo, I need to find out on which day it reaches or surpasses 12 meters.\n\nLet me consider that each day it makes a net progress of 1 meter, but on the last day, it climbs 3 meters without sliding back.\n\nSo, maybe I should think about how much it needs to climb before the last day.\n\nSuppose on the last day, it climbs the remaining distance without sliding back.\n\nSo, if the tree is 12 meters, and on the last day, it climbs 3 meters, then on the morning of the last day, it needs to be at least 9 meters, because 9 + 3 = 12.\n\nWait, but it slides down 2 meters each night, so I need to account for that.\n\nLet me try to calculate it step by step.\n\nStart of day 1: at 0 meters.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 0 + 3 = 3 meters.\n\nSlides down 2 meters at night: 3 - 2 = 1 meter.\n\nStart of day 2: at 1 meter.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 1 + 3 = 4 meters.\n\nSlides down 2 meters at night: 4 - 2 = 2 meters.\n\nStart of day 3: at 2 meters.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 2 + 3 = 5 meters.\n\nSlides down 2 meters at night: 5 - 2 = 3 meters.\n\nStart of day 4: at 3 meters.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 3 + 3 = 6 meters.\n\nSlides down 2 meters at night: 6 - 2 = 4 meters.\n\nStart of day 5: at 4 meters.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 4 + 3 = 7 meters.\n\nSlides down 2 meters at night: 7 - 2 = 5 meters.\n\nStart of day 6: at 5 meters.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 5 + 3 = 8 meters.\n\nSlides down 2 meters at night: 8 - 2 = 6 meters.\n\nStart of day 7: at 6 meters.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 6 + 3 = 9 meters.\n\nSlides down 2 meters at night: 9 - 2 = 7 meters.\n\nStart of day 8: at 7 meters.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 7 + 3 = 10 meters.\n\nSlides down 2 meters at night: 10 - 2 = 8 meters.\n\nStart of day 9: at 8 meters.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 8 + 3 = 11 meters.\n\nSlides down 2 meters at night: 11 - 2 = 9 meters.\n\nStart of day 10: at 9 meters.\n\nClimbs 3 meters during the day: 9 + 3 = 12 meters.\n\nNow, on day 10, it reaches 12 meters during the day, and since it has reached the top, it doesn't slide back that night.\n\nSo, it takes 10 days for the snail to reach the top of the 12-meter tree.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's a smarter way to calculate this without listing each day.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each full day cycle (day and night) results in a net gain of 1 meter, except for the last day when it reaches the top.\n\nSo, until the snail is within 3 meters of the top, it makes a net gain of 1 meter per day.\n\nOnce it is at or above 9 meters at the start of the day, it can reach the top in that day's climb.\n\nSo, to reach 9 meters, it needs to have a net gain of 9 meters, with each day contributing 1 meter net gain.\n\nTherefore, it takes 9 days to reach 9 meters.\n\nOn the 10th day, it climbs 3 meters to reach 12 meters and stays there.\n\nSo, total days is 10.\n\nThis matches what I found earlier by listing each day.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
