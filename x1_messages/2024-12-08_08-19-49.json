It's particularly efficient for large datasets and is widely used due to its consistent performance.\n\nTo implement merge sort in JavaScript, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then combine them in a sorted manner. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:\n\n1. **Divide**: If the array has more than one element, we divide it into two halves.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted array.\n\nThe key part of the merge sort is the merge function, which combines two sorted arrays into one sorted array. This is done by comparing the elements of the two arrays and placing them in the correct order.\n\nLet's write the code for the merge sort algorithm in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, we'll define the merge function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction merge(left, right) {\n    let result = [];\n    let leftIndex = 0;\n    let rightIndex = 0;\n\n    while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {\n        if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {\n            result.push(left[leftIndex]);\n            leftIndex++;\n        } else {\n            result.push(right[rightIndex]);\n            rightIndex++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Concatenate any remaining elements from the left or right array\n    return result.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));\n}\n```\n\nNext, we'll define the mergeSort function, which will recursively split the array and merge the sorted subarrays:\n\n```javascript\nfunction mergeSort(arr) {\n    if (arr.length <= 1) {\n        return arr;\n    }\n\n    // Find the middle index\n    const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);\n\n    // Recursively sort the subarrays\n    const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));\n    const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));\n\n    // Merge the sorted subarrays\n    return merge(left, right);\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's test the mergeSort function with an example array:\n\n```javascript\nconst testArray = [34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62];\nconsole.log(\"Original array:\", testArray);\nconst sortedArray = mergeSort(testArray);\nconsole.log(\"Sorted array:\", sortedArray);\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\nOriginal array: [34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]\nSorted array: [5, 7, 23, 32, 34, 62]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Merge Function**:\n    - This function takes two sorted arrays, `left` and `right`, and merges them into a single sorted array.\n    - It uses two indices, `leftIndex` and `rightIndex`, to track the current positions in the `left` and `right` arrays.\n    - It compares the elements at these indices and pushes the smaller one into the `result` array.\n    - Finally, it concatenates any remaining elements from either array.\n\n2. **Merge Sort Function**:\n    - This function recursively divides the input array into two halves until each subarray has one or zero elements.\n    - It then merges these subarrays back together using the `merge` function to produce a sorted array.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted efficiently using the merge sort algorithm.
