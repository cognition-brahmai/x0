        "content": "So, I've got this problem here. A group of friends is splitting the cost of a gift evenly. Each person contributes $12, and there are 8 people in the group. I need to find out how much the gift costs in total.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. If each person is contributing $12 and there are 8 people, I think I just need to multiply the contribution per person by the number of people. So, it should be $12 multiplied by 8.\n\nLet me do the math here. 12 times 8. Well, 10 times 8 is 80, and 2 times 8 is 16, so adding those together, 80 plus 16 equals 96. So, the total cost of the gift should be $96.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I should consider if there's something else involved, like tax or anything, but the problem doesn't mention anything extra. It seems straightforward. They're just splitting the cost of the gift evenly, with each person paying $12, and there are 8 people.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose the total cost is C, and there are 8 people each paying $12. So, C divided by 8 equals $12. Wait, that's the opposite of what I did earlier. If C divided by 8 is 12, then C should be 12 multiplied by 8, which again is $96.\n\nHmm, both ways, I'm getting $96. I think that's the answer. But just to be sure, maybe I should check if there's any possibility of a different interpretation.\n\nIs there any chance that the $12 includes something else besides the cost of the gift? Like, maybe there's a wrapping cost or something, but again, the problem doesn't specify anything like that. It seems like they're just contributing towards the gift itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my multiplication. Let me double-check 12 times 8. 12 times 8 is indeed 96. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of addition. If each person contributes $12, and there are 8 people, then it's like adding $12 eight times: 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12. That's 12 times 8, which is again 96.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the total cost of the gift is $96.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. There doesn't seem to be any trick or additional aspects to consider based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
