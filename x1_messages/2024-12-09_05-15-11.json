        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about four machines in a factory that produce identical items at different rates, and I need to find out how many items they produce together in an 8-hour workday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the production rate of each machine per hour:\n\n- Machine A: 50 items per hour\n\n- Machine B: 60 items per hour\n\n- Machine C: 70 items per hour\n\n- Machine D: 80 items per hour\n\nSince they're all working at the same time for 8 hours, I should probably find out how much each machine produces in 8 hours and then add those amounts together to get the total production.\n\nLet me start by calculating the production for each machine individually.\n\nFor Machine A:\n\nProduction = rate \u00d7 time = 50 items/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 400 items\n\nFor Machine B:\n\nProduction = 60 items/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 480 items\n\nFor Machine C:\n\nProduction = 70 items/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 560 items\n\nFor Machine D:\n\nProduction = 80 items/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 640 items\n\nNow, I'll add up all these productions to get the total:\n\nTotal production = 400 + 480 + 560 + 640\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n400 + 480 = 880\n\n880 + 560 = 1440\n\n1440 + 640 = 2080\n\nSo, the total number of items produced by all four machines in an 8-hour workday is 2,080 items.\n\nWait a minute, is there a faster way to calculate this? Maybe by adding the hourly rates first and then multiplying by the number of hours.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTotal hourly production rate = 50 + 60 + 70 + 80\n\nAdding those up:\n\n50 + 60 = 110\n\n110 + 70 = 180\n\n180 + 80 = 260\n\nSo, the combined production rate is 260 items per hour.\n\nNow, multiply that by 8 hours:\n\nTotal production = 260 items/hour \u00d7 8 hours = 2,080 items\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation, which is a good sign. It looks like both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that 2,080 is the correct total number of items produced by all four machines in an 8-hour workday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2080} \\]"
