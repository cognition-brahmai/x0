        "content": "The Magna Carta, also known as the Great Charter, was signed in 1215 by King John of England at Runnymede, near Windsor. Several key figures played significant roles in its creation and signing:\n\n1. **King John**: As the ruler of England, King John was central to the events leading up to the Magna Carta. His tyrannical rule, heavy taxation, and military defeats had alienated many of his subjects, particularly the barons.\n\n2. **Barons of England**: The barons were the chief opponents of King John. They were powerful landowners who resented John's oppressive policies and demanded reforms. Led by figures like Robert Fitzwalter, they forced John to agree to the Magna Carta.\n\n3. **Stephen Langton**: Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton played a crucial role in mediating between the king and the barons. He helped draft the Magna Carta and is credited with its intellectual foundation.\n\n4. **William Marshal**: A renowned knight and statesman, William Marshal was one of the sureties for the barons, ensuring that the king would\u9075\u5b88 the terms of the Magna Carta. His reputation added credibility to the charter.\n\n5. **Eustace de Vesci**: Another important surety for the barons, Eustace de Vesci was a baron who helped oversee the implementation of the Magna Carta.\n\nThese figures, among others, contributed to the historic agreement that would later be seen as a foundation for constitutional law and individual rights."
