        "content": "Let's see here. So, there's a box with 12 red balls, 8 blue balls, and 5 green balls. That means the total number of balls in the box is 12 + 8 + 5, which is 25 balls. Now, the question is asking for the probability of picking a purple ball randomly without looking.\n\nHmm, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome would be picking a purple ball, and the total possible outcomes are the total number of balls in the box, which is 25.\n\nBut wait a minute, looking back at the information provided, the box contains red, blue, and green balls. There's no mention of any purple balls in the box. So, does that mean there are no purple balls in the box?\n\nIf there are no purple balls in the box, then the number of purple balls is zero. Therefore, the probability of picking a purple ball would be zero divided by 25, which is zero.\n\nWait, but is that possible? Can a probability be zero? Yes, according to probability theory, a probability of zero means that the event cannot happen. In this case, since there are no purple balls in the box, it's impossible to pick a purple ball.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. The box has 12 red, 8 blue, and 5 green balls. That's a total of 25 balls, all of which are either red, blue, or green. There's no mention of any purple balls, so it's safe to assume that there are no purple balls in the box.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a purple ball is zero.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe the question is testing whether I understand that if an event is impossible, its probability is zero. Yes, that seems to be the case here.\n\nSo, the final answer is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
