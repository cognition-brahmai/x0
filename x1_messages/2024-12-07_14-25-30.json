        "content": "Let's see. So, the company originally produces 250 units per day at $10 per unit. That means their original total daily production cost is 250 units times $10 per unit, which is $2,500 per day.\n\nNow, if they increase production to 300 units per day and the cost per unit decreases to $9, their new total daily production cost would be 300 units times $9 per unit, which is $2,700 per day.\n\nTo find the difference in total daily production costs, I need to subtract the original cost from the new cost. So, $2,700 minus $2,500 equals $200.\n\nTherefore, the difference in total daily production costs is an increase of $200 per day.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If they're producing more units but at a lower cost per unit, it's possible that the total cost could be less, or more, depending on the numbers.\n\nLet me calculate it again. Original production: 250 units at $10 each. 250 times 10 is indeed $2,500.\n\nNew production: 300 units at $9 each. 300 times 9 is $2,700.\n\nDifference: $2,700 minus $2,500 is $200.\n\nSo, the total daily production cost increases by $200.\n\nI think that's straightforward. But maybe there's something else I should consider, like fixed costs or variable costs. Wait, the question only mentions the cost per unit, which I assume is the variable cost per unit.\n\nIf there are fixed costs, they would be the same regardless of the production level, so they wouldn't affect the difference in total daily production costs between the two scenarios.\n\nUnless, of course, increasing production affects fixed costs, but that's not typically the case. Fixed costs usually don't change with production levels within a certain range.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the difference in total daily production costs is $200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the difference in cost per unit and how that scales with production.\n\nOriginal cost per unit is $10, new cost per unit is $9, so there's a $1 decrease per unit.\n\nBut if I multiply that $1 decrease by the new production level of 300 units, that would suggest a $300 savings.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match the earlier calculation where total costs increased by $200.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me think about this differently.\n\nIf they produce 300 units at $9 each, that's $2,700.\n\nIf they had produced 300 units at the original $10 each, that would have been $3,000.\n\nSo, by decreasing the cost per unit to $9, they save $300 on the additional 50 units.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, if they produce 300 units at $10 each, it's $3,000.\n\nBut they're actually producing them at $9 each, so total cost is $2,700.\n\nSo, they save $300 on the 300 units.\n\nBut compared to the original production of 250 units at $10 each, which was $2,500, their new total cost is $2,700.\n\nSo, the difference is an increase of $200.\n\nBut according to the savings calculation, they saved $300 on the 300 units by producing at $9 each instead of $10 each.\n\nHowever, increasing production from 250 to 300 units means they're producing an additional 50 units.\n\nThe cost for these additional 50 units at $9 each is $450.\n\nCompare that to what those 50 units would have cost at $10 each, which would be $500.\n\nSo, by producing the additional 50 units at $9 each, they save $50 on those 50 units.\n\nBut their total cost still increases because they're producing more units.\n\nOriginal cost: 250 units at $10 = $2,500.\n\nNew cost: 300 units at $9 = $2,700.\n\nDifference: $200 increase.\n\nAlternatively, if they had produced the same 250 units at $9 each, that would have cost $2,250, which is $250 less than the original $2,500.\n\nBut they're producing 50 more units at $9 each, which costs $450.\n\nSo, the total new cost is $2,250 plus $450 = $2,700.\n\nWhich is $200 more than the original $2,500.\n\nSo, it seems consistent now.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it in terms of total cost.\n\nOriginal: 250 units at $10 = $2,500.\n\nNew: 300 units at $9 = $2,700.\n\nDifference: $200 increase.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the cost per unit.\n\nOriginal cost per unit: $10.\n\nNew cost per unit: $9.\n\nDifference per unit: $1 savings per unit.\n\nBut they're producing 300 units, so potential savings of $300.\n\nHowever, they're producing 50 more units than before, which adds $450 to the cost (50 units at $9 each).\n\nSo, the net effect is $200 increase.\n\nBecause $2,500 (original) + $450 (additional units) - $250 (savings on original 250 units) = $2,700.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nIf they produce 300 units at $9 each, that's $2,700.\n\nIf they had produced 300 units at $10 each, that would have been $3,000.\n\nSo, by producing at $9 each, they save $300.\n\nBut compared to producing only 250 units at $10 each ($2,500), their total cost increases to $2,700.\n\nSo, the net effect is an increase of $200 in total daily production costs.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is:\n\nThe additional 50 units cost $450 (50 units at $9 each).\n\nThe savings on the original 250 units is $250 (250 units times $1 savings per unit).\n\nSo, the net change is an increase of $200.\n\nBecause $450 (additional cost) - $250 (savings) = $200 increase.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the difference in total daily production costs is an increase of $200 per day.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
