        "content": "So I've got this problem here: If you draw two cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards without replacement, what's the probability that both cards are aces? Hmm, probability can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what's in a standard deck of cards. There are 52 cards in total, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards, including one ace. So, there are 4 aces in the entire deck.\n\nNow, the problem is about drawing two cards without replacement. That means once I draw the first card, it's not going back into the deck, so the second draw is from a smaller deck.\n\nI need to find the probability that both cards are aces. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet's think about this in terms of sequences. The first event is drawing an ace from the full deck, and the second event is drawing another ace from the remaining deck.\n\nSo, the probability of both events happening is the probability of the first event multiplied by the probability of the second event given that the first event has already occurred.\n\nThat sounds like conditional probability. The formula for the intersection of two events A and B is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A).\n\nIn this case, event A is drawing an ace first, and event B is drawing an ace second given that the first card was an ace.\n\nFirst, let's find P(A), the probability of drawing an ace first.\n\nThere are 4 aces in a deck of 52 cards, so P(A) = 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13.\n\nNext, P(B|A), the probability of drawing an ace second given that the first card was an ace.\n\nIf the first card was an ace, there are now 3 aces left in the remaining 51 cards. So, P(B|A) = 3/51, which simplifies to 1/17.\n\nNow, multiply these two probabilities together to get the overall probability of both events happening.\n\nP(A and B) = (1/13) * (1/17) = 1/221.\n\nWait, but I should double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach the problem.\n\nAnother way is to think about combinations. Since we're drawing two cards without replacement, the total number of ways to draw two cards from 52 is C(52,2), which is 52 choose 2.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to draw two aces from the 4 aces is C(4,2), which is 4 choose 2.\n\nSo, the probability should be C(4,2) / C(52,2).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (4*3*2*1) / (2*1 * 2*1) = 6 / 2 = 3.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, C(4,2) = (4*3)/ (2*1) = 12/2 = 6.\n\nSimilarly, C(52,2) = (52*51)/ (2*1) = 1326.\n\nSo, P = 6 / 1326 = 1 / 221.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but is there a chance that I'm missing something? Maybe considering the order in which the cards are drawn.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered the sequence: first an ace, then another ace. In the combinations approach, order doesn't matter.\n\nBut in probability, sometimes order matters, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nWait, in the first method, I used conditional probability, which takes into account the sequence, but since I'm multiplying the probabilities, it should still give the correct overall probability.\n\nAnd the combinations approach directly gives the probability without considering order.\n\nBoth methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose I draw the first card. The probability it's an ace is 4/52 = 1/13.\n\nThen, given that the first card was an ace, the probability the second card is also an ace is 3/51 = 1/17.\n\nMultiplying these gives 1/221.\n\nAlternatively, if the first card is not an ace, but we're only interested in the cases where both are aces, so we don't need to consider that scenario.\n\nWait, but actually, to be thorough, maybe I should consider the probability of drawing two aces in any order.\n\nBut in this case, since both cards need to be aces, the order doesn't matter. Either way, both have to be aces.\n\nSo, both methods are valid, and they give the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both cards are aces is 1/221.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{221}} \\]"
