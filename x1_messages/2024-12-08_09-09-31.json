        "content": "If it takes 5 minutes to fill one bucket, then for 4 similar buckets, it would take 4 times longer, assuming you're filling them one at a time. So, 5 minutes per bucket multiplied by 4 buckets equals 20 minutes in total. This is because each bucket requires the same amount of time to fill, and you have to do it sequentially unless you have multiple hoses or some way to fill them simultaneously. Since the question doesn't specify any parallel filling, I'll assume it's one hose filling one bucket at a time. Therefore, it would take 20 minutes to fill all 4 buckets."
