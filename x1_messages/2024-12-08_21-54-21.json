        "content": "I'm here to help you with your question about agenda-setting in media studies. So, agenda-setting is this idea that the media has a big role in telling us what issues are important to pay attention to, even if it's not telling us exactly what to think about those issues. It's like the media sets the table with certain topics, and we as the public decide which ones to dig into.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options isn't a level of agenda setting. Let's see what we've got:\n\nA. Media agenda\n\nB. Public agenda\n\nC. Policy agenda\n\nD. Personal agenda\n\nFirst, I need to recall what agenda-setting theory is all about. I remember that it has different levels or dimensions. The basic idea is that there's a flow of attention from the media to the public, and sometimes to policy makers. So, the media presents certain issues as more important, and the public starts to consider those issues as more salient, which can then influence what policies are made or discussed.\n\nSo, the media agenda would be the issues that the media is covering and highlighting. The public agenda would be the issues that the public perceives as important. And the policy agenda would be the issues that policymakers are focusing on or making decisions about.\n\nNow, what about personal agenda? Is that a recognized level in agenda-setting theory?\n\nI think I need to look this up to make sure I get it right. Let me see... According to the classic agenda-setting theory developed by McCombs and Shaw, there are several levels of agenda-setting.\n\nThe first level is about the salience of issues\u2014what topics are prominent in the media and consequently in the public's mind.\n\nThe second level deals with attributes\u2014how the media frames issues can influence how the public perceives them.\n\nThe third level is about latent agenda-setting, which involves the influence on abstract beliefs like attitudes and emotions.\n\nBut in terms of agendas, I know that media agenda and public agenda are central concepts. Policy agenda also comes into play in the sense that what the public considers important can influence what policies are prioritized.\n\nBut personal agenda\u2014does that fit into the standard framework of agenda-setting theory?\n\nI'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's more about individual-level issue importance, but I think that falls under the public agenda.\n\nLet me check some sources.\n\nOkay, according to this article on agenda-setting, the standard levels are first-level (issue salience), second-level (attribute salience), and third-level (abstract belief salience). It mentions that the media agenda influences the public agenda, which can then influence the policy agenda.\n\nBut personal agenda isn't explicitly mentioned as a level in agenda-setting theory.\n\nPerhaps it's a distractor, meaning it's not a recognized level in the theory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some extensions or applications of the theory, personal agenda could be considered, but based on the classic framework, it's not one of the standard levels.\n\nSo, comparing the options:\n\nA. Media agenda \u2013 definitely a part of agenda-setting.\n\nB. Public agenda \u2013 central to the theory.\n\nC. Policy agenda \u2013 influenced by the public agenda.\n\nD. Personal agenda \u2013 not specifically identified as a level in the standard agenda-setting theory.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely D. Personal agenda.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if personal agenda could be considered under public agenda or perhaps as a subset of it.\n\nAfter all, the public agenda is made up of the individual agendas of people in the public. So, personal agenda might be part of the broader public agenda.\n\nHowever, in the context of agenda-setting theory, it's the public agenda as a whole that is influenced by the media, not necessarily individual personal agendas.\n\nBut again, since agenda-setting affects public perception, it must work through individual perceptions.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nMaybe it's better to stick with the standard levels: media agenda, public agenda, and policy agenda.\n\nTherefore, personal agenda isn't a distinct level in agenda-setting theory.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Personal agenda.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
