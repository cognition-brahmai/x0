        "content": "So there are 100 people in a room, and 70% of them wear glasses, and 40% have blue eyes. I need to find out the maximum number of people who could be wearing glasses and have blue eyes.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many people wear glasses and how many have blue eyes.\n\n70% of 100 people wear glasses, so that's:\n\n0.70 * 100 = 70 people wear glasses.\n\n40% of 100 people have blue eyes, so that's:\n\n0.40 * 100 = 40 people have blue eyes.\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum number of people who could be wearing glasses and have blue eyes.\n\nTo maximize the number of people who wear glasses and have blue eyes, I should consider the overlap between the two groups.\n\nThe maximum overlap occurs when as many people as possible are in both groups.\n\nSince there are 40 people with blue eyes and 70 people wearing glasses, the maximum number of people who can have both is limited by the smaller group.\n\nIn this case, the smaller group is the blue-eyed people, which is 40.\n\nSo, theoretically, all 40 blue-eyed people could be wearing glasses.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of people who could be wearing glasses and have blue eyes is 40.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nIf all 40 blue-eyed people are wearing glasses, that would mean that out of the 70 people wearing glasses, 40 have blue eyes.\n\nThat leaves 30 people wearing glasses who do not have blue eyes.\n\nThat seems logical because 70 + 40 = 110, which is more than 100, so there must be an overlap of at least 100 - (100 - 70) - (100 - 40) = 100 - 30 - 60 = 10, but that's the minimum overlap, not the maximum.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWhere:\n\n- |A| is the number of people wearing glasses = 70\n\n- |B| is the number of people with blue eyes = 40\n\n- |A \u222a B| is the number of people in either group, which cannot exceed the total number of people, which is 100.\n\nSo:\n\n100 \u2265 70 + 40 - |A \u2229 B|\n\n100 \u2265 110 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nSubtract 110 from both sides:\n\n100 - 110 \u2265 - |A \u2229 B|\n\n-10 \u2265 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (and reverse the inequality):\n\n10 \u2264 |A \u2229 B|\n\nSo, the minimum overlap is 10 people.\n\nBut the question is about the maximum number of people who could be wearing glasses and have blue eyes, not the minimum.\n\nTo find the maximum, I need to consider the maximum possible value for |A \u2229 B|.\n\nThe maximum overlap cannot exceed the size of the smaller group, which is 40 (the number of people with blue eyes).\n\nSo, the maximum number of people who could be wearing glasses and have blue eyes is 40.\n\nBut, to ensure that this is possible, let's check if it makes sense in the context of the total numbers.\n\nIf all 40 blue-eyed people are wearing glasses, then the number of people wearing glasses would be 40 + (70 - 40) = 70, which matches the given number.\n\nAlso, the number of people with blue eyes would be 40, which also matches.\n\nMoreover, the total number of unique individuals would be 70 (glasses) + 40 (blue eyes) - 40 (overlap) = 70, which is less than or equal to 100.\n\nSo, it's feasible.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of people who could be wearing glasses and have blue eyes is 40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
