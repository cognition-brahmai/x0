        "content": "So there are 5 million people in the city, and the government wants to plant one tree for every 20 residents. Okay, so to find out how many trees they need to plant, I think I need to divide the total number of people by 20.\n\nLet me write that down: number of trees = total population / 20.\n\nSo, total population is 5,000,000 people.\n\nNow, 5,000,000 divided by 20.\n\nLet's see, 5,000 divided by 20 is 250, so 5,000,000 divided by 20 should be 250,000.\n\nWait, but let me check that.\n\nI know that 20 times 250,000 is 5,000,000, so yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, they should plant 250,000 trees.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor involved here.\n\nIs there any chance that the government wants to plant more or less based on other considerations?\n\nWell, the question says \"one tree for every 20 residents,\" so I think 250,000 is the straightforward answer.\n\nMaybe I should double-check the calculation to be sure.\n\nOkay, 5,000,000 divided by 20.\n\nWell, dividing by 20 is the same as dividing by 10 and then by 2.\n\nSo, 5,000,000 divided by 10 is 500,000.\n\nThen, 500,000 divided by 2 is 250,000.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of multiples.\n\n20 times 250,000 is 5,000,000, so it's correct.\n\nI think 250,000 trees is the answer.\n\nBut, maybe there's more to it.\n\nDoes the city have enough space to plant 250,000 trees?\n\nOr are there any restrictions on planting trees?\n\nThe question doesn't mention any constraints, so I think the answer is simply 250,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the government wants to plant different types of trees or something like that.\n\nBut again, the question is straightforward: one tree for every 20 residents.\n\nSo, with 5,000,000 residents, divided by 20, equals 250,000 trees.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250000} \\]"
