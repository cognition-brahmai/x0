        "content": "So if the train is going at an average speed of 90 kilometers per hour and it takes 4 hours to get to where it's going, right? I need to find out how far away the destination is.\n\nI remember that when you're trying to find distance, and you know the speed and the time, you can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, in this case, it would be:\n\nDistance = 90 km/h \u00d7 4 hours\n\nNow, when you multiply those together, the hours unit cancels out because it's in both the speed and the time, leaving you with just kilometers.\n\nSo, 90 times 4 is 360.\n\nTherefore, the destination is 360 kilometers away.\n\nWait a minute, is that all there is to it? It seems pretty straightforward. But maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the train is going at 90 kilometers per hour, that means it covers 90 kilometers every hour. So, in one hour, it's 90 kilometers, in two hours it's 180, in three hours 270, and in four hours 360 kilometers.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time, and I know the average speed and the time, I can rearrange the formula to find distance.\n\nSo, average speed = total distance / total time\n\nTherefore, total distance = average speed \u00d7 total time\n\nAgain, that's 90 km/h \u00d7 4 hours = 360 kilometers.\n\nHmm, I'm getting the same answer both ways, which is a good sign.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the distance, like acceleration or stops along the way.\n\nThe question says it's an average speed of 90 km/h, which means that any speeding up, slowing down, or stopping is already accounted for in that average.\n\nSo, I don't need to worry about additional factors; the average speed takes care of everything.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is straightforward: distance equals speed multiplied by time, which is 90 km/h times 4 hours, equaling 360 kilometers.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
