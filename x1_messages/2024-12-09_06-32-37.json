        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle where the length is twice its width, and the perimeter is 36 cm. We need to find the dimensions, that is, the length and the width of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, I recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for the perimeter is:\n\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width.\n\nGiven that the length is twice the width, I can express the length in terms of the width:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nAnd the perimeter is given as 36 cm, so:\n\n\\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 36 \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 4w + 2w = 36 \\]\n\n\\[ 6w = 36 \\]\n\n\\[ w = 6 \\]\n\nThen, since \\( l = 2w \\):\n\n\\[ l = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the width is 6 cm and the length is 12 cm.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other ways to approach this problem. Maybe using different formulas or considering different properties of the rectangle.\n\nAlternative approach 1: Using the formula for perimeter in terms of length and width.\n\nWe know that \\( P = 2(l + w) \\), and given \\( l = 2w \\), substituting:\n\n\\[ 2(2w + w) = 36 \\]\n\n\\[ 2(3w) = 36 \\]\n\n\\[ 6w = 36 \\]\n\n\\[ w = 6 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( l = 12 \\). So, this confirms the first solution.\n\nAlternative approach 2: Using ratios.\n\nSince the length is twice the width, the ratio of length to width is 2:1. The perimeter is the sum of all sides, which in terms of ratio units would be 2 parts (length) + 1 part (width) added up twice (since there are two of each). So, total parts are 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 parts.\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 36 cm, each part is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, width is 1 part: 6 cm, and length is 2 parts: 12 cm.\n\nThis again leads to the same conclusion.\n\nAlternative approach 3: Using algebraic expressions for area.\n\nWait a minute, the problem only gives the perimeter, not the area. So, I don't have information about the area, which means I can't set up an equation based on area. This approach might not be applicable here.\n\nAlternative approach 4: Considering the rectangle's diagonal.\n\nIf I consider the diagonal, I could use the Pythagorean theorem, but again, no information is given about the diagonal. So, this might not help in this case.\n\nAlternative approach 5: Using the concept of optimization.\n\nFor example, finding the dimensions that maximize the area for a given perimeter. But in this problem, we're not asked to optimize anything; we just need to find the dimensions that satisfy the given perimeter and the relationship between length and width.\n\nSo, this seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nEvaluating the approaches:\n\n- Approach 1: Direct substitution using the perimeter formula. Simple and straightforward. Mathematically sound.\n\n- Approach 2: Using ratios. Also straightforward and confirms the first solution.\n\n- Approach 3: Not applicable since there's no information about the area.\n\n- Approach 4: No information about the diagonal, so not applicable.\n\n- Approach 5: Optimization is not required here.\n\nTherefore, the best approach is Approach 1 or Approach 2, as they are direct and utilize the given information effectively.\n\nFinal answer: The width is 6 cm and the length is 12 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{width } = 6 \\text{ cm}, \\text{ length } = 12 \\text{ cm}} \\]"
