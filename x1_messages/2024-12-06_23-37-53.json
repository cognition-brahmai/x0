It originated in India around the 5th century BCE and is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, who is known as the Buddha. The Buddha's teachings focus on the path to enlightenment and the cessation of suffering. Buddhism has since spread to many other parts of the world and has evolved into various traditions and schools of thought."
