        "content": "So there are 25 red balls and 75 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 100 balls. You're going to pick one ball, look at its color, put it back in the bag, and then pick another ball. You want to know the probability of picking two red balls in a row.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the probability of picking a red ball on the first pick. There are 25 red balls out of 100 total balls, so the probability is 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25.\n\nNow, since you're replacing the ball after the first pick, the total number of balls in the bag stays the same for the second pick. So, the probability of picking a red ball on the second pick is also 25/100, or 1/4, or 0.25.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening in sequence\u2014picking a red ball first and then another red ball\u2014You need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two red balls in a row is:\n\n(1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nOr, in decimal form:\n\n0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nTo express this as a percentage, you multiply by 100:\n\n0.0625 * 100 = 6.25%\n\nTherefore, there's a 6.25% chance of picking two red balls in a row with replacement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{16}} \\]"
