        "content": "Let's see. I have this election problem here. There are two candidates: A and B. Candidate A got 60% of the votes, and candidate B got the rest. The total number of votes cast is 20,000. I need to find out how many more votes candidate A received compared to candidate B.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many votes each candidate got. Since candidate A has 60% of the votes, I can calculate that by taking 60% of 20,000. Similarly, candidate B has the remaining 40% of the votes, so that would be 40% of 20,000.\n\nLet me start by calculating candidate A's votes:\n\n60% of 20,000 is calculated as:\n\n(60/100) * 20,000\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n0.6 * 20,000 = 12,000 votes\n\nNow, for candidate B:\n\n40% of 20,000 is:\n\n(40/100) * 20,000\n\nWhich is:\n\n0.4 * 20,000 = 8,000 votes\n\nSo, candidate A received 12,000 votes, and candidate B received 8,000 votes.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many more votes candidate A received than candidate B. That would be the difference between their vote counts.\n\nDifference = Candidate A's votes - Candidate B's votes\n\nDifference = 12,000 - 8,000 = 4,000 votes\n\nTherefore, candidate A received 4,000 more votes than candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe there's a formula or a different method I could use to verify this answer.\n\nLet\u2019s think about it. The total votes are 20,000. Candidate A has 60%, and candidate B has 40%. The difference in their percentages is 60% - 40% = 20%.\n\nSo, 20% of the total votes would be the difference in their vote counts.\n\nLet's calculate 20% of 20,000:\n\n(20/100) * 20,000 = 0.2 * 20,000 = 4,000 votes\n\nThat matches the earlier result. So, it seems like 4,000 votes is the correct difference.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm the individual vote counts.\n\nCandidate A: 60% of 20,000 = 12,000 votes\n\nCandidate B: 40% of 20,000 = 8,000 votes\n\nDifference: 12,000 - 8,000 = 4,000 votes\n\nEverything checks out. I can be confident that the answer is 4,000 votes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000} \\]"
