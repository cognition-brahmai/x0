The expression is:\n\n((8 - 2)^2 + (6 / 2) - 4) * 3\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate (8 - 2):\n\n8 - 2 = 6\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(6^2 + (6 / 2) - 4) * 3\n\n2. Next, calculate 6^2:\n\n6^2 = 36\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(36 + (6 / 2) - 4) * 3\n\n3. Now, calculate (6 / 2):\n\n6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n(36 + 3 - 4) * 3\n\n4. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n36 + 3 = 39\n\n39 - 4 = 35\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n35 * 3\n\n5. Finally, multiply:\n\n35 * 3 = 105\n\nSo, the final answer is 105.\n"
