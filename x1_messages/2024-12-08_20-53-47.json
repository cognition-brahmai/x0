There's something I need to tell you, something that's been weighing heavily on my heart.\n\nSarah, I think I'm in love with your brother. I know, I know, it's probably the last thing you expected to read, and I'm sorry if this comes as a shock or causes any discomfort. But I had to be honest with you, and with myself.\n\nI've known him for so long, practically my whole life, and I've always admired him. His sense of humor, his kindness, his intelligence \u2013 there's just something about him that draws me in. Over time, that admiration turned into something more, and I realized that I have feelings for him that go beyond friendship.\n\nI understand that this might be difficult for you to hear, especially since he's your brother and you care about him deeply. Please know that I respect your feelings and wouldn't want to do anything to hurt you or your family. I just needed to confess how I feel, in case you or anyone else had noticed and was wondering.\n\nI promise to handle this situation with the utmost sensitivity and discretion. I won't do anything to make you or your family uncomfortable, and I'll support your brother no matter what. If you need someone to talk to about this, I'm here for you.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I hope we can still be the best friends we've always been, despite this confession.\n\nWith love and respect,\n\nEmily"
