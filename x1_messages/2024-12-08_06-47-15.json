        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls and 7 blue balls, so total balls in the bag are 5 plus 7, which is 12 balls. Now, I need to draw 3 balls at random without replacement, and I want to find the probability that exactly two of them are red.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember the formula for probability. Probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 12.\n\nI think I should use combinations here because the order in which I draw the balls doesn't matter. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 12 is C(12, 3). Let me calculate that.\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12 - 3)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9!) / (3! \u00d7 9!)) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 1320 / 6 = 220.\n\nSo, there are 220 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 12.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is C(5, 2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2! \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose 2 red balls.\n\nNow, the number of ways to choose 1 blue ball out of 7 is C(7, 1).\n\nC(7, 1) = 7! / (1! * (7 - 1)!) = (7 \u00d7 6!) / (1! \u00d7 6!)) = 7 / 1 = 7.\n\nSo, there are 7 ways to choose 1 blue ball.\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these two combinations: 10 (ways to choose red) \u00d7 7 (ways to choose blue) = 70.\n\nNow, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 70 / 220.\n\nI can simplify that fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10: 7 / 22.\n\nSo, the probability is 7/22.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability step by step, considering the draws one at a time without replacement.\n\nFirst draw: probability of drawing a red ball is 5/12.\n\nSecond draw: probability of drawing another red ball is now 4/11, since one red ball has already been drawn.\n\nThird draw: probability of drawing a blue ball is 7/10, since two red balls have already been drawn.\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (red, red, blue) is (5/12) \u00d7 (4/11) \u00d7 (7/10).\n\nLet me calculate that: (5/12) \u00d7 (4/11) = (5 \u00d7 4) / (12 \u00d7 11) = 20 / 132 = 5/33.\n\nThen, (5/33) \u00d7 (7/10) = (5 \u00d7 7) / (33 \u00d7 10) = 35 / 330 = 7/66.\n\nBut wait, this is just for one specific order: red, red, blue.\n\nHowever, there are other orders in which I can draw two reds and one blue: red, blue, red; blue, red, red.\n\nSo, I need to consider all possible orders.\n\nThe number of distinct orders is the number of ways to arrange two reds and one blue, which is C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nSo, total probability is 3 \u00d7 (7/66) = 21/66 = 7/22.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the binomial coefficient formula for hypergeometric distribution, which is used for sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) \u00d7 C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (12 balls)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (5 red balls)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (2 red balls)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = [C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(7, 1)] / C(12, 3) = [10 \u00d7 7] / 220 = 70 / 220 = 7/22.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 7/22 is correct.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I calculate the probability of drawing three red balls and subtract it from the probability of drawing at least two red balls.\n\nWait, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of permutations.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 12 without regard to order is C(12, 3) = 220, as before.\n\nNumber of ways to draw exactly 2 red and 1 blue is C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(7, 1) = 10 \u00d7 7 = 70.\n\nSo, probability is 70/220 = 7/22.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the order, the total number of ordered sequences of 3 balls is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 = 1320.\n\nThe number of ordered sequences with exactly two red and one blue is:\n\nNumber of ways to choose which draw is the blue ball (3 choices: positions 1, 2, or 3).\n\nFor each position:\n\n- If blue is first: 7 (blue) \u00d7 5 (red) \u00d7 4 (red) = 7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 = 140\n\n- If blue is second: 5 (red) \u00d7 6 (remaining balls after one red is drawn) \u00d7 7 (blue) = 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 7 = 210\n\nWait, hold on.\n\nActually, after drawing one red, there are 4 red left and 7 blue, so total 11 balls left.\n\nSo, for blue second: 5 (first red) \u00d7 7 (second blue) \u00d7 4 (third red) = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 4 = 140.\n\nSimilarly, for blue third: 5 (first red) \u00d7 4 (second red) \u00d7 7 (third blue) = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7 = 140.\n\nSo, total ordered favorable outcomes: 140 + 140 + 140 = 420.\n\nThen, probability is 420 / 1320 = 420 \u00f7 10 = 42 \u00f7 132 = 7 \u00f7 22, which is again 7/22.\n\nOkay, so no matter which way I approach this, I keep getting 7/22.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{22}} \\]"
