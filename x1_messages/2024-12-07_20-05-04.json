        "content": "So the factory makes 200 units every day, and each unit has a 3% chance of being defective. I need to find out, on average, how many defective units are produced each day.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"3% chance of being defective\" means. Probability tells us the likelihood of something happening, and 3% is the same as 0.03 in decimal form. So, for each unit, there's a 0.03 probability that it's defective.\n\nSince there are 200 units produced each day, I can think of this as 200 independent events, each with a 0.03 probability of being defective.\n\nTo find the average number of defective units, I can use the concept of expected value. In probability, the expected value is what you expect to happen on average.\n\nFor a single unit, the expected number of defective units is:\n\n1 unit * 0.03 probability = 0.03 defective units\n\nBut since there are 200 units, I can multiply this expected value by the total number of units:\n\n200 units * 0.03 defective units per unit = 6 defective units\n\nSo, on average, the factory produces 6 defective units each day.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to think about this? Maybe using the binomial distribution? Because each unit is like a trial with two outcomes: defective or not defective.\n\nIn a binomial distribution, the expected value is given by:\n\nExpected value = n * p\n\nWhere n is the number of trials (units produced), and p is the probability of success (in this case, being defective).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nExpected value = 200 * 0.03 = 6\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. So, on average, there are 6 defective units per day.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this. For example, is the probability of being defective independent for each unit? Or could there be some days where the chance is higher due to machine issues or other factors?\n\nWell, based on the information given, the probability is stated as 3% per unit, and there's no mention of any dependencies between units or varying probabilities on different days. So, I'll assume that each unit's defectiveness is independent of the others.\n\nAlso, since the factory produces 200 units every day, the production rate is constant, which simplifies things.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that 3% of the units are defective. So, if 100 units are produced, 3 would be defective on average. Therefore, for 200 units, it would be twice that amount, which is 6 defective units.\n\nThis matches what I calculated earlier using expected value and binomial distribution.\n\nJust to double-check, I can also think about it in terms of proportions. If 3% of units are defective, then the proportion of defective units is 0.03. Multiplying this by the total production gives:\n\n0.03 * 200 = 6 defective units\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently through different methods. So, the answer should be that, on average, the factory produces 6 defective units each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]\n"
