        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you set up a simple Node.js web server that does what you've described. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, you need to make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check this by running `node -v` in your terminal or command prompt. If it's not installed, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n\nOnce you have Node.js installed, you'll need to create a new directory for your project. Let's call it \"hello-world-server\". Open your terminal or command prompt and run:\n\n```sh\nmkdir hello-world-server\ncd hello-world-server\n```\n\nNow, you need to initialize a new Node.js project. Run:\n\n```sh\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis will create a `package.json` file with some default settings.\n\nNext, you need to install the Express framework, which makes it easier to handle HTTP requests. Run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install express\n```\n\nExpress is a popular Node.js framework that simplifies the process of creating web servers.\n\nNow, create a new file called `server.js` in your project directory. This is where you'll write the code for your server.\n\nOpen `server.js` in your favorite text editor and start by requiring the Express module:\n\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n```\n\nHere, you're importing the Express module and creating an instance of it called `app`. You're also defining the port number your server will listen on, which is 3000 in this case.\n\nNext, you need to create a route that responds with \"Hello World!\" when accessed via a browser. For simplicity, let's make this the response for the root URL (`/`).\n\nAdd the following code:\n\n```js\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n```\n\nThis sets up a GET route for the root URL. When a user accesses your server's root URL in a browser, they'll see \"Hello World!\".\n\nAdditionally, you want to log each request to the console. Express has a built-in middleware called `morgan` that can help with request logging. First, you need to install it:\n\n```sh\nnpm install morgan\n```\n\nThen, require it in your `server.js` and use it in your app:\n\n```js\nconst morgan = require('morgan');\n\napp.use(morgan('tiny'));\n```\n\nThe `'tiny'` option provides a concise log output. There are other options available if you prefer more or less detail.\n\nNow, start your server by listening on port 3000:\n\n```js\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis code tells your server to start listening on port 3000 and logs a message to the console once it's up and running.\n\nPutting it all together, your `server.js` should look like this:\n\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst morgan = require('morgan');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.use(morgan('tiny'));\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nSave the file and go back to your terminal. Make sure you're in the `hello-world-server` directory and run:\n\n```sh\nnode server.js\n```\n\nYou should see the log message indicating that the server is running.\n\nNow, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see \"Hello World!\" displayed on the page. Meanwhile, in your terminal, you should see a log entry for the request.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple Node.js web server using Express that responds with \"Hello World!\" and logs each request to the console.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
