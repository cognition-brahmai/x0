However, I can tell you that many people describe the smell of a new book as a combination of ink, paper, and glue, often referred to as \"book smell\" or \"brand new book smell.\" On the other hand, old books may have a musty or earthy smell due to the aging of the paper and the absorption of environmental odors over time. The distinct scents of new and old books are often appreciated by book lovers and can evoke different emotions and memories."
