        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, we have a baker who makes 10 loaves of bread every hour. He works 8 hours a day, and he works 6 days a week. We need to find out how many loaves he makes in a whole week.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out how many loaves he makes in one day. Since he makes 10 loaves per hour and works 8 hours a day, I can multiply 10 by 8 to get the daily total.\n\n10 loaves/hour \u00d7 8 hours/day = 80 loaves/day\n\nOkay, so he makes 80 loaves each day.\n\nNow, to find out how many loaves he makes in a week, I need to multiply the daily amount by the number of days he works in a week. He works 6 days a week, so:\n\n80 loaves/day \u00d7 6 days/week = 480 loaves/week\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 10 loaves per hour, and 8 hours a day, that is indeed 80 loaves a day. Then, over 6 days, that would be 480 loaves. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the total. For example, are there any holidays or breaks in the week that might mean he doesn't work all 6 days? The problem says he works 6 days a week, so I'll assume that's consistent.\n\nAlso, it's possible that his production rate changes, but the problem states he makes 10 loaves per hour, so I'll assume that's constant.\n\nSo, the total number of loaves he makes in a week is 480.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480} \\]"
