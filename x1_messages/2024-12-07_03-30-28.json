        "content": "So I have this problem here: a car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, and I need to find out how far it's traveled in kilometers. Also, it gives the conversion factor: 1 mile is equal to 1.60934 kilometers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The car is moving at a constant average speed, and I need to find the distance it covers in that time, but converted into kilometers.\n\nI remember that distance, speed, and time are related by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}\n\\]\n\nSo, if the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours, the distance in miles would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance in miles} = 60 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 180 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to convert that distance from miles to kilometers. The conversion factor is 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers. So, to find the distance in kilometers, I can multiply the number of miles by this conversion factor:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance in kilometers} = 180 \\, \\text{miles} \\times 1.60934 \\, \\frac{\\text{km}}{\\text{mile}}\n\\]\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n\\[\n180 \\times 1.60934 = 289.6812 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\nSo, the car has traveled approximately 289.68 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this to confirm my answer. Perhaps I can think about the units and make sure they're handling correctly.\n\nStarting with speed in miles per hour and time in hours, multiplying them gives miles. Then, converting miles to kilometers using the given conversion factor makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about converting the speed into kilometers per hour first and then multiplying by time to get the distance in kilometers directly.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, convert the speed from miles per hour to kilometers per hour.\n\nGiven that 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers, then:\n\n\\[\n60 \\, \\text{mph} = 60 \\times 1.60934 \\, \\text{km/h}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n60 \\times 1.60934 = 96.5604 \\, \\text{km/h}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply this speed by the time to get the distance:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance in kilometers} = 96.5604 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 289.6812 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the distance is indeed 289.6812 kilometers.\n\nMaybe I can round it to a more reasonable number of decimal places. Since the original speed was given to two significant figures (60 mph), and the time is exact, perhaps I should round the answer to two decimal places.\n\nSo, 289.68 kilometers.\n\nBut looking at the conversion factor, 1.60934, which has five decimal places, it seems the problem expects some precision. Maybe I should keep more decimal places in my answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the precision of the given data. The speed is given as 60 mph, which is exact, and the time is 3 hours, also exact. The conversion factor is given to six decimal places. So, perhaps I can keep my answer to six decimal places.\n\nBut that seems unnecessary, as the conversion factor is standardized, and typically, for such conversions, rounding to two or three decimal places is sufficient.\n\nLet me check the problem again. It says \"how far has it traveled in kilometers,\" and gives the conversion factor as 1 mile = 1.60934 km.\n\nI think rounding to three decimal places would be appropriate, so 289.681 kilometers.\n\nWait, but 1.60934 has five decimal places. Maybe I should keep five decimal places in my answer: 289.68120 kilometers.\n\nBut that seems overly precise, as the speed was given without any decimal places. Perhaps I should consider the uncertainty in the speed measurement.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem provides the conversion factor with five decimal places, maybe I should match that precision.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that 60 mph is a precise value, and treat it as such.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overthinking the precision. In practical terms, for most purposes, rounding to two decimal places would suffice.\n\nSo, I'll go with 289.68 kilometers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can present the answer in scientific notation to handle the significant figures better.\n\nBut that might be unnecessary for this context.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the conversion as exact for the purposes of this problem, and calculate accordingly.\n\nGiven that, let's perform the calculation again:\n\nDistance in miles: 60 mph * 3 h = 180 miles.\n\nConvert to kilometers: 180 miles * 1.60934 km/mile = 289.6812 km.\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 289.68 km.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the conversion factor as exact, I can keep more decimal places.\n\nBut in reality, the conversion factor is exact by definition, as 1 mile is precisely 1.60934 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, the calculation 180 * 1.60934 = 289.6812 km is exact.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can report the answer as 289.6812 kilometers.\n\nBut for practical purposes, rounding to two decimal places is sufficient: 289.68 km.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a certain number of decimal places, I should follow that.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume two decimal places are sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the car has traveled 289.68 kilometers.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let's check if there's a more precise way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for distance in kilometers directly.\n\nGiven that speed is 60 mph, and 1 mph = 1.60934 km/h, then the speed in km/h is 60 * 1.60934 = 96.5604 km/h.\n\nThen, distance = speed * time = 96.5604 km/h * 3 h = 289.6812 km.\n\nAgain, rounding to two decimal places: 289.68 km.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the time is exact, and the conversion factor is exact, perhaps I can report more decimal places.\n\nBut in practice, distances are often reported with two or three decimal places for kilometers.\n\nGiven that, I think 289.68 km is an appropriate answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to be more precise, I can report it as 289.681 km.\n\nBut since the conversion factor has five decimal places, perhaps reporting three decimal places is suitable: 289.681 km.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 1.60934 has five decimal places, and multiplying by 180, the result should have five decimal places as well: 289.68120 km.\n\nBut in practical terms, reporting six decimal places might be excessive.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with 289.68 km as the distance traveled by the car in kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{289.68 \\text{ km}} \\]"
