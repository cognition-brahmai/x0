        "content": "So there are 100 people in a room, and we have some information about who speaks English, French, and both. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, 75 people speak English, and 45 speak French. But, 25 people speak both English and French. Hmm, so if I just add the number of people who speak English and French, that would be 75 + 45 = 120. But that can't be right because there are only 100 people in the room. So, I must be double-counting those who speak both languages.\n\nYes, the 25 people who speak both English and French are included in both the English and French counts. So, to get the total number of people who speak at least one of the languages, I need to add the English and French speakers and then subtract those who speak both, to correct for the double-counting.\n\nSo, the number of people who speak at least one language is:\n\n75 (English) + 45 (French) - 25 (both) = 95 people.\n\nNow, since there are 100 people in total, the number of people who do not speak either language would be:\n\n100 - 95 = 5 people.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf 75 speak English, and 25 of those also speak French, then the number of people who speak only English is 75 - 25 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, if 45 speak French, and 25 speak both, then the number who speak only French is 45 - 25 = 20.\n\nThen, adding those who speak only English, only French, and both:\n\n50 (only English) + 20 (only French) + 25 (both) = 95 people.\n\nAgain, 100 - 95 = 5 people who do not speak either language.\n\nThat seems consistent. I think the answer is 5 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
