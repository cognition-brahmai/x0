        "content": "The primary purpose of a leachate collection system in a sanitary landfill is to prevent contamination of groundwater. So, the correct answer is B.\n\nTo elaborate, a leachate collection system is designed to collect and treat the liquid that forms when water passes through buried waste in a landfill. This liquid, known as leachate, can contain a variety of contaminants, including heavy metals, organic compounds, and pathogens. If not properly managed, leachate can\u6e17\u5165\u5730\u4e0b\u6c34\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5730\u4e0b\u6c34\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u73af\u5883\u90fd\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\n\nTherefore, the leachate collection system plays a crucial role in protecting groundwater quality by collecting the leachate and diverting it to a treatment facility where it can be processed to remove contaminants before being discharged into the environment or reused.\n\nOption A, providing a source of irrigation water, is not a primary purpose because leachate is contaminated and not suitable for irrigation without treatment. Option C, facilitating the decomposition of organic waste, is not directly related to the function of a leachate collection system, although proper moisture management can influence decomposition rates. Option D, reducing the volume of waste in the landfill, is also not the primary purpose of a leachate collection system; waste volume reduction is typically achieved through compaction, landfill gas management, or other methods."
