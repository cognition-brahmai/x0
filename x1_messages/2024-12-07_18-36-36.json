        "content": "Let's solve the inequality 3x - 5 > 10 step by step. So, we have:\n\n3x - 5 > 10\n\nFirst, I need to isolate the term with the variable x. To do that, I can add 5 to both sides of the inequality. This will cancel out the -5 on the left side. So, adding 5 to both sides:\n\n3x - 5 + 5 > 10 + 5\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n3x > 15\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Since 3 is multiplied by x, I can divide both sides of the inequality by 3 to isolate x. So, dividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x / 3 > 15 / 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx > 5\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x > 5. That means that any value of x greater than 5 will satisfy the inequality.\n\nTo make sure, I can test a value greater than 5 and a value less than 5 in the original inequality to verify.\n\nLet's test x = 6 (which is greater than 5):\n\n3(6) - 5 > 10\n\n18 - 5 > 10\n\n13 > 10\n\nThis is true, so x = 6 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's test x = 4 (which is less than 5):\n\n3(4) - 5 > 10\n\n12 - 5 > 10\n\n7 > 10\n\nThis is false, so x = 4 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution x > 5 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x > 5} \\]"
