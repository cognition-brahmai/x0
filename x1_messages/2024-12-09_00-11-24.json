It seems like you're describing something that is active at night and hides during the day, but then says it \"shines\" for a brief time at dawn before hiding again. Is this a riddle? If so, I'm happy to try and solve it. But I must say, I'm a bit confused by the wording. Could you perhaps provide some context or clarify what exactly you're asking?"
