        "content": "To solve the differential equation dy/dx = 3y + 2x, we can use the method of integrating factors. This is a first-order linear differential equation, which has the general form:\n\ndy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\ndy/dx - 3y = 2x\n\nSo, P(x) = -3 and Q(x) = 2x.\n\nThe integrating factor is given by:\n\n\u03bc(x) = e^(\u222bP(x) dx) = e^(\u222b-3 dx) = e^(-3x)\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(-3x)(dy/dx - 3y) = 2x e^(-3x)\n\nThe left side is now the derivative of the product y(x)e^(-3x):\n\nd/dx [y e^(-3x)] = 2x e^(-3x)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n\u222b d[y e^(-3x)] = \u222b 2x e^(-3x) dx\n\nTo solve the integral on the right side, we can use integration by parts. Let's set:\n\nu = 2x, dv = e^(-3x) dx\n\nThen:\n\ndu = 2 dx, v = -1/3 e^(-3x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\n\nSo:\n\n\u222b 2x e^(-3x) dx = 2x (-1/3 e^(-3x)) - \u222b (-1/3 e^(-3x)) (2 dx)\n\n= -2/3 x e^(-3x) + (2/3) \u222b e^(-3x) dx\n\n= -2/3 x e^(-3x) - 2/9 e^(-3x) + c\n\nTherefore:\n\ny e^(-3x) = -2/3 x e^(-3x) - 2/9 e^(-3x) + c\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = e^(3x) [ -2/3 x e^(-3x) - 2/9 e^(-3x) + c ]\n\n= -2/3 x - 2/9 + c e^(3x)\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\ny(x) = -2/3 x - 2/9 + c e^(3x)\n\nWhere c is an arbitrary constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{y(x) = -\\dfrac{2}{3}x - \\dfrac{2}{9} + c e^{3x}} \\]"
