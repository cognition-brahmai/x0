        "content": "I'm here to help you with your Node.js script that interacts with a MongoDB database. Let's break down the task step by step.\n\nFirst, you need to set up a Node.js environment and install the necessary packages. You'll need `mongodb` for connecting to MongoDB and `dotenv` to handle environment variables.\n\nHere's how you can install them:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mongodb dotenv\n```\n\nNext, you'll create a `.env` file to store your MongoDB connection string and the target JSON file path. This keeps your sensitive information separate from your code.\n\nCreate a `.env` file with the following content:\n\n```\nMONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string\nOUTPUT_FILE=path_to_your_output_json_file.json\n```\n\nReplace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string and `path_to_your_output_json_file.json` with the desired path for the output JSON file.\n\nNow, let's write the Node.js script. I'll guide you through each part.\n\n1. **Import required modules:**\n\n```javascript\nconst { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');\nrequire('dotenv').config();\nconst fs = require('fs').promises;\n```\n\n2. **Read environment variables:**\n\n```javascript\nconst MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI;\nconst OUTPUT_FILE = process.env.OUTPUT_FILE;\n```\n\n3. **Connect to MongoDB:**\n\n```javascript\nasync function connectToDatabase() {\n  const client = new MongoClient(MONGODB_URI);\n  await client.connect();\n  console.log(\"Connected to MongoDB\");\n  return client;\n}\n```\n\n4. **Retrieve and filter products:**\n\n```javascript\nasync function getFilteredProducts(client) {\n  const database = client.db();\n  const productsCollection = database.collection('products');\n  \n  // Retrieve all products\n  const products = await productsCollection.find({}).toArray();\n  \n  // Filter products with price above or equal to $10\n  const filteredProducts = products.filter(product => product.price >= 10);\n  \n  return filteredProducts;\n}\n```\n\n5. **Save filtered products to a JSON file:**\n\n```javascript\nasync function saveToFile(filteredProducts) {\n  await fs.writeFile(OUTPUT_FILE, JSON.stringify(filteredProducts, null, 2));\n  console.log(`Filtered products saved to ${OUTPUT_FILE}`);\n}\n```\n\n6. **Main function to orchestrate the operations:**\n\n```javascript\nasync function main() {\n  try {\n    const client = await connectToDatabase();\n    const filteredProducts = await getFilteredProducts(client);\n    await saveToFile(filteredProducts);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error:\", error);\n  } finally {\n    process.exit();\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Connecting to MongoDB:**\n   - We use the `MongoClient` from the `mongodb` package to connect to the MongoDB database using the connection string from the environment variable.\n\n2. **Retrieving and Filtering Products:**\n   - We access the \"products\" collection and retrieve all documents using `find({}).toArray()`.\n   - We filter the products to include only those with a price of $10 or higher.\n\n3. **Saving to a JSON File:**\n   - We use the `fs.promises.writeFile` method to write the filtered products to a JSON file specified in the environment variable.\n\n4. **Main Function:**\n   - This function handles the overall flow: connecting to the database, getting the filtered products, saving them to a file, and ensuring the process exits properly.\n\nMake sure to handle any errors that might occur during these operations to make your script more robust.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point for your script.
