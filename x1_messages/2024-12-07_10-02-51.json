        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a jar with 8 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 7 green marbles. I need to find the probability of drawing two red marbles in a row without replacing the first one before drawing the second. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know the total number of marbles in the jar. I can get that by adding up all the marbles: 8 red plus 5 blue plus 7 green. That's 8 + 5 + 7, which equals 20 marbles in total.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing two red marbles consecutively without replacement. This means that once I draw the first red marble, I don't put it back into the jar before drawing the second one. So, the number of marbles decreases after the first draw.\n\nLet's think about the first draw. The probability of drawing a red marble first is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles. So, that's 8 red out of 20 total marbles. So, the probability for the first draw is 8/20. I can simplify that to 2/5.\n\nNow, if I've drawn one red marble and not replaced it, the total number of marbles left in the jar is now 19, because I started with 20 and took one out. Also, the number of red marbles left is now 7, since I've already drawn one.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a second red marble is now 7 red marbles out of 19 total marbles. So, that's 7/19.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening consecutively, I need to multiply the probabilities of each event. So, it's the probability of the first draw being red multiplied by the probability of the second draw being red given that the first was red.\n\nSo, that's (2/5) multiplied by (7/19). Let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 2/5 times 7/19. Multiplying numerator times numerator gives 2*7=14, and denominator times denominator gives 5*19=95. So, it's 14/95.\n\nCan I simplify that fraction? Let's see, 14 and 95. 14 is 2*7, and 95 is 5*19. There are no common factors, so 14/95 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing two red marbles consecutively without replacement is 14/95.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can also think about it in terms of combinations to verify.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 marbles out of 20 without replacement is given by the combination formula: C(20,2) = 20! / (2! * (20-2)!) = (20*19)/2 = 190.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 2 red marbles out of 8 is C(8,2) = (8*7)/2 = 28.\n\nSo, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of outcomes, which is 28/190.\n\nSimplifying 28/190, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2: 14/95. Okay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, indeed, the probability is 14/95.\n\nAlternatively, I could express this as a decimal or a percentage. Let's see, 14 divided by 95 is approximately 0.147368, which is roughly 14.74%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form of the answer, leaving it as a fraction is fine.\n\nJust to summarize, the probability of drawing two red marbles consecutively without replacement from a jar containing 8 red, 5 blue, and 7 green marbles is 14/95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}} \\]"
