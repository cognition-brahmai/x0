        "content": "So the question is: if you divide 30 by half and add ten, what do you get?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"divide by half\" means. Dividing by half is the same as multiplying by 2 because half is 1/2, and dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2.\n\nSo, 30 divided by half is 30 * 2 = 60.\n\nThen, I need to add ten to that result.\n\n60 + 10 = 70.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 70.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Sometimes, people might interpret \"divide by half\" differently. Maybe they think it's dividing 30 by 0.5, which is the decimal equivalent of half.\n\n30 divided by 0.5 is also 60, because dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2.\n\nSo, again, 60 + 10 = 70.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some people think that \"divide 30 by half\" means to divide 30 by 2, but that would be incorrect because dividing by half is actually multiplying by 2.\n\nLet me confirm this with an example.\n\nSuppose I have 10 divided by half. Half of 10 is 5, but dividing 10 by 5 is 2. However, dividing by half should be the same as multiplying by 2, which would be 10 * 2 = 20.\n\nWait, but in this example, 10 divided by half (which is 5) is 2, but according to the rule, dividing by half should be multiplying by 2 to get 20, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\n\"Divide 30 by half\" could be interpreted as 30 divided by 0.5.\n\nSince half of 1 is 0.5, dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2.\n\nSo, 30 / 0.5 = 60.\n\nThen, adding ten: 60 + 10 = 70.\n\nAlternatively, if someone interprets \"half\" as 1/2, then 30 divided by 1/2 is also 60.\n\nSo, in both interpretations, the answer should be 70.\n\nBut I recall that in some contexts, \"divide by half\" might mean to divide the number by 2, which would be incorrect.\n\nFor example, if someone says \"divide 30 by half,\" and they mean to divide 30 by 2, which is 15, and then add 10, which would be 25.\n\nHowever, this interpretation is incorrect because dividing by half should be dividing by 0.5, which is multiplying by 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 70.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the order of operations.\n\nThe phrase is \"divide 30 by half and add ten.\"\n\nDivision comes before addition in the order of operations.\n\nSo, first, divide 30 by half, which is 60, and then add 10, which is 70.\n\nIf someone divides 30 by 2 to get 15 and then adds 10 to get 25, that would be incorrect because they misinterpreted \"divide by half.\"\n\nDividing by half is not the same as dividing by 2.\n\nDividing by half is dividing by 0.5, which is the same as multiplying by 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 70.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
