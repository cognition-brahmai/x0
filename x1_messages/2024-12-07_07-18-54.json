It's made of iron and it's really tall, with these distinctive lattice towers. I think it was built for an exposition or something like that, way back in 1889. Hmm, let's see... was it the Eiffel Tower? Yeah, I think that's it.\n\nNow, about the criticism part. I've heard that when it was first built, some people in Paris weren't too thrilled about it. They probably thought it was ugly or didn't fit in with the rest of the city's architecture. But over time, it grew on them and now it's like a beloved symbol of France and Paris especially.\n\nI remember reading that Gustave Eiffel, the engineer who designed it, faced a lot of opposition from artists and intellectuals at the time. They thought that the tower would be an eyesore and ruin the beauty of Paris. But Eiffel defended his creation and eventually, it became a iconic part of the city's skyline.\n\nIt's interesting how opinions can change over time. Something that was initially met with criticism can later become a cherished landmark. I guess that's the story of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the iconic structure you're referring to is the Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 for the World's Fair, and it has indeed become a beloved symbol of France, despite initial criticisms from some Parisians.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Eiffel Tower}} \\]"
