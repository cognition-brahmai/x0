        "content": "So, let's see here. The train is traveling at different speeds for different periods of time, and we need to find out the total distance it covers. I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time, right? So, maybe I can calculate the distance for each part of the journey separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, the train travels at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, the distance for this part should be 60 miles per hour times 3 hours, which is 180 miles.\n\nThen, it increases its speed to 80 miles per hour for another 2 hours. So, the distance for this part should be 80 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 160 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add these two distances together: 180 miles plus 160 miles, which equals 340 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider, like acceleration or stops? The problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I think assuming constant speeds for those periods is fine.\n\nAlso, I should make sure about the units. The speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, so multiplying them directly gives miles, which is what we want.\n\nSo, the total distance traveled by the train is 340 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{340} \\]"
