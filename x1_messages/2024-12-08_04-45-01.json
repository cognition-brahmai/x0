        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. The factory produces 500 units of product A every day, and each unit of product A requires 3 units of raw material B. So, first, I need to find out how much raw material B is needed per day.\n\nIf one unit of product A requires 3 units of raw material B, then 500 units would require 500 times 3 units of raw material B. That would be 500 * 3 = 1500 units of raw material B per day.\n\nNow, the factory operates 6 days a week. So, to find out the weekly requirement, I need to multiply the daily requirement by 6.\n\nSo, 1500 units per day * 6 days = 9000 units of raw material B per week.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If it's 500 units of product A per day, and each requires 3 units of raw material B, that's indeed 1500 units of raw material B per day. And over 6 days, that would be 1500 * 6 = 9000 units.\n\nI think that makes sense. Is there any other factor I should consider? Like, is there any waste or inefficiency in the production process that might require extra raw material B? The question doesn't mention anything about that, so I'll assume that the factory is operating at perfect efficiency.\n\nAlso, it says the factory operates 6 days a week, so I don't need to account for weekends or holidays. Just the 6 operating days.\n\nSo, the factory needs 9000 units of raw material B per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9000} \\]"
