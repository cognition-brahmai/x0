        "content": "So I've got this question about light passing from glass into air, and I need to find out the angle of refraction. The angle of incidence is 30 degrees, and the refractive index of glass is 1.5. I remember something called Snell's law, which has something to do with refractive indices and sines of angles. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Snell's law. It says that the product of the refractive index of the first medium and the sine of the angle of incidence is equal to the product of the refractive index of the second medium and the sine of the angle of refraction. Mathematically, that's n1 * sin(theta1) = n2 * sin(theta2), where n1 is the refractive index of the first medium, theta1 is the angle of incidence, n2 is the refractive index of the second medium, and theta2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, light is going from glass to air. So, n1 is the refractive index of glass, which is 1.5, and n2 is the refractive index of air. I think the refractive index of air is approximately 1, right? At least, that's what I remember.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, I have:\n\n1.5 * sin(30 degrees) = 1 * sin(theta2)\n\nI need to solve for theta2. First, I should calculate sin(30 degrees). I know that sin(30 degrees) is 0.5.\n\nSo, 1.5 * 0.5 = 1 * sin(theta2)\n\nThat simplifies to 0.75 = sin(theta2)\n\nNow, to find theta2, I need to take the inverse sine (sin^-1) of 0.75.\n\nLet me grab a calculator for that.\n\nOkay, sin^-1(0.75) is approximately 48.59 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 30 degrees\n\nB. 45 degrees\n\nC. 60 degrees\n\nD. 75 degrees\n\nE. 49 degrees\n\nThe closest option to 48.59 degrees is E. 49 degrees.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nn1 = 1.5 (glass)\n\nn2 = 1 (air)\n\ntheta1 = 30 degrees\n\nSnell's law: n1 * sin(theta1) = n2 * sin(theta2)\n\nSo, 1.5 * sin(30) = 1 * sin(theta2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5\n\nTherefore, 1.5 * 0.5 = 0.75\n\nSo, sin(theta2) = 0.75\n\ntheta2 = sin^-1(0.75) \u2248 48.59 degrees\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the options, E. 49 degrees is the closest to 48.59 degrees.\n\nBut let me think about whether this makes sense physically. When light goes from a denser medium (glass, n=1.5) to a less dense medium (air, n=1), it should bend away from the normal. That means the angle of refraction should be larger than the angle of incidence. Here, the angle of incidence is 30 degrees, and 49 degrees is larger than 30 degrees, so that makes sense.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, I can check if any other options could be plausible. Option D is 75 degrees, which is quite large. But according to Snell's law, with n1=1.5 and theta1=30 degrees, the angle of refraction shouldn't be that large. Option C is 60 degrees, which is still larger than 49 degrees, so 75 degrees seems too high.\n\nOption B is 45 degrees, which is less than 49 degrees. But according to my calculation, it's approximately 48.59 degrees, which is closer to 49 degrees than to 45 degrees.\n\nOption A is 30 degrees, which is the angle of incidence, but as the light bends away from the normal, the angle of refraction should be larger than the angle of incidence.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is E. 49 degrees.\n\nOne more thing: I should consider if there's any possibility of total internal reflection, but in this case, since n1 > n2 and the angle of incidence is 30 degrees, which is less than the critical angle (which for n1=1.5 and n2=1 is about 41.8 degrees), so total internal reflection doesn't occur. The light does refract into the air.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be E. 49 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
