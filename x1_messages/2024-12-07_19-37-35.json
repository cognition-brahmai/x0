        "content": "In sports science, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a type of workout that alternates between short bursts of intense exercise and periods of rest or lower-intensity exercise. The primary benefit of HIIT is that it improves both aerobic and anaerobic fitness.\n\nAerobic fitness refers to the body's ability to use oxygen efficiently during exercise, which is important for endurance activities. Anaerobic fitness, on the other hand, refers to the body's ability to perform short bursts of high-intensity exercise without the use of oxygen, which is important for activities that require speed and power.\n\nHIIT workouts typically involve exercises that are performed at a high intensity for a short period of time, followed by a period of rest or lower-intensity exercise. This cycle is repeated several times in a single workout session. Because HIIT workouts are intense, they can be time-efficient, allowing individuals to get a lot of benefit in a shorter amount of time compared to traditional steady-state cardio workouts.\n\nIn addition to improving aerobic and anaerobic fitness, HIIT has also been shown to have other benefits, such as improving insulin sensitivity, burning calories, and increasing metabolism. However, it's important to note that HIIT workouts can be challenging and may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain health conditions or who are new to exercise.\n\nSo, to answer the question, the primary benefit of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is that it improves both aerobic and anaerobic fitness, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Laursen, P.
