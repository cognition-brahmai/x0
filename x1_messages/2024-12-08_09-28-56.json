        "content": "I'm sorry, but the information you provided seems to be incorrect. Mahatma Gandhi was not a British diplomat or military strategist, nor did he use violent tactics. In fact, he was an Indian activist who played a crucial role in India's independence movement against British rule, not French rule. Gandhi is widely known for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, which he called \"satyagraha.\" He advocated for civil rights and peaceful protests, inspiring movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.\n\nMahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, which was then part of the British Empire. He studied law in London and later worked in South Africa, where he first developed his approach to nonviolent protest. Upon returning to India, he became a leader in the Indian National Congress and organized protests against British policies, including the famous Salt March in 1930.\n\nGandhi's efforts were instrumental in India gaining independence in 1947, although he was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by a nationalist who opposed his policies. His date of death does not match the one you provided, which seems to be related to D-Day during World War II.\n\nI recommend checking a reliable source like the Britannica entry you mentioned to get accurate information about Mahatma Gandhi's life and contributions."
