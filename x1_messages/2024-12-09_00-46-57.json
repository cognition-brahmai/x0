        "content": "So I have this problem here: There's a jar with 120 candies, and if I eat 3 candies each day, I need to figure out how many days the candies will last. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I have a total of 120 candies, and every day I eat 3 of them. I want to find out over how many days the candies will run out. So, essentially, I need to divide the total number of candies by the number of candies I eat each day. That should give me the number of days.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal candies = 120\n\nCandies eaten per day = 3\n\nNumber of days = Total candies \u00f7 Candies eaten per day\n\nSo, number of days = 120 \u00f7 3\n\nNow, 120 divided by 3 is 40. So, the candies will last for 40 days.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that makes sense. If I eat 3 candies every day for 40 days, that's 3 times 40, which is 120 candies. Yes, that matches the total number of candies. So, my answer seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using multiplication. If I let the number of days be D, then 3 candies/day times D days should equal 120 candies.\n\nSo, 3D = 120\n\nTo find D, I divide both sides by 3:\n\nD = 120 \u00f7 3\n\nAgain, D = 40 days\n\nThat confirms my previous result.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor to consider. Are there any constraints or additional information in the problem? It seems straightforward: just dividing the total candies by the daily consumption.\n\nI should also consider if the number of candies eaten per day is constant. The problem says \"eat 3 candies each day,\" so it's consistent daily consumption. No need to account for varying amounts.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any remainders. In this case, 120 divided by 3 is exactly 40, with no remainder. So, the candies will be completely used up by day 40.\n\nIf the division had a remainder, I would need to decide how to handle it. For example, if there were 121 candies, divided by 3 per day, that would be 40 days with 1 candy left over. But since 1 is less than 3, I couldn't eat another day's worth of candies. So, in that case, the candies would last for 40 full days, with 1 candy remaining.\n\nBut in this problem, since it divides evenly, I don't have to worry about remainders.\n\nLet me also consider the units. Candies and days are the units here. Making sure that the units make sense in the calculation. Total candies divided by candies per day gives days, which is what I'm looking for.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nFinal answer: The candies will last for 40 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
