        "content": "So I have this problem: \"How many ways are there to arrange the letters in the word 'EXAMPLE'?\" Okay, so I need to find out how many different ways I can arrange these letters. I remember that when all the letters are unique, the number of arrangements is just the factorial of the number of letters. But in \"EXAMPLE,\" there are repeated letters, so I need to account for that.\n\nFirst, let's see how many letters there are in total. \"EXAMPLE\" has 7 letters. So, if all letters were unique, the number of arrangements would be 7 factorial, which is 7! = 5040.\n\nBut in \"EXAMPLE,\" the letter \"E\" appears twice, and the rest of the letters are unique. So, I need to adjust for the repeated \"E\"s. The formula for permutations of a multiset is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n_k!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k \\) are the frequencies of the repeated items.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 7 \\), and since \"E\" appears twice, \\( n_1 = 2 \\). All other letters appear once, so their factorials are 1, which don't affect the denominator.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{7!}{2!} = \\frac{5040}{2} = 2520\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. The word is \"EXAMPLE,\" which has letters: E, X, A, M, P, L, E. So, yes, E appears twice, and the others appear once. So, the formula should indeed be \\( \\frac{7!}{2!} \\), which is 2520.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other repeated letters that I might have missed. Let's list out the letters again: E, X, A, M, P, L, E. No, only E is repeated. So, 2520 is the correct number of unique arrangements.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as selecting positions for the repeated E's. First, choose 2 positions out of 7 for the E's, which can be done in \\( \\binom{7}{2} \\) ways. Then, arrange the remaining 5 unique letters in the remaining 5 positions, which is 5! ways.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements would be:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2} \\times 5! = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} \\times 5! = \\frac{7!}{2! \\times 5!} \\times 5! = \\frac{7!}{2!} = 2520\n\\]\n\nSame answer as before. So, 2520 is indeed the correct number of unique arrangements of the letters in \"EXAMPLE.\"\n\nJust to explore further, suppose the word had more repeated letters. For example, if the word was \"BANANA,\" which has 3 A's and 2 N's, the number of unique arrangements would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6!}{3! \\times 2!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{720}{12} = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, the formula accounts for multiple letters being repeated.\n\nBut in our case, only E is repeated, and it appears twice. So, the calculation remains \\( \\frac{7!}{2!} = 2520 \\).\n\nI think that's the final answer. Unless there's something I'm missing, but I've double-checked it in multiple ways and got the same result each time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2520} \\]"
