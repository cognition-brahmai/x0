Here is something even more unreal, besides the fact that they still dress like that, Guns N\\'Roses new release goes on sale Sunday. It\\'s called \"Chinese Democracy\" and seemed likely that China would be a democracy before Axl Rose ever finished it. It has been in the works for 14 years and Dr. Pepper was so sure that the album wouldn\\'t make this year that the company promised a free soda for every American if it did. Well, starting Sunday for 24 hours, you can download a coupon for a free 20 ounce soda. The coupon is good through February. And we are going to rock on to a little Axl Rose here as the next hour of CNN NEWSROOM starts right now. And hello everyone, I\\'m Kyra Philips live in the CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta. You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. Never a good time to be out of work, or losing a home, but for millions of people in both categories, times just got a little better. President Bush signed a bill this morning that extends unemployment benefits for seven weeks, 13 in states with jobless rates of 6 percent or higher. And for their part, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are putting foreclosures on hold between next Wednesday and January 9th. That applies only to mortgages held or controlled by Fannie and Freddie. Help for the Big Three automakers depends on the turn around plans they submit to Congress. Democratic leaders want to see proof by December 2nd that they won\\'t be throwing good money after bad. Well, buckle up now for a bad ride through a business scheme that went south when the economy went bust. Some of the country\\'s biggest mass transit systems partnered up with banks and AIG in what, for a while, was a win-win proposition. The winds shifted, so to speak. Drew Griffin, of the CNN Special Investigations Unit, here to tell us all about it. Well, it sounds like one of those unintended consequences, then, again, hey, I want my bailout. Everybody is needing is a bailout, let\\'s join in. DREW GRIIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is the little fine print, the little hidden clause in what is turning out to the be a good- sounding deal gone bad, but this is a deal by tax-supported public transit agencies. So, Kyra, guess who? Guess who is about to be taken for a ride? Yes, us, taxpayers. GRIFFIN (voice over): Transit agencies from New York to San Francisco are in a panic, trying to figure out how to survive a go-go financial scheme of the \\'90s that now threatens to derail their trains just as they are seeing record ridership. BEVERLY SCOTT, AMERICAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT ASSN.: Thirty-one of the nation\\'s largest transit systems, including my own MARTA, would be financially crippled in the coming months if nothing is done to resolve this crisis. GRIFFIN: It is a crisis of their own making, deal-making that had transit agencies playing with the U.S. tax code. How? Just like a shell game. Public transit agencies that pay no taxes, started selling tax shelters to banks, that needed a tax break. ( On camera): It worked like this. Banks would buy rail cars from transit agencies like these at Metro in D.C. The banks would immediately lease the rail cars right back to the transit agencies, but now could depreciate the investment; accounting terminology for getting a huge tax break. And they\\'d split the tax break with the agency. (voice over): The problem is to the IRS, it looked and smelled like a tax dodge. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It does look like that. I mean, to some extent that is why Congress made the ruling. GRIFFIN: The first ruling banned U.S. banks from participating in the tax dodge. No problem. The transit agencies then went overseas. Metro, in D.C., sold some rail cars to a Belgium bank. Then in 2003, Congress killed the whole scheme. Which was fine for transit agencies, they still had long-term leases, and their share of the tax shelter was in their pockets. But the banks got burned. They were leasing back railcars they now owned, but could no longer write off. Now the twist of unintended consequences, the deals were almost exclusively backed by the teetering insurance giant, and bailout beneficiary, AIG. JOSEPH HENCHMAN, THE TAX FOUNDATION: A lot of the deals had a clause that said if AIG\\'s credit rating ever dropped, then the banks would either, the transit agencies have to either find a new endorser or terminate the agreement and pay huge termination fees. Transit agencies went ahead to signed these agreements anyway fully knowing they would never fully be able to pay these termination fees. They thought they would never have to, but now they do. GRIFFIN: And now the transit agencies say they need a bailout, too, just don\\'t call it that. JOHN CATOE, GEN. MANAGER, WASHINGTON METRO: This is not a bailout request. This is not a request for a loan of money. This is a request of for federal government, in the process of working with various institutions to support public transit. GRIFFIN: So they are heading to Capitol Hill with their hand out, hoping for hundreds millions of dollars in taxpayer money to cover what the IRS already called an abusive tax scheme. Joe Henchman with The Tax Foundation says, it would be a reward for a really bad deal. HENCHMAN: If Congress and the administration want to spend more money on transit, they should do it through the appropriations process, not through the tax code. GRIFFIN: How much are we talking about, Kyra? For Atlanta? $390 million and D.C., $400 million. There are dozens and dozens of these agencies across - they are going to need to pay out hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in termination fees, and now they are asking us for that money. PHILLIPS: You know, no surprises right now in the economy. Who even came up with this idea in the first place? GRIFFIN: Classic, right? I\\'m in D.C., in a boardroom and I ask that question of all these transit -here\\'s what they do - (CROSSES ARMSACROSS CHEST, POINTING AWAY) GRIFFIN: They say they were encouraged by the federal government, the federal transit agency, to jump into the deals as a way to get immediate income, immediate revenue to work on some private partnered, public partnership things. They all agree now, boy, it was a dumb idea. PHILLIPS: Tell me exactly what it is they did? PHILLIPS: So what happens? GRIFFIN: It was like this. PHILLIPS: So what happens if there is no bailout, and they go ahead and terminate these contracts? GRIFFIN: Well, this is where it is serious. They have no money. They have no way to get the money. You know, like here in Atlanta, you cannot just go out and raise - immediately raise fees on MARTA. So, at a time when all of these people are riding MARTA, because the gas prices were so high -- and you know, ridership is up everywhere - they are going to have to cut services. That is all they can do. Cut service. So, if you think, in New York, if you think those subways are jammed now, wait until they cut out a few more trains or the Metro in D.C. It is just one of those deals where you just like, Ugh, how did this happen? GRIFFIN: In good times it happened, you know? PHILLIPS: Yes. GRIFFIN: Everybody was clicking. PHILLIPS: Thanks, Drew. Well, it seems that everyone has a handout wanting a piece of the $700 billion bailout pie, but what about homeowners? Where is their lifeline? CNN Personal Finance Expert Gerri Willis will take a look. And the nation\\'s top law enforcer is now back on the job after leaving Washington and a hospital there, just a couple of hours ago. Looking at this video, you would not have thought that anything was wrong with Attorney General Michael Mukasey. But this was Mukasey last night slurring his words just before collapsing during a speech at a Washington hotel. Justice Department now says the attorney general is fully recovered. GINA TALAMONA, SPOKESWOMAN, JUSTICE DEPT: The test results are in, everything looks great. The attorney general had a CT scan. It was normal. He had a clear MRI. They ruled out TIA, which is transient ischemic attack, which can be associated with stroke. He had a stress test. It was completely normal. The doctors said he is in good shape and basically that he beat the machine. He also had a stress echocardiogram, which was also completely normal. He been basically given a clean bill of health. PHILLIPS: Well, Mukasey echoed those words in a written statement to his staff. He said, \"As you may heard, I collapsed briefly last night at the conclusion of a speech. All tests at the hospital have come back with good results, and I feel fine.\" Well, we might be calling her madam secretary before long. We are getting new information today that Hillary Clinton is closer to a Cabinet nomination. Let\\'s get straight to Jessica Yellin in Chicago, where President-Elect Barack Obama\\'s team has set up shop -- Hey, Jessica. JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Kyra. Well, Barack Obama\\'s aides tell us at CNN that she is on track, Senator Clinton, to be nominated for secretary of State sometime after Thanksgiving. What this means, according to an aide I have spoken with, is that Senator Clinton has cleared major hurdles in the vetting process. This after her husband, former President Bill Clinton made some significant concessions agreeing, for example, that if his wife should become secretary of State, he would be willing to remove himself from day-to-day responsibilities for his foundation, which has ties to donors around the world, countries, major governments, and it could potentially pose a conflict of interest. So he is clearly done what he can to clear a way for her to accept this job. The big question is, does she want to accept it? That is what we don\\'t know. Because just as we are learning this from the Obama team, we are hearing from aides on Capitol Hill that there is a new leadership position available to Senator Clinton, if she should choose to stay in the Senate. So a new expanded role in the Senate, one hand, secretary of State, possibly, on the other. Big choices for Senator Clinton and it does seem, at this point, the ball is in her court, Kyra. PHILLIPS: All right. Well, we have reports that President-Elect Obama had his cell phone breached, so what is the latest on that? YELLIN: The latest is that it was something that happened to his cell phone, he no longer uses. There does not seem to be a high degree of concern in the Obama transition team. They say some of these Verizon employees may have improperly looked at the phone numbers he has called in the past. They could have looked at, you know, copied down who he called. But this is no longer an active phone. They never listened into his calls or his voice mail, so at this point it sounds like an investigation happening inside Verizon to determine what went wrong there, but nothing broader than that. Still, not great. PHILLIPS: Yes, nobody wants their privacy invaded like that. Jessica, thanks. Teaches us all a lesson. Well, Barack Obama will have to deal with a very real, ongoing and potentially devastating threat when he takes office. Our Homeland Security Correspondent Jeanne Meserve sends a memo to the president- elect. JEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mr. President, the White House you will soon occupy, the Pentagon, and virtually every agency of government, has come under cyber attack. The extent of the hacking may never be known. Experts, including the nation\\'s top intelligent official, say you have to secure the country against this threat, and fast. MIKE MCCONNELL, DIRECTOR, NAT\\'L INTELLIGENCE: The United States is the most vulnerable nation on Earth to cyber attack, the most vulnerable. It is a simple reason. We are the most dependent. MESERVE: Cyber attacks could halt transportation, freeze finances, and knock out water, sewer and most frighteningly, electricity. SCOTT BORG, U.S. CYBER CONSEQUENCES UNIT: If you shutdown the electric power for a third of the country for three months, this causes tens of thousands of people to die. It causes major social dislocations. It is just a level of damage that we have only talked about before when we have been discussing limited nuclear exchanges. MESERVE: The U.S. must now launch a cyber race, experts say, training top-notch cyber talent in our graduate schools, encouraging development of more security computer software and hardware and enlisting in the fight, businesses who control so many of the country\\'s critical computer systems. SAMI SAYDJARI, CYBER DEFENSE AGENCY: We need to recruit the private sector folks as part of what I will call a cyber militia, to be standing ready to defend our country against strategic attack. MESERVE: Financial incentives and regulation should be used as tools many experts say, to motivate businesses to protect critical infrastructure and intellectual property. The risk of doing nothing, they say, is too high. ( On camera): The web is a global phenomenon and experts say international cooperation on cyber security is a must. Experts also say there has to be a coordinated approach across the U.S. government and the one place with the authority and the clout to lead the effort and get results is the White House. Jeanne Meserve, CNN, Washington. PHILLIPS: What happened in Dallas 45 years ago is in black and white for most of us, and told second or third hand, but for one man, we are going to talk with, it is a vivid memory, personal and in color. And in these tough economic times, one of our viewers writes, \"I am concerned about grandson\\'s Coverdell fund and my granddaughter\\'s college funds. I see both of those dropping. What should I do? Straight ahead we will hear what personal finance analyst Suze Orman has to say about that.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
