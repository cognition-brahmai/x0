        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 houses in the village, and each house has a number of children equal to its house number. So, house number 1 has 1 child, house number 2 has 2 children, and this pattern continues up to house number 100, which has 100 children.\n\nThe question is asking for the total number of children living in the even-numbered houses. So, I need to add up the number of children in houses 2, 4, 6, ..., up to house 100.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many even-numbered houses there are. Since the houses are numbered from 1 to 100, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a_1 is 2, the common difference d is 2, and the last term a_n is 100.\n\nThe number of terms n in this sequence can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n100 = 2 + (n - 1) * 2\n\nLet's solve for n:\n\n100 - 2 = (n - 1) * 2\n\n98 = (n - 1) * 2\n\nn - 1 = 98 / 2\n\nn - 1 = 49\n\nn = 50\n\nSo, there are 50 even-numbered houses.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the children in these 50 houses. Since the number of children in each even-numbered house corresponds to the house number, which is even, the number of children in these houses is 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.\n\nThis is again an arithmetic sequence with first term 2, common difference 2, and last term 100.\n\nThe sum S of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\nS = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 50/2 * (2 + 100)\n\nS = 25 * 102\n\nS = 2550\n\nTherefore, the total number of children living in the even-numbered houses is 2550.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2550} \\]"
