However, to strictly adhere to using exactly five palindromic words, here's an adjusted version:\n\nThere once was a civic so neat,\nWhose level was always so neat.\nAt noon, it would gleam,\nWith rotor blades keen,\nA palindromic sight, truly sweet.\n\nPalindromic words used: civic, level, noon, rotor, and level (repeated). To ensure five unique palindromic words:\n\nThere once was a civic so sly,\nWhose level was always so high.\nAt noon, it would spin,\nWith rotor and rev,\nA palindromic delight, oh my!\n\nPalindromic words: civic, level, noon, rotor, and rev (short for revolver, which is a palindrome)."
