However, based on descriptions and historical accounts, ancient parchment is often characterized as being thin, smooth, and slightly translucent. It's made from animal skin, typically calf, sheep, or goat, which has been treated with lime and stretched to create a writing surface. Over time, parchment can become brittle and prone to cracking, especially if not stored properly. The texture might feel delicate and may have some natural variations depending on the quality of the skin and the preparation process."
