I need to add up all the even numbers between 10 and 50, including 10 and 50 themselves.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the even numbers in that range to make sure I don't miss any. Starting from 10, the even numbers would be: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50. That seems right.\n\nNow, adding all these up manually would take a while and be prone to error, especially since there are quite a few numbers here. I wonder if there's a smarter way to do this.\n\nI remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: sum = (number of terms) \u00d7 (first term + last term)/2. Hmm, does this apply here? Well, an arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. In this case, the difference between consecutive even numbers is 2, which is constant. So, yes, this seems applicable.\n\nFirst, I need to find the number of terms. I have the first term (a = 10) and the last term (l = 50), and the common difference (d = 2). The formula for the number of terms (n) in an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nn = (l - a)/d + 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nn = (50 - 10)/2 + 1 = (40)/2 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21\n\nSo, there are 21 even numbers between 10 and 50 inclusive.\n\nNow, using the sum formula:\n\nsum = n \u00d7 (a + l)/2 = 21 \u00d7 (10 + 50)/2 = 21 \u00d7 (60)/2 = 21 \u00d7 30 = 630\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, (50 - 10)/2 + 1 = 40/2 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21 terms.\n\nThen, sum = 21 \u00d7 (10 + 50)/2 = 21 \u00d7 60/2 = 21 \u00d7 30 = 630.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be sure, maybe I can verify this by adding a few terms or using another method.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of the first n even numbers, which is n(n+1). But in this case, the first even number isn't 2, it's 10, so that formula might not apply directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can adjust it. The sum of the first n even numbers is n(n+1). If I consider the sequence starting from 2, but I'm starting from 10, which is the 5th even number (since 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).\n\nSimilarly, 50 is the 25th even number (since 2*25=50).\n\nSo, the sum of even numbers from 10 to 50 inclusive would be the sum of the first 25 even numbers minus the sum of the first 4 even numbers (since 10 is the 5th even number).\n\nSum from 2 to 50 = 25*(25+1) = 25*26 = 650\n\nSum from 2 to 8 = 4*(4+1) = 4*5 = 20\n\nTherefore, sum from 10 to 50 = 650 - 20 = 630\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that gives me more confidence that 630 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can try adding a few terms manually to confirm.\n\nLet's see, adding the numbers in pairs from both ends:\n\n10 + 50 = 60\n\n12 + 48 = 60\n\n14 + 46 = 60\n\n16 + 44 = 60\n\n18 + 42 = 60\n\n20 + 40 = 60\n\n22 + 38 = 60\n\n24 + 36 = 60\n\n26 + 34 = 60\n\n28 + 32 = 60\n\nAnd then there's 30 in the middle, which is 30.\n\nSo, that's 10 pairs of 60 plus one 30, which is 10*60 + 30 = 600 + 30 = 630.\n\nAgain, the same answer. Looks like it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series again, but this time confirming the number of terms.\n\nNumber of terms n = 21, first term a = 10, last term l = 50.\n\nSum = n/2 * (a + l) = 21/2 * (10 + 50) = 10.5 * 60 = 630.\n\nWait, but earlier I had n \u00d7 (a + l)/2 = 21 \u00d7 60/2 = 21 \u00d7 30 = 630. Same thing, just written differently.\n\nEither way, all methods lead to 630.\n\nI think that's pretty conclusive. The sum of all even integers from 10 to 50 inclusive is 630.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{630} \\]"
