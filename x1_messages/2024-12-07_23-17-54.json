Therefore, the farmer has 8 cows left alive.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about this again. The phrase \"all but 8 die\" could be a bit tricky. Let's break it down.\n\nIf the farmer has 15 cows and \"all but 8 die,\" it means that all cows except for 8 die. So, the number of cows that die is 15 minus 8, which is 7. Therefore, the farmer has 8 cows left.\n\nAlternatively, if \"all but 8 die,\" it could also be interpreted as only 8 cows survive. So, again, the farmer has 8 cows left.\n\nI think the answer is 8 cows.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
