        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (8 - 3 * 2) / (1 + 2^2). First, I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with the numerator: 8 - 3 * 2. According to PEMDAS, I should do the multiplication before the subtraction. So, 3 * 2 is 6. Then, 8 - 6 is 2.\n\nNow, the denominator: 1 + 2^2. Again, exponents come before addition. So, 2^2 is 4. Then, 1 + 4 is 5.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to 2 / 5, which is 0.4.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet's look at the numerator again: 8 - 3 * 2. Multiplication first: 3 * 2 = 6. Then, 8 - 6 = 2. That seems correct.\n\nDenominator: 1 + 2^2. Exponent first: 2^2 = 4. Then, 1 + 4 = 5. That's correct too.\n\nSo, 2 divided by 5 is indeed 0.4.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expression as a fraction, it would be 2/5, which can also be written as 0.4.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.4} \\]"
