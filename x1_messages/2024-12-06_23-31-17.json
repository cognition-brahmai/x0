        "content": "So there's this problem about marbles and probabilities. Let me see if I can figure this out. There's a box with 3 red marbles, 4 blue marbles, and 5 green marbles. So, in total, there are 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 marbles in the box.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that if I pick one marble at random, it's not green. Okay, so first, I need to understand what probability means. Probability is basically the chances of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of marbles, which is 12. Now, the favorable outcomes are the ones where I pick a marble that is not green. So, that means I can pick either a red or a blue marble.\n\nThere are 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles, so the total number of favorable outcomes is 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a marble that is not green is 7/12.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by calculating the probability of picking a green marble and then subtracting it from 1, since the probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of it happening.\n\nLet me try that. The probability of picking a green marble is the number of green marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is 5/12.\n\nSo, the probability of not picking a green marble would be 1 - 5/12 = 7/12.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the probability is 7/12.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure there aren't any other factors to consider. Are the marbles different in size or anything like that? The problem doesn't say, so I'm assuming they're all identical except for their color.\n\nAlso, it says \"randomly pick one marble,\" so each marble should have an equal chance of being picked.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 7/12 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{12}} \\]"
