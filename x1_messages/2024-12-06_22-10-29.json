        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: \"A square garden has an area of 256 square meters. If you walk around the perimeter of the garden once, how many meters have you walked?\" Okay, so I need to find out the perimeter of the square garden given its area.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. So, if the area is 256 square meters, that means side squared equals 256. I need to find the length of one side. To do that, I should take the square root of the area.\n\nSo, side = square root of 256. Let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, so the side length is 16 meters.\n\nNow, the perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter P is 4 times the length of one side.\n\nSo, P = 4 \u00d7 side = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 meters.\n\nTherefore, if you walk around the perimeter once, you would have walked 64 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Just to double-check. Maybe using formulas or another approach.\n\nAnother way: the area A = side\u00b2, so side = \u221aA = \u221a256 = 16 meters.\n\nPerimeter P = 4 \u00d7 side = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 meters.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember the formula for the perimeter of a square, I could think about it in terms of the definition of perimeter, which is the total length around the shape. Since a square has four equal sides, adding up four sides of 16 meters each would give me 64 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to walk around the garden, I would be walking along all four sides, so it's like adding up the lengths of all four sides.\n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine a square with each side being 16 meters. Starting at one corner, I walk 16 meters to the next corner, then another 16 meters to the next, and so on, until I return to the starting point. So, 16 meters four times is 64 meters.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using the diagonal or something, but I don't think that's necessary here because we're given the area and need to find the perimeter.\n\nWait, just out of curiosity, what if it wasn't a square garden but a rectangular garden with the same area? How would that affect the perimeter?\n\nFor a rectangle, the area is length times width, and the perimeter is 2 times (length plus width). If the area is 256 square meters, there are multiple possible combinations of length and width that would give that area, and each would have a different perimeter.\n\nFor example, if the length is 32 meters and the width is 8 meters, the area is 32 \u00d7 8 = 256 square meters, and the perimeter would be 2 \u00d7 (32 + 8) = 2 \u00d7 40 = 80 meters.\n\nComparatively, the square has a smaller perimeter for the same area. That's interesting, but not directly relevant to the problem at hand.\n\nBack to the original problem: the garden is square, with an area of 256 square meters, so the side length is 16 meters, and the perimeter is 64 meters.\n\nI think that's the answer: 64 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]"
