        "content": "Ah, that's a classic! The British rock band you're referring to is The Who. \"Tommy\" is indeed a groundbreaking concept album that tells the story of a boy named Tommy Walker, who, as you mentioned, is deaf, dumb, and blind but becomes a pinball champion. It was released in 1969 and is considered one of the pioneering works in the genre of rock operas. The album features iconic tracks like \"Pinball Wizard,\" \"See Me, Feel Me,\" and \"We're Not Gonna Take It.\" The Who's innovative approach to storytelling through music has left a lasting impact on the world of rock and pop culture as a whole."
