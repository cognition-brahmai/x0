        "content": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door\u2014\nOnly this and nothing more.\"\n\nAh, but 'twas the aroma of coffee, rich and bold,\nFrom the pot that sat beside me, black as a raven's shroud.\nIt beckoned me, that brew so fine, with a scent both deep and divine,\nIn the stillness of the night, it filled the room, without a sound.\n\nQuoth the coffee, \"Nevermore shall you sleep, for I am here,\nAwakening your senses to the world, so clear and dear.\"\nSo I drank, and as the liquid warmth spread through me, I was reborn,\nFrom the slumber of the night, to the day's awakening morn.\n\nThus, the coffee's siren call, in the darkness did enthrall,\nDrawing me from dreams to reality's harsher toll.\nYet, in its embrace, I found solace, a moment's reprieve from life's travails,\nA pause in the storm, a calm in the gales.\n\nSo, to coffee, I shall ever be true, in this life and the next, too,\nFor it is my muse, my friend, my solace, my all.\nQuoth the coffee, \"Nevermore shall you doubt, for I am here to keep watch,\nOver your weary soul, through the darkest of nights, without catch.\"\n\nThus, in Poe's somber style, I've penned this limerick, a tribute to coffee's might,\nA beverage so dark, yet so full of light.\nIn its depths, one may find reflections of the soul's deepest fears and desires,\nA cup of mystery, like the raven's obscure fires.\n\nBut in this case, it's not the raven at the door, but the coffee's inviting allure,\nCalling to the poet within, to create and to endure.\nSo, here's to coffee, the muse of the night, guiding us through the darkest fight,\nWith every sip, a new verse is written, a new story takes flight."
