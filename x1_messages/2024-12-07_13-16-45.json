        "content": "So I'm trying to figure out how many extra doctors the hospital needs to hire for their ER to make sure that 95% of the time, all patients can be seen within their first hour of arrival. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current situation:\n\n- The ER gets an average of 150 patients per day, with a standard deviation of 20 patients.\n\n- There are 15 doctors working in the ER.\n\n- Each doctor can see an average of 12 patients per shift.\n\n- The hospital operates on 8-hour shifts.\n\n- There are always at least two doctors present during any given shift.\n\nMy goal is to find out how many more doctors should be hired so that 95% of the time, all patients can be seen within their first hour of arrival.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the patient arrival rate per hour because we're concerned with the first hour of arrival. Since there are 150 patients per day and assuming the hospital operates 24 hours a day, the hourly arrival rate would be:\n\n150 patients / 24 hours = 6.25 patients per hour on average.\n\nBut wait, is the hospital open 24 hours a day? ERs typically are. So, 6.25 patients per hour seems low, but maybe the standard deviation is per day, so I need to consider the variability as well.\n\nHowever, perhaps the hospital operates with shifts, and the patient arrival rate varies throughout the day. But for simplicity, maybe I can assume that patients arrive uniformly throughout the day.\n\nBut actually, patient arrivals in ERs are usually modeled with a Poisson distribution because they represent random events over time.\n\nGiven that, the number of patients arriving in a given hour would have a Poisson distribution with a rate parameter \u03bb equal to the average number of patients per hour.\n\nSo, \u03bb = 150 patients / 24 hours = 6.25 patients per hour.\n\nBut, the problem states that the average is 150 patients per day with a standard deviation of 20 patients per day. In a Poisson distribution, the standard deviation is sqrt(\u03bb), which for \u03bb=150 would be sqrt(150)\u224812.25, but here it's given as 20, which suggests that the arrivals may not be purely Poissonian, or perhaps the variability is higher than expected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the daily patient count follows a normal distribution with mean 150 and standard deviation 20.\n\nBut since we're looking at hourly arrivals, and there are 24 hours in a day, perhaps I can assume that the hourly arrivals are normally distributed with mean 150/24=6.25 and standard deviation 20/sqrt(24)\u22484.08.\n\nWait, but standard deviation doesn't scale down by sqrt(t) in the way I'm thinking. Actually, for Poisson processes, the variance is equal to the mean, so daily variance would be 150, and standard deviation sqrt(150)\u224812.25, but here it's given as 20, which doesn't align.\n\nMaybe the arrivals are not strictly Poisson, and there's overdispersion. Alternatively, perhaps the variability is due to different arrival rates at different times of the day.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe for now, I'll proceed with the assumption that patient arrivals per hour are normally distributed with mean 6.25 and standard deviation 20/sqrt(24)\u22484.08.\n\nNow, regarding doctor capacity:\n\nEach doctor can see 12 patients per shift, and shifts are 8 hours long. So, per hour, each doctor can see 12 patients / 8 hours = 1.5 patients per hour.\n\nWith 15 doctors, total capacity per hour would be 15 doctors * 1.5 patients per hour = 22.5 patients per hour.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? If each doctor can see 12 patients in an 8-hour shift, that's 12 patients per shift.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider how many doctors are present per hour.\n\nGiven that there are always at least two doctors present during any given shift, but with 15 doctors, probably the doctors are distributed across different shifts.\n\nAssuming that the hospital has three shifts per day: morning, afternoon, and night, each 8 hours.\n\nSo, if there are 15 doctors, and three shifts, then on average, 15/3=5 doctors per shift.\n\nBut the problem says there are always at least two doctors present during any given shift, so perhaps each shift has at least two doctors, and the remaining are distributed.\n\nBut maybe I should assume that during each shift, there are a certain number of doctors present.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"there are always at least two doctors present during any given shift.\"\n\nSo, minimum of two doctors per shift, but total of 15 doctors working in the ER.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of doctor availability per hour.\n\nIf each doctor works an 8-hour shift and can see 12 patients per shift, then per hour, each doctor can see 12 patients / 8 hours = 1.5 patients per hour.\n\nSo, if there are D doctors available per hour, then the total patient capacity per hour is 1.5 * D.\n\nOur goal is to have enough doctors such that 95% of the time, the number of patients arriving in an hour is less than or equal to the capacity of the doctors per hour.\n\nIn other words, we want P(X \u2264 1.5D) \u2265 0.95, where X is the number of patients arriving in an hour.\n\nGiven that X is normally distributed with mean 6.25 and standard deviation 4.08, as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but can patient arrivals be negative? A normal distribution can take negative values, which doesn't make sense for patient counts.\n\nMaybe I should use a Poisson distribution after all, despite the standard deviation not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a normal approximation to the Poisson distribution, but with the given standard deviation of 20 per day, it's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the number of patients arriving in an hour as a normal random variable with mean 6.25 and standard deviation that is consistent with the daily standard deviation.\n\nGiven that daily patient arrivals are normal with mean 150 and std dev 20, then hourly arrivals would be normal with mean 150/24=6.25 and std dev 20/sqrt(24)\u22484.08, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, X ~ N(6.25, 4.08^2)\n\nWe want P(X \u2264 1.5D) \u2265 0.95.\n\nTo find the required D, we can standardize the normal variable:\n\nP(X \u2264 1.5D) = P((X - 6.25)/4.08 \u2264 (1.5D - 6.25)/4.08) \u2265 0.95\n\nLooking up the standard normal distribution table, the z-score corresponding to P(Z \u2264 z) = 0.95 is z = 1.645.\n\nTherefore, (1.5D - 6.25)/4.08 \u2265 1.645\n\nSolving for D:\n\n1.5D - 6.25 \u2265 1.645 * 4.08\n\n1.5D - 6.25 \u2265 6.70\n\n1.5D \u2265 12.95\n\nD \u2265 12.95 / 1.5\n\nD \u2265 8.6333...\n\nSince the number of doctors must be an integer, we round up to D = 9 doctors per hour.\n\nNow, currently, there are 15 doctors working in the ER, but I need to determine how many are present per hour.\n\nGiven that shifts are 8 hours long, and assuming doctors work one shift per day, then during their shift, they are present for 8 hours.\n\nSo, if there are 15 doctors, and shifts are 8 hours, then the number of doctors per hour would be 15 doctors / 3 shifts = 5 doctors per shift, but since shifts are 8 hours, that's 5 doctors per 8 hours, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nIf there are 15 doctors and 3 shifts per day, then per shift, there are 15/3=5 doctors.\n\nBut the problem states that there are always at least two doctors present during any given shift.\n\nSo, per shift, there are at least two doctors, but apparently, there are five doctors per shift.\n\nTherefore, per hour, since a shift is 8 hours, and 5 doctors are working that shift, the number of doctors per hour is 5.\n\nBut, wait, all 5 doctors are present for the entire 8-hour shift, so per hour, all 5 are present.\n\nWait, no, if it's a shift system where doctors work different shifts, but the hospital ensures that at least two doctors are always present.\n\nSo, for example, during the morning shift, there might be 5 doctors on duty, similarly for the afternoon and night shifts.\n\nBut within a shift, doctors might take breaks or have overlapping shifts, but the problem says that there are always at least two doctors present during any given shift.\n\nSo, perhaps per hour, there are at least two doctors present, but on average, there are more.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the current number of doctors per hour is 5, as 15 doctors / 3 shifts = 5 doctors per shift, and per hour, it's the same.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated that to meet the 95% target, D needs to be at least 9 doctors per hour.\n\nSo, additional doctors required would be 9 - 5 = 4 doctors per hour.\n\nBut, since doctors work 8-hour shifts, hiring additional doctors would increase the total number of doctors per shift.\n\nSo, if currently, there are 5 doctors per shift, and we need to increase it to 9 doctors per hour, which is 9 doctors per shift, since the shift is 8 hours.\n\nWait, no, per hour, it's 9 doctors, but since the shift is 8 hours, perhaps I need to calculate the total number of doctors needed per day.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the total patient arrival per day and the total capacity per day.\n\nDaily patient arrivals are normally distributed with mean 150 and standard deviation 20.\n\nEach doctor can see 12 patients per shift, and there are 3 shifts per day, so each doctor can see 12 patients per day.\n\nWith 15 doctors, total capacity is 15 * 12 = 180 patients per day.\n\nBut the arrivals are 150 patients per day on average, so currently, the capacity is higher than the arrival rate.\n\nBut the issue is about the wait times within the first hour of arrival, so it's not just about daily capacity, but about hourly capacity.\n\nPerhaps I need to think in terms of Little's Law or queueing theory.\n\nLittle's Law states that L = \u03bbW, where L is the average number of patients in the system, \u03bb is the arrival rate, and W is the average time spent in the system.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that directly helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as an M/M/c queue, where c is the number of servers (doctors), arrivals are Markovian (Poisson process), and service times are exponentially distributed.\n\nIn an M/M/c queue, the probability that an arriving patient has to wait is given by the Erlang C formula.\n\nThe Erlang C formula is:\n\nPw = ( (c\u03c1)^c / c! ) / [ (c\u03c1)^c / c! ) + \u2211 from n=0 to c-1 of ( (c\u03c1)^n / n! ) ] * (1 / (1 - \u03c1))\n\nwhere \u03c1 = \u03bb / (c\u03bc), with \u03bb being the arrival rate, \u03bc being the service rate per doctor, and c being the number of doctors.\n\nThe average waiting time in the queue is Wq = Pw / [c\u03bc - \u03bb]\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the waiting time decreases as the number of servers (doctors) increases.\n\nI need to find the number of doctors such that 95% of the time, all patients arriving in an hour can be seen within that hour.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can set up the condition that the capacity per hour is greater than or equal to the 95th percentile of the hourly arrival distribution.\n\nSo, find D such that capacity per hour, which is D * 1.5 \u2265 the 95th percentile of hourly arrivals.\n\nEarlier, I modeled hourly arrivals as N(6.25, 4.08^2).\n\nThe 95th percentile of a normal distribution can be found using the formula:\n\nx = \u03bc + z * \u03c3, where z is the z-score for the desired percentile.\n\nFor the 95th percentile, z = 1.645.\n\nSo, x = 6.25 + 1.645 * 4.08 \u2248 6.25 + 6.70 \u2248 12.95 patients.\n\nTherefore, the capacity needs to be at least 12.95 patients per hour.\n\nGiven that each doctor can see 1.5 patients per hour, the number of doctors required is D \u2265 12.95 / 1.5 \u2248 8.63, so D = 9 doctors per hour.\n\nNow, currently, with 15 doctors per day and 3 shifts, that's 5 doctors per shift.\n\nAssuming that all 5 doctors are present for the entire shift, then per hour, all 5 are present.\n\nTherefore, current capacity is 5 doctors * 1.5 patients per hour = 7.5 patients per hour.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, we need 9 doctors per hour to handle 12.95 patients per hour.\n\nSo, additional doctors required = 9 - 5 = 4 doctors per hour.\n\nHowever, since doctors work 8-hour shifts, hiring 4 additional doctors would mean 9 doctors per shift, which would provide 9 * 1.5 = 13.5 patients per hour capacity, which meets the requirement of 12.95.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this satisfies the 95% criterion.\n\nLet me verify.\n\nWith D=9 doctors per hour, capacity = 9 * 1.5 = 13.5 patients per hour.\n\nThe 95th percentile of hourly arrivals is 12.95 patients.\n\nSince 13.5 > 12.95, this should meet the requirement.\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs to hire 4 additional doctors.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that currently, with 15 doctors, there are 5 per shift, and I'm suggesting to increase to 9 per shift, which would require hiring 4 additional doctors per shift, meaning 4 * 3 = 12 additional doctors overall.\n\nBut that seems like a lot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not all doctors are dedicated solely to the ER; perhaps some are shared with other departments.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the total additional capacity needed per hour and then convert that into the number of additional doctors required.\n\nFrom the earlier calculation, the additional capacity needed is 12.95 - 7.5 = 5.45 patients per hour.\n\nEach additional doctor can handle 1.5 patients per hour, so number of additional doctors needed is 5.45 / 1.5 \u2248 3.63, which rounds up to 4 doctors, as I previously calculated.\n\nTherefore, the hospital should hire 4 additional doctors to meet the 95% target.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure about the shift structure and how many doctors are actually present per hour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the entire day's operations.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nAssume that the hospital operates 24 hours a day.\n\nGiven that, and with 8-hour shifts, there are three shifts per day.\n\nIf the hospital has 15 doctors, and each works one shift per day, then per shift, there are 15 / 3 = 5 doctors.\n\nDuring each shift, these 5 doctors are present for the entire 8 hours.\n\nTherefore, per hour, all 5 doctors are present.\n\nThus, the hourly capacity is 5 doctors * 1.5 patients per hour = 7.5 patients per hour.\n\nFrom the earlier calculation, to meet the 95% target, the capacity needs to be at least 12.95 patients per hour.\n\nTherefore, the number of doctors required per hour is ceil(12.95 / 1.5) = ceil(8.63) = 9 doctors.\n\nSo, per shift, the hospital needs to have 9 doctors present.\n\nCurrently, they have 5 doctors per shift.\n\nTherefore, they need to hire additional doctors to increase the number per shift from 5 to 9, which means hiring 4 additional doctors per shift.\n\nGiven that there are three shifts per day, the total additional doctors needed are 4 per shift * 3 shifts = 12 doctors.\n\nBut this seems like a lot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some doctors work multiple shifts or are shared with other departments.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that some doctors might work overlapping shifts.\n\nBut that complicates things further.\n\nPerhaps the hospital could consider having more doctors per shift to meet the hourly capacity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can look into ways to increase the productivity of the current doctors, such as improving processes or reducing non-clinical tasks.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for how many additional doctors should be hired.\n\nBased on the earlier calculations, it seems that hiring 4 additional doctors per shift (total of 12 doctors) would be required to meet the 95% target.\n\nHowever, perhaps there is a more efficient way to schedule the doctors to optimize coverage.\n\nFor example, if doctors could work overlapping shifts, then fewer additional doctors might be needed.\n\nBut without more information on the shift scheduling, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hospital could consider hiring per diem or on-call doctors to handle peak hours.\n\nBut again, that's beyond the scope of the question.\n\nGiven the information provided, and assuming that each shift requires 9 doctors to meet the hourly capacity, and currently, there are 5 doctors per shift, the hospital needs to hire 4 additional doctors per shift.\n\nTherefore, the total additional doctors needed are 4 per shift * 3 shifts = 12 doctors.\n\nBut this seems like a significant increase from the current 15 doctors.\n\nPerhaps there is a flaw in my earlier assumptions.\n\nLet me double-check the patient arrival rate.\n\nIf the ER receives 150 patients per day on average, and the standard deviation is 20 patients per day, and assuming 24 hours per day, then the average hourly arrival rate is 150 / 24 = 6.25 patients per hour.\n\nBut, the standard deviation per hour would be 20 / sqrt(24) \u2248 4.08 patients per hour.\n\nSo, the coefficient of variation (CV) is std dev / mean = 4.08 / 6.25 \u2248 0.653.\n\nIn queueing theory, higher variability in arrival rates leads to longer waiting times.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the current system is not able to handle the variability in arrivals, hence the need for more doctors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the service time per patient is too long, and there's room to improve that.\n\nBut based on the information provided, I'll stick with the earlier conclusion that the hospital needs to hire 12 additional doctors to meet the 95% target.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet's think about the total number of patients that need to be seen within the first hour.\n\nGiven that 95% of the time, the number of patients arriving in an hour should be covered by the doctors' capacity.\n\nSo, find the 95th percentile of the hourly arrival distribution.\n\nAs before, assuming X ~ N(6.25, 4.08^2), the 95th percentile is approximately 12.95 patients.\n\nNow, each doctor can see 1.5 patients per hour.\n\nSo, the number of doctors required is ceil(12.95 / 1.5) = ceil(8.63) = 9 doctors per hour.\n\nCurrently, with 15 doctors and 3 shifts, that's 5 doctors per shift, providing 7.5 patients per hour capacity.\n\nTherefore, additional doctors needed per hour are 9 - 5 = 4.\n\nGiven that doctors work 8-hour shifts, hiring 4 additional doctors per shift would mean having 9 doctors per shift.\n\nThus, total additional doctors needed are 4 per shift * 3 shifts = 12 doctors.\n\nAlternatively, if some doctors work multiple shifts, the total additional doctors required might be less.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that hiring 12 additional doctors would be necessary to meet the 95% target.\n\nHowever, this seems like a substantial increase, and perhaps the hospital can consider other strategies to improve efficiency before hiring that many additional doctors.\n\nBut since the question specifically asks for how many additional doctors should be hired, and based on the calculations, the answer is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
