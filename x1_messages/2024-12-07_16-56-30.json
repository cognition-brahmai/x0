        "content": "So the company has a 25% profit margin, and they sold an item for $100. I need to find out what their cost price was for that item.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a profit margin is. Profit margin is the percentage of profit relative to the selling price. So, if it's a 25% profit margin, that means that 25% of the selling price is profit.\n\nLet me denote the cost price as CP and the selling price as SP. Here, SP is given as $100.\n\nProfit is SP minus CP, and profit margin is (profit / SP) * 100%.\n\nGiven that profit margin is 25%, I can set up the equation:\n\n( SP - CP ) / SP = 0.25\n\nPlugging in SP = 100:\n\n(100 - CP) / 100 = 0.25\n\nNow, I can solve for CP:\n\n100 - CP = 0.25 * 100\n\n100 - CP = 25\n\nCP = 100 - 25\n\nCP = $75\n\nSo, the cost price was $75.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's check.\n\nIf the cost price is $75 and they sold it for $100, the profit is $25.\n\nProfit margin is (25 / 100) * 100% = 25%, which matches the given profit margin.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of people confusing profit margin with markup. Markup is the profit relative to the cost price, not the selling price. So, markup would be (SP - CP) / CP.\n\nBut in this case, it's clearly stating profit margin, which is based on selling price.\n\nSo, my answer should be $75.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that selling price is equal to cost price plus profit, and profit is 25% of the selling price.\n\nSo, SP = CP + (0.25 * SP)\n\nGiven SP is $100:\n\n100 = CP + (0.25 * 100)\n\n100 = CP + 25\n\nCP = 100 - 25 = $75\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as SP = CP / (1 - profit margin)\n\nBecause profit is SP - CP, and profit margin is (SP - CP)/SP = 1 - (CP/SP), so CP/SP = 1 - profit margin.\n\nTherefore, CP = SP * (1 - profit margin)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nCP = 100 * (1 - 0.25) = 100 * 0.75 = $75\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think $75 is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the profit margin was on cost price instead.\n\nIf it were a 25% markup on cost price, then SP = CP + 0.25 * CP = 1.25 * CP\n\nThen, CP = SP / 1.25 = 100 / 1.25 = $80\n\nBut that would be different from the previous answer, and it's because this is markup, not profit margin.\n\nThe problem specified profit margin, not markup, so the first answer of $75 is correct.\n\nIt's important not to confuse profit margin with markup.\n\nProfit margin is profit divided by selling price, while markup is profit divided by cost price.\n\nIn this case, since it's profit margin, the cost price is $75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
