        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has 1000 kg of apples, and he sells them in 2 kg bags at $5 per bag. First, I need to figure out how many bags he can make from 1000 kg.\n\nSo, if each bag is 2 kg, then the number of bags would be total kilograms divided by kilograms per bag. That is:\n\nNumber of bags = 1000 kg / 2 kg per bag = 500 bags.\n\nNow, each bag sells for $5, so the total revenue would be the number of bags multiplied by the price per bag.\n\nTotal revenue = 500 bags * $5 per bag = $2500.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything else I need to consider? Maybe packaging costs or something, but the question doesn't mention any additional costs. It just asks for the revenue from selling all his apples and the number of bags needed.\n\nSo, the farmer needs 500 bags to pack all his apples, and he will generate $2500 in revenue from selling them.\n\nI think that's it. Simple math, but sometimes these problems can have tricks, so I just want to double-check.\n\nYes, 1000 kg divided by 2 kg per bag is indeed 500 bags. And 500 bags at $5 each is $2500. That seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe farmer will generate $\\boxed{2500}$ dollars in revenue from selling all his apples, and he will need $\\boxed{500}$ bags."
