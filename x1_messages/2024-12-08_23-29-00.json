        "content": "Let's solve this step by step. The expression is (3^2 * 4) - (6 + 9) / 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the exponentiation, multiplication, addition, and division in the correct order, following the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the exponentiation:\n\n3^2 = 3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, the expression becomes (9 * 4) - (6 + 9) / 5.\n\nNext, I'll do the multiplication and addition inside the parentheses:\n\n9 * 4 = 36\n\n6 + 9 = 15\n\nSo now it's 36 - 15 / 5.\n\nNext, I need to do the division before the subtraction:\n\n15 / 5 = 3\n\nNow, the expression is 36 - 3.\n\nFinally, subtract 3 from 36:\n\n36 - 3 = 33\n\nSo, the final answer is 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]"
