        "content": "Alright, I need to figure out how nuclear fusion works and what its applications are. I have a bunch of tools at my disposal, like DuckDuckGo for searching, SummaryMaker to summarize long texts, URLExtractor to get links from text, SiteLoader to load website content, and KnowledgeBase to answer questions based on common knowledge or previous information.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by understanding what nuclear fusion is. I can use DuckDuckGo to search for \"how does nuclear fusion work\" to get some basic explanations. Maybe that will give me a good starting point.\n\nSo, I'll set:\n\nPlan: Search for an explanation of how nuclear fusion works.\n\n#E1 = DuckDuckGo[\"how does nuclear fusion work\"]\n\nOnce I have the search results in #E1, I can use URLExtractor to pull out the relevant links from those search results. Then, I can use SiteLoader to load the content from those links.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the search results.\n\n#E2 = URLExtractor[#E1]\n\nThen, load the content from those URLs.\n\nPlan: Load the content from the extracted URLs.\n\n#E3 = SiteLoader[#E2]\n\nNow, #E3 should contain the text content from those websites. Since these might be long and detailed, I can use SummaryMaker to condense the information into key points.\n\nPlan: Summarize the loaded content to understand how nuclear fusion works.\n\n#E4 = SummaryMaker[#E3]\n\nAfter summarizing, I should have a better grasp of the process. Now, I need to find out about the applications of nuclear fusion. I can either look for this information in the same sources or do another search.\n\nMaybe I can check if the summaries in #E4 already include information about applications. If not, I'll need to search separately.\n\nPlan: Check #E4 for information on applications of nuclear fusion.\n\nIf applications are not covered in #E4, then:\n\nPlan: Search for \"applications of nuclear fusion\".\n\n#E5 = DuckDuckGo[\"applications of nuclear fusion\"]\n\nThen, extract URLs from #E5.\n\nPlan: Extract URLs from the new search results.\n\n#E6 = URLExtractor[#E5]\n\nLoad the content from these URLs.\n\nPlan: Load the content from the extracted URLs.\n\n#E7 = SiteLoader[#E6]\n\nSummarize this content to get key points on applications.\n\nPlan: Summarize the loaded content to understand the applications of nuclear fusion.\n\n#E8 = SummaryMaker[#E7]\n\nFinally, I can use KnowledgeBase to compile all this information and provide a clear answer to the user's question.\n\nPlan: Use KnowledgeBase to answer the question based on all gathered evidence.\n\n#E9 = KnowledgeBase[\"How does nuclear fusion work and what are its applications?\", context: #E4 + #E8]\n\nThis should give me a comprehensive answer incorporating both how nuclear fusion works and its applications, based on the research I've done.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n#E9"
