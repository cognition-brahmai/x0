        "content": "So the friends ordered food that cost $150, and they want to give an 18% tip on that total bill. I need to find out how much the total amount they paid was, including the tip.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 18% of $150 is, and then add that to the original $150 to get the total amount paid.\n\nTo calculate 18% of $150, I can multiply 150 by 0.18, since percent means per hundred, so 18% is 18 per hundred, or 0.18 in decimal form.\n\nSo, 150 multiplied by 0.18:\n\n150 \u00d7 0.18 = 27\n\nSo, the tip is $27.\n\nNow, to find the total amount paid, I add the tip to the original bill:\n\n150 + 27 = 177\n\nTherefore, the total amount they paid, including the tip, is $177.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to calculate this? Maybe I can calculate the total amount paid directly by considering that they're paying 100% of the bill plus an 18% tip, which would be 118% of the original bill.\n\nSo, 118% of $150 would be:\n\n150 \u00d7 1.18 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n150 \u00d7 1.18 = 177\n\nYeah, same result. So, either way, the total amount paid is $177.\n\nI think that makes sense. It's good to know that both methods give the same answer, which confirms that $177 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{177} \\]"
