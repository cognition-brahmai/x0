        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have four friends: Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave, and together their ages add up to 100 years. We're given a few relationships between their ages, and we need to find out how old each one is.\n\nFirst, let's list out the information given:\n\n1. Alice is twice as old as Bob.\n\n2. Carol is 10 years younger than Alice.\n\n3. Dave is 5 years older than Bob.\n\n4. The sum of their ages is 100 years.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is by assigning variables to each person's age and then setting up equations based on the relationships provided.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Bob's age as B years.\n\n- Alice's age as A years.\n\n- Carol's age as C years.\n\n- Dave's age as D years.\n\nNow, let's translate the given relationships into equations:\n\n1. Alice is twice as old as Bob:\n\n   A = 2B\n\n2. Carol is 10 years younger than Alice:\n\n   C = A - 10\n\n3. Dave is 5 years older than Bob:\n\n   D = B + 5\n\n4. The combined age of all four friends is 100 years:\n\n   A + B + C + D = 100\n\nNow, we have a system of four equations with four variables. To solve this, I can substitute the expressions for A, C, and D from the first three equations into the fourth equation.\n\nLet's do that substitution:\n\n   A + B + C + D = 100\n\n   (2B) + B + (2B - 10) + (B + 5) = 100\n\nNow, let's simplify and combine like terms:\n\n   2B + B + 2B - 10 + B + 5 = 100\n\n   (2B + B + 2B + B) + (-10 + 5) = 100\n\n   6B - 5 = 100\n\nNow, let's solve for B:\n\n   6B - 5 = 100\n\n   6B = 100 + 5\n\n   6B = 105\n\n   B = 105 / 6\n\n   B = 17.5\n\nSo, Bob is 17.5 years old.\n\nNow, we can find the ages of the others using the relationships we established earlier.\n\nFirst, Alice's age:\n\n   A = 2B = 2 * 17.5 = 35 years\n\nNext, Carol's age:\n\n   C = A - 10 = 35 - 10 = 25 years\n\nThen, Dave's age:\n\n   D = B + 5 = 17.5 + 5 = 22.5 years\n\nFinally, let's check if the sum of their ages is indeed 100:\n\n   A + B + C + D = 35 + 17.5 + 25 + 22.5 = 100\n\n   Yes, it adds up correctly.\n\nSo, the ages are:\n\n- Alice: 35 years\n\n- Bob: 17.5 years\n\n- Carol: 25 years\n\n- Dave: 22.5 years\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Alice: } 35 \\text{ years}, \\text{ Bob: } 17.5 \\text{ years}, \\text{ Carol: } 25 \\text{ years}, \\text{ Dave: } 22.5 \\text{ years}} \\]"
