        "content": "Let's see. There are 120 cars on the lot, and they sell 15% of them in one week. I need to find out how many cars they have left after that.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cars were sold in that week. If they sold 15% of 120 cars, I can calculate that by multiplying 120 by 15%.\n\nBut I need to remember that percentages can be tricky sometimes. 15% is the same as 15 per 100, or 0.15 in decimal form. So, to find 15% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.15.\n\nLet me do that: 120 times 0.15.\n\n120 \u00d7 0.15.\n\nWell, 120 times 0.1 is 12, and 120 times 0.05 is 6. So, 12 plus 6 is 18.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 120 multiplied by 15, which is 1800, and then divide by 100, which also gives me 18.\n\nSo, they sold 18 cars in one week.\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are left, I need to subtract the number of cars sold from the original number of cars.\n\nThat is, 120 minus 18.\n\n120 - 18 equals 102.\n\nTherefore, they have 102 cars left on the lot after selling 15% of them in one week.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 15% of 120:\n\n120 \u00d7 0.15 = 18. That seems correct.\n\nThen, subtracting 18 from 120:\n\n120 - 18 = 102. That also seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of the percentage remaining.\n\nIf they sold 15%, that means they have 85% of the cars left.\n\nSo, 85% of 120 would be 120 multiplied by 0.85.\n\n120 \u00d7 0.85.\n\n120 times 0.8 is 96, and 120 times 0.05 is 6. So, 96 plus 6 is 102.\n\nAgain, that confirms that there are 102 cars left.\n\nAlternatively, I could use proportions.\n\nIf 100% is 120 cars, then 1% is 1.2 cars.\n\nSo, 15% would be 15 times 1.2, which is 18 cars sold.\n\nThen, 120 minus 18 is 102.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 102 cars left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{102} \\]"
