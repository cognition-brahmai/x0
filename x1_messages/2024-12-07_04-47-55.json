        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. We have 5 machines, each producing 8 widgets per hour. They work for 16 hours a day, and we need to find out how many widgets they produce together in 10 days.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate how many widgets one machine produces in one hour. That's given as 8 widgets.\n\nNext, since there are 5 machines, the total production per hour for all machines would be 5 times 8, which is 40 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, they work for 16 hours a day. So, the daily production would be 40 widgets per hour times 16 hours, which equals 640 widgets per day.\n\nFinally, to find out the production over 10 days, I'll multiply the daily production by 10: 640 widgets per day times 10 days equals 6,400 widgets.\n\nSo, the total production in 10 days is 6,400 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6400} \\]\n"
