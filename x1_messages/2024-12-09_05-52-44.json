        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Merge sort is a powerful sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It's efficient and works well on large datasets. I'll walk you through how to implement it in Python.\n\nFirst, let's understand the basic steps of merge sort:\n\n1. **Divide**: If the list has more than one element, divide it into two halves.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted list.\n\nThe key part is the merge step, where you combine two sorted lists into one sorted list. This is done by comparing the elements of the two lists and placing them in the correct order.\n\nNow, let's translate this into Python code. We'll write a function called `merge_sort` that takes a list of integers and returns a new list sorted in ascending order.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the list has zero or one element, it's already sorted, so we can return it as is.\n2. **Divide**: Find the midpoint of the list and split it into two sublists.\n3. **Conquer**: Recursively call `merge_sort` on each sublist.\n4. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted sublists back together.\n\nWe'll also need a helper function, say `merge`, to handle the merging of two sorted lists.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    # Base case: a list of zero or one elements is sorted\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    \n    # Divide: find the midpoint and split the list\n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half = arr[:mid]\n    right_half = arr[mid:]\n    \n    # Conquer: recursively sort both halves\n    left_sorted = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right_sorted = merge_sort(right_half)\n    \n    # Combine: merge the sorted halves\n    return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    # Initialize pointers for both lists\n    i = j = 0\n    merged = []\n    \n    # Merge the two lists by comparing elements\n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i] < right[j]:\n            merged.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in left or right, add them to the merged list\n    merged.extend(left[i:])\n    merged.extend(right[j:])\n    \n    return merged\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sample_list = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]\n    sorted_list = merge_sort(sample_list)\n    print(\"Original list:\", sample_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **merge_sort function**:\n   - Checks if the list is already sorted (base case).\n   - Splits the list into two halves.\n   - Recursively sorts each half.\n   - Merges the sorted halves using the `merge` function.\n\n2. **merge function**:\n   - Takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list.\n   - Uses pointers to traverse and compare elements of both lists.\n   - Adds any remaining elements from either list to the end of the merged list.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the list is sorted efficiently using the merge sort algorithm. The time complexity is O(n log n), making it suitable for large datasets.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
