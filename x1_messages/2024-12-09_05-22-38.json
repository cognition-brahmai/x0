        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got an election with 10,000 eligible voters, and 65% of them cast their ballots. First, I need to find out how many people actually voted.\n\nTo do that, I'll take 65% of 10,000. Percentages can be tricky, but I remember that \"percent\" means \"per hundred,\" so 65% is the same as 65 per 100 or 0.65 in decimal form.\n\nSo, number of voters = 10,000 \u00d7 0.65.\n\nLet me calculate that: 10,000 \u00d7 0.65 = 6,500 voters.\n\nAlright, so 6,500 people voted in total.\n\nNext, among these voters, 55% voted for candidate A, and the rest voted for candidate B. I need to find out how many votes each candidate received.\n\nFirst, for candidate A: 55% of 6,500.\n\nAgain, 55% is 0.55 in decimal form.\n\nSo, votes for candidate A = 6,500 \u00d7 0.55.\n\nLet's calculate that: 6,500 \u00d7 0.55.\n\nFirst, 6,500 \u00d7 0.5 = 3,250.\n\nThen, 6,500 \u00d7 0.05 = 325.\n\nSo, 3,250 + 325 = 3,575 votes for candidate A.\n\nNow, for candidate B, since the rest voted for them, it's 100% - 55% = 45% of the voters.\n\nSo, votes for candidate B = 6,500 \u00d7 0.45.\n\nLet's calculate that: 6,500 \u00d7 0.45.\n\nFirst, 6,500 \u00d7 0.4 = 2,600.\n\nThen, 6,500 \u00d7 0.05 = 325.\n\nSo, 2,600 + 325 = 2,925 votes for candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, just to double-check, let's see if the total votes add up to the total number of voters.\n\nVotes for A: 3,575\n\nVotes for B: 2,925\n\nTotal votes: 3,575 + 2,925 = 6,500, which matches the total number of voters. Great, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to sum it up, candidate A received 3,575 votes, and candidate B received 2,925 votes.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me just verify again.\n\nTotal eligible voters: 10,000\n\nPercentage who voted: 65%\n\nNumber of voters: 10,000 \u00d7 0.65 = 6,500\n\nPercentage for candidate A: 55%\n\nVotes for A: 6,500 \u00d7 0.55 = 3,575\n\nPercentage for candidate B: 45%\n\nVotes for B: 6,500 \u00d7 0.45 = 2,925\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of votes for candidate B by subtracting the votes for A from the total votes.\n\nSo, votes for B = total votes - votes for A = 6,500 - 3,575 = 2,925, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3575 \\text{ votes for candidate A and } 2925 \\text{ votes for candidate B}} \\]"
