        "content": "So I've got this problem here: \"In how many ways can you distribute 15 identical apples among 4 children such that each child gets at least one apple?\" Hmm, this sounds like a problem in combinatorics, specifically about distributing indistinguishable objects to distinct groups with certain constraints.\n\nFirst off, since the apples are identical, the order in which they are distributed doesn't matter. What's important is how many each child ends up with, not which specific apples they get. Also, each child has to get at least one apple, which is a crucial constraint.\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, there's a principle called the \"stars and bars\" theorem that's often used for distributing identical objects into distinct bins, especially when there are constraints like each bin getting at least one object.\n\nLet me refresh my memory on stars and bars. The general formula for distributing \\(n\\) identical items into \\(k\\) distinct bins, where each bin gets at least one item, is given by \\(\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nActually, I think the formula is \\(\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\) for distributing \\(n\\) identical items into \\(k\\) distinct bins with no restrictions on how many items each bin gets (except that each bin gets at least one). Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nBut in this problem, we have 15 apples and 4 children, and each child must get at least one apple. So, it seems directly applicable.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \\(n = 15\\) and \\(k = 4\\). So, the number of ways should be \\(\\binom{15-1}{4-1} = \\binom{14}{3}\\).\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(\\binom{14}{3}\\). I know that \\(\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\), so \\(\\binom{14}{3} = \\frac{14!}{3! \\cdot 11!}\\).\n\nCalculating factorials can be time-consuming, but since 14! and 11! have many common terms, they cancel out nicely. Specifically, \\(\\frac{14!}{11!} = 14 \\times 13 \\times 12\\), because 11! cancels out from the numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, \\(\\binom{14}{3} = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{3!} = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{6}\\).\n\nNow, calculating the numerator: 14 \u00d7 13 = 182, and 182 \u00d7 12 = 2184.\n\nThen, dividing by 6: 2184 \u00f7 6 = 364.\n\nTherefore, there are 364 ways to distribute 15 identical apples among 4 children, with each child getting at least one apple.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem to confirm that my answer is correct? Maybe using generating functions or inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet's try inclusion-exclusion. The total number of ways to distribute 15 identical apples to 4 children without any restrictions is \\(\\binom{15 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{18}{3}\\).\n\nBut, we need to subtract the cases where at least one child gets no apple. So, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal ways = \\(\\binom{18}{3}\\) - \\(\\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{15 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1}\\) + \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{15 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1}\\) - \\(\\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{15 + 1 - 1}{1 - 1}\\) + \\(\\binom{4}{4} \\times \\binom{15 + 0 - 1}{0 - 1}\\).\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I need to recall the inclusion-exclusion formula more carefully.\n\nActually, the inclusion-exclusion formula for distributing \\(n\\) identical items into \\(k\\) distinct bins, with each bin getting at least one item, is:\n\n\\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i \\times \\binom{k}{i} \\times \\binom{n - i - 1}{k - 1}\\).\n\nBut I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look up the exact formula for inclusion-exclusion in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that since each child must get at least one apple, I can first give each child one apple, and then distribute the remaining apples without any restrictions.\n\nThat seems like a simpler approach. So, if I give each of the 4 children one apple, I've given out 4 apples, leaving me with 15 - 4 = 11 apples to distribute freely among the 4 children, with no restrictions.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to distributing 11 identical apples to 4 children, where each child can get zero or more apples.\n\nUsing the stars and bars theorem again, the number of ways to do this is \\(\\binom{11 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{14}{3}\\).\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as before. So, this confirms that my initial answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways is indeed \\(\\binom{14}{3} = 364\\).\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem to ensure that I haven't missed something?\n\nPerhaps I can think about it in terms of integer solutions to an equation. If I let \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\) represent the number of apples each of the four children receives, then I need to find the number of positive integer solutions to the equation:\n\n\\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 15\\), where \\(x_i \\geq 1\\) for all \\(i\\).\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of positive integer solutions to that equation.\n\nI know that the number of positive integer solutions to \\(x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_k = n\\) is \\(\\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\\).\n\nAgain, plugging in \\(n = 15\\) and \\(k = 4\\), I get \\(\\binom{14}{3} = 364\\), which matches my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the transformation \\(y_i = x_i - 1\\), where \\(y_i \\geq 0\\), then the equation becomes:\n\n\\((y_1 + 1) + (y_2 + 1) + (y_3 + 1) + (y_4 + 1) = 15\\), which simplifies to \\(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 11\\), where \\(y_i \\geq 0\\).\n\nNow, this is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to \\(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 11\\), which is \\(\\binom{11 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{14}{3} = 364\\).\n\nYet another confirmation of the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the number of ways to distribute 15 identical apples among 4 children, with each child getting at least one apple, is 364.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{364} \\]"
