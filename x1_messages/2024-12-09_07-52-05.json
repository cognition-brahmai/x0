        "content": "So if a family uses on average 300 gallons of water per day, and we want to find out how much water they use in one year, we need to calculate the total water usage over 365 days, right? Because there are 365 days in a year.\n\nFirst, I'll take the daily usage, which is 300 gallons, and multiply it by the number of days in a year, which is 365. So, it's 300 gallons/day times 365 days.\n\nLet me do the math: 300 multiplied by 365.\n\nWell, 300 times 300 is 90,000, and 300 times 60 is 18,000, and 300 times 5 is 1,500. So, adding those up: 90,000 plus 18,000 is 108,000, and then plus 1,500 is 109,500.\n\nSo, the family uses 109,500 gallons of water in one year.\n\nBut wait, sometimes there are leap years with 366 days. Should I consider that?\n\nWell, the question didn't specify, so maybe I should mention that in leap years, the usage would be slightly higher.\n\nLet me calculate that too. If there are 366 days, then it's 300 gallons/day times 366 days.\n\nThat would be 300 times 366.\n\nWell, 300 times 300 is 90,000, 300 times 60 is 18,000, and 300 times 6 is 1,800.\n\nSo, 90,000 plus 18,000 is 108,000, plus 1,800 is 109,800 gallons.\n\nSo, in a leap year, the family would use 109,800 gallons.\n\nBut usually, when we talk about annual usage, we use 365 days, so 109,500 gallons is the standard answer.\n\nAlternatively, some people might use 365.25 to account for leap years over a four-year period.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf you take 365.25 days times 300 gallons/day, that would be 365.25 times 300.\n\nWell, 365 times 300 is 109,500, and 0.25 times 300 is 75.\n\nSo, 109,500 plus 75 is 109,575 gallons per year.\n\nBut I think that level of precision might be unnecessary for this question.\n\nSo, the straightforward answer is 109,500 gallons per year.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should note that this is for a non-leap year, and in a leap year, it would be 109,800 gallons.\n\nAlso, it's important to consider that water usage might not be exactly 300 gallons every day; there might be variations, but since the question says \"on average,\" we can proceed with that figure.\n\nAdditionally, if the family's water usage changes over the year due to seasonal factors or other reasons, the average might not accurately reflect the total annual usage.\n\nBut based on the information provided, using the average daily usage to calculate annual usage is the appropriate method.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the family uses approximately 109,500 gallons of water in one year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{109500} \\]"
