        "content": "Certainly! Newton's method is an iterative approach to finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. For finding the square root of a number, say \\( n \\), we can consider it as finding the root of the function \\( f(x) = x^2 - n \\). The iterative formula for Newton's method in this case is:\n\n\\[ x_{k+1} = \\frac{x_k + \\frac{n}{x_k}}{2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( x_k \\) is the k-th approximation.\n\nHere's a simple Python function that implements Newton's method to find the square root of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef sqrt_newton(n, tolerance=1e-10, max_iterations=1000):\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot compute square root of a negative number.\")\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Initial guess can be any positive number; n/2 is a common choice\n    x = n / 2.0\n    \n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        next_x = (x + n / x) / 2\n        if abs(next_x - x) < tolerance:\n            return next_x\n        x = next_x\n    \n    # If convergence hasn't happened within max_iterations, return the current approximation\n    return x\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 25\nresult = sqrt_newton(number)\nprint(f\"The square root of {number} is approximately {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initial Guess**: We start with an initial guess for the square root. Here, we use \\( n/2 \\), but other choices like \\( n \\) itself or 1 can also be used.\n2. **Iteration**: We iteratively improve the guess using the formula above until the difference between successive approximations is less than a predefined tolerance level.\n3. **Convergence Check**: We check if the absolute difference between the current and next approximation is less than the tolerance. If it is, we consider the approximation accurate enough and return it.\n4. **Maximum Iterations**: To prevent infinite loops, we set a maximum number of iterations. If the method doesn't converge within these iterations, we return the current approximation.\n\nThis method is efficient and converges quickly to the accurate value, making it a preferred choice for computing square roots."
