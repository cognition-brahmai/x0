The game should have at least three character classes (e.g., warrior, mage, rogue), each with unique abilities, and a simple inventory system for managing items. Implement a basic combat system where the player can engage in battles with randomly generated enemies."

        "content": "Creating a full-fledged text-based RPG game in C++ is a complex task that involves multiple components such as character classes, items, inventory management, and combat systems. Below, I'll provide a simplified version of such a game, focusing on the key aspects you've mentioned.\n\n### Game Overview\n\n- **Character Classes**: Warrior, Mage, Rogue\n- **Unique Abilities**:\n  - Warrior: High health and strength, ability to shield bash.\n  - Mage: Low health, high magic damage, ability to cast fireball.\n  - Rogue: Moderate health and agility, ability to backstab.\n- **Inventory System**: Basic item management.\n- **Combat System**: Turn-based combat with player and enemy actions.\n\n### Code Structure\n\nThe game will consist of several classes:\n\n1. **Character Class**: Base class for all characters.\n2. **Warrior, Mage, Rogue**: Derived classes from Character with unique abilities.\n3. **Item Class**: Represents items in the inventory.\n4. **Inventory Class**: Manages items.\n5. **Game Class**: Orchestrates the game flow, including character creation, combat, and interactions.\n\n### Source Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n\nclass Item {\npublic:\n    std::string name;\n    int value;\n\n    Item(std::string n, int v) : name(n), value(v) {}\n};\n\nclass Inventory {\nprivate:\n    std::vector<Item> items;\n\npublic:\n    void add(Item item) {\n        items.push_back(item);\n    }\n\n    void display() {\n        std::cout << \"Inventory:\\n\";\n        for (size_t i = 0; i < items.size(); ++i) {\n            std::cout << i + 1 << \". \" << items[i].name << \" - Value: \" << items[i].value << \"\\n\";\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nclass Character {\nprotected:\n    std::string name;\n    int health;\n    int strength;\n    int magic;\n    int agility;\n\npublic:\n    Character(std::string n, int h, int s, int m, int a)\n        : name(n), health(h), strength(s), magic(m), agility(a) {}\n\n    virtual void attack(Character& enemy) = 0;\n\n    bool isAlive() {\n        return health > 0;\n    }\n\n    void takeDamage(int damage) {\n        health -= damage;\n        if (health < 0) health = 0;\n    }\n\n    std::string getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    int getHealth() {\n        return health;\n    }\n};\n\nclass Warrior : public Character {\npublic:\n    Warrior(std::string n) : Character(n, 150, 20, 5, 10) {}\n\n    void attack(Character& enemy) override {\n        int damage = strength + (rand() % 10);\n        enemy.takeDamage(damage);\n        std::cout << \"Warrior attacks \" << enemy.getName() << \" for \" << damage << \" damage.\\n\";\n    }\n};\n\nclass Mage : public Character {\npublic:\n    Mage(std::string n) : Character(n, 100, 10, 20, 15) {}\n\n    void attack(Character& enemy) override {\n        int damage = magic + (rand() % 15);\n        enemy.takeDamage(damage);\n        std::cout << \"Mage casts fireball on \" << enemy.getName() << \" for \" << damage << \" damage.\\n\";\n    }\n};\n\nclass Rogue : public Character {\npublic:\n    Rogue(std::string n) : Character(n, 120, 15, 10, 20) {}\n\n    void attack(Character& enemy) override {\n        int damage = agility + (rand() % 12);\n        enemy.takeDamage(damage);\n        std::cout << \"Rogue backstabs \" << enemy.getName() << \" for \" << damage << \" damage.\\n\";\n    }\n};\n\nclass Game {\nprivate:\n    Character* player;\n    Character* enemy;\n\npublic:\n    Game() {\n        srand(time(0));\n    }\n\n    void createCharacter() {\n        std::string name;\n        int choice;\n\n        std::cout << \"Enter your character's name: \";\n        std::cin >> name;\n\n        std::cout << \"Choose your character class:\\n\";\n        std::cout << \"1.
