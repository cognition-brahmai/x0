        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are 4 houses in a row, and I need to figure out their order based on some clues.\n\nFirst clue: The green house is immediately to the left of the white house. So, green and white are next to each other, with green on the left.\n\nSecond clue: The red house is the first one on the left. So, the leftmost house is red.\n\nThird clue: The blue house is not next to the green house.\n\nAlright, let's start by placing the red house since we know it's first on the left. So, the order starts with red.\n\nHouse 1: Red\n\nNow, the green house is immediately to the left of the white house, but since red is already on the leftmost position, green can't be there. So, green has to be in house 2, 3, or 4, but it always has to have the white house immediately to its right.\n\nAlso, blue is not next to green.\n\nLet me try placing green and white together.\n\nOption 1: Houses 2 and 3 are green and white respectively.\n\nSo, House 1: Red\n\nHouse 2: Green\n\nHouse 3: White\n\nNow, House 4 can be blue, but we need to check if blue is next to green. House 2 is green, House 3 is white, so green and blue are not next to each other. This seems okay.\n\nOption 2: Houses 3 and 4 are green and white respectively.\n\nSo, House 1: Red\n\nHouse 2: Blue\n\nHouse 3: Green\n\nHouse 4: White\n\nHere, green and white are next to each other with green to the left, which satisfies the first clue. Also, blue is not next to green because blue is in house 2, and green is in house 3. So, this also works.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, is there any other constraints I'm missing?\n\nLet me see: The red house is first on the left, which is satisfied in both options. Green is immediately to the left of white, which is satisfied in both options. Blue is not next to green, which is also satisfied in both options.\n\nSo, both options seem possible based on the given clues.\n\nOption 1: Red, Green, White, Blue\n\nOption 2: Red, Blue, Green, White\n\nIs there any other clue that can help me decide between these two options?\n\nWait, in option 1, green is in house 2, and white is in house 3. Blue is in house 4, not next to green. That's fine.\n\nIn option 2, green is in house 3, white in house 4, blue in house 2, not next to green. Also fine.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nLet me try to see if there are any other possibilities.\n\nOption 3: Red, White, Green, Blue\n\nBut in this case, green is immediately to the left of white, which would require green to be in house 3 and white in house 4. But in this option, white is in house 2 and green in house 3, which doesn't satisfy the first clue. So, this is invalid.\n\nOption 4: Red, Blue, White, Green\n\nHere, green is in house 4, and white is in house 3, which would mean green is immediately to the left of white. Wait, no, green is to the left of white, but in this option, green is to the right of white. So, this doesn't satisfy the first clue.\n\nOption 5: Red, Green, Blue, White\n\nHere, green is in house 2, white in house 4. But green should be immediately to the left of white, which isn't the case here. Green is in house 2, white is in house 4, with blue in between. So, this doesn't satisfy the first clue.\n\nOption 6: Red, White, Blue, Green\n\nGreen is in house 4, white is in house 2. Again, green is not immediately to the left of white.\n\nSo, only options 1 and 2 are valid based on the clues provided.\n\nNow, is there any way to determine which one is the correct order?\n\nLet me check the clues again.\n\nFirst clue: Green is immediately to the left of white.\n\nSecond clue: Red is first on the left.\n\nThird clue: Blue is not next to green.\n\nIn both options 1 and 2, these clues are satisfied.\n\nIs there any other implicit information I can use?\n\nWait, perhaps the fact that the houses are in a row and there are only four houses means that the positions are fixed, and based on the clues, both options are possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the positions more carefully.\n\nHouse 1: Red (given)\n\nHouse 2: ?\n\nHouse 3: ?\n\nHouse 4: ?\n\nClue 1: Green is immediately to the left of white.\n\nClue 3: Blue is not next to green.\n\nIn option 1: Red, Green, White, Blue\n\nHere, green is in house 2, white in house 3, blue in house 4. Green and blue are not next to each other.\n\nIn option 2: Red, Blue, Green, White\n\nHere, green is in house 3, white in house 4, blue in house 2. Again, green and blue are not next to each other.\n\nSo, both arrangements satisfy all the given clues.\n\nMaybe the problem allows for multiple solutions, or perhaps there's an additional clue I haven't considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem implies that the houses are in a specific order and only one arrangement is possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the green and white houses are a pair, and place them accordingly.\n\nGiven that, and with red fixed in house 1, the only variables are the positions of green, white, and blue, with the constraints provided.\n\nSince both options satisfy the constraints, perhaps both are valid solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution and I need to find it.\n\nLet me try to see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose red is in house 1.\n\nThen, green and white have to be in positions where green is immediately to the left of white.\n\nSo, possible pairs for green and white are:\n\n- House 2 and 3\n\n- House 3 and 4\n\nIn both cases, blue would take the remaining house, and as long as blue is not next to green, it's okay.\n\nIn the first case: Red, Green, White, Blue\n\nHere, green is in house 2, white in 3, blue in 4. Blue is not next to green (blue is in house 4, green in house 2).\n\nIn the second case: Red, Blue, Green, White\n\nHere, green is in house 3, white in 4, blue in 2. Again, blue is not next to green.\n\nSo, both arrangements work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a single answer, and I need to find a way to determine which one is correct.\n\nMaybe there's an implicit assumption or another clue I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be solved with the minimal assumptions, and hence both options are possible.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects a single answer, and I need to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other possible arrangements.\n\nSuppose red is in house 1, green is in house 3, white is in house 4, and blue is in house 2.\n\nThat's option 2: Red, Blue, Green, White.\n\nAlternatively, red in house 1, green in house 2, white in house 3, blue in house 4.\n\nThat's option 1: Red, Green, White, Blue.\n\nAre there any other possible arrangements that satisfy all the clues?\n\nIf I try red in house 1, green in house 4, but then white would have to be in house 5, which doesn't exist. So, that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, only the two options are possible.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem allows for both arrangements, or perhaps there's additional information I can use to determine which one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to be solved with the assumption that there is only one possible arrangement, and hence I need to find a way to eliminate one of the options.\n\nBut in both options, all clues are satisfied, so I don't see a way to eliminate either one.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that there are two possible arrangements:\n\n1. Red, Green, White, Blue\n\n2. Red, Blue, Green, White\n\nUnless there's another clue or constraint provided that I haven't considered, both arrangements seem valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Red, Green, White, Blue} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Red, Blue, Green, White}} \\]"
