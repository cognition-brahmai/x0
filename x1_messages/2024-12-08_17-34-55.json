        "content": "So I need to compute the homology groups H_n(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) for all n greater than or equal to 0, where S^1 is the circle. Okay, let's start by understanding what S^1 \u00d7 S^1 is. This is the product of two circles, which is essentially a torus. So, I'm supposed to find the homology groups of a torus.\n\nI recall that homology groups are algebraic invariants that help us understand the holes in a topological space. For a torus, I know it has one hole in the middle and one hole through the handle, but I need to be more precise.\n\nFirst, I should recall the definition of singular homology. For a topological space X, the n-th homology group H_n(X) is the quotient of the group of n-cycles by the group of n-boundaries. To compute these, I can use the simplicial homology approach if I have a triangulation of the space, or I can use other tools like Mayer-Vietoris sequences if the space can be decomposed into simpler parts.\n\nSince S^1 \u00d7 S^1 is a product space, maybe there's a way to use the K\u00fcnneth formula to compute its homology groups in terms of the homology groups of S^1.\n\nLet me recall the K\u00fcnneth formula. For two topological spaces X and Y that are sufficiently nice (like CW complexes), the K\u00fcnneth formula says that:\n\nH_n(X \u00d7 Y) \u2245 \u2295_{p+q=n} H_p(X) \u2297 H_q(Y) \u2295 \u2295_{p+q=n-1} Tor(H_p(X), H_q(Y))\n\nwhere Tor is the torsion product.\n\nSo, if I can compute the homology groups of S^1, I can plug them into this formula to get the homology groups of S^1 \u00d7 S^1.\n\nI know that the homology groups of S^1 are:\n\nH_0(S^1) = Z (since it's connected)\n\nH_1(S^1) = Z (since it has one hole)\n\nH_n(S^1) = 0 for n \u2265 2 (since it's a 1-dimensional manifold)\n\nSo, applying the K\u00fcnneth formula for X = S^1 and Y = S^1, I get:\n\nH_n(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) \u2245 \u2295_{p+q=n} H_p(S^1) \u2297 H_q(S^1) \u2295 \u2295_{p+q=n-1} Tor(H_p(S^1), H_q(S^1))\n\nLet's compute this for each n.\n\nFirst, for n = 0:\n\nH_0(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) \u2245 H_0(S^1) \u2297 H_0(S^1) \u2295 Tor(H_{-1}(S^1), H_0(S^1)) \u2295 Tor(H_0(S^1), H_{-1}(S^1))\n\nBut homology groups below dimension 0 are zero, so the Tor terms vanish.\n\nH_0(S^1) = Z and H_0(S^1) = Z, so Z \u2297 Z = Z.\n\nTherefore, H_0(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) = Z.\n\nThis makes sense because the torus is connected.\n\nNext, for n = 1:\n\nH_1(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) \u2245 H_0(S^1) \u2297 H_1(S^1) \u2295 H_1(S^1) \u2297 H_0(S^1) \u2295 Tor(H_{0}(S^1), H_{0}(S^1))\n\nH_0(S^1) = Z, H_1(S^1) = Z.\n\nSo, Z \u2297 Z = Z, and Z \u2297 Z = Z again.\n\nTor(Z, Z) = 0 because Z is free.\n\nTherefore, H_1(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) = Z \u2295 Z.\n\nThis suggests that the first homology group is Z^2, which matches the intuition that the torus has two independent loops: one going around the hole in the middle and one going around the handle.\n\nNow, for n = 2:\n\nH_2(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) \u2245 H_2(S^1) \u2297 H_0(S^1) \u2295 H_1(S^1) \u2297 H_1(S^1) \u2295 H_0(S^1) \u2297 H_2(S^1) \u2295 Tor(H_1(S^1), H_0(S^1)) \u2295 Tor(H_0(S^1), H_1(S^1))\n\nBut H_2(S^1) = 0, so the first, second, and third terms vanish.\n\nTor(Z, Z) = 0 and Tor(Z, Z) = 0 again.\n\nSo, H_2(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) \u2245 Z \u2297 Z = Z.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, all the direct sum terms vanish, and the Tor terms are Tor(Z, Z) and Tor(Z, Z), both zero.\n\nSo, H_2(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) = 0.\n\nBut this can't be right because I know that the torus has a 2-dimensional hole.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in applying the K\u00fcnneth formula.\n\nLet me check the formula again.\n\nI think I might have misapplied it. Let me look up the K\u00fcnneth formula more carefully.\n\nUpon checking, I see that the K\u00fcnneth formula for two spaces X and Y is:\n\nH_n(X \u00d7 Y) \u2245 \u2295_{p+q=n} H_p(X) \u2297 H_q(Y) \u2295 \u2295_{p+q=n-1} Tor(H_p(X), H_q(Y))\n\nSo, for n=2, it should be:\n\nH_2(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) \u2245 (H_2(S^1) \u2297 H_0(S^1)) \u2295 (H_1(S^1) \u2297 H_1(S^1)) \u2295 (H_0(S^1) \u2297 H_2(S^1)) \u2295 Tor(H_1(S^1), H_0(S^1)) \u2295 Tor(H_0(S^1), H_1(S^1))\n\nAs before, H_2(S^1) = 0 and H_2(S^1) = 0, so the first and third terms are zero.\n\nH_1(S^1) = Z and H_1(S^1) = Z, so Z \u2297 Z = Z.\n\nTor(Z, Z) = 0 and Tor(Z, Z) = 0.\n\nTherefore, H_2(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) \u2245 Z.\n\nAh, I see. I must have misread my earlier calculation. So, H_2(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) = Z.\n\nThis makes sense because the torus has a 2-dimensional hole.\n\nNow, for n \u2265 3:\n\nH_n(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) \u2245 \u2295_{p+q=n} H_p(S^1) \u2297 H_q(S^1) \u2295 \u2295_{p+q=n-1} Tor(H_p(S^1), H_q(S^1))\n\nSince H_k(S^1) = 0 for k \u2265 2, all the terms H_p(S^1) and H_q(S^1) for p or q \u2265 2 are zero.\n\nTherefore, all the tensor products and Tor products are zero for n \u2265 3.\n\nThus, H_n(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) = 0 for n \u2265 3.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nH_0(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) = Z\n\nH_1(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) = Z \u2295 Z\n\nH_2(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) = Z\n\nH_n(S^1 \u00d7 S^1) = 0 for n \u2265 3\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the torus as a square with opposite sides identified, which is a common way to represent it.\n\nUsing this representation, we can compute its homology groups via simplicial homology.\n\nLet me try that as a cross-check.\n\nSo, consider the square with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, say A(0,0), B(1,0), C(1,1), D(0,1).\n\nIdentify AB with DC and AD with BC.\n\nThis gives us the torus.\n\nNow, let's triangulate this square.\n\nFor simplicity, divide the square into two triangles by drawing the diagonal from A to C.\n\nSo, we have triangles ABC and ADC.\n\nNow, under the identification, point A is identified with point C, and point B is identified with point D.\n\nWait, actually, since AB is identified with DC and AD with BC, let's see:\n\nAB is identified with DC, meaning A is identified with D and B with C.\n\nSimilarly, AD is identified with BC, meaning A with B and D with C.\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent.\n\nActually, in the standard torus construction, identifying AB with DC and AD with BC, all four vertices coincide in the quotient space.\n\nSo, in the quotient, there is only one vertex.\n\nLet's denote this single vertex as V.\n\nNow, the edges:\n\n- AB and DC are identified, so let's call this edge A.\n\n- AD and BC are identified, so let's call this edge B.\n\n- The diagonal AC is identified with itself, but since A and C are identified to V, this diagonal becomes a loop from V to V.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be more careful.\n\nLet me try to assign orientations.\n\nLet's orient AB from A to B, and DC from D to C.\n\nSince AB is identified with DC, and under the identification D maps to A and C to B, the orientation is preserved.\n\nSimilarly, orient AD from A to D, and BC from B to C.\n\nUnder identification, AD is identified with BC, with A to B and D to C, so again the orientation is preserved.\n\nNow, in the quotient space, we have two edges A and B meeting at the single vertex V.\n\nThe triangles ABC and ADC become 2-simplices with boundaries:\n\n- ABC: A - B - C - A\n\n- ADC: A - D - C - A\n\nBut since A is identified with D and B with C, these boundaries simplify in the quotient.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the cellular homology approach.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nIn cellular homology, we consider the CW complex structure of the torus.\n\nThe torus can be given a CW structure with:\n\n- One 0-cell (vertex)\n\n- Two 1-cells (edges)\n\n- One 2-cell (face)\n\nLet's denote the 0-cell as V.\n\nThe two 1-cells as A and B.\n\nThe 2-cell as U.\n\nWe need to attach the 2-cell U to the 1-skeleton via the attaching map.\n\nThe attaching map for the torus is the commutator loop [A, B] = ABA^{-1}B^{-1}.\n\nSo, the cellular chain complex is:\n\nC_2 = Z U\n\nC_1 = Z A \u2295 Z B\n\nC_0 = Z V\n\nWith boundary maps:\n\nd_2(U) = A + B - A - B = 0\n\nd_1(A) = V - V = 0\n\nd_1(B) = V - V = 0\n\nWait, that seems off.\n\nActually, in cellular homology, the boundary of a 2-cell attached via the loop [A, B] is indeed A + B - A - B, but in the cellular boundary formula, it's more precise.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the formula for the boundary of a cellular chain.\n\nIn cellular homology, the boundary of a k-cell maps into the (k-1)-skeleton.\n\nFor the torus, with the attaching map of U being ABA^{-1}B^{-1}, the boundary d_2(U) is the sum of the 1-cells with coefficients according to the degrees of the attaching map.\n\nBut in this case, since A and B are attached in a commutator, the net boundary should be zero.\n\nWait, actually, in the cellular boundary formula, d_2(U) is the sum over the 1-cells e^1_\u03b1 the degree of the map from the boundary of U corresponding to e^1_\u03b1.\n\nIn this case, the attaching map is ABA^{-1}B^{-1}, so:\n\n- The degree for A is +1\n\n- The degree for B is +1\n\n- The degree for A^{-1} is -1\n\n- The degree for B^{-1} is -1\n\nSo, d_2(U) = A + B - A - B = 0\n\nSimilarly, d_1(A) = V - V = 0\n\nd_1(B) = V - V = 0\n\nTherefore, the homology groups are:\n\nH_2 = C_2 / d_3(C_3) = Z / 0 = Z (since C_3 = 0)\n\nH_1 = ker d_1 / im d_2 = C_1 / 0 = Z A \u2295 Z B\n\nH_0 = ker d_0 / im d_1 = C_0 / 0 = Z V\n\nThis matches what I got from the K\u00fcnneth formula.\n\nSo, H_0 = Z, H_1 = Z \u2295 Z, H_2 = Z, and H_n = 0 for n \u2265 3.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the fact that the torus is a surface of genus 1, and for surfaces of genus g, the homology groups are known:\n\nH_0 = Z\n\nH_1 = Z^{2g}\n\nH_2 = Z\n\nWhich again confirms the result for g=1.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the fact that S^1 \u00d7 S^1 is a CW complex with the above cellular structure and computed its homology accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, by considering the torus as the union of two open sets that are both homeomorphic to S^1 \u00d7 (-1,1), with intersection S^1 \u00d7 (-1,1) \u222a S^1 \u00d7 (-1,1), which is homotopy equivalent to S^1 \u2228 S^1.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated than necessary.\n\nIn any case, all these methods lead to the same result.\n\nSo, to summarize, the homology groups of S^1 \u00d7 S^1 are:\n\nH_0 = Z\n\nH_1 = Z \u2295 Z\n\nH_2 = Z\n\nH_n = 0 for n \u2265 3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ H_0(S^1 \\times S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad H_1(S^1 \\times S^1) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad H_2(S^1 \\times S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad H_n(S^1 \\times S^1) = 0 \\text{ for } n \\geq 3 } \\]"
