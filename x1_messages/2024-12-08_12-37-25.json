        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are three types of cookies: chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and sugar. The bakery has some ratios for how many of each type they sell.\n\nFirst, it says that for every 4 chocolate chip cookies sold, 2 oatmeal raisin cookies are sold. That means the ratio of chocolate chip to oatmeal raisin is 4:2, which simplifies to 2:1. So, for every 2 chocolate chip cookies, there's 1 oatmeal raisin cookie.\n\nThen, for every 2 oatmeal raisin cookies sold, 1 sugar cookie is sold. So, the ratio of oatmeal raisin to sugar is 2:1.\n\nNow, I need to combine these ratios to find out how many of each type were sold in total of 28 cookies.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let C be the number of chocolate chip cookies.\n\n- Let O be the number of oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\n- Let S be the number of sugar cookies.\n\nFrom the first ratio, C:O = 2:1, which means C = 2O.\n\nFrom the second ratio, O:S = 2:1, which means O = 2S.\n\nSo, if O = 2S, and C = 2O, then C = 2*(2S) = 4S.\n\nNow, the total number of cookies is C + O + S = 28.\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of S:\n\n4S + 2S + S = 28.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n7S = 28.\n\nSo, S = 28 / 7 = 4.\n\nNow, O = 2S = 2*4 = 8.\n\nAnd C = 4S = 4*4 = 16.\n\nLet me check if this adds up:\n\n16 (chocolate chip) + 8 (oatmeal raisin) + 4 (sugar) = 28. Yes, that matches.\n\nAlso, let's check the ratios:\n\nC:O = 16:8 = 2:1, which matches the first ratio.\n\nO:S = 8:4 = 2:1, which matches the second ratio.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16 \\text{ chocolate chip},\\ 8 \\text{ oatmeal raisin},\\ 4 \\text{ sugar cookies}} \\]"
