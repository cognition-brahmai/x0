Basic chemistry introduces fundamental concepts like atomic structure, chemical bonding, and the periodic table. Organic chemistry focuses on the study of carbon-containing compounds, including hydrocarbons and their derivatives. Physical chemistry combines principles of physics and chemistry to understand the physical properties of molecules and the forces that act upon them. Which of these branches of chemistry is primarily concerned with the study of carbon-containing compounds?\nA. Basic Chemistry\nB. Inorganic Chemistry\nC. Physical Chemistry\nD.

Organic Chemistry\n\nOrganic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that specifically deals with the study of carbon-containing compounds, their properties, reactions, and synthesis. It focuses on hydrocarbons and their derivatives, which are molecules that contain carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen and other elements like oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and halogens. This field is crucial in understanding the chemistry of life, as most biological molecules are organic compounds.\n"
