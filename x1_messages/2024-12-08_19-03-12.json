        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a rectangular field that's 150 meters long and 90 meters wide. I need to figure out how far I'll walk if I go around the perimeter of the field three times. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the perimeter of a rectangle is. The perimeter is the total distance around the edge of the shape. For a rectangle, you have two lengths and two widths, so the formula for the perimeter should be something like this:\n\nPerimeter (P) = 2 * length (L) + 2 * width (W)\n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 150 meters, and the width (W) is 90 meters. So plugging in those values:\n\nP = 2 * 150 + 2 * 90\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2 * 150 = 300 meters\n\n2 * 90 = 180 meters\n\nSo, P = 300 + 180 = 480 meters\n\nThat means one complete walk around the field is 480 meters.\n\nBut the question says I walk around the perimeter three times. So, to find the total distance covered, I need to multiply the perimeter by 3:\n\nTotal distance = P * 3 = 480 meters * 3\n\nLet's do that multiplication:\n\n480 * 3 = 1440 meters\n\nSo, I would cover 1440 meters in total.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I could think about the total distance in terms of the individual lengths and widths. If I walk around the field three times, I'm covering three times the length and width each.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Each time around, I cover two lengths and two widths. So in three laps, I'd cover:\n\nTotal length covered = 3 * 2 * L = 6 * L\n\nTotal width covered = 3 * 2 * W = 6 * W\n\nSo total distance would be 6 * L + 6 * W = 6 * (L + W)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n6 * (150 + 90) = 6 * 240 = 1440 meters\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, since the perimeter is 480 meters, multiplying by 3 directly gives the same result.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using the concept of circumference, but that's for circles, not rectangles. Or perhaps using area, but that wouldn't make sense because area is in square meters, and we're dealing with distance.\n\nNo, perimeter seems to be the correct approach here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check the units. The length and width are in meters, so the perimeter will be in meters, and multiplying by 3 keeps the units in meters. So, 1440 meters seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer: 1440 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1440} \\]"
