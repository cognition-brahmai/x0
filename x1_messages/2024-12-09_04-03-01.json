        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. First, we have a class of 30 students, and 60% of them are female. So, to find out how many females there are, we can calculate 60% of 30.\n\nNumber of females = 60% of 30 = 0.6 * 30 = 18 females.\n\nNow, since the total number of students is 30, and there are 18 females, the number of males would be:\n\nNumber of males = Total students - Number of females = 30 - 18 = 12 males.\n\nNext, we're told that 75% of the females pass the exam. So, to find out how many females passed:\n\nNumber of females who passed = 75% of 18 = 0.75 * 18 = 13.5.\n\nWait, but we can't have half a student, so maybe there's a mistake here. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nActually, 75% of 18 is indeed 13.5, but since we're dealing with people, it's unusual to have a half person. Maybe the numbers are supposed to work out to whole numbers. Perhaps I should check the percentages again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to round to the nearest whole number. So, 13.5 would round to 14 females passed.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps I should keep it as 13.5 for now and see what happens.\n\nMoving on, 80% of the males pass the exam. So, number of males who passed:\n\nNumber of males who passed = 80% of 12 = 0.8 * 12 = 9.6.\n\nAgain, we have a fraction of a person. Maybe the problem allows for that, or maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nTotal number of students who passed = Number of females who passed + Number of males who passed = 13.5 + 9.6 = 23.1.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of the entire class that passed, I'll divide the total number who passed by the total number of students, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nPercentage passed = (Number passed / Total students) * 100 = (23.1 / 30) * 100.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 23.1 divided by 30 is 0.77.\n\nThen, 0.77 multiplied by 100 is 77%.\n\nSo, approximately 77% of the entire class passed the exam.\n\nBut considering the earlier issue with half persons, maybe the problem expects us to round or handle fractions differently. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using proportions.\n\nTotal females: 18\n\nFemales who passed: 75% of 18 = 13.5\n\nTotal males: 12\n\nMales who passed: 80% of 12 = 9.6\n\nTotal passed: 13.5 + 9.6 = 23.1\n\nTotal students: 30\n\nPercentage passed: (23.1 / 30) * 100 = 77%\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of percentages directly.\n\nSince 60% of the class are females, and 75% of them pass, the contribution of females to the total pass rate is 60% * 75% = 45%.\n\nSimilarly, males are 40% of the class (100% - 60%), and 80% of them pass, so their contribution is 40% * 80% = 32%.\n\nTotal pass rate = females' contribution + males' contribution = 45% + 32% = 77%.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the entire class that passed the exam is 77%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{77\\%} \\]"
