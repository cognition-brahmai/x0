        "content": "To create a Python script that interacts with a Memcached server as per your requirements, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install the required package**: We'll use the `pymemcache` library to interact with the Memcached server.\n\n2. **Connect to the Memcached server**: Assuming the server is running locally on the default port.\n\n3. **Store key-value pairs**: Insert data into the cache.\n\n4. **Retrieve values by keys**: Fetch data from the cache using keys.\n\n5. **Delete entries based on a condition**: Remove entries where the value is greater than 100.\n\n### Step 1: Install the required package\n\nFirst, make sure you have `pymemcache` installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pymemcache\n```\n\n### Step 2: Connect to the Memcached server\n\nWe'll connect to a Memcached server running locally on the default port (11211).\n\n### Step 3: Store key-value pairs\n\nWe'll store some sample key-value pairs in the cache.\n\n### Step 4: Retrieve values by keys\n\nWe'll retrieve values using their keys to verify that they are stored correctly.\n\n### Step 5: Delete entries based on a condition\n\nWe'll delete entries where the value is greater than 100.\n\nHere's the complete Python script that accomplishes these tasks:\n\n```python\nfrom pymemcache.client.base import Client\n\n# Connect to the local Memcached server\nclient = Client(('127.0.0.1', 11211))\n\n# Function to store key-value pairs\ndef store_data(data):\n    for key, value in data.items():\n        client.set(key, value)\n    print(\"Data stored successfully.\")\n\n# Function to retrieve values by keys\ndef get_values(keys):\n    for key in keys:\n        value = client.get(key)\n        if value is not None:\n            print(f\"Key: {key}, Value: {value}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Key: {key} not found.\")\n\n# Function to delete entries where value > 100\ndef delete_entries_above_100():\n    # Fetch all keys\n    keys = client.stats('items')\n    for key in keys:\n        value = client.get(key)\n        if value is not None and value > 100:\n            client.delete(key)\n            print(f\"Deleted key: {key} with value: {value}\")\n\n# Sample data to store\nsample_data = {\n    'key1': 50,\n    'key2': 150,\n    'key3': 200,\n    'key4': 75\n}\n\n# Store the sample data\nstore_data(sample_data)\n\n# Retrieve values for specific keys\nkeys_to_fetch = ['key1', 'key2', 'key3', 'key4']\nget_values(keys_to_fetch)\n\n# Delete entries where value > 100\ndelete_entries_above_100()\n\n# Retrieve again to verify deletion\nget_values(keys_to_fetch)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Connecting to Memcached**: We use `pymemcache.client.base.Client` to connect to the Memcached server running on localhost at port 11211.\n\n2. **Storing Data**: The `store_data` function takes a dictionary of key-value pairs and stores them in the Memcached server using `client.set()`.\n\n3. **Retrieving Data**: The `get_values` function takes a list of keys and retrieves their corresponding values using `client.get()`, printing the results.\n\n4. **Deleting Entries**: The `delete_entries_above_100` function fetches all keys from the server using `client.stats('items')`, checks their values, and deletes those with values greater than 100 using `client.delete()`.\n\n5. **Sample Data Operations**: We store sample data, retrieve it, delete entries based on the condition, and retrieve again to verify the deletions.\n\nMake sure your Memcached server is running before executing this script. You can start Memcached using:\n\n```bash\nmemcached -d\n```\n\nThis script provides a basic framework for interacting with Memcached using Python, covering storage, retrieval, and conditional deletion of entries."
