        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a plane flying at an average speed of 550 miles per hour for a duration of 8 hours and 30 minutes. We need to find out how far it travels, which means we're looking for the distance.\n\nI remember that distance, speed, and time are related by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, if we plug in the values we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 550 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 8.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nWait, 8 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 8.5 hours, right? Because 30 minutes is half an hour, so 8 plus 0.5 equals 8.5 hours.\n\nLet me confirm that. 60 minutes make an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours. So, yes, 8 hours and 30 minutes is 8.5 hours.\n\nNow, plugging the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 550 \\times 8.5 \\]\n\nHmm, let's do the math here. 550 multiplied by 8 is 4,400, and 550 multiplied by 0.5 is 275. So, adding them together:\n\n\\[ 4,400 + 275 = 4,675 \\]\n\nTherefore, the plane travels 4,675 miles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert 8 hours and 30 minutes entirely into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 hours is 480 minutes, plus 30 minutes, which totals 510 minutes.\n\nNow, the speed is 550 miles per hour. To find the distance in miles, I can convert the speed into miles per minute.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 550 miles per hour is:\n\n\\[ 550 \\div 60 = 9.1667 \\, \\text{miles per minute} \\]\n\nNow, multiplying that by the total minutes:\n\n\\[ 9.1667 \\times 510 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 9 times 510 is 4,590.\n\nThen, 0.1667 times 510 is approximately 85.\n\nSo, adding them up: 4,590 + 85 = 4,675 miles.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the plane travels 4,675 miles.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps using the formula for distance in terms of speed and time, but ensuring that the units are consistent.\n\nSpeed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be extra careful, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times time \\]\n\nWhere time is in hours.\n\nGiven that, 8 hours and 30 minutes is 8.5 hours, as we've already established.\n\nSo, again:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 550 \\times 8.5 = 4,675 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be more precise with the time, 8 hours and 30 minutes is exactly 8.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the calculation stands.\n\nSo, the plane travels 4,675 miles.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this, like wind speed or something, but since it's not mentioned in the problem, I think we can ignore that.\n\nThe problem states an average speed, so any variations in speed are already accounted for in that average.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4,675 miles.\n\nLet me write it down one more time to confirm:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 550 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 8.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 4,675 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4675} \\]"
