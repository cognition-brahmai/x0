        "content": "To show that the set of all rational numbers is countable, we need to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of rational numbers and the set of natural numbers. In other words, we need to find a way to list all rational numbers in a sequence such that each rational number appears exactly once.\n\nFirst, let's recall that rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. So, any rational number can be written in the form p/q, where p and q are integers, and q \u2260 0.\n\nNow, to make this more concrete, let's consider positive rational numbers first. We can arrange them in a grid where the numerator increases along one axis and the denominator along the other. For example:\n\n1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...\n\n2/1, 2/2, 2/3, 2/4, ...\n\n3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, ...\n\n4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, ...\n\nand so on.\n\nHowever, this grid contains many duplicates, such as 1/1 = 2/2 = 3/3 = ..., which are all equal to 1. To avoid counting duplicates, we can only consider rational numbers in their simplest form, i.e., where p and q have no common divisors other than 1.\n\nTo list all these unique positive rational numbers, we can traverse the grid diagonally. Starting from 1/1, then move to 2/1 and 1/2, then to 3/1, 2/2, and 1/3, and so on. However, since 2/2 is not in its simplest form, we skip it.\n\nSo, the sequence would look like:\n\n1/1, 2/1, 1/2, 3/1, 1/3, 4/1, 3/2, 2/3, 1/4, ...\n\nThis way, every positive rational number appears exactly once in the sequence.\n\nNow, to include negative rational numbers and zero, we can interleave them with the positive ones. For example, we can list zero first, then list a positive rational number, followed by its negative counterpart.\n\nSo, the sequence becomes:\n\n0, 1/1, -1/1, 2/1, -2/1, 1/2, -1/2, 3/1, -3/1, 1/3, -1/3, 4/1, -4/1, 3/2, -3/2, 2/3, -2/3, 1/4, -1/4, ...\n\nThis way, every rational number, whether positive, negative, or zero, appears exactly once in the sequence.\n\nSince we have established a one-to-one correspondence between the set of rational numbers and the set of natural numbers (as each rational number is assigned a unique position in the sequence), we can conclude that the set of all rational numbers is countable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The set of all rational numbers is countable.}}"
