        "content": "So I've got this problem here about building a fence around a rectangular garden with an additional 1-meter buffer on all sides. The garden is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide. I need to find out what the length and width of the fenced area will be.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the situation. There's a rectangular garden that measures 15 meters in length and 8 meters in width. Now, I need to build a fence around it, but not right against the garden. Instead, I have to leave an extra 1 meter on all sides of the garden. That means the fence will be 1 meter away from the garden on every side.\n\nSo, if I imagine the garden, and then imagine adding 1 meter all around it for the fence, the fenced area will be larger than the garden itself.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out mentally. If the garden is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I add 1 meter to each side, I need to consider that the buffer is added to both sides of each dimension.\n\nFor the length:\n\nThe original length is 15 meters. Adding 1 meter to one end and 1 meter to the other end means the total addition to the length is 1 + 1 = 2 meters. So, the length of the fenced area should be 15 meters + 2 meters = 17 meters.\n\nSimilarly, for the width:\n\nThe original width is 8 meters. Adding 1 meter to one side and 1 meter to the other side means the total addition to the width is also 1 + 1 = 2 meters. So, the width of the fenced area should be 8 meters + 2 meters = 10 meters.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nIf I have a garden that's 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I add 1 meter around it, it's like expanding the garden by 1 meter in every direction.\n\nSo, the new length should indeed be original length plus 2 meters (1 meter on each end), and the new width should be original width plus 2 meters (1 meter on each side).\n\nSo, length of fenced area = 15 + 2 = 17 meters.\n\nWidth of fenced area = 8 + 2 = 10 meters.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the perimeter. The perimeter of the garden is 2 times length plus 2 times width, which is 2*15 + 2*8 = 30 + 16 = 46 meters. But that's not directly relevant here because we're not being asked for the perimeter of the fenced area, just the length and width.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate the perimeter of the fenced area to confirm.\n\nIf the fenced area is 17 meters long and 10 meters wide, then the perimeter would be 2*17 + 2*10 = 34 + 20 = 54 meters.\n\nBut again, since the question only asks for the length and width of the fenced area, I don't need to calculate the perimeter. I've already determined that the length is 17 meters and the width is 10 meters.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose I consider the garden and the buffer as a larger rectangle that encompasses both the garden and the buffer zone.\n\nThe buffer is 1 meter wide on all sides, so it's like adding 1 meter to each side of the garden.\n\nTherefore, the total addition to the length is 2 meters (1 meter on each end), and the total addition to the width is also 2 meters (1 meter on each side).\n\nSo, again, length of fenced area = 15 + 2 = 17 meters.\n\nWidth of fenced area = 8 + 2 = 10 meters.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe length of the fenced area is \\boxed{17} meters and the width is \\boxed{10} meters."
