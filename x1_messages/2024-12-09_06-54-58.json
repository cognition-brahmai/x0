        "content": "So the fruit seller had 50 oranges in total. On the first day, he sold 40% of them, and the rest were sold on the second day. I need to find out how many oranges he sold on the second day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many oranges he sold on the first day. Since he sold 40% of the 50 oranges on the first day, I can calculate that by multiplying 50 by 40%.\n\nBut wait, percentages can be tricky. I remember that 40% is the same as 40 per 100, or 0.4 in decimal form. So, to find 40% of 50, I can multiply 50 by 0.4.\n\nLet me do that: 50 times 0.4 is 20. So, he sold 20 oranges on the first day.\n\nNow, to find out how many he sold on the second day, I need to subtract the number of oranges sold on the first day from the total number of oranges he had.\n\nTotal oranges are 50, and he sold 20 on the first day. So, 50 minus 20 equals 30.\n\nTherefore, he sold 30 oranges on the second day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can calculate the percentage of oranges sold on the second day and then find the number.\n\nIf he sold 40% on the first day, then the remaining percentage sold on the second day would be 100% minus 40%, which is 60%.\n\nSo, if he sold 60% of the oranges on the second day, I can calculate 60% of 50 to find out how many that is.\n\nAgain, 60% is 0.6 in decimal form. So, 50 times 0.6 equals 30.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 30 oranges sold on the second day.\n\nIt's good to cross-verify like this to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
