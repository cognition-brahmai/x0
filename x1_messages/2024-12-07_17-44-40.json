        "content": "So I have this function g(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1, and I need to find its derivative. I'm a bit rusty on derivatives, but I remember that the derivative of a function gives you the slope of the tangent line at any point on the function. So, for g(x), the derivative g'(x) will tell me how the function is changing at any given x.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the basic rules for differentiation. I think the power rule is important here. The power rule says that if you have a function like x^n, where n is any real number, then the derivative is n*x^(n-1). So, for example, the derivative of x^3 would be 3x^2.\n\nOkay, so let's apply that to each term in g(x).\n\nStarting with x^3:\n\nDerivative of x^3 is 3x^2.\n\nNext, -4x^2:\n\nI need to bring down the exponent as a coefficient and then reduce the exponent by one. So, -4 times 2 is -8, and x^(2-1) is x^1, so -8x.\n\nWait, but I think I should double-check that. Actually, the power rule applies to each term separately, and constants multiply through. So, for -4x^2, it's -4 * (2x^(2-1)) = -8x.\n\nAlright, moving on to 6x:\n\nThe derivative of 6x should be 6, because the exponent of x is 1, so 6*x^0 = 6*1 = 6.\n\nAnd finally, -1:\n\nThe derivative of a constant is zero, so -1 becomes 0.\n\nNow, putting it all together, g'(x) should be:\n\n3x^2 - 8x + 6.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. Let's go through each term again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nx^3: 3x^2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n-4x^2: -8x \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6x: 6 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n-1: 0 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, adding those up, g'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 6.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there are any other rules I need to consider, like the product rule or quotient rule. But in this case, since g(x) is a polynomial and all the terms are added together, I can differentiate each term separately, which is what I did.\n\nAnother thing I could do is to see if there are any like terms or anything that I need to combine, but in this case, each term has a different exponent, so no need to combine anything.\n\nSo, I think g'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 6 is the correct derivative of g(x).\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can plug in a value for x and see if it makes sense. Let's say x = 1.\n\nFirst, g(1) = (1)^3 - 4*(1)^2 + 6*(1) - 1 = 1 - 4 + 6 - 1 = 2.\n\nNow, g'(x) at x = 1 is 3*(1)^2 - 8*(1) + 6 = 3 - 8 + 6 = 1.\n\nSo, the slope at x = 1 is 1. Does that make sense? Well, I don't have a graph in front of me, but mathematically, it seems consistent.\n\nLet me try another point, say x = 2.\n\ng(2) = (2)^3 - 4*(2)^2 + 6*(2) - 1 = 8 - 16 + 12 - 1 = 3.\n\ng'(2) = 3*(2)^2 - 8*(2) + 6 = 12 - 16 + 6 = 2.\n\nSo, at x = 2, the slope is 2. Again, without a graph, it's hard to verify intuitively, but the calculations seem consistent.\n\nI think I've got it right. The derivative of g(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1 is g'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3x^{2} - 8x + 6} \\]"
