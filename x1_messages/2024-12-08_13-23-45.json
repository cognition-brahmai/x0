        "content": "To create a Java program that uploads a file to Google Cloud Storage and retrieves its public URL, you'll need to set up a Google Cloud project, enable the Cloud Storage API, create a service account, and download the JSON key file for authentication. Then, you can use the Google Cloud Storage client library in your Java application.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Set up Google Cloud Project\n\n1. **Create a Google Cloud project** if you don't have one already.\n2. **Enable the Cloud Storage API** for your project.\n3. **Create a service account** and download the JSON key file. This file will be used for authentication.\n\n### Step 2: Create a Cloud Storage Bucket\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Storage Browser](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser).\n2. Create a new bucket where you'll upload your files.\n\n### Step 3: Install Google Cloud Storage Client Library\n\nAdd the Google Cloud Storage client library to your Java project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>\n    <artifactId>google-cloud-storage</artifactId>\n    <version>2.4.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n### Step 4: Write the Java Program\n\nCreate a Java class with the following code. Make sure to replace placeholders with your actual values.\n\n```java\nimport com.google.cloud.storage.*;\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class GcsUploader {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Replace with your service account key file path\n        String keyFilePath = \"path/to/your-service-account-key.json\";\n        // Replace with your bucket name\n        String bucketName = \"your-bucket-name\";\n        // Replace with your local file path\n        String sourceFilePath = \"path/to/your/local/file.txt\";\n        // Replace with the desired destination object name\n        String destinationObjectName = \"uploaded-file.txt\";\n\n        try {\n            // Set up the credentials\n            Storage storage = StorageOptions.newBuilder()\n                    .setCredentials(GoogleCredentials.fromStream(new FileInputStream(keyFilePath)))\n                    .build()\n                    .getService();\n\n            // Upload the file\n            BlobId blobId = BlobId.of(bucketName, destinationObjectName);\n            BlobInfo blobInfo = BlobInfo.newBuilder(blobId).setContentType(\"text/plain\").build();\n            storage.create(blobInfo, Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(sourceFilePath)));\n\n            // Make the file publicly accessible\n            Acl acl = Acl.of(Acl.User.ofAllUsers(), Acl.Role.READER);\n            storage.createAcl(bucketName, destinationObjectName, acl);\n\n            // Get the public URL\n            String publicUrl = String.format(\"https://storage.googleapis.com/%s/%s\", bucketName, destinationObjectName);\n            System.out.println(\"File uploaded successfully. Public URL: \" + publicUrl);\n\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Authentication**: The program uses a service account key file for authentication.\n2. **Upload File**: It reads the local file and uploads it to the specified bucket with a given object name.\n3. **Make Public**: It sets the appropriate ACL to make the uploaded file publicly readable.\n4. **Public URL**: It constructs and prints the public URL of the uploaded file.\n\n### Step 5: Run the Program\n\nCompile and run your Java program. Ensure that the paths to the key file and the local file are correct.\n\nThis should upload your file to Google Cloud Storage and print the public URL where it can be accessed."
