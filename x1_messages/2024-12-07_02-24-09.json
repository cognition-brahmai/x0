        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 4 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 6 green balls. So, total number of balls is 4 + 5 + 6, which is 15 balls. I need to draw 3 balls at random without replacement, and I want to find the probability that I get exactly one ball of each color.\n\nOkay, so without replacement means that once I draw a ball, it stays out and doesn't go back into the bag. That affects the probabilities for the subsequent draws.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 15. Since the order doesn't matter, that's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 15 is C(15, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3! * (15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455.\n\nSo, there are 455 different combinations of 3 balls from 15.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to get exactly one ball of each color. That means one red, one blue, and one green ball.\n\nSince the balls are distinct by color, I can calculate the number of ways to choose one red, one blue, and one green separately, and then multiply those together.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one red ball from four is C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one blue ball from five is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one green ball from six is C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose one of each color is 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nProbability = 120 / 455.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction. Both 120 and 455 are divisible by 5.\n\n120 \u00f7 5 = 24\n\n455 \u00f7 5 = 91\n\nSo, 24/91.\n\nWait, is that the simplest form? Let's check if 24 and 91 have any common factors.\n\n24 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3.\n\n91 is 7 \u00d7 13.\n\nNo common factors, so 24/91 is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 24/91.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should consider the order in which I draw the balls. Wait, no, because combinations don't consider order. Since we're dealing with combinations here, order doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem step by step, considering the probability at each draw.\n\nFirst draw: I can draw any ball, but since I need one of each color eventually, I'll consider the probability of drawing a specific sequence, like red first, then blue, then green, and then multiply by the number of possible sequences.\n\nProbability of drawing a red ball first: 4/15.\n\nThen, without replacement, there are 14 balls left.\n\nProbability of drawing a blue ball next: 5/14.\n\nThen, without replacement, there are 13 balls left.\n\nProbability of drawing a green ball next: 6/13.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing red, then blue, then green is (4/15) \u00d7 (5/14) \u00d7 (6/13).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 4/15 \u00d7 5/14 = (4 \u00d7 5) / (15 \u00d7 14) = 20 / 210 = 2/21.\n\nThen, 2/21 \u00d7 6/13 = 12 / 273 = 4 / 91.\n\nSo, the probability for that specific sequence is 4/91.\n\nBut there are other sequences that result in one of each color. Specifically, there are 3! = 6 possible orders to draw one of each color: RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BGR, BRG.\n\nWait, but in this case, since we're dealing with combinations, the order doesn't matter, so multiplying by 6 would be incorrect because combinations already account for all possible orders.\n\nWait a minute, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWhen I use combinations, I'm already considering all possible ways to choose one of each color without regard to order, and dividing by the total number of ways to choose any 3 balls, which also doesn't consider order.\n\nSo, the approach I took initially should be correct: 120 favorable combinations out of 455 total combinations, simplifying to 24/91.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the sequential probabilities, I need to account for all possible orders.\n\nSo, probability for one specific order is 4/15 \u00d7 5/14 \u00d7 6/13 = 4/91, as I calculated.\n\nSince there are 6 possible orders, total probability would be 6 \u00d7 (4/91) = 24/91.\n\nWait, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, both approaches give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 24/91.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{91}} \\]"
