He was a student of Socrates and went on to establish the Academy in Athens, which was one of the earliest institutions of higher learning in the Western world. Plato's works primarily take the form of dialogues, in which Socrates often plays the central role engaging in philosophical discussions with various interlocutors. These dialogues cover a wide range of philosophical topics including ethics, politics, metaphysics, and epistemology."
