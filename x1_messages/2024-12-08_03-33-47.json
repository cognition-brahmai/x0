        "content": "Let's break this down step by step. So, the car rental company has a total of 120 cars. On a particular day, they rent out 75% of them. First, I need to find out how many cars that is.\n\nTo find 75% of 120, I can multiply 120 by 0.75. Let me do that:\n\n120 * 0.75 = 90 cars\n\nSo, they rent out 90 cars on that day.\n\nNext, each rented car brings in an average of $80. To find the total revenue, I need to multiply the number of rented cars by the average revenue per car.\n\nTotal revenue = number of rented cars * average revenue per car\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal revenue = 90 * 80\n\nNow, 90 multiplied by 80. Let's see:\n\n90 * 80 = 7200\n\nSo, the company generates $7200 in revenue that day.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Are there any additional costs or variables mentioned? Nope, just the number of cars, the percentage rented, and the average revenue per car. So, $7200 should be the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, 75% of 120 cars:\n\n120 * 0.75 = 90 cars. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 90 cars rented at $80 each:\n\n90 * 80 = 7200. Yeah, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 100% of 120 is 120, 75% is 90, and then 90 times 80 is 7200.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to think in terms of total possible revenue if all cars were rented, that would be 120 * 80 = 9600, and then 75% of that would be 9600 * 0.75 = 7200. Same answer.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the revenue generated is $7200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7200} \\]"
