        "content": "So the national park is looking to increase its visitor capacity by building new campgrounds. Each campground can hold up to 100 tents, and each tent can have up to 4 people. The park has a budget of $300,000 for this project, and each campground costs $50,000 to build. I need to figure out how many campgrounds can be built within that budget and then determine the maximum number of visitors that can be accommodated in these new campgrounds.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many campgrounds can be built with $300,000, given that each campground costs $50,000. To do this, I'll divide the total budget by the cost per campground:\n\nNumber of campgrounds = Total budget / Cost per campground\nNumber of campgrounds = $300,000 / $50,000\nNumber of campgrounds = 6\n\nSo, the park can build 6 campgrounds within their budget.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the maximum number of visitors that can be accommodated in these 6 campgrounds. Each campground has 100 tents, and each tent can hold up to 4 people. So, first, I'll find out how many people can be in one campground:\n\nPeople per campground = Number of tents per campground \u00d7 People per tent\nPeople per campground = 100 \u00d7 4\nPeople per campground = 400\n\nNow, to find the total maximum number of visitors for all 6 campgrounds:\n\nTotal visitors = Number of campgrounds \u00d7 People per campground\nTotal visitors = 6 \u00d7 400\nTotal visitors = 2,400\n\nTherefore, the park can build 6 new campgrounds within their $300,000 budget, which can accommodate a maximum of 2,400 visitors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]"
