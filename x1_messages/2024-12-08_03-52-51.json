The total budget for the project is $5 billion, with 40% allocated to buses, 30% to trams, and 30% to subways. Calculate the individual budgets for each mode of transportation, and estimate the number of vehicles needed based on an average cost per vehicle ($500,000 for buses, $2 million for trams, and $10 million for subway cars). Additionally, consider maintenance costs at 10% of the initial investment per year."

        "content": "So the city is planning this big public transportation project, and they've got a budget of $5 billion for it. They've divided the budget into three parts: 40% for buses, 30% for trams, and 30% for subways. First, I need to calculate how much money is allocated to each mode of transportation.\n\nStarting with the buses: 40% of $5 billion. To calculate that, I can multiply 5 billion by 0.40.\n\n5,000,000,000 * 0.40 = 2,000,000,000\n\nSo, $2 billion is allocated for buses.\n\nNext, trams have 30% of the budget. So, 5 billion multiplied by 0.30.\n\n5,000,000,000 * 0.30 = 1,500,000,000\n\nThat's $1.5 billion for trams.\n\nSimilarly, subways also get 30%:\n\n5,000,000,000 * 0.30 = 1,500,000,000\n\nSo, $1.5 billion for subways as well.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the number of vehicles needed for each type based on their average costs.\n\nFor buses, the average cost per vehicle is $500,000. So, with a $2 billion budget, the number of buses they can buy is:\n\n2,000,000,000 / 500,000 = 4,000 buses\n\nFor trams, each costs $2 million:\n\n1,500,000,000 / 2,000,000 = 750 trams\n\nAnd for subway cars, each costs $10 million:\n\n1,500,000,000 / 10,000,000 = 150 subway cars\n\nAlright, so that's the number of vehicles they can purchase with the allocated budgets.\n\nBut there's also a consideration for maintenance costs, which are estimated at 10% of the initial investment per year.\n\nFirst, let's find the total initial investment, which is the $5 billion. So, maintenance costs would be:\n\n5,000,000,000 * 0.10 = 500,000,000 per year\n\nThat's $500 million per year for maintenance.\n\nBut perhaps they want maintenance costs broken down by each mode as well.\n\nFor buses:\n\n2,000,000,000 * 0.10 = 200,000,000 per year\n\nFor trams:\n\n1,500,000,000 * 0.10 = 150,000,000 per year\n\nAnd for subways:\n\n1,500,000,000 * 0.10 = 150,000,000 per year\n\nSo, altogether, that's 200 + 150 + 150 = 500 million per year, which matches the total earlier.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just estimates, and actual costs might vary based on various factors like inflation, changes in vehicle costs, and differing maintenance requirements.\n\nAlso, this calculation assumes that the entire budget is spent on purchasing vehicles, which might not be the case. There could be other expenses like infrastructure development, staffing, administrative costs, and so on.\n\nBut based on the information provided, this is a straightforward calculation of how the budget is divided and how many vehicles can be purchased with those allocations, along with estimated annual maintenance costs.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Buses:**\n\n  - Budget: $2,000,000,000\n\n  - Number of buses: 4,000\n\n  - Annual maintenance: $200,000,000\n\n- **Trams:**\n\n  - Budget: $1,500,000,000\n\n  - Number of trams: 750\n\n  - Annual maintenance: $150,000,000\n\n- **Subways:**\n\n  - Budget: $1,500,000,000\n\n  - Number of subway cars: 150\n\n  - Annual maintenance: $150,000,000\n\n- **Total:**\n\n  - Initial investment: $5,000,000,000\n\n  - Annual maintenance: $500,000,000\n\n**Note:** These calculations are based on the given percentages and average costs per vehicle, and do not account for other potential expenses in the transportation project."
