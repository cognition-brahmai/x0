        "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that proof by mathematical induction! So, we want to prove that for all positive integers \\( n \\), the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers is equal to \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). In other words:\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\]\n\nMathematical induction is a method used to prove statements about all positive integers. It consists of two main steps:\n\n1. **Base Case:** Show that the statement holds for the smallest positive integer, which is usually \\( n = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\), and then prove that if it holds for \\( k \\), it must also hold for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\nLet's go through these steps one by one.\n\n### Step 1: Base Case\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), the left-hand side of the equation is simply 1, and the right-hand side is \\( \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\). Since both sides are equal, the base case holds.\n\n### Step 2: Inductive Step\n\nAssume that the statement is true for some positive integer \\( k \\). That is, assume that:\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\]\n\nThis is called the inductive hypothesis. Now, we need to show that the statement is also true for \\( k + 1 \\). In other words, we need to prove that:\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k + (k+1) = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\]\n\nLet's start with the left-hand side of this equation:\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k + (k+1) \\]\n\nUsing the inductive hypothesis, we can replace the sum up to \\( k \\) with \\( \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) \\]\n\nNow, we need to simplify this expression to show that it equals \\( \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\).\n\nFirst, let's factor out \\( k+1 \\) from both terms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = (k+1) \\left( \\frac{k}{2} + 1 \\right) \\]\n\nNext, combine the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ (k+1) \\left( \\frac{k}{2} + 1 \\right) = (k+1) \\left( \\frac{k + 2}{2} \\right) \\]\n\nNow, multiply \\( k+1 \\) by \\( \\frac{k + 2}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ (k+1) \\cdot \\frac{k + 2}{2} = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\]\n\nThis matches the right-hand side of what we wanted to prove for \\( k + 1 \\). Therefore, if the statement is true for \\( k \\), it is also true for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we have shown that the base case holds and that the truth of the statement for \\( k \\) implies its truth for \\( k + 1 \\), by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \\( n \\).\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\]\n\nfor all \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\nI hope this helps!
