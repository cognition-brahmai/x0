        "content": "Let's see. The factory originally produces 150 widgets per hour. They're increasing production by 25%. So, first I need to find out what 25% of 150 is and then add that to the original production rate to find the new production rate. After that, I can calculate how many widgets are produced in 8 hours at the new rate.\n\nOkay, so 25% of 150 is calculated as (25/100) * 150. That would be 0.25 times 150, which is 37.5. So, the production increases by 37.5 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, adding that to the original production: 150 + 37.5 = 187.5 widgets per hour.\n\nWait, but widgets are typically whole items, so producing half a widget doesn't make sense. Maybe I should consider if the problem allows for fractional widgets or if I need to round to the nearest whole number. But for now, I'll proceed with 187.5 widgets per hour.\n\nNext, to find out how many widgets are produced in 8 hours at this new rate, I multiply the hourly production by 8: 187.5 * 8.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 187.5 times 8.\n\nWell, 187 times 8 is 1496, and 0.5 times 8 is 4, so total 1500 widgets.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nActually, 187.5 * 8 should be 1500, because 100 * 8 is 800, 80 * 8 is 640, 7 * 8 is 56, and 0.5 * 8 is 4. Adding those up: 800 + 640 is 1440, plus 56 is 1496, plus 4 is indeed 1500.\n\nSo, the factory produces 1500 widgets in 8 hours at the increased production rate.\n\nBut, considering that widgets are whole items, perhaps the factory can't produce half a widget per hour. Maybe the increase should be interpreted differently. Perhaps they round up or down to the nearest whole number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original production rate or the increase is intended to be a whole number. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nOriginal production: 150 widgets per hour.\n\nIncrease: 25% of 150 is 37.5.\n\nSo, new production rate: 150 + 37.5 = 187.5 widgets per hour.\n\nOver 8 hours: 187.5 * 8 = 1500 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the increase is meant to be in whole widgets, so maybe they increase production by 38 widgets per hour, making it 188 per hour, and then 188 * 8 = 1504 widgets.\n\nOr, they could increase to 187 widgets per hour, making 187 * 8 = 1496 widgets.\n\nBut according to the calculation, it's 1500.\n\nWait, but in the real world, factories can't produce half widgets, so perhaps the problem assumes that the increase is in whole widgets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production rate is adjusted to produce whole widgets only.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Perhaps I should consider that the production increase leads to a new production rate of 188 widgets per hour, rounding up from 187.5, and then calculate 188 * 8 = 1504 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, if they round down, it would be 187 widgets per hour, and 187 * 8 = 1496 widgets.\n\nBut according to the mathematical calculation, it's 1500 widgets.\n\nMaybe the problem allows for fractional widgets, or perhaps it's assumed that the production rate is adjusted to a whole number.\n\nTo be safe, I'll go with the initial calculation of 1500 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1500} \\]\n"
