        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a scenario where 3 painters take 4 hours to paint a room. Now, we need to find out how long it would take for 6 painters to do the same job, assuming each painter works at the same rate.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand the relationship between the number of painters and the time it takes to paint the room. It seems like if there are more painters, it should take less time to finish the job. So, there's an inverse relationship between the number of painters and the time required.\n\nLet me try to quantify this. If 3 painters take 4 hours, then the total amount of painter-hours required to paint the room is 3 painters multiplied by 4 hours, which is 12 painter-hours. This is like the total amount of work needed to paint the room.\n\nNow, if we have 6 painters, and we need to find out how many hours it will take for them to complete the same 12 painter-hours of work. Let's denote the time required as \\( t \\) hours. So, 6 painters working for \\( t \\) hours would also amount to 6\\( t \\) painter-hours.\n\nSince the total work required is 12 painter-hours, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 6t = 12 \\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\] hours.\n\nSo, it would take 6 painters 2 hours to paint the same room.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's double-check. If 3 painters take 4 hours, and 6 is double the number of painters, then it should take half the time, which is 2 hours. Yeah, that seems logical.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of work rates. If one painter paints at a certain rate, then two painters would paint twice as fast, three painters three times as fast, and so on.\n\nLet's define the painting rate of one painter as \\( r \\) (room per hour). Then, 3 painters would have a combined rate of \\( 3r \\). Given that they take 4 hours to paint the room, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 3r \\times 4 = 1 \\] room.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 12r = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{1}{12} \\] room per hour.\n\nNow, if we have 6 painters, their combined rate would be \\( 6r = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) room per hour.\n\nTo paint one room at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) room per hour, it would take:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \\] hours.\n\nAgain, we get the same answer: 2 hours.\n\nLet me consider another approach to ensure I'm not missing anything. Perhaps using the concept of man-hours or painter-hours.\n\nTotal work required = 12 painter-hours (as calculated earlier).\n\nIf we have 6 painters, the time required would be the total work divided by the number of painters:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\] hours.\n\nConsistent with previous results.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe considering the time per painter.\n\nIf 3 painters take 4 hours, then each painter is working for 4 hours. So, the total effort is 3 painters \u00d7 4 hours = 12 painter-hours.\n\nIf we have 6 painters, and they all work together, how long would it take to accumulate 12 painter-hours of work?\n\nSince all 6 are working simultaneously, each hour they contribute 6 painter-hours.\n\nSo, to accumulate 12 painter-hours:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\] hours.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any factor I'm missing, like limitations in the room that might affect the number of painters that can work simultaneously. But the problem doesn't mention any such constraints, so assuming the room can accommodate any number of painters working together, the answer should hold.\n\nAlso, the problem states that each painter works at the same rate, so there are no variations in individual painting speeds to consider.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
