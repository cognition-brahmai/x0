        "content": "The term you're looking for is \"supermoon.\" A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with the moon being at or near its closest point to Earth in its orbit, which is known as perigee. During a supermoon, the moon can appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than when it's at its farthest point from Earth, called apogee. This phenomenon is caused by the elliptical shape of the moon's orbit around Earth, which results in varying distances between the two celestial bodies. The combination of the moon being full and at perigee leads to the striking appearance of a larger and brighter moon in the sky."
