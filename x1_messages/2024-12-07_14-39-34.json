        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of people, and 60% of them prefer coffee over tea, while 40% prefer tea. Additionally, there are 36 more people who prefer coffee than those who prefer tea. We need to find out how many people are in the group.\n\nFirst, let's define the total number of people in the group as \\( x \\).\n\nNow, 60% of them prefer coffee, so the number of people who prefer coffee is \\( 0.6x \\).\n\nSimilarly, 40% prefer tea, so the number of people who prefer tea is \\( 0.4x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, there are 36 more people who prefer coffee than those who prefer tea. So, the difference between the number of people who prefer coffee and those who prefer tea is 36.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\( 0.6x - 0.4x = 36 \\)\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\( 0.2x = 36 \\)\n\nNow, to find \\( x \\), we can divide both sides by 0.2:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{36}{0.2} \\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\( x = 180 \\)\n\nSo, there are 180 people in the group.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure this makes sense. If there are 180 people, then 60% prefer coffee:\n\n\\( 0.6 \\times 180 = 108 \\) people prefer coffee.\n\nAnd 40% prefer tea:\n\n\\( 0.4 \\times 180 = 72 \\) people prefer tea.\n\nThe difference is \\( 108 - 72 = 36 \\), which matches the information given in the problem.\n\nLooks good to me!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
