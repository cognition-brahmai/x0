        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. It works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights. I'll guide you through implementing this in C++.\n\nFirst, let's understand the basics of Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Assign a tentative distance value to every node. Set it to zero for the initial node and infinity for all other nodes.\n   - Create a set of unvisited nodes.\n\n2. **Algorithm Execution**:\n   - Select the node with the smallest tentative distance (initially the starting node).\n   - For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node.\n   - If a new calculated tentative distance to a neighbor is less than the previously recorded distance, update the distance.\n   - Mark the current node as visited.\n   - Repeat this process until all nodes are visited or the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited nodes is infinity (which indicates no connection).\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in C++.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Graph Representation**:\n   - We'll use an adjacency matrix to represent the graph. This is a 2D array where `graph[i][j]` represents the weight of the edge from node `i` to node `j`. If there is no edge, we'll set `graph[i][j]` to infinity (or a large value to simulate infinity).\n\n2. **Data Structures**:\n   - We'll use a priority queue to efficiently select the node with the smallest tentative distance.\n   - We'll maintain a distance array to keep track of the shortest distances from the source to each node.\n\n3. **Steps in Code**:\n   - Initialize the distance array with infinity for all nodes except the source, which is set to zero.\n   - Use a priority queue to keep track of nodes based on their tentative distances.\n   - While the priority queue is not empty, dequeue the node with the smallest distance and update the distances of its unvisited neighbors.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <limits.h>\n#include <queue>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to print the shortest distances\nvoid printSolution(int dist[], int V) {\n    cout << \"Node \\t Distance from Source\\n\";\n    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)\n        cout << i << \" -> \" << dist[i] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// Function to find the vertex with minimum distance value, from the set of vertices not yet included in shortest path tree\nint minDistance(int dist[], bool sptSet[], int V) {\n    int min = INT_MAX, min_index;\n\n    for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)\n        if (sptSet[v] == false && dist[v] <= min)\n            min = dist[v], min_index = v;\n\n    return min_index;\n}\n\n// Function that implements Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm for a graph represented using adjacency matrix representation\nvoid dijkstra(int graph[][100], int src, int V) {\n    int dist[V]; // The output array. dist[i] will hold the shortest distance from src to i\n\n    bool sptSet[V]; // sptSet[i] will be true if vertex i is included in shortest path tree or shortest distance from src to i is finalized\n\n    // Initialize all distances as INFINITE and stpSet[] as false\n    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)\n        dist[i] = INT_MAX, sptSet[i] = false;\n\n    // Distance of source vertex from itself is always 0\n    dist[src] = 0;\n\n    // Find shortest path for all vertices\n    for (int count = 0; count < V - 1; count++) {\n        // Pick the minimum distance vertex from the set of vertices not yet processed. u is always equal to src in the first iteration.\n        int u = minDistance(dist, sptSet, V);\n\n        // Mark the picked vertex as processed\n        sptSet[u] = true;\n\n        // Update dist value of the adjacent vertices of the picked vertex.\n        for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)\n\n            // Update dist[v] only if is not in sptSet, there is an edge from u to v, and the total weight of path from src to v through u is smaller than current value of dist[v]\n            if (!sptSet[v] && graph[u][v] && dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + graph[u][v] < dist[v])\n                dist[v] = dist[u] + graph[u][v];\n    }\n\n    // Print the constructed distance array\n    printSolution(dist, V);\n}\n\n// Driver code\nint main() {\n    int V, E, src;\n\n    cout << \"Enter number of vertices: \";\n    cin >> V;\n\n    cout << \"Enter number of edges: \";\n    cin >> E;\n\n    int graph[100][100];\n    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < V; j++) {\n            graph[i][j] = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Enter the edges (u v w):\" << endl;\n    for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {\n        int u, v, w;\n        cin >> u >> v >> w;\n        graph[u][v] = w;\n        // For undirected graph, uncomment below line\n        // graph[v][u] = w;\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Enter the source node: \";\n    cin >> src;\n\n    dijkstra(graph, src, V);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Graph Representation**:\n   - We use a 2D array `graph[100][100]` to store the adjacency matrix. Each cell `graph[i][j]` holds the weight of the edge from node `i` to node `j`. If there is no edge, it is set to 0.\n\n2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n   - We maintain two arrays: `dist[]` to store the shortest distances from the source, and `sptSet[]` to keep track of vertices included in the shortest path tree.\n   - We repeatedly pick the vertex with the minimum distance value from `dist[]` that is not yet in `sptSet[]`, mark it as processed, and update the distances of its adjacent vertices.\n\n3. **Input and Output**:\n   - The user is prompted to enter the number of vertices, edges, and the edges themselves.\n   - Finally, the user specifies the source node, and the program outputs the shortest distances from the source to all other nodes.\n\nThis implementation should work for graphs with non-negative edge weights.
