It's this really famous iron lattice tower that was built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, which was a world's fair held in Paris. Gustave Eiffel designed it, and it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has since become a cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is located on the Champ de Mars in Paris and stands about 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, including its antennas. It held the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level offers stunning views of the Paris skyline.\n\nInterestingly, the tower was almost dismantled and scrapped in 1909, but it was saved because it was repurposed as a wireless telegraph station. Over the years, it has been used for various communication purposes, including radio and television broadcasting.\n\nToday, it's one of the most visited paid monuments in the world, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to ascend it and enjoy the panoramic views of Paris. There are elevators and stairs to reach the different levels, and it's especially beautiful at night when it's illuminated with lights.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the Eiffel Tower is what you're referring to. It's an engineering marvel and a symbol of love and romance, often featured in movies and literature set in Paris."
