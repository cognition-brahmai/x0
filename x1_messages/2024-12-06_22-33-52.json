        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a simple chat server using Ruby's Sinatra framework with WebSocket connections. I need to make sure that users can connect, send messages, and have those messages broadcasted to all other connected users in real-time. Also, I need to store the last 100 messages in memory and show them to new users when they join.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic Sinatra application. Sinatra is a lightweight web framework for Ruby, and it's perfect for small applications like this chat server. I'll need to include the necessary gems in my Gemfile. I'll need 'sinatra' for the framework itself, 'faye-websocket' for handling WebSocket connections, and maybe 'eventmachine' for handling the event loop, although Faye-WebSocket might handle that internally.\n\nLet me start by creating a new directory for my project and setting up the Gemfile.\n\n```\nmkdir chat_server\ncd chat_server\necho \"source 'https://rubygems.org'\" > Gemfile\necho \"gem 'sinatra'\" >> Gemfile\necho \"gem 'faye-websocket'\" >> Gemfile\necho \"gem 'eventmachine'\" >> Gemfile\n```\n\nNow, I'll install the gems.\n\n```\nbundle install\n```\n\nNext, I'll create the main Ruby file for my Sinatra application. Let's call it 'app.rb'.\n\nI need to set up a WebSocket server using Faye-WebSocket. I'll also need to handle connections and broadcast messages to all connected clients.\n\nI should keep a list of all active WebSocket connections and a queue of the last 100 messages.\n\nWhen a new client connects, I'll send them the last 100 messages and add their connection to the list of active connections.\n\nWhen a client sends a message, I'll add it to the message queue (keeping only the last 100 messages) and broadcast it to all connected clients.\n\nWhen a client disconnects, I'll remove their connection from the list of active connections.\n\nI need to make sure that the message queue doesn't grow indefinitely, so I'll keep track of the last 100 messages using an array and truncate it when it exceeds 100 messages.\n\nLet me sketch out the basic structure of the application.\n\nFirst, I'll require the necessary libraries.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'sinatra'\nrequire 'faye/websocket'\nrequire 'json'\nrequire 'eventmachine'\n```\n\nI'll need to set up a before filter to check if the request is a WebSocket upgrade request.\n\nThen, in the route handler, I'll check if the connection is a WebSocket upgrade. If it is, I'll handle the WebSocket connection. Otherwise, I'll serve the chat interface.\n\nI need to set up the HTML page for the chat interface. I'll create a simple HTML file with a text input for messages and a div to display the messages.\n\nI'll serve this HTML file when a non-WebSocket request is made to the root URL.\n\nFor the WebSocket handling, I'll need to manage the connection, receive messages, broadcast messages, and handle disconnections.\n\nI should also handle cases where clients connect but don't send any messages, or if there are errors in the connection.\n\nLet me start by setting up the HTML file.\n\nI'll create a file called 'index.html' in the 'views' directory.\n\n```\nmkdir views\necho \"<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Simple Chat</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id='messages'></div>\n    <input id='message-input' type='text' />\n    <button id='send-button'>Send</button>\n    <script>\n      // JavaScript code for WebSocket connection and message handling\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\" > views/index.html\n```\n\nNow, in the 'app.rb', I'll set up the route to serve the HTML file.\n\n```ruby\nget '/' do\n  File.read('views/index.html')\nend\n```\n\nNext, I'll set up the WebSocket handling.\n\nI need to check if the request is a WebSocket upgrade request and handle it accordingly.\n\nI'll use EventMachine to handle the asynchronous nature of WebSocket connections.\n\nFirst, I need to start the EventMachine loop if it's not already running.\n\nThen, for each WebSocket connection, I'll add it to the list of connections and send the last 100 messages.\n\nWhen a message is received from a client, I'll broadcast it to all connected clients.\n\nWhen a client disconnects, I'll remove its connection from the list.\n\nI need to manage the message queue to keep only the last 100 messages.\n\nLet me define some global variables to hold the list of connections and the message queue.\n\n```ruby\nconnections = []\nmessages = []\n```\n\nI'll need to make sure that these are thread-safe since EventMachine runs in a single thread, but Faye-WebSocket might handle that.\n\nWait, EventMachine uses a single thread for its event loop, so I don't need to worry about multi-threading in this context.\n\nNow, I'll set up the route to handle WebSocket connections.\n\n```ruby\nconfigure do\n  set :server, 'thin'\nend\n\nget '/chat' do\n  request.websocket do |ws|\n    connections << ws\n\n    # Send last 100 messages to the new client\n    messages.last(100).each do |msg|\n      ws.send(msg)\n    end\n\n    ws.on :message do |msg|\n      # Broadcast the message to all connected clients\n      messages << msg.data\n      connections.each { |c| c.send(msg.data) }\n      # Keep only the last 100 messages\n      messages = messages.last(100)\n    end\n\n    ws.on :close do\n      connections.delete(ws)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWait, but I think Faye-WebSocket might not integrate directly with Sinatra in this way. I need to check the correct way to handle WebSockets with Sinatra.\n\nUpon checking, it seems that Faye-WebSocket is typically used with a Rack application, not directly with Sinatra's route handlers.\n\nSo, I might need to set up a custom Rack endpoint for handling WebSockets.\n\nLet me look up how to integrate Faye-WebSocket with Sinatra.\n\nAfter some research, I find that I can use the 'faye-websocket' gem with Sinatra by checking the 'Upgrade' header in the request and handling the WebSocket handshake manually.\n\nHere's an example of how to set up a WebSocket endpoint with Sinatra:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'sinatra'\nrequire 'faye/websocket'\nrequire 'json'\nrequire 'rack'\n\nset :server, 'thin'\n\nget '/' do\n  File.read('views/index.html')\nend\n\nbefore do\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = request.origin || '*'\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Origin, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization'\nend\n\nconfigure do\n  set :static, true\n  set :public_folder, File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/public'\nend\n\nrun Sinatra::Application\n```\n\nWait, I need to set up the WebSocket endpoint.\n\nI'll need to handle the WebSocket handshake and then handle the WebSocket frames.\n\nHere's an example of how to do that:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'sinatra'\nrequire 'faye/websocket'\nrequire 'json'\nrequire 'rack'\n\nset :server, 'thin'\n\nget '/' do\n  File.read('views/index.html')\nend\n\nbefore do\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = request.origin || '*'\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Origin, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization'\nend\n\nconfigure do\n  set :static, true\n  set :public_folder, File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/public'\nend\n\nrun Sinatra::Application\n```\n\nWait, I need to actually handle the WebSocket connection.\n\nLet me try setting up a route for the WebSocket connection.\n\n```ruby\nget '/chat' do\n  request.env['upgraded'] = 'websocket'\n  ws = Faye::WebSocket.new(request.env)\n\n  ws.on :open do |event|\n    connections << ws\n    messages.last(100).each do |msg|\n      ws.send(msg)\n    end\n  end\n\n  ws.on :message do |event|\n    messages << event.data\n    connections.each { |c| c.send(event.data) }\n    messages = messages.last(100)\n  end\n\n  ws.on :close do |event|\n    connections.delete(ws)\n  end\n\n  ws.rack_response\nend\n```\n\nI think this is closer to what I need.\n\nI need to make sure that the 'upgraded' flag is set in the request environment.\n\nAlso, I need to return the WebSocket's rack response at the end.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the 'connections' and 'messages' are defined outside of the route handler so they persist across requests.\n\n```ruby\nconnections = []\nmessages = []\n```\n\nI should probably define them at the top of the file.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the WebSocket connections are handled asynchronously, which EventMachine should take care of since I'm using the 'thin' server.\n\nI should specify 'thin' as the server in the Sinatra configuration.\n\nI already have that in the code above.\n\nNow, for the client-side JavaScript in 'index.html', I need to set up a WebSocket connection to the '/chat' endpoint and handle sending and receiving messages.\n\nLet me add that to the HTML file.\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Simple Chat</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id='messages'></div>\n    <input id='message-input' type='text' />\n    <button id='send-button'>Send</button>\n    <script>\n      const socket = new WebSocket('ws://' + location.host + '/chat');\n\n      socket.addEventListener('open', function (event) {\n        console.log('WebSocket connection opened');\n      });\n\n      socket.addEventListener('message', function (event) {\n        const messagesDiv = document.getElementById('messages');\n        const message = document.createElement('div');\n        message.textContent = event.data;\n        messagesDiv.appendChild(message);\n      });\n\n      document.getElementById('send-button').addEventListener('click', function () {\n        const input = document.getElementById('message-input');\n        const message = input.value;\n        socket.send(message);\n        input.value = '';\n      });\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis should handle connecting to the WebSocket server, displaying incoming messages, and sending messages when the user clicks the 'Send' button.\n\nI should also add some CSS to make it look better, but for simplicity, I'll leave it as is.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the server can handle multiple connections and broadcast messages correctly.\n\nI should test this by opening multiple browser tabs or using multiple browser windows to connect to the chat server and see if messages are broadcasted correctly.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that only the last 100 messages are stored and sent to new users.\n\nI should implement some kind of message formatting or timestamping to make it clearer when messages were sent.\n\nMaybe I can include timestamps in the messages.\n\nI'll modify the server to include a timestamp with each message.\n\nI'll use JSON to structure the messages, including the timestamp and the message text.\n\nLet me adjust the message handling accordingly.\n\nFirst, I'll change the message format to JSON with 'timestamp' and 'message' fields.\n\nOn the server side:\n\nWhen receiving a message from a client, I'll parse it as JSON, add a timestamp, and then broadcast it.\n\nWait, actually, it might be simpler to just include the timestamp on the server side when broadcasting.\n\nSo, when a client sends a message, I'll create a JSON object with the current timestamp and the message text, and then broadcast that.\n\nOn the client side, I'll parse the JSON and display the message with the timestamp.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nFirst, on the server:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'sinatra'\nrequire 'faye/websocket'\nrequire 'json'\nrequire 'rack'\nrequire 'securerandom'\n\nset :server, 'thin'\n\nconnections = []\nmessages = []\n\nget '/' do\n  File.read('views/index.html')\nend\n\nbefore do\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = request.origin || '*'\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Origin, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization'\nend\n\nconfigure do\n  set :static, true\n  set :public_folder, File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/public'\nend\n\nget '/chat' do\n  request.env['upgraded'] = 'websocket'\n  ws = Faye::WebSocket.new(request.env)\n\n  ws.on :open do |event|\n    connections << ws\n    messages.last(100).each do |msg|\n      ws.send(msg)\n    end\n  end\n\n  ws.on :message do |event|\n    msg_data = JSON.generate({ id: SecureRandom.uuid, timestamp: Time.now.to_s, message: event.data })\n    messages << msg_data\n    connections.each { |c| c.send(msg_data) }\n    messages = messages.last(100)\n  end\n\n  ws.on :close do |event|\n    connections.delete(ws)\n  end\n\n  ws.rack_response\nend\n\nrun Sinatra::Application\n```\n\nOn the client side, in 'index.html':\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Simple Chat</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id='messages'></div>\n    <input id='message-input' type='text' />\n    <button id='send-button'>Send</button>\n    <script>\n      const socket = new WebSocket('ws://' + location.host + '/chat');\n\n      socket.addEventListener('open', function (event) {\n        console.log('WebSocket connection opened');\n      });\n\n      socket.addEventListener('message', function (event) {\n        const messageData = JSON.parse(event.data);\n        const messagesDiv = document.getElementById('messages');\n        const message = document.createElement('div');\n        message.textContent = `${messageData.timestamp}: ${messageData.message}`;\n        messagesDiv.appendChild(message);\n      });\n\n      document.getElementById('send-button').addEventListener('click', function () {\n        const input = document.getElementById('message-input');\n        const message = input.value;\n        socket.send(message);\n        input.value = '';\n      });\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis should handle messages with timestamps correctly.\n\nI should also consider adding some error handling, such as handling JSON parsing errors or invalid messages.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to limit the length of messages or implement other forms of message validation.\n\nFor now, this should suffice for a simple chat server.\n\nTo run the application, I'll use the following command:\n\n```\nruby app.rb\n```\n\nThen, I can open multiple browser windows and navigate to 'http://localhost:4567' to join the chat and send messages in real-time.\n\nI should see the last 100 messages when I join, and any new messages should appear instantly in all connected clients.\n\nI need to make sure that the 'public' directory exists for static assets, but since I don't have any, it's okay for now.\n\nI might want to add some basic styling to the chat interface, but that's beyond the scope of this task.\n\nI should also consider implementing user names or some form of user identification, but that would require more complexity, such as user authentication and storing user names with messages.\n\nFor a simple chat server, this should be sufficient.\n\nI need to test this application to ensure that it works as expected.\n\nI'll start the server and open multiple browser tabs to see if messages are broadcasted correctly and if the last 100 messages are displayed to new users.\n\nI should also check what happens when users join and leave the chat, and make sure there are no errors in the console.\n\nIf everything works as intended, then I've successfully created a simple chat server using Sinatra and WebSockets.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a simple chat server using Ruby's Sinatra framework with WebSocket connections, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up the project directory and Gemfile:**\n\n```bash\nmkdir chat_server\ncd chat_server\necho \"source 'https://rubygems.org'\" > Gemfile\necho \"gem 'sinatra'\" >> Gemfile\necho \"gem 'faye-websocket'\" >> Gemfile\necho \"gem 'eventmachine'\" >> Gemfile\nbundle install\n```\n\n2. **Create the main Ruby file (`app.rb`):**\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'sinatra'\nrequire 'faye/websocket'\nrequire 'json'\nrequire 'securerandom'\n\nset :server, 'thin'\n\nconnections = []\nmessages = []\n\nget '/' do\n  File.read('views/index.html')\nend\n\nbefore do\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = request.origin || '*'\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'\n  response['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Origin, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization'\nend\n\nconfigure do\n  set :static, true\n  set :public_folder, File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/public'\nend\n\nget '/chat' do\n  request.env['upgraded'] = 'websocket'\n  ws = Faye::WebSocket.new(request.env)\n\n  ws.on :open do |event|\n    connections << ws\n    messages.last(100).each do |msg|\n      ws.send(msg)\n    end\n  end\n\n  ws.on :message do |event|\n    msg_data = JSON.generate({ id: SecureRandom.uuid, timestamp: Time.now.to_s, message: event.data })\n    messages << msg_data\n    connections.each { |c| c.send(msg_data) }\n    messages = messages.last(100)\n  end\n\n  ws.on :close do |event|\n    connections.delete(ws)\n  end\n\n  ws.rack_response\nend\n\nrun Sinatra::Application\n```\n\n3. **Create the views directory and the HTML file (`views/index.html`):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Simple Chat</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id='messages'></div>\n    <input id='message-input' type='text' />\n    <button id='send-button'>Send</button>\n    <script>\n      const socket = new WebSocket('ws://' + location.host + '/chat');\n\n      socket.addEventListener('open', function (event) {\n        console.log('WebSocket connection opened');\n      });\n\n      socket.addEventListener('message', function (event) {\n        const messageData = JSON.parse(event.data);\n        const messagesDiv = document.getElementById('messages');\n        const message = document.createElement('div');\n        message.textContent = `${messageData.timestamp}: ${messageData.message}`;\n        messagesDiv.appendChild(message);\n      });\n\n      document.getElementById('send-button').addEventListener('click', function () {\n        const input = document.getElementById('message-input');\n        const message = input.value;\n        socket.send(message);\n        input.value = '';\n      });\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n4. **Run the application:**\n\n```bash\nruby app.rb\n```\n\nNow, open multiple browser tabs and navigate to `http://localhost:4567` to join the chat and send messages in real-time. The server will store and display the last 100 messages to new users when they join."
