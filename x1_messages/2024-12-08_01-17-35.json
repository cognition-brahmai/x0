        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a store that sells small, medium, and large items. It says that the store sells twice as many small items as medium items and half as many large items as small items. And it tells me that the store sells 120 medium items per day. I need to find out how many total items it sells per day.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the relationships between the numbers of each type of item sold.\n\n1. The store sells twice as many small items as medium items.\n\n2. It sells half as many large items as small items.\n\n3. It sells 120 medium items per day.\n\nI think I can start by defining variables for each type of item to make this easier. Let's let:\n\n- S = number of small items sold per day\n\n- M = number of medium items sold per day\n\n- L = number of large items sold per day\n\nAccording to the problem, M = 120.\n\nNow, the first relationship is that the store sells twice as many small items as medium items. So, S = 2M.\n\nSince M = 120, then S = 2 * 120 = 240.\n\nNext, the store sells half as many large items as small items. So, L = 0.5S.\n\nSince S = 240, then L = 0.5 * 240 = 120.\n\nNow, to find the total items sold per day, I just need to add up S, M, and L.\n\nTotal = S + M + L = 240 + 120 + 120.\n\nLet's add those up: 240 + 120 is 360, and then 360 + 120 is 480.\n\nSo, the store sells a total of 480 items per day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If M = 120, and S = 2M = 240, and L = 0.5S = 120, then total is indeed 240 + 120 + 120 = 480.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{480} \\]"
