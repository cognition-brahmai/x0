        "content": "So the factory produces 500 units per day, and each unit needs 0.75 kilograms of raw material. I need to find out how much raw material is required for a month with 30 days.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the daily raw material requirement. Since each unit requires 0.75 kg, and they produce 500 units per day, I can multiply the two to find the daily consumption.\n\nSo, daily raw material = 500 units * 0.75 kg/unit\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 500 * 0.75 = 375 kg per day.\n\nNow, to find out the monthly requirement, I need to multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in the month. The month has 30 days, so:\n\nMonthly raw material = 375 kg/day * 30 days\n\nNow, 375 multiplied by 30:\n\n375 * 30 = 11,250 kg\n\nSo, the factory requires 11,250 kilograms of raw material in a month.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this. For example, maybe calculate the total units produced in a month first, and then multiply by the raw material per unit.\n\nTotal units in a month = 500 units/day * 30 days = 15,000 units\n\nThen, total raw material = 15,000 units * 0.75 kg/unit\n\nLet's do that multiplication: 15,000 * 0.75 = 11,250 kg\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of kilograms per unit and units per day, and then scale it up to months, but that seems more complicated when it's not necessary.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the daily consumption and then multiply by the number of days, which is what I did first, or consider the total production and then the material per unit, which is the second method. Both arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that 11,250 kg is correct.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other factors that might affect the raw material requirement, like waste, or if the production rate changes during the month, but based on the information given, the production is constant at 500 units per day, and each unit requires 0.75 kg of raw material, with no mention of waste or variations.\n\nSo, I think 11,250 kg is the correct answer for the monthly raw material requirement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11250 \\text{ kg}} \\]"
