        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. To develop a Python script that reads a text file containing space-separated words and counts the frequency of each word, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Read the file**: Open and read the content of the text file.\n2. **Split the content into words**: Use the space character to split the content into individual words.\n3. **Count the frequency of each word**: Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each word.\n4. **Sort the words by frequency**: Sort the words based on their frequency in descending order.\n5. **Print the top 10 most frequent words**: Output the top 10 words along with their counts.\n\nHere's a sample script that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef read_file(filename):\n    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n        content = file.read()\n    return content\n\ndef count_word_frequency(content):\n    words = content.split()\n    word_count = {}\n    for word in words:\n        if word in word_count:\n            word_count[word] += 1\n        else:\n            word_count[word] = 1\n    return word_count\n\ndef get_top_n_words(word_count, n=10):\n    # Sort the word_count dictionary by value in descending order\n    sorted_word_count = sorted(word_count.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n    # Get the top n words\n    top_n = sorted_word_count[:n]\n    return top_n\n\ndef main():\n    filename = 'sample.txt'  # Specify your file name here\n    content = read_file(filename)\n    word_count = count_word_frequency(content)\n    top_10 = get_top_n_words(word_count, 10)\n    \n    print(\"Top 10 most frequent words:\")\n    for word, count in top_10:\n        print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **read_file(filename)**: This function opens the specified file and reads its content into a string.\n2. **count_word_frequency(content)**: This function takes the content string, splits it into words using space as a delimiter, and counts the frequency of each word using a dictionary.\n3. **get_top_n_words(word_count, n=10)**: This function sorts the dictionary of word counts in descending order by count and returns the top `n` words. By default, `n` is 10.\n4. **main()**: This is the main function that ties everything together. It specifies the filename, reads the file, counts the word frequencies, gets the top 10 words, and prints them.\n\nMake sure to replace `'sample.txt'` with the path to your actual text file. This script assumes that the file contains only space-separated words and no other delimiters like punctuation. If your file contains punctuation, you might need to preprocess the content to remove or handle punctuation appropriately."
