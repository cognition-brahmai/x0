        "content": "Afternoon tea, also known as low tea or cream tea, is a traditional English meal that originated in the 19th century. It was introduced by Anna Maria Russell, the 7th Duchess of Bedford, who felt hungry during the long gap between breakfast and dinner. To satisfy her cravings, she began ordering a tray of tea, bread, and butter in the late afternoon. This practice soon became a social event, and the Duchess began inviting friends to join her for this light meal.\n\nTypical foods served during afternoon tea include sandwiches (often with fillings like cucumber, egg salad, or smoked salmon), scones with clotted cream and jam, and cakes or pastries. Tea is, of course, the beverage of choice, and it is usually served with milk and sugar according to personal preference.\n\nProper etiquette for afternoon tea includes using small, delicate sandwiches without crusts, and scones are traditionally split and spread with clotted cream followed by jam. It's important to handle the delicate porcelain teacups and saucers with care, and to avoid speaking with food in your mouth. Additionally, it's considered polite to finish what's on your plate and to thank the host for the meal.\n\nAfternoon tea is not just about the food; it's also a time for socializing and relaxation. It's a tradition that has been adopted and adapted in many countries around the world, each adding their own twists and flavors to this classic English ritual."
