        "content": "So John has twice as many marbles as Tom, and Tom has 15 marbles. I need to find out how many marbles John has.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"twice as many\" means. If Tom has some number of marbles, and John has twice that amount, then John's marbles are 2 times Tom's marbles.\n\nSo, if Tom has 15 marbles, then John has 2 times 15.\n\nLet me write that down: John's marbles = 2 \u00d7 Tom's marbles\n\nTom's marbles = 15\n\nTherefore, John's marbles = 2 \u00d7 15\n\nNow, 2 times 15 is 30.\n\nSo, John has 30 marbles.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this to make sure I'm correct?\n\nMaybe I can use algebra. Let's assign variables.\n\nLet T be the number of marbles Tom has, and J be the number of marbles John has.\n\nAccording to the problem, J = 2T\n\nAnd T = 15\n\nSo, J = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of ratios. If John has twice as many marbles as Tom, the ratio of John's marbles to Tom's marbles is 2:1.\n\nSo, for every marble Tom has, John has 2.\n\nTom has 15 marbles, so John has 2 for each of Tom's 15.\n\nThat would be 15 \u00d7 2 = 30 again.\n\nAnother way: if I were to divide John's marbles by Tom's marbles, I should get 2.\n\nSo, J / T = 2\n\nGiven T = 15, then J / 15 = 2\n\nTo find J, I can multiply both sides by 15:\n\nJ = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n\nAlright, no matter how I look at it, John has 30 marbles.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. But just to be thorough, maybe I can consider if there's any other interpretation of \"twice as many.\"\n\nFor example, does it mean John has two more marbles than Tom, or does it mean John has double the number of marbles Tom has?\n\nWait, \"twice as many\" definitely means double the number, so 2 times, not two more.\n\nSo, if Tom has 15, John has 2 \u00d7 15 = 30.\n\nIf it were two more, it would be 15 + 2 = 17, but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, if it said \"twice as many more,\" that might be different, but it doesn't.\n\nSo, sticking with John has twice as many marbles as Tom, which is 30.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any possibility that the number could be different based on context.\n\nFor instance, are there any other variables or conditions in the problem that I might have missed?\n\nThe problem states: \"John has twice as many marbles as Tom. If Tom has 15 marbles, how many marbles does John have?\"\n\nThat's all the information given. There are no other variables or conditions to consider.\n\nTherefore, the answer is straightforward: John has 30 marbles.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I can plug the numbers back into the original statement.\n\nOriginal statement: John has twice as many marbles as Tom.\n\nIf Tom has 15, and John has 30, then 30 is indeed twice 15.\n\nSo, the answer checks out.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here. There doesn't seem to be any ambiguity in the problem, and the calculation is simple multiplication.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 30 marbles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
