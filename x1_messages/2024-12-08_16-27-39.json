        "content": "So I have this problem here. There's a rectangular garden that's 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. I need to build a path around it that's 2 meters wide. I'm supposed to find out the area of this path. Alright, let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the garden and the path. The garden is rectangular, so it has two sides that are 30 meters long and two sides that are 20 meters wide. The path is going to surround the entire garden, being 2 meters wide all around.\n\nSo, if the path is 2 meters wide on all sides, that means it adds 2 meters to each side of the garden. Wait, no. Actually, since the path goes around the garden, it adds 2 meters to both the length and the width, but on both sides. Let me think carefully.\n\nThe garden is 30 meters long and 20 meters wide. If I add a 2-meter path around it, the total length will be the garden's length plus 2 meters on one side and another 2 meters on the other side. So, total length would be 30 + 2 + 2 = 34 meters. Similarly, the total width would be 20 + 2 + 2 = 24 meters.\n\nSo, the entire area including the garden and the path is 34 meters by 24 meters. The area of this entire rectangle would be 34 * 24 square meters.\n\nNow, to find the area of just the path, I need to subtract the area of the garden from the total area. The area of the garden is 30 * 20 = 600 square meters.\n\nSo, the area of the path would be (34 * 24) - 600.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 34 * 24.\n\n34 * 20 = 680\n\n34 * 4 = 136\n\nSo, 680 + 136 = 816 square meters.\n\nNow, subtract the garden's area: 816 - 600 = 216 square meters.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the area of the path directly. Since the path is 2 meters wide all around, I can think of it as consisting of two parts: the parts along the length and the parts along the width.\n\nFirst, there are two rectangles along the length: each is 30 meters long and 2 meters wide. So, two of them would be 2 * (30 * 2) = 2 * 60 = 120 square meters.\n\nThen, there are two rectangles along the width: each is 20 meters long but since the path is already 2 meters wide on the sides, the width for these parts would be 2 meters as well. So, two of them would be 2 * (20 * 2) = 2 * 40 = 80 square meters.\n\nBut wait, if I add 120 + 80, that's 200 square meters, which doesn't match the earlier calculation of 216 square meters. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nI think I see the problem. The path surrounds the garden, so the parts along the length are 30 meters long but include the corners, which are being double-counted in this approach.\n\nActually, the path forms a larger rectangle around the garden, and the area of the path is the difference between the areas of the larger rectangle and the garden itself. That's the approach I took first, which gave me 216 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to calculate the area of the path directly, I need to account for the fact that the path consists of two lengths and two widths, but with the corners overlapping.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The path is 2 meters wide all around, so it forms a frame around the garden.\n\nThe outer dimensions are 34 meters by 24 meters, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThe area of the path would be the area of the outer rectangle minus the area of the garden.\n\nSo, again, that's 34 * 24 - 30 * 20 = 816 - 600 = 216 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the path as consisting of four rectangles: two that are 30 meters by 2 meters (the lengths), and two that are 20 meters minus 4 meters (since the path is 2 meters on both sides) by 2 meters (the widths).\n\nWait, that might be a better way to think about it.\n\nThe path along the length is 30 meters long and 2 meters wide, and there are two of them.\n\nSo, area = 2 * (30 * 2) = 120 square meters.\n\nThe path along the width is 20 - 2*2 = 16 meters long (since the path is on both sides), and 2 meters wide, and there are two of them.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the width of the path is 2 meters, and it runs along the width, but the length of these parts would be the width of the garden plus the path on both sides.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nLet me try to visualize this differently.\n\nThe path surrounds the garden, so it's like a border around a rectangle.\n\nThe outer dimensions are 34 meters by 24 meters.\n\nThe area of the path is the area between the outer rectangle and the inner rectangle (the garden).\n\nSo, the area of the path is the area of the outer rectangle minus the area of the inner rectangle.\n\nThat is, 34 * 24 - 30 * 20 = 816 - 600 = 216 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the perimeter of the garden and multiply by the width of the path, but I have to be careful with the corners.\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is 2*(30 + 20) = 100 meters.\n\nIf I multiply this by the path width (2 meters), I get 200 square meters, which is different from the earlier calculation.\n\nBut this method doesn't account for the corners, where the path overlaps.\n\nEach corner is a square of 2 meters by 2 meters, and there are four corners.\n\nSo, the total area of the corners is 4 * (2*2) = 16 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the correct area of the path is the perimeter times the path width minus the overlapping corner areas.\n\nThat is, 100 * 2 - 16 = 200 - 16 = 184 square meters.\n\nWait, now I have two different answers: 216 square meters and 184 square meters.\n\nI must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the first method.\n\nOuter area: 34 * 24 = 816 square meters.\n\nGarden area: 30 * 20 = 600 square meters.\n\nDifference: 816 - 600 = 216 square meters.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nIn the second method, calculating the perimeter times the path width minus the corner overlaps:\n\nPerimeter: 2*(30 + 20) = 100 meters.\n\nPath width: 2 meters.\n\nPerimeter times path width: 100 * 2 = 200 square meters.\n\nEach corner is a 2m x 2m square, so area per corner is 4 square meters.\n\nThere are four corners, so total corner area is 16 square meters.\n\nHowever, in this method, the corners are being added twice in the perimeter calculation, so we need to subtract the corner areas once.\n\nTherefore, the path area should be 200 - 16 = 184 square meters.\n\nBut this contradicts the first method's result of 216 square meters.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nI think the first method is correct because it directly calculates the area difference between the outer rectangle and the inner rectangle.\n\nThe second method might be missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the perimeter method works.\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nActually, when you calculate the perimeter and multiply by the path width, you're essentially calculating the area of a frame around the garden.\n\nHowever, at the corners, the path overlaps, and those overlapping areas are counted twice in this calculation.\n\nTherefore, to get the correct area of the path, you need to subtract the areas of the four corners.\n\nEach corner is a quarter-circle with radius equal to the path width, but in this case, since it's a straight path, each corner is a square of side equal to the path width.\n\nWait, no, the path is straight, so the corners are squares of side 2 meters.\n\nSo, the overlapping area per corner is 2m * 2m = 4 square meters.\n\nWith four corners, that's 16 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the correct path area should be (perimeter * path width) - (4 * corner area) = 200 - 16 = 184 square meters.\n\nBut this doesn't match the first method's result of 216 square meters.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in one of these approaches.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I can divide the path into parts:\n\n1. Two rectangles along the length: each is 30 meters long and 2 meters wide.\n\n2. Two rectangles along the width: each is 20 meters long and 2 meters wide.\n\nBut wait, if I add these up: 2*(30*2) + 2*(20*2) = 120 + 80 = 200 square meters.\n\nThis matches the perimeter method.\n\nHowever, in this approach, the corners are being counted twice, once in the length rectangles and once in the width rectangles.\n\nTherefore, I need to subtract the areas of the four corners to avoid double-counting.\n\nEach corner is 2m x 2m = 4 square meters.\n\nSo, total corner area is 16 square meters.\n\nTherefore, path area = 200 - 16 = 184 square meters.\n\nBut earlier, the first method gave me 216 square meters.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nI need to resolve this.\n\nLet me check the calculations again.\n\nFirst method:\n\nOuter area: 34m * 24m = 816 square meters.\n\nGarden area: 30m * 20m = 600 square meters.\n\nPath area: 816 - 600 = 216 square meters.\n\nSecond method:\n\nPerimeter: 2*(30 + 20) = 100 meters.\n\nPath width: 2 meters.\n\nPerimeter times path width: 100 * 2 = 200 square meters.\n\nSubtract corner overlaps: 4 * (2*2) = 16 square meters.\n\nPath area: 200 - 16 = 184 square meters.\n\nBut these two results don't match.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI think the first method is correct because it directly calculates the area difference between the outer rectangle and the inner rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the path area should be 216 square meters.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a flaw in the second method.\n\nLet me consider that the path is 2 meters wide all around, so the outer dimensions are indeed 34m by 24m.\n\nThe area of the path is the area of the outer rectangle minus the area of the garden.\n\nSo, 34*24 - 30*20 = 816 - 600 = 216 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the path as consisting of two lengths and two widths, but adjusted for the overlapping corners, maybe I need to adjust the calculations.\n\nLet's try this:\n\nThe path along the lengths: two rectangles of 30m long and 2m wide, but since the path is connected at the corners, the actual area for the lengths would be 30m * 2m = 60 square meters each, but minus the corner areas.\n\nSimilarly, for the widths: two rectangles of 20m long and 2m wide, again minus the corner areas.\n\nEach corner is 2m x 2m, but since the corners are shared between the length and width paths, I need to subtract the corner areas from the total.\n\nSo, total path area = 2*(30*2) + 2*(20*2) - 4*(2*2) = 120 + 80 - 16 = 184 square meters.\n\nBut this still doesn't match the first method's result of 216 square meters.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the path along the widths should not be 20m long but less, because the path is already accounting for the corners.\n\nWait, maybe I need to subtract the path width from the garden's width when calculating the width parts.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe path along the lengths is still 30m long and 2m wide, so two of them are 2*60 = 120 square meters.\n\nThe path along the widths is 20m minus twice the path width (since the path is on both sides), so 20 - 2*2 = 16m long, and 2m wide.\n\nSo, two of them are 2*(16*2) = 64 square meters.\n\nTotal path area = 120 + 64 = 184 square meters.\n\nAgain, this doesn't match the first method.\n\nI'm starting to think that the first method is correct, and the path area is indeed 216 square meters, and that the second method is missing something.\n\nMaybe the second method isn't accounting for the fact that the path is built around the outside, and the width parts should be based on the outer dimensions, not the inner dimensions.\n\nLet me try adjusting that.\n\nIf the outer dimensions are 34m by 24m, then the path along the widths would be 24m long and 2m wide, but that includes the corners already.\n\nWait, no, the path is 2m wide around the garden, so the width parts would be 24m - 30m = wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm getting tangled up here.\n\nPerhaps it's better to stick with the first method, which seems straightforward and direct.\n\nCalculate the area of the outer rectangle and subtract the area of the inner rectangle (the garden).\n\nThat gives 34*24 - 30*20 = 816 - 600 = 216 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the area of the path is 216 square meters.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{216} \\]"
