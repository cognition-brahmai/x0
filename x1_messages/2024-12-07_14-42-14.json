I'm a bit rusty on some of this stuff, but I think I can work through it step by step. Let's start by recalling what the principle of least action is all about.\n\nThe principle of least action, also known as Hamilton's principle, states that the path taken by a physical system between two states is the one for which the action is minimized (or more generally, extremized). The action \\( S \\) is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian \\( L \\) over time, where the Lagrangian is the difference between the kinetic energy \\( T \\) and the potential energy \\( V \\) of the system:\n\n\\[ S = \\int L \\, dt = \\int (T - V) \\, dt \\]\n\nSo, to apply this to a simple pendulum, I first need to define the kinetic and potential energies of the system.\n\nA simple pendulum consists of a mass \\( m \\) attached to a massless rod of length \\( l \\), which is fixed at one end and free to swing in a plane. The motion of the pendulum is described by the angular displacement \\( \\theta(t) \\) from the vertical.\n\nFirst, let's find the kinetic energy \\( T \\) of the pendulum. The kinetic energy is given by:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the speed of the mass. To express \\( v \\) in terms of \\( \\theta \\), I need to find the velocity of the mass at the end of the rod.\n\nThe position of the mass can be described in Cartesian coordinates as:\n\n\\[ x = l \\sin \\theta \\]\n\n\\[ y = -l \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nHere, I'm taking the vertical downward direction as positive for \\( y \\), which is a bit unusual, but it makes the potential energy expression simpler later on.\n\nNow, the velocity components are the time derivatives of the position coordinates:\n\n\\[ \\dot{x} = l \\cos \\theta \\, \\dot{\\theta} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = l \\sin \\theta \\, \\dot{\\theta} \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed \\( v \\) is:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{ \\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 } = \\sqrt{ (l \\cos \\theta \\, \\dot{\\theta})^2 + (l \\sin \\theta \\, \\dot{\\theta})^2 } = \\sqrt{ l^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 (\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta) } = l \\dot{\\theta} \\]\n\nSo, the kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{2} m (l \\dot{\\theta})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\]\n\nNext, let's find the potential energy \\( V \\). Assuming the potential energy is due to gravity, and taking the reference level at the lowest point of the pendulum's swing, the height of the mass above this level is:\n\n\\[ h = l - l \\cos \\theta = l (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\]\n\nTherefore, the potential energy is:\n\n\\[ V = m g h = m g l (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\]\n\nNow, the Lagrangian \\( L \\) is:\n\n\\[ L = T - V = \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 - m g l (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\]\n\nAccording to the principle of least action, the path that the system takes is an extremum of the action \\( S \\), which is the integral of the Lagrangian over time:\n\n\\[ S = \\int L \\, dt = \\int \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 - m g l (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\right) dt \\]\n\nTo find the equation of motion, we need to apply the Euler-Lagrange equation, which is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0 \\]\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \\( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 - m g l (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\right) = m l^2 \\dot{\\theta} \\]\n\nNext, compute \\( \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\right) \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( m l^2 \\dot{\\theta} \\right) = m l^2 \\ddot{\\theta} \\]\n\nNow, compute \\( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 - m g l (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\right) = 0 - m g l (-\\sin \\theta) = m g l \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nPutting it all together in the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\n\\[ m l^2 \\ddot{\\theta} - m g l \\sin \\theta = 0 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing both sides by \\( m l \\):\n\n\\[ l \\ddot{\\theta} - g \\sin \\theta = 0 \\]\n\nOr rearranging:\n\n\\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{g}{l} \\sin \\theta = 0 \\]\n\nThis is the equation of motion for the simple pendulum. It's a second-order nonlinear differential equation because of the \\( \\sin \\theta \\) term.\n\nFor small angular displacements, where \\( \\theta \\) is small, we can use the approximation \\( \\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta \\), which simplifies the equation to:\n\n\\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{g}{l} \\theta = 0 \\]\n\nThis is the equation for simple harmonic motion, with angular frequency \\( \\omega = \\sqrt{g / l} \\), and the period \\( T = 2 \\pi \\sqrt{l / g} \\).\n\nBut since the problem asks for the general case without specifying small angles, we'll stick with the nonlinear equation:\n\n\\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{g}{l} \\sin \\theta = 0 \\]\n\nThis is the final equation of motion for the simple pendulum derived using the principle of least action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{g}{l} \\sin \\theta = 0 } \\]"
