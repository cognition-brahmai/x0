This tool is useful in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nTextExtractor[input]: Extracts text from websites given an input string containing newline delimited links.\nLinkPicker[input]: Picks relevant links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nQAModel[input]: Question answering model, useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references a :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based in input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the history behind the construction of Eiffel Tower?"
