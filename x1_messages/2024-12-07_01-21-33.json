        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you create a Node.js script that uploads a local file to Google Cloud Storage. We'll make sure it accepts command-line arguments for the file path, bucket name, and destination object name. And, of course, it will print a confirmation message if the upload is successful.\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js set up, you can create a new JavaScript file for your script, let's say `uploadToGCS.js`.\n\nNow, to interact with Google Cloud Storage from Node.js, we'll use the official Google Cloud Storage client library. You can install it using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @google-cloud/storage\n```\n\nThis will download and install the necessary package.\n\nNext, your script needs to accept command-line arguments. Node.js has a built-in object called `process.argv` that allows you to access command-line arguments. The first element is the Node.js executable path, the second is the path to your script, and the subsequent elements are the arguments you pass.\n\nFor example, if you run:\n\n```bash\nnode uploadToGCS.js /path/to/local/file my-bucket-name destination/object/name\n```\n\nThen:\n\n- `process.argv[2]` will be `/path/to/local/file`\n\n- `process.argv[3]` will be `my-bucket-name`\n\n- `process.argv[4]` will be `destination/object/name`\n\nWe'll use these to get the file path, bucket name, and destination object name.\n\nNow, to authenticate with Google Cloud, you'll need to set up authentication credentials. The easiest way is to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file. You can do this in your terminal before running the script:\n\n```bash\nexport GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"/path/to/your/service-account-key.json\"\n```\n\nOn Windows, you can use:\n\n```bash\nset GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/service-account-key.json\n```\n\nThis tells the Google Cloud client library where to find the credentials for authentication.\n\nNow, let's start writing the script.\n\nFirst, require the necessary modules:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst { Storage } = require('@google-cloud/storage');\n```\n\nNext, parse the command-line arguments:\n\n```javascript\nconst filePath = process.argv[2];\nconst bucketName = process.argv[3];\nconst destinationObjectName = process.argv[4];\n\nif (!filePath || !bucketName || !destinationObjectName) {\n  console.error('Usage: node uploadToGCS.js /path/to/local/file my-bucket-name destination/object/name');\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n```\n\nWe're checking if all three arguments are provided, and if not, printing a usage message and exiting.\n\nNow, create a function to upload the file:\n\n```javascript\nasync function uploadFile(filePath, bucketName, destinationObjectName) {\n  // Create a new instance of the Storage client\n  const storage = new Storage();\n\n  try {\n    // Upload the file\n    await storage.bucket(bucketName).upload(filePath, {\n      destination: destinationObjectName\n    });\n\n    console.log(`${filePath} uploaded to ${bucketName}/${destinationObjectName}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('There was an error uploading the file:', error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses the Google Cloud Storage client to upload the file from the local path to the specified bucket and destination object name. If successful, it prints a confirmation message; otherwise, it catches and logs the error.\n\nFinally, call this function with the provided arguments:\n\n```javascript\nuploadFile(filePath, bucketName, destinationObjectName);\n```\n\nPutting it all together, your `uploadToGCS.js` should look like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst { Storage } = require('@google-cloud/storage');\n\nconst filePath = process.argv[2];\nconst bucketName = process.argv[3];\nconst destinationObjectName = process.argv[4];\n\nif (!filePath || !bucketName || !destinationObjectName) {\n  console.error('Usage: node uploadToGCS.js /path/to/local/file my-bucket-name destination/object/name');\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n\nasync function uploadFile(filePath, bucketName, destinationObjectName) {\n  const storage = new Storage();\n\n  try {\n    await storage.bucket(bucketName).upload(filePath, {\n      destination: destinationObjectName\n    });\n\n    console.log(`${filePath} uploaded to ${bucketName}/${destinationObjectName}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('There was an error uploading the file:', error);\n  }\n}\n\nuploadFile(filePath, bucketName, destinationObjectName);\n```\n\nTo run the script, make sure your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is set, and then execute:\n\n```bash\nnode uploadToGCS.js /path/to/local/file my-bucket-name destination/object/name\n```\n\nReplace the placeholders with your actual file path, bucket name, and destination object name.\n\nThat's it! This script should upload your local file to the specified Google Cloud Storage bucket and print a confirmation message if successful.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo upload a local file to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using a Node.js script, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if needed.\n2. **Google Cloud Storage Client Library**: Install the official Google Cloud Storage client library for Node.js.\n3. **Authentication**: Set up authentication by creating a service account key and setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.\n\n### Installation\n1. **Install the Google Cloud Storage Client Library**:\n   ```bash\n   npm install @google-cloud/storage\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Up Authentication**:\n   - Create a service account key in Google Cloud Console and download the JSON key file.\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     ```bash\n     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"/path/to/your/service-account-key.json\"\n     ```\n     On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/service-account-key.json\n     ```\n\n### Script\nCreate a new JavaScript file, e.g., `uploadToGCS.js`, and add the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst { Storage } = require('@google-cloud/storage');\n\nconst filePath = process.argv[2];\nconst bucketName = process.argv[3];\nconst destinationObjectName = process.argv[4];\n\nif (!filePath || !bucketName || !destinationObjectName) {\n  console.error('Usage: node uploadToGCS.js /path/to/local/file my-bucket-name destination/object/name');\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n\nasync function uploadFile(filePath, bucketName, destinationObjectName) {\n  const storage = new Storage();\n\n  try {\n    await storage.bucket(bucketName).upload(filePath, {\n      destination: destinationObjectName\n    });\n\n    console.log(`${filePath} uploaded to ${bucketName}/${destinationObjectName}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('There was an error uploading the file:', error);\n  }\n}\n\nuploadFile(filePath, bucketName, destinationObjectName);\n```\n\n### Usage\nRun the script from the command line with the required arguments:\n\n```bash\nnode uploadToGCS.js /path/to/local/file my-bucket-name destination/object/name\n```\n\nReplace the placeholders with your actual file path, bucket name, and destination object name.\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dependencies**: The script uses the `fs` module for file system operations and the `@google-cloud/storage` library to interact with GCS.\n2. **Command-Line Arguments**: The script accepts three command-line arguments: file path, bucket name, and destination object name.\n3. **Authentication**: The script uses the service account key JSON file specified in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable for authentication.\n4. **Upload Function**: The `uploadFile` function creates a Storage client, uploads the file to the specified bucket and object name, and logs a confirmation message upon success or an error message if upload fails.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward way to upload files to GCS using Node.js, making it easy to integrate file uploads into your workflow or automated processes."
