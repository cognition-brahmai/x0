What happened?\" Hmm, sounds confusing at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a man who's pushing his car. That suggests that maybe his car broke down or something, so he had to push it somewhere. And he ends up at a hotel. Maybe he's staying at the hotel, or perhaps it's a place where he can get help with his car.\n\nBut then it says he loses all his money. That seems unrelated at first, but probably there's a connection. Maybe he had to pay a lot for something at the hotel, or maybe something happened to his money there.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's a gambling hotel, like a casino. In casinos, people often lose money betting. So, perhaps he pushed his car to a casino hotel, and then he lost all his money gambling.\n\nBut that seems a bit too straightforward. Maybe there's a different twist to it. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother angle could be that he pushed his car to a hotel because he was on a hiking trip or something, and the hotel is at the top of a hill or something like that. But losing all his money doesn't fit well with that scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"pushing his car to a hotel\" is a metaphor for something. But riddles usually aren't that abstract, so perhaps not.\n\nLet me consider the phrase again: \"pushes his car to a hotel.\" What if \"pushes\" doesn't mean physically pushing the car? Maybe it's a different kind of push, like promoting or advertising his car in some way.\n\nWait, that seems too vague. Maybe I should look at the words more carefully.\n\nAnother thought: in some board games, like Monopoly, when you land on a space, certain things happen. Maybe this is related to a board game scenario.\n\nIn Monopoly, for example, if you land on a property, you can buy it, and if you land on a hotel space, there might be some consequence. But I'm not sure if that fits here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's clue-based, and I need to think about words that sound like \"push,\" \"car,\" \"hotel,\" and \"loses all his money.\"\n\nWait, maybe \"push\" is a homophone for \"puss,\" which could relate to a cat. But that seems off track.\n\nLet me think about the phrase \"pushes his car.\" Could \"pushes\" mean something else in this context?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"car\" here doesn't refer to an automobile but to a tool or device called a \"car\" in a different context, like a railway car or something.\n\nBut that might be reaching too far. Probably \"car\" here means a vehicle he drives.\n\nPerhaps he pushed his car to a hotel because it didn't have fuel, and then when he got to the hotel, he had to pay a huge fee for something, losing all his money.\n\nBut that still feels a bit forced.\n\nLet me consider that he pushed his car to a hotel, and then maybe he had to pay for damages or something.\n\nWait, maybe the car was damaged, so he had to push it to the hotel, and then he had to pay for repairs, which cost all his money.\n\nThat could make sense, but I feel like there's a more elegant solution to this riddle.\n\nMaybe it's about cricket or some other sport, where \"push\" could refer to a shot in cricket, and \"hotel\" is something else in that context.\n\nBut that seems too obscure unless specified.\n\nLet me try to think of this as a play on words.\n\n\"A man pushes his car to a hotel and loses all his money.\" Maybe \"pushes his car\" is a phrase that has a double meaning.\n\nWait, in gambling, there's a term \"push\" which means a tie, so no one wins or loses. But that doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"pushing his car\" means he's advertising or promoting it heavily, and \"hotel\" is something else.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps it's a situation where he pushed his car to a hotel, meaning he exerted a lot of effort to get it there, and then he lost all his money.\n\nBut that still doesn't connect everything neatly.\n\nLet me try to think of a scenario where someone pushes their car to a hotel and then loses all their money.\n\nSuppose he's on a beach, and his car is stuck in the sand, so he has to push it to the hotel, and then maybe he has to pay a large sum for something at the hotel, like rescuing his car or something.\n\nBut that seems a bit far-fetched.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a puzzle where the answer is that he was playing Monopoly, and \"pushing his car to a hotel\" means he moved his token from the car space to the hotel space, and \"loses all his money\" means he had to pay a large fee for landing on that hotel.\n\nThat could make sense, especially since in Monopoly, hotels are expensive to purchase or pay rent on.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that he was playing Monopoly, and when he landed on a hotel space, he had to pay all his money as rent.\n\nThat seems like a plausible solution to the riddle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a wordplay where \"pushes his car\" sounds like \"pushes his card,\" as in playing cards, and \"hotel\" could be a type of bet or something in gambling.\n\nBut that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nGiven the information, the Monopoly scenario appears to be the most likely answer.\n\nSo, the man was playing Monopoly, moved his token from the car space to a hotel space on the board, and had to pay all his money as rent because he landed on an opponent's hotel.\n\nThat would explain pushing his car to a hotel and losing all his money in the process.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{He was playing Monopoly and landed on an opponent's hotel, forcing him to pay all his money.}} \\]"
