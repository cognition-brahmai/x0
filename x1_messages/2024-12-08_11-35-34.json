He is indeed famously credited with developing the modern electric light bulb, although it's worth noting that his version was an improvement on earlier designs by other inventors. Edison held 1,093 U.S. patents in his name, covering a wide range of inventions beyond the light bulb, including the phonograph and the motion picture camera. His contributions to technology and innovation have had a lasting impact on the world."
