        "content": "So the factory makes 2000 widgets every day, but 2% of them are defective and can't be sold. I need to find out how many non-defective widgets are produced in a month with 30 days.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many defective widgets are produced each day. If 2% are defective, then the number of defective widgets per day is 2% of 2000.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nDefective widgets per day = 2% of 2000 = (2/100) * 2000 = 40 widgets.\n\nSo, each day, 40 widgets are defective.\n\nNow, the total number of widgets produced per day is 2000, and if 40 are defective, then the number of non-defective widgets per day is:\n\nNon-defective widgets per day = Total widgets per day - Defective widgets per day = 2000 - 40 = 1960 widgets.\n\nNow, to find out how many non-defective widgets are produced in a month with 30 days, I need to multiply the daily non-defective production by 30.\n\nSo,\n\nNon-defective widgets per month = Non-defective widgets per day * 30 = 1960 * 30.\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n1960 * 30 = 58,800 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the factory produces 58,800 non-defective widgets in a month with 30 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the defective widgets per day:\n\n2% of 2000 = (2/100) * 2000 = 40. That seems correct.\n\nThen, non-defective per day: 2000 - 40 = 1960. That's fine.\n\nThen, 1960 * 30 = 58,800. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of percentages. If 2% are defective, then 98% are non-defective.\n\nSo, non-defective widgets per day = 98% of 2000 = (98/100) * 2000 = 1960, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, 1960 * 30 days = 58,800.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 58,800 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{58800} \\]"
