        "content": "So there are 100 people in the room, and including me, that means there are 100 people total. Out of these, 99% have brown eyes. I need to find out how many people do not have brown eyes.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many people have brown eyes. Since 99% of 100 people have brown eyes, I can calculate that by multiplying 100 by 99%.\n\n99% of 100 is calculated as:\n\n(99/100) * 100 = 99 people\n\nSo, 99 people have brown eyes.\n\nNow, to find out how many people do not have brown eyes, I can subtract the number of people with brown eyes from the total number of people in the room.\n\nTotal people - people with brown eyes = people without brown eyes\n\n100 - 99 = 1 person\n\nTherefore, only 1 person in the room does not have brown eyes.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check this because it seems straightforward, but maybe there's a trick here.\n\nLet me think again. There are 100 people in the room, including me. So, if 99% have brown eyes, that means 99 people have brown eyes, and 1 person doesn't. Is there any other way to interpret this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inclusion of \"including me\" is meant to mislead. Let's consider if I have brown eyes or not.\n\nIf I have brown eyes, and 99% of the people have brown eyes, then indeed, 99 people have brown eyes, and 1 does not.\n\nBut if I don't have brown eyes, then out of 100 people, 99 have brown eyes, which would mean I am the one without brown eyes.\n\nWait, but the question says \"including you,\" which means I am counted in the total of 100 people.\n\nSo, if 99% of 100 people have brown eyes, that's 99 people, regardless of whether I have brown eyes or not.\n\nTherefore, the number of people without brown eyes is 1.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
