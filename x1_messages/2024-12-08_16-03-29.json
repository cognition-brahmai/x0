        "content": "The world's largest mammal is the blue whale. It is a marine mammal that can grow up to 100 feet in length and weigh as much as 200 tons. Blue whales are known for their enormous size and their unique filter-feeding system, which allows them to strain small crustaceans, such as krill, from the water. They have baleen plates instead of teeth, which they use to filter their food from the water. Blue whales are found in all the world's oceans and are known for their long migrations between feeding and breeding grounds. They are considered an endangered species due to historical whaling and ongoing threats such as entanglement in fishing gear and habitat destruction."
