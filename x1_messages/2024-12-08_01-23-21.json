        "content": "Let's see. There are 30 people in total. Among them, 15 are men with blue eyes and 10 are women with green eyes. The rest have brown eyes. I need to find out the probability of choosing someone with brown eyes at random.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many people have brown eyes. Total people are 30, men with blue eyes are 15, and women with green eyes are 10. So, the number of people with brown eyes would be the total minus those with blue and green eyes.\n\nSo, number of brown-eyed people = total people - blue-eyed men - green-eyed women = 30 - 15 - 10 = 5.\n\nNow, probability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is selecting a person with brown eyes, which is 5, and the total possible outcomes are 30, since any of the 30 people could be chosen.\n\nTherefore, the probability P(brown eyes) = 5 / 30 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but probabilities are often expressed as decimals or percentages. Let me convert that.\n\n1 divided by 6 is approximately 0.1667, which is about 16.67%.\n\nSo, there's approximately a 16.67% chance that a randomly chosen person from this group has brown eyes.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal people: 30\n\nBlue-eyed men: 15\n\nGreen-eyed women: 10\n\nBrown-eyed people: 30 - 15 - 10 = 5\n\nProbability: 5/30 = 1/6 \u2248 0.1667 or 16.67%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages right from the start.\n\n15 out of 30 people are men with blue eyes, which is 15/30 = 50%.\n\n10 out of 30 are women with green eyes, which is 10/30 \u2248 33.33%.\n\nSo, the percentage of people with brown eyes would be 100% - 50% - 33.33% = 16.67%, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the probabilities step by step:\n\nThe probability of selecting a blue-eyed man is 15/30 = 1/2.\n\nThe probability of selecting a green-eyed woman is 10/30 \u2248 1/3.\n\nThe probability of selecting a person with brown eyes would then be 1 - (1/2 + 1/3) = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6, which again is approximately 16.67%.\n\nSo, all these methods lead me to the same conclusion.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}} \\]"
