        "content": "Let's see what's going on here. Billy started with 20 pencils. He gave half of them to Sally. So, half of 20 is 10. That means Billy gave 10 pencils to Sally. Now, to find out how many pencils Billy has left, I need to subtract the pencils he gave away from his original amount. So, 20 minus 10 equals 10 pencils. So, Billy has 10 pencils left.\n\nWait a minute, the question mentions that Sally ate 3 bananas. Hmm, that seems unrelated to the pencils. Maybe it's just extra information to confuse me. Since bananas don't have anything to do with the pencils, I think I can ignore that part. It doesn't affect how many pencils Billy has.\n\nSo, my final answer is that Billy has 10 pencils left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
