        "content": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. The expression we have is (6 * 5^2 - 10) / 2. Okay, so first things first, I need to remember the order of operations. I think it's PEMDAS or something like that. Yeah, PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, looking at the expression: (6 * 5^2 - 10) / 2.\n\nFirst, I need to handle what's inside the parentheses because parentheses come first in PEMDAS.\n\nInside the parentheses, there's 6 * 5^2 - 10.\n\nNow, within the parentheses, I still need to follow PEMDAS.\n\nSo, exponents first. There's 5^2, which is 25.\n\nNow, the expression inside the parentheses becomes 6 * 25 - 10.\n\nNext, multiplication: 6 * 25 is 150.\n\nSo now, it's 150 - 10.\n\nSubtraction: 150 - 10 is 140.\n\nSo, the expression now is 140 / 2.\n\nFinally, division: 140 divided by 2 is 70.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 70.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me go through it again.\n\nOriginal expression: (6 * 5^2 - 10) / 2.\n\nParentheses first: 6 * 5^2 - 10.\n\nExponents: 5^2 = 25.\n\nSo, 6 * 25 - 10.\n\nMultiplication: 6 * 25 = 150.\n\nSubtraction: 150 - 10 = 140.\n\nNow, divide by 2: 140 / 2 = 70.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there are any other operations or if the parentheses affect anything else, but it seems straightforward.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the order of operations without parentheses, but since there are parentheses, I need to do what's inside them first.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, the parentheses encompass multiple operations, so I have to solve everything inside them before dividing by 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as (6 * 25 - 10) / 2.\n\nWhich is (150 - 10) / 2.\n\nWhich is 140 / 2.\n\nWhich is 70.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to miss something, maybe I would do 6 * 5^2 - 10 / 2.\n\nBut that would be different because without parentheses, the order might change.\n\nBut since there are parentheses, I need to do what's inside them first.\n\nSo, I think 70 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me check if there's any possibility of misinterpreting the exponents or multiplication.\n\n5^2 is definitely 25.\n\n6 * 25 is 150.\n\n150 - 10 is 140.\n\n140 / 2 is 70.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nI don't think there are any tricks in this expression.\n\nSo, the final answer is 70.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
