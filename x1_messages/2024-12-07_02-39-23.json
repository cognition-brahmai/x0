        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: A train travels at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour for a distance of 240 kilometers. I need to find out how long it takes for the train to complete its journey, and I need the answer in hours and minutes. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is 240 kilometers and the speed is 80 kilometers per hour. So, time = 240 km / 80 km/h.\n\nLet me do the math: 240 divided by 80 is 3. So, the time is 3 hours. But the question asks for the answer in hours and minutes. Well, 3 hours is already in hours, and since there are no additional minutes, it's just 3 hours and 0 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I need to consider? Is there a possibility that the train stops along the way or something like that? The problem doesn't mention any stops, so I'll assume it's a non-stop journey at a constant average speed.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The speed is in kilometers per hour and the distance is in kilometers, so that's fine. If they were in different units, I'd need to convert them, but here they're already matching.\n\nLet me double-check my calculation: 240 divided by 80 is indeed 3. No issues there.\n\nSo, the train takes 3 hours to complete its journey. Since it's exactly 3 hours, there are no additional minutes to account for.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the average speed includes any stops. The problem says \"average speed,\" so that probably already accounts for any stops or variations in speed during the journey.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. The answer should be 3 hours and 0 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ hours and } 0 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
