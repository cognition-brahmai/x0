        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Node.js app that connects to a Cassandra database, sets up a table for employees, and adds some sample data. I'm not super familiar with Cassandra, but I've worked with SQL databases before, so I'll try to apply similar concepts here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up a new Node.js project. I'll create a new directory for this project and initialize it with npm.\n\n```\nmkdir cassandra-employees\ncd cassandra-employees\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nNext, I need to install the necessary packages. For connecting to Cassandra from Node.js, I'll use the `cassandra-driver` package.\n\n```\nnpm install cassandra-driver\n```\n\nNow, I need to set up the connection to the Cassandra database. I'll need to know the contact points and possibly the keyspace. For now, I'll assume that Cassandra is running locally on the default port.\n\nI'll create a new file, `app.js`, and start by setting up the connection.\n\n```javascript\nconst cassandra = require('cassandra-driver');\n\nconst client = new cassandra.Client({\n  contactPoints: ['127.0.0.1'],\n  localDataCenter: 'datacenter1',\n  keyspace: 'mykeyspace'\n});\n\nclient.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error('Unable to connect to Cassandra:', err);\n  } else {\n    console.log('Connected to Cassandra');\n  }\n});\n```\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure that the keyspace exists. Maybe I should create it if it doesn't already exist.\n\nI recall that in SQL, you create a database, but in Cassandra, it's called a keyspace. So, I need to create a keyspace if it doesn't exist.\n\nI'll look up the CQL (Cassandra Query Language) for creating a keyspace.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the CQL for creating a keyspace is something like:\n\n```cql\nCREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS mykeyspace WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};\n```\n\nI should execute this statement when connecting to the database.\n\nAlso, I need to create a table within this keyspace. The table should be named \"employees\" with fields id, name, age, and department.\n\nIn SQL, I would do something like:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE employees (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  name VARCHAR(100),\n  age INT,\n  department VARCHAR(100)\n);\n```\n\nI need to translate this into CQL. From what I've read, CQL is similar to SQL, so it should be straightforward.\n\nSo, the CQL for creating the table would be:\n\n```cql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  name TEXT,\n  age INT,\n  department TEXT\n);\n```\n\nNow, I need to insert some sample records into this table. For example:\n\n```\nid: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 30, department: 'HR'\nid: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', age: 25, department: 'IT'\nid: 3, name: 'Alice Johnson', age: 35, department: 'Finance'\n```\n\nIn SQL, I would use INSERT statements like:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30, 'HR');\n```\n\nAgain, CQL should be similar.\n\nSo, putting it all together, here's what my `app.js` might look like:\n\n```javascript\nconst cassandra = require('cassandra-driver');\n\nconst client = new cassandra.Client({\n  contactPoints: ['127.0.0.1'],\n  localDataCenter: 'datacenter1',\n  keyspace: 'mykeyspace'\n});\n\nclient.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error('Unable to connect to Cassandra:', err);\n    return;\n  }\n  console.log('Connected to Cassandra');\n\n  const createKeyspaceQuery = `\n    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS mykeyspace\n    WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1}\n  `;\n\n  client.execute(createKeyspaceQuery, function(err, result) {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error('Unable to create keyspace:', err);\n      return;\n    }\n    console.log('Keyspace created');\n\n    const useKeyspaceQuery = `USE mykeyspace`;\n    client.execute(useKeyspaceQuery, function(err, result) {\n      if (err) {\n        console.error('Unable to use keyspace:', err);\n        return;\n      }\n      console.log('Using keyspace');\n\n      const createTableQuery = `\n        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (\n          id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n          name TEXT,\n          age INT,\n          department TEXT\n        )\n      `;\n\n      client.execute(createTableQuery, function(err, result) {\n        if (err) {\n          console.error('Unable to create table:', err);\n          return;\n        }\n        console.log('Table created');\n\n        const insertQueries = [\n          'INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department) VALUES (1, \\'John Doe\\', 30, \\'HR\\')',\n          'INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department) VALUES (2, \\'Jane Smith\\', 25, \\'IT\\')',\n          'INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department) VALUES (3, \\'Alice Johnson\\', 35, \\'Finance\\')'\n        ];\n\n        insertQueries.forEach(query => {\n          client.execute(query, function(err, result) {\n            if (err) {\n              console.error('Unable to insert data:', err);\n              return;\n            }\n            console.log('Data inserted');\n          });\n        });\n      });\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that Cassandra is actually running locally and that the configuration is correct.\n\nAlso, I should handle errors more gracefully and perhaps close the connection once all operations are done.\n\nMoreover, using callbacks nested like this can get messy. Maybe I should look into using promises or async/await for better readability.\n\nLet me refactor the code to use async/await.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that I'm using a version of Node.js that supports async/await with the cassandra-driver.\n\nI'll check the documentation, but I believe it's supported.\n\nHere's how I can rewrite the code using async/await:\n\n```javascript\nconst cassandra = require('cassandra-driver');\n\nconst client = new cassandra.Client({\n  contactPoints: ['127.0.0.1'],\n  localDataCenter: 'datacenter1',\n  keyspace: 'mykeyspace'\n});\n\nasync function run() {\n  try {\n    await client.connect();\n    console.log('Connected to Cassandra');\n\n    const createKeyspaceQuery = `\n      CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS mykeyspace\n      WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1}\n    `;\n\n    await client.execute(createKeyspaceQuery);\n    console.log('Keyspace created');\n\n    const useKeyspaceQuery = `USE mykeyspace`;\n    await client.execute(useKeyspaceQuery);\n    console.log('Using keyspace');\n\n    const createTableQuery = `\n      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (\n        id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n        name TEXT,\n        age INT,\n        department TEXT\n      )\n    `;\n\n    await client.execute(createTableQuery);\n    console.log('Table created');\n\n    const insertQueries = [\n      'INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department) VALUES (1, \\'John Doe\\', 30, \\'HR\\')',\n      'INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department) VALUES (2, \\'Jane Smith\\', 25, \\'IT\\')',\n      'INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department) VALUES (3, \\'Alice Johnson\\', 35, \\'Finance\\')'\n    ];\n\n    for (const query of insertQueries) {\n      await client.execute(query);\n      console.log('Data inserted');\n    }\n\n    await client.shutdown();\n    console.log('Connection closed');\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error:', err);\n  }\n}\n\nrun();\n```\n\nThis looks much cleaner. Now, errors will be caught by the try-catch block, and the connection will be closed after all operations are done.\n\nI should also make sure that the Cassandra driver is properly installed and that there are no version conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, I might want to parameterize the insert statements to prevent any potential injection attacks, although in this simple example, it's not a big concern.\n\nBut for completeness, I can show how to use prepared statements.\n\nHere's how I can modify the insert part to use prepared statements:\n\n```javascript\n// Prepare the insert statement\nconst insertQuery = 'INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)';\nconst insertStatement = client.prepare(insertQuery);\n\n// Execute the prepared statement with different values\nconst employees = [\n  { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 30, department: 'HR' },\n  { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', age: 25, department: 'IT' },\n  { id: 3, name: 'Alice Johnson', age: 35, department: 'Finance' }\n];\n\nfor (const employee of employees) {\n  await client.execute(insertStatement, [employee.id, employee.name, employee.age, employee.department]);\n  console.log('Data inserted');\n}\n```\n\nThis is safer and more efficient, especially if I'm inserting multiple records.\n\nI should also ensure that the client is properly shut down to close the connections.\n\nNow, to test this application, I need to have Cassandra running locally. If it's not installed, I'll need to download and set it up.\n\nAssuming Cassandra is running, I can execute the `app.js` file:\n\n```\nnode app.js\n```\n\nI should see logs indicating that the connection was established, keyspace and table were created, data was inserted, and the connection was closed.\n\nIf there are any errors, they should be caught and logged.\n\nThis should fulfill the requirements of the task: connecting to Cassandra, creating a table, and inserting sample employee records.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo create a Node.js application that connects to a Cassandra database, creates a table named \"employees\", and inserts sample employee records, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up a new Node.js project:**\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir cassandra-employees\n    cd cassandra-employees\n    npm init -y\n    ```\n\n2. **Install the Cassandra driver:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install cassandra-driver\n    ```\n\n3. **Create and configure the database connection:**\n\n    Create a file named `app.js` and set up the connection to the Cassandra database.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const cassandra = require('cassandra-driver');\n\n    const client = new cassandra.Client({\n      contactPoints: ['127.0.0.1'],\n      localDataCenter: 'datacenter1',\n      keyspace: 'mykeyspace'\n    });\n\n    async function run() {\n      try {\n        await client.connect();\n        console.log('Connected to Cassandra');\n\n        const createKeyspaceQuery = `\n          CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS mykeyspace\n          WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1}\n        `;\n\n        await client.execute(createKeyspaceQuery);\n        console.log('Keyspace created');\n\n        const useKeyspaceQuery = `USE mykeyspace`;\n        await client.execute(useKeyspaceQuery);\n        console.log('Using keyspace');\n\n        const createTableQuery = `\n          CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (\n            id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n            name TEXT,\n            age INT,\n            department TEXT\n          )\n        `;\n\n        await client.execute(createTableQuery);\n        console.log('Table created');\n\n        // Prepare the insert statement\n        const insertQuery = 'INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)';\n        const insertStatement = client.prepare(insertQuery);\n\n        // Sample employees data\n        const employees = [\n          { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 30, department: 'HR' },\n          { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', age: 25, department: 'IT' },\n          { id: 3, name: 'Alice Johnson', age: 35, department: 'Finance' }\n        ];\n\n        for (const employee of employees) {\n          await client.execute(insertStatement, [employee.id, employee.name, employee.age, employee.department]);\n          console.log('Data inserted');\n        }\n\n        await client.shutdown();\n        console.log('Connection closed');\n      } catch (err) {\n        console.error('Error:', err);\n      }\n    }\n\n    run();\n    ```\n\n4. **Run the application:**\n\n    Ensure Cassandra is running locally, then execute the application:\n\n    ```bash\n    node app.js\n    ```\n\n    You should see logs indicating successful connection, keyspace and table creation, data insertion, and proper connection closure.\n\nThis solution sets up a basic Node.js application to interact with a Cassandra database, utilizing async/await for better readability and prepared statements for safety and efficiency."
