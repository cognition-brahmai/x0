        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B each day. That means every day, it produces a total of 500 plus 300 units. So, 500 + 300 equals 800 units per day.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days it will take to reach a total of 10,000 units. Since it makes 800 units each day, we can divide the total required units by the daily production to find the number of days needed.\n\nSo, 10,000 divided by 800. Let me do that calculation. 10,000 divided by 800 is 12.5 days.\n\nBut wait, the factory operates only 6 days a week. So, we need to consider the weekly production as well.\n\nFirst, let's see how many units are produced in a week. Since it works 6 days a week, and produces 800 units per day, the weekly production is 6 times 800, which is 4,800 units per week.\n\nNow, to find out how many weeks are needed to reach 10,000 units, we can divide 10,000 by 4,800. Let's see, 4,800 multiplied by 2 is 9,600, which is less than 10,000. So, it's more than 2 weeks.\n\nThe difference between 10,000 and 9,600 is 400 units. Since the factory produces 800 units per day, it would take half a day to produce 400 units.\n\nBut since factories typically operate in full days, we might need to consider that it takes an additional day to reach the 10,000 units.\n\nSo, in total, it would take 2 weeks and 1 day.\n\nBut let's cross-verify this with the earlier calculation of 12.5 days.\n\nSince the factory works 6 days a week, in 2 weeks it works 12 days. Plus one more day, totaling 13 days.\n\nBut earlier, we had 12.5 days. So, there might be a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of days needed without considering the weekly operation first.\n\nTotal units needed: 10,000\n\nUnits produced per day: 800\n\nTotal days required: 10,000 / 800 = 12.5 days.\n\nNow, since the factory operates 6 days a week, we need to find out how many weeks and extra days are in 12.5 days.\n\n6 days per week.\n\nSo, 12 days would be 2 weeks exactly (since 6 days/week * 2 weeks = 12 days).\n\nWe have an additional 0.5 day, but since the factory operates only 6 days a week, the 13th day would be the next operating day.\n\nTherefore, it would take 2 weeks and 1 day, which is a total of 13 days.\n\nBut in terms of weeks, it's 2 weeks and 1 day.\n\nHowever, if we need to express it in weeks, it would be 2 weeks plus 1/6 of a week (since 1 day is 1/6 of a week).\n\nSo, 2 + 1/6 weeks, which is approximately 2.167 weeks.\n\nBut the question might be expecting the answer in days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should consider the total production over the weeks.\n\nIn 2 weeks, producing 4,800 units per week, totals 9,600 units.\n\nRemaining units: 10,000 - 9,600 = 400 units.\n\nSince the factory produces 800 units per day, it can produce 400 units in half a day.\n\nBut since it's not practical to have half a day, we might need to round it up to a full day.\n\nTherefore, total time required is 2 weeks and 1 day.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider only operating days, then it's 13 days.\n\nBut the factory operates 6 days a week, so in 2 weeks, it's 12 days, plus 1 more day, totaling 13 days.\n\nSo, the answer is 13 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
