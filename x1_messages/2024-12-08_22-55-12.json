        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company sells a product for $50 per unit, and their fixed costs are $10,000 per month. The variable cost per unit is $30. I need to figure out how many units they need to sell each month to achieve a monthly profit of $5000. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the different costs involved. There are fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are those that don't change with the number of units produced or sold, like rent or salaries. In this case, it's $10,000 per month. Variable costs change with the level of production, like raw materials or direct labor. Here, it's $30 per unit.\n\nThe selling price per unit is $50. So, for each unit sold, the company earns $50, but it also incurs a $30 variable cost. That means the profit per unit is $50 minus $30, which is $20 per unit.\n\nNow, the company wants to achieve a monthly profit of $5000. But I have to remember that there are fixed costs of $10,000 that need to be covered before any profit is made. So, total costs include both fixed and variable costs.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s let x be the number of units sold.\n\nThe total revenue is then 50x (since each unit sells for $50).\n\nThe total variable costs are 30x (since each unit costs $30 to produce).\n\nThe total costs are the fixed costs plus the variable costs, which is 10,000 + 30x.\n\nProfit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. So, profit = 50x - (10,000 + 30x).\n\nSimplifying that, profit = 50x - 10,000 - 30x = 20x - 10,000.\n\nThe company wants profit to be $5000, so I set up the equation:\n\n20x - 10,000 = 5000.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x.\n\nAdding 10,000 to both sides:\n\n20x = 15,000.\n\nThen, dividing both sides by 20:\n\nx = 750.\n\nSo, the company needs to sell 750 units each month to achieve a monthly profit of $5000.\n\nBut let me double-check that.\n\nIf they sell 750 units:\n\nTotal revenue = 750 * 50 = $37,500.\n\nTotal variable costs = 750 * 30 = $22,500.\n\nTotal costs = fixed costs + variable costs = 10,000 + 22,500 = $32,500.\n\nProfit = revenue - total costs = 37,500 - 32,500 = $5,000.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about contribution margin. The contribution margin per unit is the selling price minus the variable cost per unit, which is $50 - $30 = $20, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThe break-even point is where total revenue equals total costs, so profit is zero.\n\nBreak-even point in units = fixed costs / contribution margin per unit = 10,000 / 20 = 500 units.\n\nTo achieve a profit of $5000, I need to sell enough additional units to generate $5000 in profit, given the contribution margin of $20 per unit.\n\nSo, additional units needed = desired profit / contribution margin per unit = 5000 / 20 = 250 units.\n\nTherefore, total units to sell = break-even units + additional units = 500 + 250 = 750 units.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the target profit formula:\n\nUnits to sell = (fixed costs + desired profit) / contribution margin per unit.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (10,000 + 5,000) / 20 = 15,000 / 20 = 750 units.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the company must sell 750 units each month to achieve a monthly profit of $5000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{750} \\]"
