        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a water tank. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere's a tank that can hold up to 500 gallons of water, and right now it has 300 gallons in it. There's a faucet connected to it that lets water out at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. The question is, how long will it take to empty the tank completely?\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to figure out how much water needs to be drained from the tank. Since it's currently holding 300 gallons and it needs to be empty, that means we need to remove all 300 gallons.\n\nThe faucet releases water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. So, to find out how many minutes it will take to release 300 gallons, I can divide the total amount of water by the rate at which it's being released.\n\nSo, time = total water / release rate\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\ntime = 300 gallons / 4 gallons per minute\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n300 divided by 4 is 75.\n\nSo, it should take 75 minutes to empty the tank.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf the faucet releases 4 gallons every minute, then in 75 minutes, it would release 4 gallons/minute * 75 minutes = 300 gallons. That matches the amount we need to drain.\n\nAlright, seems straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect the time.\n\nIs there any possibility that the release rate changes over time? The problem says the faucet releases water at a constant rate of 4 gallons per minute, so I don't think so.\n\nIs there any inflow of water into the tank while the faucet is releasing water? The problem doesn't mention any inflow, so I'll assume it's only being emptied.\n\nAlso, the tank's maximum capacity is 500 gallons, but since it's only holding 300 gallons to start with, and we're emptying it, the capacity doesn't directly affect the calculation. It's just providing additional information about the tank's size.\n\nSo, my final answer is 75 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]"
