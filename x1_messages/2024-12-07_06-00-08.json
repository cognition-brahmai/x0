        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a store that's offering a 20% discount on all items during a sale. A customer wants to buy an item that originally costs $75. We need to find out how much the customer will pay after the discount is applied and then after adding a 7% sales tax.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the discount. A 20% discount on $75 means the customer saves 20% of $75. To find 20% of 75, I can multiply 75 by 0.20.\n\nSo, discount = 75 * 0.20 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the price after the discount is original price minus discount: 75 - 15 = 60.\n\nNow, we need to apply a 7% sales tax on the discounted price. To find 7% of $60, I can multiply 60 by 0.07.\n\nSales tax = 60 * 0.07 = 4.2.\n\nFinally, the total amount the customer has to pay is the discounted price plus the sales tax: 60 + 4.2 = 64.2.\n\nSo, the customer will pay $64.20.\n\nBut let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, I get confused between applying percentages and multiplying decimals.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the final price directly by multiplying the original price by (1 - discount rate) and then by (1 + tax rate). Maybe I can try that method to verify my answer.\n\nSo, using that method:\n\nFinal price = original price * (1 - discount rate) * (1 + tax rate)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nFinal price = 75 * (1 - 0.20) * (1 + 0.07) = 75 * 0.80 * 1.07\n\nFirst, 75 * 0.80 = 60\n\nThen, 60 * 1.07 = 64.2\n\nYep, same answer as before. So, $64.20 is correct.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that sometimes sales tax is applied before the discount, or maybe it depends on the store's policy. Does it make a difference in the final price if the tax is applied before or after the discount?\n\nLet me consider the alternative: applying the tax before the discount.\n\nSo, first apply the 7% tax to the original price: 75 * 1.07 = 80.25\n\nThen apply the 20% discount on the taxed price: 80.25 * 0.20 = 16.05\n\nSubtract the discount from the taxed price: 80.25 - 16.05 = 64.20\n\nAgain, the same final price of $64.20.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, whether you apply the tax before or after the discount, the final price ends up being the same.\n\nI guess that makes sense because multiplication is commutative, meaning the order in which you multiply doesn't change the result.\n\nSo, in both cases, you're essentially multiplying the original price by (1 - discount rate) and then by (1 + tax rate), which gives the same result regardless of the order.\n\nTherefore, the customer will pay $64.20.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor that might affect the final price.\n\nIs there possibly a scenario where the discount and tax are applied differently?\n\nFor example, maybe the discount is applied to the price after tax, or maybe the tax is only applied to the discounted price.\n\nIn the United States, sales tax is usually applied to the discounted price, meaning the discount is applied first, then tax is added to the discounted price.\n\nThat's consistent with the first method I used.\n\nBut as I saw, even if you apply the tax first and then the discount, the final price remains the same.\n\nSo, regardless of the order, the customer ends up paying $64.20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $64.20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64.20} \\]"
