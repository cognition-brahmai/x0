        "content": "The sound that is often described as soothing for babies and can help them sleep is white noise. White noise is a constant, steady sound that can help mask other noises and create a calming environment. It's similar to the sounds babies hear in the womb, which can be comforting to them. There are various sources of white noise, such as fans, white noise machines, or even apps on smartphones and tablets that produce these sounds. Additionally, some parents find that lullabies, soft music, or gentle rocking motions also help soothe their babies to sleep."
