        "content": "Yes, a triangle with sides of length 7, 24, and 25 is a right triangle. To determine if a triangle is a right triangle, you can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the sides are 7, 24, and 25. Let's assume that 25 is the hypotenuse. We can check if 25\u00b2 = 7\u00b2 + 24\u00b2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n25\u00b2 = 625\n\n7\u00b2 = 49\n\n24\u00b2 = 576\n\nNow, add 49 and 576:\n\n49 + 576 = 625\n\nSince 625 = 625, the Pythagorean theorem holds true, confirming that the triangle is a right triangle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, it is a right triangle.}} \\]"
