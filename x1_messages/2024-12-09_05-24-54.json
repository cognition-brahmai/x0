        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 green marbles, 4 yellow marbles, and 6 blue marbles. So, total marbles in the bag are 5 + 4 + 6, which is 15 marbles. I need to find the probability of drawing exactly one marble of each color when I draw 3 marbles at random without replacement.\n\nOkay, so without replacement means once I draw a marble, it stays out and doesn't go back into the bag. That's important because it affects the probabilities for the next draws.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"exactly one marble of each color\" means. So, I need one green, one yellow, and one blue marble in my draw of three. Since I'm drawing three marbles and there are three colors, it makes sense that each marble is a different color.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I think I should use combinations because the order in which I draw the marbles doesn't matter. It's about the combination of colors I end up with.\n\nLet me recall the formula for combinations. The number of ways to choose k items from n items is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles out of 15. That would be C(15, 3).\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3!(15 - 3)!) = (15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 455.\n\nSo, there are 455 possible ways to draw 3 marbles from 15.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing one marble of each color.\n\nThere are 5 green marbles, 4 yellow marbles, and 6 blue marbles.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose one green marble is C(5, 1) = 5.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one yellow marble is C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one blue marble is C(6, 1) = 6.\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these individual choices.\n\nSo, favorable outcomes = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 120 / 455.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction. Both 120 and 455 are divisible by 5.\n\n120 \u00f7 5 = 24\n\n455 \u00f7 5 = 91\n\nSo, 24/91.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal ways to draw 3 marbles: C(15, 3) = 455. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of ways to draw one of each color: C(5,1) \u00d7 C(4,1) \u00d7 C(6,1) = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 = 120. That also seems right.\n\nSo, probability is 120 / 455 = 24 / 91.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the different orders in which I can draw the marbles. For example, green first, then yellow, then blue, or any other order.\n\nLet's calculate it that way and see if I get the same answer.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a green marble first is 5/15.\n\nThen, given that a green marble has been drawn, the probability of drawing a yellow marble next is 4/14.\n\nThen, given that a green and a yellow have been drawn, the probability of drawing a blue marble next is 6/13.\n\nSo, the probability of this specific sequence (green, yellow, blue) is (5/15) \u00d7 (4/14) \u00d7 (6/13).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(5/15) = 1/3\n\n(4/14) = 2/7\n\n(6/13) = 6/13\n\nSo, (1/3) \u00d7 (2/7) \u00d7 (6/13) = (1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13) = 12 / 273.\n\nSimilarly, there are other sequences: green, blue, yellow; yellow, green, blue; yellow, blue, green; blue, green, yellow; blue, yellow, green.\n\nEach of these sequences will have the same probability because the numbers are just rearranged in the multiplication, but multiplication is commutative.\n\nSo, since there are 6 different sequences (which makes sense because 3! = 6), the total probability is 6 \u00d7 (12 / 273) = 72 / 273.\n\nSimplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3.\n\n72 \u00f7 3 = 24\n\n273 \u00f7 3 = 91\n\nSo, 24 / 91.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 24/91.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some probability problems, especially with multiple colors or categories, there might be another way to approach it, like using probabilities of not selecting certain items, but in this case, since we need exactly one of each, the approach I used seems appropriate.\n\nLet me consider if there's any overlap or if I've double-counted anything.\n\nIn the first method, using combinations, I calculated the number of ways to choose one marble of each color and divided by the total number of ways to choose any three marbles.\n\nIn the second method, I considered the probability of each sequence and multiplied by the number of sequences.\n\nBoth methods gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that 24/91 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of conditional probability, but that might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\nLet me see: total marbles 15, need to choose 3.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one green, one yellow, and one blue is indeed 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nTotal ways to choose any 3 marbles is C(15, 3) = 455.\n\nSo, probability is 120 / 455 = 24 / 91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning, so I think 24/91 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{91}} \\]"
