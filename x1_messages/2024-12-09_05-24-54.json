        "content": "Oh, I think I know this one! So, you're talking about a country in Asia that's still big and has a lot of people, even though it lost some land in the west. And it's a federal republic where most people practice Buddhism. It's called the \"People's Republic\" of something. Let me think...\n\nI remember that there are a few countries in Asia that are called \"People's Republic,\" but not all of them have Buddhism as the main religion. For example, there's the People's Republic of China, but China is mostly Buddhist in some parts, but also has a lot of other religions like Taoism and Confucianism. But I'm not sure if that's the one you're thinking of.\n\nWait, maybe it's the People's Republic of Bangladesh? No, I don't think Buddhism is the main religion there. Bangladesh is mostly Muslim, right? So that probably isn't it.\n\nLet's see, another one is the People's Republic of Bangladesh\u2014wait, that can't be right because I just thought of Bangladesh. Maybe it's the People's Republic of Bhutan? Bhutan is in Asia, and I think Buddhism is important there. But is it a federal republic? And is it highly populated? Hmm, Bhutan is small, isn't it?\n\nOr perhaps the People's Republic of Sri Lanka? Sri Lanka is in Asia, has a large Buddhist population, and it's a republic. But has it lost western territories recently? I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's the People's Republic of Myanmar? Myanmar is in Asia, has a large Buddhist population, and it's a republic. And I've heard about some territorial issues there, especially with the Rohingya crisis in the west. Could that be it?\n\nLet me check. Myanmar, also known as Burma, is a country in Southeast Asia. It's majority Buddhist, and it is a federal republic. Recently, there have been issues in the western part of the country, particularly in Rakhine State, where there's been conflict leading to displacement of people. So, it's possible that it has lost some control over western territories due to these conflicts.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"losing western territories\" is the exact term. Maybe it's more about loss of control or humanitarian crises in those areas. Still, compared to other options, Myanmar seems to fit the description better.\n\nAlternatively, could it be the People's Republic of Nepal? Nepal is in South Asia, between China and India, and it has a significant Buddhist population, especially in the Himalayan regions. It's also a federal republic. But I don't recall hearing about it losing western territories recently.\n\nOr maybe the People's Republic of Kashmir? Wait, Kashmir is a disputed territory between India and Pakistan, and it has a significant Buddhist population in Ladakh. But I don't think it's officially called the People's Republic of Kashmir.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think differently. You said it's a federal republic with Buddhism as the most common religion, and it's lost some western territories. Given that, I'm going to guess that it's Myanmar.\n\nSo, my answer is: Myanmar.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Myanmar}} \\]"
