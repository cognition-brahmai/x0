        "content": "Let's see. The farmer has a rectangular field that's 200 meters long and 150 meters wide. He wants to plant trees around the perimeter, with each tree 10 meters apart. I need to figure out how many trees he'll need.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the perimeter of the field since the trees are going around the edge. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). So, plugging in the values:\n\nP = 2*(200 + 150) = 2*(350) = 700 meters.\n\nThat's the total distance around the field.\n\nNow, if trees are planted 10 meters apart, I can find out how many trees are needed by dividing the perimeter by the distance between each tree.\n\nNumber of trees = Perimeter / Distance between trees = 700 / 10 = 70 trees.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that when placing items at regular intervals around a closed shape, like a rectangle, you have to consider that the first and last tree will be at the same point, essentially closing the loop. So, in that case, the number of trees should be equal to the perimeter divided by the interval.\n\nBut let's double-check this. If I imagine starting at one corner and planting a tree every 10 meters, by the time I get back to the starting point, the distance should be exactly divisible by 10 meters.\n\nLet me think about a smaller example to verify. Suppose the field was 10 meters by 10 meters, so the perimeter would be 40 meters. If trees are planted every 10 meters, you would have trees at 0m, 10m, 20m, 30m, and back to 0m, which is the starting point. So that's 4 trees in total, which matches 40 / 10 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, 700 / 10 = 70 trees should be correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the arrangement along each side.\n\nStarting with the length: 200 meters, trees every 10 meters. So, number of trees along one length would be 200 / 10 = 20 trees. But wait, that counts both endpoints, but the endpoints are shared with the widths.\n\nSimilarly, for the width: 150 meters, trees every 10 meters. That would be 150 / 10 = 15 trees per width.\n\nNow, for the entire perimeter:\n\n- Two lengths: 2 * 20 = 40 trees\n\n- Two widths: 2 * 15 = 30 trees\n\n- Total: 40 + 30 = 70 trees\n\nBut in this counting, the corner trees are counted twice, once for each side they're on. Since each corner tree is shared by two sides, we've double-counted them.\n\nSo, how many corner trees are there? Four, one at each corner.\n\nTherefore, we need to subtract the four corner trees that were double-counted.\n\nSo, corrected total: 70 - 4 = 66 trees.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 70 trees. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me try to think differently. If I consider the perimeter as a closed loop of 700 meters, and trees are planted every 10 meters, then the number of trees should be equal to the perimeter divided by the interval, which is 700 / 10 = 70 trees.\n\nHowever, when I think about the sides separately, and consider that the corner trees are shared, it seems like 70 trees is the correct count without subtracting anything, because the corner trees are part of both sides anyway.\n\nMaybe I'm getting confused. Let's try another approach.\n\nImagine starting at one corner and planting trees every 10 meters around the perimeter.\n\n- Along the first length (200 meters): trees at 0m, 10m, 20m, ..., 200m. That's 21 trees (including both endpoints).\n\n- Along the first width (150 meters): trees at 200m, 210m, ..., 350m. That's 16 trees, but the tree at 200m is already counted in the first length.\n\n- Along the second length (200 meters): trees at 350m, 360m, ..., 550m. That's 21 trees, but the tree at 350m is already counted in the first width.\n\n- Along the second width (150 meters): trees at 550m, 560m, ..., 700m. That's 16 trees, but the tree at 700m is the same as the starting tree at 0m.\n\nNow, let's add them up carefully, accounting for overlapping trees:\n\n- First length: 21 trees\n\n- First width: 16 trees, but one is already counted in the first length, so +15\n\n- Second length: 21 trees, but one is already counted in the first width, so +20\n\n- Second width: 16 trees, but one is already counted in the second length, so +15\n\nTotal: 21 + 15 + 20 + 15 = 71 trees\n\nWait, that can't be right because 71 doesn't match my earlier calculation of 70.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm still double-counting somewhere.\n\nLet me try a different method.\n\nIf the perimeter is 700 meters and trees are every 10 meters, it's like dividing the perimeter into 70 segments of 10 meters each. Since it's a closed loop, the number of trees should be equal to the number of segments, which is 70.\n\nBut according to my previous approach, I got 71 trees, which doesn't make sense because 700 / 10 should be 70.\n\nI think the confusion arises from how we count the starting tree.\n\nIn the closed loop, the first tree and the last tree coincide, so we shouldn't count the starting tree again at the end.\n\nSo, in the earlier addition, when I added trees along each side, including overlapping ones, I might have counted the starting tree twice.\n\nLet me adjust that.\n\n- First length: 21 trees\n\n- First width: 16 trees, but the first tree is the same as the last tree of the first length, so +15\n\n- Second length: 21 trees, but the first tree is the same as the last tree of the first width, so +20\n\n- Second width: 16 trees, but the first tree is the same as the last tree of the second length, and the last tree is the same as the starting tree, so +15\n\nTotal: 21 + 15 + 20 + 15 = 71 trees\n\nHmm, still 71. That doesn't match the 70 from perimeter divided by interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to subtract the overlapping trees properly.\n\nTotal trees without considering overlaps: 2*(20 + 15) = 2*35 = 70 trees.\n\nBut since the corners are shared, we've counted each corner tree in two sides, so we need to subtract the four corner trees that were double-counted.\n\nTherefore, 70 - 4 = 66 trees.\n\nBut earlier, dividing the perimeter by the interval gives 70 trees.\n\nNow I'm really confused.\n\nLet me look up how to calculate the number of objects placed at regular intervals around a closed path.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that for a closed path, the number of objects is equal to the perimeter divided by the interval between them.\n\nSo, in this case, 700 / 10 = 70 trees.\n\nBut according to my side-by-side calculation, it's 66 trees.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, and I need to resolve it.\n\nLet me try to visualize a smaller example.\n\nSuppose the field is 10m by 10m, perimeter 40m, trees every 10m.\n\nUsing the perimeter method: 40 / 10 = 4 trees.\n\nUsing the side-by-side method:\n\n- Length: 10m, trees at 0m and 10m (2 trees)\n\n- Width: 10m, trees at 10m and 20m (2 trees)\n\n- Length: 10m, trees at 20m and 30m (2 trees)\n\n- Width: 10m, trees at 30m and 40m (2 trees)\n\nBut 40m is the same as 0m, so trees at 0m, 10m, 20m, 30m, 40m, which would be 5 trees, but that can't be right because it should be a closed loop of 4 trees.\n\nWait, the issue is that in the side-by-side method, I'm counting the corner trees multiple times.\n\nSo, to correct this, I need to ensure that corner trees are only counted once.\n\nSo, for the 10m x 10m field:\n\n- Starting at 0m, plant a tree.\n\n- Move 10m to 10m, plant a tree.\n\n- Move 10m to 20m, plant a tree.\n\n- Move 10m to 30m, plant a tree.\n\n- Move 10m to 40m, which is back to 0m, so no new tree is planted.\n\nTotal trees: 4.\n\nThat matches the perimeter method.\n\nApplying this to the original problem:\n\n- Start at 0m, plant a tree.\n\n- Move 10m, plant a tree at 10m.\n\n- Continue until 690m, plant a tree.\n\n- Next would be at 700m, which is back to 0m, so no new tree.\n\nTotal trees: 700 / 10 = 70 trees.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs 70 trees.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried the side-by-side method, I got 66 trees, which is incorrect.\n\nI see where I went wrong in the side-by-side method.\n\nWhen calculating trees along each side, I need to exclude the corner trees from one side when they are already counted in another side.\n\nSo, for the lengths:\n\n- Each length has trees at 0m and 200m, but these are corners and should only be counted once.\n\n- So, for one length, number of new trees is (200 / 10) - 1 = 19 trees, plus the corner tree.\n\nWait, better to think of it as:\n\n- Number of trees along one length, excluding the corner trees, is (200 / 10) - 1 = 19 trees.\n\n- Similarly, for one width, excluding the corner trees, is (150 / 10) - 1 = 14 trees.\n\n- Then, total trees are:\n\n- Two lengths: 2 * 19 = 38 trees\n\n- Two widths: 2 * 14 = 28 trees\n\n- Plus the four corner trees\n\n- Total: 38 + 28 + 4 = 70 trees\n\nAh, that matches the perimeter method.\n\nSo, the correct number of trees is 70.\n\nEarlier, I mistakenly included the corner trees in the count for each side without adjusting for overlaps.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to plant 70 trees around the perimeter of his field, with each tree 10 meters apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
