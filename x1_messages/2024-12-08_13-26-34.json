        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have packs of different fruits: apples come in packs of 6, oranges in packs of 8, and bananas in packs of 4. The person wants to buy an equal number of packs for each fruit. We need to find out the minimum number of fruits they can buy in total.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means to buy an equal number of packs for each fruit. Let's say the person buys 'n' packs of each fruit. So, they buy 'n' packs of apples, 'n' packs of oranges, and 'n' packs of bananas.\n\nNow, each pack of apples has 6 apples, so 'n' packs of apples will have 6n apples.\n\nSimilarly, each pack of oranges has 8 oranges, so 'n' packs of oranges will have 8n oranges.\n\nEach pack of bananas has 4 bananas, so 'n' packs of bananas will have 4n bananas.\n\nThe total number of fruits will be the sum of apples, oranges, and bananas: 6n + 8n + 4n.\n\nLet's simplify that: 6n + 8n + 4n = 18n.\n\nSo, the total number of fruits is 18n.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of fruits, which would correspond to the smallest possible value of 'n'. Since 'n' represents the number of packs, and you can't buy a fraction of a pack, 'n' has to be a positive integer, starting from 1.\n\nSo, if n = 1:\n\nTotal fruits = 18 * 1 = 18.\n\nWait a minute, is that really the minimum?\n\nLet's check if there's a smaller total by considering that maybe the packs could be bought in such a way that the number of fruits per type aligns in a way that reduces the total.\n\nBut the problem states that an equal number of packs of each fruit must be bought, so n has to be the same for all.\n\nTherefore, the minimum occurs when n is as small as possible, which is 1.\n\nSo, the minimum number of fruits they can buy is 18.\n\nBut let's double-check this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find a common multiple or something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the pack sizes to minimize the total fruits.\n\nLet's think about it differently.\n\nIf we consider the number of fruits per pack:\n\n- Apples: 6 per pack\n\n- Oranges: 8 per pack\n\n- Bananas: 4 per pack\n\nAnd we're buying n packs of each.\n\nTotal fruits = 6n + 8n + 4n = 18n.\n\nTo minimize the total number of fruits, we need the smallest n that satisfies the condition of buying an equal number of packs of each fruit.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest n is 1, leading to 18 fruits.\n\nAlternatively, if n=2, total fruits=36, which is more.\n\nSo, 18 is indeed the minimum.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to buy fewer fruits by buying different numbers of packs, but the problem specifically says an equal number of packs of each fruit, so that approach won't work.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find the smallest total number of fruits that is a multiple of the sum of the pack sizes, given that the number of packs for each fruit is the same.\n\nIn other words, total fruits = n*(6 + 8 + 4) = 18n.\n\nThe smallest positive integer value for n is 1, giving 18 fruits.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of fruits they can buy is 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
