        "content": "The theory that suggests human behavior is primarily driven by unconscious desires and conflicts is Psychoanalytic Theory. This theory was developed by Sigmund Freud and focuses on the role of the unconscious mind in shaping behavior. Freud believed that many of our actions and thoughts are influenced by unconscious motivations and conflicts that we are not aware of. He proposed that these unconscious desires and conflicts can manifest themselves in various ways, such as through dreams, slips of the tongue, and neurotic symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is E. Psychoanalytic Theory."
