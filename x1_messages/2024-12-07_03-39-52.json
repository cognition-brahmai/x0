        "content": "So I have this problem: Let A be an n x n matrix. Prove that if A squared equals A, then A is diagonalizable. Okay, first things first, I need to recall what it means for a matrix to be diagonalizable.\n\nA matrix A is diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix P such that P inverse times A times P is a diagonal matrix. In other words, A can be expressed as PDP inverse, where D is a diagonal matrix.\n\nAlright, so given that A squared equals A, which means A times A equals A. That seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can think about the minimal polynomial of A. The minimal polynomial is the monic polynomial of least degree that annihilates A, meaning when you plug A into the polynomial, you get the zero matrix.\n\nGiven that A squared equals A, that suggests that A satisfies the polynomial equation x squared minus x equals zero. So, the minimal polynomial of A divides x squared minus x. Since x squared minus x factors into x(x - 1), the minimal polynomial could be either x, (x - 1), or x(x - 1).\n\nWait a minute, but if the minimal polynomial is x, that would mean A is the zero matrix, and if it's (x - 1), then A is the identity matrix. Both of these are diagonal matrices, which are certainly diagonalizable. So, in these cases, A is diagonalizable.\n\nBut what if the minimal polynomial is x(x - 1)? That would mean A is not the zero matrix nor the identity matrix, but it still satisfies A squared equals A. I need to show that in this case, A is also diagonalizable.\n\nI recall that a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial factors into distinct linear factors. Hmm, in this case, x(x - 1) is indeed a product of distinct linear factors: x and (x - 1).\n\nSo, if the minimal polynomial of A is x(x - 1), which is a product of distinct linear factors, then A is diagonalizable.\n\nWait, is that a theorem or something? Let me think back. Yeah, I think there's a theorem that says a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial splits into distinct linear factors over the field we're working with, which in this case is probably the real numbers or complex numbers.\n\nSo, in this problem, since A satisfies x squared minus x equals zero, its minimal polynomial divides x(x - 1), which splits into distinct linear factors. Therefore, A is diagonalizable.\n\nBut maybe I should think about this in another way to confirm. Let's consider the eigenvalues of A. If A squared equals A, what can I say about its eigenvalues?\n\nSuppose lambda is an eigenvalue of A, with eigenvector v, so A.v equals lambda.v. Then, A squared.v equals A.(A.v) equals A.(lambda.v) equals lambda.(A.v) equals lambda.(lambda.v) equals lambda squared.v.\n\nBut since A squared equals A, A squared.v equals A.v, so lambda squared.v equals lambda.v. Assuming v is not the zero vector, we can divide both sides by v, which gives lambda squared equals lambda.\n\nSo, lambda squared minus lambda equals zero, which means lambda(lambda - 1) equals zero. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A are either 0 or 1.\n\nThat's interesting. So, the only possible eigenvalues are 0 and 1.\n\nNow, for A to be diagonalizable, the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue must equal its geometric multiplicity. In other words, for each eigenvalue, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial should equal the dimension of its eigenspace.\n\nSo, let's consider the eigenvalues 0 and 1.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the algebraic multiplicity of eigenvalue 0 as m0 and of eigenvalue 1 as m1. Similarly, the geometric multiplicities are g0 and g1.\n\nWe need to show that m0 equals g0 and m1 equals g1.\n\nAlternatively, since A is an n x n matrix, and the sum of the algebraic multiplicities should be n (m0 + m1 = n), and the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces should also be n if A is diagonalizable.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the eigenspaces.\n\nGiven that A squared equals A, A is a projection matrix. Projection matrices have eigenvalues 0 and 1, and they are diagonalizable.\n\nBut let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 1, which is the set of all vectors v such that A.v equals 1.v, which is v. So, this is the set of all vectors that are fixed by A, which is the column space of A, since A.v equals v means v is in the column space of A.\n\nSimilarly, the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is the set of all vectors v such that A.v equals 0, which is the null space of A.\n\nSo, the eigenspace for eigenvalue 1 is the column space of A, and the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the null space of A.\n\nNow, from linear algebra, we know that for any matrix A, the column space and the null space are complementary subspaces. In other words, the direct sum of the column space and the null space is the entire vector space.\n\nMoreover, the dimension of the column space is the rank of A, and the dimension of the null space is the nullity of A. By the rank-nullity theorem, rank(A) + nullity(A) equals n, the number of columns.\n\nSo, the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces is rank(A) + nullity(A) = n.\n\nSince the eigenspaces correspond to the eigenvalues 0 and 1, and their dimensions add up to n, and there are no other eigenvalues, this suggests that A is diagonalizable.\n\nBecause, in a diagonalizable matrix, the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces should equal the dimension of the vector space, which is n.\n\nTherefore, A is diagonalizable.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the Jordan canonical form. Since A satisfies its minimal polynomial, which divides x(x - 1), and x(x - 1) has no repeated roots, the Jordan blocks corresponding to each eigenvalue are 1x1 blocks, meaning A is similar to a diagonal matrix.\n\nWait, but I think this is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe I should stick with the eigenspace approach.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nGiven A squared equals A, we have that A is a projection matrix.\n\nThe eigenvalues of A are 0 and 1.\n\nThe eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 1 is the column space of A.\n\nThe eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is the null space of A.\n\nBy the rank-nullity theorem, the dimensions of these eigenspaces add up to n.\n\nTherefore, A is diagonalizable.\n\nI think that's a solid proof.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{A is diagonalizable}}"
