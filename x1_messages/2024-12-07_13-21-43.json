        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a class of 30 students, and we know that 18 play basketball, 20 play soccer, and 4 don't play either sport. We need to find out how many students play both basketball and soccer.\n\nFirst, I think it's helpful to visualize this with a Venn diagram. Imagine two circles overlapping: one circle for basketball players and another for soccer players. The overlapping area represents students who play both sports.\n\nSo, the total number of students who play at least one sport is 30 - 4 = 26 students, since 4 students don't play either.\n\nNow, if we add the number of basketball players and soccer players, that's 18 + 20 = 38. But wait, that's more than the total number of students who play at least one sport (26). That means some students are being counted twice because they play both sports.\n\nTo find out how many are counted twice, we can subtract the total number of students who play at least one sport from the sum of basketball and soccer players: 38 - 26 = 12.\n\nSo, 12 students are counted in both the basketball and soccer groups, meaning they play both sports.\n\nLet me double-check that. If 18 play basketball and 20 play soccer, and 12 play both, then the number of students who play only basketball is 18 - 12 = 6, and only soccer is 20 - 12 = 8. Adding those up: 6 (only basketball) + 8 (only soccer) + 12 (both) = 26, which matches the number of students who play at least one sport. And adding the 4 who don't play any sports, we get 30, which is the total number of students. So, it checks out.\n\nTherefore, the number of students who play both basketball and soccer is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
