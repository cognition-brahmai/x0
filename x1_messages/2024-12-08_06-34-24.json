        "content": "In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, there are 12 face cards (Jack, Queen, King of each suit) and 26 red cards (all hearts and diamonds). However, there are 6 cards that are both red and face cards (the Jack, Queen, and King of hearts and diamonds). To find the probability of drawing a face card or a red card, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of drawing a face card:\n\nP(face card) = number of face cards / total number of cards = 12/52 \u2248 0.2308 or 23.08%\n\nNext, calculate the probability of drawing a red card:\n\nP(red card) = number of red cards / total number of cards = 26/52 = 0.5 or 50%\n\nNow, calculate the probability of drawing a card that is both a face card and a red card:\n\nP(face and red) = number of red face cards / total number of cards = 6/52 \u2248 0.1154 or 11.54%\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the probability of drawing a face card or a red card is:\n\nP(face or red) = P(face card) + P(red card) - P(face and red) \u2248 0.2308 + 0.5 - 0.1154 \u2248 0.6154 or 61.54%\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 61.54%."
