        "content": "Sure, here are the invention processes of four household appliances, along with their inventors and the years they were invented:\n\n- **Refrigerator:**\n\n- Invented by Carl von Linde in 1876.\n\n- Von Linde was a German engineer who developed the first reliable compression refrigeration machine.\n\n- His invention was based on the principle of expanding compressed gas to create a cooling effect.\n\n- The refrigerator revolutionized food preservation by allowing for longer storage times and reducing food waste.\n\n- **Vacuum cleaner:**\n\n- Invented by Hubert Cecil Booth in 1901.\n\n- Booth was inspired by seeing a demonstration of compressed air used to clean railway carriages.\n\n- He developed the first powered vacuum cleaner, which used a gasoline engine to power a vacuum pump.\n\n- The machine was large and had to be parked outside the building being cleaned, with hoses fed through the windows.\n\n- **Washing machine:**\n\n- Invented by Alva J. Fisher in 1908.\n\n- Fisher was an American inventor who developed the Thor, the first electric washing machine.\n\n- The Thor used an electric motor to agitate the clothes in soapy water, making the washing process faster and easier.\n\n- Prior to this, washing machines were hand-operated or used water power.\n\n- **Microwave oven:**\n\n- Invented by Percy Spencer in 1945.\n\n- Spencer was an American engineer working for Raytheon Corporation.\n\n- He discovered that microwaves from a radar tube could heat food when a chocolate bar in his pocket melted.\n\n- This led him to develop the first microwave oven, called the Radarange, which was introduced in 1947.\n\n- The microwave oven revolutionized cooking by allowing food to be heated quickly and efficiently.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
