        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a box with 6 red marbles, 4 blue marbles, and 5 green marbles. So total, there are 6 + 4 + 5 = 15 marbles in the box. The problem is about drawing three marbles at random without replacement, and we need to find the probability that exactly two of those marbles are red.\n\nOkay, so without replacement means that once we draw a marble, it stays out and doesn't go back into the box. That affects the probabilities for the subsequent draws.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the total number of possible outcomes is when drawing three marbles from 15. Since the order doesn't matter here (we're just interested in the colors, not the order in which they're drawn), this is a combination problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of 15 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nSo, total number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 15 is:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15!}{3!(15 - 3)!} = \\frac{15!}{3! \\cdot 12!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 455\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 455 possible combinations of 3 marbles from the box.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to draw exactly two red marbles. Since there are 6 red marbles, the number of ways to choose 2 red marbles out of 6 is:\n\n\\[\nC(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6 - 2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2! \\cdot 4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to choose 2 red marbles.\n\nBut we need to draw three marbles in total, and exactly two of them are red. That means the third marble must be not red. In other words, it must be either blue or green.\n\nThere are 4 blue and 5 green marbles, so total non-red marbles are 4 + 5 = 9.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 1 non-red marble out of 9 is:\n\n\\[\nC(9, 1) = \\frac{9!}{1!(9 - 1)!} = \\frac{9!}{1! \\cdot 8!} = \\frac{9}{1} = 9\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing exactly two red marbles and one non-red marble, is the product of the two combinations:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 9 = 135\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 135 favorable ways to draw exactly two red marbles and one non-red marble.\n\nNow, to find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly two red}) = \\frac{135}{455}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{135 \\div 5}{455 \\div 5} = \\frac{27}{91}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{27}{91} \\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can also approach this problem step by step, considering the draws one by one, to see if I get the same answer.\n\nAlright, let's consider the draws sequentially, without replacement.\n\nWe want exactly two red marbles in three draws. There are different sequences in which this can happen:\n\n1. Red, Red, Non-Red\n\n2. Red, Non-Red, Red\n\n3. Non-Red, Red, Red\n\nSo, three possible sequences.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each sequence and then add them up.\n\nFirst sequence: Red, Red, Non-Red.\n\n- Probability of first marble being red: \\( \\frac{6}{15} \\) (since there are 6 red out of 15 total).\n\n- After drawing one red, there are now 5 red marbles left and total marbles are 14.\n\n- Probability of second marble being red: \\( \\frac{5}{14} \\).\n\n- Now, for the third marble, it should be non-red. There are 9 non-red marbles left out of 13 total marbles.\n\n- Probability of third marble being non-red: \\( \\frac{9}{13} \\).\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{15} \\times \\frac{5}{14} \\times \\frac{9}{13}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the second sequence: Red, Non-Red, Red.\n\n- First marble: red, \\( \\frac{6}{15} \\).\n\n- Second marble: non-red, \\( \\frac{9}{14} \\) (since one red is already drawn, total marbles are now 14, and non-red remains 9).\n\n- Third marble: red, \\( \\frac{5}{13} \\).\n\nSo, probability for this sequence is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{15} \\times \\frac{9}{14} \\times \\frac{5}{13}\n\\]\n\nThird sequence: Non-Red, Red, Red.\n\n- First marble: non-red, \\( \\frac{9}{15} \\).\n\n- Second marble: red, \\( \\frac{6}{14} \\) (since one non-red is already drawn, total marbles are now 14, and red remains 6).\n\n- Third marble: red, \\( \\frac{5}{13} \\).\n\nProbability for this sequence:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{15} \\times \\frac{6}{14} \\times \\frac{5}{13}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate each of these probabilities.\n\nFirst sequence:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{15} \\times \\frac{5}{14} \\times \\frac{9}{13} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 9}{15 \\times 14 \\times 13} = \\frac{270}{2730}\n\\]\n\nSecond sequence:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{15} \\times \\frac{9}{14} \\times \\frac{5}{13} = \\frac{6 \\times 9 \\times 5}{15 \\times 14 \\times 13} = \\frac{270}{2730}\n\\]\n\nThird sequence:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{15} \\times \\frac{6}{14} \\times \\frac{5}{13} = \\frac{9 \\times 6 \\times 5}{15 \\times 14 \\times 13} = \\frac{270}{2730}\n\\]\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{270}{2730} + \\frac{270}{2730} + \\frac{270}{2730} = \\frac{810}{2730}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 30:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{810 \\div 30}{2730 \\div 30} = \\frac{27}{91}\n\\]\n\nSo, again, we get the probability as \\( \\frac{27}{91} \\).\n\nThis matches the answer I got from the combination approach earlier. So, that's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of conditional probability, but I think the combination approach and the sequential approach are sufficient for this problem.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to use the formula for hypergeometric distribution, since we're drawing without replacement from a finite population.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\frac{C(K, k) \\times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the population size (total marbles: 15)\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (red marbles: 6)\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of draws (3)\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (2 red marbles)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\frac{C(6, 2) \\times C(15 - 6, 3 - 2)}{C(15, 3)} = \\frac{C(6, 2) \\times C(9, 1)}{C(15, 3)} = \\frac{15 \\times 9}{455} = \\frac{135}{455} = \\frac{27}{91}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting \\( \\frac{27}{91} \\) as the probability.\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{27}{91}} \\]"
