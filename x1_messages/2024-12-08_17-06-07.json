        "content": "The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, for a garden that's 25 feet long and 15 feet wide, the area would be 25 times 15. Let me do the math here.\n\n25 multiplied by 15. Well, 25 times 10 is 250, and 25 times 5 is 125. Adding those together, 250 plus 125 equals 375. So, the area of the garden is 375 square feet.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to calculate it. I could think of it as 15 times 25. 15 times 20 is 300, and 15 times 5 is 75. Adding those gives me 375 again. Yep, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width, so A = l * w. Plugging in the values, A = 25 ft * 15 ft = 375 square feet.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect the area calculation, like units or anything. The measurements are both in feet, so multiplying them directly gives square feet, which is the correct unit for area.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the shape is indeed a rectangle. The problem says it's a rectangular garden, so that's fine. If it were another shape, like a circle or a triangle, the formula would be different, but for a rectangle, length times width is definitely the way to go.\n\nIs there any chance that the dimensions could be different? Like, maybe the width is actually 15 feet everywhere, or if the garden is irregularly shaped. But the problem specifies that it's rectangular, so all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. Therefore, the area calculation should be straightforward.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I imagine a garden that is 25 feet long and 15 feet wide, it's like having 25 rows of 15 feet each. So, adding up all those feet would give me the total area.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that one square foot is a square that is one foot on each side. So, in this garden, there are 375 of those squares. That makes sense.\n\nJust to be extra sure, perhaps I can use a different method to calculate the area. Let's say I break down the garden into smaller rectangles. For example, I could think of it as a 20 ft by 15 ft rectangle plus a 5 ft by 15 ft rectangle. The area of the first rectangle would be 20 * 15 = 300 square feet, and the area of the second would be 5 * 15 = 75 square feet. Adding them together gives 375 square feet again.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for the area of a parallelogram, which is base times height, but since it's a rectangle, the height is the same as the width, so it's still 25 * 15 = 375.\n\nI could also consider that area is additive, so if I were to divide the garden into any number of parts and add their areas, I should still get the total area of 375 square feet.\n\nIs there any possibility that the garden has areas that are not part of the rectangular shape, like a pond or a path? The problem doesn't mention any such features, so I assume the entire area is the garden.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any borders or boundaries that might affect the measurement, but again, the problem doesn't specify anything like that, so I'll assume the given dimensions are for the entire garden area.\n\nJust for kicks, maybe I can try to calculate the perimeter as well, even though it's not asked for. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width, so 2*25 + 2*15 = 50 + 30 = 80 feet. That's interesting, but not relevant to the area.\n\nComing back, I think I've confirmed in multiple ways that the area is indeed 375 square feet. I can't think of any other factors that would change this calculation based on the information provided.\n\nSo, the final answer is 375 square feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]"
