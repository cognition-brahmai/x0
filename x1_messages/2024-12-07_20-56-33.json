        "content": "So there's this box with balls in it\u20146 red ones and 4 blue ones. I need to figure out the chance of picking a red ball if I grab one at random. Hmm, probability stuff. I remember that probability is like, how likely something is to happen, and it's usually a fraction or a decimal between 0 and 1, where 0 means it'll never happen and 1 means it's certain.\n\nSo, first things first, I need to know the total number of balls in the box. There are 6 red and 4 blue, so total balls are 6 + 4, which is 10. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, probability of picking a red ball should be the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, that would be 6 red balls divided by 10 total balls. So, 6/10.\n\nI can simplify that fraction. 6 divided by 2 is 3, and 10 divided by 2 is 5, so it's 3/5. Alternatively, 6 divided by 10 is 0.6, which is the decimal form.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/5 or 0.6. I think that's it. But just to be sure, maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider each ball having an equal chance of being picked. Since there are 10 balls, each ball has a 1/10 chance of being selected. Since there are 6 red balls, the probability of picking a red one would be 6 times 1/10, which is 6/10 or 0.6 again. So, that matches my first approach.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider here? Like, is the picking random? The question says \"randomly pick one ball,\" so I think it's safe to assume that each ball has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nIs there any chance that the balls are not equally likely to be picked? Maybe if some balls are heavier or smaller, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So, I'll stick with the assumption that each ball has an equal chance.\n\nAlso, the colors are only red and blue, so no other colors to consider. That makes it straightforward, just two outcomes: red or blue.\n\nSo, probability of red is 3/5 or 0.6, which is 60%. So, there's a 60% chance that I'll pick a red ball.\n\nI think that's the answer. But to be thorough, maybe I should consider the probability of picking a blue ball and see if everything adds up.\n\nIf there are 4 blue balls out of 10, the probability of picking a blue ball would be 4/10, which is 0.4 or 40%. So, probabilities: red = 0.6, blue = 0.4. And if I add them up, 0.6 + 0.4 = 1, which makes sense because these are the only two outcomes possible.\n\nSo, everything checks out. I'm confident with the answer now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.6} \\]"
