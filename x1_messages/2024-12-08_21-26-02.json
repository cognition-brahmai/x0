        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bakery that sells cupcakes for $2 each and cookies for $1 each. Jane spent a total of $20 on a combination of these two items, and she bought more cupcakes than cookies. We need to find out the minimum number of cupcakes she could have purchased.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of cupcakes.\n\n- Let \\( k \\) represent the number of cookies.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total cost of cupcakes and cookies is $20.\n\n2. The number of cupcakes is greater than the number of cookies.\n\nIn terms of equations and inequalities, this translates to:\n\n1. \\( 2c + k = 20 \\) (since cupcakes are $2 each and cookies are $1 each).\n\n2. \\( c > k \\) (since she bought more cupcakes than cookies).\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible value of \\( c \\) that satisfies both of these conditions.\n\nTo approach this, I think I'll try to express one variable in terms of the other using the first equation, and then apply the inequality.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\( 2c + k = 20 \\)\n\nI can solve for \\( k \\):\n\n\\( k = 20 - 2c \\)\n\nNow, plug this expression for \\( k \\) into the inequality \\( c > k \\):\n\n\\( c > 20 - 2c \\)\n\nLet's solve this inequality for \\( c \\):\n\nAdd \\( 2c \\) to both sides:\n\n\\( c + 2c > 20 \\)\n\n\\( 3c > 20 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\( c > \\frac{20}{3} \\)\n\n\\( c > 6.\\overline{6} \\)\n\nSince \\( c \\) has to be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a cupcake), and it has to be greater than approximately 6.666, the smallest integer value \\( c \\) can take is 7.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if this makes sense with the original equations. Let's plug \\( c = 7 \\) back into the equation for \\( k \\):\n\n\\( k = 20 - 2(7) = 20 - 14 = 6 \\)\n\nSo, \\( c = 7 \\) and \\( k = 6 \\), which satisfies \\( c > k \\) since 7 > 6. The total cost would be \\( 2(7) + 1(6) = 14 + 6 = 20 \\), which matches the total spent.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimum number of cupcakes she could have purchased, given that she bought more cupcakes than cookies. So, is there a way for her to buy fewer than 7 cupcakes while still satisfying both the total cost and the condition that cupcakes are more than cookies?\n\nLet's try \\( c = 6 \\) to see what happens:\n\n\\( k = 20 - 2(6) = 20 - 12 = 8 \\)\n\nNow, \\( c = 6 \\) and \\( k = 8 \\), but this doesn't satisfy \\( c > k \\) because 6 is not greater than 8. So, \\( c = 6 \\) is not a valid solution.\n\nWhat about \\( c = 7 \\), which we already tried? That worked, but maybe there's a smaller number that also works. However, since \\( c \\) has to be greater than approximately 6.666 and an integer, 7 is the smallest possible integer value for \\( c \\).\n\nTo be thorough, let's check \\( c = 8 \\):\n\n\\( k = 20 - 2(8) = 20 - 16 = 4 \\)\n\nHere, \\( c = 8 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\), which satisfies \\( c > k \\). The total cost is \\( 2(8) + 1(4) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\). This is also a valid solution, but it's not the minimum number of cupcakes.\n\nSimilarly, \\( c = 9 \\):\n\n\\( k = 20 - 2(9) = 20 - 18 = 2 \\)\n\nAgain, \\( c = 9 > 2 = k \\), and the total cost is \\( 2(9) + 1(2) = 18 + 2 = 20 \\). Valid but not minimal.\n\nAnd \\( c = 10 \\):\n\n\\( k = 20 - 2(10) = 20 - 20 = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( c = 10 > 0 = k \\), and the total cost is \\( 2(10) + 1(0) = 20 + 0 = 20 \\). This is valid, but again, not minimal.\n\nNow, let's consider if there are any other possible values for \\( c \\) between 6 and 7. Since \\( c \\) must be an integer, there are no values in between. Therefore, the smallest possible integer value for \\( c \\) that satisfies both the total cost and the condition \\( c > k \\) is 7.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's consider if there's a way to interpret the problem that might allow for a different solution. The problem states that Jane bought a combination of cupcakes and cookies, meaning she bought at least one of each. So, \\( c \\geq 1 \\) and \\( k \\geq 1 \\).\n\nIn our solution, \\( c = 7 \\) and \\( k = 6 \\), which satisfies this. If we try \\( c = 10 \\) and \\( k = 0 \\), that would technically satisfy \\( c > k \\) since 10 > 0, and the total cost is $20, but the problem says she bought a combination of cupcakes and cookies, which probably implies that she bought at least one of each. Therefore, \\( k \\geq 1 \\), and \\( c \\geq 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( c = 7 \\) and \\( k = 6 \\) is indeed the minimal number of cupcakes she could have bought while satisfying all the given conditions.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to maximize the number of cookies while still satisfying the total cost and the condition that cupcakes are more than cookies. If she buys as many cookies as possible, that would minimize the number of cupcakes.\n\nLet's try to maximize \\( k \\) while keeping \\( c > k \\) and \\( 2c + k = 20 \\).\n\nFrom \\( c > k \\), and \\( c = \\frac{20 - k}{2} \\), we can substitute:\n\n\\( \\frac{20 - k}{2} > k \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 20 - k > 2k \\)\n\n\\( 20 > 3k \\)\n\n\\( k < \\frac{20}{3} \\)\n\n\\( k < 6.\\overline{6} \\)\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer, the maximum possible value for \\( k \\) is 6.\n\nThen, \\( c = \\frac{20 - 6}{2} = 7 \\), which matches our earlier solution.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of cupcakes Jane could have purchased is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
