        "content": "So John has this book with 300 pages, and he plans to read 15 pages every day. I need to figure out how many days it will take him to finish the whole book. Hmm, this seems like a division problem to me.\n\nI think I should divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day. So, that's 300 pages divided by 15 pages per day. Let me do that calculation.\n\n300 divided by 15. Well, 15 times 20 is 300, so it should be 20 days. But let me make sure. Maybe I can check this by multiplying 15 by 20 to see if I get 300. Okay, 15 times 20 is indeed 300. So, it looks like it will take him 20 days to finish the book.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if there are any remainders or if he reads a different amount on the last day. Let me see. 15 times 20 is exactly 300, so there are no remaining pages. So, no need to worry about extra days.\n\nBut maybe I should think about whether he reads every day without any breaks. The question says he reads 15 pages every day, so I assume he reads every day without taking any days off. So, it should be a straightforward calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so I could calculate how many weeks it would take. But since the number of days comes out to be 20, which is less than a month, maybe it's simpler to just leave it as days.\n\nAlso, perhaps I should consider if the book has any illustrations or anything that might affect the reading pace, but the question doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll stick with the given numbers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it will take John 20 days to finish reading the 300-page book if he reads 15 pages every day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
