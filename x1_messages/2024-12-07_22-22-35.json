        "content": "To determine the break-even point, we need to find out how many units must be produced and sold so that the total revenue equals the total cost. The total cost includes both the fixed costs and the variable costs.\n\nFirst, let's identify the given information:\n\n- Production rate: 100 units per day\n\n- Variable cost per unit: $10\n\n- Fixed costs per day: $500\n\n- Selling price per unit: $15\n\nThe break-even point is where total revenue equals total cost.\n\nTotal Revenue (TR) = Selling price per unit \u00d7 Number of units sold\n\nTotal Cost (TC) = Fixed costs + (Variable cost per unit \u00d7 Number of units produced)\n\nAt break-even point:\n\nTR = TC\n\nSo,\n\nSelling price per unit \u00d7 Number of units = Fixed costs + (Variable cost per unit \u00d7 Number of units)\n\nLet's denote the number of units as Q.\n\nTherefore:\n\n15Q = 500 + 10Q\n\nNow, we need to solve for Q.\n\nSubtract 10Q from both sides:\n\n15Q - 10Q = 500\n\n5Q = 500\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\nQ = 500 / 5\n\nQ = 100 units\n\nSo, the factory needs to produce and sell 100 units to break even.\n\nWait a minute, the factory already produces 100 units per day. Does that mean they break even exactly at their current production level?\n\nLet's verify this.\n\nCalculate total revenue at 100 units:\n\nTR = 15 \u00d7 100 = $1,500\n\nCalculate total cost at 100 units:\n\nTC = 500 + (10 \u00d7 100) = 500 + 1,000 = $1,500\n\n indeed, TR = TC = $1,500, so they break even at 100 units.\n\nBut let's think about this more deeply. Is there a way to minimize costs or maximize profit here?\n\nWell, at break-even, there is no profit or loss. If they sell more than 100 units, they start making a profit. If they sell less, they incur a loss.\n\nGiven that, perhaps they should aim to produce and sell more than 100 units to make a profit.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the break-even point, which we've found to be 100 units.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are any constraints or other factors that might affect this.\n\nFor example, is there a maximum number of units they can sell? Is there a demand constraint?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any constraints beyond the given costs and selling price.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the break-even point is 100 units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at this using the contribution margin approach.\n\nThe contribution margin per unit is the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit.\n\nContribution margin per unit = 15 - 10 = $5\n\nThe break-even point in units is then fixed costs divided by contribution margin per unit.\n\nBreak-even point (Q) = Fixed costs / Contribution margin per unit\n\nQ = 500 / 5 = 100 units\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the method used, the break-even point is 100 units.\n\nTherefore, the factory must produce and sell 100 units to break even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]\n"
