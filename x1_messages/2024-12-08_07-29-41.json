        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two trains moving towards each other on the same track, leaving from different towns at different times. I need to find out when they cross each other.\n\nFirst, let's note down the details:\n\n- Train 1 leaves Town A at 3 PM and arrives in Town B at 7 PM.\n\n- Train 2 leaves Town B at 4 PM and arrives in Town A at 8 PM.\n\nSo, Train 1 takes 4 hours to travel from Town A to Town B (from 3 PM to 7 PM).\n\nTrain 2 takes 4 hours to travel from Town B to Town A (from 4 PM to 8 PM).\n\nLet's assume the distance between Town A and Town B is D kilometers.\n\nThen, the speed of Train 1 is D / 4 km/h.\n\nSimilarly, the speed of Train 2 is D / 4 km/h.\n\nWait a minute, both trains have the same speed? That seems odd, but okay, perhaps it's possible.\n\nNow, I need to find out when these two trains cross each other.\n\nLet's think about their positions at different times.\n\nTrain 1 starts at 3 PM from Town A.\n\nTrain 2 starts at 4 PM from Town B.\n\nSo, Train 1 has already been traveling for 1 hour before Train 2 starts.\n\nIn that 1 hour, Train 1 covers a distance of (D/4) * 1 = D/4 kilometers.\n\nSo, at 4 PM, Train 1 is D/4 kilometers away from Town A, and Train 2 starts from Town B.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, each at a speed of D/4 km/h.\n\nThe distance between them at 4 PM is D - D/4 = 3D/4 kilometers.\n\nNow, since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds:\n\nD/4 + D/4 = D/2 km/h.\n\nNow, time taken to cover 3D/4 kilometers at a relative speed of D/2 km/h is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = (3D/4) / (D/2) = (3D/4) * (2/D) = 3/2 hours = 1.5 hours.\n\nSo, they will cross each other 1.5 hours after 4 PM.\n\nTherefore, the time they cross each other is 4 PM + 1 hour 30 minutes = 5:30 PM.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the positions of both trains as functions of time and find when their positions coincide.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system where Town A is at position 0 and Town B is at position D.\n\nLet t be the time in hours since 3 PM.\n\nSo, Train 1's position as a function of t is:\n\nx1(t) = (D/4) * t\n\nTrain 2 leaves at 4 PM, which is t = 1 hour.\n\nSo, Train 2's position as a function of t is:\n\nx2(t) = D - (D/4) * (t - 1), for t >= 1\n\nWe need to find t where x1(t) = x2(t).\n\nSo:\n\n(D/4) * t = D - (D/4) * (t - 1)\n\nLet's solve for t:\n\n(D/4) * t = D - (D/4) * (t - 1)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4/D to simplify:\n\nt = 4 - (t - 1)\n\nt = 4 - t + 1\n\nt = 5 - t\n\n2t = 5\n\nt = 2.5 hours\n\nSo, they cross each other at t = 2.5 hours after 3 PM.\n\n3 PM + 2.5 hours = 5:30 PM\n\nOkay, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check it another way.\n\nLet's consider the time between 4 PM and when they cross, which is 1.5 hours, and see if the distances add up.\n\nAt 4 PM, Train 1 has already traveled 1 hour, covering D/4 kilometers, so it's at position D/4.\n\nTrain 2 starts at position D.\n\nIn the next 1.5 hours:\n\nTrain 1 travels another 1.5 * (D/4) = 3D/8 kilometers, so its position is D/4 + 3D/8 = (2D/8 + 3D/8) = 5D/8\n\nTrain 2 travels 1.5 * (D/4) = 3D/8 kilometers towards Town A, so its position is D - 3D/8 = 5D/8\n\nYes, both trains are at 5D/8 at 5:30 PM, so they meet there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of relative speed.\n\nFrom 4 PM onwards, Train 1 is already at D/4, and Train 2 starts at D.\n\nTheir relative speed is D/4 + D/4 = D/2 km/h.\n\nDistance between them at 4 PM is D - D/4 = 3D/4.\n\nTime to meet is (3D/4) / (D/2) = 1.5 hours, which again brings us to 5:30 PM.\n\nSeems consistent across different methods.\n\nTherefore, the two trains cross each other at 5:30 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5:30 \\text{ PM}} \\]\n"
