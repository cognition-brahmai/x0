In one meeting, Trump seized his interpreter\\'s notes and demanded the details not be shared with anyone else. In the other, Trump and Putin were alone except for Putin\\'s interpreter. No other American was present. All of this happening the same day that the \"New York Times\" reached out to the White House about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which involved Don Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and Russians who said they had dirt on Hillary Clinton. Just a coincidence? Sara Murray is out front. SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A private dinnertime chat between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in 2017 sparking new questions about what exactly the two men discussed. As Trump geared up for meetings with world leaders, the White House received an unwelcome inquiry. \"The New York Times\" had learned that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort met with a Russian lawyer at Trump tower in the summer of 2016. Trump\\'s lawyers had known of the meeting for weeks, but now \"The Times\" was doing a story and need a comment. That afternoon, Trump and Putin met for two hours. TRUMP: It\\'s an honor to be with you. Thank you. MURRAY: Seeming to hit it off, even as Putin denied meddling in the 2016 election. REX TILLERSON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: There was a very clear, positive chemistry between the two. MURRAY: Then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had been in the room, along with translators. But a former State Department official tells CNN the President confiscated the American interpreter\\'s notes and insisted the staffer keep the details of the conversation secret. The White House insists that\\'s outrageously inaccurate. That evening in Germany, Trump sought out Putin at a dinner for world leaders. The two men spoke for roughly an hour. The meeting, which was eventually confirmed by the White House, wouldn\\'t become public for more than a week. IAN BREMMER, EURASIA GROUP PRESIDENT: No one attended that from Trump\\'s side. There was no translator there. There was no adviser there. It was just Trump. For him not to say then afterwards, oh, by the way, let me give you a quick debrief on the meeting I have with Putin, that\\'s exceptionally unusual. MURRAY: Trump\\'s meeting came soon after Justice Department officials had moved to open a probe into Trump for potential obstruction of justice, an investigation that included trying to answer a disturbing question. Was Trump making moves designed to benefit Russia or was he merely an innocent party? There\\'s no indication Trump knew at the time that he was under investigation. After Trump\\'s double face-to-face with Putin in Hamburg, he headed back to the U.S. Aboard Air Force One, Trump and his advisers hashed out a statement to respond to the \"New York Times.\" According to the statement, in Donald Trump Jr.\\'s name, \"We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children in the 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer.\" Days later, it came out that the lawyer had actually promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. As the carefully crafted statement fell apart, Trump was still talking up Russian adoptions, insisting that\\'s what he and Putin discussed over dessert. TRUMP: I actually talked about Russian adoption with him, which is interesting, because that was a part of a conversation that Don had in this meeting. MURRAY: Now, Andrew Wies, a Russia expert at the Carnegie endowment was one of the prominent voices questioning whether all of these events were just happen in stance. But a number of Democratic lawmakers have also come out in the wake of what we\\'ve learned about how secretive the President has been about his meetings with the Russian President and said, we really need a lot more information. Erin? BURNETT: All right. Sara, thank you. And I want to go now to former federal prosecutor, Jack Weiss, also a former Democratic member of the Los Angeles City Council, and CNN chief political analyst, Gloria Borger. Jack, your name is not a coincidence. Your brother is Andrew, right, as Sara was just referring to. He posted this thread on Twitter about the timeline crediting you with the idea. How did you connect all the ideas here? JACK WEISS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, look, Andrew is a Russia policy expert and I\\'m a former fed. So for the last two years, we just go back and forth on a daily basis whenever something pops up. When the Hamburg summit first occurred and Ian Bremmer came out with that scoop of his after the summit that Trump had sought Putin out and had met with him privately. We both thought that was bizarre and probably indicative of something. Over the weekend that just passed, when \"The Washington Post\" reported that Trump had confiscated his interpreter\\'s notes from the meeting earlier in the day, instructed that interpreter not to talk about the meeting with anyone. We just thought it was important to lay out the whole chronology that Sara just did in her report. You put all of that together and for me as a former fed, I say, it\\'s the crucible. It\\'s the crucible, when your defendants, your targets are getting found out. What do they do when they learn that someone\\'s on to them, as \"The New York Times\" was on to them, and notified the White House on the morning of July 7th? BURNETT: I mean -- and they make that call. Now, Gloria, of course, in one of the meetings, right, Rex Tillerson is there. You might think, OK, at this point he would have leaked out whatever happened, but there was then a second meeting, right where there wasn\\'t even an American interpreter present, right? It was just Putin, Trump, and Putin\\'s interpreter. Private conversation that occurred, that was somewhere between 15 minutes and 40 minutes, depending on who you believe. Could all this just be a coincidence? This timing that there\\'s these meetings on the day \"The New York Times\", you know, asked for this response and then the next day the President has a response, which, by the way, turns out to be untrue. GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: By the way, we didn\\'t know about the second meeting for quite some time, right? BURNETT: Right. That\\'s a fair point. BORGER: I mean it wasn\\'t as if they came out and said, oh, by the way, the President just met with Vladimir Putin -- BURNETT: Yes. To your point, Ian Bremmer is the one who found out about it. That\\'s how we got -- yes, yes. BORGER: Right, exactly. It wasn\\'t anything they wanted to reveal, which is also extraordinary, when it comes to two heads of state having a secret meeting. You know, could it all be coincidence? OK. You have to allow that -- sure, it could. But don\\'t forget, we have been involved in covering this Russia story for quite some time. And is it a coincidence that 16 members of the President\\'s campaign or associates of the President\\'s campaign had dealings with Russia? Well, you could say that\\'s a coincidence, too, for a very small campaign. So, I think that timelines like this, the one that the Weiss\\' are talking about, that was Sara Murray\\'s timeline, lead people to raise a lot of questions. And I think these are the questions that the Democrats are raising and that Mueller is raising, because attorneys set up timelines like this to try and figure out whether to connect the dots and see whether one thing is related to another thing. And here, when you have the Trump Tower meeting, you have the President writing a misleading -- dictating a misleading statement, a meeting with Putin not revealed to the press, you know, you have to sometimes put one and one together and get two. BURNETT: Right. And I guess you say, you know, you say sometimes it\\'s correlation causality, is correlation conspiracy or collusion, maybe the right way to ask the question in this case. I mean, Jack, if the President and Putin did discuss, you know, this \"New York Times\" story that it was coming and a response to it, how bad would that be? WEISS: Well, it would be -- I think it\\'s disastrous for them. Remember, at that moment, on the morning of July 7th, no one, no one in the public knows that a year earlier, there had been that infamous Trump Tower meeting between Trump\\'s son, his son-in-law, and his campaign chairman and agents of the Russian government. No one knew that. So when \"The New York Times\" calls the White House the morning of July 7 and says, \"we\\'re about to report this.\" If you\\'re on the Trump team, you have to think, this is a -- this could be a devastating story. What does Trump do after that? He has the two-hour meeting, and then he seeks out Putin on his own. What\\'s interesting about him seeking out Putin on his own at that G20 Summit is -- Trump\\'s an amateur. Putin is the ultimate pro. Putin knows at that moment what eyes and ears are on that conversation, and it will be very interesting when we learn, and one day we\\'re going to learn, what Putin said to him that was maybe evocative in relating to the cover story that Trump hatched the next day. BURNETT: And of course, you know, interesting what if Trump did seek that out, right, given that there was no one else on his -- the American side and even an interpreter for that conversation. Gloria, also this reporting tonight, the President\\'s nominee for attorney general, Bill Barr, right, he said, \"I\\'m going to have --\" no, \"I\\'m not going to get involved with the Mueller thing, I\\'m totally fine with it, it needs to go ahead.\" BORGER: Right. BURNETT: He\\'s obviously testifying tomorrow. You know, if he\\'s going to get approved to be attorney general. And we\\'re now finding out tonight, CNN reporting, that there was a memo that he wrote supportive of the President\\'s view on obstruction of justice. And he wrote it, great detailed memo supporting the President and he discussed it with the President. That\\'s a big deal. BORGER: Well, he not only -- he discussed it with the President\\'s attorneys. He discussed it with, you know, the President\\'s attorneys, who were trying to come up with their own legal theories about obstruction of justice. He\\'s completely allowed to do that, as a private citizen. He wrote a memo and distributed it, all-around, and then discussed it verbally with them. And so the question I think that we\\'re going to hear the Democrats raise tomorrow is, was he putting the thumb on the scale? Was he saying, hey, I\\'m a good lawyer, I can give you some legal arguments. And then we -- you know, we know what he said about his views of the special counsel, how it ought to be independent, et cetera, et cetera. But I think this does give the Democrats a new set of talking points to raise against him tomorrow. BURNETT: I mean, it\\'s pretty incredible, right? BORGER: No, I don\\'t -- well, you know, I don\\'t know. I don\\'t think it would be normal, but nothing is normal in this administration. And don\\'t forget, you know, you have Whitaker there now, who also holds the same view or some view about the special counsel and the investigation. He\\'s called it a witch hunt. I think Bob Barr is certainly qualified to be attorney general, but, you know, these questions about a conflict are certainly going to be raised. BURNETT: All right. Thank you both so very much. And next, President Trump claims he\\'s winning over Democrats when it comes to this. TRUMP: Many of them are saying we agree with you. Many of them are calling and many of them are breaking. BURNETT: Talking about the wall. Plus, Senator Mitt Romney calling for fellow Republican Steve King to resign. Will it happen? We have details about a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, coming up.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 20 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"
