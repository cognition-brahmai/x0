        "content": "So you're trying to find the limit of (x\u00b2 + 1)/(x\u00b2 - 1) as x approaches infinity. Limits can be a bit tricky, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, when you're dealing with limits as x approaches infinity, you're essentially seeing what happens to the function as x gets really, really large. In this case, both the numerator and the denominator are quadratic functions, meaning they both grow as x squared when x is large.\n\nOne common approach to finding limits of rational functions as x approaches infinity is to divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator. Here, the highest power of x in the denominator is x\u00b2, so let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by x\u00b2.\n\nSo, (x\u00b2 + 1)/(x\u00b2 - 1) becomes:\n\nNumerator: (x\u00b2 + 1)/x\u00b2 = 1 + 1/x\u00b2\n\nDenominator: (x\u00b2 - 1)/x\u00b2 = 1 - 1/x\u00b2\n\nSo the expression simplifies to (1 + 1/x\u00b2)/(1 - 1/x\u00b2).\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, 1/x\u00b2 approaches 0 because any constant divided by a really large number squared will get really small.\n\nSo, substituting 0 for 1/x\u00b2, we get (1 + 0)/(1 - 0) = 1/1 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the limit as x approaches infinity of (x\u00b2 + 1)/(x\u00b2 - 1) is 1.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure. Another way to think about this is to consider the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator. Since both are degree 2, the limit as x approaches infinity should be the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nIn this case, the leading coefficient of the numerator is 1 (from x\u00b2) and the leading coefficient of the denominator is also 1 (from x\u00b2). So, the limit should be 1/1 = 1, which matches what we found earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what happens if we plug in a really large value for x. Let's say x = 1,000,000.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 = 1,000,000,000,000\n\nSo, (x\u00b2 + 1)/(x\u00b2 - 1) = (1,000,000,000,000 + 1)/(1,000,000,000,000 - 1) = 1,000,000,000,001 / 999,999,999,999\n\nThis is approximately 1.000000000001 / 0.999999999999, which is very close to 1.\n\nSo, all these methods confirm that the limit is indeed 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
