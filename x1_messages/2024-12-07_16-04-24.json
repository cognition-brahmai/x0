        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing quicksort in Java:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot element**: This can be any element in the array, but common choices are the first element, the last element, or the middle element.\n\n2. **Partition the array**: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays**: Apply the same process to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.\n\nHere's a simple Java implementation of the quicksort algorithm:\n\n```java\npublic class QuickSort {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] array = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};\n        quickSort(array, 0, array.length - 1);\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted array:\");\n        printArray(array);\n    }\n\n    public static void quickSort(int[] array, int low, int high) {\n        if (low < high) {\n            // Find pivot element such that\n            // element smaller than pivot are on the left\n            // elements greater than pivot are on the right\n            int pi = partition(array, low, high);\n\n            // Recursively sort elements before partition and after partition\n            quickSort(array, low, pi - 1);\n            quickSort(array, pi + 1, high);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static int partition(int[] array, int low, int high) {\n        // Choose the rightmost element as pivot\n        int pivot = array[high];\n        int i = low - 1;\n\n        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {\n            // If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot\n            if (array[j] <= pivot) {\n                i++;\n                // Swap array[i] and array[j]\n                int temp = array[i];\n                array[i] = array[j];\n                array[j] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Swap array[i+1] and array[high] (or pivot)\n        int temp = array[i + 1];\n        array[i + 1] = array[high];\n        array[high] = temp;\n\n        return i + 1;\n    }\n\n    public static void printArray(int[] array) {\n        for (int value : array) {\n            System.out.print(value + \" \");\n        }\n        System.out.println();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **quickSort method**: This is the main method that implements the quicksort algorithm. It takes the array and the indices of the sub-array to be sorted. If the sub-array has more than one element (i.e., `low < high`), it partitions the array and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n\n2. **partition method**: This method selects the pivot (here, the last element of the sub-array), rearranges the array so that elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right. It returns the index of the pivot after partitioning.\n\n3. **printArray method**: A utility method to print the array elements.\n\n### How to use:\n\n- Create an instance of the `QuickSort` class.\n- Call the `quickSort` method with the array and the indices of the sub-array to be sorted.\n- Print the sorted array using the `printArray` method.\n\nThis implementation should work for most cases, but keep in mind that quicksort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n\u00b2), although on average it performs at O(n log n). To improve performance, you might consider choosing a better pivot or using a different sorting algorithm for small sub-arrays."
