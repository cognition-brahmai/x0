        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group of friends who went on a trip and shared the expenses equally. The total expenses were $200 on food, $150 on transportation, and $250 on accommodations. That means the total cost is $200 + $150 + $250 = $600.\n\nNow, let's say there were n friends on the trip. Each friend contributed an equal amount, so each person paid $600 divided by n, which is $600/n.\n\nThe problem says that if one more friend had joined the trip, each person would have paid $20 less. So, if there were n + 1 friends, each would have paid $600/(n + 1), and this amount is $20 less than what they actually paid. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n$600/n - $600/(n + 1) = $20\n\nNow, we need to solve for n. Let's manipulate this equation to find the value of n.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation again:\n\n600/n - 600/(n + 1) = 20\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, we can find a common denominator for the fractions, which would be n(n + 1). So, let's multiply both sides of the equation by n(n + 1):\n\n[600/n - 600/(n + 1)] * n(n + 1) = 20 * n(n + 1)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n600(n + 1) - 600n = 20n(n + 1)\n\nLet's expand the left side:\n\n600n + 600 - 600n = 20n^2 + 20n\n\nThe 600n terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n600 = 20n^2 + 20n\n\nNow, let's move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n20n^2 + 20n - 600 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing all terms by 20:\n\nn^2 + n - 30 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation: n^2 + n - 30 = 0\n\nTo solve for n, we can either factor this equation or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nWe need two numbers that multiply to -30 and add up to 1 (the coefficient of n). Let's think of such numbers. 6 and -5 come to mind because 6 * -5 = -30 and 6 + (-5) = 1.\n\nSo, we can factor the equation as:\n\n(n + 6)(n - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions for n:\n\nn + 6 = 0  =>  n = -6\n\nn - 5 = 0  =>  n = 5\n\nSince the number of friends can't be negative, we discard n = -6. Therefore, n = 5.\n\nSo, there were 5 friends on the trip.\n\nLet's check if this makes sense. If there were 5 friends, each would have paid $600 / 5 = $120. If one more friend joined, making it 6 friends, each would have paid $600 / 6 = $100, which is indeed $20 less than $120. Perfect, it checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
