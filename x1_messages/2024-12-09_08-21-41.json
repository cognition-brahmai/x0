        "content": "Let's see here. The store sells two kinds of cookies: chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin. They sold 120 chocolate chip cookies at $0.75 each and 80 oatmeal raisin cookies at $1.00 each. I need to find out how much money they made in total from selling these cookies in one day.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total sales from the chocolate chip cookies. They sold 120 of them at $0.75 each. So, I'll multiply 120 by 0.75.\n\n120 \u00d7 0.75 = ?\n\nWell, 100 \u00d7 0.75 is 75, and 20 \u00d7 0.75 is 15. So, 75 + 15 equals 90. So, they made $90 from chocolate chip cookies.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total sales from the oatmeal raisin cookies. They sold 80 at $1.00 each. That seems straightforward.\n\n80 \u00d7 1.00 = 80. So, they made $80 from oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\nNow, to find the total money made from both types of cookies, I'll add the two amounts together.\n\n90 + 80 = 170.\n\nTherefore, the store made $170 from selling cookies that day.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check those calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, 120 \u00d7 0.75:\n\n120 \u00d7 0.75 = (100 \u00d7 0.75) + (20 \u00d7 0.75) = 75 + 15 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nSecond, 80 \u00d7 1.00 = 80. That's obvious.\n\nAdding them up: 90 + 80 = 170. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the store made $170 from selling cookies that day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{170} \\]"
