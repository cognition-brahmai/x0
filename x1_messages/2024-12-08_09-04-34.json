        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with marbles of different colors: 5 green, 3 blue, and 2 red. And I need to find the probability of drawing a blue marble at random.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is basically the chance of something happening, and it's calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, in this case, the favorable outcome is drawing a blue marble. And the total outcomes are all the marbles in the bag.\n\nLet me count the total number of marbles. There are 5 green, 3 blue, and 2 red. So, total marbles = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 marbles.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of blue marbles, which is 3.\n\nSo, the probability P of drawing a blue marble is P = number of blue marbles / total number of marbles = 3/10.\n\nWait, but I should check if this fraction can be simplified. 3 and 10 don't have any common factors other than 1, so 3/10 is already in its simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this probability as a decimal or a percentage. As a decimal, 3/10 is 0.3, and as a percentage, it's 30%.\n\nBut since the question didn't specify the form, I'll stick with the fraction 3/10.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Total marbles are indeed 10, blue marbles are 3, so yes, 3/10 makes sense.\n\nI think that's the answer. Probability of drawing a blue marble is 3/10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}} \\]"
