Each tool will produce an evidence value, which is the output of one or more functions given an input string that can be either the user's query, previous evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools you can use:\nSearchEngine[input]: This tool allows users to search for information on the internet. It doesn't directly provide answers but offers a list of websites that might contain the needed information.\nWebScraper[input]: This tool extracts plain text from one or more websites provided in the input string (links separated by newline).\nLinkExtractor[input]: This tool pulls out links from any given plain text and provides a plain text response with newline-separated links.\nQAEngine[input]: A tool capable of answering questions based on common knowledge as well as specific context derived from prior evidence. The input should be a question that may reference an :evidence[n]: variable.\n\nThe function inputs must be plain strings without quotes or \"+\" to concatenate a string with an evidence variable, e.g., QAEngine[What is the capital of France, given :evidence1:?]\n\nRemember to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [first action based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function call and input parameter, potentially referencing previous evidence like \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is the population of Tokyo and what are some popular tourist attractions there?"
