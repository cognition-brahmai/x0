        "content": "Before chemotherapy became the standard treatment for cancer, radium was indeed used to treat certain diseases, primarily cancer. Radium, being radioactive, was utilized for its ability to emit radiation, which could kill cancer cells or inhibit their growth. One of the main diseases treated with radium was cancer, particularly cancers of the cervix, uterus, and prostate.\n\nThe use of radium in medicine dates back to the early 20th century, following its discovery by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898. Its radioactive properties were seen as a potential tool in fighting cancer, and it was used in a variety of ways, including implantation directly into tumors or application externally.\n\nHowever, the use of radium came with significant risks. Radium is highly radioactive and exposure to it can lead to radiation sickness, genetic mutations, and increased cancer risk. Perhaps the most famous case related to radium's dangers is that of the \"Radium Girls,\" who painted radium onto watch dials and consequently suffered severe health effects due to radium poisoning.\n\nWith the development of safer and more effective forms of radiation therapy, such as external beam radiation and brachytherapy using safer isotopes, the use of radium in medicine has been phased out. Today, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and other modern treatments are used to manage and treat cancer.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question: before chemotherapy became widespread, radium was used primarily to treat cancer, especially gynecological and prostate cancers."
