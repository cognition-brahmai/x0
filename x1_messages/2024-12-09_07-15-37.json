        "content": "Given the user's input, \"I want to know the weather forecast for New York City tomorrow,\" the most appropriate function to use is `weather_forecast`. This function is specifically designed to provide weather forecasts for specified locations and dates.\n\nTo fulfill the user's request, we need to identify the location and the date they are interested in. From the input, the location is \"New York City\" and the date is \"tomorrow.\"\n\nTherefore, the parameters for the `weather_forecast` function should be set as follows:\n\n- `location`: \"New York City\"\n\n- `date`: \"tomorrow\"\n\nIt's important to note that \"tomorrow\" is a relative term and should be interpreted based on the current date when the query is made. The system likely has the capability to interpret relative dates such as \"tomorrow,\" \"today,\" or \"next week.\"\n\nGiven this, the response in JSON format would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"weather_forecast\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"location\": \"New York City\",\n    \"date\": \"tomorrow\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object specifies the function to call and provides the necessary parameters to obtain the desired weather forecast for New York City tomorrow."
