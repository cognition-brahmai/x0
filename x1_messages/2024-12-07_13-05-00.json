        "content": "So Mary buys 7 bags of apples, and each bag contains 6 apples. To find out how many apples she has in total, I need to multiply the number of bags by the number of apples in each bag. So, that's 7 bags times 6 apples per bag. Let's do the math: 7 times 6 is 42. So, Mary has 42 apples in total.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check that. If one bag has 6 apples, then two bags would have 12, three would have 18, and so on. Let's see:\n\n- 1 bag = 6 apples\n\n- 2 bags = 12 apples\n\n- 3 bags = 18 apples\n\n- 4 bags = 24 apples\n\n- 5 bags = 30 apples\n\n- 6 bags = 36 apples\n\n- 7 bags = 42 apples\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier. So, definitely, Mary has 42 apples.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the store has a special offer or something like that. Does the problem mention anything else? Oh, no, it just says that the store sells apples in bags of 6 and Mary buys 7 bags. So, no extras or anything like that.\n\nI think I've got it right. Mary has 42 apples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]"
