        "content": "So I have this double integral to evaluate: \u222cR xy dA, where R is the region bounded by y=x, y=2x, x=1, and x=2. Alright, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the region R. It's bounded by the lines y=x and y=2x, and the vertical lines x=1 and x=2. So, if I sketch this out, at x=1, y goes from y=1 (since y=x) to y=2 (since y=2x). At x=2, y goes from y=2 to y=4. So, for each x between 1 and 2, y ranges from y=x to y=2x.\n\nSo, I can set up the integral with x going from 1 to 2, and for each x, y goes from x to 2x. That means the double integral can be written as:\n\n\u222b(x=1 to x=2) \u222b(y=x to y=2x) xy dy dx.\n\nAlright, let's first integrate with respect to y, treating x as a constant.\n\nSo, \u222b(y=x to y=2x) xy dy.\n\nSince x is constant with respect to y, this becomes x * \u222b(y=x to y=2x) y dy.\n\nI know that \u222by dy = y^2/2, so plugging in the limits:\n\nx * [ (2x)^2/2 - (x)^2/2 ] = x * [ (4x^2)/2 - x^2/2 ] = x * [2x^2 - x^2/2] = x * (3x^2)/2 = (3x^3)/2.\n\nSo, the inner integral gives me (3x^3)/2.\n\nNow, I need to integrate this with respect to x from 1 to 2.\n\nSo, \u222b(x=1 to x=2) (3x^3)/2 dx.\n\nLet's factor out the constant: (3/2) \u222b(x=1 to x=2) x^3 dx.\n\nI know that \u222bx^3 dx = x^4/4.\n\nEvaluating from 1 to 2: (3/2) * [ (2)^4/4 - (1)^4/4 ] = (3/2) * [ 16/4 - 1/4 ] = (3/2) * [4 - 0.25] = (3/2) * 3.75.\n\nNow, 3.75 is 15/4, so (3/2)*(15/4) = 45/8.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check the calculations again.\n\nFirst, \u222b(y=x to y=2x) xy dy = x * [ (2x)^2/2 - x^2/2 ] = x * [4x^2/2 - x^2/2] = x * [2x^2 - x^2/2] = x * (3x^2)/2 = (3x^3)/2.\n\nThen, \u222b(x=1 to x=2) (3x^3)/2 dx = (3/2) * \u222b(x=1 to x=2) x^3 dx = (3/2) * [x^4/4] from 1 to 2.\n\nPlugging in the limits: (3/2) * [(16/4) - (1/4)] = (3/2) * (15/4) = 45/8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the value of the double integral is 45/8.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider integrating with respect to x first, instead of y, and see if I get the same answer.\n\nAlright, let's try that.\n\nIf I integrate with respect to x first, I need to express the region R in terms of y and x.\n\nThe region R is bounded by y=x and y=2x, and x goes from 1 to 2.\n\nLet me solve for x in terms of y.\n\nFrom y=x, x=y.\n\nFrom y=2x, x=y/2.\n\nSo, for a given y, x goes from x=y/2 to x=y.\n\nBut I need to find the limits for y.\n\nWhen x=1, y goes from y=1 to y=2.\n\nWhen x=2, y goes from y=2 to y=4.\n\nWait, but if I'm integrating with respect to x first, I need to express the region in terms of y.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nThe region R is bounded by y=x, y=2x, x=1, and x=2.\n\nSo, y=x is one boundary, y=2x is another.\n\nx=1 and x=2 are vertical boundaries.\n\nIf I want to integrate with respect to x first, I need to express x in terms of y.\n\nFrom y=x, x=y.\n\nFrom y=2x, x=y/2.\n\nNow, for a given y, x goes from x=y/2 to x=y.\n\nBut I need to find the range of y.\n\nWhat is the minimum and maximum y in the region R.\n\nWhen x=1, y=x=1 and y=2x=2.\n\nWhen x=2, y=x=2 and y=2x=4.\n\nSo, y ranges from 1 to 4.\n\nBut wait, for y from 1 to 2, x goes from x=y/2 to x=y.\n\nAnd for y from 2 to 4, x goes from x=y/2 to x=2.\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nLet me sketch this region again.\n\nAt x=1, y goes from y=1 to y=2.\n\nAt x=2, y goes from y=2 to y=4.\n\nSo, for y from 1 to 2, x goes from x=y/2 to x=y.\n\nAnd for y from 2 to 4, x goes from x=y/2 to x=2.\n\nSo, if I integrate with respect to x first, I need to split the integral into two parts: one from y=1 to y=2, and another from y=2 to y=4.\n\nSo, the double integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(y=1 to y=2) \u222b(x=y/2 to x=y) xy dx dy + \u222b(y=2 to y=4) \u222b(x=y/2 to x=2) xy dx dy.\n\nAlright, let's compute each part separately.\n\nFirst part: \u222b(y=1 to y=2) \u222b(x=y/2 to x=y) xy dx dy.\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to x:\n\n\u222b(x=y/2 to x=y) xy dx = y * \u222b(x=y/2 to x=y) x dx = y * [x^2/2] from y/2 to y.\n\n= y * [ (y)^2/2 - (y/2)^2/2 ] = y * [ y^2/2 - y^2/8 ] = y * (4y^2/8 - y^2/8) = y * (3y^2)/8 = (3y^3)/8.\n\nNow, integrate this with respect to y from 1 to 2:\n\n\u222b(y=1 to y=2) (3y^3)/8 dy = (3/8) \u222b(y=1 to y=2) y^3 dy = (3/8) * [y^4/4] from 1 to 2.\n\n= (3/8) * [16/4 - 1/4] = (3/8) * (15/4) = 45/32.\n\nSecond part: \u222b(y=2 to y=4) \u222b(x=y/2 to x=2) xy dx dy.\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to x:\n\n\u222b(x=y/2 to x=2) xy dx = y * \u222b(x=y/2 to x=2) x dx = y * [x^2/2] from y/2 to 2.\n\n= y * [ (4)/2 - (y/2)^2/2 ] = y * [2 - y^2/8].\n\nNow, integrate this with respect to y from 2 to 4:\n\n\u222b(y=2 to y=4) y*(2 - y^2/8) dy = \u222b(y=2 to y=4) (2y - y^3/8) dy.\n\n= 2*\u222b y dy - (1/8)*\u222b y^3 dy from y=2 to y=4.\n\n= 2*(y^2/2) - (1/8)*(y^4/4) from 2 to 4.\n\n= [y^2 - y^4/32] from 2 to 4.\n\nPlugging in y=4: 16 - 256/32 = 16 - 8 = 8.\n\nPlugging in y=2: 4 - 16/32 = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5.\n\nSo, 8 - 3.5 = 4.5 = 9/2.\n\nNow, adding the two parts together: 45/32 + 9/2 = 45/32 + 144/32 = 189/32.\n\nWait a minute, earlier when I integrated with respect to y first, I got 45/8, which is 180/32. But now I'm getting 189/32. That doesn't match. Where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst part: \u222b(y=1 to y=2) (3y^3)/8 dy = (3/8)[y^4/4] from 1 to 2 = (3/8)*(16/4 - 1/4) = (3/8)*(15/4) = 45/32.\n\nSecond part: \u222b(y=2 to y=4) (2y - y^3/8) dy = [y^2 - y^4/32] from 2 to 4 = (16 - 8) - (4 - 0.5) = 8 - 3.5 = 4.5 = 9/2.\n\nAdding them: 45/32 + 9/2 = 45/32 + 144/32 = 189/32.\n\nBut earlier, integrating with respect to y first, I got 45/8, which is 180/32.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in setting up the limits when integrating with respect to x first.\n\nLet me double-check the region R.\n\nThe region is bounded by y=x, y=2x, x=1, and x=2.\n\nSo, for x from 1 to 2, y goes from y=x to y=2x.\n\nAlternatively, for y from 1 to 4, x goes from x=y/2 to x=y, but with some constraints.\n\nWait, at x=1, y goes from 1 to 2.\n\nAt x=2, y goes from 2 to 4.\n\nBut for y from 1 to 2, x goes from x=y/2 to x=y.\n\nAnd for y from 2 to 4, x goes from x=y/2 to x=2.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nLet me consider the lines y=x and y=2x.\n\nFor a given y, x ranges from x=y/2 (from y=2x) to x=y (from y=x), but limited by x=1 and x=2.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the intersection points.\n\nWhen x=1, y=x=1 and y=2x=2.\n\nWhen x=2, y=x=2 and y=2x=4.\n\nSo, for y from 1 to 2, x goes from x=y/2 to x=y.\n\nFor y from 2 to 4, x goes from x=y/2 to x=2.\n\nSo, my earlier setup seems correct.\n\nBut the integrals give different results.\n\nMaybe I made a calculation mistake in one of them.\n\nLet me recompute the first integral when integrating with respect to y first.\n\n\u222b(x=1 to x=2) \u222b(y=x to y=2x) xy dy dx.\n\nInner integral: \u222b(y=x to y=2x) xy dy = x * [y^2/2] from y=x to y=2x = x * [(4x^2)/2 - x^2/2] = x * [2x^2 - x^2/2] = x * (3x^2)/2 = (3x^3)/2.\n\nThen, \u222b(x=1 to x=2) (3x^3)/2 dx = (3/2) * [x^4/4] from 1 to 2 = (3/2) * [16/4 - 1/4] = (3/2) * (15/4) = 45/8.\n\nAlright, that's 45/8.\n\nNow, when integrating with respect to x first, I got 189/32, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the limits for the second part.\n\nLet me re-examine the second part: \u222b(y=2 to y=4) \u222b(x=y/2 to x=2) xy dx dy.\n\nFirst, \u222b(x=y/2 to x=2) xy dx = y * \u222b(x=y/2 to x=2) x dx = y * [x^2/2] from y/2 to 2 = y * [2 - (y^2)/8].\n\nThen, \u222b(y=2 to y=4) y*(2 - y^2/8) dy = \u222b(y=2 to y=4) (2y - y^3/8) dy = [y^2 - y^4/32] from 2 to 4.\n\nPlugging in y=4: 16 - 256/32 = 16 - 8 = 8.\n\nPlugging in y=2: 4 - 16/32 = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5.\n\nSo, 8 - 3.5 = 4.5 = 9/2.\n\nNow, adding this to the first part: 45/32 + 9/2 = 45/32 + 144/32 = 189/32.\n\nBut this doesn't match 45/8, which is 180/32.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy of 9/32.\n\nI must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe when I set up the limits for integrating with respect to x first, I should have different boundaries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region needs to be divided differently.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nMaybe I should express the double integral in terms of x and y, and see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a change of variables or some other method, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the integral over the larger region and subtract.\n\nBut that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should stick with the first method, integrating with respect to y first, which gave me 45/8, and assume that's correct since it's simpler.\n\nBut I want to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the average value or something.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the integral using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use iterated integrals in a different order.\n\nWait, I already tried that, and got a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the limits.\n\nWait, perhaps when integrating with respect to x first, for y from 2 to 4, x goes from x=y/2 to x=2, but maybe there's a restriction there.\n\nWait, when y=4, x goes from x=2 to x=2, which is just x=2.\n\nWait, no, y=4 is at x=2, since y=2x implies x=2 when y=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 is at x=1 for y=2x, but x=2 for y=x.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the limits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to stick with the first method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look up an example similar to this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should accept that I made a mistake in the second method and go with the first answer.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with 45/8 as the value of the double integral.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{45}{8}} \\]"
