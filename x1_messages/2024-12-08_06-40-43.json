        "content": "So I've got this problem here: there's a rectangular garden with a length of 25 feet and a width of 12 feet, and I need to find out what the perimeter is in feet. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides: the lengths and the widths. So, in this case, there are two sides that are 25 feet each (the lengths) and two sides that are 12 feet each (the widths).\n\nThe perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the outside of it. For a rectangle, that means adding up all four sides. So, I could just add 25 plus 12 plus 25 plus 12 to get the perimeter.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n25 + 12 = 37\n\nThen, 37 + 25 = 62\n\nAnd finally, 62 + 12 = 74 feet.\n\nSo, the perimeter is 74 feet.\n\nBut wait, is there a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle that could make this quicker? I think there is. I recall that the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is equal to twice the length plus twice the width, or P = 2L + 2W.\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\nP = 2(25) + 2(12)\n\nThat's 50 + 24, which equals 74 feet. Same as before, good.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen the perimeter formula written as P = 2(L + W). Maybe I'll try that to double-check.\n\nP = 2(25 + 12) = 2(37) = 74 feet. Again, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I keep getting 74 feet as the perimeter.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to approach this. Is there a chance that the dimensions given could be different, or that I'm missing something? For example, maybe the garden has some irregular shape or there are additional parts to it, but from the problem, it clearly states that it's a rectangular garden with length 25 feet and width 12 feet.\n\nAnother thing to consider is units. The problem gives both dimensions in feet, so the perimeter should indeed be in feet as well. No need to convert units here.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The perimeter of the garden is 74 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{74} \\]"
