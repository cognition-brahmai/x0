However, it's important to note that the continents were named after Amerigo Vespucci, another Italian explorer, who recognized that Columbus had discovered new lands, not the Indies as Columbus thought. But to directly answer your question, Christopher Columbus is the explorer you're referring to, as his voyages led to the naming of the Americas, even though they are named after Amerigo Vespucci."
