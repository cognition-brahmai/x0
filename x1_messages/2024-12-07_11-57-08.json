        "content": "This question is about a fundamental concept in mathematical analysis, specifically regarding properties of functions from the set of real numbers to itself. The definition provided describes a particular behavior of the function f concerning how close the outputs are when the inputs are close, with a universal quantification over the domain. Let's break down the definition and see what property it describes.\n\nThe definition states that for every positive \u03b5, there exists a positive \u03b4 such that for all x and y in R, if the distance between x and y is less than \u03b4, then the distance between f(x) and f(y) is less than \u03b5. This sounds a lot like the definition of continuity, but there's a crucial difference in the quantifiers.\n\nIn standard continuity at a point c, for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that if |x - c| < \u03b4, then |f(x) - f(c)| < \u03b5. However, in this definition, the \u03b4 depends only on \u03b5 and not on the specific point c. This means that the same \u03b4 works for all points in the domain R.\n\nThis stronger condition is known as uniform continuity. So, the property being described here is uniform continuity.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. Continuity: This is too general because continuity can be pointwise, meaning \u03b4 may depend on both \u03b5 and the point c.\n\nB. Uniform continuity: This matches the definition provided, where \u03b4 depends only on \u03b5 and not on the specific points x and y.\n\nC. Differentiability: This is a separate property that involves the existence of derivatives and is not directly related to the given definition.\n\nD. Integrability: This refers to the ability to compute integrals of the function and is not related to the given definition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Uniform continuity.\n\nHowever, to ensure that I'm not missing something, let's think about whether this could be related to other properties.\n\nIs uniform continuity the same as continuity? No, uniform continuity is a stronger condition because it requires a single \u03b4 to work across the entire domain for a given \u03b5, whereas continuity allows \u03b4 to vary with both \u03b5 and the point c.\n\nCould this be related to differentiability? Differentiability implies continuity but not necessarily uniform continuity. For example, the function f(x) = x\u00b2 is continuous and differentiable everywhere on R, but it is not uniformly continuous on R because as x grows, smaller \u03b4 is needed for the same \u03b5.\n\nWhat about integrability? Integrability is about the existence of integrals of the function over certain intervals and is not directly related to the closeness of function values for close inputs.\n\nHence, the property described in the definition is indeed uniform continuity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
