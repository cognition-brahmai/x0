        "content": "Sure! Here's an overview of the solar system in YAML format, listing the eight planets, their average distance from the Sun in astronomical units (AU), and one distinguishing feature for each:\n\n```yaml\nsolar_system:\n  planets:\n    - name: Mercury\n      average_distance_from_sun-au: 0.39\n      distinguishing_feature: Closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the solar system.\n\n    - name: Venus\n      average_distance_from_sun-au: 0.72\n      distinguishing_feature: Known for its thick atmosphere and extreme surface temperatures, making it the hottest planet in the solar system.\n\n    - name: Earth\n      average_distance_from_sun-au: 1.00\n      distinguishing_feature: The only planet known to support life, with abundant liquid water and a breathable atmosphere.\n\n    - name: Mars\n      average_distance_from_sun-au: 1.52\n      distinguishing_feature: Often called the \"Red Planet\" due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.\n\n    - name: Jupiter\n      average_distance_from_sun-au: 5.20\n      distinguishing_feature: The largest planet in the solar system, known for its Great Red Spot, a persistent storm larger than Earth.\n\n    - name: Saturn\n      average_distance_from_sun-au: 9.58\n      distinguishing_feature: Famous for its extensive and beautiful ring system composed of ice and rock particles.\n\n    - name: Uranus\n      average_distance_from_sun-au: 19.22\n      distinguishing_feature: Known for its unique sideways rotation; its axis is tilted almost parallel to its orbit.\n\n    - name: Neptune\n      average_distance_from_sun-au: 30.05\n      distinguishing_feature: The windiest planet in the solar system, with supersonic winds reaching up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph).\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more information."
