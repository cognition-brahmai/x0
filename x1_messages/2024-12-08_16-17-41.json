I've heard that when it was first built for the 1889 World's Fair, some people weren't too fond of its design. In fact, it was called \"La Dame de Fer,\" which means \"The Iron Lady\" in French. But over time, it has become a symbol of France and a must-see attraction for tourists from all around the world. It's fascinating how something that was initially met with criticism can evolve into such an important and beloved landmark."
