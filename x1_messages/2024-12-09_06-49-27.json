He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures.\n\nEdison is often characterized by his relentless work ethic, practical mindset, and insatiable curiosity. His tenacity and perseverance are legendary; he once famously said, \"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\" Despite numerous setbacks and failures, Edison never gave up on his pursuits, demonstrating a level of resilience that became the cornerstone of his success.\n\nHis most famous invention, the practical electric light bulb, revolutionized daily life and set the stage for the modern industrialized world. Yet, it was not simply the result of a single stroke of genius. It took thousands of experiments and countless hours of work to perfect the design.\n\nBeyond inventing, Edison also had a knack for business and entrepreneurship. He founded multiple companies, including General Electric, which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world today. \n\nWhile known for his brilliance, Edison was also infamous for his fierce competitiveness, especially with fellow inventor Nikola Tesla over the use of direct current (DC) versus alternating current (AC). This rivalry, known as the \"War of Currents,\" showed a side of Edison that was willing to go great lengths to ensure his ideas prevailed.\nChristopher: Can you differentiate between the scent of a rose and a lily?"
