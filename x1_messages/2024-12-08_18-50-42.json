That's quite a challenge! In English, most words contain consonants, but there are a few like \"A\", \"I\", and \"O\". Let's see if I can craft something:\n\nA hermit lived in a small, humble A,\nIn quiet solitude, just he and his IA.\nWith no need for O,\nHe lived simply, you know,\nIn this vowel-only domain, oh my A!\n\nHmm, that's a stretch, but perhaps it conveys the idea. The challenge is to use words like \"A\", \"I\", \"O\", which are vowels only, and build a limerick around them. It's not perfect, but it's a start."
