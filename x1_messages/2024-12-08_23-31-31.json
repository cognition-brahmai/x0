        "content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with different colored balls: 4 red, 6 blue, and 5 green. I need to find the probability that a ball drawn at random is not red. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the total number of balls in the bag. So, if there are 4 red, 6 blue, and 5 green, I can add those up to get the total.\n\nTotal balls = 4 (red) + 6 (blue) + 5 (green) = 15 balls.\n\nOkay, so there are 15 balls in total.\n\nNow, the probability of drawing a red ball would be the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls. So, probability of red is 4/15.\n\nBut the question is asking for the probability that the ball is not red. So, that would be all the other balls except the red ones.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of the event happening. So, P(not red) = 1 - P(red).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nP(red) = 4/15\n\nTherefore, P(not red) = 1 - 4/15 = (15/15 - 4/15) = 11/15.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to think about it?\n\nYes, I can also think about it by considering the number of favorable outcomes for not red. The favorable outcomes would be drawing either a blue or a green ball.\n\nSo, number of not red balls = number of blue balls + number of green balls = 6 + 5 = 11.\n\nThen, probability of not red = number of not red balls / total number of balls = 11/15.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also consider the probability of drawing a blue ball and the probability of drawing a green ball separately, then add them up.\n\nProbability of blue = 6/15\n\nProbability of green = 5/15\n\nSo, P(not red) = P(blue) + P(green) = 6/15 + 5/15 = 11/15.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, so it seems consistent. I can conclude that the probability of drawing a ball that is not red is 11/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{15}} \\]"
