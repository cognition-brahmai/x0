        "content": "Certainly! To merge two sorted lists into one sorted list in Python, you can use a two-pointer technique. This method is efficient because it iterates through both lists only once, making it O(n + m) in time complexity, where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, one for each list, initially set to 0.\n2. **Compare and Append**: Compare the elements at the current positions of the pointers. Append the smaller element to the result list and move the pointer of the list from which the element was taken.\n3. **Handle Remaining Elements**: After one list is exhausted, append the remaining elements of the other list to the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that the merged list is sorted because both input lists are sorted, and we always choose the smallest available element at each step.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo merge two sorted lists into one sorted list, you can use the following Python function:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize pointers for both lists\n    pointer1 = 0\n    pointer2 = 0\n    merged_list = []\n    \n    # Loop until one of the lists is exhausted\n    while pointer1 < len(list1) and pointer2 < len(list2):\n        if list1[pointer1] < list2[pointer2]:\n            merged_list.append(list1[pointer1])\n            pointer1 += 1\n        else:\n            merged_list.append(list2[pointer2])\n            pointer2 += 1\n    \n    # Append any remaining elements from list1\n    while pointer1 < len(list1):\n        merged_list.append(list1[pointer1])\n        pointer1 += 1\n    \n    # Append any remaining elements from list2\n    while pointer2 < len(list2):\n        merged_list.append(list2[pointer2])\n        pointer2 += 1\n    \n    return merged_list\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `pointer1` and `pointer2`, set to 0. These pointers track the current position in `list1` and `list2`, respectively.\n2. **Merging Process**:\n   - Compare the elements at `list1[pointer1]` and `list2[pointer2]`.\n   - Append the smaller element to `merged_list` and move the corresponding pointer forward.\n   - Repeat this process until one of the lists is exhausted.\n3. **Handling Remaining Elements**:\n   - After one list is exhausted, append all remaining elements from the other list to `merged_list`.\n4. **Return the Merged List**: The function returns `merged_list`, which contains all elements from both input lists in sorted order.\n\nThis method ensures that the merged list is sorted efficiently in O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively."
