        "content": "So the train is moving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 30 minutes to go from Station A to Station B. I need to find out how far apart these two stations are.\n\nFirst, I should remember the basic formula for distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSo, if the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 30 minutes, I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nBut wait, the time is in minutes, and the speed is in miles per hour. I need to make sure that the units are compatible. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour.\n\nSo, time = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 60 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 30 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, since the train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, that means it covers 60 miles in one hour. In half an hour, it would cover half of that distance, which is 30 miles.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the distance, like acceleration or something. The problem says the train travels at a constant speed, so no acceleration or deceleration is involved. That means we can rely on the simple distance formula.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the units are correctly converted. Since the speed is given in miles per hour and time in minutes, converting time to hours is the correct approach.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the proportion. If in 60 minutes the train travels 60 miles, then in 30 minutes it would travel half of that, which is again 30 miles.\n\nI can also use the formula for speed:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nRearranging for distance:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I keep getting 30 miles as the distance between Station A and Station B.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
