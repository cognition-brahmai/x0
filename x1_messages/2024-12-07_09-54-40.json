        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many girls and boys are currently in Grade 8.\n\nWe know that there are 120 students in total, and 30% of them are girls. So, to find the number of girls, we calculate 30% of 120.\n\nNumber of girls = 30% of 120 = 0.30 \u00d7 120 = 36 girls.\n\nNow, since the total number of students is 120 and there are 36 girls, the number of boys would be:\n\nNumber of boys = Total students - Number of girls = 120 - 36 = 84 boys.\n\nNext, the problem states that 5 more boys join the grade. So, the new number of boys will be:\n\nNew number of boys = 84 + 5 = 89 boys.\n\nThe number of girls remains the same, which is 36.\n\nNow, we need to find the new total number of students after the 5 boys join.\n\nNew total students = Number of girls + New number of boys = 36 + 89 = 125 students.\n\nFinally, we need to find the new percentage of girls in the grade.\n\nNew percentage of girls = (Number of girls / New total students) \u00d7 100 = (36 / 125) \u00d7 100.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n36 divided by 125 is 0.288.\n\nThen, 0.288 multiplied by 100 gives us 28.8%.\n\nSo, the new percentage of girls in Grade 8 is 28.8%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28.8\\%} \\]"
