        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a train that travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour and it takes 4 hours to reach its destination. First, I need to find out how far the destination is.\n\nDistance is calculated by multiplying speed by time, right? So, distance equals speed times time, or d = s * t. Plugging in the values, d = 60 miles per hour * 4 hours = 240 miles. So, the destination is 240 miles away.\n\nNow, the question says that if the train's speed were increased by 15 miles per hour, how long would it take to reach the same destination? So, the new speed would be the original speed plus 15 miles per hour, which is 60 + 15 = 75 miles per hour.\n\nNext, I need to find out the new time it would take to travel the same 240 miles at this new speed of 75 miles per hour. Time is calculated by dividing distance by speed, so t = d / s.\n\nPlugging in the new values, t = 240 miles / 75 miles per hour. Let me do this calculation: 240 divided by 75.\n\nWell, 75 times 3 is 225, which is less than 240. 75 times 4 is 300, which is more than 240. So, it's between 3 and 4 hours. Let's find out exactly.\n\n240 divided by 75: I can simplify this fraction. Both 240 and 75 are divisible by 15.\n\n240 divided by 15 is 16, and 75 divided by 15 is 5. So, 240 / 75 = 16 / 5.\n\n16 divided by 5 is 3.2. So, the new time is 3.2 hours.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nOriginal speed: 60 mph, time: 4 hours, distance: 60 * 4 = 240 miles.\n\nNew speed: 60 + 15 = 75 mph.\n\nTime = distance / speed = 240 / 75.\n\nYes, 240 / 75 = 3.2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in minutes. 3.2 hours is 3 hours plus 0.2 of an hour. Since 0.2 of an hour is 0.2 * 60 minutes = 12 minutes, so 3 hours and 12 minutes.\n\nBut the question probably expects the answer in hours, so 3.2 hours should be fine.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach: the original time is 4 hours at 60 mph.\n\nNew speed is 75 mph.\n\nThe ratio of new speed to original speed is 75 / 60 = 1.25.\n\nSince speed and time are inversely proportional (assuming distance is constant), the new time should be the original time divided by the speed ratio.\n\nSo, new time = original time / (new speed / original speed) = 4 / 1.25.\n\nLet's calculate that: 4 divided by 1.25.\n\nWell, 1.25 times 3.2 is 4, so yes, that also gives 3.2 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it: if the speed increases by 25% (from 60 to 75 mph is an increase of 15 mph, which is 15/60 = 0.25 or 25%), then the time should decrease by approximately 20%, because time and speed are inversely proportional.\n\nDecreasing 4 hours by 20%: 20% of 4 is 0.8, so 4 - 0.8 = 3.2 hours.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the new time is 3.2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
