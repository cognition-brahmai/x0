        "content": "So the runner completed a marathon in 4 hours and wants to improve his time by 10% in the next race. First, I need to figure out what 10% of 4 hours is and then subtract that from his original time to get the target time.\n\nLet me start by calculating 10% of 4 hours. Since 10% is the same as 0.1, I can multiply 4 hours by 0.1.\n\n4 hours * 0.1 = 0.4 hours\n\nNow, I need to subtract that from his original time.\n\n4 hours - 0.4 hours = 3.6 hours\n\nSo, his target time should be 3.6 hours. But maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nAlternatively, improving by 10% could mean running the same distance in 10% less time. So, again, that would be reducing his time by 10%, which aligns with the calculation I just did.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find what 90% of his original time is, since he's improving by 10%. Let's see:\n\n90% of 4 hours is 0.9 * 4 = 3.6 hours\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the target time is 3.6 hours.\n\nBut maybe I should consider whether this improvement is realistic for a runner. A 10% improvement in time is significant, but it depends on the runner's current fitness level and training. If he's already well-trained, achieving a 10% improvement might be challenging, but if he's new to marathons, it might be more achievable.\n\nAssuming he's capable of improving by 10%, then 3.6 hours is the target. But perhaps he should set a slightly more achievable goal to build confidence, like aiming for a 8% improvement instead.\n\nLet me calculate 8% of 4 hours.\n\n8% of 4 hours is 0.08 * 4 = 0.32 hours\n\nSubtract that from the original time: 4 - 0.32 = 3.68 hours\n\nSo, an 8% improvement would bring his time to 3.68 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he could aim for a time between 3.6 and 3.68 hours, like 3.65 hours, as a compromise between challenge and achievability.\n\nBut, considering he wants to improve by 10%, and assuming he can achieve that with proper training, 3.6 hours is the target he should aim for.\n\nPerhaps I should also consider the pace he needs to maintain to achieve this time. A marathon is 26.2 miles, so let's calculate his current pace and the target pace.\n\nCurrent time: 4 hours = 240 minutes\n\nCurrent pace: 240 minutes / 26.2 miles \u2248 9.16 minutes per mile\n\nTarget time: 3.6 hours = 216 minutes\n\nTarget pace: 216 minutes / 26.2 miles \u2248 8.25 minutes per mile\n\nSo, he needs to improve his pace from approximately 9:10 per mile to 8:15 per mile.\n\nThat's a noticeable improvement, but again, if he trains properly, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he should aim for a smaller improvement first, say 5%, to build confidence before aiming for the full 10%.\n\n5% of 4 hours is 0.2 hours, so 4 - 0.2 = 3.8 hours\n\nThat's 3 hours and 48 minutes, which might be easier to achieve.\n\nBut since his goal is to improve by 10%, perhaps he should set 3.6 hours as the target and work towards that.\n\nAnother factor to consider is his current training schedule and how much he's willing to push himself. If he's already training hard, an additional 10% improvement might require significantly more effort.\n\nMaybe he should consider a step-by-step approach: aim for a 5% improvement in the next race, then another 5% in the following race, to gradually reach his goal.\n\nBut if he's confident and willing to put in the extra work, going for the 10% improvement in one go is also an option.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the most achievable goal is to aim for the 10% improvement, but with a plan to adjust if needed based on his progress in training.\n\nSo, to sum up, his target time should be 3.6 hours, which is a 10% improvement from his current time of 4 hours.\n\nBut it's also important for him to monitor his training and adjust the goal if necessary.\n\nAlternatively, he could set a range for his target time, say between 3.6 and 3.7 hours, to account for any variables on race day.\n\nOverall, 3.6 hours is the target he should aim for, but being flexible and adjusting based on his training progress is also wise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.6 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
