        "content": "That sounds like it's related to exponents or powers in math. So, if you multiply a number by itself three times, that would be the number raised to the power of three. For example, 2 multiplied by itself three times is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, which equals 8. I think the term you're looking for might be \"cube\" because cubing a number means raising it to the third power. So, the cube of 2 is 8. Am I on the right track here?"
