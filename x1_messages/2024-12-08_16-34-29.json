        "content": "Alright, let's solve the equation 5x - 3 = 17 step by step. I'll explain each step so you can understand the process.\n\nOur goal is to find the value of x that makes the equation true. To do that, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Here's how we can do it:\n\nStep 1: Start with the equation as given.\n\n5x - 3 = 17\n\nStep 2: We want to get rid of the -3 on the left side so that we're left with just the term with x. To do this, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation. Remember, whatever we do to one side, we have to do to the other side to keep the equation balanced.\n\nSo, add 3 to both sides:\n\n5x - 3 + 3 = 17 + 3\n\nOn the left side, -3 and +3 cancel each other out, so we're left with:\n\n5x = 20\n\nStep 3: Now, we have 5x = 20. To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. Since x is being multiplied by 5, we can undo that by dividing both sides of the equation by 5.\n\nSo, divide both sides by 5:\n\n5x / 5 = 20 / 5\n\nOn the left side, 5 divided by 5 is 1, so we're left with:\n\nx = 4\n\nStep 4: To make sure our answer is correct, we can check it by plugging x = 4 back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: 5x - 3 = 17\n\nPlug in x = 4:\n\n5*(4) - 3 = 17\n\nCalculate:\n\n20 - 3 = 17\n\n17 = 17\n\nSince both sides are equal, our solution is correct.\n\nSo, the solution to the equation 5x - 3 = 17 is x = 4.\n\nI hope this step-by-step explanation helps you understand how to solve similar equations in the future. Let me know if you have any questions!"
