        "content": "Let's see. We have two trains here, one leaving from Station A at 9 AM going towards Station B at 60 km/h, and another leaving from Station B at 11 AM going towards Station A at 90 km/h. The total distance between the stations is 450 km. I need to find out when they'll meet.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how far the first train has traveled by the time the second train starts at 11 AM. The first train leaves at 9 AM, so by 11 AM, it's been traveling for 2 hours. Traveling at 60 km/h for 2 hours, it would have covered 120 km.\n\nSo, at 11 AM, the distance between the two trains is 450 km minus the 120 km that the first train has already covered, which is 330 km.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other, so their speeds will add up relative to each other. The first train is going at 60 km/h and the second at 90 km/h, so together they're approaching each other at 60 + 90 = 150 km/h.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to meet, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nSo, Time = 330 km / 150 km/h = 2.2 hours.\n\nNow, 2.2 hours is 2 hours and 0.2 of an hour. Since 0.2 hours is 0.2 * 60 minutes = 12 minutes, the total time is 2 hours and 12 minutes.\n\nSince the second train leaves at 11 AM, adding 2 hours and 12 minutes to that time, the trains will meet at 1:12 PM.\n\nWait, but I should confirm if that makes sense. Let's check the distances each train travels up to that meeting time.\n\nFrom 9 AM to 1:12 PM, the first train travels for 4 hours and 12 minutes. Converting 12 minutes to hours, it's 12/60 = 0.2 hours, so total time is 4.2 hours. At 60 km/h, the distance covered is 60 * 4.2 = 252 km.\n\nThe second train travels from 11 AM to 1:12 PM, which is 2 hours and 12 minutes, or 2.2 hours. At 90 km/h, the distance covered is 90 * 2.2 = 198 km.\n\nAdding these distances: 252 km + 198 km = 450 km, which matches the total distance between the stations. So, yes, they meet at 1:12 PM.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1:12 \\text{ PM}} \\]"
