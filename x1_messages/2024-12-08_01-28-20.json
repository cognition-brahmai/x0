        "content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a hotel trying to figure out their water consumption and see how they can save some water and money. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the hotel has 500 rooms, and on average, 80% of them are occupied. So, I need to find out how many rooms are actually being used each day. To do that, I'll multiply the total number of rooms by the occupancy rate.\n\nNumber of occupied rooms = Total rooms \u00d7 Occupancy rate\nNumber of occupied rooms = 500 \u00d7 0.80\nNumber of occupied rooms = 400\n\nSo, 400 rooms are occupied on average each day.\n\nNext, each guest uses an average of 75 gallons of water per day. Assuming each occupied room has one guest, the total daily water consumption would be the number of occupied rooms multiplied by the water usage per guest.\n\nTotal daily water consumption = Number of occupied rooms \u00d7 Water usage per guest\nTotal daily water consumption = 400 \u00d7 75\nTotal daily water consumption = 30,000 gallons\n\nOkay, so the hotel uses 30,000 gallons of water per day on average.\n\nNow, the hotel wants to see how much they can save if they reduce water usage by 10% through conservation measures. To find the potential savings, I need to calculate 10% of the total daily water consumption.\n\nPotential water savings = Total daily water consumption \u00d7 Reduction percentage\nPotential water savings = 30,000 \u00d7 0.10\nPotential water savings = 3,000 gallons\n\nSo, if the hotel can reduce water usage by 10%, they can save 3,000 gallons of water per day.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this a bit more. Is there any other factor I should consider? For example, are there any common areas like lobbies, restaurants, or pools that might also use water? The problem mentions that the water usage is for guest activities like showering, washing hands, and flushing toilets, which seems to be per guest per day. So, it appears that the calculation is focused on guest water usage only.\n\nHowever, in a real-world scenario, a hotel would also have water usage in common areas, laundry, landscaping, and other operations. But based on the information provided, it seems we're only considering the guest usage.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"each guest uses an average of 75 gallons of water per day.\" If some rooms have multiple guests, that could affect the total water usage. But again, the problem assumes one guest per room, or at least doesn't specify otherwise, so I'll stick with the given information.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that water rates vary by location, so the cost savings would depend on the cost per gallon of water in that specific area. But since the problem doesn't provide that information, I'll focus on the water usage itself.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Calculate the number of occupied rooms: 500 rooms \u00d7 80% occupancy = 400 rooms.\n\n2. Calculate total daily water consumption: 400 rooms \u00d7 75 gallons per guest per day = 30,000 gallons.\n\n3. Calculate potential water savings with a 10% reduction: 30,000 gallons \u00d7 10% = 3,000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the hotel can potentially save 3,000 gallons of water per day by reducing usage by 10%.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it's always good to double-check the calculations and assumptions to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30000 \\text{ gallons per day, with potential savings of } 3000 \\text{ gallons per day}} \\]"
