        "content": "So the factory is currently making 500 units every day, right? And they want to increase that by 10% because there's more demand for their product. I need to figure out how many units they'll produce after this increase.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a 10% increase means. Percentage increases are based on the original amount, so I need to calculate 10% of 500 units and then add that to the original 500 units.\n\nLet me recall how to calculate percentages. To find 10% of a number, I can multiply that number by 0.10. So, 10% of 500 units would be 500 multiplied by 0.10.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 500 \u00d7 0.10 = 50 units.\n\nSo, the increase is 50 units. Now, to find the total production after the increase, I need to add this increase to the original production.\n\nThat would be 500 units + 50 units = 550 units.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 500 units, 10% of 500 is indeed 50 units. Adding that to the original amount gives 550 units. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the new amount by multiplying the original amount by (1 + the percentage increase). In this case, that would be 500 \u00d7 (1 + 0.10) = 500 \u00d7 1.10.\n\nLet me try that: 500 \u00d7 1.10 = 550 units. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer: 550 units.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using fractions?\n\nI know that 10% is the same as 1/10. So, 1/10 of 500 is 50 units. Adding that to 500 gives 550 units again.\n\nAlright, no matter how I approach it, I keep getting 550 units as the answer.\n\nI think I can confidently say that after a 10% increase, the factory will produce 550 units daily.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{550} \\]"
