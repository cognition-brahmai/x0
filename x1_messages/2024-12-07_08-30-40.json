        "content": "Let's see. I started with 12 apples in the basket. Then I took away 5 apples, so that leaves me with 12 - 5 = 7 apples. After that, I added 3 more apples, so now I have 7 + 3 = 10 apples.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more apples I need to add to have twice as many apples as I started with. I started with 12 apples, so twice that amount would be 2 * 12 = 24 apples.\n\nI currently have 10 apples in the basket, and I need to have 24 apples. So, the number of apples I need to add is 24 - 10 = 14 apples.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I started with 12 apples, took away 5, which leaves 7, then added 3, which makes 10. Twice the original amount is 24, so 24 - 10 = 14 apples needed. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this. Let's try setting up an equation.\n\nLet x be the number of apples I need to add to the current amount to have twice the original amount.\n\nI started with 12 apples, took away 5, added 3, and now have 10 apples.\n\nSo, 10 + x = 2 * 12\n\n10 + x = 24\n\nThen, x = 24 - 10\n\nx = 14\n\nSame answer. Okay, I'm confident now.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
