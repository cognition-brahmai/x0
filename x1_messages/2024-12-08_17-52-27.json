        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a survey that says 60% of people prefer apples over oranges, and 40% prefer oranges. Then, if we randomly select a group of 10 people, we need to find the probability that exactly 7 people prefer apples and 3 people prefer oranges.\n\nOkay, first things first, this seems like a binomial probability problem. Binomial because there are two possible outcomes for each person: prefers apples or prefers oranges. And we're dealing with a fixed number of trials, which is 10 people.\n\nIn binomial probability, the formula to find the probability of exactly k successes in n trials is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\n- n is the number of trials.\n\n- k is the number of successes.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- n = 10 (since there are 10 people).\n\n- k = 7 (since we want exactly 7 people to prefer apples).\n\n- p = 0.60 (since 60% prefer apples).\n\n- (1-p) = 0.40 (since 40% prefer oranges).\n\nSo plugging these values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * (0.60)^7 * (0.40)^3\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(10, 7). The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nSo:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!)\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 3,628,800\n\n7! = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 5,040\n\n3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\nTherefore:\n\nC(10, 7) = 3,628,800 / (5,040 * 6) = 3,628,800 / 30,240 = 120\n\nNow, calculate (0.60)^7:\n\n0.60^7 = 0.60 \u00d7 0.60 \u00d7 0.60 \u00d7 0.60 \u00d7 0.60 \u00d7 0.60 \u00d7 0.60\n\nLet's compute this step by step:\n\n0.60 \u00d7 0.60 = 0.36\n\n0.36 \u00d7 0.60 = 0.216\n\n0.216 \u00d7 0.60 = 0.1296\n\n0.1296 \u00d7 0.60 = 0.07776\n\n0.07776 \u00d7 0.60 = 0.046656\n\n0.046656 \u00d7 0.60 = 0.0279936\n\nSo, (0.60)^7 \u2248 0.0279936\n\nNext, calculate (0.40)^3:\n\n0.40 \u00d7 0.40 \u00d7 0.40 = 0.064\n\nNow, put it all together:\n\nP(X = 7) = 120 \u00d7 0.0279936 \u00d7 0.064\n\nFirst, multiply 120 by 0.0279936:\n\n120 \u00d7 0.0279936 = 3.359232\n\nThen, multiply that by 0.064:\n\n3.359232 \u00d7 0.064 = 0.214990848\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.215 or 21.5%.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting over:\n\nC(10, 7) = 120 (as before)\n\n(0.60)^7 \u2248 0.0279936\n\n(0.40)^3 = 0.064\n\nNow, 120 \u00d7 0.0279936 = 3.359232\n\nThen, 3.359232 \u00d7 0.064 = 0.214990848\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the binomial coefficient formula directly in some calculators, or use software to compute it, but since we're doing it manually, this should suffice.\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 7 out of 10 people prefer apples and 3 prefer oranges is approximately 21.5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.215} \\]"
