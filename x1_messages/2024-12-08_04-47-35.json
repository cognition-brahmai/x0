        "content": "So the farmer has 5 different types of fruits: apples, oranges, bananas, grapes, and strawberries. He wants to create fruit baskets that contain exactly 3 types of these fruits. He's wondering how many unique combinations of these fruits he can put in each basket.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. The order in which we pick the fruits doesn't matter here because it's about combinations, not permutations. So, whether I pick apples first and then oranges, or oranges first and then apples, it's still the same combination in the basket.\n\nIn mathematics, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order of selection is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\n- \\( k! \\) is the factorial of k.\n\n- \\( (n - k)! \\) is the factorial of (n - k).\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (the total number of fruit types), and k = 3 (the number of fruit types in each basket).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3! \\times 2!}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n- 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n\n- 3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\n- 2! = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n\nNow, substitute these back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 3) = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 unique combinations of 3 fruits that the farmer can put in each basket.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure we're correct. Maybe I can list them all out to verify.\n\nThe fruits are: apples (A), oranges (O), bananas (B), grapes (G), and strawberries (S).\n\nPossible combinations of 3 fruits:\n\n1. A, O, B\n\n2. A, O, G\n\n3. A, O, S\n\n4. A, B, G\n\n5. A, B, S\n\n6. A, G, S\n\n7. O, B, G\n\n8. O, B, S\n\n9. O, G, S\n\n10. B, G, S\n\nOkay, that's 10 combinations, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it another way. For the first fruit, there are 5 options. For the second fruit, there are 4 remaining options, and for the third fruit, there are 3 remaining options. So, that would be 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\nBut wait, that's permutations because it considers the order. Since the order doesn't matter in our case, we need to adjust for that. To get the number of combinations, we need to divide this by the number of ways to arrange 3 fruits, which is 3! = 6.\n\nSo, 60 divided by 6 equals 10, which again confirms our initial calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the combination formula iteratively. For example, choosing 3 fruits out of 5 is the same as choosing which 2 fruits to leave out, because 5 - 3 = 2.\n\nSo, C(5, 3) = C(5, 2). Let's calculate C(5, 2):\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nAgain, we get 10.\n\nAlternatively, if the farmer wants to ensure that each basket has distinct types of fruits and no repetition, then our initial calculation holds true.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if repetition is allowed. For example, could a basket have two apples and one orange? But according to the problem, each basket should have exactly 3 types of fruits, so repetition of the same type isn't allowed. Hence, our initial approach is correct.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"unique combinations,\" which again points to combinations without repetition.\n\nTherefore, the farmer can make 10 unique fruit baskets, each containing 3 different types of fruits from the 5 available types.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
