        "content": "Let's see. There are 10 red balls and 20 blue balls in the bag, so total balls are 10 + 20 = 30 balls.\n\nI need to find the probability that both balls picked are red, without replacement. That means once I pick the first ball, it doesn't go back into the bag, so the total number of balls decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nFirst, I'll find the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw.\n\nProbability of first ball being red = number of red balls / total number of balls = 10/30 = 1/3.\n\nNow, since I don't replace the first ball, the total number of balls left is 29, and the number of red balls left is 9.\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red ball on the second draw, given that the first was red, is 9/29.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, I need to multiply the probabilities together.\n\nSo, probability of both balls being red = (10/30) * (9/29).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 10/30 simplifies to 1/3.\n\nThen, 1/3 * 9/29 = (1*9)/(3*29) = 9/87.\n\nNow, 9 and 87 can both be divided by 3.\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3, and 87 \u00f7 3 = 29.\n\nSo, 9/87 simplifies to 3/29.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls picked are red is 3/29.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{29}} \\]"
