        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 5 cats and 3 dogs in a room, and we need to figure out how many of those dogs have 3 legs, given that the total number of legs is 31.\n\nFirst, let's establish what we know for sure:\n\n1. Each cat has 4 legs.\n\n2. Each dog has either 3 or 4 legs.\n\n3. There are 5 cats and 3 dogs.\n\n4. The total number of legs is 31.\n\nSo, let's start by calculating the total number of legs contributed by the cats alone. Since there are 5 cats and each has 4 legs:\n\n5 cats * 4 legs/cat = 20 legs\n\nNow, that means the dogs must account for the remaining legs. If the total is 31 legs, and the cats account for 20, then:\n\n31 total legs - 20 legs from cats = 11 legs from dogs\n\nSo, the 3 dogs together have 11 legs.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many of these dogs have 3 legs and how many have 4 legs. Let's denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of dogs with 3 legs.\n\n- Let y be the number of dogs with 4 legs.\n\nWe know that the total number of dogs is 3, so:\n\nx + y = 3\n\nAnd the total number of legs from the dogs is 11, so:\n\n3x + 4y = 11\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. x + y = 3\n\n2. 3x + 4y = 11\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of x and y.\n\nFirst, from equation 1:\n\nx = 3 - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into equation 2:\n\n3(3 - y) + 4y = 11\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n9 - 3y + 4y = 11\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n9 + y = 11\n\nNow, subtract 9 from both sides:\n\ny = 2\n\nNow that we have y, which is the number of dogs with 4 legs, we can find x, the number of dogs with 3 legs, using equation 1:\n\nx + 2 = 3\n\nSo:\n\nx = 1\n\nTherefore, there is 1 dog with 3 legs and 2 dogs with 4 legs.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this to make sure it adds up correctly.\n\nWe have 5 cats with 4 legs each: 5 * 4 = 20 legs\n\n1 dog with 3 legs: 1 * 3 = 3 legs\n\n2 dogs with 4 legs each: 2 * 4 = 8 legs\n\nTotal legs: 20 + 3 + 8 = 31 legs\n\nYes, that matches the total given.\n\nSo, the answer is that there is 1 dog with 3 legs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
