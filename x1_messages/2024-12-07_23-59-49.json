Each plan will correlate with an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string that can be the user question, past evidence values, or both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be used:\nAskJeeves[input]: A tool that allows the user to search for information on Ask Jeeves. This tool is beneficial in finding a list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's question.\nSiteReader[input]: Reads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-separated links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nLinkMiner[input]: Mines links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline separated response of links.\nMLQA[input]: Machine Learning-based Question Answering model, specifically useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that refers to a :fact[n]: variable, e.g., What is the distance between Earth and Mars, given :fact1:?\n\nEach function input should just be a plain string, without quotes or \"+\" to combine a string with an evidence variable, e.g., MLQA[What is the GDP of India, given :fact2:?]\n\nBe sure to include only one evidence output per plan step.\n\nThe output should be in this format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:fact0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :fact0:]\n:fact1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :fact0\"]\n...\nFinal Answer: [:fact[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What are the primary causes of global warming and what steps can individuals take to mitigate its effects?"
