        "content": "To develop a Python program that reads text from a file and performs sentiment analysis using the TextBlob library, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install TextBlob**: If you haven't already installed the TextBlob library, you can do so using pip.\n\n2. **Read Text from a File**: Open and read the content from a text file.\n\n3. **Perform Sentiment Analysis**: Use TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of the text.\n\n4. **Output the Results**: Print the sentiment polarity and subjectivity scores.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide with code snippets:\n\n### Step 1: Install TextBlob\n\nFirst, ensure that you have TextBlob installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install textblob\n```\n\n### Step 2: Read Text from a File\n\nAssume you have a text file named `input.txt`. You need to read the content from this file.\n\n```python\ndef read_text_from_file(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n        text = file.read()\n    return text\n```\n\n### Step 3: Perform Sentiment Analysis\n\nUse TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of the text. TextBlob provides a `sentiment` property that returns a namedtuple of the form `Sentiment(polarity, subjectivity)`.\n\n```python\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n\ndef analyze_sentiment(text):\n    blob = TextBlob(text)\n    sentiment = blob.sentiment\n    return sentiment.polarity, sentiment.subjectivity\n```\n\n### Step 4: Output the Results\n\nPrint the sentiment polarity and subjectivity scores.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    file_path = 'input.txt'\n    text = read_text_from_file(file_path)\n    polarity, subjectivity = analyze_sentiment(text)\n    print(f'Sentiment Polarity: {polarity}')\n    print(f'Sentiment Subjectivity: {subjectivity}')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Complete Program\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete Python program:\n\n```python\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n\ndef read_text_from_file(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n        text = file.read()\n    return text\n\ndef analyze_sentiment(text):\n    blob = TextBlob(text)\n    sentiment = blob.sentiment\n    return sentiment.polarity, sentiment.subjectivity\n\ndef main():\n    file_path = 'input.txt'\n    text = read_text_from_file(file_path)\n    polarity, subjectivity = analyze_sentiment(text)\n    print(f'Sentiment Polarity: {polarity}')\n    print(f'Sentiment Subjectivity: {subjectivity}')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Sentiment Polarity**: This score lies between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates negative sentiment, 0 indicates neutral sentiment, and 1 indicates positive sentiment.\n- **Sentiment Subjectivity**: This score lies between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates objective/ factual text and 1 indicates subjective/ opinionated text.\n\nMake sure that the file `input.txt` exists in the same directory as your Python script, or provide the correct path to the file. This program will read the text from the file, perform sentiment analysis using TextBlob, and print the polarity and subjectivity scores."
