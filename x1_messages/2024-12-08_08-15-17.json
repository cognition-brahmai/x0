        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 5 cats and 7 dogs in a room. Each cat has 3 toys, and each dog has 2 toys. We need to find the probability that a randomly selected toy belongs to a cat.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of toys in the room. Since there are 5 cats and each has 3 toys, the total number of toys for cats is 5 times 3, which is 15 toys. Similarly, there are 7 dogs, each with 2 toys, so the total number of toys for dogs is 7 times 2, which is 14 toys.\n\nNow, the total number of toys in the room is the sum of the toys belonging to cats and dogs, which is 15 plus 14, equaling 29 toys.\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected toy is a cat's toy. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcomes are the toys that belong to cats, which are 15, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of toys, which is 29.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected toy belongs to a cat is 15 divided by 29.\n\nTo express this as a fraction, it's simply 15/29. If we want to express it as a decimal, we can divide 15 by 29, which is approximately 0.5172. To express it as a percentage, we can multiply the decimal by 100, which is approximately 51.72%.\n\nSo, the probability is 15/29, or approximately 51.72%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, number of cat toys: 5 cats times 3 toys each equals 15 toys.\n\nNumber of dog toys: 7 dogs times 2 toys each equals 14 toys.\n\nTotal toys: 15 plus 14 equals 29 toys.\n\nProbability of selecting a cat's toy: 15 divided by 29.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of proportions. The proportion of cat toys in the room is 15 out of 29, which is indeed 15/29.\n\nSimilarly, the proportion of dog toys is 14 out of 29, which is 14/29.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a cat's toy is 15/29.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{29}} \\]"
