        "content": "So, there are 10 people in the room who always tell the truth, and some unknown number of liars who always lie. You ask everyone if they are a liar, and you want to know how many people will say \"yes\" to that question.\n\nFirst, let's think about what each group would say when asked if they are a liar.\n\n1. **Truth-tellers**: These are the 10 people who always tell the truth. So, if you ask them \"Are you a liar?\", they will truthfully say \"no\" because they are not liars.\n\n2. **Liars**: These are the people who always lie. So, if you ask them \"Are you a liar?\", they will lie about being a liar. Since they are liars, the truthful answer would be \"yes\", but because they lie, they will say \"no\".\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me rephrase it.\n\n- A truth-teller is asked \"Are you a liar?\" They tell the truth, so they say \"no\".\n\n- A liar is asked \"Are you a liar?\" They lie about being a liar. Since they are liars, the truth is \"yes\", but they lie, so they say \"no\".\n\nWait a minute, that means both truth-tellers and liars say \"no\" to the question \"Are you a liar?\". So, no one should say \"yes\"?\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem because the question is asking how many people will say \"yes\". According to this, everyone would say \"no\", regardless of whether they are truth-tellers or liars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that liars might answer differently.\n\nLet me think again.\n\n- Truth-tellers always tell the truth. So, if asked \"Are you a liar?\", they will say \"no\" because they are not liars.\n\n- Liars always lie. So, if asked \"Are you a liar?\", they will lie about their status. Since they are liars, the truth is \"yes\", but they lie, so they say \"no\".\n\nTherefore, both groups say \"no\". So, no one should say \"yes\".\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest that there is an unknown number of liars, and I need to find out how many people say \"yes\". According to my reasoning, it should be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that liars might say \"yes\" as a lie.\n\nWait, no. If a liar is asked \"Are you a liar?\", and the truth is \"yes\", but they lie, they would say \"no\". So, still, they say \"no\".\n\nAnother angle: maybe the liars are so consistent in their lying that they would say \"yes\" to the question \"Are you a liar?\", implying that they are admitting to lying, which contradicts their nature.\n\nBut no, if they say \"yes\", that would be telling the truth, which they cannot do because they always lie. So, they cannot say \"yes\" because that would make them truth-tellers, which contradicts their nature.\n\nTherefore, liars must say \"no\" to avoid telling the truth.\n\nSo, in conclusion, everyone in the room, whether a truth-teller or a liar, will say \"no\" to the question \"Are you a liar?\". Therefore, the number of people who will say \"yes\" is zero.\n\nBut perhaps there's a twist here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility that a liar would say \"yes\". Suppose a liar is asked \"Are you a liar?\", and they lie about it. If they say \"yes\", that would actually be the truth, which contradicts their nature of always lying. Therefore, they cannot say \"yes\" without contradicting their own nature.\n\nSimilarly, if they say \"no\", that would be a lie, which aligns with their nature of always lying.\n\nTherefore, all liars must say \"no\", and all truth-tellers say \"no\". So, no one says \"yes\".\n\nHence, the answer should be that zero people will say \"yes\".\n\nBut maybe the problem is trying to test something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some logical systems, liars can say \"yes\" without contradicting their nature, but in classical logic, where liars always lie and truth-tellers always tell the truth, the conclusion remains that no one says \"yes\".\n\nSo, I think the answer is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
