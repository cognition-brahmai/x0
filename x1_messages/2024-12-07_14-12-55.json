        "content": "Alright, I'm going to design a simple bank account class in C#. This class should allow users to deposit and withdraw money and keep track of the current balance. I need to make sure that I handle errors properly, especially when someone tries to withdraw more money than what's available in the account.\n\nFirst, I'll start by defining the class and its properties. The main property will be the balance, which should be private to encapsulate the data and control how it's modified. I'll provide public methods for depositing and withdrawing money.\n\nHere's a basic structure:\n\n```csharp\npublic class BankAccount\n{\n    private decimal balance;\n\n    public BankAccount()\n    {\n        balance = 0;\n    }\n\n    public void Deposit(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount < 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative.\");\n        }\n        balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount < 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.\");\n        }\n        if (amount > balance)\n        {\n            throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n        }\n        balance -= amount;\n    }\n\n    public decimal GetBalance()\n    {\n        return balance;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n\n- The `balance` is a private decimal to store the account balance.\n\n- The constructor initializes the balance to zero.\n\n- The `Deposit` method adds money to the balance. It checks if the deposit amount is negative and throws an `ArgumentException` if it is.\n\n- The `Withdraw` method subtracts money from the balance. It checks if the withdrawal amount is negative or greater than the current balance and throws appropriate exceptions.\n\n- The `GetBalance` method returns the current balance.\n\nThis is a straightforward implementation, but I can make it even better by adding some validation and perhaps using properties for balance if needed. However, since balance should be read-only from outside, exposing it through a property makes sense.\n\nLet me refactor it to use a public property for balance:\n\n```csharp\npublic class BankAccount\n{\n    private decimal balance;\n\n    public decimal Balance\n    {\n        get { return balance; }\n    }\n\n    public BankAccount()\n    {\n        balance = 0;\n    }\n\n    public void Deposit(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount < 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative.\");\n        }\n        balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount < 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.\");\n        }\n        if (amount > balance)\n        {\n            throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n        }\n        balance -= amount;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, the balance is exposed through a read-only property, which is safer.\n\nI should also consider thread safety if this class might be accessed concurrently, but for simplicity, I'll assume single-threaded access for now.\n\nAdditionally, it might be useful to have some methods that return the result of operations, but for this basic implementation, throwing exceptions is sufficient.\n\nLet me test this class with some scenarios to ensure it works as expected.\n\n1. Creating a new account and checking the balance:\n\n```csharp\nBankAccount account = new BankAccount();\nConsole.WriteLine(account.Balance); // Should print 0\n```\n\n2. Depositing money:\n\n```csharp\naccount.Deposit(100);\nConsole.WriteLine(account.Balance); // Should print 100\n```\n\n3. Withdrawing money:\n\n```csharp\naccount.Withdraw(50);\nConsole.WriteLine(account.Balance); // Should print 50\n```\n\n4. Trying to withdraw more than the balance:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    account.Withdraw(100);\n}\ncatch (InvalidOperationException ex)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); // Should print \"Insufficient funds.\"\n}\n```\n\n5. Trying to deposit a negative amount:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    account.Deposit(-50);\n}\ncatch (ArgumentException ex)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); // Should print \"Deposit amount cannot be negative.\"\n}\n```\n\n6. Trying to withdraw a negative amount:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    account.Withdraw(-50);\n}\ncatch (ArgumentException ex)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); // Should print \"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.\"\n}\n```\n\nAll these scenarios should be handled correctly by the class.\n\nI think this is a solid basic implementation of a bank account class in C#. It encapsulates the balance, provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money, and handles errors appropriately.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a simple bank account class in C#, we need to ensure that it can handle depositing and withdrawing money while maintaining the current balance and handling errors appropriately, such as preventing withdrawals that exceed the current balance.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Encapsulation**: Use private fields to store the balance and provide public methods to interact with it.\n2. **Methods**:\n   - `Deposit(decimal amount)`: Adds money to the balance, ensuring the amount is non-negative.\n   - `Withdraw(decimal amount)`: Subtracts money from the balance, ensuring the amount is non-negative and does not exceed the current balance.\n3. **Error Handling**: Throw appropriate exceptions for invalid operations.\n4. **Balance Retrieval**: Provide a read-only property to get the current balance.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```csharp\npublic class BankAccount\n{\n    private decimal balance;\n\n    public decimal Balance\n    {\n        get { return balance; }\n    }\n\n    public BankAccount()\n    {\n        balance = 0;\n    }\n\n    public void Deposit(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount < 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Deposit amount cannot be negative.\");\n        }\n        balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)\n    {\n        if (amount < 0)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.\");\n        }\n        if (amount > balance)\n        {\n            throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Insufficient funds.\");\n        }\n        balance -= amount;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Balance Property**: A read-only property to access the current balance.\n- **Constructor**: Initializes the balance to zero.\n- **Deposit Method**: Adds the specified amount to the balance, throwing an exception if the amount is negative.\n- **Withdraw Method**: Subtracts the specified amount from the balance, throwing exceptions if the amount is negative or if there are insufficient funds.\n\nThis implementation ensures basic bank account operations are handled safely and efficiently."
