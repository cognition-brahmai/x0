        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! So, the edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. The operations allowed are insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character. This problem is often solved using dynamic programming because it breaks down into smaller subproblems that can be built upon.\n\nI'll write a TypeScript function that takes two strings as input and returns their edit distance. I'll explain the steps as we go along.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basics of dynamic programming for this problem. We'll create a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the edit distance between the first i characters of the first string and the first j characters of the second string.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the DP Table:**\n   - Create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(str1.length + 1) x (str2.length + 1)`.\n   - Initialize the first row and the first column based on the idea that the edit distance between a string and an empty string is the length of the string.\n\n2. **Fill the DP Table:**\n   - For each character in `str1` and `str2`, compare them:\n     - If they are the same, the edit distance remains the same as without these characters.\n     - If they are different, consider the three operations (insert, delete, substitute) and take the minimum value plus one.\n\n3. **Return the Result:**\n   - The value in `dp[str1.length][str2.length]` will be the edit distance.\n\nNow, let's translate this into code.\n\n```typescript\nfunction editDistance(str1: string, str2: string): number {\n    const m = str1.length;\n    const n = str2.length;\n    \n    // Create a 2D array initialized to 0\n    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({length: m + 1}, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));\n    \n    // Initialize the first row and first column\n    for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {\n        dp[i][0] = i;\n    }\n    for (let j = 0; j <= n; j++) {\n        dp[0][j] = j;\n    }\n    \n    // Fill the dp table\n    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {\n        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n            if (str1[i - 1] === str2[j - 1]) {\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];\n            } else {\n                dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(\n                    dp[i - 1][j],    // Delete\n                    dp[i][j - 1],    // Insert\n                    dp[i - 1][j - 1] // Substitute\n                );\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return dp[m][n];\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst str1 = \"kitten\";\nconst str2 = \"sitting\";\nconsole.log(`The edit distance between \"${str1}\" and \"${str2}\" is ${editDistance(str1, str2)}`);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **DP Table Initialization:**\n   - `dp[i][0] = i`: The edit distance between the first `i` characters of `str1` and an empty string is `i` (delete operations).\n   - `dp[0][j] = j`: Similarly, the edit distance between an empty string and the first `j` characters of `str2` is `j`.\n\n2. **Filling the DP Table:**\n   - If characters `str1[i-1]` and `str2[j-1]` are the same, no operation is needed, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.\n   - If they are different, we take the minimum of:\n     - Delete operation: `dp[i-1][j]`\n     - Insert operation: `dp[i][j-1]`\n     - Substitute operation: `dp[i-1][j-1]`\n   - Add 1 to the minimum value obtained above.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The bottom-right cell `dp[m][n]` contains the edit distance between the two full strings.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the edit distance using dynamic programming, avoiding redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in the `dp` table."
