        "content": "The term 'Renaissance' indeed comes from the French word meaning 'rebirth,' and it refers to a period of significant cultural, artistic, political, and scientific awakening in Europe. This era is generally considered to have spanned from the 14th to the 17th century, marking a transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. The Renaissance began in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, bringing about profound changes in art, architecture, politics, science, and human thought."
