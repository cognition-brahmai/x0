        "content": "I'm excited to help you with this Java program that involves multithreading to calculate sums and products of Fibonacci numbers based on their parity. This sounds like a great way to explore threading in Java while working with an interesting mathematical sequence.\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements:\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: We need to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit.\n2. **Even and Odd Fibonacci Numbers**: We need to separate these numbers into even and odd categories.\n3. **Sum of Even Fibonacci Numbers**: One thread will calculate the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers up to the limit.\n4. **Product of Odd Fibonacci Numbers**: Another thread will calculate the product of all odd Fibonacci numbers up to the same limit.\n5. **Multithreading**: We need to perform these calculations simultaneously using threads.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Generate Fibonacci Sequence**: Create a method to generate Fibonacci numbers up to the given limit.\n2. **Thread for Sum of Evens**: Create a thread that sums up the even Fibonacci numbers.\n3. **Thread for Product of Odds**: Create another thread that calculates the product of odd Fibonacci numbers.\n4. **Synchronization**: Ensure that both threads access the Fibonacci sequence safely, possibly using synchronization mechanisms to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```java\nclass FibonacciCalculator {\n    private int limit;\n    private List<Integer> fibSequence;\n\n    public FibonacciCalculator(int limit) {\n        this.limit = limit;\n        this.fibSequence = generateFibonacci();\n    }\n\n    private List<Integer> generateFibonacci() {\n        List<Integer> sequence = new ArrayList<>();\n        int a = 0, b = 1;\n        while (a <= limit) {\n            sequence.add(a);\n            int next = a + b;\n            a = b;\n            b = next;\n        }\n        return sequence;\n    }\n\n    public void calculateSumAndProduct() {\n        List<Integer> evenFibs = new ArrayList<>();\n        List<Integer> oddFibs = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        for (int num : fibSequence) {\n            if (num % 2 == 0) {\n                evenFibs.add(num);\n            } else {\n                oddFibs.add(num);\n            }\n        }\n\n        SumThread sumThread = new SumThread(evenFibs);\n        ProductThread productThread = new ProductThread(oddFibs);\n\n        sumThread.start();\n        productThread.start();\n\n        try {\n            sumThread.join();\n            productThread.join();\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Sum of even Fibonacci numbers: \" + sumThread.getSum());\n        System.out.println(\"Product of odd Fibonacci numbers: \" + productThread.getProduct());\n    }\n\n    private class SumThread extends Thread {\n        private List<Integer> evenFibs;\n        private int sum;\n\n        public SumThread(List<Integer> evenFibs) {\n            this.evenFibs = evenFibs;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            for (int num : evenFibs) {\n                sum += num;\n            }\n        }\n\n        public int getSum() {\n            return sum;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private class ProductThread extends Thread {\n        private List<Integer> oddFibs;\n        private long product;\n\n        public ProductThread(List<Integer> oddFibs) {\n            this.oddFibs = oddFibs;\n            this.product = 1; // Start with 1 for multiplication\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            for (int num : oddFibs) {\n                product *= num;\n            }\n        }\n\n        public long getProduct() {\n            return product;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int limit = 100; // Example limit\n        FibonacciCalculator calculator = new FibonacciCalculator(limit);\n        calculator.calculateSumAndProduct();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**:\n   - The `generateFibonacci` method creates the Fibonacci sequence up to the given limit.\n\n2. **Separation into Even and Odd**:\n   - We iterate through the Fibonacci sequence and categorize numbers into even and odd lists.\n\n3. **Multithreading**:\n   - `SumThread` calculates the sum of even Fibonacci numbers.\n   - `ProductThread` calculates the product of odd Fibonacci numbers.\n   - Both threads are started and joined to ensure their completions before printing the results.\n\n4. **Main Method**:\n   - Sets the limit and creates an instance of `FibonacciCalculator`.\n   - Calls `calculateSumAndProduct` to perform the calculations.\n\nThis approach ensures that the sum and product calculations are performed concurrently, taking advantage of multithreading in Java."
