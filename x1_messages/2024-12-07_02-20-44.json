It helps in identifying potential sites that might contain the answer to the user's question.\nWebScraper[input]: Loads one or more websites from the input string containing newline-separated links, where input is one or more links, producing plain text output with the content of the links.\nHyperlinkHarvester[input]: Harvests hyperlinks from plain text and outputs a plain text, newline-separated response of links.\nBotQA[input]: Question-answering bot particularly adept at answering queries based on an input text passage. The input needs to be a textual question referencing a :info[n]: variable.\n\nEach function requires a plain string as input, devoid of quotes or \"+\" used to concatenate a string with an info variable, e.g., BotQA[Who won the 2020 US Presidential Election, given :info2:?]\n\nEnsure each plan step includes just one evidence output.\n\nOutput format should be:\nPlan: [initial action based on input question]\n:info0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [subsequent action based on outcome of :info0:]\n:info1: = [next function to call and input parameter, possibly referring to previous evidence]\n...\nAnswer: [:info[n]: holding the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who is the current President of Microsoft and what major contributions have they made to the company?"

        "content": "Alright, I need to find out who the current President of Microsoft is and what major contributions they've made to the company. I don't know this off the top of my head, so I'll need to look it up.\n\nFirst, I should probably search the web to find out who the current President of Microsoft is. I can use the DuckDuckGo search tool for this. So, I'll input the question \"Who is the current President of Microsoft?\" into DuckDuckGo.\n\nOnce I have the name, I'll need to find information about their major contributions to the company. Maybe I can use the WebScraper tool to extract information from relevant websites that come up in the search results.\n\nAlternatively, after finding the name, I could use the HyperlinkHarvester to collect more links related to that person and then scrape those for more detailed information.\n\nFinally, I can use the BotQA tool to summarize the information and provide a concise answer based on the data I've gathered.\n\nLet me outline this step by step.\n\nPlan: Search for the current President of Microsoft using DuckDuckGo.\n\n:info0: = DuckDuckGo[Who is the current President of Microsoft?]\n\nPlan: Extract the name from the search results. Assuming the first result is accurate, I'll note the name.\n\nPlan: Use HyperlinkHarvester to find more links related to this person.\n\n:info1: = HyperlinkHarvester[:info0:]\n\nPlan: Scrape the content from these links to gather information about the person's contributions to Microsoft.\n\n:info2: = WebScraper[:info1:]\n\nPlan: Use BotQA to answer the question based on the scraped information.\n\n:info3: = BotQA[Who is the current President of Microsoft and what major contributions have they made to the company, given :info2:?]\n\nAnswer: :info3:\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can make this more efficient. Instead of harvesting hyperlinks and then scraping them, perhaps I can directly scrape the top search results from DuckDuckGo.\n\nLet me see.\n\nPlan: Search for the current President of Microsoft using DuckDuckGo.\n\n:info0: = DuckDuckGo[Who is the current President of Microsoft?]\n\nPlan: Scrape the top search results for information.\n\n:info1: = WebScraper[:info0:]\n\nPlan: Use BotQA to extract the name and major contributions from the scraped data.\n\n:info2: = BotQA[Who is the current President of Microsoft and what major contributions have they made to the company, given :info1:?]\n\nAnswer: :info2:\n\nThis seems simpler. I'll go with this approach.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\n1. Use DuckDuckGo to search for \"Who is the current President of Microsoft?\"\n   - :info0: = DuckDuckGo[Who is the current President of Microsoft?]\n\n2. Use WebScraper to extract information from the top search results.\n   - :info1: = WebScraper[:info0:]\n\n3. Use BotQA to answer the question based on the scraped information.\n   - :info2: = BotQA[Who is the current President of Microsoft and what major contributions have they made to the company, given :info1:?]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n:info2:"
