        "content": "So the factory currently produces 500 units per day, and they need to increase that by 40% because of higher demand. First, I need to figure out what 40% of 500 is to know how many additional units they need to produce.\n\nLet me calculate 40% of 500:\n\n40% of 500 = 0.4 * 500 = 200 units.\n\nSo, they need to produce an additional 200 units per day.\n\nNow, each worker produces 50 units per day. To find out how many additional workers are needed to produce those extra 200 units, I should divide the additional units required by the production per worker.\n\nAdditional workers needed = additional units needed / units per worker\n\nAdditional workers needed = 200 units / 50 units per worker = 4 workers.\n\nTherefore, the factory needs to hire 4 additional workers to meet the increased demand.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If each worker produces 50 units per day, and they need to produce 200 more units, then 4 workers would indeed produce 200 units (since 4 workers * 50 units/worker = 200 units). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Currently, with the existing number of workers, they produce 500 units. If each worker produces 50 units, then the current number of workers is 500 / 50 = 10 workers.\n\nTo meet the increased demand, they need to produce 500 + 200 = 700 units per day.\n\nSo, the total number of workers needed to produce 700 units is 700 / 50 = 14 workers.\n\nTherefore, the additional workers needed are 14 - 10 = 4 workers.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, the answer is definitely 4 additional workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
