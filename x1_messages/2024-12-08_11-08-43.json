        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of candies: small and large. The small ones cost $0.50 each, and the large ones cost $1.00 each. John buys a total of 20 candies for $15.00, and we need to find out how many large candies he bought.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( s \\) represent the number of small candies.\n\n- Let \\( l \\) represent the number of large candies.\n\nWe know two things:\n\n1. The total number of candies is 20.\n\n2. The total cost is $15.00.\n\nSo, we can set up two equations based on this information.\n\nFirst equation: The total number of candies:\n\n\\[ s + l = 20 \\]\n\nSecond equation: The total cost:\n\n\\[ 0.50s + 1.00l = 15.00 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \\( s \\) and \\( l \\).\n\nOne way to solve this is by substitution. Let's solve the first equation for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = 20 - l \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( s \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 0.50(20 - l) + 1.00l = 15.00 \\]\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 20 - 0.50l + 1.00l = 15.00 \\]\n\n\\[ 10 - 0.50l + 1.00l = 15.00 \\]\n\n\\[ 10 + 0.50l = 15.00 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.50l = 5.00 \\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.50 to find \\( l \\):\n\n\\[ l = \\frac{5.00}{0.50} \\]\n\n\\[ l = 10 \\]\n\nSo, John bought 10 large candies.\n\nTo double-check, let's find the number of small candies and confirm the total cost.\n\nUsing \\( s = 20 - l \\):\n\n\\[ s = 20 - 10 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the total cost:\n\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 10 + 1.00 \\times 10 = 5.00 + 10.00 = 15.00 \\]\n\nIt matches the given total cost. So, the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
