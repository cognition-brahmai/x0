        "content": "So there are 5 apples and 7 oranges in a basket, making a total of 12 fruits. You want to know the probability that if you pick two fruits at random without looking, both of them are oranges.\n\nFirst, let's understand what probability means. Probability is like figuring out the chances of something happening. It's calculated by dividing the number of ways that thing can happen by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the \"thing\" we want is picking two oranges, and the total possible outcomes are all the ways we can pick any two fruits from the basket.\n\nSo, how many ways can we pick two oranges? Well, there are 7 oranges, and we need to choose 2 of them. The number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 7 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for oranges, n = 7 and k = 2.\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7 - 2)!) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5!) = (7 \u00d7 6) / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21.\n\nSo, there are 21 ways to choose 2 oranges from 7.\n\nNow, what's the total number of ways to choose any two fruits from the basket? There are 12 fruits in total, so n = 12 and k = 2.\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10!)) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, there are 66 ways to choose any two fruits from the basket.\n\nNow, the probability that both fruits are oranges is the number of ways to choose two oranges divided by the total number of ways to choose any two fruits.\n\nSo, probability = 21 / 66.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3.\n\n21 \u00f7 3 = 7\n\n66 \u00f7 3 = 22\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 7/22.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both fruits picked are oranges is 7/22.\n\nAlternatively, you can convert this to a decimal or percentage if that's easier to understand.\n\n7 divided by 22 is approximately 0.3182.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.3182 \u00d7 100 \u2248 31.82%.\n\nSo, there's roughly a 31.82% chance that both fruits picked are oranges.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the chances step by step.\n\nFirst, what's the probability that the first fruit picked is an orange?\n\nThere are 7 oranges out of 12 fruits, so the probability is 7/12.\n\nThen, given that the first fruit was an orange, there are now 6 oranges left and a total of 11 fruits left in the basket.\n\nSo, the probability that the second fruit is also an orange is 6/11.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening (both fruits being oranges), you multiply the probabilities:\n\n(7/12) \u00d7 (6/11) = (7 \u00d7 6) / (12 \u00d7 11) = 42 / 132.\n\nSimplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n42 \u00f7 6 = 7\n\n132 \u00f7 6 = 22\n\nAgain, you get 7/22, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the probability is 7/22 or approximately 31.82%.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
