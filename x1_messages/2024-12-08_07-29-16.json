        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There are two factories, right? The first one produces 200 units of a product in 4 hours. The second one takes 8 hours to produce the same number of units, which is also 200 units. The question is, which factory has a higher production rate?\n\nOkay, so production rate, I think, is about how many units a factory can produce in a certain amount of time. Like, how efficient it is. So, if one factory can make more units in less time, it's probably more efficient or has a higher production rate.\n\nSo, for the first factory, it produces 200 units in 4 hours. To find the production rate, maybe I should calculate how many units it produces per hour. That sounds reasonable.\n\nSo, units per hour for factory one would be 200 units divided by 4 hours. Let me do that calculation. 200 divided by 4 is 50. So, factory one produces 50 units per hour.\n\nNow, for factory two, it produces the same 200 units but takes 8 hours to do so. So, its production rate would be 200 units divided by 8 hours. Let's calculate that. 200 divided by 8 is 25. So, factory two produces 25 units per hour.\n\nComparing the two, factory one produces 50 units per hour, and factory two produces 25 units per hour. So, clearly, factory one has a higher production rate.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider something else. Maybe the quality of the products or something like that, but the question only asks about the production rate, which is just about the number of units produced per unit of time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at it in terms of time per unit, like how much time each factory takes to produce one unit. For factory one, it's 4 hours for 200 units, so time per unit would be 4 hours divided by 200 units, which is 0.02 hours per unit. For factory two, it's 8 hours for 200 units, so 8 divided by 200 is 0.04 hours per unit. So again, factory one is faster, taking less time per unit.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see how many units each factory produces in the same amount of time. For example, in 8 hours, factory one could produce twice as much because it takes only 4 hours to produce 200 units. So in 8 hours, factory one would produce 400 units, while factory two produces only 200 units. So again, factory one has a higher production rate.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough. Factory one has a higher production rate because it produces more units in less time compared to factory two.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Factory one has a higher production rate.}} \\]"
