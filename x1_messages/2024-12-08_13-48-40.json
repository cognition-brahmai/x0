The play is set in this historic city during the late 16th century, a time when the Montague and Capulet families were engaged in a bitter feud that would ultimately lead to the deaths of their children, Romeo and Juliet. Verona is known for its rich history, lovely architecture, and, of course, its association with this famous play."
