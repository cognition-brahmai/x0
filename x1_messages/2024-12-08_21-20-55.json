        "content": "So there are 100 people at this party, and we're trying to figure out the minimum percentage of people who like both chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Let's see.\n\nFirst, 60% of them like chocolate ice cream. So, that's 60% of 100 people, which is 60 people. Similarly, 75% like vanilla ice cream, which is 75 people.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of people who like both. To minimize the overlap, we'd want as many people as possible to like only one flavor.\n\nSo, if we have 60 people who like chocolate and 75 who like vanilla, the total number of people who like at least one of the flavors would be the sum of those who like chocolate and those who like vanilla, minus those who like both.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- C = number of people who like chocolate = 60\n\n- V = number of people who like vanilla = 75\n\n- Both = number of people who like both\n\nThen, the total number of people who like at least one flavor is C + V - Both.\n\nBut we know there are only 100 people in total. So, C + V - Both \u2264 100.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 60 + 75 - Both \u2264 100 \u21d2 135 - Both \u2264 100 \u21d2 Both \u2265 35.\n\nSo, the minimum number of people who like both is 35.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about it differently. If we have 100 people, and 60 like chocolate, that means 40 do not like chocolate. Similarly, 75 like vanilla, so 25 do not like vanilla.\n\nIf we want to minimize the number of people who like both, we'd want as many people as possible to be in the groups that like only one flavor.\n\nSo, the number of people who like only chocolate would be C - Both, and those who like only vanilla would be V - Both.\n\nThe sum of those who like only chocolate, only vanilla, and both should be less than or equal to 100.\n\nSo, (C - Both) + (V - Both) + Both \u2264 100 \u21d2 C + V - Both \u2264 100 \u21d2 Both \u2265 C + V - 100.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: Both \u2265 60 + 75 - 100 = 35.\n\nSo again, we get that the minimum percentage of people who like both is 35%.\n\nWait a minute, the question asked for the percentage, not the number of people. Since there are 100 people, 35 people correspond to 35% of the total.\n\nSo, the minimum percentage of people who like both chocolate and vanilla ice cream is 35%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35\\%} \\]"
