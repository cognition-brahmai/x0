        "content": "Let's see. So, there's this problem about friends going out for dinner and splitting the bill. Some forgot their wallets, and the others had to pay extra to cover their share. I need to find out how many friends were in the group originally.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand the situation. There's a total bill of $108. Originally, they planned to split this bill evenly among all the friends. But three of them forgot their wallets, so they couldn't pay. That means the remaining friends had to cover the cost for these three by paying an extra $6 each.\n\nLet me denote the original number of friends as \\( n \\). So, if there are \\( n \\) friends, the original share per person would be \\( \\frac{108}{n} \\).\n\nNow, three friends forgot their wallets, so the number of friends who actually paid is \\( n - 3 \\). These \\( n - 3 \\) friends paid an extra $6 each to cover the shares of the three who didn't pay.\n\nSo, the amount each of the \\( n - 3 \\) friends paid is their original share plus an extra $6, which is \\( \\frac{108}{n} + 6 \\).\n\nMeanwhile, the total amount paid by these \\( n - 3 \\) friends should equal the total bill of $108.\n\nTherefore, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ (n - 3) \\left( \\frac{108}{n} + 6 \\right) = 108 \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's distribute the terms:\n\n\\[ (n - 3) \\cdot \\frac{108}{n} + (n - 3) \\cdot 6 = 108 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{108(n - 3)}{n} + 6(n - 3) = 108 \\]\n\nI can factor out \\( (n - 3) \\):\n\n\\[ (n - 3) \\left( \\frac{108}{n} + 6 \\right) = 108 \\]\n\nWait, that's where I started. Maybe I should expand it differently.\n\nLet me try to combine the terms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{108(n - 3)}{n} + 6(n - 3) = 108 \\]\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator would be \\( n \\).\n\nSo, I can rewrite \\( 6(n - 3) \\) as \\( \\frac{6n(n - 3)}{n} \\), but that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can multiply both sides of the equation by \\( n \\) to eliminate the denominator.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ n \\cdot \\frac{108(n - 3)}{n} + n \\cdot 6(n - 3) = 108n \\]\n\n\\[ 108(n - 3) + 6n(n - 3) = 108n \\]\n\nNow, expand the terms:\n\n\\[ 108n - 324 + 6n^2 - 18n = 108n \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 6n^2 + (108n - 18n) - 324 = 108n \\]\n\n\\[ 6n^2 + 90n - 324 = 108n \\]\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[ 6n^2 + 90n - 324 - 108n = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 6n^2 - 18n - 324 = 0 \\]\n\nI can simplify this by dividing all terms by 6:\n\n\\[ n^2 - 3n - 54 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: \\( n^2 - 3n - 54 = 0 \\)\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula: \\( n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -3 \\), and \\( c = -54 \\).\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ d = b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4(1)(-54) = 9 + 216 = 225 \\]\n\nSince \\( d = 225 \\), which is a perfect square (\\( 15^2 = 225 \\)), there are two real solutions.\n\nNow, apply the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{225}}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm 15}{2} \\]\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\( n = \\frac{3 + 15}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\)\n\n2. \\( n = \\frac{3 - 15}{2} = \\frac{-12}{2} = -6 \\)\n\nSince the number of friends can't be negative, \\( n = -6 \\) is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the original number of friends is \\( n = 9 \\).\n\nLet me verify this answer to make sure it makes sense.\n\nIf there are 9 friends originally, the original share per person would be \\( \\frac{108}{9} = 12 \\) dollars.\n\nThree friends forgot their wallets, so only \\( 9 - 3 = 6 \\) friends paid.\n\nEach of these 6 friends paid an extra $6, so their new share is \\( 12 + 6 = 18 \\) dollars.\n\nTotal amount paid by the 6 friends: \\( 6 \\times 18 = 108 \\) dollars, which matches the total bill.\n\nTherefore, the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
