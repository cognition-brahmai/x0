        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1200 widgets every 8 hours, and it operates 24 hours a day. We need to find out how many widgets it produces in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many 8-hour shifts there are in a 24-hour day. Since 24 divided by 8 is 3, there are 3 shifts per day.\n\nSo, if the factory produces 1200 widgets per shift, and there are 3 shifts in a day, then daily production would be 1200 multiplied by 3, which is 3600 widgets per day.\n\nNow, to find out the weekly production, I need to know how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nTherefore, the weekly production would be the daily production multiplied by 7, which is 3600 times 7.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3600 times 7 equals 25,200 widgets per week.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again: 1200 widgets every 8 hours.\n\n24 hours in a day divided by 8 hours per shift equals 3 shifts per day.\n\n1200 widgets per shift times 3 shifts equals 3600 widgets per day.\n\n3600 widgets per day times 7 days equals 25,200 widgets per week.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the hourly production rate and then find the weekly production.\n\nLet's try that to confirm.\n\nIf 1200 widgets are produced in 8 hours, then the hourly production rate is 1200 divided by 8, which is 150 widgets per hour.\n\nNow, if the factory operates 24 hours a day, then daily production would be 150 widgets per hour times 24 hours, which is 3600 widgets per day.\n\nAnd then, 3600 widgets per day times 7 days equals 25,200 widgets per week.\n\nSame answer as before, so that seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total number of hours in a week that the factory operates and then use the hourly production rate to find the total weekly production.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, so total hours in a week are 24 times 7, which is 168 hours.\n\nAt 150 widgets per hour, the total weekly production would be 150 times 168.\n\nLet me calculate that: 150 times 168.\n\nFirst, 150 times 100 is 15,000.\n\n150 times 60 is 9,000.\n\n150 times 8 is 1,200.\n\nAdding those up: 15,000 plus 9,000 is 24,000, plus 1,200 is 25,200.\n\nAgain, the same result: 25,200 widgets per week.\n\nSo, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the production, like downtime for maintenance or breaks, but the problem doesn't mention any such constraints. It says the factory operates 24 hours a day, so I assume it's running continuously without breaks.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 25,200 widgets in a week.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25200} \\]"
