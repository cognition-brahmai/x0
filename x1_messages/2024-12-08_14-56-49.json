        "content": "So the baker has a recipe that uses 3 eggs for every 2 cups of flour. Now, he's planning to use 20 cups of flour, and I need to figure out how many eggs that would require. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I should probably set up a proportion because the relationship between eggs and flour is consistent. So, if 3 eggs correspond to 2 cups of flour, then x eggs will correspond to 20 cups of flour. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the proportion would be:\n\n3 eggs / 2 cups of flour = x eggs / 20 cups of flour\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To do that, I can cross-multiply.\n\n3 * 20 = 2 * x\n\nThat gives me:\n\n60 = 2x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 60 / 2\n\nx = 30\n\nSo, the baker needs 30 eggs if he uses 20 cups of flour.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a lot of eggs. Maybe I should double-check my calculation.\n\nLet me think differently. If 2 cups of flour require 3 eggs, then 1 cup of flour would require 3/2 eggs, which is 1.5 eggs.\n\nSo, for 20 cups of flour, it would be 20 * 1.5 eggs.\n\n20 * 1.5 = 30 eggs.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, it is 30 eggs.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of multiples. If 2 cups of flour use 3 eggs, then for 20 cups, which is 10 times more (since 20 / 2 = 10), he would need 10 times more eggs.\n\n10 * 3 = 30 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think 30 eggs is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
