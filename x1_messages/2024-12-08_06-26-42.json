        "content": "So I've got this problem here: if it takes 10 workers 5 days to build a wall, how long would it take 50 workers to build the same wall? Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time it takes to build the wall. I think this is a case of inverse proportion, meaning that if you have more workers, it should take less time to build the wall, assuming they all work at the same rate.\n\nSo, with 10 workers, it takes 5 days. If I have 50 workers, that's 5 times as many workers. Therefore, it should take 1/5 of the time, right? Let me calculate that.\n\n5 days divided by 5 is 1 day. So, it should take 1 day for 50 workers to build the same wall.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of worker-days. A worker-day is the amount of work one worker can do in one day. So, the total amount of work required to build the wall is the number of workers multiplied by the number of days they work.\n\nIn this case, 10 workers times 5 days equals 50 worker-days. So, the wall requires 50 worker-days to be built.\n\nNow, if I have 50 workers, how many days will it take for them to complete 50 worker-days of work? Well, if all 50 workers are working together, each contributing one worker-day per day, then they would complete 50 worker-days in 1 day.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it would take 1 day for 50 workers to build the wall.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Is there any factor that could affect this outcome, like space constraints on the construction site or limited resources?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any constraints beyond the number of workers, so I'll assume that all 50 workers can work simultaneously without getting in each other's way or running out of materials.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to find out how much work one worker can do in one day. If 10 workers take 5 days to build the wall, then one worker would take 10 times as long to build the wall alone.\n\nSo, one worker would take 10 workers * 5 days = 50 days to build the wall by themselves.\n\nNow, if you have 50 workers working together, each doing 1/50th of the wall per day, then together they can build the entire wall in 1 day.\n\nThat makes sense. It's consistent with the previous method.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If 10 workers take 5 days, then increasing the number of workers by a factor of x should decrease the time by the same factor x, assuming the work can be divided evenly among them.\n\nIn this case, increasing from 10 to 50 workers is a factor of 5. Therefore, the time should decrease by a factor of 5: 5 days / 5 = 1 day.\n\nEverything points to the same answer: 1 day.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result. There doesn't seem to be any trick or additional consideration in the problem as it's stated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
