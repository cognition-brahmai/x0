Adele is known for her powerful vocals and emotionally charged songs that often deal with themes of love, heartbreak, and resilience. Her ballads are characterized by their sincerity, vulnerability, and the way they resonate with listeners on a personal level.\n\nTo compose a ballad about unrequited love in Adele's style, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand Adele's Style:** Listen to Adele's ballads to get a sense of her vocal delivery, the emotional depth she conveys, and the musical arrangements she uses. Pay attention to her use of dynamics, phrasing, and the way she builds emotion throughout a song.\n\n2. **Craft a Compelling Story:** Unrequited love is a universal theme, but to make it resonate, you need to create a specific story or scenario. Think about the emotions involved\u2014longing, heartache, hope, and perhaps acceptance. Consider the perspective of the person who is in love but not reciprocated.\n\n3. **Develop a Strong Chorus:** In Adele's songs, the chorus often contains the most memorable and emotionally impactful lines. Make sure your chorus captures the essence of the song and is catchy enough to stick in the listener's mind.\n\n4. **Use Heartfelt Lyrics:** Adele's lyrics are known for their honesty and raw emotion. Write from the heart, using vivid imagery and relatable experiences. Don't be afraid to delve into the complexities of unrequited love, including the pain, the dreams, and the eventual coming to terms with the situation.\n\n5. **Incorporate Musical Elements:** While you may not be composing the music, thinking about the musical elements can help shape your lyrics. Adele's ballads often feature piano or orchestral arrangements that complement the emotional content of the song. Consider how the music could enhance the lyrics you're writing.\n\n6. **Edit and Refine:** Like any piece of writing, your ballad will benefit from editing and refinement. Read through your lyrics multiple times, seeking to improve phrasing, rhyme schemes, and overall flow. Ensure that the emotions are consistent and that the story progresses logically.\n\nHere's a brief example to get you started:\n\n**Verse 1:**  \nI saw you across the room,  \nYour smile was like the sun,  \nI knew from that moment,  \nMy heart was already won.  \n\nBut you didn't see me,  \nIn the way that I saw you,  \nMy feelings were just a secret,  \nA love that was never true.  \n\n**Chorus:**  \nOh, unrequited love,  \nA fire that burns so bright,  \nBut in the end, it consumes me,  \nLeaving me in the cold night.  \n\n**Verse 2:**  \nI tried to tell you,  \nHow I felt deep inside,  \nBut my words got lost in the air,  \nAnd you just walked on by.  \n\nNow I'm left with memories,  \nOf what could have been,  \nBut I hold on to the hope,  \nThat someday you'll see me.  \n\n**Chorus:**  \nOh, unrequited love,  \nA dream that I can't let go,  \nBut I'll keep on holding on,  \nUntil my heart learns to know.  \n\n**Bridge:**  \nMaybe one day,  \nYou'll look back and see,  \nThe love that I had for you,  \nWas real and meant to be.  \n\n**Chorus:**  \nOh, unrequited love,  \nA song that I'll always sing,  \nThrough the pain and the tears,  \nI'll find the strength to move on and begin again.  \n\n**Outro:**  \nSo here's to unrequited love,  \nTo the hearts that never mend,  \nMay we all find our way,  \nTo a love that's never pretend.  \n\nRemember, this is just a starting point. Feel free to expand upon it, change it, or create something entirely new that captures the essence of Adele's style and the depth of unrequited love.)"
