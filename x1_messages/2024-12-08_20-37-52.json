        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a culture of bacteria, and every second, 1% of them dies. We need to find out how much of the original amount is left after one minute.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. If 1% dies every second, that means 99% of the bacteria survive each second. So, survival rate per second is 99%.\n\nNow, one minute has 60 seconds. So, this process repeats 60 times.\n\nI think I can model this as a exponential decay problem. The formula for exponential decay is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Amount} = \\text{Initial Amount} \\times (1 - \\text{decay rate})^{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the decay rate is 1% per second, so \\(1 - \\text{decay rate} = 0.99\\), and time is 60 seconds.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Amount} = \\text{Initial Amount} \\times (0.99)^{60} \\]\n\nI need to calculate \\(0.99^{60}\\) to find out what percentage of the original amount remains.\n\nLet me grab a calculator for this.\n\nFirst, calculate 0.99 to the power of 60.\n\n\\[ 0.99^{60} \\approx 0.5469 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.5469 of the original amount remains.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, I'll multiply by 100.\n\n\\[ 0.5469 \\times 100 = 54.69\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, about 54.69% of the original bacteria remain after one minute.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let's see.\n\nIf 1% dies every second, that's a steady rate. But because it's compounding over time, the overall survival rate is less than what I might intuitively think.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as a continuous decay process, but since it's discrete (every second), the exponential model is appropriate.\n\nLet me consider another approach to confirm.\n\nSuppose I start with 100 bacteria for simplicity.\n\nEvery second, 1% dies, so 1 bacterium dies each second.\n\nBut wait, 1% of the current amount, not the original.\n\nSo, in the first second, 1% of 100 is 1, so 99 remain.\n\nIn the second second, 1% of 99 is 0.99, so approximately 98.01 remain.\n\nContinuing this way for 60 seconds would be tedious, but it's the same as calculating \\(100 \\times (0.99)^{60}\\), which is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, again, about 54.69 bacteria remain, which is 54.69%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for exponential decay in continuous time, but since it's discrete, the previous method is more accurate.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for compound interest, which is similar:\n\n\\[ A = P(1 - r)^t \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(A\\) is the amount after time \\(t\\)\n\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount (initial amount)\n\n- \\(r\\) is the decay rate per time period\n\n- \\(t\\) is the number of time periods\n\nThis is exactly what I used earlier.\n\nSo, I think 54.69% is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs it possible that the 1% die overall, meaning that after each second, the remaining bacteria are reduced by 1% of the original amount, not the current amount?\n\nFor example, if 1% of the original amount dies each second, then it's a different scenario.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Every second, 1% of the bacteria in a culture dies.\"\n\nI think this means 1% of the current amount dies each second.\n\nIf it were 1% of the original amount dying each second, that would be a different interpretation.\n\nGiven the wording, I believe my first approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if it were 1% of the original amount dying each second, then the amount dying each second would be constant, and the decay would be linear, not exponential.\n\nBut in this case, it's a proportional decay, leading to exponential decay.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 54.69% is the right answer.\n\nLet me round it to two decimal places for clarity.\n\nTherefore, approximately 54.69% of the original bacteria remain after one minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54.69\\%} \\]"
