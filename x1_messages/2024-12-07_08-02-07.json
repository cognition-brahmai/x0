        "content": "So I've got this problem about a hospital planning its nursing staff for the next year. They currently have 1,000 nurses, but they're expecting a 15% annual turnover rate because of retirements and people changing jobs. Also, they think patient volume will increase by 10%, which means they'll need more nurses to handle the extra patients. I need to figure out how many new nurses they need to hire, considering both the turnover and the increased patient volume.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what turnover rate means. A 15% turnover rate means that 15% of the current nurses will leave the hospital each year. So, out of 1,000 nurses, 15% of them will retire or change jobs. To find out how many that is, I can calculate 15% of 1,000.\n\n15% of 1,000 is (15/100) * 1,000 = 150 nurses.\n\nSo, the hospital will lose 150 nurses due to turnover.\n\nNow, they also expect a 10% increase in patient volume, which will require more nursing staff. To find out how many additional nurses are needed for this increase, I need to calculate 10% of the current number of nurses, assuming that the patient-nurse ratio should remain the same.\n\n10% of 1,000 is (10/100) * 1,000 = 100 nurses.\n\nSo, they need an additional 100 nurses to handle the increased patient volume.\n\nNow, to find out the total number of new nurses they need to hire, I should add the number of nurses lost to turnover and the number needed for the increased patient volume.\n\nThat would be 150 (for turnover) + 100 (for increased patient volume) = 250 nurses.\n\nWait a minute, is that the whole picture? Let me think again. The hospital is losing 150 nurses to turnover, and needs an additional 100 nurses for more patients. So, they need to hire at least 150 to replace the ones who are leaving, and another 100 to handle the increased workload. That does seem to total 250 new hires.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the additional 100 nurses needed for patient volume could include some of the replacements for the turnover. But no, that doesn't make sense because the turnover is a separate issue from the increased patient volume. The turnover is about replacing nurses who are leaving, while the increased patient volume is about handling more patients than before.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think about the total number of nurses needed after accounting for both turnover and increased patient volume.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of nurses needed to replace those who are leaving due to turnover. That's 150 nurses.\n\nThen, calculate the total number of nurses needed to handle the increased patient volume. Since patient volume is increasing by 10%, and assuming that the current nurse-patient ratio is adequate, they need to increase their nursing staff by 10% to maintain that ratio.\n\nSo, they need to hire 100 additional nurses for the increased patient volume.\n\nTherefore, the total number of new hires would be 150 (for turnover) + 100 (for patient volume) = 250 nurses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the total nursing staff required at the end of the year.\n\nStarting with 1,000 nurses, after a 15% turnover, the number of remaining nurses would be:\n\n1,000 - (15% of 1,000) = 1,000 - 150 = 850 nurses.\n\nNow, to handle the 10% increase in patient volume, they need to increase their nursing staff by 10%, which is 10% of the original 1,000, so 100 nurses.\n\nTherefore, the total number of nurses needed at the end of the year is:\n\n850 (remaining after turnover) + 100 (for increased patient volume) = 950 nurses.\n\nBut wait, that seems lower than the original number of 1,000 nurses. That can't be right. If patient volume is increasing, they should need more nurses, not fewer.\n\nOh, I see. I think I messed up the calculation. Let's try that again.\n\nIf they start with 1,000 nurses and have a 15% turnover, they lose 150 nurses, leaving them with 850 nurses.\n\nBut they need to increase their nursing staff by 10% to handle the increased patient volume. A 10% increase on the original 1,000 nurses would be 1,100 nurses.\n\nSo, they need to go from 850 nurses (after turnover) to 1,100 nurses (to handle the increased patient volume).\n\nTherefore, the number of new nurses they need to hire is:\n\n1,100 (required) - 850 (remaining after turnover) = 250 nurses.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total required nursing staff based on the increased patient volume and then account for turnover.\n\nIf patient volume is increasing by 10%, they need to have 10% more nurses than they currently have, assuming the nurse-patient ratio remains constant.\n\nSo, they need 1,000 + (10% of 1,000) = 1,100 nurses.\n\nBut, considering a 15% turnover rate, they need to hire enough nurses to replace those who leave and still reach the 1,100 target.\n\nIf they have 1,000 nurses now and expect to lose 15%, or 150 nurses, they'll have 850 nurses left.\n\nTo reach 1,100 nurses, they need to hire 1,100 - 850 = 250 nurses.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe considering that some of the new hires could be counted towards both replacing turnover and handling increased patient volume.\n\nBut, no, that doesn't make sense because the turnover is about replacing nurses who are leaving, and the increased patient volume is about adding more nurses to handle more patients.\n\nThese are two separate needs: one is replacement, and the other is growth to handle more patients.\n\nTherefore, the hospital needs to hire 250 new nurses to account for both turnover and the increased patient volume.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
