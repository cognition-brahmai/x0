        "content": "So the factory makes 1200 units of product A and 800 units of product B in one day. I need to find out what percentage of the total production is product A. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should find the total production for the day. That would be the sum of product A and product B, right? So, 1200 plus 800. Let's add those up.\n\n1200 + 800 = 2000 units in total.\n\nNow, I need to find out what percentage of these 2000 units is product A. Product A is 1200 units, so I think I need to divide 1200 by 2000 and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, percentage of product A = (1200 / 2000) * 100.\n\nLet me do the division first. 1200 divided by 2000.\n\n1200 \u00f7 2000 = 0.6.\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.6 * 100 = 60%.\n\nSo, product A makes up 60% of the total production.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nIf total production is 2000 units, and product A is 1200, which is indeed 60% of 2000.\n\nJust to be sure, let's calculate product B's percentage as well.\n\nProduct B is 800 units.\n\nPercentage of product B = (800 / 2000) * 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40%.\n\nSo, product A is 60%, product B is 40%, which adds up to 100%. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in ratios. Product A to total production is 1200:2000, which simplifies to 12:20, and further to 3:5. To get percentage, 3/5 * 100 = 60%. Same answer.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60\\%} \\]"
