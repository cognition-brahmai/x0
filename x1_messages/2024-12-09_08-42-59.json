        "content": "Let's see. There are 7 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total.\n\nFirst, I think about one person. If there's one person, they won't shake hands with anyone because there's no one else. So, 0 handshakes.\n\nIf there are 2 people, they shake hands with each other once. So, 1 handshake.\n\nWith 3 people, each shakes hands with the other two, but since each handshake involves two people, I have to be careful not to double count. So, for 3 people, it's 3 handshakes in total.\n\nWait, is there a pattern here? Let me list them out.\n\nFor 2 people: A and B. A shakes with B. That's 1 handshake.\n\nFor 3 people: A, B, C. A shakes with B and C; B shakes with C. So, that's 3 handshakes.\n\nFor 4 people: A, B, C, D. A shakes with B, C, D; B shakes with C, D; C shakes with D. That's 6 handshakes.\n\nHmm, 2 people: 1; 3 people: 3; 4 people: 6. It seems like it's increasing by adding the next number each time. 1, then 1+2=3, then 3+3=6.\n\nWait, 6 is also 4 choose 2, which is the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 4 to shake hands. Yeah, that makes sense because a handshake involves 2 people.\n\nSo, for n people, the number of handshakes is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, for 7 people, it should be 7 choose 2, which is 7*6/2 = 21.\n\nLet me double-check. If I list them out:\n\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nA shakes with B, C, D, E, F, G: that's 6.\n\nB shakes with C, D, E, F, G: that's 5, but A already shook with B, so we don't count it again.\n\nC shakes with D, E, F, G: 4.\n\nD shakes with E, F, G: 3.\n\nE shakes with F, G: 2.\n\nF shakes with G: 1.\n\nSo, 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21.\n\nYes, that matches the formula.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula n(n-1)/2 for n=7: 7*6/2 = 42/2 = 21.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is 21.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
