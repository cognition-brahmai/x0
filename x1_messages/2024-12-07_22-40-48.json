It was a Galaxy-class starship, which was one of the largest and most advanced classes of starships in the Star Trek universe at that time. The Enterprise-D, as it was often referred to, served as a mobile space station, research facility, and diplomatic vessel, embarking on missions to explore new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before."
