        "content": "Alright, I'm going to help you design a simple command-line calculator in Java that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. We'll make sure it's user-friendly and handles basic operations correctly.\n\nFirst, let's think about the steps we need to follow:\n\n1. **Input**: We need to get two numbers and the operation the user wants to perform.\n2. **Operation**: Based on the operation, we'll perform the corresponding calculation.\n3. **Output**: Display the result to the user.\n\nWe also need to consider edge cases, like division by zero, and make sure our program handles them gracefully.\n\n### Step 1: Setting Up the Project\n\nSince this is a simple command-line application, we don't need any fancy setup. Just create a new Java class, say `SimpleCalculator`, and write our code inside the `main` method.\n\n### Step 2: Getting User Input\n\nWe'll use the `Scanner` class to read input from the user. We need to get two numbers and the operation.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter first number:\");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter second number:\");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter operation (+, -, *, /):\");\n        String operator = scanner.next();\n\n        scanner.close();\n\n        // Perform calculation based on operator\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Performing the Calculation\n\nWe'll use a switch statement to handle different operations.\n\n```java\ndouble result;\nswitch (operator) {\n    case \"+\":\n        result = num1 + num2;\n        break;\n    case \"-\":\n        result = num1 - num2;\n        break;\n    case \"*\":\n        result = num1 * num2;\n        break;\n    case \"/\":\n        if (num2 != 0) {\n            result = num1 / num2;\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n            return;\n        }\n        break;\n    default:\n        System.out.println(\"Invalid operator\");\n        return;\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n```\n\n### Step 4: Putting It All Together\n\nNow, let's combine all the parts into a single class.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter first number:\");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter second number:\");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter operation (+, -, *, /):\");\n        String operator = scanner.next();\n\n        scanner.close();\n\n        double result;\n        switch (operator) {\n            case \"+\":\n                result = num1 + num2;\n                break;\n            case \"-\":\n                result = num1 - num2;\n                break;\n            case \"*\":\n                result = num1 * num2;\n                break;\n            case \"/\":\n                if (num2 != 0) {\n                    result = num1 / num2;\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n                    return;\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid operator\");\n                return;\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Testing the Calculator\n\nLet's test the calculator with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.\n\n1. **Addition**: 5 + 3 should give 8.\n2. **Subtraction**: 10 - 4 should give 6.\n3. **Multiplication**: 7 * 6 should give 42.\n4. **Division**: 8 / 2 should give 4.\n5. **Division by zero**: Any number / 0 should give an error message.\n6. **Invalid operator**: Using an operator like '%' should give an invalid operator message.\n\n### Step 6: Possible Enhancements\n\n- **Handling non-numeric inputs**: Currently, the program assumes users enter valid numbers. We can add checks to handle invalid inputs.\n- **More operations**: Extend the calculator to support more operations like exponentiation or modulo.\n- **Looping**: Allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.\n\nFor now, this simple calculator should meet the basic requirements. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n\n### Final Solution\n\nTo create a simple command-line calculator in Java that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers entered by the user, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up the Project:**\n   - Create a new Java class named `SimpleCalculator`.\n\n2. **Get User Input:**\n   - Use the `Scanner` class to read two numbers and the operation from the user.\n\n3. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - Use a `switch` statement to perform the desired operation.\n   - Handle division by zero and invalid operators gracefully.\n\n4. **Display the Result:**\n   - Output the result of the calculation.\n\n#### Solution Code\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SimpleCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter first number:\");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter second number:\");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter operation (+, -, *, /):\");\n        String operator = scanner.next();\n\n        scanner.close();\n\n        double result;\n        switch (operator) {\n            case \"+\":\n                result = num1 + num2;\n                break;\n            case \"-\":\n                result = num1 - num2;\n                break;\n            case \"*\":\n                result = num1 * num2;\n                break;\n            case \"/\":\n                if (num2 != 0) {\n                    result = num1 / num2;\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero.\");\n                    return;\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid operator\");\n                return;\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The program uses `Scanner` to read two double values and a string representing the operation.\n\n2. **Operation Processing:**\n   - A `switch` statement evaluates the operation and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n   - Division by zero is checked and handled to prevent runtime errors.\n   - Invalid operators are caught and an error message is displayed.\n\n3. **Output:**\n   - The result of the operation is printed to the console.\n\nThis simple calculator effectively handles basic arithmetic operations and provides error handling for invalid inputs and operations."
