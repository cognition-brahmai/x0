        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a farmer has 100 meters of fencing material and wants to enclose a rectangular field. I need to figure out what the maximum area he can enclose with that amount of fencing is. Alright, let's start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width, right? So, area A equals length L times width W, or A = L * W.\n\nNow, the perimeter of a rectangle is the total distance around it, which is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Since the farmer has 100 meters of fencing, the perimeter P is 100 meters. So, P = 2L + 2W = 100.\n\nI need to maximize the area A, given that the perimeter is fixed at 100 meters. To do this, I think I should express one variable in terms of the other using the perimeter equation, and then substitute into the area equation. That way, I can have area as a function of one variable and find its maximum.\n\nLet me solve the perimeter equation for one of the variables, say W.\n\n2L + 2W = 100\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nL + W = 50\n\nThen, W = 50 - L.\n\nNow, plug this into the area equation:\n\nA = L * W = L * (50 - L) = 50L - L\u00b2.\n\nSo, A(L) = 50L - L\u00b2.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of L, and it's in the form A = -L\u00b2 + 50L. Quadratic equations graph as parabolas, and since the coefficient of L\u00b2 is negative, this parabola opens downwards, which means it has a maximum point at its vertex.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola given by f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c occurs at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -1 and b = 50, so the vertex is at L = -50/(2*(-1)) = 50/2 = 25.\n\nSo, the length that maximizes the area is 25 meters. Then, using W = 50 - L, W = 50 - 25 = 25 meters.\n\nWait a minute, that means the rectangle is actually a square with sides of 25 meters each. Is that possible? And does that make sense?\n\nLet me check the area: A = 25 * 25 = 625 square meters.\n\nBut is that the maximum possible area? Let me try some other values to see.\n\nSuppose L = 30 meters, then W = 50 - 30 = 20 meters, and A = 30 * 20 = 600 square meters, which is less than 625.\n\nOr, if L = 20 meters, then W = 30 meters, A = 20 * 30 = 600 again.\n\nOr, L = 10 meters, W = 40 meters, A = 400 square meters.\n\nSeems like 25 by 25 gives the highest area.\n\nBut is there a mathematical way to confirm that without just plugging in numbers?\n\nWell, since A(L) = -L\u00b2 + 50L is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, it indeed has a maximum at its vertex, which we've already calculated as L = 25.\n\nAlternatively, we could take the derivative of A with respect to L and set it to zero to find the maximum.\n\nSo, A(L) = -L\u00b2 + 50L.\n\nThe derivative A'(L) = -2L + 50.\n\nSet A'(L) = 0:\n\n-2L + 50 = 0 => 2L = 50 => L = 25.\n\nThat confirms our earlier result.\n\nAlso, to ensure it's a maximum, we can check the second derivative A''(L) = -2, which is negative, indicating a maximum.\n\nSo, mathematically, the maximum area is achieved when L = 25 meters, leading to W = 25 meters, and A = 625 square meters.\n\nBut wait, is there any constraint I'm missing? For example, does the field have to be rectangular, or could it be another shape that might enclose a larger area with the same perimeter?\n\nWell, the problem specifies a rectangular field, so I should stick to that. But out of curiosity, I know that among all shapes with a given perimeter, a circle encloses the maximum area. That's known as the isoperimeter inequality.\n\nFor a circle, the perimeter (circumference) is C = 2\u03c0r, and the area is A = \u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nGiven C = 100 meters, r = C/(2\u03c0) = 100/(2\u03c0) = 50/\u03c0 meters.\n\nThen, A = \u03c0*(50/\u03c0)\u00b2 = \u03c0*(2500/\u03c0\u00b2) = 2500/\u03c0 \u2248 796.18 square meters.\n\nThat's larger than the 625 square meters from the square. But since the problem specifies a rectangle, we have to stick with that shape.\n\nAlso, in practice, farms often use rectangular fields because they are easier to work with machinery and fit into plots of land.\n\nSo, returning to the rectangular case, is there any other way to approach this problem?\n\nMaybe using inequalities. For example, the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality (AM-GM inequality) states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean.\n\nIn this case, for L and W, we have (L + W)/2 \u2265 \u221a(LW).\n\nWe know L + W = 50, so (50)/2 = 25 \u2265 \u221a(LW).\n\nTherefore, 25 \u2265 \u221aA, assuming A = LW.\n\nSquaring both sides: 625 \u2265 A.\n\nSo, the maximum possible area is 625 square meters, achieved when L = W = 25 meters, which again confirms our previous result.\n\nAlright, so all these methods lead me to the same conclusion: the maximum area is 625 square meters when the rectangle is a square with sides of 25 meters.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any restriction on the dimensions of the field, like minimum or maximum length or width? The problem doesn't mention any, so we can assume that the only constraint is the perimeter being 100 meters.\n\nAlso, is the fencing material continuous, or are there posts or other elements that might affect the total length? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume the fencing is continuous.\n\nAdditionally, is the field to be enclosed on all sides, or is one side already bounded by something else, like a river or a wall? The problem says to enclose a rectangular field with fencing, so I think all four sides need fencing.\n\nIf only three sides needed fencing because one side is bounded naturally, that would change the problem, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, with all that considered, I'm confident that the maximum area is 625 square meters.\n\nLet me write down the final answer.\n\nThe maximum area that can be enclosed is 625 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{625} \\]"
