        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a hotel chain planning to build a new resort. It's going to have 300 rooms, multiple restaurants, and recreational facilities, and the total cost is estimated at $60 million. The expenses are broken down into four main categories: room construction, restaurant and kitchen facilities, recreational amenities, and landscaping and other miscellaneous costs. The percentages are 40% for rooms, 30% for restaurants and kitchens, 20% for recreational amenities, and 10% for landscaping and miscellaneous costs. I need to calculate the individual budgets for each of these components.\n\nAlright, first things first, the total cost is $60 million. That's the whole pie, and I need to slice it into these four parts based on the given percentages.\n\nStarting with room construction, which is the biggest chunk at 40%. So, to find out how much money is allocated for room construction, I need to calculate 40% of $60 million.\n\nI know that percentage means per hundred, so 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4. So, I can multiply $60 million by 0.4 to get the room construction budget.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nRoom construction budget = 40% of $60 million = 0.4 * $60,000,000\n\nNow, doing the math:\n\n0.4 * $60,000,000 = $24,000,000\n\nSo, $24 million is allocated for room construction.\n\nNext is restaurant and kitchen facilities at 30%. Again, I'll convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply by the total cost.\n\nRestaurant and kitchen budget = 30% of $60 million = 0.3 * $60,000,000\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.3 * $60,000,000 = $18,000,000\n\nSo, $18 million is set aside for restaurants and kitchens.\n\nNow, recreational amenities make up 20% of the total cost.\n\nRecreational amenities budget = 20% of $60 million = 0.2 * $60,000,000\n\nWhich is:\n\n0.2 * $60,000,000 = $12,000,000\n\nSo, $12 million for recreational facilities.\n\nLastly, landscaping and other miscellaneous costs account for 10% of the total.\n\nLandscaping and miscellaneous budget = 10% of $60 million = 0.1 * $60,000,000\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.1 * $60,000,000 = $6,000,000\n\nSo, $6 million for landscaping and miscellaneous costs.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll add up all these individual budgets to ensure they total up to $60 million.\n\n$24,000,000 (rooms) + $18,000,000 (restaurants and kitchens) + $12,000,000 (recreational amenities) + $6,000,000 (landscaping and miscellaneous) = $60,000,000\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Room construction: $24 million\n\n- Restaurant and kitchen facilities: $18 million\n\n- Recreational amenities: $12 million\n\n- Landscaping and miscellaneous: $6 million\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. For example, could the cost per room be calculated, or is there any other aspect I should consider?\n\nWait, the problem doesn't ask for cost per room or any other details, so maybe that's unnecessary. The question is specifically about allocating the budget based on the given percentages, which I've done.\n\nAlternatively, if the numbers didn't add up to 100%, I'd need to account for the remaining percentage, but in this case, 40% + 30% + 20% + 10% = 100%, so everything is covered.\n\nI also noticed that the resort has 300 rooms, but that information isn't needed for calculating the budgets based on the given percentages. It might be relevant for other types of calculations, like cost per room, but again, that's not what's being asked here.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the individual budgets are correctly calculated as above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{Room construction:} & \\$24,000,000 \\\\\n\\text{Restaurant and kitchen facilities:} & \\$18,000,000 \\\\\n\\text{Recreational amenities:} & \\$12,000,000 \\\\\n\\text{Landscaping and miscellaneous:} & \\$6,000,000 \\\\\n\\end{array} } \\]"
