        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 12 balls. I need to find the probability of picking one ball of each color when I draw two balls without replacement.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I pick a ball, it stays out of the bag, so the total number of balls decreases by one after the first pick.\n\nNow, to find the probability of picking one of each color, I can think of it in two steps: picking a red first and then a blue, or picking a blue first and then a red. So, the total probability should be the sum of these two scenarios.\n\nLet me calculate the probability of picking a red first and then a blue.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/12.\n\nAfter picking a red ball, there are now 11 balls left in the bag, with 7 of them being blue. So, the probability of picking a blue ball next is 7/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red first and then a blue is (5/12) * (7/11).\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of picking a blue first and then a red.\n\nThe probability of picking a blue ball first is 7/12, since there are 7 blue balls out of 12 total balls.\n\nAfter picking a blue ball, there are now 11 balls left, with 5 of them being red. So, the probability of picking a red ball next is 5/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a blue first and then a red is (7/12) * (5/11).\n\nNow, to find the total probability of picking one ball of each color, I add these two probabilities together:\n\n(5/12 * 7/11) + (7/12 * 5/11)\n\nI notice that both terms are the same, just multiplied in a different order. So, I can factor this out.\n\nFirst, let's calculate one of them: 5/12 * 7/11 = (5*7)/(12*11) = 35/132\n\nSince both terms are equal, the total probability is 2*(35/132) = 70/132\n\nNow, I can simplify this fraction. Both 70 and 132 are divisible by 2.\n\n70 \u00f7 2 = 35\n\n132 \u00f7 2 = 66\n\nSo, 70/132 simplifies to 35/66.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking one ball of each color is 35/66.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this problem using combinations. The total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 12 is C(12,2), which is (12*11)/2 = 66.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one red and one blue ball is C(5,1)*C(7,1) = 5*7 = 35.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 35/66, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the final answer is 35/66.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{35}{66}} \\]"
