        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python script that uses the NumPy library to perform matrix multiplication on two user-provided matrices. The script includes input validation to ensure that the matrices can be multiplied and provides an error message if they cannot.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_matrix_from_user(matrix_name):\n    rows = int(input(f\"Enter the number of rows for {matrix_name}: \"))\n    cols = int(input(f\"Enter the number of columns for {matrix_name}: \"))\n    print(f\"Enter the elements of {matrix_name} row-wise:\")\n    elements = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        row = list(map(float, input().split()))\n        if len(row) != cols:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Incorrect number of columns in row {i+1} of {matrix_name}. Expected {cols}, got {len(row)}.\")\n        elements.extend(row)\n    return np.array(elements).reshape(rows, cols)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Matrix Multiplication Calculator\")\n    \n    try:\n        matrix_a = get_matrix_from_user(\"Matrix A\")\n        matrix_b = get_matrix_from_user(\"Matrix B\")\n        \n        if matrix_a.shape[1] != matrix_b.shape[0]:\n            print(\"Error: The number of columns in Matrix A must be equal to the number of rows in Matrix B for multiplication.\")\n            return\n        \n        result = np.dot(matrix_a, matrix_b)\n        print(\"Product of Matrix A and Matrix B:\")\n        print(result)\n    \n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The script prompts the user to enter the dimensions (rows and columns) for both Matrix A and Matrix B.\n   - It then asks the user to input the elements of each matrix row-wise.\n   - Input validation ensures that each row has the correct number of columns.\n\n2. **Matrix Multiplication:**\n   - The script checks if the number of columns in Matrix A is equal to the number of rows in Matrix B, which is a requirement for matrix multiplication.\n   - If the matrices can be multiplied, it uses NumPy's `dot` function to perform the multiplication and prints the result.\n   - If the matrices cannot be multiplied, it prints an error message.\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   - The script handles exceptions that may occur during input, such as incorrect numbers of columns in a row, and informs the user accordingly.\n\nThis script provides a user-friendly way to perform matrix multiplication with input validation and error handling."
