The name \"\u00e9clair\" comes from the French word for \"flash of lightning,\" which is quite interesting because the pastry is known for its quick preparation and the way it's made to look sleek and shiny, much like a lightning bolt. So, in a way, the name fits both the appearance and the quick nature of the pastry."
