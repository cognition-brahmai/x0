        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! Let's create a simple command-line calculator in Python that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll make sure it's user-friendly and handles basic operations efficiently.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The calculator will prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator.\n   - We need to ensure that the inputs are valid (e.g., numbers are actually numeric, and the operator is one of the supported operations).\n\n2. **Operation Functions:**\n   - We'll define functions for each operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n   - These functions will take two arguments (the numbers to operate on) and return the result.\n\n3. **Main Function:**\n   - This will be the driver function that ties everything together.\n   - It will handle user input, perform the desired operation using the appropriate function, and display the result.\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - We need to handle cases where the user inputs invalid numbers or operators.\n   - For division, we should also handle the case where the denominator is zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Add two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Subtract two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Multiply two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Divide two numbers, handling division by zero.\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero\"\n    else:\n        return x / y\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to run the calculator.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        operator = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n        \n        if operator == '+':\n            result = add(num1, num2)\n        elif operator == '-':\n            result = subtract(num1, num2)\n        elif operator == '*':\n            result = multiply(num1, num2)\n        elif operator == '/':\n            result = divide(num1, num2)\n        else:\n            result = \"Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\"\n        \n        print(\"Result:\", result)\n    \n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values for numbers.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Functions for Operations:**\n   - `add(x, y)`: Adds two numbers.\n   - `subtract(x, y)`: Subtracts the second number from the first.\n   - `multiply(x, y)`: Multiplies two numbers.\n   - `divide(x, y)`: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.\n\n2. **Main Function:**\n   - Prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator.\n   - Based on the operator, calls the corresponding function and displays the result.\n   - Handles invalid operators and non-numeric inputs using try-except blocks.\n\nThis simple calculator is a great starting point for understanding basic Python functions, input handling, and error management. You can expand upon this by adding more features like exponentiation, modulo operation, or even support for more complex expressions in the future."
