        "content": "So the restaurant has 4 types of appetizers, 6 main courses, and 3 desserts. I need to find out how many different three-course meals a customer can order, where each meal consists of one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a three-course meal means in this context. It means that the customer picks one item from each category: appetizer, main course, and dessert. So, the total number of different meals is the number of possible combinations of one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert.\n\nTo find the total number of combinations, I can use the fundamental counting principle. The fundamental counting principle states that if there are m ways to do one thing, and n ways to do another, then there are m multiplied by n ways to do both. This can be extended to more than two events.\n\nIn this case, there are three categories:\n\n1. Appetizers: 4 options\n\n2. Main courses: 6 options\n\n3. Desserts: 3 options\n\nSo, the total number of different three-course meals is 4 (appetizers) multiplied by 6 (main courses) multiplied by 3 (desserts).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3\n\nFirst, 4 \u00d7 6 is 24.\n\nThen, 24 \u00d7 3 is 72.\n\nTherefore, there are 72 different three-course meals that a customer can order.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using permutations or combinations?\n\nWell, in this case, since the order of the courses matters (appetizer first, then main course, then dessert), and each course is chosen from a different set, the fundamental counting principle is the most straightforward method.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it in terms of combinations, since we're choosing one item from each category, and the order within each category doesn't matter, but the order of the courses does, the fundamental counting principle still applies.\n\nI don't think permutations are necessary here because the items within each category are distinct, and we're not arranging them in any particular order beyond the sequence of the courses.\n\nSo, sticking with the fundamental counting principle, the answer should be 72 different three-course meals.\n\nIs there any chance that some items might be incompatible or that there are restrictions on certain combinations? The problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so I can assume that all combinations are possible.\n\nAlso, just to double-check, let's consider a smaller set. Suppose there are 2 appetizers, 3 main courses, and 2 desserts. Then, the total number of meals would be 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 12. That makes sense. Extending that to the original numbers, 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3 should indeed be 72.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 72 different three-course meals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
