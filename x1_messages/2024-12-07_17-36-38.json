The planet's atmosphere is rich in oxygen, making it breathable for many species. Massive crystalline structures jut out from the ground, creating natural spires and arches that dominate the landscape.\n\n**Inhabitants:** The native species are the Luminari, a peaceful race of sentient, plant-like beings that communicate through pheromones and bioluminescent signals. They live in harmony with the planet's unique ecosystem and possess advanced knowledge of botany and crystallography. In recent times, human colonists have established several research outposts to study the planet's unique resources.\n\n**Resource:** Xylophia-IV is renowned for its deposits of Eon Crystals, rare minerals that possess incredible energy storage capabilities. These crystals can hold vast amounts of energy and are highly sought after for advanced technology and power generation systems. The planet also exports various exotic plants and fungi with medicinal properties.\n\n**Anomaly:** The planet experiences periodic \"Crystal Storms,\" where the bioluminescent flora and the Eon Crystals resonate in synchrony, creating spectacular light shows and emitting powerful energy pulses. These events are both beautiful and dangerous, as the energy discharges can interfere with electronic devices and pose risks to unprotected visitors. The Luminari believe these storms are sacred and mark important cycles in their culture."
