        "content": "So, I've got this problem here about fencing a rectangular garden. The garden is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, and I need to figure out how much fencing is required to enclose it completely. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. So, in this case, there are two sides that are 15 meters each (the lengths) and two sides that are 8 meters each (the widths). To find out the total amount of fencing needed, I think I need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter is the total distance around the shape.\n\nI recall that the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width. So, plugging in the values here: P = 2(15) + 2(8). Let me do the math step by step.\n\nFirst, 2 times 15 is 30 meters. Then, 2 times 8 is 16 meters. Now, adding those together, 30 plus 16 equals 46 meters. So, the total perimeter is 46 meters.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can add the lengths of all four sides individually. So, 15 meters + 8 meters + 15 meters + 8 meters. That also gives me 15 + 8 = 23, and 23 + 15 = 38, and 38 + 8 = 46 meters. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle again to confirm. P = 2L + 2W = 2(15) + 2(8) = 30 + 16 = 46 meters. Yep, same answer.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, to enclose the garden completely, you'd need 46 meters of fencing.\n\nBut, let me think if there's any other aspect to consider. Is the garden on a slope or something? No, it's just a rectangular garden, so no need to account for any irregularities.\n\nAlso, does the fencing go around the exact perimeter, or is there any overlap or extra space needed? The question seems straightforward, asking for the fencing to enclose it completely, so I think the perimeter is the key here.\n\nAlright, I think 46 meters is the correct amount of fencing needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{46} \\]\n"
