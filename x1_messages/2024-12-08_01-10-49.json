He is noted for his novels \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" (1876) and its sequel, \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (1885), the latter often called the Great American Novel. Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, and he spent time as a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before finding success as a writer. His works are known for their wit, satire, and deep understanding of human nature, making him one of the most celebrated figures in American literature."
