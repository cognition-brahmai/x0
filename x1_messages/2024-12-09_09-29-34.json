        "content": "So I have this probability problem here. It says that I have a 50% chance of winning a game, and if I play the game twice, what's the probability that I will win at least once? Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least once\" means. It means that I could win once or twice, right? So, I need to find the probability of winning one game or both games.\n\nNow, I know that the probability of winning a single game is 50%, which is the same as 0.5. Since the games are independent, meaning the outcome of one doesn't affect the other, I can multiply the probabilities.\n\nBut wait, calculating it directly might be a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the complement of winning at least once. The complement would be winning none of the games, right? So, if I find the probability of losing both games and subtract that from 1, I should get the probability of winning at least once.\n\nOkay, let's try that. The probability of losing a single game is 1 minus the probability of winning, which is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n\nSince the games are independent, the probability of losing both games is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning at least once is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75, which is 75%.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to verify this? Maybe I can calculate the probability of winning exactly once and add it to the probability of winning exactly twice.\n\nFirst, the probability of winning exactly once. There are two scenarios for this: winning the first game and losing the second, or losing the first game and winning the second.\n\nThe probability of winning the first and losing the second is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of losing the first and winning the second is also 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\nSo, the total probability of winning exactly once is 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.\n\nNow, the probability of winning exactly twice is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning at least once is 0.5 (win once) + 0.25 (win twice) = 0.75 or 75%.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier using the complement method. So, I'm pretty confident that 75% is the correct answer.\n\nLet me just double-check. Is there any other way this could be interpreted? Suppose I consider the sequence of wins and losses. For two games, there are four possible outcomes:\n\n1. Win, Win\n\n2. Win, Lose\n\n3. Lose, Win\n\n4. Lose, Lose\n\nOut of these, the outcomes where I win at least once are 1, 2, and 3. So, three out of four outcomes have at least one win. Therefore, the probability is 3/4 = 0.75 or 75%.\n\nAlright, this lines up with both of the methods I used earlier. I think I've confirmed it thoroughly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.75} \\]"
