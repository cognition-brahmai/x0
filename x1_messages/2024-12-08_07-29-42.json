        "content": "To calculate the Nash equilibrium for a two-player game with given payoff matrices A and B, we need to find the strategies where neither player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy. Let's denote the two players as Player 1 (with payoff matrix A) and Player 2 (with payoff matrix B). The payoff matrices are:\n\nPlayer 1's payoff matrix A:\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nPlayer 2's payoff matrix B:\n\n\\[\nB = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Identify Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria\n\nFirst, we look for pure strategy Nash equilibria, where both players choose a single strategy.\n\n#### Player 1's Best Responses\n\nFor each of Player 2's strategies, determine Player 1's best response.\n\n- If Player 2 chooses strategy 1:\n\n  - Player 1's payoffs: A[:,0] = [3, 0]\n\n  - Player 1's best response is strategy 1 (payoff 3 > 0)\n\n- If Player 2 chooses strategy 2:\n\n  - Player 1's payoffs: A[:,1] = [1, 2]\n\n  - Player 1's best response is strategy 2 (payoff 2 > 1)\n\n#### Player 2's Best Responses\n\nFor each of Player 1's strategies, determine Player 2's best response.\n\n- If Player 1 chooses strategy 1:\n\n  - Player 2's payoffs: B[0,:] = [2, 0]\n\n  - Player 2's best response is strategy 1 (payoff 2 > 0)\n\n- If Player 1 chooses strategy 2:\n\n  - Player 2's payoffs: B[1,:] = [1, 3]\n\n  - Player 2's best response is strategy 2 (payoff 3 > 1)\n\n#### Find Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria\n\nLook for strategy pairs where both players are playing their best responses.\n\n- (Strategy 1, Strategy 1): Player 1's best response to Strategy 1 is Strategy 1, and Player 2's best response to Strategy 1 is Strategy 1. So, (1,1) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\n- (Strategy 2, Strategy 2): Player 1's best response to Strategy 2 is Strategy 2, and Player 2's best response to Strategy 2 is Strategy 2. So, (2,2) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nSo, we have two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (1,1) and (2,2).\n\n### Step 2: Check for Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria\n\nEven if there are pure strategy Nash equilibria, it's possible that there are mixed strategy Nash equilibria as well. We will check for mixed strategies where players randomize between their strategies.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Player 1 mixes between strategy 1 and strategy 2 with probabilities \\( p \\) and \\( 1 - p \\), respectively.\n\n- Player 2 mixes between strategy 1 and strategy 2 with probabilities \\( q \\) and \\( 1 - q \\), respectively.\n\n#### Player 1's Expected Payoff\n\nPlayer 1's expected payoff from choosing strategy 1:\n\n\\[\nu_1(1, q) = 3q + 1(1 - q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1\n\\]\n\nPlayer 1's expected payoff from choosing strategy 2:\n\n\\[\nu_1(2, q) = 0q + 2(1 - q) = 0 + 2 - 2q = 2 - 2q\n\\]\n\nFor Player 1 to be indifferent between strategies 1 and 2:\n\n\\[\n2q + 1 = 2 - 2q\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( q \\):\n\n\\[\n2q + 1 = 2 - 2q \\\\\n4q = 1 \\\\\nq = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n#### Player 2's Expected Payoff\n\nPlayer 2's expected payoff from choosing strategy 1:\n\n\\[\nu_2(p, 1) = 2p + 0(1 - p) = 2p + 0 = 2p\n\\]\n\nPlayer 2's expected payoff from choosing strategy 2:\n\n\\[\nu_2(p, 2) = 1p + 3(1 - p) = p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 2p\n\\]\n\nFor Player 2 to be indifferent between strategies 1 and 2:\n\n\\[\n2p = 3 - 2p\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( p \\):\n\n\\[\n2p = 3 - 2p \\\\\n4p = 3 \\\\\np = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n#### Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\nThe mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is when Player 1 plays strategy 1 with probability \\( p = \\frac{3}{4} \\) and strategy 2 with probability \\( 1 - p = \\frac{1}{4} \\), and Player 2 plays strategy 1 with probability \\( q = \\frac{1}{4} \\) and strategy 2 with probability \\( 1 - q = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Verify Nash Equilibria\n\nWe have found:\n\n1. Pure strategy Nash equilibria: (1,1) and (2,2)\n\n2. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: \\( p = \\frac{3}{4} \\), \\( q = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nLet's verify that in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, neither player can benefit by deviating unilaterally.\n\n#### Player 1's Payoffs in Mixed Equilibrium\n\n- Expected payoff from strategy 1: \\( 2q + 1 = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = 1.5 \\)\n\n- Expected payoff from strategy 2: \\( 2 - 2q = 2 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 \\)\n\nSince both strategies give the same expected payoff, Player 1 is indifferent and has no incentive to deviate.\n\n#### Player 2's Payoffs in Mixed Equilibrium\n\n- Expected payoff from strategy 1: \\( 2p = 2\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = 1.5 \\)\n\n- Expected payoff from strategy 2: \\( 3 - 2p = 3 - 2\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 \\)\n\nSimilarly, both strategies give the same expected payoff, so Player 2 has no incentive to deviate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe game has three Nash equilibria:\n\n1. Pure strategy Nash equilibrium where both players choose strategy 1.\n\n2. Pure strategy Nash equilibrium where both players choose strategy 2.\n\n3. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where Player 1 chooses strategy 1 with probability \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) and strategy 2 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), and Player 2 chooses strategy 1 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) and strategy 2 with probability \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Nash equilibria: (1,1), (2,2), and mixed strategies } \\left(p = \\frac{3}{4}, q = \\frac{1}{4}\\right)} \\]"
