        "content": "So there are 6 people in a room and they've collectively done 15 handshakes. Now, if one more person comes in, making it 7 people, how many handshakes would there be in total?\n\nFirst, I need to understand how many handshakes occur among 6 people. In a group where everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, the number of handshakes can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of people.\n\nSo for 6 people: C(6, 2) = 6*5/2 = 15 handshakes. That matches the given information.\n\nNow, if one more person enters, making it 7 people, the total number of handshakes would be C(7, 2) = 7*6/2 = 21 handshakes.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch here. The question says there are already 15 handshakes among the 6 people. When a 7th person enters, they will shake hands with each of the 6 existing people, adding 6 more handshakes.\n\nSo, total handshakes would be the original 15 plus the 6 new ones, totaling 21 handshakes.\n\nThis matches the combination calculation for 7 people.\n\nTherefore, if an additional person enters the room, there would be 21 handshakes in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
