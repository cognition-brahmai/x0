        "content": "Let's see. So, Tom, Jane, and Sam are taking turns picking cards from a deck of 52 cards, and they keep going in order: Tom, Jane, Sam, Tom, Jane, Sam, and so on, until all the cards are picked up. We need to figure out who picks up the last card.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of turns. Tom goes first, then Jane, then Sam, and this cycle repeats until all 52 cards are picked.\n\nEach player picks one card per turn, and they keep taking turns in this order.\n\nSo, the question is, who picks the 52nd card?\n\nTo find this out, I can think about the sequence of players and see where the 52nd turn falls.\n\nSince there are three players, the turns repeat every three turns: Tom (1), Jane (2), Sam (3), Tom (4), Jane (5), Sam (6), and so on.\n\nSo, to find out who picks the last card, I can divide the total number of cards by the number of players and see what the remainder is.\n\nIf I divide 52 by 3, I get:\n\n52 \u00f7 3 = 17 with a remainder of 1.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nIt means that there are 17 full cycles of Tom, Jane, Sam, which accounts for 17 \u00d7 3 = 51 cards.\n\nThen, there's one card left, which is the 52nd card.\n\nSince Tom is the first in the sequence, he would pick this remaining card.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nIn the first cycle, Tom picks card 1, Jane picks card 2, Sam picks card 3.\n\nIn the second cycle, Tom picks card 4, Jane picks card 5, Sam picks card 6.\n\nThis pattern continues until the 17th cycle, where Tom picks card 51 - no, wait:\n\nWait, actually, 17 cycles of 3 cards each would be 17 \u00d7 3 = 51 cards.\n\nSo, Tom picks cards 1, 4, 7, ..., up to card 52.\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet's list out the sequence:\n\nTurn 1: Tom picks card 1\n\nTurn 2: Jane picks card 2\n\nTurn 3: Sam picks card 3\n\nTurn 4: Tom picks card 4\n\nTurn 5: Jane picks card 5\n\nTurn 6: Sam picks card 6\n\n...\n\nTurn 51: ?\n\nTurn 52: ?\n\nWait, but there are only 52 cards.\n\nSo, after 17 cycles of 3 turns each, that's 51 turns, and then there's the 52nd turn.\n\nSo, turn 51 would be Sam, since it's the third in the cycle.\n\nThen, turn 52 would be Tom again.\n\nTherefore, Tom picks the 52nd card.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of remainders:\n\nWhen you divide 52 by 3, you get 17 with a remainder of 1.\n\nA remainder of 1 means that after complete cycles of 3, there's one extra turn.\n\nSince Tom is the first in the sequence, he gets that extra turn and picks the last card.\n\nSimilarly, if the remainder was 2, it would be Jane, and if the remainder was 0, it would be Sam.\n\nIn this case, remainder is 1, so Tom picks the last card.\n\nWait, but let's confirm this with another approach.\n\nLet me think about the positions each player picks.\n\nTom picks every 3rd turn, starting with the first turn.\n\nSo, Tom picks turns 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., up to turn 52.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 1, and the common difference d = 3.\n\nThe general term is a_n = 1 + (n-1)\u00d73 = 3n - 2.\n\nWe need to find the largest n such that a_n \u2264 52.\n\nSo, 3n - 2 \u2264 52\n\n3n \u2264 54\n\nn \u2264 18\n\nSo, Tom picks 18 cards, which would be turns 1, 4, 7, ..., up to turn 3\u00d718 - 2 = 52.\n\nTherefore, Tom picks turn 52, which is the last card.\n\nSimilarly, Jane picks turns 2, 5, 8, ..., up to turn 3\u00d717 - 1 = 50.\n\nSam picks turns 3, 6, 9, ..., up to turn 3\u00d717 = 51.\n\nThen, turn 52 is Tom's, which is the last card.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the total number of turns.\n\nTotal turns = total cards = 52.\n\nEach cycle consists of 3 turns: Tom, Jane, Sam.\n\nNumber of complete cycles = 52 \u00f7 3 = 17 cycles with a remainder of 1 turn.\n\nEach complete cycle covers Tom, Jane, Sam, and then the remainder is 1 turn, which goes to Tom.\n\nTherefore, Tom picks the last card.\n\nWait, but let me consider if the remainder was 2, who would pick the last card?\n\nFor example, if there were 53 cards, 53 \u00f7 3 = 17 with remainder 2.\n\nSo, 17 complete cycles, and then 2 extra turns: Tom and Jane.\n\nSo, Jane would pick the last card in that case.\n\nSimilarly, if there were 54 cards, 54 \u00f7 3 = 18 with remainder 0.\n\nSo, 18 complete cycles, and since the remainder is 0, Sam picks the last card.\n\nBack to our original problem with 52 cards, remainder 1, so Tom picks the last card.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to see that the last card corresponds to the player who picks on the turn equal to the total number of cards.\n\nSince total cards are 52, and Tom picks turns 1, 4, 7, ..., 52, as we saw earlier, Tom picks the 52nd card.\n\nTherefore, Tom picks up the last card.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Tom}} \\]"
