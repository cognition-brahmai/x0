        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So, in total, there are 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls in the bag. The problem is asking for the probability of drawing one ball of each color when you draw 3 balls without replacement.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what it means to draw without replacement. That means once I draw a ball, it stays out, and the next draw is from the remaining balls. So, the probabilities might change with each draw.\n\nNow, the event we're interested in is drawing one ball of each color: red, blue, and green. Since the order in which we draw them doesn't specify, I think the order doesn't matter here. So, I can consider the combination of balls rather than the permutation.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. One way is to calculate the total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 10, and then find the number of favorable outcomes, which are the sets of 3 balls that include one of each color.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 10 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to draw 3 balls from 10.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable combinations, which are the sets that have one red, one blue, and one green ball.\n\nGiven that there are 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green balls, the number of ways to choose one of each is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable combinations} = \\binom{5}{1} \\times \\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{2}{1} = 5 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 30 favorable ways to draw one ball of each color.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable combinations divided by the total number of combinations:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one of each color}) = \\frac{30}{120} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probabilities step by step, considering the draws without replacement.\n\nFor example, the probability of drawing a red ball first is 5/10, then a blue ball second is 3/9, and then a green ball third is 2/8. So, one sequence is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{red, then blue, then green}) = \\frac{5}{10} \\times \\frac{3}{9} \\times \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{5}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{120} = \\frac{1}{24}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, that's just one specific order. Since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible orders in which I can draw one of each color.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 possible orders: RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BGR, BRG.\n\nEach of these orders has the same probability, which is 1/24, as calculated above.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 6 \u00d7 (1/24) = 6/24 = 1/4 = 0.25.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this to confirm?\n\nLet's see. I could also use the concept of conditional probability.\n\nThe probability of drawing one of each color is equal to the probability of drawing a red ball, given that the other two are blue and green, but that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of ways to arrange the balls such that there's one of each color divided by the total number of ways to arrange any 3 balls from 10.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or exclusion that I'm not accounting for.\n\nIn this case, since we're drawing without replacement and looking for distinct colors, I don't think there's any overlap.\n\nAlso, ensuring that we're not double-counting any combinations.\n\nGiven that, I think the probability is indeed 1/4 or 25%.\n\nLet me check if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the hypergeometric distribution, which deals with sampling without replacement.\n\nThe hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X=k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\times \\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- N is the population size (10 balls)\n\n- K is the number of success states in the population (but in this case, we have multiple categories: red, blue, green)\n\n- n is the number of draws (3 balls)\n\n- k is the number of observed successes (but again, multiple colors)\n\nHmm, in this scenario, since we have three categories, the hypergeometric formula is a bit more complex.\n\nAlternatively, since I've already calculated it using combinations and gotten a consistent answer through another method, I'm fairly confident that 1/4 is the correct probability.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's think about another example.\n\nSuppose there are 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green balls, and we draw 3 balls without replacement.\n\nUsing the same method:\n\nTotal combinations: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n\nFavorable combinations: \\(\\binom{2}{1} \\times \\binom{2}{1} \\times \\binom{2}{1} = 8\\)\n\nSo, probability = 8/20 = 2/5 = 0.4\n\nAlternatively, step by step:\n\nP(R, then B, then G) = (2/6) * (2/5) * (2/4) = (2/6)*(2/5)*(1/2) = (2*2*1)/(6*5*2) = 4/60 = 1/15\n\nNumber of orders: 3! = 6\n\nTotal probability: 6*(1/15) = 6/15 = 2/5 = 0.4\n\nWhich matches the combination method.\n\nSo, in the original problem, I'm confident that 1/4 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.25} \\]"
