Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a singly linked list with insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Node Class\n\nFirst, we need a class to represent the nodes of the linked list. Each node will hold data and a reference to the next node in the list.\n\n```java\nclass Node {\n    int data;\n    Node next;\n\n    public Node(int data) {\n        this.data = data;\n        this.next = null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the SinglyLinkedList Class\n\nNext, we create a class to manage the linked list. This class will have methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.\n\n```java\npublic class SinglyLinkedList {\n    Node head; // head of list\n\n    // Constructor\n    public SinglyLinkedList() {\n        head = null;\n    }\n\n    // Method to insert a new node at the beginning\n    public void insertAtBeginning(int data) {\n        Node newNode = new Node(data);\n        newNode.next = head;\n        head = newNode;\n    }\n\n    // Method to insert a new node at the end\n    public void insertAtEnd(int data) {\n        Node newNode = new Node(data);\n\n        if (head == null) {\n            head = newNode;\n            return;\n        }\n\n        Node last = head;\n        while (last.next != null) {\n            last = last.next;\n        }\n        last.next = newNode;\n    }\n\n    // Method to delete a node given its data\n    public void deleteNode(int data) {\n        Node temp = head, prev = null;\n\n        if (temp != null && temp.data == data) {\n            head = temp.next;\n            return;\n        }\n\n        while (temp != null && temp.data != data) {\n            prev = temp;\n            temp = temp.next;\n        }\n\n        if (temp == null) return;\n\n        prev.next = temp.next;\n    }\n\n    // Method to traverse and print the list\n    public void traverse() {\n        Node current = head;\n        while (current != null) {\n            System.out.print(current.data + \" -> \");\n            current = current.next;\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"null\");\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SinglyLinkedList list = new SinglyLinkedList();\n\n        list.insertAtEnd(1);\n        list.insertAtBeginning(2);\n        list.insertAtEnd(3);\n        list.insertAtBeginning(4);\n        list.traverse(); // Output: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> null\n\n        list.deleteNode(2);\n        list.traverse(); // Output: 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> null\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Node Class**: This class represents each element in the linked list. Each node contains an integer data field and a next field that points to the next node in the list.\n\n2. **SinglyLinkedList Class**:\n   - **head**: This is a reference to the first node in the list.\n   - **insertAtBeginning(int data)**: Inserts a new node with the given data at the beginning of the list.\n   - **insertAtEnd(int data)**: Inserts a new node with the given data at the end of the list.\n   - **deleteNode(int data)**: Deletes the first occurrence of the node with the given data.\n   - **traverse()**: Prints the data of all nodes in the list.\n\n3. **main Method**: Demonstrates the usage of the SinglyLinkedList class by inserting nodes, deleting a node, and traversing the list to print its elements.\n\nThis should give you a basic implementation of a singly linked list in Java with the specified operations.
