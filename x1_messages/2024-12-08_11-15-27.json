        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to create a Python program that does basic CRUD operations for managing a collection of books, and I need to store the data in SQLite. So, first things first, I need to understand what CRUD operations are and how SQLite works with Python.\n\nCRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the basic operations you can perform on data in a database. So, for this program, I need to allow users to add new books, view existing books, update book information, and delete books.\n\nNow, SQLite is a relational database management system. It's lightweight and doesn't require a separate server process. It's perfect for small to medium applications like this one. Python has a built-in module called `sqlite3` that allows us to work with SQLite databases easily.\n\nLet me start by planning out the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Set up the database and table:**\n\n- Create a new SQLite database.\n\n- Create a table to store book information with columns for title, author, and publication year.\n\n2. **Implement the CRUD operations:**\n\n- **Create:** Add a new book to the table.\n\n- **Read:** Retrieve and display book(s) from the table.\n\n- **Update:** Modify the information of an existing book.\n\n- **Delete:** Remove a book from the table.\n\n3. **Create a simple user interface:**\n\n- Allow the user to choose which operation they want to perform.\n\n- Handle user inputs and display appropriate messages.\n\nLet me think about the table structure first. Each book will have a title, an author, and a publication year. I should also consider having a unique identifier for each book, maybe an ID, which can be automatically generated.\n\nSo, the table might look like this:\n\n- id (integer, primary key, auto-increment)\n\n- title (text)\n\n- author (text)\n\n- year (integer)\n\nNow, I need to write the SQL commands to create this table.\n\nNext, I need to think about how to implement each CRUD operation.\n\n**Create:**\n\n- The user inputs the title, author, and publication year.\n\n- I insert these values into the table.\n\n**Read:**\n\n- Perhaps allow the user to view all books or search for a specific book by title or author.\n\n**Update:**\n\n- The user specifies which book to update by its ID.\n\n- Then, they can change the title, author, or publication year.\n\n**Delete:**\n\n- The user specifies the book ID to delete.\n\nI also need to handle potential errors, like trying to update or delete a book that doesn't exist.\n\nFor the user interface, I can use a simple command-line interface where the user selects an option from a menu.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the program structure in code.\n\nI'll need to import the `sqlite3` module to work with the database.\n\nThen, I'll establish a connection to the database and create a cursor object to execute SQL commands.\n\nFirst, I'll create the database and table if they don't exist.\n\nThen, I'll create functions for each CRUD operation.\n\nFinally, I'll create a loop that displays a menu to the user and calls the appropriate function based on their choice.\n\nLet me think about the functions one by one.\n\n**Create Function:**\n\n- Prompt the user to enter the title, author, and year.\n\n- Use an SQL INSERT statement to add the book to the table.\n\n- Commit the changes to the database.\n\n**Read Function:**\n\n- Option 1: Display all books.\n\n- Option 2: Search for a book by title or author.\n\n- For displaying all books, use a SELECT * FROM books statement.\n\n- For searching, allow the user to enter a keyword and search in the title and author fields.\n\n**Update Function:**\n\n- Ask the user for the book ID they want to update.\n\n- Then, ask which field they want to update: title, author, or year.\n\n- Get the new value from the user and update the corresponding field in the database.\n\n**Delete Function:**\n\n- Ask for the book ID to delete.\n\n- Use a DELETE FROM books WHERE id = ? statement.\n\n- Confirm with the user before deleting.\n\nI should also think about how to handle user inputs to prevent SQL injection. Using parameterized queries is a good practice.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that the publication year is entered as an integer and handle any conversion errors.\n\nLet me consider how to structure the menu.\n\nPerhaps display options like:\n\n1. Add a new book\n\n2. View all books\n\n3. Search for a book\n\n4. Update a book\n\n5. Delete a book\n\n6. Exit\n\nThen, based on the user's choice, call the corresponding function.\n\nI need to handle invalid choices as well, by displaying an error message and prompting again.\n\nAlso, after each operation, I might want to pause the program to let the user see the result before clearing the screen or continuing.\n\nWait, but in a command-line interface, it's better to display the result and then return to the menu.\n\nI should also think about how to display the books. Maybe format the output in a table-like structure for better readability.\n\nLet me consider using the prettytable module to display the books in a tabular format. But since the task says to use plain Python, I should stick to built-in modules.\n\nSo, I can format the output using strings and print statements.\n\nLet me think about the flow of the program.\n\nFirst, establish the database connection and create the table if it doesn't exist.\n\nThen, display the menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit.\n\nInside the loop:\n\n- Display the menu options.\n\n- Get user input for the choice.\n\n- Based on the choice, call the corresponding function.\n\n- Handle any errors or invalid inputs.\n\n- Display a message indicating the operation was successful or not.\n\n- Wait for the user to press Enter to continue.\n\nFinally, when the user chooses to exit, commit any pending changes and close the database connection.\n\nI should also handle exceptions, like database errors, and make sure the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.\n\nLet me think about the data validation.\n\n- For the title and author, they should be strings.\n\n- For the year, it should be an integer within a reasonable range, say 1000 to the current year.\n\n- For the ID, it's automatically generated, so the user doesn't need to input it.\n\nI need to make sure that the user can't add a book with an existing ID, but since ID is auto-incremented, it should be unique.\n\nWait, in SQLite, if I define the ID column as INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, it will handle the auto-incrementing.\n\nSo, I don't need to worry about assigning IDs manually.\n\nThat's convenient.\n\nNow, for the update and delete functions, I need to make sure that the specified ID exists in the database before performing the operation.\n\nI can do this by querying the database for a book with that ID and checking if any rows are returned.\n\nIf not, display an error message saying the book doesn't exist.\n\nOtherwise, proceed with the update or delete.\n\nFor the search function, I need to allow the user to enter a keyword and search for books where the title or author contains that keyword.\n\nI can use the LIKE operator in SQL for this purpose.\n\nFor example, SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%keyword%' OR author LIKE '%keyword%'\n\nI need to handle the wildcards in the SQL query.\n\nAlso, I should consider making the search case-insensitive.\n\nIn SQLite, the LIKE operator is case-insensitive by default.\n\nWait, no. In SQLite, the LIKE operator is case-sensitive by default.\n\nTo make it case-insensitive, I can use the COLLATE NOCASE option.\n\nSo, the query would be:\n\nSELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%keyword%' COLLATE NOCASE OR author LIKE '%keyword%' COLLATE NOCASE\n\nThat should do it.\n\nNow, let me think about how to display the books.\n\nSuppose I have a list of books, each with id, title, author, and year.\n\nI can print a header row with column names, and then print each book's information in a row.\n\nI need to align the columns properly.\n\nMaybe use fixed widths for each column.\n\nFor example:\n\nID   Title                 Author                Year\n\n1    The Great Gatsby     F. Scott Fitzgerald   1925\n\n2    To Kill a Mockingbird Harper Lee           1960\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can use the ljust() or rjust() string methods to align the text.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the format() function with alignment specifiers.\n\nLet me consider using format() for better control over the output.\n\nFor example:\n\nprint(\"{:<5} {:<20} {:<20} {:<5}\".format('ID', 'Title', 'Author', 'Year'))\n\nThen, for each book:\n\nprint(\"{:<5} {:<20} {:<20} {:<5}\".format(book[0], book[1], book[2], book[3]))\n\nThis should align the columns nicely.\n\nNow, for the create function, I need to get input from the user for title, author, and year.\n\nI can use the input() function for this.\n\nFor the year, I need to make sure it's an integer.\n\nSo, I'll try to convert the input to an integer and handle any ValueError exceptions.\n\nSimilarly, for the update function, I need to get the book ID, choose which field to update, and get the new value.\n\nI need to validate that the ID exists before proceeding with the update.\n\nFor the delete function, I need to get the book ID and confirm before deleting.\n\nI can ask the user to confirm by entering 'yes' or 'no'.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nI'll need to have the following functions:\n\n- create_book()\n\n- read_all_books()\n\n- search_books()\n\n- update_book()\n\n- delete_book()\n\n- main()\n\nIn the main() function, I'll set up the database, display the menu, and handle user choices.\n\nI need to make sure that the database connection is closed properly when the program exits.\n\nI can use a try-finally block to ensure that the connection is closed, regardless of how the program exits.\n\nAlso, I should commit the transactions after each CRUD operation to make sure the changes are saved.\n\nNow, let's think about the database setup.\n\nI need to create a database file, say \"books.db\", and a table named \"books\" with the columns I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe SQL command for creating the table would be:\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (\n\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\n    title TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    author TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n    year INTEGER NOT NULL\n\n)\n\nI can execute this command when the program starts.\n\nNow, let's think about the create_book() function.\n\nI need to get the title, author, and year from the user.\n\nThen, insert these values into the books table.\n\nThe SQL command would be:\n\nINSERT INTO books (title, author, year) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\n\nI'll use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.\n\nSimilarly, for read_all_books(), I'll execute:\n\nSELECT * FROM books\n\nAnd then print the results in a formatted table.\n\nFor search_books(), I'll get a keyword from the user, and execute:\n\nSELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE ? OR author LIKE ?\n\nWith the wildcard characters added to the keyword.\n\nFor update_book(), I'll get the book ID from the user, then ask which field to update and get the new value.\n\nThen, execute an UPDATE statement like:\n\nUPDATE books SET title = ? WHERE id = ?\n\nDepending on which field is being updated.\n\nFor delete_book(), I'll get the book ID, confirm with the user, and then execute:\n\nDELETE FROM books WHERE id = ?\n\nNow, I need to think about how to handle user inputs and validate them.\n\nFor example, in create_book(), I need to make sure that the year is a valid integer.\n\nI can use a while loop to keep asking for input until it's valid.\n\nSimilarly, in update_book(), I need to make sure that the ID exists before allowing the update.\n\nI can write a helper function to check if a book with a given ID exists.\n\nSimilarly, in delete_book(), I need to confirm before deleting.\n\nI can ask the user to enter 'yes' or 'no', and proceed accordingly.\n\nLet me also think about how to handle errors during database operations.\n\nFor example, if there's an issue with the database connection or executing a query, I should catch the exceptions and display an error message to the user.\n\nNow, let's think about the menu display.\n\nI can define a function called display_menu() that prints the menu options and returns the user's choice.\n\nIn the main() function, I'll call display_menu() in a loop until the user chooses to exit.\n\nI need to make sure that the user can only choose from the available options.\n\nSo, I'll validate the input and prompt again if an invalid choice is made.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the code file.\n\nI can have the following sections:\n\n- Import necessary modules (sqlite3)\n\n- Database setup function\n\n- CRUD functions\n\n- Helper functions (e.g., check if book exists)\n\n- Menu display function\n\n- Main function\n\n- If __name__ == \"__main__\": call main()\n\nThis is a standard structure for Python programs.\n\nNow, let me start writing some pseudocode to get a better idea.\n\nFirst, database setup:\n\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef setup_database():\n\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('books.db')\n\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books\n\n                 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n\n                  title TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n                  author TEXT NOT NULL,\n\n                  year INTEGER NOT NULL)''')\n\n    conn.commit()\n\n    return conn\n\nThen, create_book():\n\ndef create_book(conn):\n\n    title = input(\"Enter the title: \")\n\n    author = input(\"Enter the author: \")\n\n    while True:\n\n        try:\n\n            year = int(input(\"Enter the publication year: \"))\n\n            break\n\n        except ValueError:\n\n            print(\"Invalid year. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    c.execute(\"INSERT INTO books (title, author, year) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\", (title, author, year))\n\n    conn.commit()\n\n    print(\"Book added successfully.\")\n\nSimilarly, read_all_books():\n\ndef read_all_books(conn):\n\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    c.execute(\"SELECT * FROM books\")\n\n    books = c.fetchall()\n\n    if len(books) == 0:\n\n        print(\"No books found.\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"{:<5} {:<20} {:<20} {:<5}\".format('ID', 'Title', 'Author', 'Year'))\n\n        for book in books:\n\n            print(\"{:<5} {:<20} {:<20} {:<5}\".format(book[0], book[1], book[2], book[3]))\n\nFor search_books():\n\ndef search_books(conn):\n\n    keyword = input(\"Enter a keyword to search: \")\n\n    keyword = '%' + keyword + '%'\n\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    c.execute(\"SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE ?

Title\")\n\n    print(\"2. Author\")\n\n    print(\"3.

Please enter a number.\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"Invalid choice.\")\n\n        return\n\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    c.execute(f\"UPDATE books SET {field} = ? WHERE id = ?\", (new_value, book_id))\n\n    conn.commit()\n\n    print(\"Book updated successfully.\")\n\nFor delete_book():\n\ndef delete_book(conn):\n\n    book_id = input(\"Enter the book ID to delete: \")\n\n    if not is_book_exists(conn, book_id):\n\n        print(\"Book not found.\")\n\n        return\n\n    confirm = input(\"Are you sure you want to delete this book?

Add a new book\")\n\n    print(\"2. View all books\")\n\n    print(\"3. Search for a book\")\n\n    print(\"4. Update a book\")\n\n    print(\"5. Delete a book\")\n\n    print(\"6.

Please try again.\")\n\n        input(\"Press Enter to continue...\")\n\n    conn.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nThis looks like a solid plan. Now, I need to write the actual code based on this pseudocode.\n\nI should also think about testing the program.\n\nI need to test each CRUD operation to make sure they work as expected.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Add a few books and verify they are stored correctly.\n\n- View all books and check if they are displayed properly.\n\n- Search for books using different keywords and ensure the search is case-insensitive.\n\n- Update book information and confirm the changes are saved.\n\n- Delete a book and confirm it's removed from the database.\n\nI should also test edge cases, like:\n\n- Entering invalid inputs for the year.\n\n- Trying to update or delete a non-existent book.\n\n- Searching with keywords that don't match any books.\n\nI need to make sure the program handles these situations gracefully without crashing.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the user experience.\n\n- Make sure the menu is clear and easy to understand.\n\n- Provide helpful messages and feedback to the user.\n\n- Avoid redundant or confusing prompts.\n\nI might also want to add some formatting to make the output look nicer, but since the task specifies plain Python, I'll keep it simple.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the actual code based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a Python program that implements basic CRUD operations for managing a collection of books using SQLite, follow the steps below.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef setup_database():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('books.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books\n                 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n                  title TEXT NOT NULL,\n                  author TEXT NOT NULL,\n                  year INTEGER NOT NULL)''')\n    conn.commit()\n    return conn\n\ndef create_book(conn):\n    title = input(\"Enter the title: \")\n    author = input(\"Enter the author: \")\n    while True:\n        try:\n            year = int(input(\"Enter the publication year: \"))\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid year.

It provides a command-line interface for performing CRUD operations:\n\n1. **Create**: Adds a new book to the database.\n2. **Read**: Views all books or searches for books by keyword.\n3. **Update**: Updates the title, author, or year of an existing book.\n4. **Delete**: Removes a book from the database.\n\nThe program sets up an SQLite database and a table to store book information. It includes functions for each CRUD operation and a menu system for user interaction. The code ensures data integrity and provides a simple, text-based interface for managing books."
