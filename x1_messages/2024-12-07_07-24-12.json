The park's management estimates that 70% of visitors will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. On average, the park has 5,000 visitors per day during peak season. Calculate the number of riders per hour the roller coaster must accommodate to avoid long wait times, considering the park's operating hours are from 10 am to 10 pm. Additionally, estimate the number of roller coaster cars needed if each car can hold up to 6 passengers and takes 3 minutes to complete the ride."

        "content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about designing a roller coaster at an amusement park. The main things I need to figure out are:\n\n1. How many riders per hour the roller coaster needs to handle to keep wait times manageable.\n\n2. How many roller coaster cars are needed, given that each car holds up to 6 passengers and takes 3 minutes to complete the ride.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints and the given data:\n\n- Height restriction: 48 inches, which allows 70% of visitors to ride.\n\n- Average visitors per day: 5,000\n\n- Operating hours: 10 am to 10 pm, which is 12 hours a day.\n\nFrom this, I can calculate the total number of potential riders per day and then find out how many need to be accommodated per hour.\n\nLet's start by finding out how many visitors are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. Since 70% of visitors meet the height requirement:\n\nNumber of potential riders per day = 5,000 visitors/day * 70% = 3,500 riders/day\n\nNow, the park operates for 12 hours a day, from 10 am to 10 pm. So, to find the number of riders per hour, I'll divide the total daily riders by the number of operating hours:\n\nRiders per hour = 3,500 riders/day / 12 hours/day \u2248 291.67 riders/hour\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a rider, I'll round this to 292 riders per hour.\n\nNow, to avoid long wait times, the roller coaster needs to be able to handle at least this number of riders per hour. So, the roller coaster must accommodate at least 292 riders per hour.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the number of roller coaster cars needed. Each car holds up to 6 passengers and takes 3 minutes to complete the ride.\n\nFirst, I need to determine how many rides the roller coaster can operate per hour. Since each ride takes 3 minutes, the number of rides per hour is:\n\nNumber of rides per hour = 60 minutes/hour / 3 minutes/ride = 20 rides/hour\n\nEach ride can carry 6 passengers, so the total number of passengers per hour that one car can handle is:\n\nPassengers per hour per car = 20 rides/hour * 6 passengers/ride = 120 passengers/hour\n\nNow, to find out how many cars are needed to handle the required 292 riders per hour, I'll divide the total required riders per hour by the number of passengers one car can handle per hour:\n\nNumber of cars needed = 292 riders/hour / 120 passengers/hour/car \u2248 2.433 cars\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a car, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the roller coaster needs at least 3 cars to handle the expected number of riders per hour.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If one car can handle 120 passengers per hour, then two cars could handle 240 passengers per hour, which is less than the required 292 passengers. Three cars would handle 360 passengers per hour, which is more than enough.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any downtime between rides or other factors that might affect the throughput. But based on the information given, assuming the rides are continuous with no downtime, three cars should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the capacity in terms of the number of passengers per cycle.\n\nLet me think differently. If each car holds 6 passengers and takes 3 minutes per ride, then in one cycle (which is 3 minutes), one car can transport 6 passengers.\n\nIn one hour, which has 60 minutes, the number of cycles per car is 60 / 3 = 20 cycles per hour.\n\nTherefore, per car, the hourly capacity is 20 cycles/hour * 6 passengers/cycle = 120 passengers/hour.\n\nAs before, to handle 292 passengers per hour, the number of cars required is 292 / 120 \u2248 2.433, which rounds up to 3 cars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the total ride time including any loading and unloading times, but since that information isn't provided, I'll assume that the 3 minutes per ride includes all such factors.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total number of rides needed per hour and then determine how many cars are required to accommodate that.\n\nTotal riders per hour: 292\n\nPassengers per ride per car: 6\n\nNumber of rides needed per hour: 292 / 6 \u2248 48.67 rides/hour\n\nSince each car can complete 20 rides per hour, the number of cars needed is 48.67 rides/hour / 20 rides/hour/car \u2248 2.433 cars, again rounding up to 3 cars.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that 3 cars are needed.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the park's perspective of avoiding long wait times. Maybe they want to have shorter wait times, so they might need more cars.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, the calculation suggests that 3 cars are sufficient to handle the 292 riders per hour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the theoretical maximum number of riders per hour based on 3 cars and see if it meets the requirement.\n\nWith 3 cars, each doing 20 rides per hour, the total number of rides per hour is 3 * 20 = 60 rides/hour.\n\nEach ride carries 6 passengers, so total passengers per hour is 60 rides/hour * 6 passengers/ride = 360 passengers/hour.\n\nSince the required number is 292 passengers/hour, 3 cars can handle this with some buffer.\n\nTherefore, the roller coaster needs to have at least 3 cars to accommodate the expected number of riders per hour and avoid long wait times.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The roller coaster must accommodate at least 292 riders per hour.\n\n- To achieve this, the roller coaster needs at least 3 cars, each holding up to 6 passengers and taking 3 minutes per ride.\n\nI think that's the answer to the problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
