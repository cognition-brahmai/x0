        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a factory that cranks out 200 widgets every hour. Each of these widgets has to go through three quality control checkpoints. At each checkpoint, 10% of the widgets get rejected. We need to find out how many widgets make it through all three checkpoints and get packaged for shipment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens at each checkpoint. If 10% are rejected, that means 90% are accepted and move on to the next checkpoint. So, for each checkpoint, the passage rate is 90%, or 0.9 in decimal form.\n\nStarting with 200 widgets:\n\n1. After the first checkpoint, 90% of 200 widgets pass through.\n\nLet me calculate that: 200 * 0.9 = 180 widgets.\n\n2. These 180 widgets now go to the second checkpoint. Again, 90% pass through.\n\nSo, 180 * 0.9 = 162 widgets.\n\n3. Finally, these 162 widgets go to the third checkpoint, and again, 90% pass through.\n\nSo, 162 * 0.9 = 145.8 widgets.\n\nNow, we can't have a fraction of a widget, so in reality, this would probably be rounded to 146 widgets, assuming we round up. But since it's a hypothetical problem, I'll keep it at 145.8 for now.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a more efficient way to calculate this without doing it step by step. Since each checkpoint has a 90% passage rate, and there are three checkpoints, maybe I can just multiply the initial number of widgets by 0.9 three times, which is the same as multiplying by 0.9^3.\n\nLet me check: 0.9^3 = 0.729.\n\nSo, 200 * 0.729 = 145.8 widgets.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, 145.8 widgets make it through all three checkpoints.\n\nBut again, since we can't have a fraction of a widget, we might need to round this number. If we round down, it's 145; if we round up, it's 146. Depending on the factory's policy, they might round differently, but since 0.8 is closer to 1 than to 0, it's more common to round up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory deals with averages, so over time, the fraction makes sense.\n\nBut for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that they round to the nearest whole number, which would be 146 widgets.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I got 145.8, which is closer to 146. But to be precise, let's consider that in each step, the rejection rate is exactly 10%, so the passage rate is exactly 90%.\n\nStarting with 200:\n\nFirst checkpoint: 200 * 0.9 = 180.\n\nSecond checkpoint: 180 * 0.9 = 162.\n\nThird checkpoint: 162 * 0.9 = 145.8.\n\nSo, indeed, 145.8 widgets pass all three checkpoints.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it in terms of probabilities. Each widget has a 0.9 probability of passing each checkpoint independently. So, the probability of passing all three checkpoints is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of widgets passing all three checkpoints is 200 * 0.729 = 145.8.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, you can't have 0.8 of a widget, so the factory would likely round to the nearest whole number. But since the problem doesn't specify rounding, and considering that it's an expected value, it's acceptable to leave it as 145.8.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's expected to round to a whole number. If so, 145.8 rounds to 146 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the factory discards any fraction of a widget, in which case they would package 145 widgets.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the number of widgets successfully packaged after passing all three checkpoints, and without specifying rounding rules, I'll stick with the precise calculation of 145.8 widgets.\n\nBut considering that the number of widgets must be a whole number, and that you can't package a fraction of a widget, perhaps the correct answer is 145 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factory considers any widget that has passed all three checkpoints, even if it's a fraction, as still being a complete widget. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rejection rate is not exactly 10%, but varies, and over time, the average is 10% rejected, leading to an average of 145.8 widgets passing.\n\nBut in the context of this problem, I think the expected number is 145.8, which should be rounded to 146 widgets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solving this problem.\n\nLet me consider the number of widgets rejected at each stage.\n\nAt the first checkpoint, 10% of 200 are rejected: 200 * 0.1 = 20 widgets rejected.\n\nSo, 200 - 20 = 180 widgets pass to the second checkpoint.\n\nAt the second checkpoint, 10% of 180 are rejected: 180 * 0.1 = 18 widgets rejected.\n\nSo, 180 - 18 = 162 widgets pass to the third checkpoint.\n\nAt the third checkpoint, 10% of 162 are rejected: 162 * 0.1 = 16.2 widgets rejected.\n\nSo, 162 - 16.2 = 145.8 widgets pass all three checkpoints.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of series of independent events.\n\nSince each checkpoint is an independent event with a 90% passage rate, the overall passage rate is 0.9^3 = 0.729.\n\nTherefore, 200 * 0.729 = 145.8 widgets pass all three checkpoints.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the answer remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the number of widgets successfully packaged for shipment after passing all three checkpoints in one hour is 146 widgets, assuming rounding to the nearest whole number.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{146} \\]"
