However, if you're asking about the closest galaxy to Earth, that would be the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, which is approximately 25,000 light-years away. But, if you're considering galaxies outside of the Milky Way, then the Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest major galaxy, located about 2.5 million light-years from us."
