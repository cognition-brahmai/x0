        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a farmer has 15 sheep and 9 goats, and I need to figure out how many legs there are in total among all the animals. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many legs each type of animal has. I think sheep and goats are both four-legged animals. So, each sheep has 4 legs, and each goat has 4 legs too.\n\nOkay, so if there are 15 sheep, and each has 4 legs, then the total number of legs for the sheep would be 15 times 4. Let me calculate that: 15 times 4 is 60. So, the sheep have 60 legs in total.\n\nNext, the goats. There are 9 goats, each with 4 legs. So, 9 times 4 is 36. Therefore, the goats have 36 legs in total.\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs among all the animals, I need to add the legs of the sheep and the legs of the goats together. That would be 60 plus 36, which equals 96.\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Are there any other factors to consider? For example, do the farmer's legs count too? Hmm, the problem says \"all the animals,\" so probably not. It's just the sheep and goats.\n\nAlso, I assumed that all the animals have all their legs intact, which is probably a safe assumption unless otherwise stated.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the total number of legs among all the animals is 96.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]"
