        "content": "To solve this problem, I need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array of integers, and I need to do it efficiently, with a time complexity of O(n log n). I know that there are various ways to approach this problem, but not all of them meet the efficiency requirement.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, in the array [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80], one possible increasing subsequence is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80].\n\nThe naive approach to finding the LIS would be to consider all possible subsequences and pick the longest one that is strictly increasing. However, this approach would have a time complexity of O(2^n), which is too slow for large arrays.\n\nI recall that there is a dynamic programming approach that can find the LIS in O(n^2) time. In this approach, I can create an array to store the length of the LIS ending at each index. For each element, I would check all previous elements and see if I can extend the subsequence ending at that previous element.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the dynamic programming approach:\n\n1. Initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the LIS ending at index `i`. Initialize all `dp[i]` to 1 since the minimum LIS length is 1 (the element itself).\n\n2. For each `i` from 1 to n-1:\n\na. For each `j` from 0 to i-1:\n\ni. If `arr[i] > arr[j]`, then `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`\n\n3. The length of the LIS is the maximum value in the `dp` array.\n\nThis approach works, but it's O(n^2), which doesn't meet the O(n log n) requirement. So, I need a better way.\n\nI remember that there is an efficient algorithm for finding the LIS in O(n log n) time. It uses a combination of dynamic programming and binary search. The idea is to maintain a list of the smallest tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- Initialize an empty list `tails`, where `tails[i]` represents the smallest tail value of all increasing subsequences with length `i+1`.\n\n- Iterate through each element in the input array:\n\n- Use binary search to find the index in `tails` where the current element can be placed.\n\n- If the element is larger than any in `tails`, append it to `tails`.\n\n- Otherwise, replace the existing value at the found index with the current element.\n\n- The length of `tails` at the end of the iteration is the length of the LIS.\n\nThis approach is more efficient because binary search reduces the time complexity to O(n log n).\n\nLet me try to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the case when the input array is empty or has only one element.\n\nIf the array is empty, the LIS is 0.\n\nIf the array has one element, the LIS is 1.\n\nFor longer arrays, I'll proceed with the algorithm as described.\n\nLet's consider an example to see how this works.\n\nTake the array: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]\n\nInitialize `tails` as empty.\n\n- For 10: `tails` is empty, so append 10. `tails = [10]`\n\n- For 9: 9 < 10, so replace 10 with 9. `tails = [9]`\n\n- For 2: 2 < 9, so replace 9 with 2. `tails = [2]`\n\n- For 5: 5 > 2, so append 5. `tails = [2, 5]`\n\n- For 3: 3 > 2 and 3 < 5, so replace 5 with 3. `tails = [2, 3]`\n\n- For 7: 7 > 3, so append 7. `tails = [2, 3, 7]`\n\n- For 101: 101 > 7, so append 101. `tails = [2, 3, 7, 101]`\n\n- For 18: 18 < 101, so replace 101 with 18. `tails = [2, 3, 7, 18]`\n\nThe length of `tails` is 4, which is the length of the LIS.\n\nTo reconstruct the actual LIS, I would need to keep track of the predecessors or maintain additional data structures, but since the problem only asks for the length, I can stop here.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in JavaScript or TypeScript. I'll choose TypeScript for its type safety.\n\nI need to use binary search to find the index at which to place the current element in `tails`. TypeScript has the `Array.prototype.findIndex` method, but it's better to implement a standard binary search for efficiency.\n\nHere's a plan for the function:\n\n- Define a function `lengthOfLIS` that takes an array of integers `nums`.\n\n- If `nums` is empty, return 0.\n\n- Initialize an empty array `tails`.\n\n- Iterate through each number in `nums`:\n\n- Use binary search to find the index at which to place the current number in `tails`.\n\n- If the index is equal to the length of `tails`, append the number to `tails`.\n\n- Else, replace the element at that index with the current number.\n\n- After processing all numbers, return the length of `tails`.\n\nI need to implement the binary search correctly to ensure that `tails` remains sorted.\n\nLet me write some pseudocode first:\n\nfunction lengthOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {\n\nif (nums.length === 0) return 0;\n\nlet tails: number[] = [];\n\nfor (let num of nums) {\n\nlet index = binarySearch(tails, num);\n\nif (index === tails.length) {\n\ntails.push(num);\n\n} else {\n\ntails[index] = num;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn tails.length;\n\n}\n\nfunction binarySearch(tails: number[], key: number): number {\n\nlet left = 0;\n\nlet right = tails.length - 1;\n\nwhile (left <= right) {\n\nlet mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);\n\nif (tails[mid] < key) {\n\nleft = mid + 1;\n\n} else {\n\nright = mid - 1;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn left;\n\n}\n\nThis looks similar to the algorithm I described earlier. Now, I need to ensure that this works correctly with different test cases.\n\nLet's test it with the example I provided earlier: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]\n\n- tails starts empty.\n\n- num=10: index=0, tails=[10]\n\n- num=9: index=0, tails=[9]\n\n- num=2: index=0, tails=[2]\n\n- num=5: index=1, tails=[2,5]\n\n- num=3: index=1, tails=[2,3]\n\n- num=7: index=2, tails=[2,3,7]\n\n- num=101: index=3, tails=[2,3,7,101]\n\n- num=18: index=3, tails=[2,3,7,18]\n\nLength is 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [3, 10, 2, 1, 20]\n\n- tails starts empty.\n\n- num=3: index=0, tails=[3]\n\n- num=10: index=1, tails=[3,10]\n\n- num=2: index=0, tails=[2,10]\n\n- num=1: index=0, tails=[1,10]\n\n- num=20: index=2, tails=[1,10,20]\n\nLength is 3, which is correct (e.g., [1,10,20] or [3,10,20]).\n\nEdge cases:\n\n- Empty array: return 0\n\n- Single element: return 1\n\n- All elements are the same: return 1\n\n- All elements are strictly increasing: return the length of the array\n\n- All elements are strictly decreasing: return 1\n\nI need to make sure that the function handles these cases correctly.\n\nLet me implement this in TypeScript.\n\nI should also consider the types and possible invalid inputs. Since the function takes an array of integers, I should ensure that the input is indeed an array of integers.\n\nIn TypeScript, I can define the function with type annotations to enforce this.\n\nAdditionally, I can add some comments to explain the logic behind the code.\n\nHere's the final implementation:\n\nfunction lengthOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {\n\nif (nums.length === 0) {\n\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\nlet tails: number[] = [];\n\nfor (let num of nums) {\n\nlet index = binarySearch(tails, num);\n\nif (index === tails.length) {\n\ntails.push(num);\n\n} else {\n\ntails[index] = num;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn tails.length;\n\n}\n\nfunction binarySearch(tails: number[], key: number): number {\n\nlet left = 0;\n\nlet right = tails.length - 1;\n\nwhile (left <= right) {\n\nlet mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);\n\nif (tails[mid] < key) {\n\nleft = mid + 1;\n\n} else {\n\nright = mid - 1;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn left;\n\n}\n\nThis should work correctly and efficiently for finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in O(n log n) time.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array of integers efficiently, with a time complexity of O(n log n). We will use a dynamic programming approach combined with binary search to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - We maintain an array called `tails`, where `tails[i]` represents the smallest tail value of all increasing subsequences with length `i+1`.\n\n2. **Processing each element**:\n   - For each element in the input array, we use binary search to find the position in `tails` where this element can be placed.\n   - If the element is larger than any element in `tails`, it is appended to `tails`.\n   - Otherwise, it replaces the existing value at the found index in `tails`.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - The length of `tails` at the end of the iteration gives the length of the LIS.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the LIS in O(n log n) time due to the use of binary search.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```typescript\nfunction lengthOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {\n    if (nums.length === 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n    let tails: number[] = [];\n    for (let num of nums) {\n        let index = binarySearch(tails, num);\n        if (index === tails.length) {\n            tails.push(num);\n        } else {\n            tails[index] = num;\n        }\n    }\n    return tails.length;\n}\n\nfunction binarySearch(tails: number[], key: number): number {\n    let left = 0;\n    let right = tails.length - 1;\n    while (left <= right) {\n        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);\n        if (tails[mid] < key) {\n            left = mid + 1;\n        } else {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return left;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: Start with an empty array `tails`.\n- **Processing each element**:\n  - Use binary search to find the correct position for the current element in `tails`.\n  - If the element is larger than any in `tails`, append it to `tails`.\n  - Otherwise, replace the existing value at the found index with the current element.\n- **Result**: The length of `tails` gives the length of the LIS.\n\nThis method ensures efficiency and correctness in determining the longest increasing subsequence."
