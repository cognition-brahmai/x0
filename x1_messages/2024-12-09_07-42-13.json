        "content": "Let's see. There are 100 people in the room. 75% of them are wearing glasses. So, first, I need to find out how many people are wearing glasses.\n\n75% of 100 is calculated as:\n\n75/100 * 100 = 75 people\n\nSo, 75 people are wearing glasses.\n\nNow, out of these 75 people wearing glasses, 40% have blue eyes. I need to find out how many that is.\n\n40% of 75 is:\n\n40/100 * 75 = 30 people\n\nSo, 30 people have both glasses and blue eyes.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the percentage of the total population that has both glasses and blue eyes. There are 100 people in total, and 30 of them have both glasses and blue eyes.\n\nTo find the percentage:\n\n(30 / 100) * 100% = 30%\n\nSo, 30% of the total population has both glasses and blue eyes.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to calculate this without finding the actual numbers first?\n\nLet me think.\n\nTotal people: 100\n\nPercentage wearing glasses: 75%\n\nPercentage of glass wearers with blue eyes: 40%\n\nSo, the percentage of the total population with both glasses and blue eyes should be the product of the percentage wearing glasses and the percentage of glass wearers with blue eyes.\n\nBut percentages are out of 100, so:\n\n(75%)(40%) = (75/100)(40/100) = (75*40)/(100*100) = 3000/10000 = 0.30, which is 30%\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, and it confirms the earlier result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or other factors to consider, but the question seems straightforward. It's about finding a subset within a subset.\n\nSo, the final answer is 30%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30\\%} \\]"
