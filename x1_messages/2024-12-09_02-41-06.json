        "content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: If a bee flies at a speed of 15 miles per hour, how far can it fly in 10 minutes? Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that speed is related to distance and time. The formula that connects these three is:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\]\n\nSo, if I have the speed and the time, I can find the distance by rearranging the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nThat makes sense. Now, the speed is given as 15 miles per hour, and the time is 10 minutes. But wait, the units need to match. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in minutes. I need to make sure that both time units are the same.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can convert 10 minutes into hours. Let's do that:\n\n\\[ \\text{time in hours} = \\frac{10 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = \\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, time is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) hours.\n\nNow, plugging the values into the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 15 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nMultiplying these:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\frac{15}{6} \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15}{6} = 2.5 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSo, the bee can fly 2.5 miles in 10 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check. If the bee flies 15 miles in one hour, which is 60 minutes, then in 10 minutes, it should fly a tenth of that distance because 10 minutes is one-sixth of an hour. Yeah, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. If in 60 minutes the bee flies 15 miles, then in 10 minutes it would fly:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\left( \\frac{15 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\right) \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \\text{ miles per minute} \\]\n\nThen multiplying by 10 minutes:\n\n\\[ 0.25 \\text{ miles per minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 2.5 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSame answer again. Good, that reinforces that 2.5 miles is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the unit conversion directly. Since speed is 15 miles per hour, and I need to find the distance for 10 minutes, I can convert the speed to miles per minute.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ miles per hour} = 15 \\text{ miles} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes} = 0.25 \\text{ miles per minute} \\]\n\nThen, for 10 minutes:\n\n\\[ 0.25 \\text{ miles per minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 2.5 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nAgain, the same result. It seems consistent no matter which method I use.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The question is pretty straightforward: a bee flies at a constant speed of 15 miles per hour for 10 minutes. No mention of wind resistance or other factors that might affect speed, so I can assume constant speed.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the units. Make sure that the units are consistent throughout the calculation. I converted minutes to hours to match the speed unit, and that worked out fine.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the speed to miles per minute from the beginning. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 miles per hour is:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.25 \\text{ miles per minute} \\]\n\nThen, multiplying by 10 minutes:\n\n\\[ 0.25 \\text{ miles per minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 2.5 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nOnce more, the same answer. It seems unmistakable now.\n\nLet me try one more approach to be absolutely sure. If the bee flies 15 miles in 60 minutes, then in 10 minutes, it should fly:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 15 \\text{ miles} \\times \\left( \\frac{10 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\right) = 15 \\times \\frac{10}{60} = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 2.5 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nAgain, 2.5 miles.\n\nI think I've confirmed this enough ways. The answer is definitely 2.5 miles.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if the bee's speed changes or if there are any other factors, but based on the problem, it's a straightforward speed and time calculation with no additional variables.\n\nSo, final answer: The bee can fly 2.5 miles in 10 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5} \\]"
