        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here about marbles in a jar, and I need to find the probability that both marbles drawn are red, without replacing the first one before drawing the second. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what's in the jar.\n\nThere are 5 red marbles, 8 blue marbles, and 12 green marbles. So, the total number of marbles is 5 + 8 + 12. Let me calculate that: 5 plus 8 is 13, plus 12 is 25. So, there are 25 marbles in total.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of drawing two red marbles in a row without replacement. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nBut since this is without replacement, the probability changes after the first draw because the total number of marbles decreases by one, and the number of red marbles also decreases by one if the first marble drawn is red.\n\nSo, maybe I should think about this in steps. First, find the probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw, and then find the probability of drawing another red marble on the second draw given that the first one was red. Then, multiply these two probabilities together to get the overall probability.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, the probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw. There are 5 red marbles out of 25 total marbles, so that's 5/25. Simplifying that, it's 1/5.\n\nWait, but I can also think about it in terms of combinations. Since I'm drawing two marbles without replacement, the total number of ways to draw two marbles from 25 is \"25 choose 2.\" And the number of ways to draw two red marbles from the 5 red ones is \"5 choose 2.\" So, the probability should be (\"5 choose 2\") divided by (\"25 choose 2\").\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, \"5 choose 2\" is (5*4)/2 = 10.\n\n\"25 choose 2\" is (25*24)/2 = 300.\n\nSo, the probability is 10/300, which simplifies to 1/30.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But earlier, when I thought about it in steps, I got 1/5 for the first draw and then, if the first was red, there would be 4 red marbles left and 24 marbles in total, so 4/24 = 1/6 for the second draw. Then, multiplying them: 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30. That matches the combination method.\n\nSo, both approaches give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It looks like the probability is 1/30.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I haven't missed anything. Is there any other factor that could affect the probability? For example, the colors of the other marbles or something like that. No, because we're only interested in the red marbles here.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies drawing without replacement, so I don't need to consider the case where the first marble is replaced before drawing the second one.\n\nAlright, I think this makes sense. The probability that both marbles drawn are red is 1/30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{30}} \\]"
