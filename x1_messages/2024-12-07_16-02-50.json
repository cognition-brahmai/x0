        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. There are four houses in a row, and I need to figure out their order based on some clues.\n\nFirst clue: The green house is immediately to the left of the white house. So, green and white are next to each other, with green on the left.\n\nSecond clue: The red house is the first one on the left. So, the leftmost house is red.\n\nThird clue: The blue house is not next to the green house.\n\nAlright, let's start by placing the red house since we know it's first on the left. So, the order starts with red.\n\nHouse 1: Red\n\nNow, the green house is immediately to the left of the white house, but since red is already on the left, green can't be on the far left. So, green must be in house 2 or 3, with white right next to it on its right.\n\nLet me consider if green is in house 2:\n\nHouse 1: Red\n\nHouse 2: Green\n\nHouse 3: White\n\nThen, house 4 would be blue, since blue isn't next to green, but wait, if green is in house 2, and blue is in house 4, blue isn't next to green, which satisfies the third clue.\n\nAlternatively, if green is in house 3:\n\nHouse 1: Red\n\nHouse 2: ?\n\nHouse 3: Green\n\nHouse 4: White\n\nThen, house 2 could be blue, but blue would be next to green, which violates the third clue. So, this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the only possible arrangement is:\n\nHouse 1: Red\n\nHouse 2: Green\n\nHouse 3: White\n\nHouse 4: Blue\n\nLet me double-check to make sure all clues are satisfied.\n\nFirst clue: Green is immediately to the left of white. Yes, green is in house 2, white in house 3.\n\nSecond clue: Red is first on the left. Yes, red is in house 1.\n\nThird clue: Blue is not next to green. Yes, blue is in house 4, and green is in house 2.\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, the order of the houses is red, green, white, blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Red, Green, White, Blue}} \\]"
