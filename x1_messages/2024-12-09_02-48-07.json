        "content": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we've got a bag with 4 red balls and 2 blue balls, making a total of 6 balls. We're drawing two balls without replacement, and we want to find the probability that both balls are red.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once we draw the first ball, we don't put it back into the bag before drawing the second ball. So, the total number of balls decreases by one after the first draw.\n\nNow, to find the probability that both balls are red, we can think of this as two events happening in sequence:\n\n1. Drawing a red ball on the first draw.\n\n2. Drawing another red ball on the second draw, given that the first ball drawn was red.\n\nSince these are dependent events (the outcome of the first draw affects the second draw), we need to multiply the probabilities of each event happening, given the previous event.\n\nLet's start with the first event:\n\n**Probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw:**\n\nThere are 4 red balls out of a total of 6 balls.\n\nSo, P(First red) = Number of red balls / Total number of balls = 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nNow, given that the first ball drawn was red, we need to find the probability that the second ball drawn is also red.\n\n**Probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw, given that the first ball was red:**\n\nSince we didn't replace the first ball, there are now 3 red balls left and a total of 5 balls remaining in the bag.\n\nSo, P(Second red | First red) = Number of remaining red balls / Total remaining balls = 3/5.\n\nNow, to find the overall probability that both balls are red, we multiply these two probabilities:\n\nP(Both red) = P(First red) \u00d7 P(Second red | First red) = (2/3) \u00d7 (3/5).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n(2/3) \u00d7 (3/5) = (2 \u00d7 3) / (3 \u00d7 5) = 6 / 15.\n\nWe can simplify 6/15 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n6 \u00f7 3 = 2\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\nSo, 6/15 simplifies to 2/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 2/5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use combinations. Since we're drawing two balls without replacement, the total number of ways to draw two balls from six is \"6 choose 2,\" which is written as C(6,2).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to draw two red balls from the four red balls is \"4 choose 2,\" or C(4,2).\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are red is:\n\nP(Both red) = C(4,2) / C(6,2).\n\nLet's calculate these combinations.\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2! \u00d7 (4-2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nC(6,2) = 6! / (2! \u00d7 (6-2)!) = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 720 / 48 = 15.\n\nSo, P(Both red) = 6 / 15 = 2/5.\n\nThat matches our earlier calculation. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw two balls from six is 15, as calculated above.\n\nNumber of ways to draw two red balls from four is 6, as calculated above.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 6/15 = 2/5.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to list all possible pairs of balls that can be drawn:\n\nLet's label the balls as R1, R2, R3, R4 (red balls) and B1, B2 (blue balls).\n\nAll possible pairs are:\n\n(R1, R2), (R1, R3), (R1, R4), (R1, B1), (R1, B2),\n\n(R2, R3), (R2, R4), (R2, B1), (R2, B2),\n\n(R3, R4), (R3, B1), (R3, B2),\n\n(R4, B1), (R4, B2),\n\n(B1, B2).\n\nThat's a total of 15 pairs.\n\nNow, the pairs where both balls are red are:\n\n(R1, R2), (R1, R3), (R1, R4), (R2, R3), (R2, R4), (R3, R4).\n\nThat's 6 pairs.\n\nSo, the probability is 6/15 = 2/5.\n\nYet another way is to use the formula for probability of independent events, but in this case, the events are dependent because we're drawing without replacement. So, the first method we used, considering the dependency, is the correct approach.\n\nIt's good to see that all these different methods lead to the same answer, which reinforces our confidence in the result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted or if there are any tricks here.\n\nIs there any chance that the order in which we draw the balls affects the probability? In this problem, the order doesn't matter because we're only interested in whether both balls are red, not in the sequence in which they're drawn.\n\nSo, our calculation stands.\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the problem specifies \"without replacement,\" so we definitely need to account for the changing probabilities after the first draw.\n\nIf it were \"with replacement,\" then the probabilities would be independent, and we could just multiply the probability of drawing a red ball twice.\n\nBut since it's without replacement, our initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
