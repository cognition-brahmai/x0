        "content": "In actuarial science, the method that estimates the future cash flows of a pension fund under different scenarios is known as stochastic modeling. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Stochastic Modeling.\n\nTo provide some context, stochastic modeling is a technique that incorporates randomness and probability distributions to simulate various possible future scenarios. This approach is particularly useful in actuarial science for assessing the financial health and sustainability of pension funds, given the uncertainty associated with future investment returns, mortality rates, and other factors.\n\nOption A, the Binomial Model, is more commonly used in financial mathematics for pricing options and other derivatives, where it models the evolution of asset prices in discrete time steps.\n\nOption B, Monte Carlo Simulation, is a specific type of stochastic modeling that uses repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. It is widely used in finance and actuarial science to model the probability of different outcomes.\n\nOption D, Risk-Neutral Valuation, is a theoretical framework used in financial mathematics to price derivatives by assuming that all investors are risk-neutral. It is not directly related to estimating cash flows for pension funds.\n\nOption E, None of the above, is incorrect because stochastic modeling is indeed the appropriate method for estimating future cash flows under different scenarios in actuarial science.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Stochastic Modeling."
