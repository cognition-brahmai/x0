        "content": "The Aurora Borealis, commonly known as the Northern Lights, is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions around the Arctic and Antarctic. The name \"Aurora Borealis\" is derived from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. This phenomenon occurs due to charged particles, primarily electrons and protons, entering the Earth's atmosphere from the magnetosphere, which is the region of space governed by Earth's magnetic field. These particles are typically energized by the solar wind and interact with atmospheric gases, leading to the emission of light in various colors, most commonly green and pink. The display is usually observed during the night and can be a spectacular sight for those living in or visiting areas near the polar regions."
