        "content": "Let's see here. I have this problem about a train traveling from Town A to Town B. It says the train travels at a constant speed and takes 3 hours to cover 180 miles. Then, it asks if the train were to increase its speed by 20 mph, how long would it take to travel the same distance.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the train's original speed. Since it travels 180 miles in 3 hours at a constant speed, I can use the formula for speed:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nSo, original speed = 180 miles / 3 hours = 60 mph.\n\nNow, if the train increases its speed by 20 mph, the new speed would be:\n\n60 mph + 20 mph = 80 mph.\n\nNext, I need to find out how long it would take to travel the same 180 miles at this new speed. Again, using the speed formula, but rearranged to solve for time:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, time at new speed = 180 miles / 80 mph.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n180 / 80 = 2.25 hours.\n\nBut, it's probably better to express that in hours and minutes. 0.25 hours is 15 minutes (since 0.25 \u00d7 60 minutes = 15 minutes).\n\nTherefore, the train would take 2 hours and 15 minutes to travel from Town A to Town B at the increased speed.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should see if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the concept of inverse proportionality between speed and time when distance is constant. If speed increases, time decreases, and vice versa.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nOriginal speed: S1 = 60 mph\n\nOriginal time: T1 = 3 hours\n\nNew speed: S2 = 80 mph\n\nNew time: T2 = ?\n\nSince distance is constant, S1 * T1 = S2 * T2\n\nSo, T2 = (S1 * T1) / S2 = (60 mph * 3 hours) / 80 mph = 180 / 80 = 2.25 hours, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nAgain, Time = 180 / 80 = 2.25 hours.\n\nAlright, it seems consistent across different methods. I think 2 hours and 15 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the travel time, such as acceleration or stops, but the problem states that the train travels at a constant speed, so no need to account for those.\n\nAlso, it's important to ensure that the units are consistent. In this case, both speed and distance are in miles and hours, so that's fine.\n\nOne more thing to consider: if the train increases its speed by 20 mph, is there any restriction on the maximum speed or anything like that? The problem doesn't mention any constraints, so I'll assume that the speed can be increased by 20 mph without any issues.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if the train increases its speed by 20 mph to 80 mph, it would take 2 hours and 15 minutes to travel the 180 miles from Town A to Town B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours and } 15 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"
