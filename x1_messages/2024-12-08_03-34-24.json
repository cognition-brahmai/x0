        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. I need to find the probability that if I draw two balls at random without replacement, both of them will be the same color. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of ways to draw two balls from the bag. There are total balls in the bag: 5 red + 3 blue + 2 green = 10 balls. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 10 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 45 possible pairs of balls that can be drawn.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to draw two balls of the same color. There are three colors: red, blue, and green.\n\nLet's calculate each one separately.\n\n1. **Red balls:**\n\nThere are 5 red balls. The number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5 is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\n2. **Blue balls:**\n\nThere are 3 blue balls. The number of ways to choose 2 blue balls out of 3 is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2 \\times 1} = 3\n\\]\n\n3. **Green balls:**\n\nThere are 2 green balls. The number of ways to choose 2 green balls out of 2 is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{2}{2} = \\frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to draw two balls of the same color, I add up these amounts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Same color ways} = 10 (\\text{red}) + 3 (\\text{blue}) + 1 (\\text{green}) = 14\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 14 favorable outcomes where both balls are the same color.\n\nFinally, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{14}{45}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to express this fraction? Let's check if 14 and 45 have any common factors. 14 is 2 \u00d7 7, and 45 is 3^2 \u00d7 5. No common factors, so 14/45 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are the same color is 14/45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{45}} \\]"
