        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see: there are 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls in a bag, making a total of 10 balls. I need to pick three balls without looking and find the probability of picking at least one ball of each color.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least one ball of each color\" means. Does that mean exactly one of each, or could it include more than one of some colors as long as all three colors are represented?\n\nWait, no. \"At least one of each color\" would mean that in the three balls I pick, there is at least one red, at least one blue, and at least one green. So, no color is missing from my selection.\n\nBut, since I'm picking three balls, and there are only three colors, this means that each ball must be a different color. Because if I pick two of one color and one of another, I won't have all three colors represented.\n\nWait, no. If I pick two reds and one blue, I have two colors represented: red and blue. But I need all three colors: red, blue, and green.\n\nSo, to have at least one of each color in three balls, I must pick exactly one of each color. Because if I pick more than one of any color, say two reds and one blue, I don't have green. But I need to have at least one of each color.\n\nWait, but if I pick two reds and one blue, I don't have green, so that doesn't satisfy the condition. Similarly, two blues and one red wouldn't include green, and two greens would require picking three greens, but there are only two greens.\n\nWait, but there are only two greens, so I can't pick three greens. So, the only way to have at least one of each color when picking three balls is to pick exactly one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should calculate the total number of ways to pick three balls and the number of favorable outcomes where I have at least one of each color.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick three balls from 10 is C(10,3), where C(n,k) is the combination formula.\n\nC(10,3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = 120.\n\nNow, number of favorable outcomes: picking one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red from five is C(5,1) = 5.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one blue from three is C(3,1) = 3.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one green from two is C(2,1) = 2.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 * 3 * 2 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 30/120 = 1/4.\n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the complement: the probability of not having at least one of each color, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nNot having at least one of each color means that some color is missing in my selection.\n\nSo, I could have all three balls of the same color, or two of one color and one of another.\n\nBut, given that there are only three colors, and I'm picking three balls, having all three of the same color would require that there are at least three balls of that color.\n\nLooking at the bag: 5 red, 3 blue, 2 green.\n\nSo, I could have three reds, or three blues, but not three greens because there are only two greens.\n\nSo, the ways to have all three balls of the same color are:\n\n- Three reds: C(5,3) = 10.\n\n- Three blues: C(3,3) = 1.\n\n- Three greens: Not possible, only two greens.\n\nAlso, I could have two of one color and one of another.\n\nSo, let's calculate that.\n\nTwo reds and one blue: C(5,2) * C(3,1) = 10 * 3 = 30.\n\nTwo reds and one green: C(5,2) * C(2,1) = 10 * 2 = 20.\n\nTwo blues and one red: C(3,2) * C(5,1) = 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nTwo blues and one green: C(3,2) * C(2,1) = 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nTwo greens and one red: C(2,2) * C(5,1) = 1 * 5 = 5.\n\nTwo greens and one blue: C(2,2) * C(3,1) = 1 * 3 = 3.\n\nNow, adding up all these possibilities:\n\nThree reds: 10.\n\nThree blues: 1.\n\nTwo reds and one blue: 30.\n\nTwo reds and one green: 20.\n\nTwo blues and one red: 15.\n\nTwo blues and one green: 6.\n\nTwo greens and one red: 5.\n\nTwo greens and one blue: 3.\n\nTotal: 10 + 1 + 30 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 90.\n\nBut earlier, total possible outcomes are C(10,3) = 120.\n\nSo, probability of not having at least one of each color is 90/120 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, probability of having at least one of each color is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations.\n\nTotal ways to pick three balls: C(10,3) = 120.\n\nFavorable ways: picking one of each color: C(5,1) * C(3,1) * C(2,1) = 5 * 3 * 2 = 30.\n\nSo, probability is 30/120 = 1/4.\n\nAnother way: think about the first ball can be any color, then the second ball must be a different color than the first, and the third ball must be the remaining color.\n\nWait, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst ball: can be any of the 10 balls.\n\nSecond ball: must be a different color than the first ball.\n\nThird ball: must be the remaining color.\n\nBut this seems complicated because the number of choices changes depending on what was picked first.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the first ball is red, then the second ball must be blue or green.\n\n- If the first ball is blue, then the second ball must be red or green.\n\n- If the first ball is green, then the second ball must be red or blue.\n\nAnd then the third ball must be the remaining color.\n\nThis seems messy, and the earlier combination approach seems cleaner.\n\nAlternatively, think about the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, which is 30/120 = 1/4.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/4.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to confirm this?\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nTotal ways to pick three balls: C(10,3) = 120.\n\nFavorable ways: picking one red, one blue, and one green: C(5,1) * C(3,1) * C(2,1) = 5 * 3 * 2 = 30.\n\nTherefore, probability is 30/120 = 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, pick any ball. The first ball can be any color.\n\nThen, the second ball must be a different color than the first.\n\nAnd the third ball must be the remaining color.\n\nBut this approach involves conditional probabilities.\n\nLet's try it.\n\nFirst ball: can be any of the 10 balls.\n\nSecond ball: must be a different color than the first.\n\nIf the first ball is red (probability 5/10), then there are 3 blue + 2 green = 5 balls of different colors left out of 9 remaining balls.\n\nIf the first ball is blue (probability 3/10), then there are 5 red + 2 green = 7 balls of different colors left out of 9 remaining balls.\n\nIf the first ball is green (probability 2/10), then there are 5 red + 3 blue = 8 balls of different colors left out of 9 remaining balls.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is a different color than the first is:\n\n(5/10)*(5/9) + (3/10)*(7/9) + (2/10)*(8/9) = (25 + 21 + 16)/90 = 62/90 = 31/45.\n\nThen, given that the first two balls are different colors, what is the probability that the third ball is the remaining color?\n\nIf the first two balls are red and blue, then the third must be green.\n\nIf the first two are red and green, then the third must be blue.\n\nIf the first two are blue and green, then the third must be red.\n\nSo, in each case, there is only one remaining color to choose from.\n\nGiven that the first two balls are different colors, the number of balls left of the remaining color depends on which colors were picked first.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nI think the combination approach is the easiest here.\n\nTotal ways: C(10,3) = 120.\n\nFavorable ways: C(5,1)*C(3,1)*C(2,1) = 30.\n\nProbability: 30/120 = 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, think about the number of ways to pick one of each color and divide by the total number of ways to pick three balls.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/4.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the complement again.\n\nProbability of not having at least one of each color is the probability of having at least one color missing.\n\nSo, probability of missing red + missing blue + missing green.\n\nBut this would involve inclusion-exclusion because missing red and missing blue, etc., might overlap.\n\nProbability of missing red: number of ways to pick three balls from blue and green: C(3+2,3) = C(5,3) = 10.\n\nProbability of missing blue: number of ways to pick three balls from red and green: C(5+2,3) = C(7,3) = 35.\n\nProbability of missing green: number of ways to pick three balls from red and blue: C(5+3,3) = C(8,3) = 56.\n\nBut, if I just add these up: 10 + 35 + 56 = 101.\n\nBut, this counts some scenarios multiple times. For example, missing both blue and green would be picking all three balls from red, which is C(5,3) = 10, and this is included in both missing blue and missing green.\n\nSimilarly, missing red and blue would be picking all three from green, but there are only two greens, so not possible.\n\nMissing red and green would be picking all three from blue: C(3,3) = 1.\n\nSo, I need to subtract the intersections.\n\nTherefore, by inclusion-exclusion:\n\nProbability of missing at least one color = (missing red) + (missing blue) + (missing green) - (missing red and blue) - (missing red and green) - (missing blue and green) + (missing all three colors).\n\nMissing all three colors is impossible since I'm picking three balls and there are only three colors.\n\nSo, probability of missing at least one color = 10 + 35 + 56 - 10 - 1 - 0 + 0 = 90.\n\nWait, but these are counts, not probabilities. The total number of ways is 120, so probability is 90/120 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, probability of having at least one of each color is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, think about it in terms of permutations.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick three balls in order: 10*9*8 = 720.\n\nNumber of favorable ways: pick one of each color in some order.\n\nNumber of ways to pick one red, one blue, and one green in order: 5*3*2 = 30 for red-blue-green.\n\nBut, the order matters here, so there are 3! = 6 permutations for each set of one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nWait, no. If I already specified red-blue-green, I need to consider all orders.\n\nSo, total favorable permutations: 5 choices for red, 3 for blue, 2 for green, and 3! ways to arrange them.\n\nSo, 5*3*2*6 = 180.\n\nBut total permutations are 10*9*8 = 720.\n\nSo, probability is 180/720 = 1/4.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the probability is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
