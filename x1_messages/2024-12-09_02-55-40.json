        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a store sells three types of candies\u2014A, B, and C\u2014in bags containing 100 pieces each. A customer wants to buy exactly 10 bags, but they must purchase at least one bag of each type. I need to figure out how many different ways they can do this.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. So, there are three types of candies, and the customer is buying bags of these candies. Each bag has 100 pieces, but since the question is about the number of bags and not the number of pieces, the 100 pieces per bag might just be extra information. What matters is the types of bags they're buying.\n\nSo, the customer needs to buy exactly 10 bags, with at least one of each type A, B, and C. That means they have to buy at least one bag of A, at least one of B, and at least one of C.\n\nThis sounds like a problem of distributing indistinguishable objects (the bags) into distinguishable boxes (the types of candies), with some constraints.\n\nIn combinatorics, this is similar to the \"stars and bars\" theorem, where we find the number of ways to distribute n identical items into k distinct groups, with each group getting at least one item.\n\nThe formula for that is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\n\\]\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of groups.\n\nBut wait, in this case, n is 10 bags, and k is 3 types of candies. However, since each type must have at least one bag, we can apply the formula directly.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{9}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(\\binom{9}{2}\\).\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9!}{2!(9 - 2)!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 36 different ways for the customer to buy exactly 10 bags, with at least one of each type.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I've applied the formula correctly.\n\nThe stars and bars theorem for distributing n identical items into k distinct groups with each group getting at least one item is indeed \\(\\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\\).\n\nIn this problem, the bags are identical in the sense that what matters is just the count of each type, not which specific bag is which. The types are distinct (A, B, C).\n\nSo, yes, applying the formula seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as solving the equation:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 10\n\\]\n\nwhere a, b, c are positive integers (since at least one of each).\n\nTo solve this, we can make a substitution: let \\(a' = a - 1\\), \\(b' = b - 1\\), \\(c' = c - 1\\), where a', b', c' are non-negative integers.\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a' + 1) + (b' + 1) + (c' + 1) = 10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\na' + b' + c' = 7\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation.\n\nThis is again a stars and bars problem, but this time allowing zero in any variable.\n\nThe formula for the number of solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{9}{2} = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer: 36 ways.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the total number of ways to buy 10 bags without any restrictions, and then subtract the cases where one or more types are missing.\n\nFirst, find the total number of ways without restrictions.\n\nThis is the number of non-negative integer solutions to:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 10\n\\]\n\nwhich is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{12}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract the cases where at least one type is missing.\n\nThere are three cases: no A, no B, or no C.\n\nFor each case, it's equivalent to solving:\n\n\\[\nb + c = 10\n\\]\n\nwhich has \\(\\binom{10 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{11}{1} = 11\\) solutions.\n\nSince there are three such cases, total to subtract is \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n\nHowever, we've subtracted too much because the cases where two types are missing have been subtracted twice.\n\nBut in this problem, it's impossible to have two types missing because if you exclude two types, you have to buy all 10 bags of the remaining type, which satisfies the condition of buying at least one of each type only if you don't exclude any type.\n\nWait, no. If you exclude two types, you're buying all 10 bags of one type, which violates the \"at least one of each\" condition.\n\nSo, in this case, there are no cases where two types are missing, because that would mean buying zero bags of those types, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, no need to add back any cases.\n\nSo, the number of ways with at least one of each type is:\n\n\\[\n66 - 33 = 33\n\\]\n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier result of 36.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, according to this inclusion-exclusion approach, the answer is 33, but according to the stars and bars approach with constraints, it's 36.\n\nThere must be a mistake in one of these approaches.\n\nLet me check the inclusion-exclusion method more carefully.\n\nTotal ways without restrictions: \\(\\binom{12}{2} = 66\\).\n\nSubtract the cases where at least one type is missing:\n\n- No A: \\(b + c = 10\\), which has 11 solutions.\n\nSimilarly for no B and no C: 11 each.\n\nSo, \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n\nNow, cases where two types are missing:\n\n- No A and no B: must buy all 10 bags of C.\n\n- No A and no C: all 10 bags of B.\n\n- No B and no C: all 10 bags of A.\n\nEach of these has exactly one solution, so total 3 such cases.\n\nHowever, in the inclusion-exclusion principle, when we subtract the cases where at least one type is missing, we have subtracted the cases where two types are missing twice (once for each type missing).\n\nBut in reality, these cases should only be subtracted once.\n\nTherefore, we need to add back these cases.\n\nSo, the correct calculation should be:\n\nTotal ways without restrictions: 66.\n\nSubtract cases where at least one type is missing: -33.\n\nAdd back cases where two types are missing: +3.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways with at least one of each type is:\n\n\\[\n66 - 33 + 3 = 36\n\\]\n\nAh, so the correct answer should be 36, not 33.\n\nI must have forgotten to add back the cases where two types are missing.\n\nThat aligns with the first method using stars and bars with constraints.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of ways is 36.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I list out some small cases to see if the logic holds.\n\nFor example, if the customer buys 1 bag of A, then they need to buy 9 bags of B and C, with at least one of each.\n\nSo, for A=1, B can range from 1 to 8, and C is determined (9 - B).\n\nThat gives 8 possibilities: (A,B,C) = (1,1,8), (1,2,7), ..., (1,8,1).\n\nSimilarly, for A=2, B can range from 1 to 7, C=7 down to 1: 7 possibilities.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\n- A=1: 8 ways\n\n- A=2: 7 ways\n\n- A=3: 6 ways\n\n- A=4: 5 ways\n\n- A=5: 4 ways\n\n- A=6: 3 ways\n\n- A=7: 2 ways\n\n- A=8: 1 way\n\nTotal ways: 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36.\n\nThis matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the number of different ways the customer can buy exactly 10 bags, with at least one of each type, is 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
