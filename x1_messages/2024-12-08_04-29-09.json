        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. There's a box with 10 red balls, 20 blue balls, and 30 green balls. That means the total number of balls is 10 + 20 + 30, which is 60 balls. The question is asking for the probability of picking one ball of each color when I randomly select three balls without replacement.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what it means to pick without replacement. That means once I pick a ball, it's out of the box, and I can't pick it again. So, each pick affects the remaining number of balls.\n\nNow, the total number of ways to pick 3 balls out of 60 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 60 is C(60, 3).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(60, 3) = 60! / (3!(60 - 3)!) = (60 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 58) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = (60 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 58) / 6.\n\nI can calculate that later, but for now, I'll keep it like that.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is picking one ball of each color. So, one red, one blue, and one green.\n\nSince the picks are without replacement, the order in which I pick the balls matters in terms of sequences, but since the problem is just asking for the combination of colors, order doesn't matter in the final count. So, I'll approach this using combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to pick one red ball out of 10 is C(10, 1) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick one blue ball out of 20 is C(20, 1) = 20.\n\nAnd the number of ways to pick one green ball out of 30 is C(30, 1) = 30.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable ways to pick one of each color is 10 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 30.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Actually, yes, because you're choosing one from each group independently.\n\nSo, favorable outcomes = 10 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 30.\n\nNow, the probability is favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is (10 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 30) / C(60, 3).\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using permutations or considering the order of picking.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability step by step, considering that each pick affects the remaining balls.\n\nSo, first pick: the probability of picking any color, but since we need one of each, I need to consider sequences like red, then blue, then green, and all other possible orders.\n\nWait, but since the problem doesn't specify the order, I can consider any order as long as I get one of each color.\n\nSo, perhaps it's easier to stick with the combinations approach.\n\nLet me calculate the numbers.\n\nFirst, C(60, 3) = (60 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 58) / 6.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n60 \u00d7 59 = 3540\n\n3540 \u00d7 58 = 205320\n\n205320 / 6 = 34220.\n\nSo, total number of ways is 34,220.\n\nNow, favorable outcomes = 10 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 30 = 6,000.\n\nTherefore, probability = 6,000 / 34,220.\n\nLet's simplify that fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 20.\n\n6,000 \u00f7 20 = 300\n\n34,220 \u00f7 20 = 1,711\n\nSo, probability = 300 / 1,711.\n\nIs that the final answer?\n\nWait, I should check if this fraction can be simplified further.\n\nLet's see, 300 and 1,711.\n\nDoes 3 divide both? 300 is divisible by 3 (3\u00d7100=300), but 1,711 divided by 3 is 570.333, which is not an integer. So, no.\n\nHow about 5? 300 is divisible by 5, but 1,711 divided by 5 is 342.2, which is not an integer. So, no.\n\nNext, 10? 300 is divisible by 10, but 1,711 divided by 10 is 171.1, not an integer.\n\nSo, 300/1,711 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as a decimal for better understanding.\n\n300 \u00f7 1,711 \u2248 0.1753.\n\nSo, approximately 0.1753, or 17.53%.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects an exact fraction, 300/1,711 is the answer.\n\nWait a second, I should confirm if there's any other way to approach this problem that might give a different or more simplified answer.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the probability step by step, considering the decreasing number of balls with each pick.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nFirst pick: probability of picking any color. Since we need one of each, I can pick any ball first.\n\nLet's say I pick a red ball first. The probability of that is 10/60.\n\nThen, for the second pick, I need to pick a blue ball. Now, there are 59 balls left, including 20 blue balls.\n\nSo, probability of picking a blue ball second is 20/59.\n\nThen, for the third pick, I need to pick a green ball. Now, there are 58 balls left, including 30 green balls.\n\nSo, probability of picking a green ball third is 30/58.\n\nTherefore, the probability for this specific sequence (red, then blue, then green) is (10/60) \u00d7 (20/59) \u00d7 (30/58).\n\nBut, since the order doesn't matter, I need to consider all possible orders: RGB, RBG, BRG, BGR, GBR, GRB.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 possible orders.\n\nSo, total probability is 6 \u00d7 [(10/60) \u00d7 (20/59) \u00d7 (30/58)].\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, (10/60) = 1/6.\n\n(20/59) stays as is.\n\n(30/58) = 15/29.\n\nSo, probability for one sequence is (1/6) \u00d7 (20/59) \u00d7 (15/29) = (1 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 15) / (6 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 29) = 300 / (6 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 29).\n\nNow, 6 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 29.\n\nFirst, 6 \u00d7 59 = 354.\n\n354 \u00d7 29.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n300 \u00d7 29 = 8,700\n\n54 \u00d7 29 = 1,566\n\nTotal = 8,700 + 1,566 = 10,266.\n\nSo, probability for one sequence is 300 / 10,266.\n\nThen, total probability for all sequences is 6 \u00d7 (300 / 10,266) = 1,800 / 10,266.\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 6.\n\n1,800 \u00f7 6 = 300\n\n10,266 \u00f7 6 = 1,711\n\nSo, 300 / 1,711.\n\nWait, that's the same answer I got earlier.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, I end up with 300 / 1,711.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 300/1,711.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{300}{1711}} \\]"
