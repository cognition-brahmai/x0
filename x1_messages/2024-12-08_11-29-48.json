Dinosaurs are part of a different group called sauropsids, which include birds and reptiles. Dimetrodon lived during the Permian period, which was before the time of the dinosaurs, which appeared in the Triassic period.\n\nSo, to clarify, Dimetrodon is not a dinosaur; it's more closely related to mammals and lived before the age of dinosaurs."
