        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a box with red, blue, and green balls. The ratios given are:\n\n- The ratio of red to blue balls is 3:4.\n\n- The ratio of blue to green balls is 2:5.\n\nAnd we're told there are 30 green balls. We need to find the total number of balls in the box.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how these ratios relate to each other. Since we have two separate ratios involving blue balls, maybe I can combine them to find a relationship between red, blue, and green balls all at once.\n\nThe ratio of red to blue is 3:4, which means for every 3 red balls, there are 4 blue balls.\n\nThe ratio of blue to green is 2:5, meaning for every 2 blue balls, there are 5 green balls.\n\nTo combine these, I need to make the number of blue balls in both ratios the same. Right now, in the first ratio, blue is 4, and in the second, it's 2. The least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4. So, I'll adjust the second ratio to have 4 blue balls.\n\nOriginal second ratio: blue to green is 2:5.\n\nTo make blue 4, I'll multiply both parts of the ratio by 2.\n\nSo, blue becomes 2 * 2 = 4, and green becomes 5 * 2 = 10.\n\nNow, the adjusted second ratio is 4:10 (blue to green).\n\nNow, both ratios have the same number of blue balls:\n\n- Red to blue: 3:4\n\n- Blue to green: 4:10\n\nSo, combining these, the ratio of red to blue to green is 3:4:10.\n\nNow, we know there are 30 green balls. In the ratio, green corresponds to 10 parts.\n\nSo, if 10 parts = 30 balls, then 1 part = 30 / 10 = 3 balls.\n\nNow, we can find the number of red and blue balls:\n\n- Red balls: 3 parts = 3 * 3 = 9 balls\n\n- Blue balls: 4 parts = 4 * 3 = 12 balls\n\n- Green balls: 10 parts = 10 * 3 = 30 balls\n\nNow, to find the total number of balls, we add them up:\n\nTotal balls = red + blue + green = 9 + 12 + 30 = 51 balls.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the ratio is 3:4:10, and each part is 3 balls, then:\n\n- Red: 3 * 3 = 9\n\n- Blue: 4 * 3 = 12\n\n- Green: 10 * 3 = 30\n\nTotal: 9 + 12 + 30 = 51.\n\nBut, let me confirm if the ratio is correctly combined.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of proportions.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Red:Blue = 3:4\n\n- Blue:Green = 2:5\n\nFirst, express both ratios in terms of blue.\n\nRed:Blue = 3:4\n\nBlue:Green = 2:5\n\nTo combine, I need a common term for blue. Let's find a common multiple for the blue parts in both ratios.\n\nIn Red:Blue, blue is 4 parts.\n\nIn Blue:Green, blue is 2 parts.\n\nThe least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4.\n\nSo, adjust the Blue:Green ratio to have blue as 4 parts.\n\nOriginal Blue:Green = 2:5\n\nMultiply both parts by 2 to make blue 4: 2*2 : 5*2 = 4:10\n\nNow, Red:Blue:Green = 3:4:10\n\nSo, yes, the combined ratio is 3:4:10.\n\nGiven that green has 30 balls, which corresponds to 10 parts.\n\nSo, 10 parts = 30 balls \u2192 1 part = 3 balls.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Red balls: 3 parts \u2192 3 * 3 = 9\n\n- Blue balls: 4 parts \u2192 4 * 3 = 12\n\n- Green balls: 10 parts \u2192 10 * 3 = 30\n\nTotal balls: 9 + 12 + 30 = 51.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to find the total ratio parts first.\n\nTotal parts = 3 + 4 + 10 = 17 parts.\n\nIf 10 parts correspond to 30 green balls, then the total number of balls is (17 parts / 10 parts) * 30 = 1.7 * 30 = 51 balls.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit messy. Let me calculate it properly.\n\nFirst, find the value of one part.\n\nSince 10 parts = 30 balls, then 1 part = 30 / 10 = 3 balls.\n\nThen, total parts are 17, so total balls = 17 * 3 = 51.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, using proportions:\n\nGiven that green balls are 30, and green corresponds to 10 parts out of total 17 parts.\n\nSo, the total number of balls can be found by:\n\nTotal balls = (total parts / green parts) * number of green balls = (17 / 10) * 30 = 17 * 3 = 51.\n\nAgain, 51 balls.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Number of red balls as R,\n\n- Number of blue balls as B,\n\n- Number of green balls as G.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. R/B = 3/4 \u21d2 R = (3/4)B\n\n2. B/G = 2/5 \u21d2 B = (2/5)G\n\nAnd G = 30.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nB = (2/5)*30 = 12 balls.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nR = (3/4)*12 = 9 balls.\n\nTotal balls = R + B + G = 9 + 12 + 30 = 51.\n\nAgain, 51 balls.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratios:\n\nRed:Blue:Green = 3:4:10\n\nTotal parts = 3 + 4 + 10 = 17 parts.\n\nGiven G = 30, which is 10 parts.\n\nSo, the multiplier is 30 / 10 = 3.\n\nTherefore, total balls = 17 parts * 3 = 51.\n\nConsistently getting 51 balls as the total.\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls in the box is 51.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{51} \\]"
