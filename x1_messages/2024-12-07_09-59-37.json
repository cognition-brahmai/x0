        "content": "Let's solve the equation 3x - 7 = 11 step by step. So, we have:\n\n3x - 7 = 11\n\nFirst, we want to isolate the term with the variable x. To do that, we can start by getting rid of the -7 on the left side. We can add 7 to both sides of the equation to keep it balanced. So, adding 7 to both sides:\n\n3x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x = 18\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. Since x is being multiplied by 3, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x:\n\n3x / 3 = 18 / 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, the solution is x = 6.\n\nTo make sure this is correct, we can plug x = 6 back into the original equation and see if it holds true:\n\n3(6) - 7 = 18 - 7 = 11\n\nYes, it matches the right side of the equation. So, x = 6 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
