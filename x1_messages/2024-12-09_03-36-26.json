        "content": "So I need to find the integral of the function g(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1 with respect to x. Okay, integral means I'm looking for the antiderivative of this function. So, I need to find a function whose derivative is g(x).\n\nFirst, I recall that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. So, I can break this down into integrating each term separately.\n\nSo, \u222bg(x) dx = \u222b(x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1) dx = \u222bx^3 dx - 4\u222bx^2 dx + 6\u222bx dx - \u222b1 dx.\n\nNow, I need to integrate each term one by one.\n\nStarting with \u222bx^3 dx. I know that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), where n is not equal to -1. In this case, n=3, so \u222bx^3 dx = (x^(3+1))/(3+1) = x^4/4.\n\nNext, -4\u222bx^2 dx. Again, using the power rule, \u222bx^2 dx = x^3/3. So, -4 times that is -4(x^3/3) = -4x^3/3.\n\nThen, 6\u222bx dx. The integral of x is x^2/2, so 6 times that is 6(x^2/2) = 3x^2.\n\nFinally, -\u222b1 dx. The integral of a constant is the constant times x, so \u222b1 dx = x. Therefore, -\u222b1 dx = -x.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n\u222bg(x) dx = x^4/4 - 4x^3/3 + 3x^2 - x + C,\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. We always include C when finding indefinite integrals because the derivative of a constant is zero, so multiple functions differing by a constant can have the same derivative.\n\nLet me just double-check each term to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst term: x^3 integrates to x^4/4. That seems correct.\n\nSecond term: -4x^2 integrates to -4x^3/3. Yeah, that's right.\n\nThird term: 6x integrates to 3x^2. Correct.\n\nFourth term: -1 integrates to -x. That's fine.\n\nAnd don't forget the constant C.\n\nSo, the final answer is \u222bg(x) dx = (x^4)/4 - (4x^3)/3 + 3x^2 - x + C.\n\nI can also write it as (1/4)x^4 - (4/3)x^3 + 3x^2 - x + C, which might look a bit cleaner.\n\nAlternatively, I could factor out an x or something, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll leave it in this expanded form.\n\nOkay, I think that's it. Integration is basically the reverse of differentiation, so if I were to take the derivative of this result, I should get back to g(x).\n\nLet me quickly verify that.\n\nTake the derivative of (1/4)x^4 - (4/3)x^3 + 3x^2 - x + C.\n\nThe derivative of (1/4)x^4 is (1/4)*4x^3 = x^3.\n\nThe derivative of -(4/3)x^3 is -(4/3)*3x^2 = -4x^2.\n\nThe derivative of 3x^2 is 6x.\n\nThe derivative of -x is -1.\n\nThe derivative of C is 0.\n\nSo, altogether, x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1, which is exactly g(x). Great, that matches.\n\nSo, I'm confident that my integral is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any special techniques or substitutions needed here, but since g(x) is a polynomial, and polynomials can be integrated term by term using the power rule, I don't think any substitution is necessary.\n\nMoreover, all the exponents are positive integers, so no issues there.\n\nIf there were negative or fractional exponents, I'd need to handle them carefully, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered everything. The integral of g(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 1 with respect to x is (1/4)x^4 - (4/3)x^3 + 3x^2 - x + C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}x^{4} - \\dfrac{4}{3}x^{3} + 3x^{2} - x + C} \\]"
