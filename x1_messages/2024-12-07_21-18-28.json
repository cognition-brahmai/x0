        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have John and Tom, and John has twice as many apples as Tom. Together, they have 18 apples. I need to figure out how many apples each one has.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"twice as many\" means. If Tom has a certain number of apples, say x, then John has twice that, which would be 2x. So, Tom has x apples, and John has 2x apples.\n\nNow, together they have 18 apples. That means if I add Tom's apples and John's apples together, it should equal 18. So, x + 2x = 18.\n\nCombining like terms, x + 2x is 3x, so 3x = 18.\n\nTo find x, I need to divide both sides by 3. So, x = 18 / 3, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, Tom has 6 apples, and John has twice that, which is 12 apples.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If Tom has 6 and John has 12, together that's 6 + 12 = 18, which matches the total given. Also, John does have twice as many as Tom, since 12 is twice 6. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I should consider the ratio of their apples. If John has twice as many as Tom, the ratio of John's apples to Tom's apples is 2:1.\n\nSo, for every 2 apples John has, Tom has 1. Together, that's 3 parts. If 3 parts equal 18 apples, then each part is 18 / 3 = 6 apples.\n\nSo, Tom has 1 part, which is 6 apples, and John has 2 parts, which is 12 apples. That matches what I found earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the difference in the number of apples they have. Since John has twice as many as Tom, the difference between John's and Tom's apples is equal to Tom's amount.\n\nSo, if John has 2x and Tom has x, then John has 2x - x = x more apples than Tom.\n\nBut I don't have information about the difference in the number of apples, only the total. So, this approach might not be as straightforward.\n\nStick with the first two methods I used, which both lead to the same conclusion: Tom has 6 apples, and John has 12.\n\nI could also verify this by subtracting. If John has 12 apples and Tom has 6, and John has twice as many as Tom, it holds true. Also, 12 + 6 = 18, which matches the total given.\n\nI don't see any inconsistencies or alternative interpretations that would change this outcome. So, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Tom has } 6 \\text{ apples and John has } 12 \\text{ apples.}} \\]"
