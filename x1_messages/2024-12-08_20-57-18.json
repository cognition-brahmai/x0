        "content": "So there's a class with 20 students in total, and out of those, 12 are boys. I need to find out what fraction of the class are girls. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of students is 20, and among them, 12 are boys. So, to find out how many girls there are, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. That is:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys\nNumber of girls = 20 - 12\nNumber of girls = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 girls in the class.\n\nNow, I need to find out what fraction of the class these 8 girls represent. The class has 20 students in total, so the fraction of girls would be the number of girls divided by the total number of students. That is:\n\nFraction of girls = Number of girls / Total students\nFraction of girls = 8 / 20\n\nNow, I can simplify this fraction. Both 8 and 20 are divisible by 4.\n\n8 \u00f7 4 = 2\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 2/5.\n\nTherefore, 2/5 of the class are girls.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If there are 12 boys and 8 girls, that adds up to 20 students, which is correct. And 8 girls out of 20 students is indeed 8/20, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of percentages to verify. 2/5 is equal to 0.4, which is 40%. So, 40% of the class are girls. Let me check with the original numbers: 8 girls out of 20 students is indeed 40%.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see that boys are 12 out of 20, which is 12/20 = 3/5, which is 60%. And 100% - 60% = 40%, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, everything checks out. The fraction of the class that are girls is 2/5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}} \\]"
