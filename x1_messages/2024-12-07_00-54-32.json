        "content": "So, the train is moving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours to go between two cities. We need to find out how far apart these cities are.\n\nWell, I remember that when something moves at a constant speed, the distance it covers is equal to its speed multiplied by the time it's been moving. So, distance equals speed times time, right? That's a basic formula in physics.\n\nSo, if the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 2 hours, then the distance should be 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure about the units. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so when you multiply them, the hours cancel out, and you're left with miles, which is the unit for distance. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it, in one hour, the train covers 60 miles. So in two hours, it should cover twice that distance, which is 120 miles.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for speed: speed equals distance divided by time. If we rearrange that formula to solve for distance, we get distance equals speed times time. Again, that's the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The cities are 120 miles apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
