        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that. So, you want a recursive function in Python to calculate the factorial of a given number. Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!.\n\nFor example:\n\n5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n\nRecursive functions are functions that call themselves until they reach a base case. For factorial, the base case is when n is 0 or 1, because 0! = 1 and 1! = 1.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\nLet me explain this code:\n\n1. The function `factorial` takes an integer `n` as input.\n\n2. It checks if `n` is 0 or 1. If it is, it returns 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n\n3. If `n` is greater than 1, it returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`. This is the recursive step where the function calls itself with a smaller value of `n`.\n\n4. This process continues until `n` becomes 1, and then the function starts returning the accumulated product.\n\nYou can test this function with different values. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\nprint(factorial(0))  # Output: 1\nprint(factorial(1))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nJust make sure that you don't call this function with a negative number, as factorials for negative numbers are undefined. You might want to add some error checking for negative inputs:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\nThis way, if someone passes a negative number, the function will raise an error.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
