        "content": "I've heard that legend before, but I'm not sure if it's true. The story goes that in the 15th century, King Alfonso V of Aragon had a lisp, and because he was the king and an influential figure, his speech habits spread throughout the court and eventually to the general population. This supposedly led to the pronunciation of \"c\" and \"z\" as \"th\" sounds in certain regions of Spain, particularly in Andalusia.\n\nHowever, linguistic experts generally don't support this theory. The change in pronunciation is more likely due to natural linguistic evolution and the influence of other languages and dialects. The \"s\" sound in Latin evolved into different pronunciations in various Romance languages, and the \"th\" sound in Spanish coronal fricatives could be a result of that evolution.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the lisping king theory is similar to other urban legends about linguistic changes being attributed to influential figures with speech impediments. For example, there's a myth that the French pronunciation of \"r\" as a guttural sound originated from Henri IV, who had a speech impediment. Again, linguists dismiss this as unfounded.\n\nSo while the story of the lisping king makes for an interesting tale, it's probably not the actual reason for the Spanish pronunciation of coronal fricatives. The truth is likely more complex and rooted in the natural development of language over time."
