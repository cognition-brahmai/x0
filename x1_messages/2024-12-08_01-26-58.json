Here's my attempt:\n\nRhythm flows through\nSilent night, stars above\nWhispers in breeze\n\nIn this haiku, the words \"Rhythm,\" \"night,\" and \"breeze\" contain only consonants, though it's worth noting that \"night\" and \"breeze\" do contain vowels. It's tricky to find words without any vowels, but these words mostly consist of consonants."
