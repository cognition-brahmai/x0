        "content": "So the farmer has a rectangular field that's 300 meters long and 200 meters wide, and he wants to plant corn in rows that are spaced 0.5 meters apart. The question is, how many rows of corn can he plant?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. We have a field with specific dimensions, and we're supposed to figure out how many rows of corn can be planted with a given row spacing.\n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine the field is a rectangle, and the farmer is going to plant rows of corn across it. The rows are spaced 0.5 meters apart. So, the distance between one row and the next is 0.5 meters.\n\nNow, I need to determine how many such rows can fit into the field. But I'm a bit confused about which dimension to consider for the rows. Is the farmer planting the rows along the length or the width of the field?\n\nHmm. The problem says the field is 300 meters long and 200 meters wide. Typically, when we talk about the length and width of a rectangle, length is the longer side, and width is the shorter one. So, in this case, 300 meters is the length, and 200 meters is the width.\n\nNow, if the farmer is planting rows across the width, that is, across the 200-meter side, then the number of rows would be determined by the length of the field, which is 300 meters.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if he's planting rows across the width, then the rows would be parallel to the width, which is 200 meters, and the spacing between rows would be along the length, which is 300 meters.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the direction of the rows doesn't matter for the number of rows, as long as the spacing is 0.5 meters between rows.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the rows are spaced 0.5 meters apart, regardless of the field's dimensions, and see how many such spaces fit into the field.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. The number of rows should depend on the dimension perpendicular to the rows.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the rows are planted parallel to one of the sides, and the spacing is perpendicular to the rows.\n\nThis is getting messy. Maybe I should look for a formula or a general approach to this kind of problem.\n\nI recall that when planting rows with a certain spacing, the number of rows is determined by the area divided by the row spacing, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the length divided by the row spacing if the rows are planted along the width, or the width divided by the row spacing if the rows are planted along the length.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLet's assume the rows are planted parallel to the width, which is 200 meters. That means the rows are 200 meters long, and the spacing between rows is 0.5 meters along the length of the field, which is 300 meters.\n\nSo, along the 300-meter length, how many 0.5-meter spaces can be fit?\n\nWell, the number of spaces would be the length divided by the spacing: 300 meters / 0.5 meters = 600 spaces.\n\nBut, the number of rows would be one more than the number of spaces, because the first row starts at one end, and then there are 600 spaces between rows.\n\nSo, the total number of rows would be 600 + 1 = 601 rows.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think about a smaller scale.\n\nSuppose the length is 1 meter, and the row spacing is 0.5 meters.\n\nSo, at 0 meters, the first row is planted.\n\nThen at 0.5 meters, the next row.\n\nAnd at 1 meter, another row.\n\nSo, total rows are 3, and the number of spaces between rows is 2 (from 0 to 0.5 and from 0.5 to 1).\n\nSo, number of rows = number of spaces + 1.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, number of rows = (300 / 0.5) + 1 = 600 + 1 = 601.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if this makes sense in the context of planting corn.\n\nMaybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps the rows are planted across the width, so each row is 200 meters long, and the spacing between rows is 0.5 meters along the 300-meter length.\n\nIn that case, the number of rows would be the length divided by the row spacing.\n\nSo, 300 meters / 0.5 meters = 600 rows.\n\nBut according to my earlier logic, it should be 601 rows.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me check with a smaller example again.\n\nSuppose the length is 1 meter, and row spacing is 0.5 meters.\n\nIf I divide 1 / 0.5, I get 2. But earlier I thought it's 3 rows for 1 meter length.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider whether the first row is at the start or not.\n\nIf the first row is at 0 meters, then the next at 0.5 meters, then at 1 meter, that's 3 rows for 1 meter length.\n\nSo, in general, number of rows = (length / spacing) + 1.\n\nTherefore, for 300 meters length and 0.5 meters spacing, number of rows = (300 / 0.5) + 1 = 600 + 1 = 601.\n\nBut, perhaps in farming practice, it's different.\n\nMaybe the rows are planted starting from one end and then spaced evenly across the length.\n\nIn that case, the number of rows would be the integer part of the length divided by the spacing.\n\nBut in this case, 300 / 0.5 is exactly 600, so 600 rows.\n\nBut according to my small-scale example, it should be 601 rows.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think about the spacing.\n\nIf the rows are spaced 0.5 meters apart, that means from the beginning of the field to the first row is 0 meters, then the next row is at 0.5 meters, then at 1 meter, and so on, up to 300 meters.\n\nSo, the positions of the rows are at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., up to 300 meters.\n\nSo, the number of rows is the number of positions from 0 to 300 meters at intervals of 0.5 meters.\n\nSo, number of rows = (300 / 0.5) + 1 = 600 + 1 = 601.\n\nAlternatively, it can be thought of as the number of times the spacing fits into the length, plus one for the initial row.\n\nSo, 601 rows.\n\nBut, perhaps in practical farming, it's different.\n\nMaybe the rows start at the beginning and end at the end, with equal spacing in between.\n\nIn that case, the distance between the first and last row is (number of rows - 1) * spacing.\n\nSo, if number of rows = n, then (n - 1) * 0.5 = 300.\n\nTherefore, n - 1 = 300 / 0.5 = 600, so n = 601.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the farmer can plant 601 rows of corn.\n\nBut, perhaps I should consider the width of the rows as well.\n\nWait, no, the problem states that the rows are spaced 0.5 meters apart, but doesn't specify the width of each row.\n\nAssuming the rows are planted in single file, meaning each row is just a line of corn plants, then the width of each row is negligible, and the spacing is just between the rows.\n\nTherefore, the number of rows is determined solely by the length of the field and the spacing between rows.\n\nHence, the answer is 601 rows.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if the rows are planted along the width instead.\n\nIf the rows are planted along the 200-meter width, then the number of rows would be the length divided by the spacing: 300 / 0.5 = 600, plus one for the initial row, totaling 601 rows.\n\nSo, regardless of the direction, the calculation remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the farmer can plant 601 rows of corn.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{601} \\]"
