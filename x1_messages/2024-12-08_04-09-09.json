        "content": "To find the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 flips of a fair coin, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is given by:\n\n\\[ P(k) = C(n,k) \\times p^k \\times q^{n-k} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( C(n,k) \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time.\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (in this case, 10 coin flips).\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful trials (in this case, 6 heads).\n\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success in a single trial (for a fair coin, the probability of heads is 0.5).\n\n- \\( q \\) is the probability of failure in a single trial (for a fair coin, the probability of tails is also 0.5).\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\( C(10,6) \\), which is the number of ways to choose 6 heads out of 10 flips. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n,k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ C(10,6) = \\frac{10!}{6! \\times 4!} \\]\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n- \\( 10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3,628,800 \\)\n\n- \\( 6! = 720 \\)\n\n- \\( 4! = 24 \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ C(10,6) = \\frac{3,628,800}{720 \\times 24} = \\frac{3,628,800}{17,280} = 210 \\]\n\nNext, since the coin is fair, \\( p = 0.5 \\) and \\( q = 0.5 \\).\n\nNow, plugging into the binomial formula:\n\n\\[ P(6) = C(10,6) \\times (0.5)^6 \\times (0.5)^{10-6} = 210 \\times (0.5)^6 \\times (0.5)^4 \\]\n\nSince \\( (0.5)^6 \\times (0.5)^4 = (0.5)^{10} \\),\n\n\\[ P(6) = 210 \\times (0.5)^{10} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (0.5)^{10} \\):\n\n\\[ (0.5)^{10} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ P(6) = 210 \\times \\frac{1}{1024} = \\frac{210}{1024} \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{210}{1024} = \\frac{105}{512} \\]\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 flips of a fair coin is \\( \\frac{105}{512} \\), which is approximately 0.205078125, or about 20.51%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{105}{512}} \\]"
