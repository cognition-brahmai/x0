        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the area of the entire field since the farmer wants to plant corn and wheat each on half of it.\n\nThe field is rectangular, measuring 300 meters long and 200 meters wide. To find the area, I multiply the length by the width:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 300 \\, \\text{m} \\times 200 \\, \\text{m} = 60,000 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the total area of the field is 60,000 square meters.\n\nNext, the farmer wants to plant corn and wheat each on half of the field. Therefore, I need to calculate the area for each crop:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area for corn} = \\frac{60,000 \\, \\text{m}^2}{2} = 30,000 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area for wheat} = \\frac{60,000 \\, \\text{m}^2}{2} = 30,000 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to determine how many kilograms of seeds are required for each crop.\n\nStarting with corn, which requires 2 kilograms of seeds per square meter. So, for 30,000 square meters:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Seeds for corn} = 30,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 = 60,000 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nNext, wheat requires 3 kilograms of seeds per square meter. Therefore, for 30,000 square meters:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Seeds for wheat} = 30,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 3 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 = 90,000 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nSo, the farmer will need 60,000 kilograms of corn seeds and 90,000 kilograms of wheat seeds.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like an enormous amount of seeds. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the area calculation:\n\n\\[\n300 \\, \\text{m} \\times 200 \\, \\text{m} = 60,000 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, dividing the field into two equal parts:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60,000 \\, \\text{m}^2}{2} = 30,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\, \\text{each}\n\\]\n\nAlright, that holds up.\n\nNow, for corn:\n\n\\[\n30,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 = 60,000 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nAnd for wheat:\n\n\\[\n30,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 3 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 = 90,000 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nYes, those calculations seem accurate.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total seeds required for the entire field and then divide it according to the crop distribution.\n\nFirst, find the total seeds required if the entire field was planted with corn:\n\n\\[\n60,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 = 120,000 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nAnd if the entire field was planted with wheat:\n\n\\[\n60,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 3 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 = 180,000 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nBut since half is corn and half is wheat, I can average these or find the total seeds required and then split them.\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach. Let me stick with the initial method, as it directly calculates the seeds needed for each half.\n\nAnother way is to consider the seeds per square meter for both crops and find the average, then multiply by the total area.\n\nLet's see:\n\nSeeds per square meter for corn: 2 kg\n\nSeeds per square meter for wheat: 3 kg\n\nSince each crop covers half the field, the average seeds per square meter would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average seeds per m}^2 = \\frac{2 \\, \\text{kg} + 3 \\, \\text{kg}}{2} = 2.5 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2\n\\]\n\nThen, total seeds for the entire field:\n\n\\[\n60,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 = 150,000 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nBut this total includes both corn and wheat seeds combined. Since I already calculated 60,000 kg for corn and 90,000 kg for wheat, which sum up to 150,000 kg, this confirms my earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs 60,000 kg of corn seeds and 90,000 kg of wheat seeds.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit skeptical about the seed rates given. In reality, seeds are usually measured in kilograms per hectare, and 1 hectare equals 10,000 square meters.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe field is 60,000 m\u00b2, which is 6 hectares.\n\nSeed rate for corn: 2 kg/m\u00b2 \u00d7 60,000 m\u00b2 = 120,000 kg, or 20 kg per hectare.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 2 kg/m\u00b2 is extremely high.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the units.\n\nLet me check the seed rates again.\n\nIn reality, corn seeds are typically planted at a rate of around 25 to 40 kg per hectare, depending on the spacing and variety.\n\nSimilarly, wheat is usually around 120 to 150 kg per hectare.\n\nGiven that, the provided seed rates in the problem seem unrealistic.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the units.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n\"corn requires 2 kilograms of seeds per square meter\"\n\n\" wheat requires 3 kilograms of seeds per square meter\"\n\nBut in reality, planting 2 kg of corn seeds per square meter is not feasible, as that would be an enormous amount.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the problem, or perhaps the units are not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the seed rates are given in kilograms per are (1 are = 100 m\u00b2), which was sometimes used in older agricultural texts.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf the seed rates are in kg per are, then:\n\n1 are = 100 m\u00b2\n\nSo, 2 kg per are for corn and 3 kg per are for wheat.\n\nThen, for 60,000 m\u00b2, which is 600 are (since 60,000 m\u00b2 / 100 m\u00b2 per are = 600 are):\n\nSeeds for corn:\n\n\\[\n2 \\, \\text{kg/are} \\times 600 \\, \\text{are} = 1,200 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nSeeds for wheat:\n\n\\[\n3 \\, \\text{kg/are} \\times 600 \\, \\text{are} = 1,800 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nThat seems more realistic.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"per square meter,\" not per are.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and it should be \"per are\" instead of \"per square meter.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's meant to be \"per are\" but written incorrectly.\n\nGiven the unrealistic seed rates per square meter, it's likely a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, assuming it's indeed per square meter, then the calculations stand: 60,000 kg of corn seeds and 90,000 kg of wheat seeds.\n\nBut realistically, that's not feasible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem intended to say \"per are,\" and there was a typo.\n\nIn that case, the realistic amounts would be 1,200 kg of corn seeds and 1,800 kg of wheat seeds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the seed rates are in grams per square meter.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n2 kg/m\u00b2 would be 2,000 grams/m\u00b2, which is still extremely high.\n\nWait, no, 2 kg/m\u00b2 is already in kilograms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's meant to be 2 grams per square meter for corn and 3 grams per square meter for wheat.\n\nThat would make more sense.\n\nLet's assume that's the case.\n\nSo, corn: 2 g/m\u00b2\n\nWheat: 3 g/m\u00b2\n\nThen, for 30,000 m\u00b2 each:\n\nSeeds for corn:\n\n\\[\n30,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{g/m}^2 = 60,000 \\, \\text{g} = 60 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nSeeds for wheat:\n\n\\[\n30,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 3 \\, \\text{g/m}^2 = 90,000 \\, \\text{g} = 90 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nThat seems much more reasonable.\n\nGiven the unrealistic seed rates when assuming kilograms per square meter, it's likely that the problem intended to use grams per square meter.\n\nTherefore, the farmer would need 60 kg of corn seeds and 90 kg of wheat seeds.\n\nAlternatively, if the rates are indeed in kilograms per square meter, then the amounts would be 60,000 kg and 90,000 kg, respectively.\n\nBut considering real-world seed rates, the former seems more plausible.\n\nHence, assuming the seed rates are 2 g/m\u00b2 for corn and 3 g/m\u00b2 for wheat, the farmer needs 60 kg of corn seeds and 90 kg of wheat seeds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60 \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{of corn seeds and} \\, 90 \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{of wheat seeds}} \\]"
