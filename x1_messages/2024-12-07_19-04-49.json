        "content": "Let's break this down. The car rental company charges $25 per day and 15 cents per mile. I need to find out the total cost for renting the car for 5 days and driving it for 200 miles.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the cost of renting the car for 5 days. Since it's $25 per day, I'll multiply 25 by 5.\n\n25 * 5 = 125\n\nSo, the rental cost for 5 days is $125.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the cost for driving 200 miles. The charge is 15 cents per mile. I need to multiply 0.15 (which is 15 cents in dollars) by 200.\n\n0.15 * 200 = 30\n\nSo, the mileage cost is $30.\n\nNow, I'll add the rental cost and the mileage cost to get the total cost.\n\n125 + 30 = 155\n\nTherefore, the total cost to rent the car for 5 days and drive it for 200 miles is $155.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{155} \\]"
