        "content": "The board game you're referring to is likely \"Chaturanga.\" Chaturanga was an ancient Indian strategy game that originated around the 6th century AD. It is considered one of the earliest predecessors to modern chess. The game was played on an 8x8 uncheckered board and involved four players, each controlling a different set of pieces representing infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots. Over time, Chaturanga evolved into Shatranj in Persia, which then spread to Europe and eventually developed into the chess we know today."
