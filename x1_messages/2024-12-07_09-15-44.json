        "content": "Venus has the longest day in our solar system, taking approximately 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. This is because Venus rotates very slowly on its axis compared to other planets. In fact, Venus rotates so slowly that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus! This means that a single day on Venus lasts longer than the time it takes for Venus to orbit around the Sun once. This unique characteristic makes Venus an interesting subject of study for astronomers and planetary scientists."
