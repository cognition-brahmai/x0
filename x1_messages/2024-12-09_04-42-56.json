        "content": "Alright, I need to write a Python program that implements the Quick Sort algorithm. Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, which means it breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems until they become simple enough to solve directly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how Quick Sort works. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot element**: This can be any element from the array, but commonly it's the last element.\n\n2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this step, the pivot is in its final position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays formed by partitioning**: One sub-array consists of elements before the pivot, and the other consists of elements after the pivot.\n\nI need to make sure that the program handles various cases, such as an already sorted array, an array with all elements identical, and an array with duplicate elements.\n\nLet me start by writing a function that performs the partitioning. I'll need to select a pivot and then rearrange the elements accordingly.\n\nHere's a plan for the partition function:\n\n- Select the last element as the pivot.\n\n- Initialize a variable to keep track of the index of the smaller element.\n\n- Iterate through the array from the start to the second last element.\n\n- If the current element is smaller than or equal to the pivot, swap it with the element at the smaller index position and increment the smaller index.\n\n- After iterating through the array, swap the pivot element with the element at the smaller index position.\n\n- Return the index of the pivot.\n\nNext, I'll write the quick_sort function that recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n\nI should also consider the base case for the recursion, which is when the array has one or zero elements.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code:\n\n- Define the quick_sort function that takes the array, start index, and end index as arguments.\n\n- In the quick_sort function, if start index is less than end index:\n\n- Call the partition function to get the pivot index.\n\n- Recursively call quick_sort for the sub-array before the pivot.\n\n- Recursively call quick_sort for the sub-array after the pivot.\n\n- Define the partition function that takes the array, start index, and end index.\n\n- Select the pivot as the last element.\n\n- Track the index of the smaller element.\n\n- Iterate from start to end - 1.\n\n- If the current element is smaller than or equal to the pivot, swap it with the element at the smaller index and increment the smaller index.\n\n- Swap the pivot with the element at the smaller index.\n\n- Return the smaller index.\n\nFinally, I need to handle the input and output:\n\n- Take a list of integers as input from the user.\n\n- Call the quick_sort function with the list, starting index 0, and ending index len(list) - 1.\n\n- Print the sorted list.\n\nI should also consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: Should return an empty list.\n\n- Single element list: Should return the same list.\n\n- All elements identical: Should return the same list.\n\n- Already sorted list: Should still sort it, though it's already sorted.\n\n- Reverse sorted list: Should sort it in ascending order.\n\nI need to make sure that the program doesn't have any infinite recursions or index errors.\n\nLet me sketch a rough code structure:\n\n```\n\ndef quick_sort(arr, low, high):\n\n    if low < high:\n\n        pi = partition(arr, low, high)\n\n        quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)\n\n        quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)\n\ndef partition(arr, low, high):\n\n    pivot = arr[high]\n\n    i = low - 1\n\n    for j in range(low, high):\n\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n\n            i += 1\n\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\n    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]\n\n    return i + 1\n\n# Take input from user\n\narr = list(map(int, input(\"Enter the list of integers: \").split()))\n\nn = len(arr)\n\nquick_sort(arr, 0, n - 1)\n\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", arr)\n\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, I need to test this code with different test cases to ensure it works correctly.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\n\nExpected Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\nExpected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nTest case 3:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nExpected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nTest case 4:\n\nInput: [4, 4, 4, 4]\n\nExpected Output: [4, 4, 4, 4]\n\nTest case 5:\n\nInput: []\n\nExpected Output: []\n\nTest case 6:\n\nInput: [2]\n\nExpected Output: [2]\n\nI should also think about the time and space complexity.\n\nTime Complexity:\n\n- Best case: O(n log n)\n\n- Average case: O(n log n)\n\n- Worst case: O(n^2), which occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot.\n\nSpace Complexity:\n\n- O(log n) due to the recursion stack.\n\nTo improve the worst-case time complexity, I could implement pivot selection strategies like choosing the median of three elements.\n\nBut for this program, selecting the last element as the pivot should suffice.\n\nI should also consider adding comments to the code for clarity.\n\nLet me add some comments:\n\n```\n\ndef quick_sort(arr, low, high):\n\n    if low < high:\n\n        # Partition the array and get the pivot index\n\n        pi = partition(arr, low, high)\n\n        # Recursively sort the sub-array before and after the pivot\n\n        quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)\n\n        quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)\n\ndef partition(arr, low, high):\n\n    # Choose the last element as pivot\n\n    pivot = arr[high]\n\n    # Pointer for the greater element\n\n    i = low - 1\n\n    # Traverse through all elements\n\n    # Compare each element with pivot\n\n    for j in range(low, high):\n\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n\n            # If element smaller than pivot is found\n\n            # Swap it with the greater element pointed by i\n\n            i = i + 1\n\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\n    # Swap the pivot element with the greater element specified by i\n\n    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]\n\n    # Return the position from where partition is done\n\n    return i + 1\n\n# Main function to handle input and output\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    # Take input from user\n\n    arr = list(map(int, input(\"Enter the list of integers: \").split()))\n\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Call quick sort function\n\n    quick_sort(arr, 0, n - 1)\n\n    # Print the sorted array\n\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", arr)\n\n```\n\nThis should work fine. I can run this code with the test cases I thought of earlier to verify its correctness.\n\nI think this covers the requirements. If there are any issues, I can debug and fix them accordingly.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo implement the Quick Sort algorithm in Python, we need to sort a list of integers by recursively partitioning it into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays. \n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Partitioning**:\n    - Select the last element as the pivot.\n    - Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it.\n    - After this step, the pivot is in its final position.\n\n2. **Recursive Sorting**:\n    - Recursively apply the above steps to the subarrays formed by partitioning: one subarray consists of elements before the pivot, and the other consists of elements after the pivot.\n\n## Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr, low, high):\n    if low < high:\n        # Partition the array and get the pivot index\n        pi = partition(arr, low, high)\n        # Recursively sort the sub-array before and after the pivot\n        quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)\n        quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)\n\ndef partition(arr, low, high):\n    # Choose the last element as pivot\n    pivot = arr[high]\n    # Pointer for the greater element\n    i = low - 1\n    # Traverse through all elements\n    # Compare each element with pivot\n    for j in range(low, high):\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n            # If element smaller than pivot is found\n            # Swap it with the greater element pointed by i\n            i = i + 1\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    # Swap the pivot element with the greater element specified by i\n    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]\n    # Return the position from where partition is done\n    return i + 1\n\n# Main function to handle input and output\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Take input from user\n    arr = list(map(int, input(\"Enter the list of integers: \").split()))\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Call quick sort function\n    quick_sort(arr, 0, n - 1)\n    # Print the sorted array\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", arr)\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Partition Function**:\n    - Selects the last element as the pivot.\n    - Uses a pointer `i` to track the position of the last element less than or equal to the pivot.\n    - Iterates through the array with index `j`, and if `arr[j]` is smaller than or equal to the pivot, it swaps `arr[j]` with `arr[i+1]` and increments `i`.\n    - Finally, swaps the pivot element with `arr[i+1]` to place the pivot in its correct position.\n\n2. **Quick Sort Function**:\n    - Recursively sorts the subarrays before and after the pivot index `pi` obtained from the partition function.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n    - Reads a list of integers from the user.\n    - Calls the quick_sort function to sort the list.\n    - Prints the sorted array.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted in place, maintaining the efficiency and characteristics of the Quick Sort algorithm."
