Let's start by searching the web for this information.\n\nPlan: Search Google for \"2020 Nobel Prize in Physics winners\"\n#E1 = GoogleSearch[\"2020 Nobel Prize in Physics winners\"]\n\nOkay, from the search results in #E1, I can see a few websites that seem relevant, like the official Nobel Prize website and some news articles. I should check the official website for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nPlan: Visit the official Nobel Prize website for 2020 Physics laureates\n#E2 = WebScraper[\"URL from #E1\"]\n\nNow, I need to look through the text from #E2 to find the names of the winners and their contributions. Maybe I can use the LLM_QA tool to help extract this information.\n\nPlan: Use LLM_QA to extract winners' names and contributions from #E2\n#E3 = LLM_QA[\"Who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics and what was their contribution?\", #E2]\n\nLet me see what #E3 says. If it provides the information clearly, I can proceed. But if it's unclear or needs more details, I might need to fact-check it.\n\nPlan: Verify the information with FactChecker\n#E4 = FactChecker[#E3]\n\nIf #E4 confirms the information, then I can consider it accurate. However, if there are any discrepancies, I should look for additional sources to corroborate the facts.\n\nPlan: If necessary, search for additional sources\n#E5 = GoogleSearch[\"contributions of 2020 Nobel Physics laureates\"]\n\nThen, scrape those pages for more information.\n\nPlan: Scrape additional sources\n#E6 = WebScraper[\"URL from #E5\"]\n\nAnd again, use LLM_QA to extract and summarize the information.\n\nPlan: Summarize contributions using LLM_QA\n#E7 = LLM_QA[\"What were the key contributions of the 2020 Nobel Physics laureates?\", #E6]\n\nFinally, compile all the information from #E3 and #E7, ensuring that the facts are accurate and consistent across sources.\n\nPlan: Compile final answer\n#E8 = LLM_QA[\"Who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics and what were their contributions, based on #E3 and #E7?\"]\n\nNow, I can present the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: #E8"
