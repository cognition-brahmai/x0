        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a baker uses 15 eggs to make 20 cakes. I need to figure out how many eggs he would need to bake 45 cakes. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many eggs are needed for one cake. That way, I can just multiply that number by 45 to get the total number of eggs needed. Makes sense.\n\nSo, if 15 eggs make 20 cakes, then the number of eggs per cake would be 15 divided by 20. Let me do that calculation: 15 divided by 20 is 0.75 eggs per cake. Okay, so each cake requires 0.75 eggs.\n\nNow, to find out how many eggs are needed for 45 cakes, I'll multiply 0.75 by 45. Let's see: 0.75 times 45.\n\nWell, 0.75 is the same as three-quarters, so three-quarters of 45. Let me calculate that: 45 divided by 4 is 11.25, and 11.25 multiplied by 3 is 33.75. So, 33.75 eggs are needed for 45 cakes.\n\nBut, wait a minute, you can't really use half an egg in baking, can you? Maybe I should think about this differently. Maybe I should look at the ratio of eggs to cakes.\n\nSo, the ratio is 15 eggs to 20 cakes. I can simplify that ratio by dividing both numbers by 5, which gives me 3 eggs for every 4 cakes. So, 3:4 is the simplified ratio.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many eggs are needed for 45 cakes. Let's set up a proportion here.\n\nIf 3 eggs are needed for 4 cakes, then x eggs are needed for 45 cakes.\n\nSo, 3/4 = x/45.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 3 times 45 equals 4 times x.\n\nThat gives me 135 = 4x.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4 to solve for x: x = 135 divided by 4, which is 33.75.\n\nAgain, I get 33.75 eggs. But since you can't really use a fraction of an egg in baking, maybe the baker would need to use 34 eggs, rounding up.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at this. Let's think about how many cakes one egg can make.\n\nIf 15 eggs make 20 cakes, then one egg makes 20 divided by 15 cakes. That's 20/15, which simplifies to 4/3 cakes per egg.\n\nSo, one egg can make 4/3 cakes.\n\nNow, if I have x eggs, and each egg makes 4/3 cakes, then x times 4/3 equals 45 cakes.\n\nSo, x * (4/3) = 45.\n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by 3/4: x = 45 * (3/4).\n\nThat's 45 times 3 divided by 4.\n\n45 times 3 is 135, divided by 4 is again 33.75.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nMaybe I can think in terms of multiples.\n\nIf 15 eggs make 20 cakes, then how many sets of 20 cakes are there in 45 cakes?\n\nWell, 45 divided by 20 is 2.25 sets.\n\nSo, if one set requires 15 eggs, then 2.25 sets would require 15 times 2.25 eggs.\n\nLet's calculate that: 15 times 2.25.\n\n15 times 2 is 30, and 15 times 0.25 is 3.75, so total 33.75 eggs.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this, I end up with 33.75 eggs.\n\nBut in practical terms, eggs are whole items, so the baker would need to use whole eggs.\n\nIf he needs 33.75 eggs, he'll have to use 34 eggs, rounding up, because you can't use half an egg in baking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he can adjust the recipes to use half eggs, but that seems unlikely.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 34 eggs.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't specify whether to round up or down, and in baking, sometimes precision is key.\n\nMaybe I should consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the baker can use 33 eggs, acknowledging that it's a bit less than required, but that might affect the quality or quantity of the cakes.\n\nOr maybe use 34 eggs to ensure all 45 cakes are properly made.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the baker can adjust the number of cakes slightly based on the eggs available.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for 45 cakes, so I think 34 eggs is the way to go, rounding up.\n\nSo, the baker would need 34 eggs to bake 45 cakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{34} \\]"
