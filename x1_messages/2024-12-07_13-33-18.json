        "content": "So, you've got a rectangular garden that's 15 meters long and 8 meters wide, and you want to know two things: first, what's the area of the garden right now, and second, how much bigger the area would get if you increased the width by 50%. Let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, to find the area of a rectangle, you multiply its length by its width. So, for your garden, that would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 15 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 8 \\, \\text{meters} = 120 \\, \\text{square meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, the current area of the garden is 120 square meters.\n\nNow, for the second part, you want to increase the width by 50%. To find out what the new width would be, you need to calculate 50% of the original width and then add that to the original width.\n\nFirst, find 50% of 8 meters:\n\n\\[\n50\\% \\, \\text{of} \\, 8 \\, \\text{meters} = 0.5 \\times 8 = 4 \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, increasing the width by 50% means adding 4 meters to the original 8 meters, making the new width:\n\n\\[\n8 \\, \\text{meters} + 4 \\, \\text{meters} = 12 \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nNow, with the new width of 12 meters and the length still at 15 meters, the new area would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Area} = 15 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 12 \\, \\text{meters} = 180 \\, \\text{square meters}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many square meters would be added, subtract the original area from the new area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Additional Area} = \\text{New Area} - \\text{Original Area} = 180 \\, \\text{square meters} - 120 \\, \\text{square meters} = 60 \\, \\text{square meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, if you increase the width by 50%, you would add 60 square meters to the garden's area.\n\nAlternatively, you could calculate the additional area directly by finding 50% of the original area. Since the length remains the same and only the width is increased by 50%, the area would increase by the same percentage.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Additional Area} = 50\\% \\, \\text{of} \\, \\text{original area} = 0.5 \\times 120 \\, \\text{square meters} = 60 \\, \\text{square meters}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
