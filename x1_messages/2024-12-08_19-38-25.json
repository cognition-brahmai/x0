He was known for his cunning and deceitfulness, and as a punishment for his actions, he was condemned to an eternity of frustration in the underworld. Specifically, he had to roll a massive boulder up a hill, only to have it roll back down just as it reached the top, forcing him to start over again, ad infinitum. It's a powerful symbol of meaningless labor and never-ending tasks."
