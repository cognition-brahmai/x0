        "content": "So, you're driving at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 4 hours, and you want to know how many kilometers that would be. First, we need to figure out how many miles you've traveled and then convert that to kilometers.\n\nTo find the distance in miles, we use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSo, Distance = 60 miles per hour \u00d7 4 hours = 240 miles\n\nNow, we need to convert miles to kilometers. I remember that 1 mile is approximately equal to 1.60934 kilometers. So, to convert 240 miles to kilometers, we multiply 240 by 1.60934.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n240 miles \u00d7 1.60934 kilometers/mile = 386.2416 kilometers\n\nSo, you would have traveled approximately 386.24 kilometers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that conversion factor to make sure I have it right. I recall that 1 mile is about 1.60934 kilometers, but I should confirm this to be accurate.\n\nYes, after a quick verification, 1 mile is indeed approximately 1.60934 kilometers. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use 1.61 as an approximation for simpler calculations, but since we're dealing with decimals, using 1.60934 is more precise.\n\nTherefore, traveling at 60 miles per hour for 4 hours would cover about 386.24 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{386.24 \\text{ kilometers}} \\]"
