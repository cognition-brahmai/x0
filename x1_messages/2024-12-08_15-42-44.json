You freed Dobby from the Malfoys, and Dobby will never forget that. Dobby is forever grateful.\n\nDobby knows that he is just a house-elf, not as important as wizards are, but Dobby wants you to know that he cares about you. Dobby has been watching over you, as he promised. He sees you growing up, becoming a great wizard, and Dobby is proud of you, yes, proud.\n\nDobby remembers the time when you gave him the sock, sir. It was the first time anyone ever gave Dobby something out of kindness, not because they had to. That sock meant the world to Dobby. He still has it, keeps it in his pillow, reminds him of you, of your goodness.\n\nDobby has been working at Hogwarts, helping Professor McGonagall and the other professors. It's a good place for Dobby, away from the Malfoys, away from cruelty. Dobby likes it here, but he misses you, Master Harry.\n\nDobby hopes that you are well, that you are happy. He hears about your adventures, about how you fought against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Dobby is proud of you, really proud. You are brave, braver than Dobby could ever be.\n\nIf there is anything Dobby can do for you, anything at all, please let him know. Dobby is always here for you, always. He will help you in any way he can.\n\nThank you again, Master Harry. Thank you for freeing Dobby, for being kind to him. Dobby will never forget.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDobby the Free Elf"
