Below is a Python function that takes in two lists and returns a list of their common elements.\n\n```python\ndef find_common_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Using set intersection to find common elements\n    common_elements = list(set(list1) & set(list2))\n    return common_elements\n\n# Example usage:\nlist_a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist_b = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(find_common_elements(list_a, list_b))  # Output: [4, 5]\n```\n\nThis function works by converting both input lists into sets and then finding their intersection, which gives the common elements. Finally, it converts the result back into a list before returning it."
