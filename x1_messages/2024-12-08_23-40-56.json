        "content": "Let's see. I have a bag with 10 red balls, 20 blue balls, and 30 green balls. So in total, there are 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 balls. The problem is asking for the minimum number of balls I need to pick without replacement to guarantee that I have at least 3 balls of the same color.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem related to the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle basically says that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole will have more than one pigeon. Extending this, if I want to guarantee a certain number of balls of the same color, I need to consider the worst-case scenario.\n\nSo, in the worst case, I could pick balls in such a way that I delay picking three of the same color as much as possible. That means I'd try to pick as many balls as possible without getting three of any single color.\n\nLet's consider the colors: red, blue, and green.\n\n- Red: there are 10 red balls.\n\n- Blue: 20 blue balls.\n\n- Green: 30 green balls.\n\nIf I pick 2 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 2 green balls, I have 6 balls in total, and none of the colors have 3 balls yet.\n\nWait, but I need to guarantee at least 3 of the same color. So, if I pick 2 of each, that's 6 balls, and still no color has 3 balls. The next ball I pick, the 7th ball, must be either red, blue, or green. Whichever color it is, it will make it 3 balls of that color.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to pick more without getting 3 of the same color. Let's think about it differently.\n\nWhat if I try to maximize the number of balls picked without getting 3 of the same color? That would be picking up to 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green balls, totaling 6 balls.\n\nBut, since there are different quantities of each color, maybe I can exploit that.\n\nFor example, there are fewer red balls (10) than blue (20) and green (30). So, perhaps I can't pick 2 of each if there aren't enough of a certain color.\n\nWait, no. The problem states there are 10 red, 20 blue, and 30 green balls. So, picking 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green is possible because there are at least 2 of each.\n\nBut to guarantee having 3 of the same color, I need to consider the worst-case scenario, which is picking as many balls as possible without reaching 3 of any color, and then picking one more.\n\nSo, in this case, picking 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green balls (6 balls total) without having 3 of any color. The next ball, the 7th one, must be either red, blue, or green, which will make it 3 of that color.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of balls I need to pick to guarantee at least 3 of the same color is 7.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can think of it differently. Suppose I pick all the balls except for two of each color. But that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the worst-case scenario is picking the maximum number of balls without having 3 of any color. That would be picking 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green balls, totaling 6 balls.\n\nPicking one more ball (the 7th ball) will necessarily be either red, blue, or green, thus making it 3 balls of that color.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose I pick 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green balls. That's 6 balls, and I don't have 3 of any color yet. The next ball I pick will be either red, blue, or green, making it 3 of that color.\n\nSo, yes, 7 balls is the minimum number I need to pick to guarantee at least 3 of the same color.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
