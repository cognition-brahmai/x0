        "content": "Alright, I've got this task to build a Golang command-line tool that reads a CSV file with names and email addresses and then sends personalized greeting emails to each recipient using AWS Simple Email Service (SES). Sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I cover all the bases here.\n\nFirst things first, I need to set up my development environment. I have Go installed, and I'm familiar with creating command-line tools in Go. I also have some experience with AWS services, including SES, so that should help.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Read the CSV file:** The CSV will contain names and email addresses. I need to parse this file and extract each recipient's name and email.\n\n2. **Set up AWS SES:** I need to configure AWS SES to send emails. This includes setting up the necessary credentials and ensuring that my SES account is verified and ready to send emails.\n\n3. **Send personalized emails:** For each recipient, I need to construct a personalized email greeting and use SES to send it.\n\nI should also consider error handling and make sure that the tool provides feedback on which emails were sent successfully and which ones failed.\n\n### Step 1: Read the CSV file\n\nI need to read a CSV file that contains at least two columns: names and email addresses. I should use Go's `encoding/csv` package to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to define the structure to hold the recipient's information.\n\n```go\ntype Recipient struct {\n    Name  string\n    Email string\n}\n```\n\nThen, I'll write a function to read the CSV file and return a slice of `Recipient`.\n\n```go\nfunc readCSV(filePath string) ([]Recipient, error) {\n    file, err := os.Open(filePath)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    defer file.Close()\n\n    reader := csv.NewReader(file)\n    records, err := reader.ReadAll()\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n\n    var recipients []Recipient\n    for _, record := range records {\n        if len(record) < 2 {\n            continue // Skip incomplete records\n        }\n        recipients = append(recipients, Recipient{Name: record[0], Email: record[1]})\n    }\n\n    return recipients, nil\n}\n```\n\nI need to make sure that the CSV file has headers, and I might need to skip the header row when reading the records.\n\n### Step 2: Set up AWS SES\n\nTo use AWS SES in Go, I need to use the `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session` and `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/signer/v4` packages, among others.\n\nFirst, I need to configure AWS credentials. I can do this by setting up the AWS SDK to use environment variables, IAM roles, or by providing credentials directly.\n\nI'll assume that the AWS credentials are set up in the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.\n\nI need to create an SES session:\n\n```go\nsess, err := session.NewSession(&aws.Config{\n    Region: aws.String(\"us-west-2\")}, // Replace with your AWS region\n)\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to create AWS session: %s\", err)\n}\n\nses := ses.New(sess)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Send personalized emails\n\nFor each recipient, I need to construct an email message that includes a personalized greeting, such as \"Hello, [Name]!\".\n\nI'll use the `ses.SendEmail` method to send each email.\n\nHere's a sample function to send an email:\n\n```go\nfunc sendEmail(ses *ses.SES, recipient Recipient, fromEmail string, subject string, body string) error {\n    input := &ses.SendEmailInput{\n        Destination: &ses.Destination{\n            ToAddresses: []*string{aws.String(recipient.Email)},\n        },\n        Message: &ses.Message{\n            Body: &ses.Body{\n                Text: &ses.Content{\n                    Data: aws.String(body),\n                },\n            },\n            Subject: &ses.Content{\n                Data: aws.String(subject),\n            },\n        },\n        Source: aws.String(fromEmail),\n    }\n\n    _, err := ses.SendEmail(input)\n    return err\n}\n```\n\nI need to make sure that the `fromEmail` address is verified in my SES account.\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nNow, I'll write the main function that reads the CSV, sets up SES, and sends emails to each recipient.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    if len(os.Args) != 3 {\n        fmt.Println(\"Usage: go run main.go /path/to/csv from_email\")\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n\n    csvPath := os.Args[1]\n    fromEmail := os.Args[2]\n\n    recipients, err := readCSV(csvPath)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to read CSV: %s\", err)\n    }\n\n    sess, err := session.NewSession(&aws.Config{\n        Region: aws.String(\"us-west-2\")}, // Replace with your AWS region\n    )\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to create AWS session: %s\", err)\n    }\n\n    ses := ses.New(sess)\n\n    subject := \"Greetings!\"\n    for _, recipient := range recipients {\n        body := fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello, %s!\\nThis is a personalized greeting from our system.\", recipient.Name)\n        err := sendEmail(ses, recipient, fromEmail, subject, body)\n        if err != nil {\n            log.Printf(\"Failed to send email to %s: %s\", recipient.Email, err)\n        } else {\n            log.Printf(\"Email sent to %s\", recipient.Email)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Error Handling:** I need to handle errors gracefully, especially when sending emails, to log which emails failed to send.\n\n- **Rate Limiting:** AWS SES has sending limits. If I have a large number of emails to send, I need to handle rate limiting appropriately.\n\n- **Email Content:** Ensure that the email content is properly formatted and does not trigger spam filters.\n\n- **Security:** Make sure that sensitive information, like AWS credentials, is handled securely.\n\n- **Testing:** Test the tool with a small set of emails before sending to the entire list.\n\nThis should cover the basic requirements of the task. I might need to add more features or handle edge cases based on specific requirements or constraints.\n"
