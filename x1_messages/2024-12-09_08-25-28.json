        "content": "So I've got this problem here about forming a committee with some specific constraints. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\n\"A committee of 5 people must be formed from a group of 7 mathematicians and 6 physicists. If at least 3 members of the committee must be mathematicians, how many different committees can be formed?\"\n\nAlright, so we have a total of 7 mathematicians and 6 physicists, making it 13 people in total. We need to form a committee of 5 people from these 13, but with the condition that at least 3 of them must be mathematicians.\n\nFirst, I need to interpret what \"at least 3 mathematicians\" means. It means that the committee can have either 3, 4, or 5 mathematicians. So, I need to consider all these cases separately and then add up the number of possibilities for each case.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 mathematicians and 2 physicists.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 mathematicians from 7:\n\nThis is a combination problem, since the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (3! * 4!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 210 / 6 = 35.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 physicists from 6:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = (6 * 5 * 4!) / (2! * 4!)) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nNow, since these are independent choices, the total number of committees with exactly 3 mathematicians and 2 physicists is the product of these two combinations:\n\n35 * 15 = 525.\n\nAlright, that's the first case. Now, let's move on to the second case: exactly 4 mathematicians and 1 physicist.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 4 mathematicians from 7:\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7 - 4)!) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (4! * 3!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 210 / 6 = 35.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 physicist from 6:\n\nC(6, 1) = 6! / (1! * (6 - 1)!) = (6 * 5!) / (1! * 5!)) = 6 / 1 = 6.\n\nSo, the total number of committees with exactly 4 mathematicians and 1 physicist is:\n\n35 * 6 = 210.\n\nNow, the third and final case: exactly 5 mathematicians and 0 physicists.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 5 mathematicians from 7:\n\nC(7, 5) = 7! / (5! * (7 - 5)!) = (7 * 6 * 5!) / (5! * 2!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 42 / 2 = 21.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 0 physicists from 6:\n\nC(6, 0) = 1 (since there's only one way to choose nothing).\n\nSo, the total number of committees with exactly 5 mathematicians and 0 physicists is:\n\n21 * 1 = 21.\n\nNow, to find the total number of possible committees that satisfy the condition of having at least 3 mathematicians, I need to add up the numbers from all three cases:\n\n525 (for 3 mathematicians) + 210 (for 4 mathematicians) + 21 (for 5 mathematicians) = 525 + 210 = 735, and 735 + 21 = 756.\n\nTherefore, there are 756 different committees that can be formed under these constraints.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst case: C(7, 3) * C(6, 2) = 35 * 15 = 525. That seems correct.\n\nSecond case: C(7, 4) * C(6, 1) = 35 * 6 = 210. That's also correct.\n\nThird case: C(7, 5) * C(6, 0) = 21 * 1 = 21. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 525 + 210 = 735, and 735 + 21 = 756. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently to verify. Since C(7, k) is the same as C(7, 7 - k), I can see that C(7, 3) = C(7, 4), which is consistent with my earlier calculation that C(7, 3) = 35 and C(7, 4) = 35.\n\nAlso, C(7, 5) = C(7, 2) = 21, which matches what I have.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the total number is 756.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that have fewer than 3 mathematicians.\n\nTotal number of committees without restrictions: C(13, 5) = 1287.\n\nNumber of committees with fewer than 3 mathematicians means committees with 0, 1, or 2 mathematicians.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nNumber of committees with 0 mathematicians and 5 physicists: C(7, 0) * C(6, 5) = 1 * 6 = 6.\n\nNumber of committees with 1 mathematician and 4 physicists: C(7, 1) * C(6, 4) = 7 * 15 = 105.\n\nNumber of committees with 2 mathematicians and 3 physicists: C(7, 2) * C(6, 3) = 21 * 20 = 420.\n\nAdding these up: 6 + 105 = 111, and 111 + 420 = 531.\n\nSo, the number of committees with fewer than 3 mathematicians is 531.\n\nTherefore, the number of committees with at least 3 mathematicians is the total number of committees minus these 531 committees:\n\n1287 - 531 = 756.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation, so I'm even more confident now.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check the value of C(13, 5):\n\nC(13, 5) = 13! / (5! * 8!) = (13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8!) / (5! * 8!)) = (13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / 120 = (154,440) / 120 = 1,287.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 756 different committees that can be formed with at least 3 mathematicians from a group of 7 mathematicians and 6 physicists.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{756} \\]"
