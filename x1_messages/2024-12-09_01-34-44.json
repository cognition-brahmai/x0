According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the average full-time employee worked 37.7 hours per week in 2020, which is higher than the 35-hour standard workweek that was common in the past. Additionally, there has been an increase in the number of people working from home, which can lead to longer working hours as the boundaries between work and personal life become blurred."
