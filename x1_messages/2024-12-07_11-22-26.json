        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a class with 15 boys and 10 girls, and we need to form a committee of 6 students. The catch is that the committee must include at least one boy and at least one girl. We're supposed to find out how many different committees can be formed under these conditions.\n\nFirst, I think I should recall how to calculate combinations because the order in which we select the students doesn't matter here. The formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 6 students out of 25 without any restrictions would be \\( C(25, 6) \\). But, we have to ensure that there's at least one boy and one girl in the committee.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtract the number of committees that consist solely of boys or solely of girls. This way, we're left with the number of committees that have at least one boy and one girl.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of unrestricted committees:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 6) = \\frac{25!}{6!(25 - 6)!} = \\frac{25!}{6! \\cdot 19!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating factorials directly can be cumbersome, but we can simplify this expression by canceling out the common terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n\n\\[\nC(25, 6) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20}{720}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute the numerator step by step:\n\n\\[\n25 \\times 24 = 600 \\\\\n600 \\times 23 = 13,800 \\\\\n13,800 \\times 22 = 303,600 \\\\\n303,600 \\times 21 = 6,375,600 \\\\\n6,375,600 \\times 20 = 127,512,000\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{127,512,000}{720} = 176,800\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 176,800 possible committees without any restrictions.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of committees that are all boys or all girls.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of all-boy committees. There are 15 boys, and we need to choose 6:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 6) = \\frac{15!}{6!(15 - 6)!} = \\frac{15!}{6! \\cdot 9!}\n\\]\n\nAgain, simplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 6) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{720}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the numerator step by step:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 14 = 210 \\\\\n210 \\times 13 = 2,730 \\\\\n2,730 \\times 12 = 32,760 \\\\\n32,760 \\times 11 = 360,360 \\\\\n360,360 \\times 10 = 3,603,600\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3,603,600}{720} = 5,005\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 5,005 all-boy committees.\n\nNow, calculate the number of all-girl committees. There are 10 girls, and we need to choose 6:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 6) = \\frac{10!}{6!(10 - 6)!} = \\frac{10!}{6! \\cdot 4!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 6) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{24}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the numerator step by step:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 9 = 90 \\\\\n90 \\times 8 = 720 \\\\\n720 \\times 7 = 5,040\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5,040}{24} = 210\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 210 all-girl committees.\n\nNow, to find the number of committees that have at least one boy and one girl, we subtract the number of all-boy and all-girl committees from the total number of committees:\n\n\\[\n176,800 - (5,005 + 210) = 176,800 - 5,215 = 171,585\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 171,585 different committees that can be formed, each containing at least one boy and one girl.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is to calculate the number of committees with at least one boy and one girl directly, without subtracting the unwanted cases. This can be done by considering all possible combinations where there is at least one boy and at least one girl.\n\nThis would involve summing the combinations for committees with 1 boy and 5 girls, 2 boys and 4 girls, up to 5 boys and 1 girl.\n\nSo, the total number of desired committees would be:\n\n\\[\nC(15,1) \\times C(10,5) + C(15,2) \\times C(10,4) + C(15,3) \\times C(10,3) + C(15,4) \\times C(10,2) + C(15,5) \\times C(10,1)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate each term step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( C(15,1) \\times C(10,5) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(15,1) = 15 \\\\\nC(10,5) = \\frac{10!}{5! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{30,240}{120} = 252 \\\\\n\\text{So, } 15 \\times 252 = 3,780\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( C(15,2) \\times C(10,4) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(15,2) = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1} = 105 \\\\\nC(10,4) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{5,040}{24} = 210 \\\\\n\\text{So, } 105 \\times 210 = 22,050\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( C(15,3) \\times C(10,3) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(15,3) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{2,730}{6} = 455 \\\\\nC(10,3) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{720}{6} = 120 \\\\\n\\text{So, } 455 \\times 120 = 54,600\n\\]\n\nNext, \\( C(15,4) \\times C(10,2) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(15,4) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{32,760}{24} = 1,365 \\\\\nC(10,2) = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45 \\\\\n\\text{So, } 1,365 \\times 45 = 61,425\n\\]\n\nFinally, \\( C(15,5) \\times C(10,1) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(15,5) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{360,360}{120} = 3,003 \\\\\nC(10,1) = 10 \\\\\n\\text{So, } 3,003 \\times 10 = 30,030\n\\]\n\nNow, sum all these products:\n\n\\[\n3,780 + 22,050 + 54,600 + 61,425 + 30,030 = 171,885\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, this total (171,885) doesn't match the previous result (171,585) obtained by subtracting the all-boy and all-girl committees from the total number of committees. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, the subtraction method:\n\nTotal committees: \\( C(25,6) = 176,800 \\)\n\nAll-boy committees: \\( C(15,6) = 5,005 \\)\n\nAll-girl committees: \\( C(10,6) = 210 \\)\n\nSo, committees with at least one boy and one girl: \\( 176,800 - (5,005 + 210) = 176,800 - 5,215 = 171,585 \\)\n\nNow, the addition method:\n\nSum of committees with 1 boy and 5 girls, 2 boys and 4 girls, etc.\n\nCalculations:\n\n1 boy and 5 girls: \\( 15 \\times 252 = 3,780 \\)\n\n2 boys and 4 girls: \\( 105 \\times 210 = 22,050 \\)\n\n3 boys and 3 girls: \\( 455 \\times 120 = 54,600 \\)\n\n4 boys and 2 girls: \\( 1,365 \\times 45 = 61,425 \\)\n\n5 boys and 1 girl: \\( 3,003 \\times 10 = 30,030 \\)\n\nSum: \\( 3,780 + 22,050 = 25,830 \\)\n\n\\( 25,830 + 54,600 = 80,430 \\)\n\n\\( 80,430 + 61,425 = 141,855 \\)\n\n\\( 141,855 + 30,030 = 171,885 \\)\n\nThere's a difference of 300 between 171,585 and 171,885. This suggests I might have made an error in one of the calculations.\n\nLet me check the calculation of \\( C(10,5) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(10,5) = \\frac{10!}{5! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{30,240}{120} = 252\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, \\( C(15,1) \\times C(10,5) = 15 \\times 252 = 3,780 \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nNext, \\( C(15,2) = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2} = 105 \\), and \\( C(10,4) = 210 \\), so \\( 105 \\times 210 = 22,050 \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nThen, \\( C(15,3) = 455 \\), \\( C(10,3) = 120 \\), so \\( 455 \\times 120 = 54,600 \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nNext, \\( C(15,4) = 1,365 \\), \\( C(10,2) = 45 \\), so \\( 1,365 \\times 45 = 61,425 \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nFinally, \\( C(15,5) = 3,003 \\), \\( C(10,1) = 10 \\), so \\( 3,003 \\times 10 = 30,030 \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nSumming them up: \\( 3,780 + 22,050 = 25,830 \\)\n\n\\( 25,830 + 54,600 = 80,430 \\)\n\n\\( 80,430 + 61,425 = 141,855 \\)\n\n\\( 141,855 + 30,030 = 171,885 \\)\n\nBut earlier, by subtraction, I got 171,585.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction method.\n\nTotal committees: \\( C(25,6) = 176,800 \\)\n\nAll-boy committees: \\( C(15,6) = 5,005 \\)\n\nAll-girl committees: \\( C(10,6) = 210 \\)\n\nSo, committees with at least one boy and one girl: \\( 176,800 - (5,005 + 210) = 176,800 - 5,215 = 171,585 \\)\n\nBut according to the addition method, it's 171,885.\n\nThere's a discrepancy of 300.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated \\( C(15,5) \\times C(10,1) \\).
