        "content": "Let's see if I can figure this out. So, there are 20 houses in the village, and each house has one dog. These dogs bark at every cat in the village. Overall, there are 100 barking incidents per day. I need to find out how many cats there are in the village.\n\nFirst, I should understand the relationship between the dogs and the cats. Each dog barks at every cat. So, if there are c cats in the village, each dog will bark at all c cats. Since there are 20 dogs, the total number of barking incidents should be 20 times c, right?\n\nSo, total barking incidents = number of dogs \u00d7 number of cats\n\nThat gives me:\n\n20 \u00d7 c = 100\n\nNow, to find c, I can divide both sides by 20:\n\nc = 100 \u00f7 20\n\nc = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 cats in the village.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If there are 5 cats and 20 dogs, and each dog barks at each cat, then indeed, each dog barks 5 times (once at each cat). So, 20 dogs \u00d7 5 barks per dog = 100 barks. That matches the given total of 100 barking incidents per day.\n\nI think that makes sense. Unless there's something else to consider, like maybe some dogs don't bark at certain cats or something, but the problem says each dog barks at every cat. So, no, that seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
