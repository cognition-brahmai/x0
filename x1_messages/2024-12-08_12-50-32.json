        "content": "D. Homolytic fission\n\nHomolytic fission is the process where a covalent bond breaks symmetrically, resulting in each atom retaining one electron from the bond, thus forming two radical species. This type of bond cleavage typically requires the input of energy, such as heat or light.\n\n- **Addition reaction**: This is a reaction where two or more molecules combine to form a single product. For example, the addition of hydrogen to an alkene to form an alkane.\n\n- **Substitution reaction**: In this type of reaction, an atom or a group of atoms in a molecule is replaced by another atom or group. For example, the replacement of a chlorine atom in methane (CH\u2084) by a bromine atom to form bromomethane.\n\n- **Elimination reaction**: This involves the removal of two atoms or groups from a molecule, often resulting in the formation of a double bond. For example, the dehydration of an alcohol to form an alkene.\n\n- **Homolytic fission**: This is specifically the splitting of a covalent bond into two radicals, each carrying one electron from the original bond. This process is crucial in radical reactions and is often initiated by heat or light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Homolytic fission."
