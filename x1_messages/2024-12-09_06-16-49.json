        "content": "So the train goes from Town A to Town B at 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours. Then it waits for 1 hour in Town B before coming back to Town A at the same speed. I need to find out the total time for the round trip.\n\nFirst, the trip from A to B takes 2 hours. Since the speed is constant at 60 miles per hour, I can confirm the distance between A and B. Distance equals speed times time, so that's 60 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nThen, the train waits for 1 hour in Town B. So, I need to add that waiting time to the total time.\n\nAfter that, the train returns from B to A at the same speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance is the same, 120 miles, so the time for the return trip should also be 2 hours.\n\nSo, total time is the time from A to B plus waiting time plus time from B back to A. That's 2 hours + 1 hour + 2 hours, which equals 5 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the speed is constant and the distance is the same, then the time should indeed be the same for both legs of the trip.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the total distance traveled and then divide by the speed, but since there's a waiting time involved, I need to add that separately.\n\nTotal distance is 120 miles to B and 120 miles back to A, so 240 miles in total. At 60 miles per hour, the total traveling time would be 240 miles divided by 60 miles per hour, which is 4 hours. Plus the 1 hour waiting time, that totals 5 hours.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is 5 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
