The expression is:\n\n((6 - 2)^2 + (9 / 3) - 5) * 3 + 10\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Calculate (6 - 2):\n\n6 - 2 = 4\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n(4^2 + (9 / 3) - 5) * 3 + 10\n\n2. Next, calculate the exponent:\n\n4^2 = 16\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n(16 + (9 / 3) - 5) * 3 + 10\n\n3. Now, handle the division:\n\n9 / 3 = 3\n\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n\n(16 + 3 - 5) * 3 + 10\n\n4. Perform the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses from left to right:\n\n16 + 3 = 19\n\n19 - 5 = 14\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n14 * 3 + 10\n\n5. Next, perform the multiplication:\n\n14 * 3 = 42\n\nSo now we have:\n\n42 + 10\n\n6. Finally, perform the addition:\n\n42 + 10 = 52\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 52.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{52} \\]"
