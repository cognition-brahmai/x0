        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 6 red balls, 8 blue balls, and 10 green balls. So, in total, there are 6 + 8 + 10 = 24 balls in the bag.\n\nThe question is about finding the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball without replacing the first ball drawn. Okay, so it's a sequence of two events: first drawing a red ball, and then, without putting it back, drawing a blue ball.\n\nProbability of multiple events happening in sequence is the product of their individual probabilities, given that the previous events have occurred. In this case, since we're not replacing the first ball, the total number of balls decreases by one after the first draw.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, find the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw.\n\nThere are 6 red balls out of a total of 24 balls, so the probability is 6/24. Simplifying that, it's 1/4.\n\nWait, 6 divided by 24 is indeed 1/4.\n\nNow, given that a red ball has been drawn and not replaced, the total number of balls left in the bag is 24 - 1 = 23 balls.\n\nThe number of blue balls remains the same, which is 8, because we drew a red ball, not a blue one.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a blue ball on the second draw, given that the first draw was a red ball, is 8/23.\n\nNow, to find the overall probability of both events happening in sequence, we multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\nSo, overall probability = (probability of first event) \u00d7 (probability of second event given the first has occurred)\n\nThat is, overall probability = (6/24) \u00d7 (8/23)\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 6/24 simplifies to 1/4.\n\nThen, 1/4 multiplied by 8/23 is (1 \u00d7 8) / (4 \u00d7 23) = 8/92.\n\nSimplifying 8/92 by dividing numerator and denominator by 4, we get 2/23.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/23.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nTotal balls initially: 24\n\nRed balls: 6\n\nBlue balls: 8\n\nGreen balls: 10\n\nFirst draw: red ball, probability 6/24 = 1/4\n\nAfter drawing a red ball and not replacing it, total balls left: 23\n\nBlue balls still: 8\n\nSo, probability of drawing a blue ball next: 8/23\n\nOverall probability: (1/4) \u00d7 (8/23) = (1 \u00d7 8) / (4 \u00d7 23) = 8/92 = 2/23\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of permutations.\n\nThe number of ways to draw a red ball first and then a blue ball is the number of red balls times the number of blue balls, which is 6 \u00d7 8 = 48.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw two balls in sequence without replacement is 24 \u00d7 23 = 552.\n\nSo, the probability is 48/552, which simplifies to 2/23.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, using combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one red and one blue in sequence is C(6,1) \u00d7 C(8,1) = 6 \u00d7 8 = 48.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any two balls in sequence without replacement is C(24,1) \u00d7 C(23,1) = 24 \u00d7 23 = 552.\n\nSo, probability is again 48/552 = 2/23.\n\nAll methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball without replacement is 2/23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{23}} \\]"
