I'm late!\"\nEchoed through the air so freighted,\nAs Alice chased, in a race against time.\n\nIn this world of the illogical,\nWhere the Queen screamed, \"Off with his head!\"\nAlice stood tall, fearless and bright,\nKnowing that all was a wondrous sight,\nIn the dreams of the night.\n\nSo here's to Alice, brave and true,\nIn Wonderland, her adventures anew.\nWith a heart full of wonder,\nAnd a mind that would ponder,\nThe mysteries that Carroll imbued."
