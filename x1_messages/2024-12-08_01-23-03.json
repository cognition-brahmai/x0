        "content": "Okay, I'll try to create a simple command-line calculator in C++ that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square roots, and exponentiation. I'm not super experienced with C++, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a basic structure for the calculator. It should prompt the user to choose an operation and then input the necessary numbers. For operations like square root and exponentiation, which might only require one number, I need to handle that differently from operations that require two numbers, like addition and subtraction.\n\nI should include error handling, especially for division by zero and maybe for invalid inputs. Also, for the square root function, I need to make sure that the user doesn't try to take the square root of a negative number, unless I want to get into complex numbers, which might be too complicated for a basic calculator.\n\nLet me start by including the necessary headers. I'll need <iostream> for input and output, <cmath> for mathematical functions like sqrt and pow, and maybe <limits> to handle invalid inputs.\n\nI'll create a loop that keeps running until the user decides to exit. Inside the loop, I'll display a menu of operations and ask the user to select one. Based on the user's choice, I'll prompt for the appropriate number of inputs and perform the calculation.\n\nFor addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, I'll need two numbers. For square root, I'll need one number, and for exponentiation, I'll need a base and an exponent, which could be any real numbers, but I'll start with integers for simplicity.\n\nI should also think about how to handle different data types. Probably, using floating-point numbers would be best to accommodate decimal results, especially for division and square roots.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline:\n\n1. Include necessary headers.\n\n2. Use a loop to keep the calculator running.\n\n3. Display operation options.\n\n4. Read user's choice.\n\n5. Based on the choice:\n\na. If addition, subtraction, multiplication, division:\n\ni. Ask for two numbers.\n\nii. Perform the operation.\n\niii. Display the result.\n\nb. If square root:\n\ni. Ask for one number.\n\nii. Check if it's non-negative.\n\niii. Compute and display the square root.\n\nc. If exponentiation:\n\ni. Ask for the base and the exponent.\n\nii. Compute and display the result.\n\n6. Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.\n\n7. If not, exit the loop and end the program.\n\nI need to make sure that the program doesn't crash if the user enters invalid inputs, like letters instead of numbers. I can use input validation to handle such cases.\n\nAlso, for the exponentiation function, C++'s <cmath> library has the pow function, which can handle floating-point bases and exponents.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the menu. I can use a switch statement for the operation choices. That seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider adding an option to exit the calculator gracefully.\n\nMaybe I can assign numbers to each operation:\n\n1. Addition\n\n2. Subtraction\n\n3. Multiplication\n\n4. Division\n\n5. Square Root\n\n6. Exponentiation\n\n7. Exit\n\nThen, based on the user's input, perform the corresponding operation.\n\nNow, for reading inputs, I'll use std::cin. But I need to handle cases where the user enters something that's not a number.\n\nI can use std::cin's fail state to check if the input is valid. If it's not, I can prompt the user to enter a valid number.\n\nLet me consider writing a function to read a valid double input to reuse it for multiple inputs.\n\nSomething like:\n\ndouble getValidDoubleInput(const std::string& prompt) {\n\ndouble value;\n\nwhile (true) {\n\nstd::cout << prompt;\n\nif (std::cin >> value) {\n\nreturn value;\n\n} else {\n\nstd::cout << \"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\\n\";\n\nstd::cin.clear();\n\nstd::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThis function will keep asking the user until a valid double is entered.\n\nSimilarly, I can create a function to get the operation choice.\n\nint getOperationChoice() {\n\nint choice;\n\nwhile (true) {\n\ndisplayMenu();\n\nstd::cout << \"Enter your choice: \";\n\nif (std::cin >> choice && choice >= 1 && choice <= 7) {\n\nreturn choice;\n\n} else {\n\nstd::cout << \"Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\\n\";\n\nstd::cin.clear();\n\nstd::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\\n');\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nIn the displayMenu function, I'll print the list of operations with their corresponding numbers.\n\nNow, for each operation, I'll need to handle the inputs accordingly.\n\nFor addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, it's straightforward. Read two numbers and apply the operation.\n\nFor division, I need to check if the denominator is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nFor square root, read one number and ensure it's non-negative.\n\nIf it's negative, I can either display an error message or, if I'm feeling adventurous, handle complex numbers, but that might be overkill for a basic calculator.\n\nFor exponentiation, read two numbers: the base and the exponent, and use the pow function.\n\nI should also think about formatting the output to a certain number of decimal places, especially for floating-point results, to make it more readable.\n\nMaybe use std::fixed and std::setprecision from <iomanip> to control the number of decimal places.\n\nLet me outline the main function:\n\nint main() {\n\ndo {\n\nint choice = getOperationChoice();\n\nswitch (choice) {\n\ncase 1:\n\n// addition\n\nhandleAddition();\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 2:\n\n// subtraction\n\nhandleSubtraction();\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 3:\n\n// multiplication\n\nhandleMultiplication();\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 4:\n\n// division\n\nhandleDivision();\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 5:\n\n// square root\n\nhandleSquareRoot();\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 6:\n\n// exponentiation\n\nhandleExponentiation();\n\nbreak;\n\ncase 7:\n\n// exit\n\nstd::cout << \"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\\n\";\n\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\n} while (wantToContinue());\n\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\nI need to implement the handle* functions for each operation and a wantToContinue function to ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.\n\nIn each handle* function, I'll use the getValidDoubleInput function to read the necessary inputs and perform the calculation.\n\nFor example, handleAddition could look like:\n\nvoid handleAddition() {\n\ndouble num1 = getValidDoubleInput(\"Enter first number: \");\n\ndouble num2 = getValidDoubleInput(\"Enter second number: \");\n\ndouble result = num1 + num2;\n\nstd::cout << \"Result: \" << result << std::endl;\n\n}\n\nSimilarly for other operations, with appropriate checks for division by zero and negative square roots.\n\nFor exponentiation, I need to consider that the pow function can handle negative bases with integer exponents, but might give domain errors for negative bases with fractional exponents.\n\nI might need to add checks for that, but to keep it simple, I'll assume that the user enters valid inputs for exponentiation.\n\nAlso, I should consider using exceptions to handle errors, but since I'm aiming for a basic calculator, I'll stick with simple if-else checks and error messages.\n\nLet me think about the user experience. After each calculation, I'll ask the user if they want to perform another calculation. If they say yes, the calculator continues; otherwise, it exits.\n\nI can implement the wantToContinue function to read y/Y or n/N and decide accordingly.\n\nSomething like:\n\nbool wantToContinue() {\n\nchar response;\n\nstd::cout << \"Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): \";\n\nstd::cin >> response;\n\nreturn (response == 'y' || response == 'Y');\n\n}\n\nI should also handle cases where the user enters something other than y or n, but for simplicity, I'll assume they enter y or n.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan. Now, I'll start writing the code based on this outline.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo create a basic command-line calculator in C++ that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and power operations, follow the steps below.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Include necessary headers**: Use `<iostream>`, `<cmath>`, and `<limits>` for input, output, mathematical operations, and handling invalid inputs.\n2. **Create input validation functions**: Ensure that the inputs provided by the user are valid numbers.\n3. **Implement operation functions**: Define functions for each mathematical operation.\n4. **Use a loop to keep the calculator running**: Allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.\n5. **Handle errors gracefully**: Check for division by zero and negative square roots.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <limits>\n#include <iomanip>\n\n// Function to get a valid double input from the user\ndouble getValidDoubleInput(const std::string& prompt) {\n    double value;\n    while (true) {\n        std::cout << prompt;\n        if (std::cin >> value) {\n            return value;\n        } else {\n            std::cout << \"Invalid input.
