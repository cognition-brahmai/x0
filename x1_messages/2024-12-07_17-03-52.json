        "content": "So the factory makes 500 units of product A each day, and each of those units needs 3 units of raw material B. I need to find out how much raw material B is needed for 45 days of production.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much raw material B is used per day. Since each product A requires 3 units of B, and they make 500 of product A daily, I can multiply 500 by 3 to get the daily consumption of B.\n\nSo, 500 units of A times 3 units of B per A would be:\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 units of B per day.\n\nNow, to find out for 45 days, I need to multiply the daily consumption of B by 45.\n\n1500 units/day * 45 days = ?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1500 * 45.\n\nI can break this down: 1500 * 40 = 60,000 and 1500 * 5 = 7,500.\n\nAdding those together: 60,000 + 7,500 = 67,500.\n\nSo, the factory would need 67,500 units of raw material B for 45 days of production.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- 500 units of A per day.\n\n- Each A requires 3 units of B.\n\n- So, per day: 500 * 3 = 1,500 units of B.\n\n- Over 45 days: 1,500 * 45.\n\nLet me verify 1,500 * 45.\n\n1,500 * 40 = 60,000.\n\n1,500 * 5 = 7,500.\n\nTotal: 60,000 + 7,500 = 67,500.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as:\n\nTotal units of A in 45 days: 500 units/day * 45 days = 22,500 units of A.\n\nEach unit of A requires 3 units of B, so total B needed: 22,500 * 3 = 67,500 units of B.\n\nEither way, I end up with 67,500 units of B required for 45 days of production.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{67500} \\]"
