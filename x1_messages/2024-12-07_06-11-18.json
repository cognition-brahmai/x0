        "content": "Alright, I have this task to create a Python script that reads a text file and counts the number of words, sentences, and paragraphs. The file has multiple lines of text, and sentences are ended with periods, question marks, or exclamation points. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to read a text file in Python. I remember that Python has a built-in function for opening files, something like `open()`. So, I'll need to open the file in read mode.\n\nNext, I need to count the words. Words are usually separated by spaces, so I can split the text into words based on spaces. But I have to be careful with punctuation. For example, a word followed by a period should be considered as one word. So, I might need to remove punctuation before splitting.\n\nFor sentences, they end with periods, question marks, or exclamation points. So, I can look for these characters to count the sentences.\n\nParagraphs are separated by blank lines. In terms of text, a blank line is probably represented by a newline character, maybe `\\n\\n` since each paragraph is separated by an empty line.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Open the text file and read its content.\n\n2. Count the number of words.\n\n3. Count the number of sentences.\n\n4. Count the number of paragraphs.\n\n5. Print these counts.\n\nStarting with opening the file. I need to handle file I/O carefully to avoid errors. I should use the `with` statement to ensure the file is properly closed after reading.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\nwith open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:\n\ncontent = file.read()\n\n```\n\nNow, for counting words, I need to split the text into words. But as I thought earlier, punctuation can be tricky. Maybe I can use the `split()` function and split on spaces, but I need to handle punctuation attached to words.\n\nPerhaps using the `split()` function and then stripping punctuation from each word would be a better approach.\n\nWait, Python has a `string` module that contains a `punctuation` variable which includes all punctuation characters. I can use that to remove punctuation from the text before splitting into words.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n```\n\nimport string\n\ncontent = content.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))\n\nwords = content.split()\n\nnum_words = len(words)\n\n```\n\nThis should give me the number of words.\n\nNext, counting sentences. Sentences end with '.', '?', or '!'. So, I can split the text based on these characters.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I'm not counting decimals or other uses of '.' as sentence endings. This might be a bit tricky.\n\nOne way is to split the text on these characters and then count the non-empty parts.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\nsentences = content.split('.').split('?').split('!')\n\nnum_sentences = len(sentences) - sentences.count('')\n\n```\n\nWait, that might not work because `split()` is a method that can only be split on one delimiter at a time. So, I need a different approach.\n\nMaybe I can use the `re` module, which is Python's regular expression module, to split the text on these punctuation marks.\n\nLike this:\n\n```\n\nimport re\n\nsentences = re.split(r'[.!?]', content)\n\nnum_sentences = len(sentences) - sentences.count('')\n\n```\n\nThis should split the text at each occurrence of '.', '?', or '!', and then I can count the non-empty sentences.\n\nAlright, moving on to paragraphs. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. In text files, blank lines are usually represented by '\\n\\n', especially in files read in text mode.\n\nSo, I can split the content based on '\\n\\n' to get paragraphs.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\nparagraphs = content.split('\\n\\n')\n\nnum_paragraphs = len(paragraphs) - paragraphs.count('')\n\n```\n\nThis should give me the number of paragraphs, excluding any empty ones.\n\nWait, but I need to consider if there are leading or trailing blank lines. Maybe I should use the `strip()` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n```\n\nparagraphs = content.strip().split('\\n\\n')\n\nnum_paragraphs = len(paragraphs)\n\n```\n\nSince `strip()` removes leading and trailing whitespace, and splitting on '\\n\\n' should give me the paragraphs.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nI need to make sure that I'm reading the file correctly and handling any encoding issues. Assuming the file is in UTF-8, which is standard, I should be fine.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the file might not exist or there are permission issues. Maybe I should add some error handling.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\ntry:\n\nwith open('filename.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n\ncontent = file.read()\n\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n\nprint(\"File not found.\")\n\nexcept PermissionError:\n\nprint(\"Permission denied.\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nprint(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n\n```\n\nThis way, I can catch specific exceptions and provide useful messages.\n\nNow, regarding the punctuation removal for words. I need to make sure that I'm not removing hyphens or apostrophes within words. For example, \"don't\" should be considered one word.\n\nSo, maybe instead of removing all punctuation, I can just remove the sentence-ending punctuation like '.', '?', and '!' from the end of words.\n\nAlternatively, I can keep the punctuation removal as is, assuming that words are separated by spaces and punctuation is not part of the word.\n\nBut to handle contractions and hyphenated words properly, maybe a better approach is to use the `split()` function and then strip punctuation from each word.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\n\nwords = content.split()\n\nnum_words = len(words)\n\n```\n\nAnd then, for sentences, use the regex split as planned.\n\nAlso, for paragraphs, split on '\\n\\n'.\n\nI should also consider that in some text files, paragraphs might be indented, but for simplicity, I'll assume that paragraphs are just separated by blank lines.\n\nNow, to test this, I need to create a sample text file with multiple paragraphs, sentences, and words, and see if my script counts them correctly.\n\nFor example, a text file like this:\n\n```\n\nThis is paragraph one. It has two sentences!\n\nThis is the second sentence of paragraph one?\n\nThis is paragraph two. It also has two sentences. The third sentence.\n\n```\n\nIn this case, there are two paragraphs, five sentences, and, let's count the words: \"This is paragraph one It has two sentences This is the second sentence of paragraph one This is paragraph two It also has two sentences The third sentence\" \u2014 that's 22 words.\n\nWait, maybe I should write a more precise count.\n\nLet me count again:\n\n- Paragraph one:\n\n- Sentence 1: \"This is paragraph one. It has two sentences!\"\n\n(6 words)\n\n- Sentence 2: \"This is the second sentence of paragraph one?\"\n\n(7 words)\n\n- Paragraph two:\n\n- Sentence 1: \"This is paragraph two. It also has two sentences.\"\n\n(7 words)\n\n- Sentence 2: \"The third sentence.\"\n\n(3 words)\n\nTotal words: 6 + 7 + 7 + 3 = 23 words\n\nSentences: 4\n\nParagraphs: 2\n\nWait, but according to my earlier plan, splitting on '\\n\\n' should give me two paragraphs, splitting on '.!?' should give me 4 sentences, and splitting on spaces and stripping punctuation should give me 23 words.\n\nSo, my script should output:\n\n- Words: 23\n\n- Sentences: 4\n\n- Paragraphs: 2\n\nNow, to implement this in code.\n\nI need to make sure that when splitting into sentences, I'm not counting empty strings. For example, if the text ends with a sentence-ending punctuation, splitting will result in an empty string at the end.\n\nSimilarly, when splitting paragraphs with '\\n\\n', I need to handle any trailing blank lines.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that in some text files, lines might end with '\\r\\n' instead of just '\\n', depending on the operating system.\n\nTo handle that, I can use the `universal newlines` feature of Python, which should handle different newline conventions.\n\nAlright, let's outline the steps again:\n\n1. Open the text file using `with open('filename.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:`\n\n2. Read the content with `content = file.read()`\n\n3. Count words:\n\n- Split the content into words using `words = content.split()`\n\n- Optionally, strip punctuation from each word, but for now, assume words are separated by spaces.\n\n- `num_words = len(words)`\n\n4. Count sentences:\n\n- Use `re.split(r'[.!?]', content)`\n\n- Count non-empty sentences: `num_sentences = len(sentences) - sentences.count('')`\n\n5. Count paragraphs:\n\n- Split the content into paragraphs using `paragraphs = content.split('\\n\\n')`\n\n- Remove any empty paragraphs: `num_paragraphs = len(paragraphs) - paragraphs.count('')`\n\n6. Print the counts:\n\n- `print(\"Words:\", num_words)`\n\n- `print(\"Sentences:\", num_sentences)`\n\n- `print(\"Paragraphs:\", num_paragraphs)`\n\nI should also consider that multiple spaces or tabs might be used in the text, so maybe replacing multiple whitespace characters with a single space would be beneficial.\n\nI can use `content = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', content)` to replace any sequence of whitespace characters with a single space.\n\nThis would help in splitting words correctly, even if there are multiple spaces or tabs between words.\n\nSimilarly, for paragraphs, I need to make sure that multiple blank lines are treated as a single paragraph separator.\n\nWait, but in text files, paragraphs are typically separated by one or more blank lines. So, splitting on '\\n\\n' should handle that, as splitting on '\\n\\n' will consider one or more blank lines as paragraph separators.\n\nBut to be safe, I can use `split('\\n\\n')` and then strip each paragraph to remove leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nWait, but counting paragraphs might be a bit tricky if there are multiple blank lines in a row.\n\nFor example, if there are two blank lines in a row, should that be considered as one paragraph separator or two?\n\nIn practice, multiple blank lines typically indicate separate paragraphs, so splitting on '\\n\\n' should work fine.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases:\n\n- A file with only one paragraph and no blank lines at the end.\n\n- A file with blank lines at the beginning or end.\n\n- A file with only one sentence.\n\n- A file with sentences that end with punctuation in the middle of a paragraph.\n\n- A file with no sentences, just words.\n\n- A file with only blank lines.\n\nI need to make sure that my script handles these cases correctly.\n\nFor example, if the file has only blank lines, there should be zero words, zero sentences, and zero paragraphs.\n\nIf the file has text but no sentence-ending punctuation, how should I count sentences? Maybe assume that there are no sentences if there are no '.', '?', or '!'.\n\nSimilarly, if there are words without any blank lines, there's only one paragraph.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered most of the aspects.\n\nLet me try writing a sample script based on this plan.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need a Python script that reads a text file and counts the number of words, sentences, and paragraphs. Sentences are delimited by periods, question marks, or exclamation points, and paragraphs are separated by blank lines.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading the File**: Use Python's `open` function to read the file content.\n2. **Counting Words**: Split the content into words based on spaces.\n3. **Counting Sentences**: Use regular expressions to split the content into sentences based on '.', '?', or '!'.\n4. **Counting Paragraphs**: Split the content into paragraphs based on blank lines ('\\\\n\\\\n').\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_words_sentences_paragraphs(filename):\n    try:\n        with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"File not found.\")\n        return\n    except PermissionError:\n        print(\"Permission denied.\")\n        return\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n        return\n\n    # Count words\n    words = content.split()\n    num_words = len(words)\n\n    # Count sentences\n    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]', content)\n    num_sentences = len(sentences) - sentences.count('')\n\n    # Count paragraphs\n    paragraphs = content.split('\\n\\n')\n    num_paragraphs = len(paragraphs) - paragraphs.count('')\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"Words:\", num_words)\n    print(\"Sentences:\", num_sentences)\n    print(\"Paragraphs:\", num_paragraphs)\n\n# Example usage:\n# count_words_sentences_paragraphs('sample.txt')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading the File**: The file is opened in read mode and its content is read into a variable.\n2. **Counting Words**: The content is split based on spaces to get words, and the number of words is counted.\n3. **Counting Sentences**: Regular expressions are used to split the content at each '.', '?', or '!', and the non-empty parts are counted as sentences.\n4. **Counting Paragraphs**: The content is split based on blank lines ('\\\\n\\\\n'), and the non-empty parts are counted as paragraphs.\n5. **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling for file not found, permission issues, and other exceptions."
