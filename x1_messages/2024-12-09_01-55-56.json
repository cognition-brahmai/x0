        "content": "So, let's see here. The car first travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then it speeds up to 80 miles per hour for another hour. I need to find out the total distance it travels.\n\nOkay, I remember that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, for the first part of the trip, the speed is 60 mph and the time is 2 hours. So, the distance for the first part should be 60 mph times 2 hours, which is 120 miles.\n\nThen, for the second part, the speed is 80 mph and the time is 1 hour. So, the distance for the second part is 80 mph times 1 hour, which is 80 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add those two distances together: 120 miles plus 80 miles equals 200 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to think about this? Maybe combining the speeds or something. But I think the straightforward way is just to calculate each part separately and then add them up.\n\nLet me double-check. If I were to try to calculate it differently, maybe find the average speed over the entire trip and then multiply by the total time. What would that look like?\n\nFirst, the total time is 2 hours plus 1 hour, which is 3 hours.\n\nNow, the average speed would be the total distance divided by the total time. But I don't know the total distance yet, because that's what I'm trying to find.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the best approach. Maybe I should stick with calculating each part separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of the harmonic mean of the speeds, but I don't think that's applicable here because the times spent at each speed are different.\n\nNo, I think the simplest and most accurate way is to calculate each segment separately and add them up.\n\nSo, first segment: 60 mph for 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\nSecond segment: 80 mph for 1 hour = 80 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 120 + 80 = 200 miles.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can visualize it or something.\n\nImagine a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is speed. For the first 2 hours, the speed is 60 mph, so it's a horizontal line at 60 for the first 2 hours. Then for the next hour, it jumps to 80 mph.\n\nThe distance traveled is the area under this speed-time graph.\n\nSo, for the first 2 hours, it's a rectangle with height 60 and width 2, so area is 120.\n\nFor the next hour, it's a rectangle with height 80 and width 1, so area is 80.\n\nTotal area, or total distance, is again 200 miles.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it in terms of equations, I could use the formula:\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nFor each segment, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst segment: d1 = 60 mph \u00d7 2 h = 120 miles\n\nSecond segment: d2 = 80 mph \u00d7 1 h = 80 miles\n\nTotal distance: d = d1 + d2 = 120 + 80 = 200 miles\n\nThat's consistent with the other methods I thought about.\n\nI don't think there's any need to overcomplicate this. The answer should be 200 miles.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I can consider if there's any other factor that might affect the total distance, like acceleration or something. But since the speeds are given as average speeds for each segment, I don't think I need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. Speed is in miles per hour and time is in hours, so multiplying them directly gives miles, which is what we want.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The total distance the car travels is 200 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
