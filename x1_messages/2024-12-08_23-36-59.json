        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a shipping company that needs to transport cargo containers from one port to another. Each container has a weight limit of 20 tons, and the ship's maximum capacity is 500 tons. The company charges $200 per ton for transportation, and if a customer ships more than 10 containers, they get a 10% discount on the total cost.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many containers can be shipped on the ship. Each container weighs up to 20 tons, and the ship can carry a maximum of 500 tons. So, the number of containers that can be shipped is the ship's capacity divided by the weight per container.\n\nNumber of containers = Ship's capacity / Weight per container\nNumber of containers = 500 tons / 20 tons per container\nNumber of containers = 25\n\nSo, the ship can carry up to 25 containers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total cost for a customer shipping 15 containers. Each container weighs 20 tons, and the cost is $200 per ton.\n\nFirst, find the total weight being shipped:\nTotal weight = Number of containers * Weight per container\nTotal weight = 15 containers * 20 tons per container\nTotal weight = 300 tons\n\nNow, calculate the total cost before any discount:\nTotal cost before discount = Total weight * Cost per ton\nTotal cost before discount = 300 tons * $200 per ton\nTotal cost before discount = $60,000\n\nSince the customer is shipping more than 10 containers, they get a 10% discount on the total cost.\n\nDiscount = 10% of total cost before discount\nDiscount = 0.10 * $60,000\nDiscount = $6,000\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to get the final total cost:\n\nTotal cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount\nTotal cost after discount = $60,000 - $6,000\nTotal cost after discount = $54,000\n\nSo, the total cost for shipping 15 containers is $54,000.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- The ship can carry up to 25 containers.\n\n- The total cost for shipping 15 containers, with a 10% discount, is $54,000.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
