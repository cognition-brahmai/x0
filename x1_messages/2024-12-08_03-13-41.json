        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, the edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. The operations allowed are insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character. This is also known as Levenshtein distance.\n\nTo solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can create a 2D array to store the distances between all prefixes of the two strings. Let's denote the two input strings as `str1` and `str2` with lengths `m` and `n` respectively. The DP table will have dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the edit distance between the first `i` characters of `str1` and the first `j` characters of `str2`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `dp[0][0] = 0` (empty strings have zero edit distance).\n   - For `i` from 1 to `m`, `dp[i][0] = i` (deleting `i` characters from `str1`).\n   - For `j` from 1 to `n`, `dp[0][j] = j` (inserting `j` characters into `str1`).\n\n2. **Filling the DP table**:\n   - For each `i` from 1 to `m` and for each `j` from 1 to `n`:\n     - If `str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` (no operation needed).\n     - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j],      // deletion\n                                     dp[i][j-1],      // insertion\n                                     dp[i-1][j-1])`   // substitution\n3. **Result**:\n   - The edit distance is found at `dp[m][n]`.\n\nNow, let's implement this in TypeScript.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the edit distance (also known as Levenshtein distance) between two strings using dynamic programming. The edit distance is the minimum number of operations (insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character) required to transform one string into the other.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings.\n   - Set `dp[0][0] = 0`.\n   - Initialize the first row and the first column of `dp` to represent the transformation of an empty string to the prefix of the other string, which corresponds to a series of insertions or deletions.\n\n2. **Filling the DP Table**:\n   - For each character in `str1` and `str2`, if the characters are the same, the cost is 0, and `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.\n   - If the characters are different, the cost is 1 for substitution, and we take the minimum of the three possible operations (deletion, insertion, substitution) plus one.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - The value at `dp[m][n]` will be the edit distance between the two strings.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```typescript\nfunction editDistance(str1: string, str2: string): number {\n    const m: number = str1.length;\n    const n: number = str2.length;\n    // Create a DP table\n    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));\n\n    // Initialize the first row and column\n    for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {\n        dp[i][0] = i; // Distance for deleting i characters from str1\n    }\n    for (let j = 0; j <= n; j++) {\n        dp[0][j] = j; // Distance for inserting j characters to str1\n    }\n\n    // Fill the DP table\n    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {\n        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n            if (str1[i - 1] === str2[j - 1]) {\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];\n            } else {\n                dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(\n                    dp[i - 1][j],    // Deletion\n                    dp[i][j - 1],    // Insertion\n                    dp[i - 1][j - 1] // Substitution\n                );\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return dp[m][n];\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)`. The first row represents the transformation of an empty string to prefixes of `str2` (through insertions), and the first column represents the transformation of prefixes of `str1` to an empty string (through deletions).\n- **Filling the DP Table**: For each pair of characters `str1[i-1]` and `str2[j-1]`, if they are the same, no operation is needed, so the distance remains the same as `dp[i-1][j-1]`. If they are different, we consider the minimum distance from deletion, insertion, or substitution operations.\n- **Result**: The value in `dp[m][n]` gives the edit distance between the entire strings `str1` and `str2`."
