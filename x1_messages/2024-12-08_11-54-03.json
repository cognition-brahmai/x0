        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of candy: type X costs $3 per pound, and type Y costs $5 per pound. The customer buys a total of 8 pounds for $28. We need to find out how many pounds of each type they bought.\n\nFirst, I think we should set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of pounds of type X candy.\n\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of pounds of type Y candy.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n\n1. The total weight of the candy is 8 pounds.\n\n2. The total cost of the candy is $28.\n\nSo, we can write two equations accordingly.\n\nThe first equation is about the total weight:\n\n\\[ x + y = 8 \\]\n\nThe second equation is about the total cost. Since type X costs $3 per pound and type Y costs $5 per pound, the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 3x + 5y = 28 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 8 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3x + 5y = 28 \\)\n\nI think the best way to solve this is using the substitution or elimination method. Let's try the substitution method first.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ x = 8 - y \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3(8 - y) + 5y = 28 \\]\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 24 - 3y + 5y = 28 \\]\n\n\\[ 24 + 2y = 28 \\]\n\n\\[ 2y = 28 - 24 \\]\n\n\\[ 2y = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 2 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( y = 2 \\), which means the customer bought 2 pounds of type Y candy, we can plug this back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x + 2 = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 8 - 2 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 6 pounds of type X candy and 2 pounds of type Y candy.\n\nLet's double-check to make sure this makes sense. If they bought 6 pounds of type X at $3 per pound, that's \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\) dollars. Plus 2 pounds of type Y at $5 per pound, which is \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) dollars. Adding those up: \\( 18 + 10 = 28 \\), which matches the total cost given in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the elimination method. Let's see how that works too, just for practice.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 8 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3x + 5y = 28 \\)\n\nLet's try to eliminate one of the variables. We can multiply the first equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 3(x + y) = 3(8) \\]\n\n\\[ 3x + 3y = 24 \\]\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1. \\( 3x + 3y = 24 \\)\n\n2. \\( 3x + 5y = 28 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[ (3x + 5y) - (3x + 3y) = 28 - 24 \\]\n\n\\[ 3x + 5y - 3x - 3y = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ 2y = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 2 \\]\n\nAgain, we find \\( y = 2 \\), and then \\( x = 6 \\) as before.\n\nSo, both methods give us the same answer: 6 pounds of type X and 2 pounds of type Y.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using ratios or something else, but I think the system of equations is the most straightforward method here.\n\nAnother thought: since the prices are $3 and $5 per pound, and the average cost per pound is \\( \\frac{28}{8} = 3.5 \\) dollars per pound, which is right in the middle of 3 and 5. That might suggest that the amounts of X and Y are equal, but in this case, it's 6 pounds of X and 2 pounds of Y, which isn't equal. Hmm, maybe that's not the best approach for this specific problem.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about the difference in cost. Type Y is $2 more per pound than type X. The total extra cost is \\( 28 - (8 \\times 3) = 28 - 24 = 4 \\) dollars. Since each pound of Y adds an extra $2, the number of pounds of Y would be \\( \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\) pounds, which matches our earlier result.\n\nThis is another quick way to verify the answer. If we have 2 pounds of Y, at $2 extra per pound, that's an extra $4, which, added to the cost of 8 pounds of X, gives us the total of $28.\n\nSo, all methods lead us to the same conclusion: the customer bought 6 pounds of type X candy and 2 pounds of type Y candy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\text{ pounds of type X and } 2 \\text{ pounds of type Y}} \\]"
