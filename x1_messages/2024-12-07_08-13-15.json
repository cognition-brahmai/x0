        "content": "To address the user's request to \"count the number of files with .txt extension,\" I need to select the most appropriate function from the provided options: image_processing, file_analytics, and csv_analytics. Given that the task involves files and specifically counting those with a .txt extension, the file_analytics function seems to be the most suitable choice.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **image_processing**: This function is designed for actions on images, such as resizing and cropping. It doesn't handle file counts or extensions, so it's not relevant for this task.\n\n2. **file_analytics**: This function is explicitly described as useful for performing operations on files, including counting and filtering based on file names and extensions. This directly aligns with the user's request to count .txt files.\n\n3. **csv_analytics**: This function is geared towards performing aggregations and counts on CSV data. While it can handle counts, it's focused on data within CSV files rather than the files themselves. Therefore, it's not the best fit for counting files based on their extensions.\n\nGiven that file_analytics is the most appropriate function, I need to specify the parameters correctly to achieve the desired outcome. The user wants to count files with a .txt extension, so I will set the action to \"count\" and use the filters to specify the file extension as \"txt.\"\n\nHere's the YAML-formatted response:\n\n```yaml\nfunction: file_analytics\nparams:\n  action: count\n  filters:\n    extension: txt\n```\n\nThis configuration instructs the file_analytics function to count the files that have the .txt extension, which should satisfy the user's request."
