It's indeed a staple in many casinos worldwide due to its simplicity and the strategic elements involved. The objective of the game is to have a hand value higher than the dealer's without exceeding 21. Players can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current hand) based on their strategy and the cards they've been dealt. Over the years, Blackjack has gained a significant following among both casual and professional gamblers, making it one of the most enduring casino games."
