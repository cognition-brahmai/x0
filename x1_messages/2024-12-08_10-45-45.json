        "content": "So I've got this problem here: a rectangular room has an area of 300 square feet and a width of 15 feet. I need to find out what the length of the room is. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, area equals length times width, or A = L \u00d7 W. In this case, the area A is 300 square feet, and the width W is 15 feet. I need to find the length L.\n\nSo, plugging in the values I have:\n\n300 = L \u00d7 15\n\nNow, to find L, I need to solve for L. I can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 15.\n\nSo, L = 300 \u00f7 15\n\nLet me do that division.\n\n300 divided by 15 is 20.\n\nSo, the length of the room is 20 feet.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Maybe I can use another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that area is equal to length times width, so if I have the area and one dimension, I can find the other dimension by dividing the area by that dimension.\n\nSo again, L = A \u00f7 W = 300 \u00f7 15 = 20 feet.\n\nOkay, that matches my first answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can visualize this. If the room is rectangular, and the width is 15 feet, and the area is 300 square feet, then the length should be such that when multiplied by 15, it gives 300.\n\nSo, 15 times what number equals 300? Well, 15 times 20 equals 300.\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using units to make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nThe area is in square feet, which is feet squared, and the width is in feet. So, when I divide area by width, I'm dividing feet squared by feet, which gives me feet.\n\nBecause (feet\u00b2) / feet = feet.\n\nSo, the units work out correctly, which is a good sign.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, I can plug the value back into the original equation to check.\n\nSo, A = L \u00d7 W = 20 \u00d7 15 = 300 square feet.\n\nYes, that matches the given area.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
