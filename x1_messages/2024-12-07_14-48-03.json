        "content": "Let's see. So, there's a car rental company with 120 cars in total, and the ratio of sedans to SUVs is 3:2. They want to change this ratio to 1:1 by purchasing more sedans. I need to find out how many more sedans they need to buy to achieve that.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many sedans and SUVs they currently have. The ratio is 3:2, which means for every 3 sedans, there are 2 SUVs. So, the total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, since there are 120 cars in total, each part of the ratio represents 120 / 5 = 24 cars.\n\nTherefore, the number of sedans is 3 parts \u00d7 24 = 72 sedans.\n\nAnd the number of SUVs is 2 parts \u00d7 24 = 48 SUVs.\n\nNow, they want to have a 1:1 ratio, meaning the number of sedans should be equal to the number of SUVs.\n\nCurrently, there are 72 sedans and 48 SUVs. To make the number of sedans equal to the number of SUVs, they need to have the same number of each.\n\nSince there are already more sedans than SUVs, they don't need to purchase more sedans to match the number of SUVs; in fact, they have more sedans already. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem says they need to purchase more sedans to make the ratio 1:1.\n\nLet me re-examine this.\n\nIf they have 72 sedans and 48 SUVs, and they want a 1:1 ratio, that means they need to have the same number of sedans and SUVs.\n\nBut if they purchase more sedans, the number of sedans will increase, while the number of SUVs remains the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the current situation.\n\nLet me double-check the initial calculation.\n\nTotal cars: 120\n\nRatio of sedans to SUVs: 3:2\n\nSo, sedans: (3/5) \u00d7 120 = 72\n\nSUVs: (2/5) \u00d7 120 = 48\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, to have a 1:1 ratio, the number of sedans should equal the number of SUVs.\n\nBut they have 72 sedans and 48 SUVs. If they purchase more sedans, the number of sedans will increase, which would make the ratio of sedans to SUVs even higher, not closer to 1:1.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. To achieve a 1:1 ratio, the number of sedans should be equal to the number of SUVs.\n\nSo, if they have 48 SUVs, they need to have 48 sedans to have a 1:1 ratio.\n\nBut they currently have 72 sedans, which is more than 48.\n\nSo, to have 48 sedans, they would need to reduce the number of sedans by 24.\n\nBut the problem says \"purchase more sedans,\" which implies buying additional sedans.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I misread the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is currently 3:2, meaning sedans to SUVs are in the ratio 3:2, so sedans are already more than SUVs.\n\nBut to make it 1:1, they need to make sedans equal to SUVs.\n\nGiven that they have more sedans already, to make sedans equal to SUVs, they would need to have the same number as SUVs, which is 48.\n\nSo, they have 72 sedans, need to have 48 sedans.\n\nThat means they need to remove 24 sedans.\n\nBut the question is about purchasing more sedans, which is contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is 3:2, but I need to find out how many more sedans to purchase to make it 1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that they will be adding more sedans, increasing the total number of cars.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s say they need to purchase x more sedans to make the ratio 1:1.\n\nSo, after purchasing x sedans, the total number of sedans will be 72 + x.\n\nThe number of SUVs remains 48.\n\nFor the ratio to be 1:1, the number of sedans should equal the number of SUVs.\n\nTherefore:\n\n72 + x = 48\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 48 - 72\n\nx = -24\n\nWait, that gives a negative value for x, which doesn't make sense in the context of purchasing (buying) more sedans.\n\nA negative value would imply selling sedans, not purchasing them.\n\nThis suggests that to achieve a 1:1 ratio, they need to sell 24 sedans, not purchase more.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"purchase more sedans,\" which seems contradictory to the result.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"If a car rental company has 120 cars in its fleet, and the ratio of sedans to SUVs is 3:2, how many more sedans does the company need to purchase to make the ratio 1:1?\"\n\nGiven that they have more sedans than SUVs already (72 sedans and 48 SUVs), to make the ratio 1:1, they need to have the same number of each.\n\nTherefore, they need to have 48 sedans, meaning they need to reduce the number of sedans by 24.\n\nBut the question is asking how many more sedans to purchase, which suggests increasing the number of sedans.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intends to ask how many more SUVs to purchase to make the ratio 1:1, but it specifically says sedans.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is interpreted differently.\n\nLet me consider the ratio of sedans to total cars.\n\nCurrent ratio of sedans to total cars is 72:120, which simplifies to 3:5.\n\nCurrent ratio of SUVs to total cars is 48:120, which is 2:5.\n\nBut the problem states the ratio of sedans to SUVs is 3:2, which I correctly interpreted earlier.\n\nThe problem is asking how many more sedans to purchase to make the ratio 1:1.\n\nBut based on the current numbers, purchasing more sedans would only increase the number of sedans beyond the number of SUVs, making the ratio more skewed towards sedans.\n\nTo make the ratio 1:1, the number of sedans needs to equal the number of SUVs.\n\nGiven that they have more sedans already, the only way to achieve a 1:1 ratio is to reduce the number of sedans or increase the number of SUVs.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"purchase more sedans,\" which seems counterintuitive.\n\nPerhaps there's a misinterpretation of the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be 1:1 of sedans to the total fleet.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me try setting up the equation again.\n\nLet x be the number of sedans to purchase.\n\nAfter purchasing x sedans, the total number of sedans will be 72 + x.\n\nThe number of SUVs remains 48.\n\nFor the ratio of sedans to SUVs to be 1:1,\n\n72 + x = 48\n\nSolving for x gives x = -24, which is not possible in the context of purchasing (buying) sedans.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to purchase more sedans to achieve a 1:1 ratio of sedans to SUVs because they already have more sedans than SUVs.\n\nTo make the ratio 1:1, they would need to either sell some sedans or purchase more SUVs.\n\nGiven the problem's wording, it seems there might be an error in the problem setup or interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is meant to be the ratio of SUVs to sedans, but that would still lead to the same conclusion.\n\nI think the correct interpretation is that they need to sell sedans or purchase SUVs to achieve a 1:1 ratio, but since the question specifies purchasing more sedans, it doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that it's not possible to purchase more sedans and achieve a 1:1 ratio of sedans to SUVs given the current fleet composition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
