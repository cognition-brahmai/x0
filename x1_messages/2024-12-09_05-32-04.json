        "content": "So, I've got this problem here: in a room with 30 people, what's the probability that at least two people share the same birthday? And it says to assume that each person's birthday is equally likely and to ignore leap years. Alright, let's try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, I know that there are 365 days in a year, right? Since we're ignoring leap years. So, each person can have a birthday on any of those 365 days, with equal probability.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability that at least two people share the same birthday. Hmm, \"at least two\" means that there's a minimum of two people sharing a birthday, but it could be more. That sounds a bit tricky because it could be two people, or three, or maybe even more in a room of 30.\n\nMaybe there's a better way to approach this. Sometimes, it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. What's the opposite of at least two people sharing a birthday? It would be that no one shares a birthday, meaning all 30 people have unique birthdays.\n\nSo, perhaps I can calculate the probability that all 30 people have different birthdays and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nThat sounds like a plan. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, consider the first person in the room. They can have a birthday on any of the 365 days. So, the probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365 out of 365, which is 1.\n\nNext, the second person. They need to have a birthday on a different day than the first person. Since the first person took one day, there are 364 days left. So, the probability for the second person is 364 out of 365.\n\nThen, the third person needs a birthday different from the first two. So, that's 363 days left out of 365.\n\nThis pattern continues until the 30th person, who would have 365 minus 29 = 336 days left, assuming all previous birthdays are unique.\n\nSo, the probability that all 30 people have unique birthdays is the product of these probabilities:\n\nP(all unique) = (365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365) * ... * (336/365)\n\nThat's a long multiplication. Maybe there's a better way to write this. I recall that this can be expressed using factorials or combinations, but let's see.\n\nThe numerator is 365 * 364 * 363 * ... * (365 - 29), which is 365! / (365 - 30)!\n\nAnd the denominator is 365^30, since each person's birthday is independent.\n\nSo, P(all unique) = (365! / (365 - 30)!) / 365^30\n\nThat's a bit messy, but perhaps we can compute it using a calculator or look for a simplification.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of something called the birthday paradox, which suggests that in a group of just 23 people, the probability of a shared birthday is already over 50%. So, with 30 people, it should be even higher.\n\nBut let's try to calculate it properly.\n\nMaybe I can calculate this step by step.\n\nStarting with P(all unique):\n\n= (365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365) * ... * (336/365)\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, (365/365) = 1\n\nThen, 1 * (364/365) \u2248 0.99726\n\nThen, 0.99726 * (363/365) \u2248 0.99180\n\nContinuing this way up to (336/365).\n\nThis is going to be time-consuming. Maybe there's a formula or a shortcut.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximation that P(all unique) \u2248 e^(-n(n-1)/(2*365)), where n is the number of people.\n\nBut let's see, for n=30, that would be e^(-30*29/(2*365)) = e^(-870/(730)) = e^(-1.1918), which is approximately 0.302.\n\nThen, P(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - 0.302 = 0.698, or 69.8%.\n\nThat seems high, but I think the birthday problem often surprises people with how high the probability is.\n\nBut maybe I should verify this with a more precise calculation.\n\nLet me try to calculate P(all unique) more accurately.\n\nP(all unique) = 365! / ( (365 - 30)! * 365^30 )\n\nCalculating factorials directly is impractical for large numbers, but maybe I can use a calculator or a computational tool to find this value.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula:\n\nP(all unique) = (365 choose 30) * (30! / 365^30)\n\nWait, \"365 choose 30\" is the number of ways to choose 30 unique birthdays out of 365, and 30! accounts for the permutations of those birthdays, divided by 365^30, which is the total number of possible birthday assignments.\n\nBut again, this seems complicated without a calculator.\n\nPerhaps I can look up the exact formula for the birthday problem.\n\nI recall that the probability of at least one shared birthday among n people is:\n\nP(n) = 1 - (365! / ( (365 - n)! * 365^n ))\n\nBut again, calculating factorials of large numbers like 365! is not practical manually.\n\nMaybe there's a simplification or a recursive formula.\n\nAlternatively, for small n relative to 365, the approximation P(n) \u2248 1 - e^(-n(n-1)/(2*365)) works fairly well.\n\nEarlier, using this approximation, I got P(n) \u2248 0.698 for n=30.\n\nBut perhaps I can find a more exact value using a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that the probability that the second person doesn't match the first is 364/365.\n\nThen, the probability that the third doesn't match the first two is 363/365.\n\nAnd so on, up to the 30th person having 336/365.\n\nSo, P(all unique) = (364/365) * (363/365) * ... * (336/365)\n\nThis is a decreasing sequence, so maybe I can approximate it using an integral or some other method, but that might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but that seems complicated for this problem.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way.\n\nI've seen tables for the birthday problem that give probabilities for different numbers of people.\n\nLet me see if I can recall or look up the probability for n=30.\n\nFrom what I remember, for n=23, P(n) is about 0.507, and for n=30, it's around 0.706.\n\nBut I should verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute P(all unique) numerically.\n\nLet's try calculating P(all unique) step by step for n=30.\n\nStart with P=1.\n\nThen, for each person from 2 to 30, multiply P by (365 - k + 1)/365, where k is the person number.\n\nSo, for k=2: P = 1 * (364/365) \u2248 0.99726\n\nk=3: P \u2248 0.99726 * (363/365) \u2248 0.99180\n\nk=4: P \u2248 0.99180 * (362/365) \u2248 0.98366\n\nk=5: P \u2248 0.98366 * (361/365) \u2248 0.97334\n\nk=6: P \u2248 0.97334 * (360/365) \u2248 0.96046\n\nk=7: P \u2248 0.96046 * (359/365) \u2248 0.94515\n\nk=8: P \u2248 0.94515 * (358/365) \u2248 0.92747\n\nk=9: P \u2248 0.92747 * (357/365) \u2248 0.90739\n\nk=10: P \u2248 0.90739 * (356/365) \u2248 0.88480\n\nk=11: P \u2248 0.88480 * (355/365) \u2248 0.85978\n\nk=12: P \u2248 0.85978 * (354/365) \u2248 0.83215\n\nk=13: P \u2248 0.83215 * (353/365) \u2248 0.80172\n\nk=14: P \u2248 0.80172 * (352/365) \u2248 0.76868\n\nk=15: P \u2248 0.76868 * (351/365) \u2248 0.73261\n\nk=16: P \u2248 0.73261 * (350/365) \u2248 0.69355\n\nk=17: P \u2248 0.69355 * (349/365) \u2248 0.65144\n\nk=18: P \u2248 0.65144 * (348/365) \u2248 0.60635\n\nk=19: P \u2248 0.60635 * (347/365) \u2248 0.55848\n\nk=20: P \u2248 0.55848 * (346/365) \u2248 0.50751\n\nk=21: P \u2248 0.50751 * (345/365) \u2248 0.45422\n\nk=22: P \u2248 0.45422 * (344/365) \u2248 0.40002\n\nk=23: P \u2248 0.40002 * (343/365) \u2248 0.34503\n\nk=24: P \u2248 0.34503 * (342/365) \u2248 0.29002\n\nk=25: P \u2248 0.29002 * (341/365) \u2248 0.23612\n\nk=26: P \u2248 0.23612 * (340/365) \u2248 0.18402\n\nk=27: P \u2248 0.18402 * (339/365) \u2248 0.13467\n\nk=28: P \u2248 0.13467 * (338/365) \u2248 0.08816\n\nk=29: P \u2248 0.08816 * (337/365) \u2248 0.04421\n\nk=30: P \u2248 0.04421 * (336/365) \u2248 0.02356\n\nSo, P(all unique) \u2248 0.02356\n\nTherefore, P(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - 0.02356 \u2248 0.97644, or 97.64%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems really high.

But earlier I thought it was too high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nLet me check against the approximation.\n\nUsing the approximation P(n) \u2248 1 - e^(-n(n-1)/(2*365)), for n=30:\n\nP(n) \u2248 1 - e^(-30*29/(2*365)) = 1 - e^(-870/730) = 1 - e^(-1.1918) \u2248 1 - 0.302 = 0.698, or 69.8%.\n\nBut earlier calculation gives approximately 97.6%, which is quite a difference.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy between the approximation and the exact calculation.\n\nI think the approximation is not accurate for larger n.\n\nMaybe I should look up the exact formula or verify my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approximate this.\n\nLet me consider that the probability of at least one collision is approximately n(n-1)/(2*365).\n\nFor n=30, that would be (30*29)/(2*365) = 870/730 \u2248 1.1918.\n\nBut since probabilities can't exceed 1, this approximation breaks down when n is large.\n\nThat's why it's better to use the exact formula.\n\nSo, going back to the exact calculation, P(all unique) = product from k=1 to 29 of (365 - k)/365.\n\nCalculating this product gives approximately 0.02356, as I did earlier.\n\nTherefore, P(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - 0.02356 \u2248 0.97644, or 97.64%.\n\nSo, in a room of 30 people, there's about a 97.6% chance that at least two people share the same birthday.\n\nThat's surprisingly high, but I guess that's the beauty of the birthday problem.\n\nIt shows how counterintuitive probabilities can be sometimes.\n\nSo, to summarize, the probability is approximately 97.6%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.970} \\]"
