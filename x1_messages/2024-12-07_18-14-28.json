        "content": "So, initially, there are five friends who decide to gift $200 equally among themselves. That means, at first, each friend was supposed to get an equal share of the $200.\n\nTo find out how much each friend would get initially, I would divide the total amount, which is $200, by the number of friends, which is five.\n\nSo, $200 divided by 5 equals $40 per friend.\n\nNow, later on, two of them back out. That means, out of the five friends, two are no longer participating in the gifting. So, the number of friends who are still going to receive the gift is five minus two, which is three friends.\n\nNow, the $200 needs to be distributed equally among these remaining three friends.\n\nTo find out how much each of the remaining friends gets now, I need to divide the total amount, $200, by the new number of friends, which is three.\n\nSo, $200 divided by 3 equals approximately $66.67 per friend.\n\nWait, but let's check that. Actually, $200 divided by 3 is exactly $66.666..., which is typically rounded to $66.67 when dealing with money.\n\nBut, to be precise in financial calculations, it's important to handle the division accurately. So, $200 divided by 3 is $66.666..., and in decimal form, it's $66.67 when rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nHowever, if we multiply $66.67 by 3, we get $199.99, which is one cent less than $200. This is a common issue with dividing amounts that don't divide evenly.\n\nTo handle this, one approach is to have one friend receive a slightly higher amount to make up for the difference. For example, two friends could receive $66.67, and one could receive $66.66, so that the total adds up to $200.\n\nBut in the context of the question, it seems like they want to know the equal share among the three remaining friends, assuming that the total $200 is to be distributed equally without considering the fractional cents issue.\n\nSo, in that case, each of the remaining three friends would get $200 divided by 3, which is approximately $66.67.\n\nBut to be more precise, perhaps it's better to express it as $66 and 2/3 cents, but since money is typically dealt in decimals to the hundredths place, $66.67 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to avoid the discrepancy, we could consider that two friends back out, so the $200 is to be divided among the remaining three friends.\n\nSo, $200 divided by 3 equals exactly $66.666..., which can be written as $66 and 2/3 cents.\n\nBut since we can't actually give a third of a cent, in practice, one friend might receive $66.66, and the other two receive $66.67, so that the total is $200.\n\nBut again, the question seems to be asking for the amount each of the remaining friends gets now, assuming equal distribution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately $66.67 per friend.\n\nWait, but let's think differently. Maybe the $200 was meant to be distributed equally among the five friends initially, but when two back out, the remaining three have to cover the same total amount, meaning they have to contribute more to make up for the two who backed out.\n\nWait, but that interpretation might not be correct because the way the question is phrased seems to suggest that the $200 is to be gifted among the friends, not that they are contributing to a pool.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Five friends decided to gift $200 equally among themselves. Later, two of them backed out. How much does each of the remaining friends get now?\"\n\nSo, it seems like the $200 is to be divided among the friends as a gift. Initially, it's five friends sharing $200 equally, which is $40 each.\n\nBut then two back out, meaning only three friends are left to receive the gift. So, the $200 is now divided among three friends.\n\nTherefore, each of the remaining three friends gets $200 divided by 3, which is approximately $66.67.\n\nBut, to address the discrepancy of the total not adding up to exactly $200 due to rounding, perhaps the exact amount is $66.666..., which can be expressed as $66 and 2/3 cents.\n\nHowever, since money is typically not divided into fractions smaller than a cent, in practice, the distribution would need to be adjusted slightly.\n\nFor example, one friend could receive $66.67, and the other two could receive $66.66, so that the total is $200.\n\nBut based on the question, it seems like they want the equal share, which is approximately $66.67 per friend.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the two friends who backed out forfeit their shares, then the remaining three friends get their original shares plus the shares of the two who backed out.\n\nInitially, each friend was to get $40. So, the two who backed out would have forfeited $40 each, totaling $80.\n\nTherefore, the remaining three friends now get their original $40 plus an additional $80 divided among them.\n\nSo, $80 divided by three is approximately $26.67 per friend.\n\nTherefore, each of the remaining three friends gets their original $40 plus $26.67, totaling approximately $66.67.\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we calculate it as $200 divided by 3, which is approximately $66.67, it's the same result.\n\nTherefore, each of the remaining friends gets approximately $66.67.\n\nBut to be precise, it's $66.666..., which is $66 and 2/3 cents.\n\nSince we can't actually give 2/3 of a cent, in practice, the amount would need to be rounded, with some friends receiving $66.67 and others $66.66 to make the total $200.\n\nBut in terms of the answer to the question, approximately $66.67 per friend is accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{66.\\overline{6}} \\]"
