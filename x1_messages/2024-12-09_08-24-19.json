        "content": "So I've got this problem here. A company makes widgets, and it costs them $2 to make each one. They sell each widget for $5. On top of that, they have fixed costs of $1,000 per month. The question is, how many widgets do they need to sell each month to break even?\n\nAlright, breaking even means that the total revenue equals the total costs. Total costs include both the fixed costs and the variable costs. Variable costs are the costs that change with the number of widgets produced, which in this case is $2 per widget. Revenue is the income from selling the widgets, which is $5 per widget.\n\nSo, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s let \\( x \\) represent the number of widgets sold.\n\nThe total cost (\\( TC \\)) would be the fixed costs plus the variable costs. So, \\( TC = 1000 + 2x \\).\n\nThe total revenue (\\( TR \\)) would be the selling price per widget times the number of widgets sold. So, \\( TR = 5x \\).\n\nTo break even, \\( TR = TC \\). Therefore, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n\\( 5x = 1000 + 2x \\)\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( x \\). First, I'll subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( 5x - 2x = 1000 + 2x - 2x \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 3x = 1000 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{1000}{3} \\)\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\n\\( x \u2248 333.333... \\)\n\nSince you can't sell a fraction of a widget, the company needs to sell at least 334 widgets to cover their costs.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If they sell 333 widgets:\n\nTotal cost: \\( 1000 + 2(333) = 1000 + 666 = 1666 \\)\n\nTotal revenue: \\( 5(333) = 1665 \\)\n\nThat's $1 short, so they haven't quite broken even yet.\n\nIf they sell 334 widgets:\n\nTotal cost: \\( 1000 + 2(334) = 1000 + 668 = 1668 \\)\n\nTotal revenue: \\( 5(334) = 1670 \\)\n\nNow, revenue is greater than cost, meaning they've broken even.\n\nSo, yeah, they need to sell at least 334 widgets per month to break even.\n\nAnother way to look at this is by using the concept of contribution margin. The contribution margin per widget is the selling price minus the variable cost per widget. So, that's \\( 5 - 2 = 3 \\) dollars per widget.\n\nTo cover the fixed costs of $1,000, you divide the fixed costs by the contribution margin per widget:\n\n\\( \\frac{1000}{3} \u2248 333.333... \\)\n\nAgain, since you can't sell a fraction of a widget, they need to sell 334 widgets to cover the fixed costs and break even.\n\nThis makes sense because each widget contributes $3 towards covering the fixed costs. So, $3 per widget times 334 widgets is \\( 3 \\times 334 = 1002 \\), which covers the $1,000 fixed costs and has $2 left over, meaning they've broken even and started making a profit.\n\nAlternatively, if they sell 333 widgets, the total contribution is \\( 3 \\times 333 = 999 \\), which is $1 short of the fixed costs, so they haven't quite broken even yet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 334 widgets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{334} \\]"
