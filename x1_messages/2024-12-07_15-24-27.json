        "content": "Whales have evolved a remarkable adaptation known as echolocation, which is particularly crucial for species like sperm whales that dwell in deep ocean environments where visibility is minimal. Echolocation allows whales to navigate and find prey by emitting clicking sounds and interpreting the echoes that bounce back from surrounding objects. This biological sonar system is so advanced that it enables whales to detect the size, shape, and even the internal structures of objects in their path, making it an indispensable tool for survival in the vast, dark expanses of the ocean."
