        "content": "So in this city, 60% of the population uses public transportation to get to work. The total population is 300,000 people. We need to find out how many people don't use public transportation for their daily commute.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 60% of 300,000 is, because that's the number of people who do use public transportation. Then, to find out how many don't use it, I can subtract that number from the total population.\n\nLet me calculate 60% of 300,000. Percentage means per hundred, so 60% is the same as 60 per 100 or 0.60 in decimal form. To find 60% of 300,000, I multiply 300,000 by 0.60.\n\n300,000 \u00d7 0.60 = 180,000.\n\nSo, 180,000 people use public transportation.\n\nNow, to find out how many don't use it, I subtract that number from the total population:\n\n300,000 - 180,000 = 120,000.\n\nTherefore, 120,000 people do not use public transportation for their daily commute.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can directly calculate the percentage of people who don't use public transportation.\n\nIf 60% use public transportation, then the remaining percentage doesn't use it. So, 100% - 60% = 40%.\n\nSo, 40% of the population doesn't use public transportation.\n\nNow, to find 40% of 300,000, I can multiply 300,000 by 0.40.\n\n300,000 \u00d7 0.40 = 120,000.\n\nAgain, I get 120,000 people who don't use public transportation.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign. It confirms that 120,000 is the correct number.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst method:\n\n- 60% of 300,000 is 180,000 (users of public transportation).\n\n- Total population minus users: 300,000 - 180,000 = 120,000.\n\nSecond method:\n\n- 40% of 300,000 is 120,000 (non-users of public transportation).\n\nBoth methods agree, so I'm confident with the answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using fractions instead of decimals.\n\n60% is the same as 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5.\n\nSo, 3/5 of the population uses public transportation.\n\nTherefore, the number of users is 3/5 \u00d7 300,000.\n\n3/5 \u00d7 300,000 = (3 \u00d7 300,000) / 5 = 900,000 / 5 = 180,000.\n\nAgain, the same number.\n\nSimilarly, 40% is 40/100, which is 2/5.\n\nSo, 2/5 of the population doesn't use public transportation.\n\n2/5 \u00d7 300,000 = (2 \u00d7 300,000) / 5 = 600,000 / 5 = 120,000.\n\nOnce more, I get 120,000.\n\nIt seems consistent across different methods.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for. For example, is there any possibility that some people might use other modes of transportation besides public transportation, but still not be included in the \"not using public transportation\" category? Wait, no. If they don't use public transportation, they're in the category of not using it, regardless of what other modes they use.\n\nSo, the answer should be straightforward: 120,000 people do not use public transportation for their daily commute.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if the question might be trickier than it seems. Maybe there's something about the way the data is presented that I'm missing. But it seems pretty straightforward: 60% use public transportation, so 40% don't, and 40% of 300,000 is 120,000.\n\nI think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120000} \\]"
