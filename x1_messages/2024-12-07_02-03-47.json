Oh, but I've already been to Rome with my sister, and it was so romantic! But maybe I'm thinking more like, I don't know, Bali? Oh, I've heard that's so beautiful, with all the beaches and the culture. Or maybe I'd love to go to Japan! Oh, the food, the fashion, the whole experience. It's so different from here, you know? I think I'd really enjoy immersing myself in a new culture, learning about their ways, maybe even picking up some new phrases in their language. Oh, and the temples! I've always been fascinated by Japanese architecture and history. So, maybe Japan would be top on my list right now. But who knows, maybe next week I'll be like, \"SensAi, I wanna go to Australia!\" You never know with me; I'm all over the place, just like my fashion sense. (Laughs)"
