        "content": "So there are 6 people in a room, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes happen in total. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that handshake is a mutual action between two people, so it's not like one person shaking hands multiple times with the same person. Each handshake involves two distinct individuals.\n\nLet me try to list out the handshakes to get a sense of it. Let's name the people: Alice (A), Bob (B), and then C, D, E, and F for the other four people.\n\nSo, Alice shakes hands with Bob, C, D, E, and F. That's 5 handshakes involving Alice.\n\nNext, Bob has already shaken hands with Alice, so he shakes hands with C, D, E, and F. That's 4 additional handshakes.\n\nThen, C has already shaken hands with Alice and Bob, so C shakes hands with D, E, and F. That's 3 more handshakes.\n\nNext, D has already shaken hands with Alice, Bob, and C, so D shakes hands with E and F. That's 2 more handshakes.\n\nFinally, E has already shaken hands with Alice, Bob, C, and D, so E shakes hands with F. That's 1 more handshake.\n\nAdding them up: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 handshakes in total.\n\nWait, is there a better way to calculate this without listing everything out? I remember something about combinations in math. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here because a handshake between Alice and Bob is the same as a handshake between Bob and Alice.\n\nSo, the number of handshakes should be equal to the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 6 to shake hands. That's a combination problem.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 (people), and k = 2 (since a handshake involves 2 people).\n\nSo, C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = (720) / (2 * 24) = 720 / 48 = 15.\n\nThat matches the total I got by listing them out.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of the formula for the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers, since each person shakes hands with (n-1) others, but we have to account for double counting because each handshake is counted twice in that approach.\n\nSo, if you have 6 people, the first shakes hands with 5, the next with 4, and so on, which is 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15.\n\nOr, using the formula for the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers:\n\nSum = (n-1) * n / 2\n\nBut in this case, it's (6 - 1) * 6 / 2 = 5 * 6 / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer: 15 handshakes.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any possibility that handshakes could be repeated or missed in this count?\n\nGiven that each pair of people shakes hands exactly once, and using the combination formula which inherently avoids duplicates, I think 15 is the correct answer.\n\nAdditionally, I can think about a smaller example to verify. Suppose there are 3 people: A, B, and C. The handshakes would be A-B, A-C, and B-C. That's 3 handshakes. Using the formula, C(3,2) = 3! / (2! * 1!) = 6 / 2 = 3. Correct.\n\nFor 4 people: A, B, C, D. Handshakes: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D. That's 6 handshakes. Using the formula, C(4,2) = 6. Correct again.\n\nSo, for 6 people, C(6,2) = 15 should be correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is 15 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
