I hope you have a wonderful Easter holiday. @ THIS HOUR with Berman and Michaela starts now. JOHN BERMAN, CNN CO-ANCHOR: It is a race against time in frigid waters, the capsized ferry now completely submerged, hundreds of children still missing and the captain who fled and survived is facing arrest. MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN CO-ANCHOR: Another day, another dive, could the fifth mission into the deep bring back a sign of Flight 370? BERMAN: In east Ukraine, masked men hand out anti-Semitic flyers outside a synagogue. U.S. officials describe the contents as grotesque and chilling. Who is behind them? And why? Hello, everyone. Great to see you. I\\'m John Berman. PEREIRA: And I\\'m Michaela Pereira. I thought you were going to start singing \"Together Again\" or something. BERMAN: It\\'s been a long time. PEREIRA: It\\'s been a long time. It\\'s 11:00 a.m. in the East, 8:00 a.m. out West. Those stories and much more, right now, @ THIS HOUR. BERMAN: We begin with divers racing to force their way into that sunken ferry. Its blue and white hull has slipped beneath the ocean\\'s surface. About 270 passengers, most of them teenagers, still missing. PEREIRA: CNN now has a transcript of the conversation between the ferry and the vessel traffic center. It begins at 8:55 a.m. Wednesday with the ferry\\'s distress call. BERMAN: This is the ferry. \"Please notify the coast guard, our ship is in danger. The ship is rolling right now.\" PEREIRA: There\\'s more back and forth, and a full five minutes later at 9:00 a.m., the ferry reports this. BERMAN: Again, this is the ferry. \"Currently the body of the ship is tilted to the left. Containers fell over, too.\" PEREIRA: The dispatcher then replies, \"OK, there are no damages to people?\" BERMAN: And the ferry, \"Currently it\\'s impossible to confirm. It is impossible to move as the body of the ship is tilted.\" PEREIRA: Then the traffic center replies, \"Yes, OK, please put on the life vests and get ready as people may have to abandon ship.\" Then, another five minutes later, the dispatcher reports, \"Yes, we just notified the coast guard.\" BERMAN: So that is a full 10 minutes before the traffic center confirms it notified the coast guard. That seems like an awfully long time. We\\'ll talk about that coming up. In the meantime, arrest warrants have been issued for the ferry\\'s captain and two other crew members after a prosecutor reveals it was a third mate at the helm when the ship started to sink. The captain was not in the steering room. PEREIRA: Now, as grief and anger deepen for passenger families, a fresh tragedy, the vice principal whose 300 students were on board the ferry was found hanging from a tree, just days after he was pulled from the wreckage. Our Paula Hancocks is in Jindo, South Korea. She joins us now. Paula, can you give us the latest on the search efforts right now? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, John and Michaela, we know they are continuing throughout the night. This, for the first time on Friday, we saw that divers did manage to get inside the submerged ship. Now, we know they managed to get into the second floor, at least part of it, but they were not able to get any further. But up until that point, they didn\\'t find any survivors and they didn\\'t find any bodies. But officials do say that they managed to pump some oxygen into the ship. Now the reasoning behind this is because they are working under the assumption that there are still survivors. At least that is what they said on Thursday. And they\\'re saying that if there are any air pockets within the ship, they want to make sure they are continuing to put oxygen into that area. But of course it is a very, very difficult situation. The weather conditions are not conducive to an easy search. We understand that the underwater currents are still strong. The winds are still high out at sea. It\\'s about 12 miles away from where we are now. John and Michaela? BERMAN: Paula, any sense of what caused this boat to go down? We\\'ve heard about a rapid right turn. We\\'ve heard about cargo shifting. Are they getting any closer to pinpointing a cause? HANCOCKS: Well, the latest we heard this Friday on -- from officials was that they almost downplayed the fact that there could have been a deviation from the intended route of this ferry, one official saying that they believe that this may not have been the sole cause, but of course we did hear on Thursday from maritime police they believe it could have contributed to this. So, at this point, it\\'s not clear what exactly did cause this. We do know, though, of course, the third officer was at the helm. The captain wasn\\'t at the helm. And the families here at the harbor are desperately trying to find out more information. This is the third night that they have been sitting at the water\\'s edge, looking out, wondering what has happened to their children. We are hearing one woman over and over, screaming at the top of her voice. We have heard her say, Just tell us, are they alive or dead? Are they alive or dead? And that is the basic question that officials cannot answer at this point. PEREIRA: An agonizing wait for those family members that are waiting onshore for any sign of their loved ones. Paula Hancocks, thank you very much for the very latest. We\\'ll continue to cover this story today. BERMAN: And, of course, talk about the apparent arrest warrant for the captain. Much more to come on this. But first, almost six weeks after Malaysian Flight 370 disappeared, this is what we know @ THIS HOUR. The Bluefin-21 is back in the deep, looking for clues on the ocean\\'s floor. This is its fifth dive. The first four have turned up nothing. PEREIRA: So far, this sub has gone it alone, but a Malaysian official says more unmanned subs could join the search later, this as frustrated relatives of the 239 people on board are turning up the heat on Malaysian officials. They\\'ve come up with a list, a list of 26 questions that they want answered at a meeting that is scheduled for next week in Beijing. BERMAN: We\\'ve been talking about the search under the sea. The search on the surface has not let up either. Almost two dozen ships and planes are eyeballing more than 20,000 square miles for any sign of debris. Let\\'s check in now with our Erin McLaughlin. She is in Perth in Australia, where this whole search is based. Good morning, Erin. What\\'s the latest? ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John. We know as of 9:00 a.m. local time, the Bluefin was in the water, some over 12 hours later, not clear if it has yet completed that fifth mission. Missions can take some 24 hours. We are learning more details about that fourth dive, which it completed last night. It was able to travel some 4.7 kilometers beneath the ocean\\'s surface, which is significant because it was previously thought that 4.5 kilometers was its depth capacity. And it\\'s important that it be able to travel deeper. It had to cut its first mission short, its very first mission short earlier due to depth concerns. But engineers analyzing the Bluefin-21 now say they believe it can go up to 5 kilometers deeper. So, it is significant that in practice now, it\\'s traveling those deeper depths, and it\\'s really important that it be able to really survey this entire area, because this is the search area that officials have identified as the most probable place that they will locate that black box based on ping analysis. As you mentioned, the first four dives so far turning up no clues as to the whereabouts of missing Malaysian Flight 370. We are waiting on the results from this fifth mission. PEREIRA: Actually, Erin, one of the things we\\'ve been hearing is there\\'s a lot of call for some extra assistance. We\\'ve heard that the Bluefin-21 might get help some more help with some other AUVs aiding in the search. Have you heard any further word on that? MCLAUGHLIN: That\\'s something we\\'re hearing from Malaysian officials, the acting transportation minister tweeting this morning that they\\'re exploring the possibility of introducing more submersibles to the search. But it\\'s not something at the moment we\\'re hearing from Australians. All along, they\\'ve said that they believe that the Bluefin-21 is capable of completing this phase of this search. Now, that being said, officials here in Australia saying that in the coming days they may wrap up this area that it\\'s currently looking at, which has been identified again as the most probable place based on those pings. Then they have to consider the next phases or next steps of this search. They may have to broaden it out a bit. And at that point it\\'s possible, one would imagine, that they would then introduce perhaps more submersibles to be able to cover more area. Michaela? PEREIRA: All right, Erin McLaughlin with the latest on that, thank you so very much. BERMAN: Let\\'s take a look at some of the other headlines @ THIS HOUR. This just in, a strong earthquake shook southern Mexico. This happened about a half an hour ago. The 7.5-magnitude quake, that\\'s big, struck along Mexico\\'s Pacific coast about 19 miles from the city of Tecpan. We have no word yet of damage or injuries. Stay with CNN. We\\'ll keep you updated as we get more details. PEREIRA: Some other headlines @ THIS HOUR, world leaders are denouncing shocking anti-Semitic leaflets that were handed out in eastern Ukraine, those leaflets ordering Jewish people in the area to register with the government office. They supposedly came from a man who calls himself the head of the \"People\\'s Republic of Donetsk,\" but he said he had nothing to do with them. We\\'ll have more details from the Ukraine later this hour. BERMAN: The deadliest accident ever on the world\\'s tallest mountain, an avalanche on Mount Everest has killed at least 12 Sherpa guides. Four others are missing and a high-altitude rescue operation under way right now. Officials in Nepal say this happened just above the base camp. That\\'s more than 20,000 feet up. The guides were preparing the path to the summit for climbers when the mountain of snow came crashing down. PEREIRA: People in Kansas City breathing quite a sigh of relief today, police took a man into custody in connection with as many as 20 highway shootings. Three people have been shot since early March. None of them suffered life-threatening wounds. A $10,000 reward was offered for information leading to an arrest, and now a man is in custody. BERMAN: Texas authorities have seized the ranch that was home to Warren Jeffs and his polygamist sect. The Yearning for Zion Ranch was big news in 2008 when police raided it and removed more than 400 children. Prosecutors and others it\\'s where Jeffs and other leaders sexually abused young girls by forcing them to marry older men. Jeffs is serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting two girls. One was just 12 years old. Just a handful of adults were still living at the 16,000-acre compound. PEREIRA: Ahead @ THIS HOUR, the last section of the South Korean ferry sinks underwater, could anyone still be alive down there? Our next guest says it\\'s possible if survivors have managed to find the voids.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 40 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION"

        "content": "Alright, so this is a pretty grim news segment, right? There's a lot going on here. First off, there's this ferry that capsized in South Korea, and it's really bad because hundreds of kids are missing. It's a school trip or something, right? So, that's really sad. They're trying to rescue people, but it's hard because the ferry is underwater, and the weather isn't great. There are questions about why the captain fled the ship, and now there are arrest warrants for him and some other crew members.\n\nThen, there's the ongoing mystery of Malaysian Flight 370. They've been searching for it for like six weeks now, and still, no definitive sign of where it is. They've got this underwater drone, the Bluefin-21, that's been diving down to look for signals, but so far, nothing. Families of the passengers are getting really frustrated and want answers from the Malaysian government.\n\nThere's also this alarming story about anti-Semitic leaflets being distributed in eastern Ukraine. It's really disturbing because it's essentially telling Jewish people to register with some government office, which sounds a lot like what happened in Nazi Germany. World leaders are condemning it, and it's adding to the tensions in that already volatile region.\n\nPlus, there was a massive avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 12 Sherpa guides. That's the deadliest accident in the mountain's history. It happened while they were preparing the path for climbers, which is really sad because these guides are essential for helping people reach the summit safely.\n\nAnd finally, some smaller stories: an earthquake in Mexico, some highway shootings in Kansas City that were solved, and the seizure of a polygamist ranch in Texas where the leader is serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting young girls.\n\nIt's a lot to take in, and it's pretty heavy stuff. It's important to stay informed, but sometimes, news like this can be really overwhelming.\n\n## Final Solution\nThis news segment covers multiple global events including the capsizing of a South Korean ferry with hundreds of missing children, the ongoing search for Malaysian Flight 370, anti-Semitic leaflets distributed in eastern Ukraine, a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest, highway shootings in Kansas City, and the seizure of a polygamist ranch in Texas. The segment highlights the urgency and complexity of these issues, emphasizing the need for continued attention and response from authorities and the public."
