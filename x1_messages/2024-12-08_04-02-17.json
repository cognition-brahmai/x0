        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to find out the volume of the cylindrical water tank and then determine how much water it contains when filled to 75% of its capacity.\n\nStarting with the volume of a cylinder, I recall that the formula is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nGiven that the diameter is 10 feet, the radius \\( r \\) is half of that, which is 5 feet. The height \\( h \\) is 12 feet. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi (5)^2 (12) \\]\n\\[ V = \\pi (25) (12) \\]\n\\[ V = 300\\pi \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nNow, since the tank is filled to 75% of its capacity, I need to find 75% of the total volume:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{filled}} = 0.75 \\times 300\\pi \\]\n\\[ V_{\\text{filled}} = 225\\pi \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, I need to convert this volume from cubic feet to gallons. I'm given that 1 cubic foot equals approximately 7.48 gallons. So:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225\\pi \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\( 225\\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 225\\pi \\approx 225 \\times 3.1416 = 706.86 \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nNow, multiplying by 7.48 gallons per cubic foot:\n\n\\[ 706.86 \\times 7.48 \\approx 5289.39 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nSo, the tank contains approximately 5289.39 gallons of water when filled to 75% of its capacity.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can be more precise without approximating \\( \\pi \\) too early in the calculation. Let's try to keep it in terms of \\( \\pi \\) until the final step.\n\nStarting again:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{filled}} = 225\\pi \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nConverting to gallons:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225\\pi \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nLet's compute \\( 225 \\times 7.48 \\) first:\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 7.48 = 1671 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 1671\\pi \\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\):\n\n\\[ 1671 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 5256.07 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nHmm, that's different from my previous calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in my first approach.\n\nLet me check my steps again. In the first method, I calculated \\( 225\\pi \\) as approximately 706.86 cubic feet, and then multiplied by 7.48 to get 5289.39 gallons. In the second method, I multiplied 225 by 7.48 to get 1671, then multiplied by \\( \\pi \\) to get approximately 5256.07 gallons.\n\nWhich one is correct? Let me verify the calculations.\n\nFirst method:\n\n\\[ 225\\pi \\approx 225 \\times 3.1416 = 706.86 \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\\[ 706.86 \\times 7.48 \\approx 5289.39 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nSecond method:\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 7.48 = 1671 \\]\n\\[ 1671 \\times \\pi \\approx 1671 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 5256.07 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. I think the mistake is in the first method. Let me recalculate \\( 225 \\times \\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 3.1416 = 706.86 \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nThen, multiplying by 7.48:\n\n\\[ 706.86 \\times 7.48 = 5289.39 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nBut according to the second method, it's:\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 7.48 = 1671 \\]\n\\[ 1671 \\times \\pi \\approx 1671 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 5256.07 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nWait a minute, I think I see the issue. The correct approach is to multiply the volume in cubic feet by the conversion factor to get gallons. So:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{filled}} = 225\\pi \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225\\pi \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nBut in the second method, I multiplied 225 by 7.48 first, which is actually incorrect because the \\( \\pi \\) should be multiplied with the 225 before multiplying by 7.48.\n\nLet me correct that. It should be:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{filled}} = 225\\pi \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225\\pi \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 225\\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 3.1416 = 706.86 \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 7.48:\n\n\\[ 706.86 \\times 7.48 = 5289.39 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225 \\times \\pi \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nBut in this case, it's best to calculate \\( 225\\pi \\) first and then multiply by 7.48.\n\nSo, the correct volume in gallons is approximately 5289.39 gallons.\n\nWait, but in the second method, I got 5256.07 gallons, which is different. I need to understand why there's a discrepancy.\n\nLet me recalculate the second method carefully:\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 7.48 = 1671 \\]\n\\[ 1671 \\times \\pi \\approx 1671 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 5256.07 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nBut according to the first method, it's 5289.39 gallons. There's a difference of about 33 gallons. That seems significant.\n\nI think the mistake is in the second method. Multiplying 225 by 7.48 first is not correct because the volume is \\( 225\\pi \\) cubic feet, and then multiplied by 7.48 to convert to gallons.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the conversion should be applied to the entire volume expression.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since \\( V_{\\text{filled}} = 225\\pi \\) cubic feet, and 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons, then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225\\pi \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 225\\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 3.1416 = 706.86 \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ 706.86 \\times 7.48 = 5289.39 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that \\( \\pi \\) is approximately 3.1416, then:\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 7.48 = 1671 \\]\n\\[ 1671 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 5256.07 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nWait, this is inconsistent. There's a mistake here. Let's think differently.\n\nActually, the correct calculation should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225\\pi \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 225 \\times 7.48 = 1671 \\), then multiply by \\( \\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 1671 \\times \\pi \\approx 1671 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 5256.07 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nAlternatively, calculate \\( 225\\pi \\times 7.48 \\):\n\n\\[ 225\\pi \\approx 706.86 \\]\n\\[ 706.86 \\times 7.48 \\approx 5289.39 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nThere's a discrepancy because in one method, I'm multiplying 225 by \\( \\pi \\) first, and then by 7.48, while in the other, I'm multiplying 225 by 7.48 first and then by \\( \\pi \\). Mathematically, multiplication is associative, so both should give the same result. However, due to rounding errors in approximating \\( \\pi \\), the results differ slightly.\n\nTo get a more accurate result, it's better to perform the multiplications in a way that minimizes rounding errors. Let's try calculating it step by step with more decimal places.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 225\\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 3.1415926535 = 706.858389975 \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nThen, convert to gallons:\n\n\\[ 706.858389975 \\times 7.48 = 5289.25041688 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nAlternatively, calculate \\( 225 \\times 7.48 = 1671 \\), then multiply by \\( \\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 1671 \\times 3.1415926535 = 5256.045797185 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nThere's still a difference because of the approximation of \\( \\pi \\). To get the most accurate result, it's better to perform the calculations using the exact value of \\( \\pi \\) as much as possible.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate it as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225\\pi \\times 7.48 = 225 \\times 7.48 \\times \\pi = 1671\\pi \\]\n\nUsing \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1415926535 \\):\n\n\\[ 1671 \\times 3.1415926535 \\approx 5256.045797185 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nBut earlier, I got 5289.25041688 gallons with the other method. There's a discrepancy of about 33 gallons, which is likely due to rounding errors.\n\nTo resolve this, perhaps I should use a more precise value for \\( \\pi \\) in both calculations.\n\nLet's try with more decimal places:\n\nFirst method:\n\n\\[ 225 \\times \\pi \\approx 225 \\times 3.141592653589793 = 706.858389977 \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\\[ 706.858389977 \\times 7.48 \\approx 5289.25041688 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nSecond method:\n\n\\[ 225 \\times 7.48 = 1671 \\]\n\\[ 1671 \\times \\pi \\approx 1671 \\times 3.141592653589793 = 5256.045797185 \\ \\text{gallons} \\]\n\nThe discrepancy persists, suggesting that there's a fundamental error in one of the approaches.\n\nUpon reflection, I realize that the second method is incorrect because it separates the multiplication in a way that doesn't accurately represent the volume calculation.\n\nThe correct approach is the first method:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{filled}} = 225\\pi \\ \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225\\pi \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 225\\pi \\) first and then multiplying by 7.48 gives a more accurate result because it directly converts the volume from cubic feet to gallons after calculating the volume in cubic feet.\n\nTherefore, the correct volume in gallons is approximately 5289.25 gallons.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid rounding errors, I can calculate it as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume in gallons} = 225 \\times \\pi \\times 7.48 \\]\n\nUsing the exact value of \\( \\pi \\), but since we're dealing with approximations in measurements, using \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1416 \\) is sufficient for practical purposes.\n\nSo, the tank contains approximately 5289.25 gallons of water when filled to 75% of its capacity.\n\nBut to present a final answer, I should round it to a reasonable number of decimal places. Since the conversion factor is given to two decimal places, rounding to the nearest gallon would be appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the tank contains approximately 5289 gallons of water when filled to 75% of its capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5289 \\ \\text{gallons}} \\]"
