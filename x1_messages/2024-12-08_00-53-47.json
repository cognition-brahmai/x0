Quicksort is a very efficient sorting algorithm, and it's great to learn about it.\n\nFirst, I'll explain how quicksort works so you understand the code better. Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This continues until the sub-arrays are small enough to be considered sorted, typically when they have one or zero elements.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Choose a pivot**: This can be any element in the array. Common choices are the first element, the last element, or the middle element. For simplicity, we'll choose the last element as the pivot.\n\n2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final sorted position.\n\n3. **Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and to the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.**\n\nNow, let's look at the Python code that implements this algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    else:\n        pivot = arr[-1]  # Choosing the last element as the pivot\n        less = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x <= pivot]\n        greater = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > pivot]\n        return quicksort(less) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sample_list = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]\n    sorted_list = quicksort(sample_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the list has one or zero elements, it's already sorted, so we return it as is.\n\n2. **Choosing the Pivot**: We select the last element of the list as the pivot.\n\n3. **Partitioning**:\n   - We create two lists: `less` for elements less than or equal to the pivot, and `greater` for elements greater than the pivot.\n   - We use list comprehensions to populate these lists from the original array, excluding the pivot.\n\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: We recursively sort the `less` and `greater` lists and combine them with the pivot in between to get the final sorted list.\n\nThis implementation is straightforward and easy to understand. However, it's not the most efficient because it creates new lists for the partitioning step. For larger lists, an in-place partitioning method would be more efficient, but it's also more complex.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
