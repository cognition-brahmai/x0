        "content": "So I've got this problem here about a car driving at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to find out the total distance it travels. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the car drives at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 2 hours. Then, it drives at an average speed of 70 miles per hour for another 3 hours. I need to find the total distance traveled.\n\nI remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for the first part, the distance should be 50 mph times 2 hours, which is 100 miles. For the second part, it's 70 mph times 3 hours, which is 210 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just need to add those two distances together: 100 miles plus 210 miles equals 310 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there something else I need to consider? Like, is the car changing speed gradually or something? The problem says it's driving at an average speed, so I think it's fine to use the formula distance equals speed multiplied by time for each segment.\n\nLet me double-check. Average speed is indeed the total distance divided by the total time, but in this case, since they're giving me the average speed for each segment separately, I can calculate each segment's distance separately and then add them up.\n\nSo, first segment: 50 mph for 2 hours = 100 miles.\n\nSecond segment: 70 mph for 3 hours = 210 miles.\n\nTotal distance: 100 + 210 = 310 miles.\n\nI think that's the answer. But maybe I should consider if there's any resting time or something, but the problem doesn't mention any breaks, so I don't think that's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the average speed for the entire trip. But no, the question specifically asks for the total distance traveled.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula that incorporates both speeds and times together.\n\nSo, total distance is the sum of the distances of each segment, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the average speed for the entire trip, I would need to divide the total distance by the total time.\n\nBut again, the question is only asking for the total distance, so I don't need to calculate the average speed.\n\nTherefore, the total distance traveled is 310 miles.\n\nI think that's straightforward. No need to overcomplicate it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{310} \\]"
