        "content": "I'm not sure what you mean. A whirlpool is a powerful circular current of water, usually caused by opposing tides. Jumping into one can be dangerous because the force of the water can pull you under and make it hard to swim back to the surface. Shouting out a time period wouldn't have any effect on the whirlpool or your situation. It's important to stay safe around strong water currents and avoid jumping into whirlpools."
