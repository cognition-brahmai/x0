        "content": "So the car travels 150 miles in 3 hours, and we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 100 miles if it keeps the same speed. Okay, first things first, I need to figure out the car's speed.\n\nSpeed is usually calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it takes to travel that distance. So, speed equals distance divided by time. In this case, the car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. So, speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.\n\nNow that I know the car's speed is 50 miles per hour, I can use that to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 100 miles. Time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time = 100 miles / 50 miles per hour = 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take the car 2 hours to travel the additional 100 miles if it maintains the same speed.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If the car is going 50 miles per hour, then in one hour it travels 50 miles. So, for 100 miles, it should take 2 hours. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion. If 150 miles takes 3 hours, then 100 miles will take x hours. So, 150/3 = 100/x. Solving for x, I get x = (100 * 3) / 150 = 300 / 150 = 2 hours. Same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which way I look at it, the answer is 2 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 \\text{ hours}} \\]"
