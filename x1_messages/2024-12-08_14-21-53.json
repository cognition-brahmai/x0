        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here. There's a group of people, and they're divided into vegetarians and non-vegetarians. 40% are vegetarians and 60% are non-vegetarians. Then, among the vegetarians, 25% eat eggs, and among the non-vegetarians, 50% eat eggs. I need to find out what percentage of the total group eats eggs.\n\nOkay, first, I should probably figure out how many people in each category eat eggs and then add those up to get the total percentage.\n\nSo, starting with the vegetarians: 40% of the group are vegetarians, and 25% of those vegetarians eat eggs. So, to find out what percentage of the total group that is, I can multiply 40% by 25%.\n\nLet me calculate that: 40% times 25% is... well, 40% is 0.4, and 25% is 0.25. So, 0.4 times 0.25 is 0.1, which is 10%.\n\nAlright, so 10% of the total group are vegetarians who eat eggs.\n\nNow, for the non-vegetarians: 60% of the group are non-vegetarians, and 50% of those eat eggs. So, again, I'll multiply 60% by 50% to find out what percentage of the total group that represents.\n\n60% is 0.6, and 50% is 0.5. So, 0.6 times 0.5 is 0.3, which is 30%.\n\nSo, 30% of the total group are non-vegetarians who eat eggs.\n\nNow, to find the total percentage of the group that eats eggs, I just need to add those two amounts together: 10% plus 30% equals 40%.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing here?\n\nLet me double-check. The problem says that among vegetarians, 25% eat eggs, and among non-vegetarians, 50% eat eggs. And I've calculated that 10% of the total are vegetarians who eat eggs, and 30% are non-vegetarians who eat eggs. Adding up to 40%.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be sure, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nLet's assume there are 100 people in the group for simplicity.\n\nSo, 40% are vegetarians: 40 people.\n\n60% are non-vegetarians: 60 people.\n\nAmong the vegetarians, 25% eat eggs: 25% of 40 is 10 people.\n\nAmong the non-vegetarians, 50% eat eggs: 50% of 60 is 30 people.\n\nSo, total number of people who eat eggs is 10 plus 30, which is 40 people.\n\nTherefore, 40% of the total group eats eggs.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation. I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using probabilities or something like that?\n\nLet me think. The total probability of someone eating eggs would be the sum of the probabilities of being a vegetarian and eating eggs plus the probability of being a non-vegetarian and eating eggs.\n\nSo, P(eats eggs) = P(vegetarian) * P(eats eggs | vegetarian) + P(non-vegetarian) * P(eats eggs | non-vegetarian)\n\nPlugging in the values: P(eats eggs) = 0.4 * 0.25 + 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.1 + 0.3 = 0.4, or 40%.\n\nOkay, so all methods lead to the same conclusion. It seems consistent.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here. The answer should be 40%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40\\%} \\]"
