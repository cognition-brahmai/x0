        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a factory that produces widgets in batches of 25. Each day, they produce twice as many batches as the day before, and on Monday, they started with 2 batches. We need to find out how many widgets they produced from Monday to Friday inclusive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pattern of batch production. It says that every day they produce twice as many batches as the previous day, and they started with 2 batches on Monday. So, let's list out the number of batches produced each day from Monday to Friday.\n\n- Monday: 2 batches\n\n- Tuesday: twice Monday, so 2 * 2 = 4 batches\n\n- Wednesday: twice Tuesday, so 4 * 2 = 8 batches\n\n- Thursday: twice Wednesday, so 8 * 2 = 16 batches\n\n- Friday: twice Thursday, so 16 * 2 = 32 batches\n\nNow, I have the number of batches for each day. Since each batch contains 25 widgets, I need to calculate the number of widgets for each day by multiplying the number of batches by 25.\n\nLet's do that:\n\n- Monday: 2 batches * 25 = 50 widgets\n\n- Tuesday: 4 batches * 25 = 100 widgets\n\n- Wednesday: 8 batches * 25 = 200 widgets\n\n- Thursday: 16 batches * 25 = 400 widgets\n\n- Friday: 32 batches * 25 = 800 widgets\n\nNow, to find the total number of widgets produced from Monday to Friday, I need to add up all these daily productions.\n\nTotal widgets = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday\n\nTotal widgets = 50 + 100 + 200 + 400 + 800\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n50 + 100 = 150\n\n150 + 200 = 350\n\n350 + 400 = 750\n\n750 + 800 = 1550\n\nSo, the total number of widgets produced from Monday to Friday is 1550.\n\nWait a minute, is there a smarter way to calculate this without adding each day's production separately? Since the number of batches is doubling every day, this seems like a geometric sequence.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. Here, the common ratio is 2.\n\nThe sum of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nWhere:\n\n- a is the first term\n\n- r is the common ratio\n\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- a = 2 batches (Monday)\n\n- r = 2 (doubling each day)\n\n- n = 5 days (Monday to Friday)\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of batches produced from Monday to Friday.\n\nTotal batches = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32\n\nUsing the geometric series sum formula:\n\nTotal batches = 2 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2 * (32 - 1) / 1 = 2 * 31 = 62 batches\n\nNow, since each batch is 25 widgets, total widgets = 62 batches * 25 widgets/batch = 1550 widgets\n\nThis matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have considered the widget production directly as a geometric sequence where each day's production is twice the previous day's production, but since the batch size is constant, it's simpler to calculate batches first and then convert to widgets.\n\nWait, but actually, the production is in batches, and each batch is 25 widgets, so calculating batches first makes sense.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any mistake in this approach.\n\nStarting with 2 batches on Monday, doubling each day:\n\n- Monday: 2 batches\n\n- Tuesday: 4 batches\n\n- Wednesday: 8 batches\n\n- Thursday: 16 batches\n\n- Friday: 32 batches\n\nTotal batches: 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62 batches\n\nEach batch is 25 widgets, so 62 * 25 = 1550 widgets\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the widget production directly:\n\n- Monday: 2 * 25 = 50 widgets\n\n- Tuesday: 4 * 25 = 100 widgets\n\n- Wednesday: 8 * 25 = 200 widgets\n\n- Thursday: 16 * 25 = 400 widgets\n\n- Friday: 32 * 25 = 800 widgets\n\nTotal: 50 + 100 + 200 + 400 + 800 = 1550 widgets\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the widget production as a geometric sequence where each day's production is twice the previous day's production, but starting with 50 widgets on Monday.\n\nSo, first term a = 50 widgets\n\nCommon ratio r = 2\n\nNumber of terms n = 5\n\nSum = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1) = 50 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 50 * (32 - 1) / 1 = 50 * 31 = 1550 widgets\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which method I use, I end up with 1550 widgets.\n\nTherefore, the total number of widgets produced from Monday to Friday is 1550.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1550} \\]"
