        "content": "So I have this problem: \"What is the sum of all the integers between 100 and 200 that are divisible by 7?\" Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find all the integers between 100 and 200 that are divisible by 7 and then add them up. So, the numbers I'm interested in are those that when divided by 7 give a whole number, no decimals.\n\nMaybe I can start by finding the smallest number greater than 100 that is divisible by 7. Let's see, 100 divided by 7 is approximately 14.2857, so the next whole number is 15. So, 7 times 15 is 105. That seems like the smallest number above 100 that's divisible by 7.\n\nNow, what's the largest number below 200 that's divisible by 7? 200 divided by 7 is about 28.5714, so the whole number part is 28. 7 times 28 is 196. So, 196 is the largest number below 200 that's divisible by 7.\n\nAlright, now I need to find all the multiples of 7 from 105 to 196 inclusive and sum them up.\n\nI recall that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:\n\nSum = (Number of terms) \u00d7 (First term + Last term) / 2\n\nSo, in this case, the first term is 105, the last term is 196, and the common difference is 7 since we're dealing with multiples of 7.\n\nFirst, I need to find the number of terms. How many multiples of 7 are there from 105 to 196?\n\nWell, the first term is 105, which is 7 \u00d7 15, and the last term is 196, which is 7 \u00d7 28. So, the number of terms is 28 - 15 + 1 = 14.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\nNumber of terms = (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nNumber of terms = (196 - 105) / 7 + 1 = (91) / 7 + 1 = 13 + 1 = 14\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, using the sum formula:\n\nSum = 14 \u00d7 (105 + 196) / 2 = 14 \u00d7 (301) / 2 = 14 \u00d7 150.5\n\nWait, but 301 divided by 2 is 150.5, and 14 times 150.5 seems a bit tricky to calculate mentally. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since all these numbers are multiples of 7, I can factor out the 7.\n\nSo, the sum is 7 \u00d7 (15 + 16 + 17 + ... + 28)\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the integers from 15 to 28 inclusive.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series again:\n\nSum = (Number of terms) \u00d7 (First term + Last term) / 2\n\nNumber of terms from 15 to 28: 28 - 15 + 1 = 14\n\nSum = 14 \u00d7 (15 + 28) / 2 = 14 \u00d7 43 / 2 = 14 \u00d7 21.5 = 301\n\nThen, the total sum is 7 \u00d7 301 = 2107\n\nWait, but earlier I had 14 \u00d7 150.5 = 2107, which matches this result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series directly with the first term, last term, and number of terms.\n\nSum = n/2 \u00d7 (a + l)\n\nWhere n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n\nSo, Sum = 14/2 \u00d7 (105 + 196) = 7 \u00d7 301 = 2107\n\nYes, that's the same answer.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe by finding the sum of all multiples of 7 up to 200 and subtracting the sum of all multiples of 7 up to 100.\n\nFirst, find the sum of multiples of 7 up to 200.\n\nThe largest multiple of 7 below 200 is 196, which is 7 \u00d7 28.\n\nSum = 28 \u00d7 (28 + 1) / 2 \u00d7 7 = 28 \u00d7 29 / 2 \u00d7 7 = (28 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 7) / 2\n\nCalculate 28 \u00d7 29 = 812\n\n812 \u00d7 7 = 5684\n\n5684 / 2 = 2842\n\nSo, the sum of multiples of 7 up to 200 is 2842.\n\nNow, sum of multiples of 7 up to 100.\n\nThe largest multiple of 7 below 100 is 98, which is 7 \u00d7 14.\n\nSum = 14 \u00d7 (14 + 1) / 2 \u00d7 7 = 14 \u00d7 15 / 2 \u00d7 7 = (14 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 7) / 2\n\n14 \u00d7 15 = 210\n\n210 \u00d7 7 = 1470\n\n1470 / 2 = 735\n\nSo, the sum of multiples of 7 up to 100 is 735.\n\nNow, subtract the two sums to get the sum from 105 to 196.\n\n2842 - 735 = 2107\n\nAgain, the same answer, 2107.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is 105, the common difference is 7, and the number of terms is 14.\n\nSum = n/2 \u00d7 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nWhere n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nSum = 14/2 \u00d7 [2\u00d7105 + (14-1)\u00d77] = 7 \u00d7 [210 + 13\u00d77] = 7 \u00d7 [210 + 91] = 7 \u00d7 301 = 2107\n\nOnce again, 2107.\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so the sum should be 2107.\n\nLet me just double-check one more time. Maybe by listing out the terms and adding them manually, but that might be time-consuming for 14 terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of multiples of a number within a range.\n\nBut since I've got consistent results from multiple methods, I'm confident that 2107 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2107} \\]"
