        "content": "Let's see. So, the store has a deal where if you buy 3 items, you get a 20% discount on the total price. Each item costs $50, and I want to know how much I would pay for 9 items.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the discount. It says that buying 3 items gives a 20% discount on the total price. So, for 3 items, the regular price would be 3 times $50, which is $150. With a 20% discount, I would save 20% of $150.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n20% of $150 is (20/100) * 150 = 0.2 * 150 = $30.\n\nSo, the discount is $30, meaning I pay $150 - $30 = $120 for 3 items.\n\nNow, I want to buy 9 items. Since 9 is a multiple of 3, I can think of it as buying three sets of 3 items.\n\nSo, for each set of 3 items, I pay $120.\n\nTherefore, for 9 items, it should be 3 times $120, which is $360.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to look at this? Maybe I should consider the discount per item.\n\nIf 3 items cost $120, then each item in that set costs $120 / 3 = $40.\n\nSo, effectively, each item is being sold at $40 after the discount.\n\nIf I buy 9 items, and each is $40, then total cost is 9 * $40 = $360.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's a better deal or if there are any other discounts for buying more items.\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any additional discounts for buying more than 3 items, beyond the 20% discount per set of 3 items.\n\nSo, I think $360 is the correct total to pay for 9 items.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]"
