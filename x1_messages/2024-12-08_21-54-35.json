        "content": "So I have this problem here: there are 8 ounces in a cup, and I have a container that holds 5 cups of water. I need to find out how many ounces of water the container holds. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between ounces and cups. The problem states that there are 8 ounces in one cup. So, if I have one cup, that's 8 ounces. Now, if I have 5 cups, I should be able to multiply the number of cups by the number of ounces per cup to get the total ounces.\n\nSo, the calculation should be: 5 cups \u00d7 8 ounces per cup.\n\nLet me do the math: 5 times 8 is 40. So, the container holds 40 ounces of water.\n\nWait a minute, is that too straightforward? Maybe I should double-check. Let's see, if 1 cup is 8 ounces, then 5 cups would be 5 times that amount. Yes, that's correct. Another way to think about it is to add 8 ounces five times: 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 equals 40 ounces.\n\nAlternatively, I could use division, but that doesn't make sense in this context because I'm scaling up from cups to ounces, which requires multiplication.\n\nIs there any other way to verify this? Well, I know that in the US customary system, 8 ounces equal one cup, and there are 16 ounces in a pound, but that's not relevant here. I just need to convert cups to ounces.\n\nSo, to summarize, 5 cups times 8 ounces per cup equals 40 ounces.\n\nI think that's the answer. Simple yet straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]\n"
