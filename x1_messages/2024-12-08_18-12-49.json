        "content": "So, the train travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and it takes 2 hours to go from Town A to Town B. We need to find out how far apart these two towns are.\n\nWell, I remember that when we talk about speed, time, and distance, there's a formula that connects them. The formula is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 60 miles per hour, and the time is 2 hours. So, if I plug these values into the formula, it should give me the distance between the towns.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours\n\nNow, when I multiply these, the 'hours' unit in the denominator of the speed and the 'hours' unit in the time will cancel each other out, leaving me with miles.\n\nSo, Distance = 60 \u00d7 2 = 120 miles\n\nTherefore, Town A and Town B are 120 miles apart.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should think about it differently. If the train is going 60 miles per hour, that means it covers 60 miles every hour. So, in 2 hours, it would cover 60 miles + 60 miles, which is 120 miles. Yeah, that matches what I got from the formula.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time, I could rearrange that to find distance: distance equals speed times time. Again, that's the same as before.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. Town A and Town B are 120 miles apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
