        "content": "Existentialism most directly challenges Rationalism. Rationalism is a philosophical school that emphasizes reason and intellect as the primary sources of knowledge and truth. Existentialists, on the other hand, focus on individual experience, emotion, and subjective interpretation of reality. They argue that universal truths and objective reality are less important than personal experience and individual choice."
