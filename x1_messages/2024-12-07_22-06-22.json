        "content": "Let's see. There are 3 doctors in this town, and each has exactly 4 patients who visit them every day. So, initially, it's like:\n\n- Doctor A: 4 patients\n\n- Doctor B: 4 patients\n\n- Doctor C: 4 patients\n\nNow, one of the doctors gets sick and can't see any patients. Let's say Doctor C is the one who's sick. So, Doctor C's 4 patients need to be taken care of by the other two doctors, Doctor A and Doctor B.\n\nThey decide to split Doctor C's patients evenly between them. Since there are 4 patients and 2 doctors, each of the remaining doctors will take 2 of Doctor C's patients.\n\nSo, Doctor A will now have his original 4 patients plus 2 from Doctor C, making a total of 6 patients.\n\nSimilarly, Doctor B will have his original 4 patients plus 2 from Doctor C, also making a total of 6 patients.\n\nAnd Doctor C will have 0 patients since he's sick and can't see anyone.\n\nSo, finally:\n\n- Doctor A: 6 patients\n\n- Doctor B: 6 patients\n\n- Doctor C: 0 patients\n\nWait a minute, but the question might be interpreted differently. Maybe it's not specified which doctor is sick, but it doesn't matter which one it is because they all have the same number of patients initially. So, the outcome should be the same regardless of which doctor is sick.\n\nLet me just confirm:\n\nIf Doctor A is sick:\n\n- Doctor B takes 2 patients from Doctor A\n\n- Doctor C takes 2 patients from Doctor A\n\n- So, Doctor B: 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- Doctor C: 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- Doctor A: 0\n\nSimilarly, if Doctor B is sick:\n\n- Doctor A takes 2 patients from Doctor B\n\n- Doctor C takes 2 patients from Doctor B\n\n- Doctor A: 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- Doctor C: 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- Doctor B: 0\n\nAnd as I did earlier, if Doctor C is sick:\n\n- Doctor A takes 2 patients from Doctor C\n\n- Doctor B takes 2 patients from Doctor C\n\n- Doctor A: 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- Doctor B: 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- Doctor C: 0\n\nSo, in all scenarios, the two remaining doctors each have 6 patients, and the sick doctor has 0.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's consider the total number of patients.\n\nTotal patients initially: 3 doctors \u00d7 4 patients each = 12 patients.\n\nIf one doctor is sick, his 4 patients need to be distributed among the other two doctors. So, the total number of patients remains 12.\n\nThe two remaining doctors will split these 4 patients evenly, so each takes 2 additional patients.\n\nTherefore, each of the two doctors will have their original 4 patients plus 2 new ones, totaling 6 patients each.\n\nAnd the sick doctor has 0.\n\nSo, the answer is that each of the two remaining doctors has 6 patients.\n\nBut the question says, \"How many patients does each doctor now have?\"\n\nSo, to be complete, it should be:\n\n- Two doctors have 6 patients each\n\n- One doctor has 0 patients\n\nBut perhaps the question expects the number of patients per doctor after the redistribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the number of patients each of the working doctors has.\n\nLet me check again.\n\n\"One day, one of the doctors gets sick and cannot see any patients. The other two doctors decide to split the sick doctor's patients evenly between them. How many patients does each doctor now have?\"\n\nSo, it's clear that one doctor is out, and the other two take his patients.\n\nSo, as I calculated, each of the two doctors will have 6 patients, and the sick doctor has 0.\n\nBut maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps some people might think that the patients of the sick doctor are distributed proportionally or something, but no, it says evenly, so equally splitting them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some confusion about the total number of patients, but no, it's clearly 12 patients in total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that patients might choose not to see another doctor, but the problem doesn't suggest that; it says the other doctors split the patients evenly.\n\nSo, I think the conclusion is correct.\n\nEach of the two remaining doctors has 6 patients, and the sick doctor has 0.\n\nBut perhaps the question is trying to trick us or test our assumptions in some way.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose that when Doctor C is sick, his patients could go to Doctor A or Doctor B, but perhaps some patients prefer one over the other.\n\nBut the problem says the doctors decide to split the patients evenly, so preferences don't matter; it's decided by the doctors.\n\nSo, they split them evenly, meaning each takes 2 patients.\n\nThus, Doctor A: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nDoctor B: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nDoctor C: 0\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the patients are split based on some other criterion, but the problem specifies evenly, so it's equally divided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the doctors split all the patients again, but no, it's only the sick doctor's patients that are split.\n\nThe problem is specific about that.\n\nSo, I think the answer is indeed that each of the two remaining doctors has 6 patients.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider the total number of patient visits.\n\nInitially: 3 doctors \u00d7 4 patients = 12 patient visits per day.\n\nAfter one doctor is out: 2 doctors sharing the load.\n\nBut it's not specified that they are sharing all the patients; only that they split the sick doctor's patients evenly.\n\nSo, the other doctors keep their own patients.\n\nTherefore, as previously calculated, each of the two remaining doctors gets 2 additional patients, bringing their total to 6 each.\n\nAnd Doctor C has 0.\n\nSo, the answer is that each of the two working doctors has 6 patients, and the sick doctor has 0.\n\nBut the question says \"each doctor now has,\" which could imply all three, but likely it's asking about the working doctors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the number of patients per doctor after the redistribution, which would be 6 for the working ones and 0 for the sick one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's expecting a single number for each doctor, but that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's considering that the patients are redistributed proportionally to the number of patients the doctors already have.\n\nSo, Doctor A has 4 patients, Doctor B has 4, Doctor C has 4.\n\nDoctor C's 4 patients are to be split between A and B.\n\nIf they split them proportionally to their current load, since A and B have the same number of patients, it would still be equal, so each gets 2.\n\nThus, again, A: 6, B: 6, C: 0.\n\nAlternatively, if they split them based on some other criterion, but the problem says evenly, so it's likely just an equal split.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that each of the two working doctors has 6 patients.\n\nBut to directly answer the question: \"How many patients does each doctor now have?\"\n\n- Two doctors have 6 patients each.\n\n- One doctor has 0 patients.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting a single number, assuming that both working doctors have the same number.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be each working doctor has 6 patients.\n\nBut since it asks for each doctor, perhaps it's considering all three.\n\nSo, to be precise, two doctors have 6 patients each, and one has 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased to expect a single number, implying that all doctors now have the same number of patients, which wouldn't make sense in this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to solving this.\n\nWait, perhaps using algebra.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet x be the number of patients each working doctor has after the redistribution.\n\nSince two doctors are working and have the same number of patients, and the sick doctor has 0.\n\nTotal patients: 12.\n\nSo, 2x + 0 = 12\n\nTherefore, 2x = 12\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, each working doctor has 6 patients.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that the patients are distributed based on some ratio, but again, the problem says evenly, so it's equal distribution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that each of the two working doctors has 6 patients, and the sick doctor has 0.\n\nBut perhaps the question is interpreted differently, thinking that all doctors still have patients, which isn't the case since one is sick and can't see any patients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that the sick doctor's patients are divided among all remaining doctors, but in this case, there are only two remaining doctors.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the other two doctors decide to split the sick doctor's patients evenly between them.\"\n\nSo, it's clear that only the two remaining doctors are splitting the sick doctor's patients.\n\nTherefore, each of them takes 2 patients from the sick doctor.\n\nThus, their patient load becomes:\n\n- Original patients: 4 each\n\n- Additional patients: 2 each\n\n- Total: 6 each\n\n- Sick doctor: 0\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that the two doctors split all the patients evenly, but no, the problem specifies that they split only the sick doctor's patients evenly.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains that each of the two working doctors has 6 patients, and the sick doctor has 0.\n\nBut to directly answer the question: \"How many patients does each doctor now have?\"\n\nIt would be:\n\n- Two doctors have 6 patients each.\n\n- One doctor has 0 patients.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is expecting a single number, perhaps it's 6, assuming that's the number for each working doctor.\n\nBut since it asks for each doctor, it's probably better to specify that two have 6 and one has 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the sick doctor's patients are split among all remaining doctors, including themselves, but that's not the case here.\n\nThe problem clearly states that the other two doctors split the sick doctor's patients evenly between them.\n\nTherefore, they only split the sick doctor's patients, not their own.\n\nHence, the conclusion is correct.\n\nEach of the two working doctors has 6 patients, and the sick doctor has 0.\n\nSo, the final answer is that each of the two working doctors has 6 patients.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
