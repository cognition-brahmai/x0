While it doesn't furnish direct answers, it compiles a catalogue of potential information sources.\nSiteScanner[input]: Scans content from one or more URLs contained in the input string (links separated by newlines) and delivers it as plain text.\nURLHarvester[input]: Harvests URLs from any submitted plain text and returns them as newline-separated plain text.\nSolutionProvider[input]: An advanced AI model proficient in answering questions using universal knowledge or specific context derived from prior evidence.\n\nFunction inputs should be bare strings, sans quotation marks or \"+\" symbols used for string concatenation, e.g., SolutionProvider[What is the longest river, given :evidence3:?]\n\nEnsure that each plan segment corresponds to exactly one evidence output.\n\nOutput format:\nPlan: [Primary action based on the question]\n:evidence0: = [Triggering of function with input parameter]\nPlan: [Secondary action, dependent on the outcome of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [Triggering of subsequent function with input parameter, possibly referencing previous evidence, e.g., \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: What is artificial intelligence and where is it mainly applied?"
