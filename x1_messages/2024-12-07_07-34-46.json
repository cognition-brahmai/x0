        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThere's a store that sells three types of pens: blue, black, and red. The probabilities given are:\n\n- Blue pen: 0.4\n\n- Black pen: 0.35\n\n- Red pen: 0.25\n\nAnd the question is, if a customer buys two pens, what's the probability that they buy one blue pen and one black pen?\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand the scenario. A customer is buying two pens, and I need to find the probability that one is blue and the other is black.\n\nI should consider whether the order in which the pens are bought matters. For example, does it make a difference if the customer buys a blue pen first and then a black pen, or a black pen first and then a blue pen?\n\nActually, since the problem just says \"one blue pen and one black pen\" without specifying the order, I think both sequences are possible: blue then black, or black then blue.\n\nSo, maybe I need to calculate the probability for each sequence and then add them together.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, the probability of buying a blue pen first and then a black pen.\n\nThe probability of buying a blue pen first is 0.4.\n\nGiven that the first pen is blue, what's the probability of buying a black pen second?\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify whether the pens are being drawn with replacement or without replacement. Like, is the customer choosing two pens one after the other, and does the first choice affect the second?\n\nHmm.\n\nIf it's with replacement, then the probabilities stay the same for each draw.\n\nIf it's without replacement, then the probabilities might change after the first draw.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume it's with replacement, unless there's a reason to think otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are given for each type, and the draws are independent.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf the pens are drawn with replacement, or if there's a large number of pens such that the probabilities don't change much between draws, then the probabilities can be considered independent.\n\nIn that case, the probability of buying a blue pen and then a black pen would be 0.4 times 0.35.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of buying a black pen and then a blue pen would be 0.35 times 0.4.\n\nThen, since these are two distinct sequences that both result in one blue and one black pen, I can add their probabilities together.\n\nSo, total probability = (0.4 * 0.35) + (0.35 * 0.4)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n0.4 * 0.35 = 0.14\n\nAnd 0.35 * 0.4 = 0.14\n\nSo, 0.14 + 0.14 = 0.28\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.28.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider combinations instead of permutations.\n\nSince the order doesn't matter\u2014the problem doesn't specify the order\u2014maybe I should use combinations.\n\nIn that case, the number of ways to choose one blue and one black pen is simply the combination of one blue and one black.\n\nBut in probability terms, I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of binomial probabilities.\n\nBut binomial probabilities are for events with two outcomes, and here there are three types of pens.\n\nMaybe I should consider the multinomial probability formula.\n\nThe multinomial coefficient is used when there are more than two categories.\n\nIn this case, we have three categories: blue, black, and red.\n\nBut in the problem, we're only interested in the case where the customer buys one blue and one black pen, and no red pens.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability is the multinomial probability for two pens, with counts: blue=1, black=1, red=0.\n\nThe multinomial probability formula is:\n\nP = (n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)) * (p1^n1 * p2^n2 * ... * pk^nk)\n\nWhere n is the total number of trials, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the counts in each category, and p1, p2, ..., pk are the probabilities for each category.\n\nIn this case, n = 2, n_blue = 1, n_black = 1, n_red = 0, p_blue = 0.4, p_black = 0.35, p_red = 0.25.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nP = (2! / (1! * 1! * 0!)) * (0.4^1 * 0.35^1 * 0.25^0)\n\nCalculating factorials: 2! = 2, 1! = 1, 0! = 1\n\nSo, 2 / (1 * 1 * 1) = 2\n\nThen, 0.4 * 0.35 * 1 (since anything to the power of 0 is 1) = 0.14\n\nThen, 2 * 0.14 = 0.28\n\nSo, again, I get 0.28.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.28.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nSuppose I try to use the concept of dependent events, assuming that the pens are drawn without replacement.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, and the probabilities are given for each type, which might imply that the probabilities are constant, meaning replacement or a large stock.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are meant to represent the overall probabilities, regardless of the drawing mechanism.\n\nGiven that, and since both approaches give me the same answer, I think 0.28 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.28} \\]"
