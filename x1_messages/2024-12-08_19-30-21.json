        "content": "So I've got this probability problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a bag with 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. So, total balls in the bag are 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls. I need to draw 3 balls at random without replacement, and I want to find the probability that I get exactly one ball of each color. Okay, sounds straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"without replacement\" means. It means that once I draw a ball, I don't put it back into the bag. So, each draw affects the remaining balls in the bag.\n\nNow, to find the probability of drawing one ball of each color, I need to figure out two things:\n\n1. The total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 10.\n\n2. The number of favorable ways to draw one ball of each color.\n\nThen, the probability will be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet's start with the total number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 10. Since the order doesn't matter (I'm just interested in the combination of colors, not the order in which I draw them), I should use combinations, not permutations. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 10 is:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10 - 3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3! \\times 7!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the 7! in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 3) = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{3! \\times 7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3!} = \\frac{720}{6} = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 120 possible ways to draw 3 balls out of 10.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable ways to draw one ball of each color. There are 3 colors: red, blue, and green. I need one of each.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many ways to choose one red ball out of 5. That's simply:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 1) = \\frac{5!}{1!(5 - 1)!} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose one blue ball out of 3 is:\n\n\\[\nC(3, 1) = \\frac{3!}{1!(3 - 1)!} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose one green ball out of 2 is:\n\n\\[\nC(2, 1) = \\frac{2!}{1!(2 - 1)!} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n\\]\n\nSince these are independent choices, the total number of favorable ways to choose one ball of each color is the product of these individual choices:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 30 favorable ways to draw one ball of each color.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{one of each color}) = \\frac{30}{120} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems too simple. Let me double-check if I've considered everything correctly.\n\nI recall that in probability problems involving multiple stages, sometimes it's helpful to think about the problem step by step, considering the changing probabilities at each stage since it's without replacement.\n\nLet me try another approach to verify this result.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nI can think of the drawing process as a sequence of three draws, and calculate the probability for each possible sequence that results in one ball of each color.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 possible sequences for drawing one of each color:\n\n1. Red, then Blue, then Green\n\n2. Red, then Green, then Blue\n\n3. Blue, then Red, then Green\n\n4. Blue, then Green, then Red\n\n5. Green, then Red, then Blue\n\n6. Green, then Blue, then Red\n\nI can calculate the probability for one of these sequences and then multiply by the number of sequences, since each sequence is equally likely.\n\nLet's take the sequence Red, then Blue, then Green.\n\n- The probability of drawing a red ball first is \\(\\frac{5}{10}\\), since there are 5 red balls out of 10.\n\n- Given that a red ball has been drawn, there are now 9 balls left in the bag. The probability of drawing a blue ball next is \\(\\frac{3}{9}\\).\n\n- Given that a red and a blue ball have been drawn, there are now 8 balls left. The probability of drawing a green ball next is \\(\\frac{2}{8}\\).\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{10} \\times \\frac{3}{9} \\times \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{5}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{120} = \\frac{1}{24}\n\\]\n\nSince there are 6 such sequences, the total probability is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{6}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nOkay, this matches the previous result. So, the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nWait, but I feel like I should consider whether the order matters or not. In the first approach, I used combinations, which don't consider order, and in the second approach, I considered ordered sequences and multiplied by the number of permutations.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of combinations only.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 10 is \\( C(10, 3) = 120 \\), as before.\n\nNumber of ways to choose one red, one blue, and one green ball is \\( C(5, 1) \\times C(3, 1) \\times C(2, 1) = 5 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 30 \\), as before.\n\nSo, probability is \\( \\frac{30}{120} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of multivariate hypergeometric distribution, since I'm drawing without replacement from a finite population with multiple categories.\n\nThe formula for the probability of drawing exactly \\( k_1 \\) red, \\( k_2 \\) blue, and \\( k_3 \\) green balls when drawing \\( k = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 \\) balls from a population of \\( N = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 \\) balls is:\n\n\\[\nP(k_1, k_2, k_3) = \\frac{C(n_1, k_1) \\times C(n_2, k_2) \\times C(n_3, k_3)}{C(N, k)}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\( n_1 = 5 \\) red, \\( n_2 = 3 \\) blue, \\( n_3 = 2 \\) green, \\( k_1 = 1 \\), \\( k_2 = 1 \\), \\( k_3 = 1 \\), and \\( k = 3 \\), \\( N = 10 \\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(1, 1, 1) = \\frac{C(5, 1) \\times C(3, 1) \\times C(2, 1)}{C(10, 3)} = \\frac{5 \\times 3 \\times 2}{120} = \\frac{30}{120} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some probability problems, especially with multiple categories, the order might matter or not, and sometimes people get confused.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of ways to arrange the colors divided by the total number of possible arrangements.\n\nBut I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now, and all point to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) being the correct probability.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any overlap or if I'm missing any conditions.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the probability step by step, considering the draws without replacement.\n\nFor example:\n\n- First draw: any color except the ones that would make it impossible to have one of each.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and since all previous methods give \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), I think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can simulate it.\n\nSuppose I list all possible combinations of 3 balls out of 10 and count how many have one of each color.\n\nTotal combinations: 120, as calculated before.\n\nFavorable combinations: 30, as calculated before.\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{30}{120} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the colors are distinguishable only by their counts, and if there's any difference in how they are picked.\n\nBut no, the problem specifies the counts for each color, and I'm assuming that balls of the same color are indistinct, which is standard in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, if balls of the same color are distinct (e.g., numbered), that would change things, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nGiven that, I think \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) is the correct probability.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly one ball of each color is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
