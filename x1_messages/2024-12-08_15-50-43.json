It's just me and the words on the page, and before I know it, I'm completely lost in this other world that the author has created. It's almost like magic, if you ask me.\n\nTake Matilda, for example. She was such a smart kid, always reading and learning new things. Books were her escape from her awful family. They took her to places she'd never been and introduced her to characters that became her friends. And that's exactly how I feel when I read a great book. It's like I have this whole new universe to explore, and no one can take that away from me.\n\nSo, in a way, reading is like having a superpower, isn't it? It lets you see through the eyes of others, experience different lives, and learn so much without even leaving your chair. It's incredibly joyful and fulfilling. That's why I love books so much. They're like treasure chests filled with endless possibilities."
