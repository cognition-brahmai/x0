        "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got a village with 20 houses, and each house has at least one cat. The total number of cats in the village is 100, and we need to find out the minimum number of cats that must be in at least one house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We need to find the smallest number such that at least one house has that many cats or more. In other words, we're looking for the minimum possible maximum number of cats in any single house.\n\nTo minimize the maximum number of cats in any house, we should try to distribute the cats as evenly as possible among all the houses. However, since 100 cats divided by 20 houses is 5 cats per house, but the problem states that each house has at least one cat, and we need to find the minimum number that must be in at least one house, perhaps some houses have more than 5 cats.\n\nWait, 100 divided by 20 is exactly 5. So if each house had exactly 5 cats, that would account for all 100 cats. But the problem says each house has at least one cat, and we need to find the minimum number that must be in at least one house.\n\nIf every house had exactly 5 cats, then the minimum number that must be in at least one house is 5. But maybe some houses have fewer than 5 cats, which would require other houses to have more than 5 cats to make up the total of 100 cats.\n\nLet's consider that some houses have only one cat, the minimum allowed. If 19 houses have exactly one cat each, then the total number of cats in those 19 houses is 19 cats. Since there are 100 cats in total, the remaining house must have 100 - 19 = 81 cats.\n\nSo in this scenario, the minimum number that must be in at least one house is 81.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to have a smaller maximum number by distributing the cats differently.\n\nSuppose that some houses have more than one cat, but less than 81. For example, if 18 houses have one cat each, and one house has two cats, then the last house would need to have 100 - 18 - 2 = 80 cats. That's still a high number.\n\nWait a minute, actually, if 18 houses have one cat, and one house has two cats, that's 18 + 2 = 20 cats, and then the last house would have 100 - 20 = 80 cats. So the minimum number that must be in at least one house is still 80.\n\nIf we have 17 houses with one cat, one house with two cats, and one house with three cats, then the total for those 19 houses is 17 + 2 + 3 = 22 cats, and the last house would have 100 - 22 = 78 cats.\n\nSo, by increasing the number of cats in some houses beyond one, we can reduce the number of cats in the house with the most cats.\n\nWait, but in this case, the house with the most cats still has 78 cats, which is still quite high.\n\nLet's see if we can find a pattern here.\n\nIf k houses have one cat each, and the remaining (20 - k) houses share the remaining (100 - k) cats, then the house with the most cats would have at least ceil((100 - k)/(20 - k)) cats.\n\nBut we want to minimize the maximum number of cats in any house, which would involve maximizing k, the number of houses with one cat.\n\nHowever, in the earlier example, when k = 19, the last house has 100 - 19 = 81 cats.\n\nWhen k = 18, the last two houses have 100 - 18 = 82 cats, which would be divided between two houses, so each would have at least 41 cats.\n\nWait, 82 divided between two houses: if one house has 41 cats and the other has 41 cats, then the maximum is 41.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So with k = 18 houses having one cat each, the remaining two houses share 82 cats, which can be divided as 41 and 41, so the maximum is 41.\n\nIf k = 17, then the remaining three houses share 100 - 17 = 83 cats.\n\nIf we divide 83 by 3, we get approximately 27.67, so at least one house must have 28 cats.\n\nWait, but to find the minimum maximum, we need to see what's the smallest possible maximum number of cats in any house.\n\nSo, if we have k houses with one cat each, and the remaining (20 - k) houses share the remaining (100 - k) cats, then the maximum number of cats in any house is ceil((100 - k)/(20 - k)).\n\nWe need to minimize this ceil((100 - k)/(20 - k)).\n\nTo minimize the maximum, we need to maximize the denominator (20 - k), which means minimizing k.\n\nWait, but k is the number of houses with one cat. If we minimize k, that means more houses have more than one cat, which could lead to higher maximums.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose we want to minimize the maximum number of cats in any house.\n\nTo do this, we should distribute the cats as evenly as possible among all houses.\n\nSo, if we divide 100 cats among 20 houses, 100 / 20 = 5 cats per house.\n\nSince 100 is divisible by 20, if each house has exactly 5 cats, then the maximum is 5.\n\nBut the problem states that each house has at least one cat, but doesn't specify any further constraints.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimum number that must be in at least one house is 5.\n\nWait, but in the earlier scenario where some houses have only one cat, one house ends up with 81 cats, which is much higher.\n\nBut if we distribute the cats more evenly, we can have all houses with 5 cats, totaling 100 cats.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimum number that must be in at least one house is 5.\n\nBut is there a way that at least one house has fewer than 5 cats?\n\nWait, no, because if each house has at least one cat, and we distribute the remaining cats as evenly as possible, we still end up with each house having 5 cats.\n\nLet me check:\n\nStart by giving each house one cat: that's 20 cats.\n\nRemaining cats: 100 - 20 = 80 cats.\n\nNow, distribute these 80 cats evenly among the 20 houses: 80 / 20 = 4 cats per house.\n\nSo, each house gets an additional 4 cats, making it 5 cats per house.\n\nTherefore, in this distribution, no house has more than 5 cats.\n\nBut in the earlier scenario, by having some houses with only one cat, we forced one house to have 81 cats.\n\nSo, the minimal maximum is 5 cats per house.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the minimum number of cats that must be in at least one house.\n\nIn the even distribution, each house has 5 cats, so the minimum number that must be in at least one house is 5.\n\nIn the uneven distribution, one house has 81 cats, but others have only one.\n\nSo, the minimal maximum is 5, but the minimal number that must be in at least one house could be lower if some houses have more.\n\nWait, no, if we have one house with more cats, other houses have fewer, but the minimum number that must be in at least one house is still 5 in the even distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing minimal maximum with something else.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"what is the minimum number of cats that must be in at least one house?\"\n\nSo, we need to find the smallest possible number such that at least one house has that many cats or more.\n\nIn the even distribution, each house has 5 cats, so the minimum number that must be in at least one house is 5.\n\nIn the uneven distribution, one house has 81 cats, but others have only one, so the minimum number that must be in at least one house is still 1, but that's not the minimum possible for the house with the most cats.\n\nWait, I think I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nPerhaps it's asking for the smallest possible number where at least one house has that number or more cats.\n\nSo, to minimize that number, we need to make sure that at least one house has as few cats as possible, but that doesn't make sense because the question is about the maximum.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of guarantees.\n\nGiven that there are 20 houses and 100 cats, with each house having at least one cat, what is the smallest number k such that at least one house has k or more cats?\n\nTo find this, we need to consider the distribution where the cats are as evenly spread as possible.\n\nIf we distribute the cats as evenly as possible, then the maximum number of cats in any house is minimized.\n\nSo, in this case, distributing 100 cats among 20 houses, each house gets 5 cats.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number k that must be in at least one house is 5.\n\nBut let's consider if it's possible to have k less than 5.\n\nIf k were 4, for example, could we have at least one house with 4 or more cats?\n\nWell, if each house has at least one cat, and some have more, but if we try to keep the maximum at 4, then the maximum number of cats per house is 4.\n\nSo, with 20 houses, each having at most 4 cats, the total number of cats would be at most 20 * 4 = 80 cats.\n\nBut the total number of cats is 100, which is more than 80, so it's impossible for all houses to have at most 4 cats.\n\nTherefore, at least one house must have at least 5 cats.\n\nHence, the minimum number k that must be in at least one house is 5.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use the pigeonhole principle.\n\nThe pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, we have 100 cats (n = 100) and 20 houses (m = 20).\n\nUsing the generalized pigeonhole principle, the minimum number k such that at least one house has k or more cats is given by ceil(n/m).\n\nSo, ceil(100/20) = ceil(5) = 5.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of cats that must be in at least one house is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
