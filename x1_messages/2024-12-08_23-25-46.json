It's different from Spanish or Italian, even though they are all Romance languages coming from Latin. The reason Brazil speaks Portuguese is because it was colonized by Portugal a long time ago. So, the language stayed even after Brazil became independent. Have you ever tried to speak Portuguese? It has some unique sounds and words that might be fun to learn!"
