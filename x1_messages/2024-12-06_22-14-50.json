        "content": "Let's see. I have this election problem here. Candidate A got 55% of the total votes, Candidate B got 35%, and the remaining 10% were invalid. The total number of votes cast was 20,000. I need to find out how many more votes Candidate A received compared to Candidate B.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many votes each candidate actually received. Since the total votes are 20,000, I can calculate the number of votes for Candidate A by taking 55% of 20,000. Similarly, for Candidate B, it's 35% of 20,000.\n\nSo, votes for Candidate A = 55% of 20,000.\n\nTo calculate that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 55% is 0.55. So, 0.55 times 20,000.\n\nLet me do the math: 0.55 \u00d7 20,000 = 11,000 votes.\n\nSimilarly, votes for Candidate B = 35% of 20,000.\n\nAgain, convert 35% to a decimal, which is 0.35. So, 0.35 times 20,000.\n\nThat's 0.35 \u00d7 20,000 = 7,000 votes.\n\nNow, to find out how many more votes Candidate A received than Candidate B, I just need to subtract the votes for Candidate B from the votes for Candidate A.\n\nSo, 11,000 - 7,000 = 4,000 votes.\n\nTherefore, Candidate A received 4,000 more votes than Candidate B.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can find the difference in their percentages first and then apply that to the total number of votes.\n\nLet's try that. The difference in percentages between Candidate A and Candidate B is 55% - 35% = 20%.\n\nThen, 20% of the total votes would be the difference in their vote counts.\n\nSo, 20% of 20,000 is 0.20 \u00d7 20,000 = 4,000 votes.\n\nHey, that matches my earlier calculation. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also check the number of invalid votes.\n\nInvalid votes are 10% of 20,000, which is 0.10 \u00d7 20,000 = 2,000 votes.\n\nAdding up the votes: Candidate A has 11,000, Candidate B has 7,000, invalid votes are 2,000. Total is 11,000 + 7,000 + 2,000 = 20,000, which matches the total votes cast.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4000} \\]"
