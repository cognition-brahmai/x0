        "content": "In \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\" James Thurber employs several literary devices to enhance the narrative and emphasize the themes of the story. Among the options provided\u2014irony, metaphor, contrast, and hyperbole\u2014the most prominently used device is contrast.\n\nContrast is central to the structure and meaning of the story. It is through the stark difference between Walter Mitty's everyday life and his elaborate daydreams that Thurber illustrates the disconnect between reality and fantasy in Mitty's mind. Walter's real life is depicted as dull, passive, and controlled by others, particularly his overbearing wife. In contrast, his daydreams are adventurous, heroic, and independent.\n\nFor example, in reality, Walter is a timid man who meekly submits to his wife's demands, but in his fantasies, he is a bold and decisive figure, such as a skilled surgeon or a courageous pilot. This contrast highlights Walter's dissatisfaction with his life and his escape into fantasy as a coping mechanism.\n\nWhile other devices like irony, metaphor, and hyperbole are present in the story, contrast is the most pervasive and significant in developing the character and themes. Irony is used, for instance, in the discrepancy between Walter's perceived importance in his daydreams and his actual insignificance in reality. Metaphors might be used to describe his experiences, and hyperbole exaggerates elements of his fantasies, but it is the contrast between his real life and his imagined adventures that drives the narrative and engages the reader.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Contrast."
