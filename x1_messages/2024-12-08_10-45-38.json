We know that the derivative of e^(kx) with respect to x is k*e^(kx), so the antiderivative of e^(kx) is (1/k)*e^(kx). In this case, k = 2, so the antiderivative of e^(2x) is (1/2)*e^(2x).\n\nNext, we evaluate this antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of integration and subtract the lower limit value from the upper limit value.\n\nSo, \u222b from 0 to 1 of e^(2x) dx = [(1/2)*e^(2*1)] - [(1/2)*e^(2*0)] = (1/2)*e^2 - (1/2)*e^0 = (1/2)*e^2 - (1/2)*1 = (1/2)*(e^2 - 1).\n\nTherefore, the integral of g(x) = e^(2x) from 0 to 1 is (1/2)*(e^2 - 1)."
