        "content": "Let's see. The factory produces 1000 units of Product A and 2000 units of Product B daily. Each unit of Product A needs 3 workers, and each unit of Product B needs 2 workers. There are 8000 workers in total. I need to find out how many more units of Product A can be produced if all remaining workers are assigned to Product A.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many workers are currently assigned to producing Product A and Product B.\n\nFor Product A:\n\n1000 units * 3 workers/unit = 3000 workers\n\nFor Product B:\n\n2000 units * 2 workers/unit = 4000 workers\n\nTotal workers assigned currently:\n\n3000 (Product A) + 4000 (Product B) = 7000 workers\n\nThe factory has 8000 workers in total, so the number of unused workers is:\n\n8000 - 7000 = 1000 workers\n\nNow, if all remaining 1000 workers are assigned to produce only Product A, and each unit of Product A requires 3 workers, then the number of additional units of Product A that can be produced is:\n\n1000 workers / 3 workers/unit = 333.333... units\n\nSince we can't produce a fraction of a unit, we'll round down to 333 units.\n\nSo, the factory can produce 333 more units of Product A if all remaining workers are assigned to it.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recalculate the workers assigned to each product:\n\nProduct A: 1000 units * 3 workers/unit = 3000 workers\n\nProduct B: 2000 units * 2 workers/unit = 4000 workers\n\nTotal assigned: 3000 + 4000 = 7000 workers\n\nTotal workers: 8000\n\nRemaining workers: 8000 - 7000 = 1000 workers\n\nNow, assigning these 1000 workers to Product A, which requires 3 workers per unit:\n\nNumber of additional units = 1000 / 3 = 333.333...\n\nRounding down to 333 units.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of worker units required per product unit and see if there's a more efficient way to allocate the workers, but the question specifies that all remaining workers are assigned to produce only Product A.\n\nSo, no need to consider other allocations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 333 more units of Product A can be produced.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{333} \\]"
