        "content": "You're referring to the Narwhal, often called the \"unicorn of the sea\" due to the long, spiral tusk protruding from its upper jaw, which resembles the horn of a mythical unicorn. The narwhal is a type of whale found primarily in the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada, and Russia. The tusk is actually a tooth that can grow up to 10 feet long and is sensitive to touch and temperature changes, suggesting it may have sensory functions. Additionally, the narwhal's skin changes color with age, transitioning from a blueish-gray in calves to a mottled black and white pattern in adults. They are known for their deep dives, reaching depths of over 1,500 meters in search of prey such as fish, shrimp, and squid. The narwhal is also known for its complex social structure and communication methods, including a range of clicks, whistles, and pulsed sounds."
