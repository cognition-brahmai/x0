        "content": "Sure! I can help you with that. So, you want a Golang program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. The program should ask the user for a number and then print its factorial.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It's denoted by n!. For example, 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNow, recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, this means a function calls itself with a simpler version of the original problem.\n\nFor factorials, the recursive definition is:\n\n- If n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.\n\n- Otherwise, n! = n \u00d7 (n-1)!.\n\nSo, we'll write a function that calls itself with n-1 until it reaches the base case of n being 0 or 1.\n\nHere's how you can write this program in Go:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc factorial(n int) int {\n\tif n == 0 || n == 1 {\n\t\treturn 1\n\t}\n\treturn n * factorial(n-1)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar num int\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \")\n\tfmt.Scan(&num)\n\tif num < 0 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tresult := factorial(num)\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"The factorial of %d is %d\\n\", num, result)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. We define a function `factorial` that takes an integer `n` and returns its factorial.\n\n2. In the `factorial` function, we check if `n` is 0 or 1. If it is, we return 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.\n\n3. If `n` is greater than 1, we return `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`. This is the recursive call.\n\n4. In the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer.\n\n5. We read the input using `fmt.Scan` and store it in the variable `num`.\n\n6. We check if the input is negative. If it is, we print a message saying factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\n7. If the input is non-negative, we call the `factorial` function with `num` and print the result.\n\nRemember, recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the input is too large because each recursive call adds a layer to the call stack. In Go, the default stack size is relatively small, so for large inputs, you might need to increase the stack size using the `-stack` flag when running the program, or consider using an iterative approach instead.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
