        "content": "Let's see. There are 120 people divided into three teams: Team A, Team B, and Team C. According to the problem, Team A has twice as many members as Team B, and Team C has 10 fewer members than Team A. I need to find out how many members are in each team.\n\nFirst, I should assign variables to represent the number of members in each team. Let's let the number of members in Team B be represented by B. Since Team A has twice as many members as Team B, Team A will have 2B members. Team C has 10 fewer members than Team A, so Team C will have 2B - 10 members.\n\nNow, since the total number of people is 120, the sum of the members in all three teams should equal 120. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nTeam A + Team B + Team C = 120\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of B:\n\n2B + B + (2B - 10) = 120\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n2B + B + 2B - 10 = 120\n\nThat's 5B - 10 = 120\n\nNext, I'll add 10 to both sides to isolate the terms with B:\n\n5B - 10 + 10 = 120 + 10\n\n5B = 130\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5 to solve for B:\n\n5B / 5 = 130 / 5\n\nB = 26\n\nSo, Team B has 26 members.\n\nNow, Team A has twice as many members as Team B, so:\n\nTeam A = 2 * 26 = 52 members\n\nAnd Team C has 10 fewer members than Team A:\n\nTeam C = 52 - 10 = 42 members\n\nLet me check if these add up to 120:\n\n52 + 26 + 42 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nTeam A has 52 members, Team B has 26 members, and Team C has 42 members."
