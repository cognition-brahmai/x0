        "content": "Let's see. So, three friends are splitting a $60 gift equally. That means each should pay $20, right? Because 60 divided by 3 is 20.\n\nBut one friend forgets his wallet and can only contribute half of his share. So, his share is $20, but he can only pay half of that, which is $10.\n\nSo, he's short by $10. That $10 has to be covered by the other two friends. So, the total amount that needs to be covered is still $60, but since one friend is only paying $10 instead of $20, the other two friends need to pay an extra $10 together.\n\nThat means each of the other two friends has to pay an extra $5, because $10 divided by 2 is $5.\n\nSo, the friend who forgot his wallet pays $10, and each of the other two friends pays $20 plus $5, which is $25.\n\nLet me check if that adds up: $25 + $25 + $10 = $60. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, each of the two friends who have their wallets pays $25, and the one who forgot his wallet pays $10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25 \\text{ dollars each for two friends and } 10 \\text{ dollars for the third friend}} \\]"
