        "content": "Alright, I'm going to walk you through creating a simple web server in Go that serves static files from a specified directory and logs details about each incoming request. This will involve using Go's built-in `net/http` package.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Go Environment\n\nFirst, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/). After installation, set up your GOPATH and make sure your environment is correctly configured.\n\n### Step 2: Create a New Go Project\n\nCreate a new directory for your project and initialize a new Go module.\n\n```bash\nmkdir static-server\ncd static-server\ngo mod init static-server\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the Server Code\n\nCreate a new Go file, for example, `main.go`, and open it in your favorite text editor.\n\n### Step 4: Import Necessary Packages\n\nYou'll need to import the `net/http` package to handle HTTP requests and responses.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Set Up the File Server\n\nDefine the directory you want to serve static files from. For this example, let's assume the static files are in a directory named `static`.\n\n```go\nconst (\n\tstaticDir = \"static\"\n)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Create a Logger Middleware\n\nTo log request details, you can create a middleware function that wraps the file server handler. This middleware will log the HTTP method, path, and response status code for each request.\n\n```go\nfunc logRequests(next http.Handler) http.Handler {\n\treturn http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"Method: %s, Path: %s\", r.Method, r.URL.Path)\n\t\trecorder := &statusRecorder{\n\t\t\tResponseWriter: w,\n\t\t\tstatusCode:     http.StatusOK,\n\t\t}\n\t\tnext.ServeHTTP(recorder, r)\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"Response Status: %d\", recorder.statusCode)\n\t})\n}\n\ntype statusRecorder struct {\n\thttp.ResponseWriter\n\tstatusCode int\n}\n\nfunc (r *statusRecorder) WriteHeader(code int) {\n\tr.statusCode = code\n\tr.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader(code)\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Configure and Start the Server\n\nSet up the file server, apply the logging middleware, and start the HTTP server on a specified port.\n\n```go\nfunc main() {\n\tfileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir(staticDir))\n\thandler := logRequests(fileServer)\n\thttp.Handle(\"/\", handler)\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Starting server at port 8080\\n\")\n\tif err := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Could not start server: %s\\n\", err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Step 8: Run the Server\n\nSave your `main.go` file and run the server using the following command:\n\n```bash\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nThis will start your web server, and it should be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Any static files in the `static` directory will be served, and each request will be logged with its method, path, and response status code.\n\n### Step 9: Test the Server\n\nOpen your web browser or use a tool like `curl` to access different paths in your `static` directory and verify that the files are served correctly and that the requests are logged as expected.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple static file server in Go with request logging.\n\n### Additional Enhancements\n\n- **Custom Error Pages:** You can customize error responses to provide better user feedback.\n- **Security Headers:** Add security headers to enhance the security of your server.\n- **HTTPS Support:** Configure your server to serve over HTTPS for secure connections.\n- **Request Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.\n\nThese enhancements can be added as you become more comfortable with Go and web server programming."
