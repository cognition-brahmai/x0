        "content": "So the factory makes 250 widgets each day, and it works every day of the year, which is 365 days. I need to find out how many widgets it makes in a whole year.\n\nWell, to find the total number of widgets produced in a year, I should multiply the daily production by the number of days in a year. So, that would be 250 widgets per day times 365 days.\n\nLet me do the math: 250 multiplied by 365.\n\nFirst, I can break it down. I know that 250 times 100 is 25,000. Then, 250 times 200 is 50,000. Wait, no, 250 times 200 should be 50,000, but actually, 250 times 100 is 25,000, so 250 times 300 would be 75,000, right? Because 250 times 100 is 25,000, times 3 is 75,000.\n\nThen, I have to account for the remaining 65 days. So, 250 times 65.\n\nLet's calculate 250 times 65.\n\n250 times 60 is 15,000, and 250 times 5 is 1,250. So, 15,000 plus 1,250 is 16,250.\n\nNow, add that to the 75,000 from earlier: 75,000 plus 16,250 is 91,250.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake somewhere because 250 times 365 should be higher than that.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I can think of 365 as 365 = 365.\n\nSo, 250 times 365.\n\nAlternatively, I can multiply 250 by 365 directly.\n\n250 times 300 is 75,000.\n\n250 times 60 is 15,000.\n\n250 times 5 is 1,250.\n\nNow, add them up: 75,000 plus 15,000 is 90,000, plus 1,250 is 91,250.\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify.\n\nI know that 250 times 400 is 100,000.\n\nThen, 250 times 365 is 250 times (400 - 35), which is 250 times 400 minus 250 times 35.\n\n250 times 400 is 100,000.\n\n250 times 35 is 8,750.\n\nSo, 100,000 minus 8,750 is 91,250.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use division or another method, but this seems consistent.\n\nSo, the factory produces 91,250 widgets in a year.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me check again.\n\n250 times 365.\n\nLet's multiply step by step.\n\nFirst, 250 times 5 is 1,250.\n\n250 times 60 is 15,000.\n\n250 times 300 is 75,000.\n\nAdding them up: 1,250 plus 15,000 is 16,250, plus 75,000 is 91,250.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the factory will produce 91,250 widgets in a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{91250} \\]"
