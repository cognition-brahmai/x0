        "content": "Let's see. I have this problem here: There are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. Houses divisible by 4 have blue doors, and houses divisible by 6 have red doors. I need to find out how many houses have both blue and red doors.\n\nSo, if a house has both blue and red doors, that means it's divisible by both 4 and 6. So, I need to find the number of houses that are divisible by both 4 and 6.\n\nI recall that if I want to find numbers divisible by both 4 and 6, I should look for numbers that are divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 6. That makes sense because the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.\n\nSo, first, let's find the LCM of 4 and 6.\n\nThe prime factors of 4 are 2 \u00d7 2.\n\nThe prime factors of 6 are 2 \u00d7 3.\n\nThe LCM would be the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. So, that would be 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12.\n\nSo, houses that are divisible by 12 will have both blue and red doors.\n\nNow, I need to find how many houses between 1 and 100 are divisible by 12.\n\nTo do that, I can divide 100 by 12 and find the integer part of the quotient.\n\n100 \u00f7 12 = 8.333...\n\nSo, there are 8 houses that are divisible by 12 within 100.\n\nBut let me double-check that.\n\nLet's list the multiples of 12 up to 100:\n\n12 \u00d7 1 = 12\n\n12 \u00d7 2 = 24\n\n12 \u00d7 3 = 36\n\n12 \u00d7 4 = 48\n\n12 \u00d7 5 = 60\n\n12 \u00d7 6 = 72\n\n12 \u00d7 7 = 84\n\n12 \u00d7 8 = 96\n\n12 \u00d7 9 = 108, which is greater than 100, so it's not included.\n\nSo, indeed, there are 8 houses that are divisible by 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 houses that have both blue and red doors.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that in set theory, the number of elements in the intersection of two sets A and B is given by |A \u2229 B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u222a B|.\n\nBut in this case, since we're looking for houses divisible by both 4 and 6, which is the intersection of houses divisible by 4 and houses divisible by 6, perhaps I should use that formula.\n\nLet me try that approach as well.\n\nFirst, find the number of houses divisible by 4.\n\n100 \u00f7 4 = 25, so there are 25 houses with blue doors.\n\nNext, find the number of houses divisible by 6.\n\n100 \u00f7 6 \u2248 16.666, so there are 16 houses with red doors.\n\nNow, the number of houses with either blue or red doors would be |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nBut in this problem, we're actually interested in |A \u2229 B|, which is the number of houses with both blue and red doors.\n\nSo, rearranging the formula, |A \u2229 B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u222a B|.\n\nBut I don't know |A \u222a B| directly.\n\nHowever, I know that the total number of houses is 100, and some houses may have neither blue nor red doors, but in this problem, I'm only interested in houses that have both.\n\nAlternatively, since I already found that the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12, and there are 8 houses divisible by 12, that should be the number of houses with both blue and red doors.\n\nBut maybe to verify, I can calculate |A \u222a B|.\n\nThe number of houses with either blue or red doors would be |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nBut I don't know |A \u222a B|, and I don't really need it, because I'm only asked for |A \u2229 B|.\n\nSo, sticking with the first approach seems more straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses with both blue and red doors is 8.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states that to find the total number of elements in the union of two sets, you add the number in each set and subtract the intersection.\n\nBut again, I'm interested in the intersection.\n\nAlternatively, since being divisible by both 4 and 6 is the same as being divisible by their LCM, which is 12, I've already found that there are 8 such houses.\n\nI think that's the most direct way to solve this problem.\n\nSo, the final answer is 8 houses have both blue and red doors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
