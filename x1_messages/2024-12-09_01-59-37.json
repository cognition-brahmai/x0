        "content": "So I've got this problem here: In a room, there are 10 people, and each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. I need to figure out how many handshakes occur in total. Hmm, interesting. There are probably a few different ways to approach this. Let me think about it.\n\n**Method 1: The Formula Approach**\n\nI recall that in combinatorics, there's a formula for choosing pairs from a set. Since a handshake is between two people, it's essentially about choosing 2 people out of 10 without regard to order. So, the number of handshakes should be the number of combinations of 10 people taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. In this case, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\). Plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\cdot 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 45 handshakes. This seems straightforward and precise.\n\n**Method 2: The Sequential Counting Approach**\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider each person individually. The first person shakes hands with 9 other people. The second person has already shaken hands with the first person, so they shake hands with 8 remaining people. The third person has already shaken hands with the first two, so they shake hands with 7 remaining people, and so on, until the last person, who has already shaken hands with everyone else, so they shake hands with 0 people.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes is:\n\n\\[\n9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0\n\\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term \\( a = 9 \\), the last term \\( l = 0 \\), and the number of terms \\( n = 10 \\). The sum \\( s \\) of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{n(a + l)}{2} = \\frac{10(9 + 0)}{2} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nAgain, 45 handshakes. This method makes sense too, and it's helpful to see it from a different angle.\n\n**Method 3: The Graph Theory Approach**\n\nIf I think about this in terms of graph theory, where each person is a vertex and each handshake is an edge connecting two vertices, then the problem reduces to finding the number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices. In graph theory, a complete graph with \\( n \\) vertices has \\( \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\) edges.\n\nSo, for \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of edges} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nThis is consistent with the previous methods. It's interesting to see how different areas of mathematics can be applied to the same problem.\n\n**Method 4: The Pairing Approach**\n\nImagine all 10 people standing in a circle. Each person shakes hands with every other person except themselves. Since handshakes are between two people, each handshake is a unique pair. So, the total number of unique pairs is the same as the number of handshakes.\n\nTo find the number of unique pairs, I can use the combination formula again, which is essentially what I did in Method 1. But maybe there's another way to think about pairing.\n\nSuppose I list all possible pairs:\n\n- Person 1 shakes hands with persons 2 through 10 (9 handshakes)\n\n- Person 2 shakes hands with persons 3 through 10 (8 handshakes, since the handshake with person 1 is already counted)\n\n- And so on, until person 9 shakes hands with person 10 (1 handshake)\n\n- Person 10 has already shaken hands with everyone else, so 0 new handshakes\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 45\n\nThis is similar to Method 2, just thought about in terms of pairing.\n\n**Method 5: The Handshake Lemma from Graph Theory**\n\nIn graph theory, the Handshake Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this context, each person (vertex) shakes hands (edges) with others.\n\nIf there are 10 people, and each shakes hands with 9 others, the sum of the degrees is \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\). According to the Handshake Lemma, this sum is twice the number of edges (handshakes), so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of handshakes} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nThis is yet another way to arrive at the same answer using a different theorem from graph theory.\n\n**Ranking the Methods**\n\n1. **Method 1: The Formula Approach** - This is the most direct and efficient method. It requires minimal calculation and is based on a fundamental combinatorial formula. It's also the least time-consuming.\n\n2. **Method 2: The Sequential Counting Approach** - This method is straightforward but involves adding a sequence of numbers, which can be time-consuming for larger numbers. However, it's a good way to understand the underlying concept.\n\n3. **Method 3: The Graph Theory Approach** - This method is elegant and connects the problem to graph theory concepts. It's useful for those familiar with graph theory but might be overkill for a simple handshake problem.\n\n4. **Method 4: The Pairing Approach** - This is essentially the same as Method 1 but explained differently. It's a good way to reinforce the concept of unique pairs.\n\n5. **Method 5: The Handshake Lemma from Graph Theory** - This method is interesting but slightly more advanced, as it requires knowledge of the Handshake Lemma. It's not necessary for solving this problem but can be insightful for those studying graph theory.\n\n**Choosing the Best Method**\n\nGiven the simplicity and directness of Method 1, I would recommend using the combination formula for this problem. It's efficient, accurate, and requires minimal computation. Additionally, it's a fundamental approach that can be applied to similar problems involving combinations or selections.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]"
