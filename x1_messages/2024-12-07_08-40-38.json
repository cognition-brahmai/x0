        "content": "Let's see. There are originally 5 apples and 7 oranges in the basket. John takes 2 apples and 3 oranges from the basket. So, after he takes them, how many apples and oranges are left in the basket?\n\nOriginal apples: 5\nTaken apples: 2\nRemaining apples: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nOriginal oranges: 7\nTaken oranges: 3\nRemaining oranges: 7 - 3 = 4\n\nSo, there are 3 apples and 4 oranges left in the basket.\n\nNow, John has 2 apples and 3 oranges with him. The question is, how many fruits does he need to put back into the basket so that there are equal numbers of apples and oranges in the basket?\n\nLet's denote the number of apples John puts back as A and the number of oranges as O.\n\nAfter putting back A apples and O oranges, the number of apples in the basket will be 3 + A, and the number of oranges will be 4 + O.\n\nWe want these to be equal:\n\n3 + A = 4 + O\n\nLet's solve for A in terms of O:\n\nA = 4 + O - 3\nA = 1 + O\n\nSo, for every orange John puts back, he needs to put back 1 more apple than oranges.\n\nBut John has only 2 apples and 3 oranges with him.\n\nLet's consider the possible values for O (0, 1, 2, 3) and see what A would be:\n\nIf O = 0, then A = 1 + 0 = 1\nIf O = 1, then A = 1 + 1 = 2\nIf O = 2, then A = 1 + 2 = 3\nIf O = 3, then A = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, John has only 2 apples and 3 oranges.\n\nSo, for O = 0, A = 1 (possible, since John has 2 apples)\nFor O = 1, A = 2 (possible)\nFor O = 2, A = 3 (John only has 2 apples, so not possible)\nFor O = 3, A = 4 (not possible)\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Put back 1 apple and 0 oranges.\n2. Put back 2 apples and 1 orange.\n\nLet's check these:\n\n1. Put back 1 apple and 0 oranges:\n   Apples in basket: 3 + 1 = 4\n   Oranges in basket: 4 + 0 = 4\n   Equal numbers: yes\n\n2. Put back 2 apples and 1 orange:\n   Apples in basket: 3 + 2 = 5\n   Oranges in basket: 4 + 1 = 5\n   Equal numbers: yes\n\nSo, there are two possible ways for John to put back fruits to make the numbers equal.\n\nBut the question is, how many fruits does he need to put back? So, we need to find the total number of fruits in each case.\n\n1. 1 apple + 0 oranges = 1 fruit\n2. 2 apples + 1 orange = 3 fruits\n\nWait a minute, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says \"how many fruits does he need to put back into the basket so that there are equal numbers of apples and oranges.\"\n\nIt might be asking for the minimal number of fruits he needs to put back to achieve equality.\n\nIn the first scenario, he puts back only 1 apple, totaling 1 fruit.\n\nIn the second scenario, he puts back 3 fruits.\n\nSo, the minimal number is 1 fruit.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are other possibilities.\n\nIs there a way to put back fewer than 1 fruit? No, since he can't put back a fraction of a fruit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nWait, maybe John can only put back one type of fruit.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nIf John puts back only apples, how many does he need to put back to make the numbers equal?\n\nCurrently, there are 3 apples and 4 oranges in the basket.\n\nSo, if he puts back A apples, then apples in basket: 3 + A\n\nOranges remain 4.\n\nSet equal: 3 + A = 4\n\nSo, A = 1\n\nTherefore, he puts back 1 apple.\n\nSimilarly, if he puts back only oranges:\n\nLet\u2019s say he puts back O oranges, then oranges in basket: 4 + O\n\nApples remain 3.\n\nSet equal: 4 + O = 3\n\nSo, O = -1\n\nBut he can't put back negative oranges; that would mean taking more oranges away.\n\nSo, he can't make the numbers equal by putting back only oranges; he needs to put back apples.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of fruits he needs to put back is 1 apple.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that putting back 2 apples and 1 orange also makes the numbers equal, but that's more fruits.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1 fruit.\n\nBut let's consider if there are other combinations where he puts back both apples and oranges.\n\nFrom earlier, A = 1 + O\n\nAnd A and O must be integers greater than or equal to 0.\n\nAlso, A cannot exceed the number of apples John has, which is 2, and O cannot exceed the number of oranges he has, which is 3.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are A=1, O=0 and A=2, O=1, as previously determined.\n\nThus, the minimal number of fruits to put back is 1 (only 1 apple).\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
