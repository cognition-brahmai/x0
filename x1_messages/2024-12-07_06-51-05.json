        "content": "Let's see. There's a store having a sale where everything is discounted by 20%. I have an item that originally costs $75, and I want to know how much a customer saves with this discount.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 20% discount means. Percentage discounts are common in sales, and they represent the reduction in price based on the original cost. So, a 20% discount means the customer pays 20% less than the original price.\n\nTo find out how much is saved, I need to calculate 20% of $75. The formula for calculating a percentage of a number is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Savings} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \\right) \\times \\text{Original Price}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Savings} = \\left( \\frac{20}{100} \\right) \\times 75\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{100} = 0.2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Savings} = 0.2 \\times 75\n\\]\n\nNow, multiplying 0.2 by 75:\n\n\\[\n0.2 \\times 75 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the customer saves $15 on the item.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify this calculation. Another way to look at it is to calculate the sale price and then see the difference.\n\nIf the original price is $75 and there's a 20% discount, the sale price would be 80% of the original price because 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nSo, sale price = 80% of $75.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sale Price} = \\left( \\frac{80}{100} \\right) \\times 75 = 0.8 \\times 75 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, the sale price is $60.\n\nNow, the savings would be the original price minus the sale price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Savings} = 75 - 60 = 15\n\\]\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, the customer saves $15.\n\nJust to explore this further, let's consider if the discount was applied differently. For example, if there was a tiered discount or if there were multiple discounts. But in this case, it's a straightforward 20% discount, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that this $15 saving is specific to this item. If the customer buys multiple items, the total savings would be different.\n\nMoreover, sales tax might affect the final amount paid, but since the question is about how much is saved due to the discount, and not about the final price including tax, I can assume that tax is not a factor here.\n\nIn conclusion, with a 20% discount on an item originally costing $75, the customer saves $15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
