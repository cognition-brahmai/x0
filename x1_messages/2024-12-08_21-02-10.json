        "content": "So the community center is hosting a talent show, and they need to figure out how many chairs to rent for the audience. They can hold up to 200 people, but they're only expecting 75% of that to show up. Each chair costs $2 to rent, and they've got a budget of $400. I need to figure out how many chairs they should rent and make sure they don't go over budget.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many people are expected to attend. They expect a 75% turnout rate for 200 people. So, I'll calculate 75% of 200.\n\n75% of 200 is calculated as 0.75 times 200, which is 150 people.\n\nSo, they're expecting 150 people to show up.\n\nNow, they need to rent chairs for these 150 people. Each chair costs $2 to rent.\n\nSo, the cost for 150 chairs would be 150 chairs times $2 per chair, which is $300.\n\nTheir budget is $400, so $300 is within their budget.\n\nBut wait, maybe they want to have some extra chairs just in case more people show up than expected. It's always good to have a few extras.\n\nLet's see, if they want to rent extra chairs, how many can they afford with their $400 budget?\n\nFirst, the cost for 150 chairs is $300. So, they have $400 minus $300, which is $100 left in the budget.\n\nEach additional chair costs $2, so with $100, they can rent 50 additional chairs.\n\nSo, they could rent up to 150 plus 50, which is 200 chairs in total, but they only expect 150 people.\n\nBut, they can only hold 200 people in the center, so renting 200 chairs would fill the center to its maximum capacity.\n\nHowever, since they only expect 150 people, renting 200 chairs might be overkill, but it's within their budget.\n\nAlternatively, they could rent just the 150 chairs needed, which would cost $300, and save the remaining $100 for other expenses.\n\nOr, they could rent 150 chairs and have some extra chairs, say 10 or 20, as backups.\n\nLet's see, if they rent 160 chairs, that would be 160 times $2, which is $320. Still within the $400 budget.\n\nSimilarly, 170 chairs would be $340, 180 chairs $360, 190 chairs $380, and 200 chairs $400.\n\nSo, they can choose anywhere between 150 and 200 chairs based on their preference for extra space or maximizing seating.\n\nIf they rent 200 chairs, it would cost exactly $400, which uses up their entire budget.\n\nBut if they think that not all expected 150 people will come, they might not need that many chairs.\n\nOn the other hand, if more people show up, having extra chairs ensures that everyone has a seat.\n\nThey should also consider other factors, like whether there will be additional guests or if there are people who might not have registered but still show up.\n\nAlternatively, they could set aside a buffer of, say, 10 chairs, to account for any surprises.\n\nSo, if they expect 150 people and add 10 chairs as a buffer, that's 160 chairs, costing $320, which is well within their $400 budget.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if they want a larger buffer, they could rent more chairs accordingly.\n\nBut, they should also consider that the venue can only hold up to 200 people, so renting more than 200 chairs wouldn't make sense.\n\nMoreover, renting exactly 200 chairs would use up their entire budget, leaving no room for other potential expenses.\n\nTherefore, it's probably wise to rent fewer chairs and save some money for other needs.\n\nIn conclusion, they should rent around 150 to 160 chairs, which would cost between $300 and $320, staying well within their $400 budget, while also accommodating the expected audience with a small buffer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150 \\text{ to } 160 \\text{ chairs}} \\]"
