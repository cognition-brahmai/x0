        "content": "So I've got this limit to evaluate: the limit as x approaches infinity of (2x^2 + 3x)/(x^2 - 1). Hmm, at first glance, it looks like a rational function where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials of degree 2. I remember that when dealing with limits of rational functions as x approaches infinity, the behavior is determined by the leading terms of the numerator and the denominator.\n\nLet me write down the function again to see it clearly:\n\nf(x) = (2x^2 + 3x)/(x^2 - 1)\n\nOkay, so both the numerator and the denominator have x^2 as their highest power. Maybe I can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by x^2, which is the highest power in the denominator. That often helps when dealing with limits at infinity.\n\nSo, let's divide numerator and denominator by x^2:\n\nNumerator: (2x^2 + 3x)/x^2 = 2 + 3/x\n\nDenominator: (x^2 - 1)/x^2 = 1 - 1/x^2\n\nSo now, the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = (2 + 3/x)/(1 - 1/x^2)\n\nAlright, now as x approaches infinity, I know that terms like 3/x and 1/x^2 approach zero. So, let's consider what happens to each term as x gets larger and larger.\n\nAs x approaches infinity:\n\n- 3/x approaches 0\n\n- 1/x^2 approaches 0\n\nSo, the numerator approaches 2 + 0 = 2\n\nThe denominator approaches 1 - 0 = 1\n\nTherefore, the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity should be 2/1 = 2.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to confirm this? Maybe I can try plugging in really large values of x and see if the function approaches 2.\n\nLet's pick x = 1000:\n\nf(1000) = (2*(1000)^2 + 3*1000)/(1000^2 - 1) = (2,000,000 + 3,000)/(1,000,000 - 1) = 2,003,000 / 999,999 \u2248 2.003\n\nThat's pretty close to 2.\n\nLet's try x = 1,000,000:\n\nf(1,000,000) = (2*(1,000,000)^2 + 3*1,000,000)/(1,000,000)^2 - 1) = (2,000,000,000,000 + 3,000,000)/(1,000,000,000,000 - 1) \u2248 2,000,003,000,000 / 999,999,999,999 \u2248 2.000002\n\nEven closer to 2.\n\nThis seems to confirm that the limit is indeed 2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can use L'H\u00f4pital's Rule, since as x approaches infinity, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity, which is an indeterminate form \u221e/\u221e.\n\nL'H\u00f4pital's Rule states that if the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x approaches some value is \u221e/\u221e or 0/0, then the limit of f(x)/g(x) is equal to the limit of f'(x)/g'(x), where f' and g' are the derivatives of f and g, respectively.\n\nSo, let's try differentiating the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 2x^2 + 3x\n\nDerivative: 4x + 3\n\nDenominator: x^2 - 1\n\nDerivative: 2x\n\nSo, applying L'H\u00f4pital's Rule:\n\nLimit as x approaches infinity of (4x + 3)/(2x)\n\nNow, this still gives us \u221e/\u221e, so maybe I can apply L'H\u00f4pital's Rule again.\n\nDifferentiate numerator and denominator again:\n\nNumerator: 4\n\nDenominator: 2\n\nSo, limit as x approaches infinity of 4/2 = 2\n\nAgain, I get 2. This matches my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider factoring out the highest power of x in the numerator and the denominator.\n\nSo, f(x) = (x^2(2 + 3/x))/(x^2(1 - 1/x^2)) = (2 + 3/x)/(1 - 1/x^2)\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, and as x approaches infinity, it approaches 2/1 = 2.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that for very large x, the lower degree terms become negligible compared to the higher degree terms.\n\nSo, in the numerator, 2x^2 dominates over 3x, and in the denominator, x^2 dominates over -1.\n\nTherefore, for large x, f(x) \u2248 2x^2 / x^2 = 2.\n\nThis again suggests that the limit is 2.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways: by simplifying the expression, by plugging in large values, by using L'H\u00f4pital's Rule, and by considering the dominant terms.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the limit as x approaches infinity of (2x^2 + 3x)/(x^2 - 1) is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
