        "content": "Let's see. So, the store is offering a discount where customers pay only 75% of the original price. That means the customer is paying 75% of what the product originally costs. If a customer pays $45 after the discount, I need to find out what the original price was.\n\nHmm, percentage problems can sometimes confuse me, but let's break it down step by step. So, if the customer pays 75% of the original price, that 75% is equal to $45. I need to find 100% of the original price.\n\nI remember that percentages can be converted to decimals for easier calculations. So, 75% is the same as 0.75 in decimal form. So, 0.75 times the original price equals $45.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n0.75 * original price = $45\n\nNow, to find the original price, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75.\n\nSo,\n\noriginal price = $45 / 0.75\n\nLet me do the division.\n\n45 divided by 0.75.\n\nWell, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3.\n\nSo, $45 * (4/3) =\n\nFirst, 45 times 4 is 180.\n\nThen, 180 divided by 3 is 60.\n\nSo, the original price was $60.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nIf the original price is $60 and the discount is 25%, meaning they pay only 75% of it, then 75% of $60 should be $45.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n75% of $60 is 0.75 * 60 = $45.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 75% corresponds to $45, then 100% corresponds to x.\n\nSo, I can set up the proportion:\n\n75% / 100% = $45 / x\n\nThen, solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n75% * x = 100% * $45\n\nSo,\n\n0.75x = 1 * 45\n\nThen,\n\nx = 45 / 0.75\n\nAgain, that's $60.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about what percentage $45 is of the original price.\n\nIf $45 is 75% of the original price, then to find the original price, I can set up the equation:\n\n$45 = 75% of original price\n\nSo,\n\n$45 = 0.75 * original price\n\nThen, original price = $45 / 0.75 = $60\n\nConsistent with the previous methods.\n\nLet me consider another approach to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nSuppose the original price is x dollars.\n\nThe discount is 25%, meaning they save 25% of x.\n\nSo, the customer pays 75% of x, which is $45.\n\nSo,\n\n0.75x = $45\n\nTherefore, x = $45 / 0.75 = $60\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the amount saved.\n\nIf the original price is $60 and the discount is 25%, then the amount saved is 25% of $60, which is $15.\n\nSo, the customer pays $60 - $15 = $45, which matches the given information.\n\nEverything seems consistent.\n\nI think the original price of the product was $60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
