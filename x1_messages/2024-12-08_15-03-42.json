        "content": "So I've got this problem here. There's a class of 40 students, and out of them, 25 passed the exam with an average score of 80, and the remaining students, which would be 15, failed with an average score of 50. I need to find out what the overall average score of the entire class is.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what an average is. The average score is the total sum of all the scores divided by the number of scores. So, for the whole class, the overall average would be the total sum of all students' scores divided by the total number of students, which is 40.\n\nSo, the formula for the overall average is:\n\nOverall Average = (Total Sum of Scores) / (Total Number of Students)\n\nI know the total number of students is 40. Now, I need to find the total sum of scores.\n\nI can think of the total sum of scores as the sum of the scores of the students who passed plus the sum of the scores of the students who failed.\n\nSo, Total Sum of Scores = Sum of Scores of Passes + Sum of Scores of Fails\n\nI know that 25 students passed with an average score of 80. So, the sum of their scores would be the number of students who passed times their average score.\n\nSum of Scores of Passes = 25 students * 80 = 2000\n\nSimilarly, the remaining 15 students failed with an average score of 50. So, the sum of their scores would be:\n\nSum of Scores of Fails = 15 students * 50 = 750\n\nNow, the total sum of scores is 2000 + 750 = 2750\n\nSo, the overall average is 2750 divided by 40.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n2750 \u00f7 40\n\nWell, 40 * 68.75 = 2750\n\nSo, the overall average score is 68.75\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\nI have 25 students with 80 each and 15 with 50 each.\n\nSum of passes: 25 * 80 = 2000\n\nSum of fails: 15 * 50 = 750\n\nTotal sum: 2000 + 750 = 2750\n\nTotal students: 40\n\nAverage: 2750 / 40 = 68.75\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of weighted averages.\n\nThe overall average is a weighted average of the two groups' averages, weighted by the number of students in each group.\n\nSo, Overall Average = (Number of Passes / Total Students) * Average of Passes + (Number of Fails / Total Students) * Average of Fails\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nOverall Average = (25/40)*80 + (15/40)*50\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, 25/40 = 0.625\n\n0.625 * 80 = 50\n\nThen, 15/40 = 0.375\n\n0.375 * 50 = 18.75\n\nNow, add them together: 50 + 18.75 = 68.75\n\nSame answer as before, which is a good sign.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me consider the difference between the passes and fails.\n\nPasses have an average of 80, fails have an average of 50.\n\nThe difference is 30 points.\n\nNow, the passes are 25 students, fails are 15 students.\n\nSo, the passes have a higher score, and there are more passes than fails.\n\nIntuitively, the overall average should be closer to the passes' average than the fails' average.\n\nGiven that, 68.75 is between 50 and 80, and it's closer to 80, which makes sense because more students passed.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of total points contributed by each group.\n\nPasses contribute 25 * 80 = 2000\n\nFails contribute 15 * 50 = 750\n\nTotal points: 2750\n\nAverage: 2750 / 40 = 68.75\n\nEverything points to 68.75 being the correct answer.\n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nSuppose I consider the entire class's scores as a combination of two groups.\n\nGroup 1: 25 students with an average of 80.\n\nGroup 2: 15 students with an average of 50.\n\nThe overall average should be the sum of the products of each group's average and their proportion of the total class.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier: (25/40)*80 + (15/40)*50 = 68.75\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of centroid or weighted mean.\n\nBut I think I've confirmed it enough ways.\n\nI can also check if the total sum makes sense.\n\n25 students * 80 = 2000\n\n15 students * 50 = 750\n\nTotal sum: 2750\n\n40 students, average = 2750 / 40 = 68.75\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think I need to look for any other methods, as multiple approaches lead to the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the overall average score of the entire class is 68.75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{68.75} \\]"
