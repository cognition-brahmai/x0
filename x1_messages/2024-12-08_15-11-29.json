        "content": "So the restaurant serves 150 customers per day on average, and each customer spends about $25. We need to find out the total revenue after 3 years, assuming nothing changes.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the daily revenue. If each of the 150 customers spends $25, then the daily revenue would be:\n\n150 customers/day * $25/customer = $3,750/day\n\nNow, to find the annual revenue, we need to know how many days are in a year. Typically, a year has 365 days. So,\n\n$3,750/day * 365 days/year = $1,368,750/year\n\nBut wait, some years are leap years, which have 366 days. Since the question says \"assuming no changes,\" I'll stick with 365 days for simplicity, unless specified otherwise.\n\nNow, for 3 years, the total revenue would be:\n\n$1,368,750/year * 3 years = $4,106,250\n\nSo, the total revenue after 3 years would be $4,106,250.\n\nBut let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the annual revenue first, as I did, and then multiply by 3. Or, calculate the total number of days in 3 years and multiply by the daily revenue.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTotal days in 3 years: 3 * 365 = 1,095 days\n\nTotal revenue: $3,750/day * 1,095 days = $4,106,250\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nWait a minute, but in reality, every 4 years has a leap year with 366 days. So, in a 3-year period, there might be one leap year, depending on which years they are.\n\nFor example, if the 3 years include one leap year, then the total days would be:\n\n2 * 365 + 366 = 730 + 366 = 1,096 days\n\nBut the question says \"assuming no changes,\" which might imply that we shouldn't account for leap years, or perhaps we should consider the average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average day count per year is 365.25 to account for leap years.\n\nIf we use 365.25 days/year, then for 3 years:\n\n3 * 365.25 = 1,095.75 days\n\nThen, total revenue:\n\n$3,750/day * 1,095.75 days = $4,109,062.50\n\nBut this is a bit more than the earlier calculation.\n\nHowever, the question seems to assume straightforward calculations without considering leap years, given the \"no changes\" clause.\n\nTherefore, the first calculation is likely sufficient: $4,106,250.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors we should account for.\n\nAre there any holidays or closed days? The question doesn't mention anything like that, so we'll assume the restaurant is open every day.\n\nAlso, it says \"on average 150 customers per day,\" so variations are already accounted for in that average.\n\nMoreover, it assumes no change in customer numbers or spending habits, so we don't have to worry about increases or decreases over time.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue after 3 years would be $4,106,250.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4106250} \\]"
