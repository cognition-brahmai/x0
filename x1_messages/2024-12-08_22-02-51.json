        "content": "So there are 5 red balls and 7 blue balls in a bag, making a total of 12 balls. I need to find the probability that both balls drawn at random will be red.\n\nFirst, I should remember that probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 12 is calculated using combinations, since the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 12 is C(12, 2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = 66.\n\nSo, there are 66 possible ways to draw 2 balls from 12.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of 5.\n\nSo, that's C(5, 2).\n\nCalculating C(5, 2):\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3!)) = (5 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose 2 red balls from 5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 10 / 66.\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2, which gives 5 / 33.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/33.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem, maybe using probabilities directly without combinations?\n\nYes, I can think of it step by step.\n\nThe probability that the first ball drawn is red is 5/12, since there are 5 red balls out of 12 total balls.\n\nThen, given that the first ball was red, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 11 balls left in the bag.\n\nSo, the probability that the second ball is also red, given that the first one was red, is 4/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls are red is the product of these two probabilities: (5/12) \u00d7 (4/11) = 20/132.\n\nSimplifying 20/132 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4 gives 5/33.\n\nSo, I get the same answer using this method.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 5/33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{33}} \\]"
