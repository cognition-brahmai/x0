        "content": "Let's dive into this question about architectural styles. So, we're talking about a style that really emphasized function over form and started using new materials like steel and concrete. That sounds pretty interesting.\n\nFirst off, let's recall what each of these styles is known for:\n\n- **Gothic**: This is the style famous for those towering cathedrals with their pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and lots of ornate details. It's all about verticality and light, trying to reach towards heaven, I guess. Not really known for simplicity or functionality.\n\n- **Renaissance**: This comes after Gothic and is all about symmetry, proportion, and classical orders. Think of buildings like the Pantheon in Rome or the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. It's a return to the principles of ancient Greece and Rome, emphasizing harmony and balance. Again, functionality isn't the primary focus here; it's more about aesthetics and aligning with classical ideals.\n\n- **Modernism**: Now, this one sounds promising. Modernism is all about breaking away from traditional styles and embracing new technologies and materials. The idea is that form should follow function\u2014meaning that the design of a building should be based on its intended use, rather than adhering to pre-existing styles. Steel and concrete are key materials here because they allow for more flexibility in design and larger structures.\n\n- **Sustainable Design**: This is a more recent approach that focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of buildings. It incorporates things like energy efficiency, use of renewable materials, and strategies to reduce waste. While it does consider function and the use of materials, its primary focus is on sustainability and environmental responsibility.\n\nSo, going back to the question: which style is characterized by a focus on function over form and the use of new materials like steel and concrete?\n\nLooking at the options, Gothic and Renaissance both have strong aesthetic traditions and aren't really known for prioritizing function over form. Sustainable design, while it does consider function and materials, is more focused on environmental impact.\n\nThat leaves Modernism. It seems to fit the bill perfectly. Modernist architects were all about embracing new materials and technologies to create functional, often minimalist structures. Think of buildings like the Lever House in New York or the Farnsworth House by Mies van der Rohe. These structures are iconic for their use of steel and glass, and their designs are tailored to the specific functions they serve.\n\nBut to make sure, let's think a bit more. Maybe sustainable design also uses steel and concrete. Actually, sustainable buildings often use materials like these, but they do so with an eye towards sustainability\u2014using recycled materials, ensuring energy efficiency, and so on. So while they might use similar materials, the primary focus is different.\n\nSimilarly, some Renaissance buildings might have been functional, but their design was still very much rooted in classical aesthetics and proportions.\n\nGothic architecture, despite its grandeur, was functional in its own way\u2014cathedrals were designed for worship and often served as centers of community life. But again, the aesthetic was paramount, with lots of decorative elements.\n\nTherefore, the style that most clearly emphasizes function over form and makes use of new materials like steel and concrete is Modernism.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Modernism.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other styles that might fit this description. For example, there's Brutalism, which is sometimes considered a subset of Modernism. Brutalist buildings often feature bare concrete and are known for their imposing forms, but even they are part of the Modernist movement.\n\nAdditionally, there's Postmodernism, which emerged as a reaction to Modernism. Postmodern buildings often incorporate elements of previous styles and emphasize decoration and context over pure function.\n\nSo, in comparison, Modernism is the style that most distinctly prioritizes function and makes use of new materials.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Modernism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
